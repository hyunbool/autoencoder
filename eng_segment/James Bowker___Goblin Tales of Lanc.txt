comparative notesintroduction</s> for many of the superstitions which still cling to him the lancashireman of the present day is indebted to his celtic and scandinavianancestors</s>  from them the horse and worm stories and the giant lore ofthe northern and southern mountains and fells have come down whilethe relationship of the jinny greenteeth the presiding nymph of theponds and streams with allusions to whom the lancastrian motherstrives to deter her little ones from venturing near the pits andbrooks to the waterspirits of the gothic mythology is too evidentto admit of any doubt</s>  the source of the gabriel ratchets thehellhounds whose fearinspiring yelps still are heard by thebenighted peasant who finds in the dread sound a warning of theapproach of the angel of death in the norse aasgaardsveia the soulscondemned to ride about the world until doomsday and who gallopthrough the midnight storm with shrieks and cries which ring over thelonely moors or in that other troop of souls of the brave ones whohad died in battle being led by the stormgod woden to walhalla alsois undeniable</s> striking however as are the points of similitude between some of thelancastrian traditions and those of the north of europe others seemto be peculiar to the county and that these are of a darker andgloomier cast than are the superstitions of districts less wild andmountainous and away from the weird influence of the sea with itswinter thunderings suggestive of hidden and awful power may in agreat measure be correctly attributed to the nature of the scenery</s> it is easy to understand how the unlettered peasant would people withbeings of another world either the bleak fells the deep and gloomygorges the wild cloughs the desolate moorland wastes two or threethousand feet above the level of the sea of the eastern portion ofthe county or the salt marshes where the breezebent andmysteriouslooking trees waved their spectral boughs in the wind thedark pools fringed with reeds amid which the pegolantronflickered and danced and over which came the hollow cry of thebittern and the childlike plaint of the plover and the dreary glensdark lakes and long stretches of sand of the north and west</s> to him the forest with its solemn rembrandtesque gloom where druids erst heard victims groanthe lonely fircrowned pikes and the mistshrouded mountains wouldseem fitting homes for the dread shapes whose spite ended itself inthe misfortunes and misery of humanity</s>  pregnant with mystery to sucha mind would be the huge fells with their shifting neetcaps ofcloud the towering bluffs the swampy moors and trackless morassesacross which the setting sun cast floods of bloodred light andirresistible would be the influence of such scenery upon the lonelylabourer who would go about his daily tasks with a feeling that he wassurrounded by the supernatural</s> and wild as are many parts of the county today it is difficult toconceive its condition a century or two ago when much of the landwas not only uncultivated but was for at least a portion of theyear covered by sheets of water the highways being little more thanbridle roads or if wider than usual very sloughs of despond thecarts in several of the rural districts being laid aside in winter asutterly useless and grain and other commodities even in summer timebeing conveyed from place to place on the backs of long strings ofpackhorses</s> living in lonely houses and cottages shut out from civilisation by thedifficulties of communication and hemmed in by floating mists and bymuch that was aweinspiring with in winter additional barriers ofstorm snow and flood it is easy to imagine how in the fancy of theyeoman shepherd farmer or solitary lime burner as th edge odark threw its weird glamour over the scene boggarts and phantomswould begin to creep about to the music of the unearthly voices heardin every sough and sigh of the wandering wind as it wailed around theisolated dwellings</s> in everything weird they found a message from the unknown realms ofdeath</s>  the noise of the swollen waters of the ribble or the lune orthe many smaller streams hurrying down to the sea was to them thevoice of the water spirit calling for its victim and the howling oftheir dogs bade the sick prepare to meet the shadow with the keys</s> all around them were invisible beings harmful or mischievous and tothem they traced much of the misfortune which followed the sternworking of natures laws</s> the superstitions which date from as well as the actual annals of thewitch mania in lancashire in some slight degree confirm this theoryfor whereas in the flat and more thicklypopulated districts the hagcontented herself with stealing milk from her neighbours cowsspoiling their bakings and other practical jokes of a comparativelyharmless kind in the wilder localitiesthe region of pathless moorsand mistencircled mountainsthe witch ever was raising terriblestorms bringing down the thunder killing the cattle dealing outplagues and pestilence at will wreaking evil of every conceivablekind upon man and beast and hot from her sabbath of devilworshipeven casting the sombre shadows and dread darkness of death over thehouseholds of those who had fallen under the ban of her hate</s> lancashire has however an extensive ghost lore to which this theoryhas no reference consisting as it does of stories of haunted housesand churchyards indelible bloodstains and all the paraphernalia ofthe     shapes that walk at dead of night and clank their chains and wave the torch of hell around the murderers bed</s> the sketch in this volume mother and child for the skeleton ofwhich tradition i am indebted to the late mr</s>  j</s>  stanyan bigg may beconsidered a fair specimen of these stories</s>  in most cases theselegends are not simply the vain creations of ignorance and darknessalthough they fade before the light of knowledge like mists before thesun for under many of them may be found a moral and a warning or atestimony to the beauty of goodness hidden it is true beneath thecovering of a rude fable just as inscriptions rest concealed belowthe moss of graveyards</s>  the wellknown legend of the boggart oftownley hall with its warning cry of lay out lay out</s>  and itsdemand for a victim every seventh year is a striking example oftraditions of this classemphatic protests against wrong uttered inthe form of a nerveaffecting fable</s>  in more than one of the storiesof this kind to which i have listened the ghost of the victim hasrevisited the pale glimpses of the moon and made night so hideousto the wrongdoer that in despair and remorse he has put an end tohimself and trivial as these things may seem to mr</s>  gradgrind and hisschool they have like other and nobler parables influenced mindsimpervious to dry fact</s> to the devil lore of the county however the theory certainly willapply for surely it is in a gloomy gorge through which forkedlightnings flash and chase each other and the thunder rolls andreverberates or on a dark and lonesome moor rather than upon theshady side of pall mall one would expect to meet the evil one</s> yet undoubtedly other causes contributed to enrich the store oftales of fiends with which the county abounds</s> in lancashire many of the old customs even such as the riding of thewooden christ on palm sunday continued to be kept up at a laterperiod than was the case in other parts of england andnotwithstanding the prohibitory edicts of the commissioners appointedby queen elizabeth miracle plays and moralities doubtless wereperformed there even during the early part of the reign of james i</s> for the reformation rapidly as its principles took root and spread inother parts of the country did not make rapid headway in lancashirewhere great numbers of the people remained true to the faith of theirforefathers</s>  in fact in many parishes long after the church ofengland had been by law established catholic priests continued to bethe only officiating ministers</s>  probably the people loved their churchnot only on account of its doctrines of which it may be presumed mostof them knew but little and of its impressive ceremonies but alsobecause of its recognition of the holy days and fair days wakes andgames it was powerless to suppress and perhaps of all the amusementsthus winked at or even patronised by the church that of dramaticrepresentations rude and grotesque as they undoubtedly were was themost important</s>  in many places the members of the various guilds andbrotherhoods were the performers but in the majority of cases theentertainments were given by the priests and other ecclesiasticalfunctionaries</s> what part the devil played in these amusements is well known to theantiquary the old accounts containing particulars of the expenditureupon not only hair for the evil ones wig but also for canvas ofwhich to construct black shirts for the satanic tagrag or as theold scribes plainly put it for the damned</s>  it is evident from theold records that satan left the hands of his dresser an objectcompared with which the most hideous jackinthebox of the modern toyshop would be a vision of loveliness and as his chief occupationswere those of roaring and yelling and of suffering all sorts ofindignities at the hands of the vice as does the pantaloon at thehands of the clown in a pantomime of today it is easy to see thathis rle was not a very dignified one</s>  everywhere the stage devilwas simply the stage fool</s>  even in france where the drama ever hasbeen submitted to precise rules there was as albert reville hasremarked histoire du diable ses origines sa grandeur et sadecadence</s>  strasbourg 1870 a class of popular pieces calleddevilries diableries gross and often obscene masquerades inwhich at least four devils took part</s> </s> </s> </s>  in germany also the devilwas diverting on the stage</s>  there exists an old saxon mystery of thepassion in which satan repeats like a mocking echo the last wordsof judas who hangs himself and when in accordance with the sacredtradition the traitors bowels fall asunder the evil one gathersthem into a basket and as he carries them away sings alittle melody appropriate to the occasion</s>  undoubtedly thesemisrepresentations of the apostate angel helped to familiarise thepopular mind with the idea of a personal devil going about veritablyseeking whom he might devour and although when with the crowd in thepresence of the thespian ecclesiastics people might feel quite athome with and really enjoy the company of the evil one away againon the dreary moor or in the lonely hillside cottage with the nightwind howling at the door fear would resume its wonted supremacy andthe feeling would be deepened and intensified by the memory of thehorrid appearance of the stage satan</s> it is possible that in a great measure we owe to these performancesthe somewhat monotonous frequency with which in the purely locallancashire devil stories the evil one who generally in the moststupid manner permits himself to be overreached comes oft secondbest for doubtless many of the traditions were moulded in accordancewith the lot of satan in the miracle plays as in their turn thesewere although perhaps indirectly based upon the teachings of thechurch and that in its turn upon the writings of the fathers someof whom and notably origen did not hesitate to speak of theredemption even as due in no small degree to satanic stupidity a viewso lastingly predominant in the church that as reville has said lapoesie ecclsiastique la prdication populaire des enseignementspontificaux mme le repandirent le dramatisrent le consacrrentpartout</s> an interesting chapter in the history of religious beliefs might bewritten upon the views of the early fathers with reference to satanand his legion and the student is not inclined to be quite so severeupon the superstitions of the unlettered peasant when he finds jeromerecording it as the opinion of all the doctors in the church that theair between heaven and earth is filled with evil spirits andaugustine and others stating that the devils had fallen there from ahigher and purer region of the air</s>  the early christian church too hadits order of exorcists who had care of those possessed by evilspirits the energumeni and the bishops departing from theoriginal idea that laymen had the power of exorcism ordained men tothe office and called upon them to exercise their functions evenbefore the rite of baptism to deliver the candidates from thedominion of the power of darkness</s> of the lighter superstitions in lancashire that of belief in fairiesappears to be almost extinct and it is to be lamented that fortyyears ago folk lore was considered of so little importance for theslight and vague references in a rare little history of blackpoolby the rev</s>  w</s>  thornber upon two of which the sketches entitled thesilver token and the fairys spade are founded show that the taskof gathering a goodly store of such vestiges of ancient faiths wouldat the time when that volume was written have been a comparativelyeasy one</s>  today however the case is different</s>  even my friend thelate mr</s>  john higson of lees to whose kindness i owe the traditionupon which the story of the king of the fairies is based and whoselabours in outoftheway paths dear to antiquaries were for someyears as untiring as successful and praiseworthy was not able togather much bearing upon the fairy mythology of the lancashire people</s> most of the fairy and folk stories it was my good fortune to hear inthe county and moorland districts were of a conventional kind lubberfiends death warnings fairy ointment and fairy money being asplentiful as diamonds in eastern tales and for that reason it was notthought necessary to reproduce them in this volume</s> the darker forms of superstition like lower organisms are moretenacious of life and in many a retired nook of lancashire therestill may be found small congregations of believers in all the mysticlore of devildom and witchcraft</s>  readers of mr</s>  edwin waughsexquisite sketches of north country life will at once call to mind inthe grave of the griselhurst boggart an illustration of that dimfear of the supernatural which is yet so allpowerful while thevaluable collection of folk lore from the pens of the late mr</s> wilkinson and mr</s>  john harland is full of testimony to the vitality ofmany of these offshoots from oldworld creeds</s>
goblin tales of lancashire</s> th skriker shrieker</s> on a fine night about the middle of december many years ago asturdylooking young fellow left chipping for his cottage three orfour miles away upon the banks of the hodder</s>  the ground was coveredwith snow which in many places had drifted into heaps and the keenfrost had made the road so slippery that the progress he made was butslow</s>  nature looked very beautiful and the heart of the rustic evenwas touched by the sweet peacefulness of the scene</s>  the noble oldparlick and the sweeping longridge with its fircrowned thornleyheight and kemple end stood out boldly against the clear sky and themoon shed her soft silvery light into the long silent valleystretching away until its virgin paleness mingled with the shadows andthe darkness of the distant fells beyond whitewell</s> all was still save when the sighing wind rustled gently through thefrosted branches of the leafless trees by the roadside and shook downupon the wayfarer a miniature shower of snow for even the tinystream so full of mirth and music in the summer time had been lulledto sleep by the genius of winter and the cottagers whose littlehouses halfhidden by the rime seemed hardly large enough for thedwellings of dwarfs had been snugly sleeping for hours</s> adam was by no means a timid or nervous being but there was anameless something in the deathly silence which oppressed if it didnot actually frighten him and although he sang aloud a verse of thelast song he had heard before he left the kitchen of the patten armshis voice had lost its heartiness</s>  he earnestly wished himself safelyacross the little bridge over the brook but he was yet some distancefrom the stream when the faint chimes of midnight fell upon the air</s> almost immediately after the last stroke of twelve had broken thesilence a cloud passed over the face of the moon and comparativedarkness enveloped the scene the wind which before had been gentleand almost noiseless began to howl amid the boughs and branches ofthe waving trees and the frozen snow from the hedgerows was dashedagainst the wayfarers face</s> he had already begun to fancy that he could distinguish in thesoughing of the wind and the creaking of the boughs unearthly criesand fiendish shouts of glee but as he approached the dreaded streamhis courage almost entirely failed him and it required a great effortto keep from turning his back to it and running away in the directionof the little village at the foot of parlick</s>  it struck him howeverthat he had come a long distance that if he did go back to the pattenarms the company would be dispersed and the inmates asleep and whatwas more effective than all that if he could only cross the bridge hewould be safe the greenies boggarts and feorin not having powerover any one who had passed over the water</s>  influenced by thisthought yet with his knees trembling under him he pushed forwardwith assumed boldness and he had almost reached the bridge when heheard the noise of passing feet in the crunching snow and becameconscious of the presence of a ghastly thing he was unable to see</s> suddenly a sepulchral howl brought him to a stop and with his heartthrobbing loudly enough to be heard he stood gazing fixedly into thedarkness</s>  there was nothing to be perceived however save the copingsof the bridge with their coverings of rime and he might have stoodthere until daylight had not another cry louder and even moreunearthly and horrible than the preceding one called him from histrance</s>  no sooner had this second scream died away than impelled byan irresistible impulse he stepped forward in the direction whencethe noise had come</s>  at this moment the moon burst forth from behindthe clouds which had for some time obscured her light and her raysfell upon the road with its halfhidden carttracks winding away intothe dim distance and in the very centre of the bridge he beheld ahideous figure with black shaggy hide and huge eyes closelyresembling orbs of fire</s> adam at once knew from the likeness the dread object bore to thefigure he had heard described by those who had seen the skriker thatthe terrible thing before him was an ambassador of death</s> without any consciousness of what he was doing and acting as thoughunder the sway of a strange and irresistible mesmeric influence hestepped towards the bridge but no sooner did he stir than thefrightful thing in front of him with a motion that was not walkingbut rather a sort of heavy gliding moved also slowly retreatingpausing when he paused and always keeping its fiery eyes fixed uponhis blanched face</s>  slowly he crossed the stream but gradually hissteps grew more and more rapid until he broke into a run</s>  suddenly afaint knowledge of the horrible nature of his position dawned uponhim</s>  a little cottage stood by the roadside and from one of itschamberwindows so near to the ground as to be within his reach adim light shone the room probably being occupied by a sick person orby watchers of the dead</s>  influenced by a sudden feeling ofcompanionship adam tried to cry out but his tongue clave to hisparched mouth and ere he could mumble a few inarticulate soundsscarcely audible to himself the dwelling was left far behind and asensation of utter loneliness and helplessness again took possessionof him</s> he had thus traversed more than a mile of the road in some parts ofwhich shaded by the high hedgerows and overhanging boughs the onlylight seemed to him to be that from the terrible eyes when suddenlyhe stumbled over a stone and fell</s>  in a second impressed by a fearthat the ghastly object would seize him he regained his feet and tohis intense relief the skriker was no longer visible</s>  with a sigh ofpleasure he sat down upon a heap of broken stones for his limbs nolonger forced into mechanical movement by the influence of thespectres presence refused to bear him further</s>  bitterly cold as wasthe night the perspiration stood in beads upon his whitened faceand with the recollection of the skrikers terrible eyes and horriblebody strong upon him he shook and shivered as though in a fit of theague</s>  a strong and burly man in the very prime of life he felt asweak as a girl and fearing that he was about to sink to the groundin a swoon he took handfuls of the crisp snow and rubbed them uponhis forehead</s>  under this sharp treatment he soon revived a littleand after several unsuccessful efforts he succeeded in regaining hisfeet and resumed his lonely journey</s> starting at the least sough of the breeze the faintest creak of abending branch or the fall of a piece of frozen rime from a bough heslowly trudged along</s> he had passed the quaint old house at chaigely the sudden yelp of achained dog in the courtyard giving him a thrill of horror as he wentby and he had reached the bend in that part of the road which isopposite the towering woodcovered kemple end</s>  a keen and cuttingblast swept through the black firs that crowned the summit and stoodlike solemn sentinels upon the declivity</s>  there was a music in thewind mournful as a croon over the corpse of a beautiful woman whosehair still shimmers with the golden light of life but adam heard nomelody in the moaning sighs which seemed to fill the air around</s>  tohim whose soul was yet under the influence of the terror throughwhich he had so recently passed the sounds assumed an awful naturewhilst the firs standing so clearly defined against the snow whichlay in virgin heaps upon the beds of withered fern seemed like somany weird skeletons shaking their bony arms in menace or in warning</s> with a suddenness that was more than startling there was a lull andthe breeze ceased even to whisper</s>  the silence was more painful thanwere the noises of the blast battling with the branches for it filledthe breast of the solitary wayfarer with forebodings of coming woe</s>  atthe point he had reached the road sank and as adam stepped into thealmost utter darkness caused by the high banks to which clung massesof decayed vegetation beautified by the genius of winter into whitefestoons again and again the terrible shriek rang out</s> there was no mistaking the voice of the skriker for that of anythingelse upon earth and with a sickly feeling at his heart adam slowlyemerged from the gloom and in expectation of the appearance of theghastly figure passed on</s>  he had not to wait long for as he reachedthe old bridge spanning the hodder once more he saw in the centreof the road about midway of the stream the same terrible object hehad followed along the lane from the brook at thornley</s> with a sensation of terror somewhat less intense than that which hadpreviously influenced him he again yielded to the power whichimpelled him forward and once more the strange procession commencedthe skriker gliding over the snow not however without a peculiarshuffling of its feet surrounded as they were by masses of longhair which clung to them and deadened the sound and adam followingin his mechanical and involuntary trot</s>  the journey this timehowever was of but short duration for the poor fellows cottage wasonly a little way from the river</s>  the distance was soon traversed andthe skriker with its face towards the terrified man took up itsposition against the door of the dwelling</s>  adam could not resist theattraction which drew him to the ghastly thing and as he neared itin a fit of wild desperation he struck at it but his hand bangedagainst the oak of the door and as the spectre splashed away hefell forward in a swoon</s> disturbed by the noise of the fall the goodwife arose and drew himinto the cottage but for some hours he was unable to tell the storyof his terrible journey</s>  when he had told of his involuntary chase ofthe skriker a deep gloom fell over the womans features for she wellknew what the ghastly visit portended to their little household</s>  thedread uncertainty did not continue long however for on the third dayfrom that upon which adam had reached his home the eldest lad wasbrought home drowned and after attending the childs funeral adamswife sickened of a fever and within a few weeks she too was carriedto mytton churchyard</s>  these things together with the dreadfulexperience of the journey from chipping so affected adam that he losthis reason and for years afterwards the sound of his patteringfootsteps as in harmless idiotcy with wild eyes and outstretchedhands he trotted along the roads in chase of an imaginary boggartfell with mournful impressiveness upon the ears of groups gathered byfarmhouse fires to listen to stories of the skriker</s> 1the unbidden guest</s> in a little lane leading from the town of clitheroe there once lived anoted cunning man to whom all sorts of applications were made notonly by the residents but also by people from distant places for thefame of the wizard had spread over the whole country side</s>  if a theftwas committed at once the services of owd jeremy were enlistedand as a result some one entirely innocent was if not accused atleast suspected while maidens and young men anxious to pry intofuturity and behold the faces of their unknown admirers paid himtrifling fees to enable them to gratify their curiosity</s>  in shortjeremy professed to be an able student of the black art on familiarspeaking terms with satan and duly qualified to foretell mensdestinies by the aid of the stars</s> the cottage in which the old man resided was of a mean order and itsoutward appearance was by no means likely to impress visitors with anidea that great pecuniary advantages had followed that personalacquaintance with the evil one of which the wizard boasted</s>  ifhowever the outside was mean and shabby the inside of the dwellingwas of a nature better calculated to inspire inquirers with feelingsof awe hung round as the one chamber was with faded and motheatenblack cloth upon which grotesque astrological designs and the figureof a huge dragon were worked in flaming red</s>  the window being hiddenby the dingy tapestry the only light in the room came from astarvedlooking candle which was fixed in the foot of the skeleton ofa child attached to a string from the ceiling and dangling just overthe table where a ponderous volume lay open before a large crystalglobe and two skulls</s> in an oldfashioned chair above which hung suspended a dirty anddilapidated crocodile the wizard sat and gave audience to the strayvisitors whose desire to peer into futurity overmastered the fear withwhich the lonely cottage was regarded</s>  a quaintlooking old man wasjeremy with his hungrylooking eyes and long white beard and aswith bony fingers he turned over the leaves of the large book therewas much in his appearance likely to give the superstitious andignorant customers overwhelming ideas of his wondrous wisdom</s>  themake up was creditable to jeremy for though he succeeded indeceiving others with his assumption of supernatural knowledge hehimself did not believe in those powers whose aid he so frequentlyprofessed to invoke on behalf of his clients</s> one day when the ragged cloth had fallen behind a victim who wasdeparting from the wizards sanctum with a few vague and mysterioushints in exchange for solid coin the old man after laughingsarcastically pulled aside the dingy curtains and stepped to thecasement through which the glorious sunlight was streaming</s>  the sceneupon which the wizard looked was a very beautiful one and the old manleaned his head upon his hands and gazed intently upon the landscape</s> tis a bonnie world said hetis a bonnie world and there arefew views in it to compare with this one for beauty</s>  my soul is drawntoward old pendle yon with a love passing that of woman heartlessand passionless though the huge mass be</s>  heartless</s>  said he after apauseheartless</s>  when every minute there is a fresh expression uponits beautiful front</s>  ay even so for it looms yonder calm andunconcerned when we are ushered into the world and when we areushered out of it and laid to moulder away under the mountainsshadow and it will rear its bold bluffs to heaven and smile in thesunlight or frown in the gloom after we who now love to gaze upon itare blind to the solemn loveliness of its impassable face</s>  poorperishable fools are we with less power than the breeze which rufflesyon purple heather</s> with a heavy sigh jeremy turned away from the window and as thecurtain fell behind him and he stood again in the wretchedlylightedroom he saw that he was not alone</s>  the chair in which the tremblinghinds generally were asked to seat themselves held a strangelookingvisitor of dark and forbidding aspect</s> jeremiah said this personage devildom first and poetisingafterwards</s> there was an unpleasant tone of banter in this speech which did notseem in keeping with the character of one who fain would pry intofuturity and as the wizard took his usual position beneath thecrocodile he looked somewhat less oracular than was his wont when infront of a shivering and terrified inquirer</s> what wantest thou with me</s>  said he with an illassumed appearanceof unconcern</s> the occupant of the chair smiled sardonically as he replieda little securitythats all</s>  for fiveandtwenty years thou hastbeen amassing wealth by duping credulous fools and it is time i hadmy percentage</s> the wizard stared in astonishment</s>  was the stranger a thief or worse</s> he wondered but after a time however he said drilyeven if thou hadst proved thy right to a portion of the profits of myhonest

furniture and its tenant a halfstarved old man who hashad hard work to support life upon the pittance he receives in returnfor priceless words of wisdom</s>  thou art a stranger to me and thyportion

willingness to help thee and now trueto thy beggarly instincts thou wouldst deny me</s>  but twill be invain jeremiahtwill be in vain</s>  i have postponed this visit toolong already to be put off with subterfuges now</s> i repeat i know thee not said the wizard in a trembling voice</s> and hurriedly rising from his chair he flung aside the thickcurtain in order that the light of day might stream into the chamberfor a nameless fear had taken possession of him and he did not careto remain in the darkened apartment with his suspicious visitor</s>  tohis surprise and terror however darkness had fallen upon the sceneand as he gazed in alarm at the little diamondframed windowthrough which so short a time before he had looked upon a fairprospect of meadow and mountain a vivid flash of lightning dartedacross the heavens and a clap of thunder burst over the cottage</s> twill spoil good mens harvests jeremiah the stranger calmlysaid but it need not interrupt our interesting

cloven foot</s> with a groan the wizard sank into his chair and deaf to the roaringof the thunder and to the beating of the rain through the doorway hesat helplessly gazing at his guest whose metallic laughter rangthrough the room</s> hast thou at length recognised me jeremiah</s>  asked the evil oneafter an interval during which he had somewhat prominently displayedthe hoof and gloated over the

as he placed a parchment upon the table</s> what security dost thou demand</s>  feebly inquired the quaking wizard</s> personal only said satan</s>  put thy name to this and he pointed tothe bond</s> jeremy pushed his chair as far from the suspiciouslooking document ashe could ere he repliedthou shalt not have name of mine</s> he had expected that an outburst of fiendish wrath would follow

the rightful trade of my faithful servants longenough and tis time i stopped thy prosperous career</s>  ere sunsetthou shalt have a rival who will take the bread from thy ungratefulmouth</s> after this polite speech the visitor picked up the parchment andbegan to fold it in a methodical manner</s> such utterly unexpected gentlemanly behaviour somewhat reassuredjeremiah and in a fainter voice he humbly asked what his visitor hadto give in exchange for a wizards autograph</s> twentytwo years of such success as thou hast not even dared to dreamof</s>  no oppositionno exposure to thy miserable dupes readilyanswered satan</s> jeremiah considered deeply</s>  the offer undoubtedly was a tempting onefor after all his profession had not been very lucrative and to losehis customers therefore meant starvation</s>  he was certain that ifanother wizard opened an establishment the people would flock to himeven through mere curiosity but he knew what signing the bondincluded and he was afraid to take the step</s> after a long delay during which satan carefully removed a sharpstone from his hoof jeremiah therefore firmly saidmaster ill not sign</s> without more ado the visitor departed and almost before he was out ofsight the storm abated and old pendle again became visible</s> a few days passed and no one came to the dwelling of the wizard andas such an absence of customers was very unusual jeremy began to fearthat the supernatural stranger had not forgotten his threat</s>  on theevening of the fifth day he crept into the little town to purchasesome articles of food</s>  previously whenever he had had occasion tomake a similar journey as he passed along the street the children ranaway in terror and the older people addressed him with remarkablehumility but this time as he stepped rapidly past the houses theyoungsters went on with their games as though only an ordinary mortalwent by and a burly fellow who was leaning against a door jamb tookhis pipe from his mouth to cry familiarlywell jerry owd lad heaw are ta</s> these marks of waning power and fading popularity were sufficientlyunmistakable but as he was making his few purchases he was informedthat a stranger who seemed to be possessed of miraculous powers hadarrived in the town and that many people who had been to him weregoing about testifying to his wonderful skill</s>  with a heavy heart thewizard returned to his cottage</s>  next night a shower of stones dashedhis window to pieces and as he peered into the moonlight lane hesaw a number of rough fellows who evidently were waiting and watchingin hopes that he would emerge from his dwelling</s>  these were the onlyvisitors he had during an entire week and at length quite preparedto capitulate he said to himselfi wish i had another

kept perfectlysilent and in a little while the figure paused and turned round asthough in expectation continuing however its mournful notes</s> byandby the voices of other singers were distinguished

alittle village near garstang a poor idiot named gregory</s>  he was atonce the sport and the terror of the young folks</s>  uniformly kind tothem carefully convoying them to the spots where in his lonelyrambles he had noticed birds nests or pressing upon them the wildflowers he had gathered in the neighbouring woods and thickets hereceived at their ungrateful hands all kinds of ill treatment notalways stopping short of personal violence</s>  in this respect howeverthe thoughtless children only followed the example set them by theirelders for seldom did poor gregory pass along the row of cottagesdignified by the name of street which constituted the villagewithout an unhandsome head being projected from the blacksmiths orcobblers shop or from a doorway and a cruel taunt being sent afterthe idiot who in his ragged clothing with his handful of harebellsand primroses and a wreath of green leaves round his battered oldhat jogged along towards his mothers cottage singing as he went ina pathetic monotone a snatch of an old lancashire ballad</s> in accordance with that holy law which under such circumstancesinfluences womans heart the mother loved this demented lad withpassionate fondness all the tenderness with which her nature had beenendowed having been called forth by the needs of the afflicted childwhose only haven of refuge from the harshness of his surroundings andthe cruelty of those who had not they been as ignorant as the hogsthey fed would have pitied and protected him was her breast</s> lavishing all her affection upon the poor lad she had no kindness tospare for those who tormented him and abstaining from any of thosemelodramatic and vulgar curses with which a person of less educationwould have followed those who abused her child she studiously heldherself aloof from her neighbours and avoided meeting them exceptwhen she was compelled to purchase food or other articles for herlittle household</s>  this conduct gave an excuse for much illfeeling and as the woman had no need to toil for her daily bread andas her cottage was the neatest in the district there was muchjealousy</s> one night at a jovial gathering it was arranged that a practicaljoke of what was considered a very humorous kind should be playedupon the idiot</s>  the boors selected one of their party whose task itshould be to attire himself in a white sheet and to emerge into thelane when the poor lad should make his appearance</s>  in accordance withthis plan the pack of hobbledehoys watched the cottage night afternight in the hope of seeing the idiot leave the dwelling and atlength their patience was rewarded</s>  they immediately hid themselves inthe ditch while the mock ghost concealed himself behind the trunk ofa tree</s>  the lad not suspecting any evil came along humming in hismelancholy monotone the usual fragment and just before he reachedthe tree the sheeted figure slowly stepped forth to the accompanimentof the groanings and bellowings of his associates</s>  they had expectedto see the idiot flee in terror but instead of so doing he laughedloudly at the white figure and then suddenly as the expression ofhis face changed to one of intense interest he shouted oh oh</s>  ablack one</s>  a black one</s>  sure enough a dark and terrible figure stoodin the middle of the road</s>  the mock ghost fled with his companions athis heels the real spectre chasing them hotly and the idiot bringingup the rear shouting at the top of his voice run black devil</s> catch white devil</s> they were not long in reaching the village down the street of whichthey ran faster than they ever had run before</s>  several of them dartedinto the smithy where the blacksmith was scattering the sparks rightand left as he hammered away at the witchresisting horseshoes andothers fled into the inn where they startled the gathered company ofidle gossips but the mock ghost kept on wildly looking neither tothe left nor to the right</s>  the idiot had kept close behind the phantomat the heels of the mock ghost and when at the end of the village thespectre vanished as suddenly as it had appeared the lad ran a littlefaster and took its place</s>  of this however the whitesheeted youngfellow was not aware and fearing every moment that the shadow wouldcatch him in its awful embrace he dashed down a by lane</s>  before hegot very far however the idiot who had gradually been lessening thedistance between them overtook and seized him by the neck</s>  with aterrible cry the rustic fell headlong into the ditch dragging gregorywith him as he fell</s>  the latter was soon upon his feet and dancingabout the lane as he cried catch white devil</s>  catch white devil</s> the mock ghost however lay quiet enough among the nettles</s> roused by the story told by the affrighted ones who had rushed sounceremoniously into their presence as well as by the startling cryof run black devil</s>  catch white devil</s>  which the idiot had shoutedas he sped past the door several of the topers emerged from theirabiding place and as nothing could be seen of either mock ghostspectre or idiot they bravely determined to go in search of them</s>  asthey passed along the road from the village their attention wasattracted by the cries which seemed to come from the lonely lane andsomewhat nervously making their way along it they soon saw the idiotdancing about the side of the ditch</s>  with a sudden access of couragedue to the presence of anything human however weak they hurriedalong and as they drew nearer the idiot paused in his gambols andpointed to the mock ghost who lay stretched in the shadow of thehedgerow</s>  he was soon carried away to the village where he lay illfor weeks</s> the kindness of gregorys mother to the sick lads parents who werevery poor and could ill afford to provide the necessary comforts hiscondition required caused public feeling to turn in her favour andthose who formerly had been loudest in defaming her became her warmesteulogists</s>  between the idiot and the young fellow too a strangefriendship sprang up and the pair might often be seen passing alongthe lanes the idiot chanting his melancholy fragments to thecompanion whose cap he had adorned with wreaths of wild flowers</s> with such a protector the idiot was quite safe and indeed had thevillage children been wishful to torment gregory if the presence ofthis companion had not sufficed to restrain them they had only toremember that it was in defence of poor gregory the evil one himselfhad raced through the village</s> 11the enchanted fisherman</s> there are few views in the north of england more beautiful than thatwhich is seen from morecambe as the spectator looks over thebeautiful bay with its crescent coastline of nearly fifty miles inextent</s>  at low water the dazzling sands streaked by silvery deceptivechannels stretch to the distant glimmering sea the music of whoseheavings comes but faintly on the gentle breeze but at tidetime amagnificent expanse of rolling waves sweeps away to peel and isdotted over with redsailed fishing boats and coasters</s>  far to thenorth the huge heathercovered furness fells stand sentinellike overthe waters and above them dimly seen through the faint blue hazetower the grand mountains of the magic lake country</s>  the scene is fullof a sweet dreamlike beauty but there are times when the beautifulis swallowed in the majestic as the mists come creeping over the seaobscuring the coasts and hiding everything save the white caps of thewaves gleaming in the darkness through which the muttering diapasonsof the wind as though in deep distress sound mysteriously or whenin winter the moon is hidden by scudding clouds and the hugerollers driven before the breeze dash themselves to death as uponthe blast come the solemn boom of a signal gun and the faint cries ofthose in danger on the deep</s> years ago however before the little village of poulton changed itsname and began to dream of becoming a wateringplace with terracesand hotels instead of the picturesque tumbledown huts of thefishermen against which from time immemorial the spray had beendashed by the salt breezes the only people who gazed upon the lovelyprospect were with the exception of an occasional traveller thefamilies of the toilers of the sea and the roughlooking menthemselves</s>  these hardy fellows accustomed to a wild life and whosedays from childhood had been spent on or by the sea loved the deepwith as much tenderness as a strong man feels towards a weak andwayward maiden for they were familiar with its every mood with thesoothing wash of its wavelets when the sunbeams kissed the foambellsas they died on the white sands and with the noise of the thunder ofthe breakers chased up the beach by the roaring gales</s> one evening a number of these men were seated in the cosy kitchen ofthe johnogaunt listening to owd england as he narrated some ofhis strange

night was perfectly calm the moon shining faintly through a thinmist which rested on the face of the deep</s>  it was nearly midnight androger was thinking of making for home when he heard the sweet soundsof a peal of bells</s>  not without astonishment he endeavoured toascertain from what quarter the noises came and strange and unlikelyas it seemed it appeared that the chimes rang up through the waterupon which with dreamy motion his boat was gliding</s>  bending over theside of the skiff he again heard with singular distinctness the musicof the bells pealing in weird beauty</s>  for some time he remained inthis attitude intently listening to the magical music and when hearose the mist had cleared off and the moon was throwing her lovelylight upon the waters and over the distant fells</s>  instead howeverof beholding a coast with every inch of which he was acquainted rogergazed upon a district of which he knew nothing</s>  there were mountainsbut they were not those whose

trees</s>  the estuary into which his boat wasgliding was not that of the kent with its ash and oakcovered crags</s> everything seemed unreal even the streaming moonlight having anunusual whiteness and roger rapidly hoisted his little sails butthey only flapped idly against the mast as the boat in obedience toan invisible and unknown agency drifted along the mysterious lookingriver</s>  as the fisherman gazed in helpless wonder gradually the waternarrowed and in a short time a cove was gained the boat grating uponthe gleaming sand</s>  roger at once jumped upon the bank and no soonerhad he

though anxious to lead himfrom the water</s> assuming that he had come upon a colony of greenies and feelingassured that such tiny beings could not injure him even if anxious todo so roger walked on with his conductor the band dancing in aprogressing circle in front of them until a wood was reached whenthe dancers broke up the ring and advanced in single file between thetrees</s>  the light grew more and more dim and when the cavalcadereached the entrance to a cavern roger could hardly discern thegreenies</s>  clinging to the little hand of his guide however theundaunted fisherman entered the cave and groped his way down a flightof mossy steps</s>  suddenly he found himself in a beautiful glade inwhich hundreds of little figures closely resembling his escort andwearing dainty red caps were disporting themselves and singing moonbeams kissing odorous bowers light our home amid the flowers while our beauteous king and queen watch us dance on rings of green</s>  rings of green rings of green dance dance dance on rings of green</s> no sooner had the fisherman entered the glade than the whole partycrowded round him but as they did so a strain of enchanting music washeard and the little beings hopped away again and whirled round in afantastic waltz</s>  roger himself was so powerfully influenced by themelody that he flung himself into the midst of the dancers whowelcomed him with musical cries and he capered about until sheerfatigue forced him to sink to rest upon a flowery bank</s>  here afterwatching for a while the graceful gambols of the greenies and soothedby the weird music the sensuous odours and the dreamy light he fellinto a deep sleep</s>  when he awoke from his slumber the fairies hadvanished and the fisherman felt very hungry</s>  no sooner however hadhe wished for something to eat than on the ground before him thereappeared a goodly array of delicacies of which without more adoroger partook</s> im in lucks way here he said to himself its not

appeared before him</s> i wish i could get money at this rate said the fisherman and thewords had hardly left his lips when piles of gold ranged themselveswithin his reach</s>  roger rapidly filled his pockets with the glitteringcoins and even took the shoes from off his feet and filled themalso and then slung them round his neck by the strings</s> now if i could but get to my boat thought he my

coquettishly stuck for this personage he suspected wasthe king and forgetting his desire to escape with the gold and atonce yielding to his feelings he flung himself on the luxuriant grassnear the little being whose weird loveliness had thrown so strange aglamour over him and without any thought or fear as to theconsequences he at once bent himself and kissed one of her daintysandalled feet</s>  no sooner had he performed this rash act of devotionthan numberless blows fell upon him from all sides but he was unableto see any of the beings by whom he was struck</s>  instinctively thefisherman

camesuddenly upon him at a turn of the road</s>  never stopping even for aminute to gaze through the panes whence streamed the ruddy glow of thewood fires and to envy the dwellers in the cosy cottages

blinding snow into heaps upon thewindowsills and against the cottage doors and darkness and stormspread their sombre wings over the coast then was it certain that themysterious being would be seen for observation had taught thevillagers and the dwellers in solitary houses along the lonely roadsbetween the fishing hamlets that in storm and darkness the weirdvoyager was most likely to appear</s> at

of the place and its dreadsurroundings</s> suddenly she uttered a shrill shriek for she heard a hissing whisperat her ear and felt an icy breath upon her cheek</s>  she dared not turnround for she saw

mechanicallyjerked the bellrope and the poor woman was fast losing her senseswhen suddenly the door was burst open and a couple of villagers whohad been alarmed by the irregular ringing entered the tower</s>  they atonce started back as they saw the strange groupthe wanderer withsad inquiring look and pallid face the phantom hare with itsfirelit eyes and the old ringer standing as though in a trance</s>  nosooner however did one of the intruders gaze at the animal than itslipped out of sight down into the pocket of its companion and keeperand the wanderer himself hastily glided between the astonished menand out into the darkness of the graveyard</s> on many other gloomy nights afterwards the ringer was accosted in thesame manner but although the unnatural being and the spectral

neverrestingman had been doomed to expiate by so lonely and lasting a pilgrimage</s> whence he came and whither he went remained unknown but long as hecontinued to patrol the coast the hollow sound of his hasty footstepsnever lost its terror to the cottagers and even after years hadpassed over without the usual visits allusions to the weird pilgrimand his dread companion failed not to cause a

gift</s> many are the wells in lancashire that once were supposed to be thehomes of good or evil spiritsof demons or of beneficentfairiesand despite the injunctions of the church against thecustoms of praying at and waking wells down to a comparatively recentperiod they were resorted to by pilgrims of all grades who were insearch of health</s>  one such spring near blackpool known as thefairies well had its daily crowds of the ailing and the sorrowfulfor its water was credited with virtues as wonderful as they weremanifold and from far and near people brought vessels to be filledwith the miraculous fluid</s> one day at noon a poor woman who had journeyed many a weary mile inorder to obtain a supply of the water with which to bathe the eyes ofher child whose sight was fast failing and upon whom all the usualremedies had been tried without success on rising from her knees atthe well side was surprised to find standing near her a handsomelittle man clad in green who certainly was not in sight when she bentto fill her bottle</s>
 as she stood gazing at the dainty object thevisitor without having previously asked her any questions handed toher a beautiful box filled with ointment and directed her to applythe salve to the eyes of her child whose sight it would restore</s> surprised beyond measure at the little mans knowledge of her familyaffairs the woman mechanically accepted the gift but when aftercarefully placing the box in her pocket she turned to thank thegiver he was no longer to be seen and satisfied that she had had aninterview with one of the beings after whom the well was named shestarted on her journey to her distant home</s> the strangeness of the present given as she trusted it was by a fairywho was conversant with the painful circumstances under which she hadmade her pilgrimage caused her to hope that the ointment would proveefficacious in removing the disorder under which her child waslabouring but this vague feeling based as it was upon the mysteriousnature of the gift was accompanied by a perfectly natural fear thatafter all the giver might have been one of those mischievous beingswhose delight it was to wreak harm and wrong upon humanity</s> when she reached home and told the strange story to her wonderinghusband the nervous pair decided that the ointment should not be usedunless a further mark of fairy interest in the childs welfare werevouchsafed to them but when a few days had passed and the childcontinued to grow worse the anxious mother in the absence of herhusband determined to test the salve upon one of her own eyes</s>  shedid so and after a few minutes of dreadful suspense finding thatevil results did not follow and saying to herself that surely thefairy could not be desirous of harming her child she anointed thelittle girls eyes</s>  she refrained however from making her helpmateacquainted with what she had done until in the course of a few daysthe childs eyesight was so nearly restored that it was no longernecessary or possible to keep the matter from

passedand as the girl had never had a relapse thestrange gift was almost forgottenwhen one day in the marketplaceat preston the woman who was haggling about the price of a load ofpotatoes saw before

lamentationcalculated to terrify save the consciousness that such sweet musiccould not be that of a mortal</s>  instinctively giles looked in thedirection whence the sound had come and in the dim

undulating summit of the fellwhere the wind was sighing over the manyflowered heather but therewas nothing to be seen of the blueeyed phantom and only for thefaint wash of the rustling ferns all would have been silent</s> unwilling to leave the spot although he was conscious that the taskwas a fruitless one he continued to wander from one point to anotherand it was not until daybreak that he

village street and vanishedinto the darkness of a lonely lane gave rise to cruel rumours that hewas a professor of the black art and it was even whispered that hisnight walks were pilgrimages to unholy scenes of satanic revelry</s> these suspicions deepened almost into certainty when the old peoplewho had charge of his house informed the gossips that the contents ofa large package since the

the lake was awakened from his sleep by anexceedingly shrill and terrible shriek which seemed to come from theopposite shore</s>  the wind was whistling and moaning round the houseand for a little while the ferryman and his family fancied that thecry by which they had been disturbed was nothing more than one of themournful voices of the storm but soon again came another shriek evenmore aweinspiring than the former one and this was followed bysmothered shouts and groans of a most unearthly nature</s> against the wishes of his terrified relatives who clung to him andbesought him to remain indoors the old fellow bravely determined tocross the water and heeding not the prayers of his wife and daughterhe unfastened his boat and rowed away</s>  the two women clasped in eachothers

the terrible cry rang out through the gloom and shrieks andmoans were heard loud above the mysterious noises of the night</s> in a state of dreadful suspense and terror the women stood for sometime but at length they saw the boat suddenly emerge from thedarkness and shoot into the little cove</s>  to their great surprisehowever the ferryman who could be seen sitting alone made no effortto land and make his way to the cottage so fearing that somethingdreadful had happened to him and impelled by love they rushed tothe side of the lake</s>  they found the old man speechless his face aswhite and blanched as the snow upon the nab and his whole bodytrembling under the influence of terror and they immediately led himto the cottage but though appealed to to say what terrible objecthe had seen he made no other response than an occasional subduedmoan</s>  for several days he remained in that state deaf to theirpiteous entreaties and staring at them with wildlooking eyes but atlength the end came and during the gloaming of a beautiful day hedied without having revealed to those around him what he had seenwhen in answer to the midnight cry he had rowed the ferryboatacross the stormruffled

heard the first shriekring through the cottage than they were smitten with terror</s> profiting however by the experience of their predecessor andinfluenced by fear they did not make any attempt to cross the lakeand the cries continued until some time after midnight</s> afterwards whenever the day closed gloomily and ushered in a stormynight and the wind lashed the water of the lake into fury

notdare to cross the haunted water save in the broad daylight of summer</s> it therefore struck the two individuals who were most concerned in themaintenance of the ferry that if they intended to live they must dosomething to rid the place of its bad name and of the unseen beingwho had driven away all their patrons</s>  in their extremity they askedeach other who should help them if not the holy

spectralcrier which had reached the distant abbey long before the ferrymansvisit were a pack of falsehoods when about midnight he suddenlyjumped from the chair upon which he was dozing by the wood

the open air and hurried to the lakethe men following at a respectful distance</s>  the whiterobed father wasthe first to get into the boat and the ferrymen hoped that heintended to go alone but he called upon them to propel the boat tothe middle of the lake and much as they disliked the task as it wason their behalf that the monk was about to combat the evil spiritthey could not well refuse to accompany him</s> when they were about halfway across the lake the wind suddenlylulled and once more they heard the awful scream and this time itsounded as though the crier was quite close to them</s>  the occupants ofthe boat were terribly frightened and one of them after suddenlyshrieking hes here fainted and lay still at the bottom of theboat while the monk and the other man stared straight before them asthough petrified</s> there was a fourth person present a grim and ghastly figure with thetrappings of this life still dangling about its withered and shrunkenlimbs and a gaping wound in its pallid throat</s>  for a few minutesthere was a dead silence but at last it was broken by the monk whorapidly muttered a prayer for protection against evil spirits andthen took a bottle from a pocket of his robe and sprinkled a fewdrops of holy water upon himself and the ferryman who remained in thesame statuesque attitude and upon the unconscious occupant of thebottom of the boat</s>  after this ceremony he opened a little book andin a sonorous voice intoned the form for the exorcism of a wanderingsoul concluding with vade ad gehennam</s>  when to the infinite reliefof the ferryman

that he mourned the lossof a relative or friend and he had not been long at the tower beforeit began to be whispered in the servantshall that the trappings andthe suits of woe were worn in memory of a girl who had been false tohim and who had died soon after her marriage to his rival</s>  this storyin itself was sufficient to throw a halo of romance around the youngvisitor but when it was rumoured that domestics who had beenreturning to the tower late at night had seen strangecoloured lightsburning in edgars room and that even at daybreak the early risershad seen the lights still unextinguished and the shadow of thewatcher pass across the curtains an element of fear mingled with thefeelings with which he was regarded</s> there was much in the visitor calculated to deepen the impressions bywhich the superstitious domestics were influenced for surrounded byan atmosphere of gloom out of which he seemed to start when any ofthem addressed him and appearing studiously to shun all the societywhich it was possible for him to avoid he spent most of his timealone seated beneath the spreading branches of the giant oak tree atthe end of the garden reading blackletter volumes and plunged inmeditation</s>  not that he was in any way rude to his hosts on thecontrary he was almost chivalrous in his attention to the youngermembers of the family and to the ladies of the house who in theirturn regarded him with affectionate pity and did their utmost towean him from his lonely pursuits</s>  yet although he would willinglyaccompany them through the woods or to the distant town the approachof the gloaming invariably found him in his usual place beneath theshadow of the gnarled old boughs either poring over his favouritebooks or with eyes fixed upon vacancy lost in a reverie</s> time would the kind people thought bring balm to his wounds and inthe meanwhile they were glad to have their griefstricken friend withthem and fully appreciating their sympathy edgar came and went aboutthe place and grounds just as the whim of the moment took him</s>  thisabsence of curiosity on the part of the members of the family washowever amply compensated for by the open wonder with which many ofthe domestics regarded the young stranger and before he had been manymonths in the house his nightly vigils were the theme of many aserious conversation in the kitchen where in front of a cosy

at the hour of twelve creep to the door of thevisitors chamber and endeavour to discover what was the nature ofthose pursuits which rendered lights necessary during the whole of thenight</s>  the selection was soon made and after a little demur thechosen one agreed to perform the unpleasant task</s> at midnight therefore the trembling ambassador made his way to thedistant door and after a little hesitation natural enough under thecircumstances he stooped and gazed through a hole in the dried oakwhence a knot had fallen</s>  edgar astley was seated at a little tablean old blacklooking

student did not permit him to leave thechamber through the little window of which the dawn was streamingbefore he had sworn that not a word as to anything he had seen orheard should pass his lips</s>  the solemnity of the vow was deepened bythe mysterious and awful threats with which it was accompanied andthe servant therefore loudly protested to his fellows that he hadnot seen or heard anything
