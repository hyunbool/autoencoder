 to a man ofhis temperament and upbringing even a simple railway journey was crammedwith petty annoyances and minor discords and as he settled himself downin a secondclass compartment one september morning he was conscious ofruffled feelings and general mental discomposure</s>  he had been staying ata country vicarage the inmates of which had been certainly neitherbrutal nor bacchanalian but their supervision of the domesticestablishment had been of that lax order which invites disaster</s>  thepony carriage that was to take him to the station had never been properlyordered and when the moment for his departure drew near the handymanwho should have produced the required article was nowhere to be found</s> in this emergency theodoric to his mute but very intense disgust foundhimself obliged to collaborate with the vicars daughter in the task ofharnessing the pony which necessitated groping about in an illlightedouthouse called a stable and smelling very like oneexcept in patcheswhere it smelt of mice</s>  without being actually afraid of mice theodoricclassed them among the coarser incidents of life and considered thatprovidence with a little exercise of moral courage might long ago haverecognised that they were not indispensable and have withdrawn them fromcirculation</s>  as the train glided out of the station theodorics nervousimagination accused himself of exhaling a weak odour of stableyard andpossibly of displaying a mouldy straw or two on his usually wellbrushedgarments</s>  fortunately the only other occupant of the compartment a ladyof about the same age as himself seemed inclined for slumber rather thanscrutiny the train was not due to stop till the terminus was reached inabout an hours time and the carriage was of the oldfashioned sortthat held no communication with a corridor therefore no furthertravelling companions were likely to intrude on theodorics semiprivacy</s> and yet the train had scarcely attained its normal speed before he becamereluctantly but vividly aware that he was not alone with the slumberinglady he was not even alone in his own clothes</s>  a warm creepingmovement over his flesh betrayed the unwelcome and highly resentedpresence unseen but poignant of a strayed mouse that had evidentlydashed into its present retreat during the episode of the ponyharnessing</s>  furtive stamps and shakes and wildly directed pinches failedto dislodge the intruder whose motto indeed seemed to be excelsiorand the lawful occupant of the clothes lay back against the cushions andendeavoured rapidly to evolve some means for putting an end to the dualownership</s>  it was unthinkable that he should continue for the space of awhole hour in the horrible position of a rowton house for vagrant micealready his imagination had at least doubled the numbers of the alieninvasion</s>  on the other hand nothing less drastic than partialdisrobing would ease him of his tormentor and to undress in the presenceof a lady even for so laudable a purpose was an idea that made hiseartips tingle in a blush of abject shame</s>  he had never been able tobring himself even to the mild exposure of openwork socks in thepresence of the fair sex</s>  and yetthe lady in this case was to allappearances soundly and securely asleep the mouse on the other handseemed to be trying to crowd a wanderjahr into a few strenuous minutes</s> if there is any truth in the theory of transmigration this particularmouse must certainly have been in a former state a member of the alpineclub</s>  sometimes in its eagerness it lost its footing and slipped forhalf an inch or so and then in fright or more probably temper it bit</s> theodoric was goaded into the most audacious undertaking of his life</s> crimsoning to the hue of a beetroot and keeping an agonised watch on hisslumbering fellowtraveller he swiftly and noiselessly secured the endsof his railwayrug to the racks on either side of the carriage so that asubstantial curtain hung athwart the compartment</s>  in the narrowdressingroom that he had thus improvised he proceeded with violent hasteto extricate himself partially and the mouse entirely from thesurrounding casings of tweed and halfwool</s>  as the unravelled mouse gavea wild leap to the floor the rug slipping its fastening at either endalso came down with a heartcurdling flop and almost simultaneously theawakened sleeper opened her eyes</s>  with a movement almost quicker thanthe mouses theodoric pounced on the rug and hauled its ample foldschinhigh over his dismantled person as he collapsed into the furthercorner of the carriage</s>  the blood raced and beat in the veins of hisneck and forehead while he waited dumbly for the communicationcord tobe pulled</s>  the lady however contented herself with a silent stare ather strangely muffled companion</s>  how much had she seen theodoricqueried to himself and in any case what on earth must she think of hispresent posture</s> i think i have caught a chill he ventured desperately</s> really im sorry she replied</s>  i was just going to ask you if youwould open this window</s> i fancy its malaria he added his teeth chattering slightly as muchfrom fright as from a desire to support his theory</s> ive got some brandy in my holdall if youll kindly reach it down forme said his companion</s> not for worldsi mean i never take anything for it he assured herearnestly</s> i suppose you caught it in the tropics</s> theodoric whose acquaintance with the tropics was limited to an annualpresent of a chest of tea from an uncle in ceylon felt that even themalaria was slipping from him</s>  would it be possible he wondered todisclose the real state of affairs to her in small instalments</s> are you afraid of mice</s>  he ventured growing if possible more scarletin the face</s> not unless they came in quantities like those that ate up bishop hatto</s> why do you ask</s> i had one crawling inside my clothes just now said theodoric in avoice that hardly seemed his own</s>  it was a most awkward situation</s> it must have been if you wear your clothes at all tight she observedbut mice have strange ideas of comfort</s> i had to get rid of it while you were asleep he continued then witha gulp he added it was getting rid of it that brought me toto this</s> surely leaving off one small mouse wouldnt bring on a chill sheexclaimed with a levity that theodoric accounted abominable</s> evidently she had detected something of his predicament and was enjoyinghis confusion</s>  all the blood in his body seemed to have mobilised in oneconcentrated blush and an agony of abasement worse than a myriad micecrept up and down over his soul</s>  and then as reflection began to assertitself sheer terror took the place of humiliation</s>  with every minutethat passed the train was rushing nearer to the crowded and bustlingterminus where dozens of prying eyes would be exchanged for the oneparalysing pair that watched him from the further corner of the carriage</s> there was one slender despairing chance which the next few minutes mustdecide</s>  his fellowtraveller might relapse into a blessed slumber</s>  butas the minutes throbbed by that chance ebbed away</s>  the furtive glancewhich theodoric stole at her from time to time disclosed only anunwinking wakefulness</s> i think we must be getting near now she presently observed</s> theodoric had already noted with growing terror the recurring stacks ofsmall ugly dwellings that heralded the journeys end</s>  the words actedas a signal</s>  like a hunted beast breaking cover and dashing madlytowards some other haven of momentary safety he threw aside his rug andstruggled frantically into his dishevelled garments</s>  he was conscious ofdull surburban stations racing past the window of a choking hammeringsensation in his throat and heart and of an icy silence in that cornertowards which he dared not look</s>  then as he sank back in his seatclothed and almost delirious the train slowed down to a final crawl andthe woman spoke</s> would you be so kind she asked as to get me a porter to put me intoa cab</s>  its a shame to trouble you when youre feeling unwell but beingblind makes one so helpless at a railway station</s>       printed by     morrison  gibb limited      edinburgh</s>
