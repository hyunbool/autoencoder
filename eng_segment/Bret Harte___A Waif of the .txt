 it seemed to have already crumbled awaya part of the distance with its eating fires</s>  as it sank still lowerit shot out long luminous rays diverging fanlike across the plainas if in the boys

anhour and with the withdrawal of that mystic sunset glory objects becameeven more distinct and sharply defined than at any other time</s>  and withthe merciful sheathing of that flaming sword which seemed to have swayedbetween him and the vanished train his eyes already felt a blessedrelief</s>

 at times he thought heheard the halloaing of distant voices at times it seemed as a whisperin his own ear</s>  in the silence that followed each blast he fancied hecould detect the creaking of the wagon the dull thud of the oxenshoofs or broken fragments of speech blown and scattered even as hestrained his ears to listen by the next gust</s>  this tension of the earbegan to confuse his brain as his eyes had been previously dazzled bythe sunlight and a strange torpor began to steal over his faculties</s> once or twice his head dropped</s> he awoke with a start</s>  a moving figure had suddenly uplifted itselfbetween him and the horizon</s>  it was not twenty yards away so clearlyoutlined against the still luminous sky that it seemed even nearer</s> a human figure but so disheveled so fantastic and yet so mean andpuerile in its extravagance that it seemed the outcome of a childishdream</s>  it was a mounted figure but so ludicrously disproportionate tothe pony it bestrode whose slim legs were stiffly buried in the dust ina breathless halt that it might have been a straggler from some vulgarwandering circus</s>  a tall hat crownless and rimless a castaway ofcivilization surmounted by a turkeys feather was on its head overits shoulders hung a dirty tattered blanket that scarcely covered thetwo painted legs which seemed clothed in soiled yellow hose</s>  in one handit held a gun the other was bent above its eyes in eager scrutiny ofsome distant point beyond and east of the spot where the children layconcealed</s>  presently with a dozen quick noiseless strides of the ponyslegs the apparition moved to the right its gaze still fixed on thatmysterious part of the horizon</s>  there was no mistaking it now</s>  thepainted hebraic face the large curved nose the bony cheek the broadmouth the shadowed eyes the straight long matted locks</s>  it was anindian</s>  not the picturesque creature of clarences imagination butstill an indian</s>  the boy was uneasy suspicious antagonistic butnot afraid</s>  he looked at the heavy animal face with the superiority ofintelligence at the halfnaked figure with the conscious supremacy ofdress at the lower individuality with the contempt of a higher race</s> yet a moment after when the figure wheeled and disappeared towards theundulating west a strange chill crept over him</s>  yet he did not knowthat in this puerile phantom and painted pigmy the awful majesty ofdeath had passed him by</s> mamma</s> it was susys voice struggling into consciousness</s>  perhaps she had beeninstinctively conscious of the boys sudden fears</s> hush</s> he had just turned to the objective point of the indians gaze</s>  therewas something</s>  a dark line was moving along with the gathering darkness</s> for a moment he hardly dared to voice his thoughts even to himself</s> it was a following train overtaking them from the rear</s>  and from therapidity of its movements a train with horses hurrying forward toevening camp</s>  he had never dreamt of help from that quarter</s>  thiswas what the indians keen eyes had been watching and why he had soprecipitately fled</s> the strange train was now coming up at a round trot</s>  it was evidentlywell appointed with five or six large wagons and several outriders</s>  inhalf an hour it would be here</s>  yet he refrained from waking susy whohad fallen asleep again his old superstition of securing her safetyfirst being still uppermost</s>  he took off his jacket to cover hershoulders and rearranged her nest</s>  then he glanced again at the comingtrain</s>  but for some unaccountable reason it had changed its directionand instead of following the track that should have brought it to hisside it had turned off to the left</s>  in ten minutes it would pass abreastof him a mile and a half away</s>  if he woke susy now he knew she would behelpless in her terror and he could not carry her half that distance</s> he might rush to the train himself and return with help but he wouldnever leave her alonein the darkness</s>  never</s>  if she woke she would dieof fright perhaps or wander blindly and aimlessly away</s>  no</s>  the trainwould pass and with it that hope of rescue</s>  something was in his throatbut he gulped it down and was quiet again albeit he shivered in thenight wind</s> the train was nearly abreast of him now</s>  he ran out of the tall grasswaving his straw hat above his head in the faint hope of attractingattention</s>  but he did not go far for he found to his alarm that whenhe turned back again the clump of mesquite was scarcely distinguishablefrom the rest of the plain</s>  this settled all question of his going</s>  evenif he reached the train and returned with some one how would he everfind her again in this desolate expanse</s>

had gone throughhad left no embarrassing record behind it they were willing to repeattheir experiences on the morrow confident of some equally happy end</s> and when clarence timidly reaching his hand

of their owndinners usually laid on bare boards beneath the sky or under the lowhood of the wagon in rainy weather and marveled</s>  and when they finallyhalted and were lifted from their horses and

a limp and helpless figure against the wall the closingof the crowd again around it although it stirred him with a fearfulcuriosity actually shocked him less hopelessly than their brutishenjoyments

glance roundthe room he began to make his way through the crowd towards the front</s> but in that parting glance he caught a glimpse of a woman presiding overa wheel of fortune in a corner whose face

and wilderness he began toyearn for the companionship of his humble associatesthe teamster thescout gildersleeve and even jim hooker</s>  but above all and before allwas the wild desire to get away from these maddening streets andtheir bewildering occupants</s>  he ran back to the bakers gathered hispurchases together took advantage of a friendly doorway to strap themon his boyish shoulders

turbid riverbefore it had sunk well behind him</s>  the air was cool and soft a yellowmoon swam in the slight haze that rose above the tules in the distancea few scattered cottonwoods and sycamores marked like sentinels theroad</s>  when he had walked some distance he sat down beneath one of themto make a frugal supper from the dry rations in his pack but in theabsence of any spring he was forced to quench his thirst with a glass ofwater in a wayside tavern</s>  here he was goodhumoredly offeredsomething stronger which he declined and replied to certain curiousinterrogations by saying that he expected to overtake his friends in awagon further on</s>  a new distrust of mankind had begun to make the boyan adept in innocent falsehood the more deceptive as his carelesscheerful manner

midnight when weary in body but still hopeful andhappy in mind he turned off the dusty road into a vast rolling expanseof wild oats with the same sense of security of rest as a traveler tohis inn</s>  here completely screened from view by the tall stalks of grainthat rose thickly around him to the height of a mans shoulder he beatdown a few of them for a bed on which he deposited his blanket</s>  placinghis pack for a pillow he curled himself up in his blanket and speedilyfell asleep</s> he awoke at sunrise refreshed invigorated and hungry</s>
 this he found a mile further on near some dwarfwillows on the bank of a halfdry stream</s>  of his various efforts toprepare his first meal the fire was the most successful the coffeewas somewhat too substantially thick and the bacon and herring lackeddefiniteness of quality from having been cooked in the same vessel</s> in this boyish picnic he missed susy and recalled perhaps a littlebitterly her coldness at parting</s>  but the novelty of his situation thebrilliant sunshine and sense of freedom and the road already awakeningto dusty life with passing teams dismissed everything but the

to be feared that clarencesaccount of himself was equally fanciful with his previous story andthat the teamster parted from him with a genuine regret and a hope thathe would soon be overtaken by his
