we may now pass to performances that are nearer to the accepted surfaceof things</s>  a short but charming example of diderots taste for puttingquestions of morals in an interesting way is found in the conversationof a father with his children published in 1773</s>  this little dialogueis perfect in the simple realism of its form</s>  its subject is the perilof setting ones own judgment of some special set of circumstances abovethe law of the land</s>  diderots venerable and wellloved father issitting in his armchair before the fire</s>  he begins the discussion bytelling his two sons and his daughter who are tending him with piouscare how very near he had once been to destroying their inheritance</s>  anold priest had died leaving a considerable fortune</s>  there was believedto be no will and the next of kin were a number of poor people whom theinheritance would have rescued from indigence for the rest of theirdays</s>  they appointed the elder diderot to guard their interests anddivide the property</s>  he finds at the bottom of a disused box of ancientletters receipts and other wastepaper a will made long years agoand bequeathing all the fortune to a very rich bookseller in paris</s> there was every reason to suppose that the old priest had forgotten theexistence of the will and it involved a revolting injustice</s>  would notdiderot be fulfilling the dead mans real wishes by throwing theunwelcome document into the flames</s> at this point in the dialogue the doctor enters the room and interruptsthe tale</s>  it appears that he is fresh from the bedside of a criminal whois destined to the gallows</s>  diderot the younger reproaches him forlabouring to keep in the world an offender whom it were best to send outof it with all despatch</s>  the duty of the physician is to say to soexecrable a patienti will not busy myself in restoring to life acreature whom it is enjoined upon me by natural equity the good ofsociety the wellbeing of my fellowcreatures to give up</s>  die and letit never be said that through my skill there exists a monster the moreon earth</s>  the doctor parries these energetic declamations withsufficient skill</s>  my business is to cure not to judge i shall curehim because that is my trade then the judge will have him hungbecause that is his trade</s>  this episodic discussion ended the story ofthe will is resumed</s>  the father when on the point of destroying it wasseized with a scruple of conscience and hastened to a cur well versedin casuistry</s>  as in england the agents of the law itself not seldom playthe part of arbitrary benevolence which the old diderot would fain haveplayed against the law the scene may perhaps be worth transcribing  nothing is more praiseworthy sir than the sentiment of  compassion that touches you for these unfortunate people</s>  suppress  the testament and succour themgood but on condition of restoring  to the rightful legatee the exact sum of which you deprive him  neither more nor less</s>  who authorised you to give a sanction to  documents or to take it away</s>  who authorised you to interpret the  intentions of the dead</s>   but then father bouin the old box</s>   who authorised you to decide whether the will was thrown away on  purpose or mislaid by accident</s>  has it never happened to you to do  such a thing and to find at the bottom of a chest some valuable  paper that you had tossed there inadvertently</s>   but father bouin the faroff date of the paper and its  injustice</s>   who authorised you to pronounce on the justice or injustice of the  document and to regard the bequest as an unlawful gift rather  than as a restitution or any other lawful act which you may choose  to imagine</s>   but these poor kinsfolk here on the spot and that mere  collateral distant and wealthy</s>   who authorised you to weigh in your balance what the dead man owed  to his distant relations whom you dont know</s>   but father bouin that pile of letters

infringe the  laws to enter into the intention of the dead or to dispose of  other peoples property</s>  if providence has resolved to chastise  either the heir or the legatee or the testatorwe cannot

journeyman of the neighbourhood comes in with a new case ofconscience</s>  his wife has died after twenty years of sickness in thesetwenty years the cost of her illness has consumed all that he wouldotherwise have saved for the end of his days</s>  but as it happens themarriage portion that she brought him has lain untouched</s>  by law thisought to go to her family</s>  equity however seems to justify him inkeeping what he might have spent if he had chosen</s>  he consults the partyround the fire</s>  one bids him keep the money another forbids him athird thinks it fair for him to repay himself the cost of his wifesillness</s>  diderots father cries out that since on his own confessionthe detention of the inheritance has brought him no comfort he hadbetter surrender it as speedily as possible and eat drink sleepwork and make himself happy so</s>   not i cried the journeyman abruptly i shall be off to  geneva</s>   and dost thou think to leave remorse behind</s>   i cant tell but to geneva i go</s>   go where thou wilt there wilt thou find thy conscience</s>   the hatter went away his odd answer became the subject of our  talk</s>  we agreed that perhaps distance of place and time had the  effect of weakening all the feelings more or less and stifling the  voice of conscience even in cases of downright crime</s>  the assassin  transported to the shores of china is too far off to perceive the  corpse that he has left bleeding on the banks of the seine</s>   remorse springs perhaps less from horror of self than from fear of  others less from shame for the deed than from the blame and  punishment that would attend its discovery</s>  and what clandestine  criminal is tranquil enough in his obscurity not to dread the  treachery of some unforeseen circumstance or the indiscretion of  some thoughtless word</s>  what certainty can he have that he will not  disclose his secret in the delirium of fever or in dreams</s>  people  will understand him if they are on the scene of the action but  those about him in china will have no key to his words</s> 2 2 v</s>  295 296</s> two other cases come up</s>  does the husband or wife who is the first tobreak the marriage

ravished from them by themonopolist or the fraudulent taxgatherer</s>  the judges were bribed theinnocent were afflicted the guilty escaped unharmed</s>  the cobblermeditating on these enormities

execute it</s>  justice done heregained his stall rejoicing as though he had slain a rabid dog</s>  whensome fifty criminals had thus met their doom the viceroy offered areward of two thousand crowns for information of the slayer and sworeon the altar that he should have full pardon if he gave himself up</s>  thecobbler presented himself and spoke thus i have done what was yourduty</s>  tis i who

beginwith yourself but i respected in your person the august master whom yourepresent</s>  my life is in your hands dispose of it as you think right</s> well cried the abb the cobbler in spite of all his fine zeal forjustice was simply a murderer</s>  diderot protested</s>  his father decidedthat the abb was right and that the cobbler was an assassin</s> nothing short of a transcript of the whole would convey a right idea ofthe dramatic ease of this delightful dialogueits variety ofillustration with unity of topic the naturalness of movement thepleasant lightness of touch</s>  at its close the old man calls for hisnightcap diderot embraces him and in bidding him goodnight whispersin his ear strictly speaking father there are no laws for the sage</s> all being open to exception tis for him to judge the cases in which weought to submit to them or to throw them over</s>  i should not besorry his father answers if there were in the town one or twocitizens like thee but nothing would induce me to live there if theyall thought in that way</s>  the conclusion is just and diderot might haveverified it by the state of the higher society of his country at thatvery moment</s>  one cause of the moral corruption of france in the closingyears of the old rgime was undoubtedly the lax and shiftinginterpretations by which the jesuit directors had softened the rigourof general moral principles</s>  many generations must necessarily elapsebefore a habit of loosely superseding principles in individual casesproduces widespread demoralisation but the result is inevitable sooneror later and this just in proportion as the principles are sound</s>  thecasuists practically constructed a system for making the observancealike of the positive law and of the accepted ethical maxims flexibleand conditional</s>  the diderot of the present dialogue takes the sameattitude but has the grace to leave the demonstration of itsimpropriety to his wise and benevolent sire</s>           ii</s>  we shall presently see that diderot did not shrink from applying avigorous doubt to some of the most solidly established principles ofmodern society</s>  let us meanwhile in passing notice that short piece ofplangent irony which did not appear until many years after his death1798 and which he or some one else entitled on the inconsistency ofthe public judgment on our private actions</s>  this too is in the form ofdialogue but the argument of the story is in its pith as follows</s> desroches first an abb then a lawyer lastly a soldier persuades arich and handsome widow to marry him</s>  she is aware of his previousgallantries and warns him in very dramatic style before a solemngathering of friends that if he once wounds her by an infidelity shewill shut herself up and speedily die of grief</s>  he makes such vows asmost men would make under such circumstances he presses her handsardently to his lips bedews them with his tears and moves the wholecompany to sympathy with his own agitation</s>  the scene is absurd enoughor seems so to us dull people of phlegmatic habit</s>  yet diderot even forus redeems it by the fine remark tis the effect of what is good andvirtuous to leave a large assembly with only one thought and one soul</s> how all respect one another love one another in such moments</s>  forinstance how beautiful humanity is at the play</s>  ah why must we part soquickly</s>  men are so good so happy when what is worthy unites all theirsuffrages melts them makes them one</s> 3 for some time all went welland our pair were the happiest of men and women</s>  then various assaultswere made on the faithfulness of desroches</s>  he resisted them until inendeavouring to serve a friend he was forced to sue for the goodwill ofa lady with whom in his unregenerate days he had had passages ofgallantry</s>  the old intrigue was renewed</s>  letters of damning proof fellby ill hazard into his wifes hands</s>  she reassembled her friendsdenounced the culprit and forthwith carried away her child to seekshelter with her aged mother</s>  desrochess fervent remorse was unheededhis letters were sent back unopened he was denied the door</s>  presentlythe aged mother died</s>  then the infant</s>  lastly the wife herself</s>  nowsays diderot to his interlocutor i pray you to turn your eyes to thepublicthat imbecile crowd that pronounces judgment on us thatdisposes of our honour that lifts us to the clouds or trails us throughthe mud</s>  opinion passed through every phase about desroches</s>  theshifting event is ever their one measure of praise and blame</s>  a faultwhich nobody thought more than venial became gradually aggravated intheir eyes by a succession of incidents which it was impossible fordesroches either to foresee or to prevent</s>  at first opinion was on hisside and his wife was thought to have carried things with too high ahand</s>  then after she had fallen ill and her child had died and heraged mother had passed away in the fulness of years he began to be heldanswerable for all this sea of troubles</s>  why had not desroches writtento his wife beset her doors waylaid her as she went to church</s>  hehad as matter of fact done all these things but the public did notknow it</s>  the important thing is not to know but to talk</s>  then as itbefell his wifes brother took desrochess

stricken in years</s>  how could he foresee thata hostile ball would pierce his brotherinlaw in his first campaign</s> but his wife</s>  he must be a barbarian a monster who had graduallypressed a poniard into the bosom of a divine woman his wife hisbenefactress and then left her to die without showing the least signof interest or feeling</s>  and all this cries diderot for not knowingwhat was concealed from him and what was unknown and unsuspected evenby those who were daily about her</s>  what presumption what bad logicwhat incoherence what unjustified veering and vacillation in all thesepublic verdicts from beginning to end</s>  3 oeuv</s>  v</s>  342</s> yet we feel that diderots impetuous taunts fail to press to the root ofthe matter</s>  diderot excels in opening a subject he places it in a newlight he furnishes telling concrete illustrations he thoroughlydisturbs and unsettles the medium of conventional association in whichit has become fixed</s>  but he does not leave the question readjusted</s>  hismind was not of that quality which is slow to complain where it cannotexplain which does not quit a discussion without a calm and orderlyreview of the conditions that underlie the latest exhibition of humanfolly shortsightedness or injustice</s>  the public condemnation ofdesroches for consequences that were entirely strange to his oneoffence was indefensible on grounds of strict logic</s>  but then men haveimagination as well as reason</s>  imagination is stronger than reason withmost of them</s>  their imagination was touched by the series of disastersthat followed madame desrochess abandonment of her husband</s>  they admitno plea of remoteness of damage such as law courts allow</s>  in a way thatwas loose and unreasonable but still easily intelligible the husbandbecame associated with a sequel for which he was not really answerable</s> if the worlds conduct in such cases were accurately expressed it wouldperhaps be found that people have really no intention to pronounce ajudicial sentence they only mean that an individuals associations havebecome disagreeable and doubtful to them</s>  they may think proper tojustify the grievously meagre definition of homo as animalrationale by varnishing their distaste with reasons the true reasonis that the presence of a desroches disturbs their comfort by recallingquestionable and disorderly circumstances</s>  that this selfish and roughmethod many a time inflicts horrible cruelty is too certain and thoseto whom the idea of conduct is serious and deepreaching will not fallinto it</s>  a sensible man is aware of the difficulty of pronouncing wiselyupon the conduct of others especially where it turns upon theintricate and unknowable relations between a man and a woman</s>  he willnot however on that account break down the permanent safeguards forthe sake of leniency in a given case</s>  a great enemy to indifference agreat friend to indulgence said turgot of himself and perhaps it iswhat we should all do well to be able to say of ourselves</s> again though these ironical exposures of the fatuity and recklessnessand inconsistency of popular verdicts are wholesome enough in theirdegree in all societies yet it has been and still remains a defect ofsome of the greatest french writers to expect a fruit from suchperformances which they can never bear</s>  in the long run a great body ofmen and women is improved less by general outcry against its collectivecharacteristics than by the inculcation of broader views highermotives and sounder habits of judgment in such a form as touches eachman and woman individually</s>  it is better to awaken in the individual asense of responsibility for his own character than to do anythingeither by magnificent dithyrambs or penetrating satire to dispose himto lay the blame on society</s>  society is after all only a name for otherpeople</s>  an instructive contrast might be drawn between the method offrench writers of genius from diderot down to that mighty master of ourown day victor hugo in pouring fulminant denunciations upon societyand the other method of our best english writers from milton down tomill in impressing new ideas on the individual and exacting avigorous personal answer to the moral or spiritual call</s> one other remark may be worth making</s>  it is characteristic of theimmense sociability of the eighteenth century that when he sawdesroches sitting alone in the public room receiving no answers to hisquestions never addressed by any of those around him avoided coldlyeyed and morally proscribed diderot never thought of applying theartificial consolation of the stoic</s>  he never dreamed of urging thatexpulsion from the society of friends was not a hardship a truepunishment and a genuine evil</s>  no one knew better than diderot that aman should train himself to face the disapprobation of the world withsteadfast brow and unflinching gaze but he knew also that this is onlydone at great cost and is only worth doing for clear and farreachingobjects</s>  life was real to diderot not in the modern canting sense ofearnestness and making a hundred thousand pounds but in the sense ofbeing an agitated scene of living passion interest sympathy struggledelight and woe in which the graceful ascetic commonplaces of thewriter and the preacher barely touch the actual conditions of humanexperience or go near to softening the smart of chagrin failuremistake and sense of wrong any more than the sweet music of the birdspoised in air over a field of battle can still the rage and horror ofthe plain beneath</s>  as was said by a good man who certainly did not failto try the experimentspeciosa quidem ista sunt oblitaque rhetoricet music melle dulcedinis tum

close this chapter with a short account of the supplementto bougainvilles travels which was composed in 1772 and publishedtwentyfour years later</s>  the second title is a dialogue on thedisadvantage of attaching moral ideas to certain physical actions whichdo not really comport with them</s>  those who believe that the rulingsystem of notions about marriage represents the last word that is to besaid as to the relations between men and women will turn away fromdiderots dialogue with some impatience</s>  those on the contrary whohold that the present system is no more immovably fixed in ultimate lawsof human nature no more final no more unimprovable no more sacredand no more indisputably successful than any other set of socialarrangements and the corresponding moral ideas will find something tointerest them though as it seems to the present writer very little toinstruct</s>  bougainville was the first frenchman who sailed round theworld</s>  he did in 176669 what captain cook did about the same time</s>  thenarrative of his expedition appeared in 1771 and the picture of lifeamong the primitive people of the southern seas touched diderot almostas deeply as if he had been rousseau</s>  as one says so often in thishistory of the intellectual preparation for the revolution thecorruption and artificiality of parisian society had the effect ofcolouring the world of primitive society with the very hues of paradise</s> diderot was more free from this besetting weakness than any of hiscontemporaries</s>  he never fell into voltaires fancy that china is a landof philosophers</s> 5 but he did not look very critically into the realconditions of life in the more rudimentary stages of development andfor the moment he committed the sociological anachronism of making thepoor people of otaheite into wise and benevolent patriots and soundreasoners</s>  the literary merit of the dialogue is at least as striking asin any of the pieces of which we have already spoken</s>  the realism of thescenes between the shipchaplain and his friendly savage with tookindly wife and daughters as kindly as either is full of sweetnesssimplicity and a sort of pathos</s>  a subject which easily takes on an airof grossness and which diderot sometimes handled very grossly indeedis introduced with an idyllic grace that to the pure will hardly beother than pure</s>  we have of course always to remember that diderot is anauthor for grownup people as are the authors of the bible or any otherbook that deals with more than the surface of human experience</s>  ourenglish practice of excluding from literature subjects and referencesthat are unfit for boys and girls has something to recommend it but itundeniably leads to a certain narrowness and thinness and to some mostnauseous hypocrisy</s>  all subjects are evidently not to be discussed byall and one result in our case is that some of the most importantsubjects in the world receive no discussion whatever</s>  5 see however above vol</s>  i</s>  p</s>  274</s> the position which diderot takes up in the present dialogue may beinferred from the following extract</s>  the shipchaplain has beenexplaining to the astonished otaheitan the european usage of strictmonogamy as the arrangement enjoined upon man by the creator of theuniverse and vigilantly guarded by the priest and the magistrate</s>  towhich orou thus  these singular precepts i find opposed to nature and contrary to  reason</s>  they are contrary to nature because they suppose that a  being who thinks feels and is free can be the property of a

to these two strong currents</s>  orwe may say that hatred of religion and passion for justice and freedomwere in fact the subjects and that the commercial establishments andpolitical relations of the

history</s>  gibbon resorted to the same device shortly afterwards andfound in the contemptuous analysis of heresies and the selfish andviolent motives of councils and prelates as good an occasion

reproachfulbackground which gibbon so artistically introduced in the humaneintelligent and happy epoch of the pagan antonines raynal invented forthe same purpose of making christianity seem uglier in

religionof the ages of faith had been how enormous a task remained and howmuch the most arduous part of this task was to make catholicism itselfcivilised and moral</s>  for it is hardly denied that christianity had doneworse than merely fail to provide an effective curb on the cruelpassions of men</s>  the spanish conquerors showed that it had nursed astill more cruel passion than the rude interests of material selfishnesshad ever engendered by making the extermination or enslavement of thesehapless people a duty to the catholic church and a savoury sacrifice inthe nostrils of the most

diderot as we have already pointed out183 was always very near tothe position that there is no such thing as an absolute rule of rightand wrong defining classes of acts unconditionally but each act

to theprovinces or cross for a week the designs of the miscreants by whom theemperor was surrounded then seneca would have been blamed and wouldhave deserved blame if he had either retired from court or put an endto his life</s> 184 this is all true enough and if seneca had been only astatesman the world would probably have applauded him for clinging tothe helm at all cost</s>  unhappily he was not only a statesman but amoralist</s>  the two characters are always hard to reconcile as perhapsany parliamentary candidate might tell us</s>  the contrast between loftywriting and slippery policy

quarrel of the century</s>  soon after rousseau settled in parisfor the last time on his return from england and the subsequentvagabondage it was known that he had written the confessions dealingat least as freely with the lives of others as with his own</s>  he had evenin 1770 and 1771 given readings of certain passages from them untilmadame depinay and perhaps also the marchale de luxemburg prevailedon the authorities to interfere</s>  no one was angrier than diderot andin the first edition of the essay published in the year of rousseausdeath 1778 he incongruously placed in the midst of his disquisitionson the philosopher of the first century a long and acrimonious noteupon the perversities of the reactionary philosopher of the eighteenth</s> he was believed by those who talked to him to be in dread of theappearance of the confessions and we may accept this readily enoughwithout assuming that diderot was conscious of hidden enormities whichhe was afraid of seeing publicly uncovered</s>  rousseau as diderot wellknew was so wayward so strangely oblique both in vision and judgmentthat innocence was no security against malice and misrepresentation</s> rousseaus name has never lacked fanatical partisans down to our ownday and diderot was attacked by some of the earliest of them for hisnote of disparagement</s>  the first part of the confessionsall thatdiderot ever sawappeared in 1782 and in the same year diderotpublished a second edition of the essay on claudius and nero soaugmented by replies inserted in season and out of season to thediatribes of the party of rousseau that as it now stands the reader maywell doubt whether the substance and foundation of the book is anapology for seneca or a vindication of denis diderot</s>  as grimm said wehave to make up

dramaticenthusiasm making the one speak and the others answer apostrophisinghimself and apostrophising his readers and leaving them often enough inperplexity as to the personage who is speaking and the personage whom headdresses</s> 185 we may agree with grimm that this gives an air oforiginality to the performance but such originality is of a kind todisplease the serious student without really

diderot whohad all his life borne the sting of the gnats of grub street with decentcomposure should have been so moved by rousseau or by meanerassailants whom rousseau himself would have rudely disclaimed</s>  theexplanation seems to lie in this fact of human character that a man ofdiderots temperament while entirely heedless of criticism directedagainst his opinions or his public position is specially sensitive toinnuendoes against his private benevolence and loyalty</s>  an insult to theforce of his understanding was indifferent to him but an affront toones belle me is beyond pardon</s>  it was hard that a man who hadprodigally thrown away the forces of his life for others should becharged with malignity of heart and an incapacity for friendship</s>  thiswas the harder because it was the moral fashion of that day to placefriendliness amiability the desire to please and to serve at the veryhead of all the virtues</s>  the whole correspondence of the time ispenetrated to an incomparable degree by a caressing spirit it issometimes too elaborate and farfetched in expression but it marks avivid sociability and even a true humanity that softens and harmonisesthe sharpness of mens egotism</s> again though diderot himself is not ungenerously handled in theconfessions there are passages about madame depinay and madamedhoudetot which not only stamp rousseau with ingratitude towards twowomen who had treated him kindly but which were calculated to makepractical mischief among people still living</s>  all this was atrocious initself and the atrocity seemed more black to diderot than to othersbecause he had for some years known madame depinay as a friendlycreature and above all because grimm was her lover</s>  perhaps we mayadd among the reasons that stirred him to pen these diatribes aconsciousness of the harm that rousseaus sentimentalism had done tosound and positive thinking</s>  but this we may be sure would beinfinitely less potent than the motives

in his head for he shows the good  qualities that nature has bestowed on him without any ostentation  and the bad ones without the smallest shame</s>  for the rest he is  endowed with a vigorous frame a particular warmth of imagination  and an astonishing strength of lungs</s>  if you ever meet him and if  you are not arrested by his originality you will either stuff your  fingers into your ears or else take to your heels</s>  heavens what a  monstrous pipe</s>  nothing is so little like him as himself</s>  one time  he is lean and wan like a patient in the last stage of  consumption you could

along with a bent head you  are tempted to hail him and fling him a shilling</s>  tomorrow all  powdered curled in a fine coat he marches past with head erect  and open mien and you would almost take him for a decent worthy  creature</s>  he lives from day to day from hand to mouth downcast or  sad just as things may go</s>  his first care in a morning when he  gets up is to know where he will dine and after dinner he begins  to think where he may pick up a supper</s>  night brings disquiets of  its own</s>  either he climbs to a shabby garret that he has unless  the landlady weary of waiting for her rent has taken the key away  from him or else he slinks to some tavern on the outskirts of the  town where he waits for daybreak over a piece of bread and a mug  of beer</s>  when he has not threepence in his pocket as sometimes  happens he has recourse either to a hackney carriage belonging to  a friend or to the coachman of some man of quality who gives him  a bed on the straw beside the horses</s>  in the morning he still has  bits of his mattress in his hair</s>  if the weather is mild he  measures the champs elyses all night long</s>  with the day he  reappears in the town dressed over night for the morrow and from  the morrow sometimes dressed for the rest of the week</s>   i do not rate these originals very highly</s>  other people make  familiar acquaintances

uniformity which our bringingup our social  conventions and our arbitrary fashions have introduced</s>  if one of  them makes his appearance in a company he is a piece of leaven  which ferments and

watch him in this  state of constraint</s>  if he could not resist breaking the treaty  and ever began to open his mouth at the first word all the guests  called out rameau</s>  then fury sparkled in his eyes and he turned  to his plate in a worse passion than ever</s>  you were curious to know  the mans name and now you know it tis rameau pupil of the  famous man who delivered us from the

showed as plain as one and one make  two that nothing was more useful to people than falsehood nothing  more mischievous than truth</s>  i dont remember his proofs very  clearly but it evidently followed from them that men of genius are  detestable and that if a child at its birth bore on its brow the  mark of that dangerous gift of nature it ought to be smothered or  else thrown to the ducks</s>   i</s> yet such people foes as they are to genius all lay claim to  it</s>   he</s> i daresay they think so in their own minds but i doubt if  they would venture to admit it</s>   i</s> ah

 thought of being only a common man</s>  you will never be happy if the  pro and the con distress you alike</s>  you should take your side and  keep to it</s>  though people will agree with you that men of genius  are usually singular or as the proverb says there are no great  wits without a grain of madness yet they will always look down on  ages that have produced no men of genius</s>  they will pay honour to  the nations among whom they have existed sooner or later they  rear statues to them and regard them as the benefactors of the  human race</s>  with all deference to the sublime minister whom you  have cited i still believe that if falsehood may sometimes be  useful for a moment it is surely hurtful in the longrun and so  on the other hand truth is surely useful in the longrun though  it may sometimes chance to be inconvenient for the moment</s>  whence i  should be tempted to conclude that the man of genius who cries down  a general error or wins credit for a great truth is always a  creature that deserves our veneration</s>  it may happen that such an  one falls a victim to prejudice and the laws but there are two  sorts of laws the one of an equity and generality that is  absolute the other of an incongruous kind which owe all their  sanction to the blindness or exigency of circumstance</s>  the latter  only cover the culprit who infringes them with

genius</s>   i</s> but listen to me my good man</s>  a society ought not to have  bad laws and if it had only good ones it would never find itself  persecuting a man of genius</s>  i never said to you that genius was  inseparably bound up with wickedness any more than wickedness is  with genius</s>  a fool is many a time far worse than a man of parts</s>   even supposing a man of genius to be

not take your uncle rameau for  an instance he is harsh he is brutal he has no humanity he is a  miser he is a bad father bad husband bad uncle but it has never  been settled that he is particularly

did you say that of him</s>   he</s> because all the fine things he did never brought him twenty  thousand francs and if he had been a silk merchant in the rue  saint denis or saint honor a good

pleasures of every colour  diversion of every sort</s>  i would as lief be a beggar as possess a  mighty fortune without any of these enjoyments</s>  but go back to  racine</s>  he was only good for

men in all the  countries of the earth he will inspire compassion tenderness  pity</s>  they will ask who he was and to what land he belonged and  france will be envied</s>  he brought suffering on one or two people  who are dead and in whom we take hardly any interest we have  nothing to fear from his vices or his foibles</s>  it would have been  better no doubt that he should have received from nature the  virtues of a good man instead of the talents of a great one</s>  he is  a tree which made a few other trees planted near him wither up and  which smothered the plants that grew at his feet but he reared his  height to the clouds and his branches spread far he lends his  shadow to all who came or come now or ever shall come to repose  by his majestic trunk he brought forth fruits of exquisite savour  which are renewed again and again without ceasing</s>   we might wish that voltaire had the mildness of duclos the  ingenuousness of the abb trublet the rectitude of the abb  dolivet</s>  but as that cannot be let us look at the thing on the  side of it that is really interesting let us forget for an instant  the point we occupy in space and time and let us extend our  vision over centuries to come and peoples yet unborn and distant  lands yet unvisited</s>  let us think of the good of our race if we  are not generous enough at least let us forgive nature for being  wiser than ourselves</s>  if you throw cold water on greuzes head  very likely you will extinguish his talent along with his vanity</s>   if you make voltaire less sensitive to criticism he will lose

i</s> there is nobody but thinks as you do and whoever brings his  indictment against the order of things forgets that he is  renouncing his own existence</s>   he</s> that is true</s>   i</s> so let us accept things as they are let us see how much they  cost us and how much they give us and leave the whole as it is  for we do not know it well enough either to praise or blame it and  perhaps after
