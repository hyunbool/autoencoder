simpleminded gentle brave man very religious after hisown fashion and an excellent soldier with the true angloindianfaculty for administration and organisation</s>  it was partly fromhim no doubt that the boys inherited their marked intelligenceand it was wholly from him beyond any doubt at all that ernestand his younger brother ronald inherited their moral or religioussincerityfor that was an element in which poor formally orthodoxlady le breton was wholly deficient</s>  the good general had beenbrought up in the strictest doctrines of the clapham sect he hadgone to india young as a cadet from haileybury and he had appliedhis intellect all his life long rather to the arduous task ofextending the blessings of british rule to sikhs and ghoorkas thanto those abstract ethical or theological questions which agitatedthe souls of a later generation</s>  if a new district had to beassimilated in settlement to the established model of the britishraj if a tribe of hillsavages had to be conciliated by gentlermeans than rifles or bayonets if a difficult bit of diplomaticduty had to be performed on the debateable frontiers sir owen lebreton was always the person chosen to undertake it</s>  an earnesthonest godfearing man he remained to the end impressed by aprofound sense of duty as he understood it and a firm convictionthat his true business in life consisted in serving his queen andcountry and in bringing more and more of the native populationswithin the pale of the companys empire and the future evangelisationthat was ultimately to follow</s>  but during the great upheaval ofthe mutiny he fell at the head of his own unrevolted regiment inone of the hottest battles of that terrible time and my lady lebreton found herself left alone with three young children on littlemore than the scanty pension of a general officers widow on thelate companys establishment</s>
happily enough remained to bring up the boys with the aidof their terminable annuities which fell in on their attainingtheir majority in decent respect for the feelings and demands ofexacting society and as the two elder were decidedly clever boysthey managed to get scholarships at oxford which enabled themto tide over the dangerous intermediate period as far as theirdegree</s>  herbert then stepped at once into a fellowship and sundryother good things of like sort and ernest was even now trying tofollow in his brothers steps in this particular</s>  only the youngestboy ronald still remained quite unprovided for</s>  ronald was atall pale gentle weakly enthusiastic young fellow of nineteenwith so marked a predisposition to lung disease that it had not beenthought well to let him run the chance of overreading himself andso he had to be content with remaining at home in the uncongenialatmosphere of epsilon terrace instead of joining his two elderbrothers at the university</s>  uncongenial because ronald alonefollowed sir owen in the religious half of his nature and foundthe worldliness and conventionality of his unflinching mother aserious bar to his enjoyment of home society</s> ronald said my lady at the breakfasttable on the very morningof arthur berkeleys little luncheon party heres a letter foryou from mackenzie and anderson</s>  no doubt your aunt sarahs willhas been recovered and proved at last and i hope itll turn outsatisfactory as we wish it</s> for my part i really almost hope it wont mother said ronaldturning it over for i dont want to be compelled to profit byernests excessive generosity</s>  hes too good to me just because hethinks me the weaker vessel but though we must bear one anothersburdens you know we should each bear his own cross as wellshouldnt we mother</s> well it cant be much in any case said his mother a littletestily whoever gets it</s>  open the envelope at once my boy anddont stand looking at it like a goose in that abstracted way</s> oh mother she was my fathers only sister and im not in sucha hurry to find out how she has disposed of her mere perishingworldly goods answered ronald gravely</s>  it seems to me a terriblething that before poor dear good aunt sarah is cold in her gravealmost we should be speculating and conjecturing as to what shehas done with her poor little trifle of earthly riches</s> its always usual to read the will immediately after the funeralsaid lady le breton firmly to whom the ordinary usage of societyformed an absolutely unanswerable argument and how you ronaldwho havent even the common decency to wear a bit of crape aroundyour arm for hera thing that ernest himself with all hisnonsensical theories consents to docan talk in that absurd wayabout whats quite right and proper to be done i for my partreally cant imagine</s> ah but you know mother i object to wearing crape on the groundthat it isnt allowable for us to sorrow as them that have no hopeand im sure im paying no disrespect to dear aunt sarahs memoryin this matter for she was always the first herself you rememberto wish that i should follow the dictates of my own conscience</s> i remember she always upheld you in acts of opposition to your ownmother ronald lady le breton said coldly and i suppose youregoing to do honour to her religious precepts now by not openingthat letter when your mother tells you to do so</s>  in my bible siri find a place for the fourth commandment</s> ronald looked at her gently and unreprovingly but though a quietsmile played involuntarily around the corners of his mouth heresisted the natural inclination to correct her mistake and tosuggest blandly that she probably alluded to the fifth</s>  he knewhe must turn his left cheek alsoa christian virtue which he hadabundant opportunities of practising in that household and he feltthat to score off his mother for such a verbal mistake as the oneshe had just made would not be in keeping with the spirit of thecommandment to which no doubt she meant to refer him</s>  so withoutanother word he opened the envelope and glanced rapidly at thecontents of the letter it enclosed</s> theyve found the second will he said after a moment with arather husky voice and theyre taking steps to get it confirmedwhatever that may be</s> broad scotch for getting probate i believe said lady le bretonin a slight tone of irony for to her mind any departure from thelaws or language she was herself accustomed to use assumed at oncethe guise of a rank and offensive provincialism</s>  your poor auntwould go and marry a scotchman and he a scotch business man tooso of course we must expect to put up with all kinds of ridiculoustechnicalities and edinburgh jargon accordingly</s>  all laws badenough in the way of odd words but commend me to scotch law forutter and meaningless incomprehensibility</s>  well and what doesthe second will say ronald</s> there mother cried ronald flinging the letter down hurriedlywith a burst of tears</s>  read it yourself if you will for i cant</s> poor dear aunt sarah and dear good unselfish ernest</s>  it makes mecry even to think of them</s> lady le breton took the paper up from the table without a word andread it carefully through</s>  i am very glad to hear it she saidvery glad indeed to hear it</s>  and in order to guard against anymisinterpretation of my reasons for making this disposition of myproperty your aunt says i wish to put it on record that i hadpreviously drawn up another will bequeathing my effects to be dividedbetween my two nephews ernest and ronald le breton equally that icommunicated the contents of that willa horrid scotticismtomy nephew ernest and that at his express desire i have now revokedit and drawn up this present testament leaving the share intendedfor him to his brother ronald</s>  why she never even mentions dearherbert</s> she knew that herbert had provided for himself ronald answeredraising his head from his hands while ernest and i were unprovidedfor</s>  but ernest said he could fight the world for himself whilei couldnt and that unearned wealth ought only to be acceptedin trust for those who were incapacitated by nature or misfortunefrom earning their own bread</s>  i dont always quite agree withall ernests theories any more than you do but we must both admitthat at least he always conscientiously acts up to them himselfmother mustnt we</s> its a very extraordinary thing lady le breton went on that auntsarah invariably encouraged both you boys in all your absurditiesand quixotisms</s>  she was quixotic herself at heart thats the truthof it just like your poor dear father</s>  i remember once when wewere quartered at meean meer in the punjaub poor dear sir owennearly got into disgrace with the colonelhe was only a sub</s>  inthose daysbecause he wanted to go trying to convert his syceswhich was a most imprudent thing to do and directly opposed tothe companys orders</s>  aunt sarah was just the same</s>  herberts theonly one of you three who has never given me one moments anxietyand of course poor herbert must be passed over in absolute silence</s> however im very glad shes left the money to you ronald asyou need it the most and mackenzie and anderson say itll come toabout a hundred and sixty a year</s> one can do a great deal of good with that much money said ronaldmeditatively</s>  i mean after arranging with you mother for theexpenses of my maintenance at home which of course i shall do assoon as the pension ceases and after meeting ones own necessaryexpenditure in the way of clothing and so forth</s>  its more thanany one christian man ought to spend upon himself im sure</s> its not at all too much for a young man in your position insociety ronald but therei know youll want to spend half ofit on indiscriminate charity</s>  however therell be time enough totalk about that when youve actually got it thank goodness</s> ronald murmured a few words softly to himself of which lady lebreton only caught the last echolaid them down at the apostlesfeet and distribution was made unto every man according as he hadneed</s> just like ernests communistic notions she murmured in returnhalf audibly</s>  i do declare between them both a plain woman hardlyknows whether shes standing on her head or on her heels</s>  i livein daily fear that one or other of them will be taken up by thepolice for being implicated in some dynamite plot or other to blowup the queen or destroy the houses of parliament</s>  ronald smiledagain gently but answered nothing</s>  theres another letter foryou there though with the exmoor coronet upon it</s>  why dont youopen it</s>  i hope its an invitation for you to go down and stop atdunbude for a week or two</s>  nothing on earth would do you so muchgood as to get away for a while from your ranters and canters andmix occasionally in a little decent and rational society</s> ronald took up the second letter with a sigh</s>  he feared as muchhimself and had doleful visions of a painful fortnight to bespent in a big country house where the conversation would be allconcerning the slaughter of pheasants and the torture of foxeswhich his soul loathed to listen to</s>  its from lady hilda hesaid glancing through it and it isnt an invitation after all</s> he could hardly keep down a faint tone of gratification as hediscovered this

opportunityof meeting daily with a really nice girl like hilda and thoughof course it isnt likely that hilda would take a fancy to herbrothers tutorthe exmoors are such very conservative peoplein matters of rank and wealth and family and so forthquiteunchristianly so i consideryet it cant fail to improve erneststone a great deal and raise his standard of female society generally</s> its really

theological controversyor established religious constitutions</s>  as long as ronald le bretoncould read his greek testament every morning and talk face toface in their own tongue with the paul of first corinthians or thejohn of the epistles in the solitude of his own bedroom he wassupremely indifferent about the serious question of freewilland foreknowledge or about the important question of apostolicalsuccession or even about that other burning question of eternalpunishment which was just then setting his own little sect ofapostolic christian missioners roundly by the ears</s>  these thingsseemed to his enthusiastic mind mere fading echoes of an alienlanguage all that he himself really cared for in religion was theconstant sense of essential personal communion with that

confidently i dont seeany reason on earth from the point of view of any political economywhatsoever why ernest shouldnt take the position</s>  the questionisnt how the exmoors have come by their money

that itshould go into any other persons</s>  thats the way i for my partlook at the matter</s> what do you say to that friend ernest</s>  asked the old germansmiling and waiting to see whether ernest would detect what fromtheir own standpoint he regarded as the ethical fallacy of harryoswalds argument</s> well to tell you the truth herr schurz answered ernest in hisdeliberate quiet way i dont think ive envisaged the subjectto myself from quite the same point of view as oswald has done</s>  ihave rather asked myself whether it was right of a man to accepta function in which he would really be doing nothing worthy forhumanity in return for his daily board and lodging</s>  it isnt so mucha question who exactly is to get certain sums out of the exmoorspockets which ought no doubt never to have been in them its morea question whether a man has any right to live off the collectivelabour of the world and do nothing of any good to the world onhis own part by way of repayment</s> thats it

but as it was in herfavour she wisely abstained from gratifying her natural desire tomake some more uncomplimentary references to the snuffy old germansocialist</s>  sufficient unto the day was the

very cold on the way down</s>  sheasked</s> yes fairly</s>  im not sorry to see the fire again</s>  why yourequite an accomplished player</s> theres nothing else to do at dunbude thats why</s>  i practiseabout half my lifetime</s>  so i wrote to your brother ronald as iwas telling you from mammas dictation and when i heard you werereally coming i was quite delighted about it</s>  do you remember imet you twice last year once at the dolburys and once somewhereelse and i thought youd be a very good sort of person for dunbudeyou know and about as much use to lynmouth as anybody could bewhich isnt saying much of course for hes a dreadful pickle</s> i insisted on putting in my letter that he was a dreadful picklethats a good stroke off the red just enough side on thoughmamma didnt want me to because i thought you ought to know aboutit beforehand</s>  but you remember him at marlborough of course hewas only a little fellow then but still a pickle</s>  he always was andhe always will be</s>  hes out shooting now with papa and youllnever get him to settle down to anything as long as theres asnipe or a plover banging about on the moor anywhere</s>  hes quiteincorrigible</s>  do you play at all</s>  wont you take a cue till yourlunchs ready</s> no i dont play ernest answered half hesitating or at leastvery little</s> oh then youll learn here because youll find nothing else

nihilist ora fenian or something of that sort and you dont shoot anythingbut czars and grand dukes do you</s>  i believe you want to cut allour heads off and have a red republic</s>  well im sure thats veryrefreshing for down here were all as dull as sticks togethertories every one of us to a man perfect unanimity no differencesof opinion all as conventional and proper as the vicars sermons</s> now to have somebody who wants to cut your head off in the houseis really delightful</s>  i love originality</s>  not that ive ever seenanybody original in all my life for i havent but im sure itwould be delightful if i did</s>  one reads about original people innovels you know dickens and that sort of thing and i often thinki should like to meet some of them good stroke again legs legslegs if you pleaseno it hasnt legs enough but here or forthe matter of that in town either we never see anybody but the sameeternal round of algies and monties and berties and hughsallvery nice

assure you if they were all shaken up in a bagtogether and well mixed in evening clothes so as not to tell themapart by the tweeds you know their own mothers wouldnt be ableto separate them afterwards</s>  but if you dont shoot and dont playbilliards im sure i dont know what youll ever find to do withyourself here at dunbude</s> dont you think ernest said quietly taking down a cue oneought to have something better to do with ones time than shootingand playing billiards</s>  in a world where so many labouring peopleare toiling and slaving in poverty and misery on our behalf dontyou think we should be trying to do something or other in returnfor universal humanity to whom we owe so much for our board andlodging and clothing and amusement</s> well now thats just what i mean said hilda ecstatically witha neat shot off the cushion against the red and into the middlepocket thats such a delightfully original way of looking atthings you see</s>  we all of us here talk always about the partridgesand the red deer and the turnips and the church and dear ladythis and that odious lady that and the growing insolence of thefarmers and the shocking insubordination of the lower classes andthe difficulty of getting really good servants and the dreadfulway those horrid irish are shooting their kindhearted indulgentlandlords or else we talkthe women especiallyabout how awfullybored we are</s>  lawntennis you know and dinners and what a badmatch ethel thingumbob has made</s>  but you talk another kind of slangi dare say it doesnt mean much you know youre not working atanything very much more serious than we are still its a novelty</s> when we go to a coursing meeting were all on the hounds butyoure on the hare and thats so delightfully original</s>  i haventthe least doubt that if we were to talk about the irish youd sayyou thought they ought to shoot their landlords</s>  i remember youshocked mamma by saying something like it at the dolburys</s>  now ofcourse it doesnt matter to me a bit which is right you say thepoor tenants are starving and papa says the poor landlords cantget in their rents and actually have to give up their hounds poorfellows and i dont know which of you is the most to be believedonly what papa says is just the same thing that everybody saysand what you say has a certain charming freshness and varietyabout it</s>  its so funny to be told that one ought really to takethe tenants into consideration</s>  exactly like your brother ronaldsnotions about servants</s> your lunch is ready in the diningroom sir said a voice at thedoor</s> come back here when youve finished mr</s>  le breton hilda calledafter him</s>  ill teach you how to make that cannon you missedjust now</s>  if you mean to exist at dunbude at all its absolutelynecessary for you to learn billiards</s> ernest turned in to lunch with an uncomfortable misgiving on hismind already that dunbude was not exactly the right place for sucha man as he to live in</s> during the afternoon he saw nothing more of the family save ladyhilda and it was not till the party assembled in the drawingroombefore dinner that he met lord and lady exmoor and his future pupil</s> lynmouth had grown into a tall handsome manlylooking boy sinceernest last saw him but he certainly looked exactly what hildahad called hima pickle</s>  a few minutes introductory conversationsufficed to show ernest that whatever mind he possessed was whollygiven over to horses dogs and partridges and that the post oftutor at dunbude castle was not likely to prove a bed of roses</s> seen the paper connemara</s>  lord exmoor asked of one of hisguests as they sat down to dinner</s>  i havent had a moment myselfto snatch a look at the times yet this evening im really toobusy almost even to read the daily papers</s>  anything fresh fromireland</s> havent seen it either lord connemara answered glancing towardslady hilda</s>  perhaps somebody else has looked at the papers</s> nobody answered so ernest ventured to remark that the irish newswas rather worse again</s>  two bailiffs had been murdered near castlebar</s> thats bad lord exmoor said turning towards ernest</s>  im afraidtheres a deal of distress in the west</s> a great deal ernest answered positive starvation i believein some parts of county galway</s> well not quite so bad as that lord exmoor replied a littlestartled</s>  i dont think any of the landlords are actually starvingyet though ive no doubt many of them are put to very great straitsindeed by their inability to get in their rents</s> ernest couldnt forbear gently smiling to himself at the misapprehension</s> oh i didnt mean the landlords he said quickly i meant amongthe poor people</s>  as he spoke he was aware that lady hildas eyeswere fixed keenly upon him and that she was immensely delightedat the temerity and originality displayed in the notion of hispublicly taking irish tenants into consideration at her fatherstable</s> ah the poor people lord exmoor answered with a slight sigh ofrelief as who should say that their condition didnt much matterto a philosophic mind</s>  yes to be sure ive no doubt some ofthem are very badly off poor souls</s>  but then theyre such an idleimprovident lot</s>  why dont they emigrate now i should like toknow</s> ernest reflected silently that the inmates of dunbude castle didnot exactly set them a model of patient industry and that ladyhildas numerous allusions during the afternoon to the fact thatthe dunbude estates were mortgaged up to the eyelids a conditionof affairs to which she always alluded as though it were rather asubject of pride and congratulation than otherwise did not speakvery highly for their provident economy either</s>  but even ernest lebreton had a solitary grain of worldly wisdom laid up somewherein a corner of his brain and he didnt think it advisable to givethem the benefit of his own views upon the subject</s> theres a great deal of rubbish talked in england about irishaffairs you know exmoor said lord connemara confidently</s>  peoplenever understand ireland im sure until theyve actually livedthere</s>  would you believe it now the correspondent of one of thelondon papers was quite indignant the other day because my agenthad to evict a man for three years rent at ballynamara and theman unfortunately went and died a week later on the public roadside</s> we produced medical evidence to show that he had suffered for yearsfrom heart disease and would have died in any case wherever hehad been but the editor

in somehow mustnt they</s> people must get their rents in somehow of course lord exmoorassented sympathetically and i know all you men who are unluckyenough to own property in ireland have a lot of trouble about itnowadays</s>  upon my word what with fenians and what with nihilistsand what with communards i really dont know what the world iscoming to</s> most unchristian conduct i call it said lady exmoor who wentin for being mildly and decorously religious</s>  i really cantunderstand how people can believe such wicked doctrines as thesecommunistic notions that are coming over people in these latterdays</s> no better than downright robbery lord connemara answered</s> shaking the very foundations of society i think it</s>  all done sorecklessly too without any care or any consideration</s> ernest thought of old max schurz with his lifelong economicalstudies and wondered when lord connemara had found time to turnhis own attention from foxes and fishing to economical problemsbut by a perfect miracle he said nothing</s> you wouldnt believe the straits were put to lady exmoor theirish earl went on through this horrid norent business</s>  absolutepoverty i assure youabsolute downright poverty</s>  ive had tosell the maid of garunda this week you know and three others ofthe best horses in my stable just to raise money for immediatenecessities</s>  wanted to buy a most interesting missal quiteunique in its way offered me by menotti and cicolari dirt cheapfor three thousand guineas</s>  its quite a gem of late miniaturistartvellum folio with borders and headpieces by giulio clovio</s> a marvellous bargain</s> giulio clovio said lord exmoor doubtfully</s>  who was he</s>  neverheard of him in my life before</s> never heard of giulio clovio</s>  cried lord connemara seizing theopportunity with wellaffected surprise</s>  you really astonish me</s> he was a croatian i believe or an illyriani forget whichandhe studied at rome under giulio romano</s>  wonderful draughtsman inthe nude and fine colourist took hints from raphael and michaelangelo</s>  so much he had picked up from menotti and cicolari andbeing a distinguished connoisseur had made a mental note of thefacts at once for future reproduction upon a fitting occasion</s> well this missal was executed for cardinal farnese as a companionvolume to the famous vita christi in the towneley collection</s>  youknow it of course lady exmoor</s> of course lady exmoor answered faintly with a devout hope thatlord connemara wouldnt question her any further upon the subjectin which case she thought it would probably be the safest guess tosay that she had seen it at the british museum or in the hamiltonlibrary</s> but lord connemara luckily didnt care to press his advantage</s> the towneley volume you see he went on fluentlyhe was primedto the muzzle with information on that subjectwas given bythe cardinal to the pope of that timepaul the third wasnt itmr</s>  le breton</s> and so got into the possession of old christophertowneley the antiquary</s>  but this companion folio it seems thecardinal wouldnt let go out of his own possession and so itsbeen handed down in his own

me</s>  all the fault of these horrid communiststhat you were speaking of lady exmoorall the fault of thesehorrid communists</s> youre rather a communist yourself arent you mr</s>  le breton</s> asked lady hilda boldly from across the table</s>  i remember you toldme something once about cutting the throats of all the landlords</s> lady exmoor looked as though a bombshell had dropped into thedrawingroom</s>  my dear hilda she said im sure you must havemisunderstood mr</s>  le breton</s>  you cant have meant anything sodreadful as that mr</s>  le breton can you</s> certainly not ernest answered with a clear conscience</s>  ladyhilda has put her own interpretation upon my casual words</s>  i haventthe least desire to cut anybodys throat even metaphorically</s> hilda looked a little disappointed she had hoped for a good rattlingdiscussion in which ernest was to shock the whole tableit doespeople such a lot of good you know to have a nice round shockingbut ernest was evidently not inclined to show fight for her solegratification and so she proceeded to her alternative amusementof getting lord connemara to display the full force of his owninanity</s>  this was an easy and unending source of innocent enjoymentto lady hilda enhanced by the fact that she knew her father andmother were anxious to see her countess of connemara and that theywould be annoyed by her public exposition of that eligible youngmans intense selfishness and emptyheadedness</s> altogether ernest did not enjoy his first week at the exmoors</s> nor did he enjoy the second or the third or the fourth week muchbetter</s>  the society was profoundly distasteful to him the worldwas not his world nor the talk his talk and he grew so sick ofthe perpetual discussion of horses dogs pheasants dances andlawn tennis with occasional digressions on giulio clovio and theconnemara gallery that he found even a chat with lady hilda whoknew and cared for nothing but liked to chat with him becausehe was so original a pleasant relief by comparison from theeternal round of lord exmoors anecdotes about famous racers orcelebrated actresses</s>  but worst of all he did not like his workhe felt that useless as he considered it he was not successfullyperforming even the useless function he was paid to fulfil</s>  lynmouthcouldnt learn wouldnt learn and wasnt going to learn</s>  ernestmight as well have tried to din the necessary three plays of euripidesinto the nearest lamppost</s>  nobody encouraged him to learn in anyway indeed lord exmoor remembered that he himself had scrapedthrough somehow at christ church with the aid of a private tutorand the magic of his title and he hadnt the least doubt thatlynmouth would scrape through in his turn in like manner</s>  and sothough most young men would have found the dunbude tutorship thevery acme of their wishesplenty of amusements and nothing to dofor themernest le breton found it to the last degree irksome andunsatisfactory</s>  not that he had ever to complain of any unkindlinesson the part of the exmoor family they were really in their ownway very kindhearted friendly sort of peoplethat is to saytowards all members of their own circle and as they consideredernest one of themselves in virtue of their acquaintance withhis mother they really did their best to make him as happy andcomfortable as was in their power</s>  but then he was such a verystrange young man</s>  for what on earth can you do as lord exmoorjustly asked with a young fellow who wont shoot and who wontfish and who wont hunt and who wont even play lansquenet</s> such a case was clearly hopeless</s>  he would have liked to see moreof miss merivale little lady sybils governess for there were threechildren in the family but miss merivale was a timid sensitivegirl and she did not often encourage his advances lest my ladyshould say she was setting her cap at the tutor</s>  the consequencewas that he was necessarily thrown much upon lady hildas societyand as lady hilda was laudably eager to instruct him in billiardslawn tennis and sketching he rapidly grew to be quite an adept atthose relatively moral and innocuous amusements under her constantinstruction and supervision</s> it seems to me said that acute observer lord lynmouth to hisspecial friend and confidante the ladysmaid that hilda makesa doocid sight too free with that fellow le breton</s>  dont you thinkso euphemia</s> i should hope my lord euphemia answered demurely that ladyhilda would know her own place too well to demean herself with suchas your lordships tutor</s>  if i didnt feel sure of that i shouldhave to mention the matter seriously to my lady</s> nevertheless the ladysmaid immediately stored up a mental noteon the subject in the lasting tablets of her

 papa says lynmouth may goout troutfishing with him this afternoon</s>  come up with me to theclatter</s>  im going to sketch there</s> very well lady hilda if you want my criticism i dont mind ifi do</s>  let me carry your things its rather a pull up even foryou with your box and easel</s> hilda gave him her sketchbook and colours and they turned togetherup the cleave behind the castle</s> a clatter is a peculiar devonshire feature composed of long loosetumbled granite blocks piled in wild disorder along the narrow summitof a saddlebacked hill</s>  it differs from a tor in being less highand castellated as well as in its longer and narrower contour</s> ernest and hilda followed the rough path up through the gorseand heather to the top of the ridge and then scrambled over thegrey lichencovered rooks together to the big loganstone whoseevenlypoised and tilted mass crowned the actual summit</s>  the graniteblocks were very high and rather slippery in places for it wasrainy april weather so that ernest had to take his companionshand more than once in his to help her over the tallest boulders</s> it was a small delicate hand though hilda was a tall wellgrownwoman ungloved too for the sake of the sketching and hildadidnt seem by any means unwilling to accept ernests proffered helpthough if it had been lord connemara who was with her instead shewould have scorned assistance and scaled the great mossy massesby herself like a mountain antelope</s>  lightfooted and lithe oflimb was lady hilda as befitted a devonshire lass accustomed tofollowing the exmoor staghounds across their wild country on herown hunter</s>  yet she seemed to find a great deal of difficulty inclambering up the clatter on that particular april morning andmove than once ernest half fancied to himself that she leaned on hisarm longer than was absolutely necessary for support or assistanceover the stiffest places</s> here by the logan mr</s>  le breton she said motioning him whereto put her campstool and papers</s>  thats a good point of viewfor the rocks yonder</s>  you can lie down on the rug and give me thebenefit of your advice and assistance</s> my advice is not worth taking said ernest</s>  im a regular dufferat painting and sketching</s>  you should ask lord connemara</s>  he knowsall about art and that sort of thing</s> lord connemara</s>  echoed hilda contemptuously</s>  he has a lot ofpictures in his gallery at home and hes been told by sensible menwhats the right thing for him to say about them but he knows nomore about art really than he knows about fiddlesticks</s> doesnt he indeed</s>  ernest answered languidly not feeling anyburning desire to discuss lord connemaras artistic attainments ordeficiencies</s> no he doesnt hilda went on rather defiantly as though ernesthad been lady exmoor and most of these people that come heredont either</s>  they have galleries and they get artists and peoplewho understand about pictures to talk with them and so they learnwhats considered the proper thing to say of each of them</s>  butas to saying anything spontaneous or original of their own about apicture or any other earthly thingwhy you know mr</s>  le bretonthey couldnt possibly do it to save their lives</s> well there i should think you do them as a class a greatinjustice said ernest quietly youre evidently prejudicedagainst your own people</s>  i should think that if theres any subjecton which our old families really do know anything its art</s>  lookat their great advantages</s> nonsense hilda answered decisively</s>  fiddlesticks for theiradvantages</s>  whats the good of advantages without a head on yourshoulders i should like to know</s>  and they havent got heads ontheir shoulders mr</s>  le breton you know they havent</s> why surely said ernest in his simple fashion looking thequestion straight in the face as a matter of abstract truth theremust be a great deal of ability among peers and peers sons</s>  allhistory shows it and it would be absurd if it werent so for themass of peers have got their peerages by conspicuous abilities ofone sort or another as barristers or soldiers or politiciansor diplomatists and they would naturally hand on their powers totheir different descendants</s> oh yes there are some of them with brains i suppose hildaanswered as one who makes a great concession</s>  theres herbertalderney whos member for somewhere or otherchurch stretton ithinkand makes speeches in the house hes clever they say butsuch a conceited fellow to talk to</s>  and theres wilfrid faunthorpwho writes poems and gets them printed in the magazines toobecause he knows the editors</s>  and theres randolph hastings whogoes in for painting and has little red and blue daubs at

onifeel sure at once hes an ordinary commoner not even honourableand he is invariably you may depend upon it</s> that would naturally happen on the average of instances ernestput in smiling considering the relative frequency of peersand commoners in this realm of england</s>  peers you know or evenhonourables are not common objects of the country numericallyspeaking</s> they are to me unfortunately hilda replied looking at himinquiringly</s>  i hardly ever meet anybody else you know and impositively bored to death by them and thats the truth really</s> its most unlucky under the circumstances that i should happento be the daughter of one peer and be offered promiscuously aswife to the highest bidder among half a dozen others if only iwould have them</s>  but i wont mr</s>  le breton i really wont</s>  imnot going to marry a fool just to please my mother</s>  nothing onearth would induce me to marry lord connemara for example</s> ernest looked at her and smiled but said nothing</s> lady hilda put in a stroke or two more to her pencil outline andthen continued her unsolicited confidences</s>  do you know mr</s>  lebreton she went on theres a conspiracythe usual conspiracybut still a regular conspiracy i call itbetween papa and mammato make me marry that stick of a connemara</s>  what is there in himi should like to know to make any girl admire or love

littleoriginality</s>  and whenever i hear papa and uncle sussex and lordconnemara talking at dinner it does seem to me too ridiculouslyabsurd that they should each have a separate voice in parliamentand that you shouldnt even have a fraction of a vote for a countymember</s>  what sort of superiority has lord connemara over you iwonder</s>  and she looked at ernest again with a searching glanceto see whether he was to be moved by such a personal and emphaticway of putting the matter</s> ernest looked back at her curiously in his serious simplicityand only answered there are a great many queer inequalities andabsurdities in all our existing political systems lady hilda</s> hilda smiled to herselfa quiet smile half of disappointmenthalf of complacent feminine superiority</s>  what a stupid fellow hewas in some ways after all</s>  even that silly lord connemara wouldhave guessed what she was driving at with only a quarter as muchencouragement</s>  but ernest must be too much afraid of the socialbarrier clearly so she began again this time upon a slightlydifferent but equally obvious tack</s> yes there are absurd inequalities really mr</s>  le breton veryabsurd inequalities</s>  youd get rid of them all i know</s>  you told methat about cutting all the landlords heads off im sure thoughyou said when i spoke about it before mamma the night you firstcame here that you didnt mean it</s>  i remember it perfectly wellbecause i recollect thinking at the time the idea was so charminglyand deliciously original</s> you must be quite mistaken lady hilda ernest answered calmly</s>  youmisunderstood my meaning</s>  i said i would get rid of landlordsbywhich i meant to say get rid of them as landlords not as individuals</s> i dont even know that id take away the land from them all at onceyou know though i dont think its justly theirs id deprivethem of it tentatively and gradually</s> well i cant see the justice of that im sure hilda answeredcarelessly</s>  either the lands ours by right or it isnt ours</s>  ifits ours you ought to leave it to us for ever and if it isntours you ought to take it away from us at once and make it overto the people to whom it properly belongs</s>  why on earth should youkeep them a day longer out of their own</s> ernest laughed heartily at this vehement and uncompromisingsansculottism</s>  youre a vigorous convert anyhow he said withsome amusement i see youve profited by my instruction</s>  youveput the question very plump and straightforward</s>  but in practice itwould be better no doubt gradually to educate out the landlordsrather than to dispossess them at one blow of what they honestlythough wrongly imagine to be their own</s>  let all existing holderskeep the land during their own lifetime and their heirs and resumeit for the nation after their lives allowing for the rights ofall children born of marriages between people now living</s> not at all hilda answered in a tone of supreme conviction</s>  imin favour of simply cutting our heads off once for all and makingour families pay all arrears of rent from the very beginning</s> that or nothing</s>  put the case another way</s>  suppose mr</s>  le bretonthere was somebody who had got a grant from a king a long time agoallowing him to hang any three persons he chose annually</s>  wellsuppose this person and his descendants went on for a great manygenerations extorting money out of other people by threatening tokill them and letting them off on payment of a ransom</s>  supposetoo they always killed three a year some time or other pourencourager les autresjust to show that they really meant it</s> well then if one day the people grew wise enough to inquire intothe right of these licensed extortioners to their black mail wouldyou say dont deprive them of it too unexpectedly</s>  let them keepit during their own lifetime</s>  let their children hang three of usannually after them</s>  but let us get rid of this fine old nationalcustom in the third generation</s>  would that be fair to the peoplewho would be hanged for the sake of old prescription in the intervaldo you think</s> ernest laughed again at the serious sincerity with which ehewas ready to acquiesce in his economical heresies</s>  youre quiteright he said the land is the peoples and theres no reasonon earth why they should starve a minute longer in order to letlord connemara pay three thousand guineas for spurious copies ofearly italian manuscripts</s>  and yet it would be difficult to getmost people to see it</s>  i fancy lady hilda you must really berather cleverer than most people</s> i score one thought hilda to herself and whatever happenswhether i marry a peer or a revolutionist i certainly wont marrya fool</s>  im glad you think so she went on aloud because iknow your opinions worth having</s>  i should like to be clever mr</s> le breton and i should like to know all about everything butwhat chance has one at dunbude</s>  do you know till you came here inever got any sensible conversation with anybody</s>  and she sighedgently as she put her head on one side to take a good view of hersketchy little picture</s>  lady hildas profile was certainly veryhandsome and she showed it to excellent advantage when she put herhead on one side</s>  ernest looked at her and thought so to himselfand lady hildas quick eye glancing sideways for a second fromthe paper noted immediately that he thought so</s> mr</s>  le breton she began again more confidentially than everone thing ive quite made up my mind to i wont be tied for lifeto a stick like lord connemara</s>  in fact i wont marry a man inthat position at all</s>  i shall choose for myself and marry a manfor the worth thats in him i assure you its a positive fact

angrybecause i wont have any of them but i wont</s>  i mean to wait andmarry whoever i choose as soon as i find a man i can really loveand honour</s> she paused and looked hard at ernest</s>  i cant speak much plainerthan that she thought to herself and really he must be stupiderthan the algies and the monties themselves if he doesnt see i wanthim to propose to me</s>  i suppose all women would say its awfullyunwomanly of me to lead up to his cards in this waythrowing myselfat his head theyd call it but what does that matter</s>  i wontmarry a fool and i will marry a man of some originality</s>  thatsthe only thing in the world worth troubling ones head about</s>  whyon earth doesnt he take my hand i wonder</s>  what further can hebe waiting for</s>  lady hilda was perfectly accustomed to the usualpreliminaries of a declaration and only awaited ernests firststep to proceed in due order to the second</s>  strange to say herheart was actually beating a little by anticipation</s>  it never evenoccurred to herthe belle of three seasonsthat possibly ernestmightnt wish to marry her</s>  so she sat looking pensively at herpicture and sighed again quietly</s> but ernest wholly unsuspicious only answered you will do quiteright lady hilda to marry the man of your own choice irrespectiveof wealth or station</s> hilda glanced up at him curiously with a halfdisdainful smileand was just on the point of saying but suppose the man of myown choice wont propose to me</s>  however as the words rose to herlips she felt there was a point at which even she should yieldto convention and there were plenty of opportunities still beforeher without displaying her whole hand too boldly and immediately</s> so she merely turned with another sigh this time a genuine one toher halfsketched outline</s>  i shall bring him round in time shesaid to herself blushing a little at her unexpected discomfiture</s> i shall bring him round in time i shall make him propose to me</s> i dont care if i have to live in a lodging with him and wash upmy own teathings i shall marry him that im resolved upon</s>  hesas mad as a march hare about his communism and his

take his hand to help me shethought blushing</s>  come and walk with me</s>  its no use trying todraw with ones hands freezing</s>  and she crumpled up the unfinishedsketch hastily between her fingers</s>  ernest jumped up to follow herand they spent the next hour scrambling up and down the clatterand talking on less dangerous subjects than lady hildas matrimonialaspirations</s> still i shall make him ask me yet lady hilda thought to herselfas she parted from him to go up and dress for dinner</s>  i shallmanage to marry him somehow or if i dont marry him at any rateill marry somebody

about his profession</s>  its one of thegriefs and troubles of my life</s>  he was a soldier and an indiansoldier too and if theres anything more certain to me than theprinciple that all fighting is

was to hersuch an odd and unexpected point of view</s>  but she felt instinctivelythat ernest really and deeply meant what he said and she knew shemust not allude to the subject again</s>  i beg your

no the guide answered with a tone of deep solemnity</s>  that isnot all</s>  the glacier went on moving moving slowly slowly butalways downward for years and years</s>  yet no one ever heard

unchangeableblue coat and brown velvet breeches of our own canton of thegraubunden</s>  we were very frightened about it and so we ran awaytrembling and told an old woman who lived close by her name

yawningand now i think wed better be getting under way again hadntwe oswald</s> harry oswald rose from his seat on the block of ice unwillingly andproceeded on his road up the mountain with a distinct and decidedfeeling of nervousness</s>  was it the guides story that made his kneestremble slightly</s>  was it his own inexperience in climbing</s>  or wasit the cold and the fatigue of the first ascent of the season toa man not yet in full pedestrian alpine training</s>  he did not feelat all sure about it in his own mind but this much he knew withperfect certainty that his footing was not nearly so secure underhim as it had been during the earlier part of the climb over thelower end of the glacier</s> byandby they reached the long sheer snowy slope near the threebrothers</s>  this slope is liable to slip and requires careful walkingso the guides began roping them together</s>  the stout monsieurin front next after me said the chief guide knotting the ropesoundly round herbert le breton then kaspar then you monsieurto harry oswald and finally paolo to bring up the rear</s>  thethin monsieur is nervous i think its best to place him most inthe middle</s> if you really are nervous oswald herbert said not unkindlyyoud better stop behind i think and let me go on with two of theguides</s>  the really hard work you know has scarcely begun yet</s> oh dear no harry answered lightly he didnt care to confesshis timidity before herbert le breton of all men in the world ido feel just a little groggy about the knees i admit but its notnervousness its only want of training</s>  i havent got accustomedto glacierwork yet and the best way to overcome it is by constantpractice</s>  solvitur ambulando you know as aldrich says aboutachilles and the tortoise</s> very good herbert answered drily only mind whatever you dofor heavens sake dont go and stumble and pull me down on the topof you</s>  its the clear duty of a good citizen to respect the livesof the other men who are roped together with him on the side of amountain</s> they set to work again in single file with cautious steps plantedfirmly on the treacherous snow to scale the great white slope thatstretched so temptingly before them</s>  harry felt his knees becomingat every step more and more ungovernable while herbert didntimprove matters by calling out to him from time to time now thenlook out for a hard bit here or mind that loose piece of icethere or be very careful how you put your foot down by the yieldingedge yonder and so forth</s>  at last they had almost reached thetop of the slope and were just above the bare gulley on the sidewhen harrys insecure footing on a stray scrap of ice gave waysuddenly and he begain to slip rapidly down the sheer slope ofthe mountain</s>  in a second he had knocked against paolo and paolohad begun to slip too so that both were pulling with all theirweight against kaspar and the others in front</s>  for heavens sakeman herbert cried hastily dig your alpenstock deep into thesnow</s>  at the same instant the chief guide shouted in roumanschto the same effect to kaspar</s>  but even as they spoke kasparpushing his feet hard against the snow began to give way too andthe whole party seemed about to slip together down over the sheerrocky precipice of the great gulley on the right</s>  it was a momentof supreme anxiety but herbert le breton looking back with bloodalmost unstirred and calmly observant eye saw at once the fullscope of the threatening danger</s>  theres only one chance hesaid to himself quietly</s>  oswald is lost already</s>  unless the ropebreaks we are all lost together</s>  at that very second harry oswaldthrowing his arms up wildly had reached the edge of the terribleprecipice he went over with a piercing cry into the abyss withthe last guide beside him and kaspar following him close in muteterror</s>  then herbert le breton felt the rope straining strainingstraining upon the sharp frozen edge of the rock for an inappreciablepoint of time it strained and crackled one loud snap and it wasgone for ever</s>  herbert and the chief guide almost upset by thesudden release from the heavy pull that was steadily dragging themover threw themselves flat on their faces in the drifted snowand checked their fall by a powerful muscular effort</s>  the ropewas broken and their lives were saved but what had become of thethree others</s> they crept cautiously on hands and knees to the most practicablespot at the edge of the precipice and the guide peered over intothe great white blank below with eager eyes of horrid premonition</s> as he did so he recoiled with awe and made a rapid gesture withhis hands half prayer half speechless terror</s>  what do you see</s> asked herbert not daring himself to look down upon the blankbeneath him lest he should be tempted to throw himself over in agiddy moment</s> jesu maria cried the guide crossing himself instinctivelyover and over again they have all fallen to the very foot of thesecond precipice</s>  they are lying all three huddled together onthe ledge there just above the great glacier</s>  they are dead quitedead dead before they reached the ground

danger was over now and he had at oncerecovered his usual philosophic equanimity</s>  quite dead he saidin french quite dead are they</s>  then we cant be of any furtheruse to them</s>  but i suppose we must go down again at once to helprecover the dead bodies</s> the guide gazed at him blankly with simple openmouthed undisguisedamazement</s>  naturally he said in a very quiet voice of utterdisgust and loathing</s>  you wouldnt leave them lying there aloneon the cold snow would you</s> this is really most annoying thought herbert le breton to himselfin his rational philosophic fashion here we are almost at thesummit and now we shall have to turn back again from the verythreshold of our goal without having seen the view for which weveclimbed up and risked our lives tooall for a purely sentimentalreason because we wont leave those three dead men alone on thesnow for an hour or two longer</s>  its a very short climb to thetop now and i could manage it by myself in twenty minutes</s>  ifonly the chief guide had slid over with the others i should havegone on alone and had the view at least for my trouble</s>  i couldhave pretended the accident happened on the way down again</s>  as itis i shall have to turn back ingloriously re infecta</s>  the guidewill tell everybody at pontresina that i went on in spite of theaccident and then it would get into the english

over such a precipiceas that without being killed a dozen times over before he evenreached the bottom</s>  a very painless and easy death too i couldntmyself wish for a better one</s>  we cant do them

pretty little sister of histoo but whats the use of bothering about it</s>  the things doneand nothing that i can do or say will ever make it any better</s> so they turned once more in single file down by the great glacierand retraced their way to pontresina without exchanging another word</s> to say the truth the chief guide felt appalled and frightened bythe presence of this impassive unemotional british traveller anddid not even care to conceal his feelings</s>  but then he wasnt aneducated philosopher and man of culture like herbert le breton</s> late that evening a party of twelve villagers brought back threestiff and mangled corpses on loose cattle hurdles into the villageof pontresina</s>  two of them were the bodies of two local swiss guidesand the third with its

probability that a cause ofdispute might arise between her father and ernest and had madeup her mind as far as in her lay to prevent its ever coming to ahead</s>  she didnt wish ernest to leave his post in the householdsomuch originality was hardly again to be secured in a hurryandtherefore she laid herself out with all her ingenuity to smoothover all the possible openings for a difference of

to talk overher mother quietly to acquiesce in ernests view of the question</s> if lord exmoor was beginning to think that this young mans confoundedfads were really getting quite unbearable lady hilda interposedsome casual remark about how much better lynmouth was kept out ofthe way now than he used to be in mr</s>  walshs time</s>  ernest himselfnever even suspected this unobtrusive

fortnight ernest remained at the red lion thoughpainfully conscious that he was sadly wasting his little reserve offunds from his late tutorship in order to find out exactly whatthe oswalds position

conversation</s>  very delicate and sweet and refined that tinygirlish face and figure looked in the plain unostentatious blackand white of her great sorrow and ernest felt as he walked alongby her side that she seemed to lean upon him naturally now theloss of her main support and chief advisor in life seemed to drawher closer and closer every day to her one remaining prop and futurehusband</s>

youd naturally rather wait a little longer beforediscussing them i wish for both our sakes we could have deferredit but time presses and im afraid from what i hear in the villagethat things wont go on

people consider quite welleducated enough to teachtheir daughters</s>  after all the daughters themselves are only womentoo you see ernest and dont expect more than a smattering ofbookknowledge and a few showy fashionable accomplishments</s> my dear edie ernest answered smiling at her gently in spiteof her tearful earnestness you quite misunderstand me</s>  it wasntthat i was thinking of at all</s>  there are very few governesses andvery few women anywhere who have half the knowledge and accomplishmentsand literary taste and artistic culture that you have very fewwho have had the advantage of associating daily with such a man aspoor harry and if you really wanted to get a place of the sortthe mere fact that youre harrys sister and that he interestedhimself in superintending your education ought by itself toensure your getting a very good one</s>  but what i meant was ratherthisi couldnt endure to think that you should be put to all thepetty slights and small humiliations

exposeyourself to it</s> to say the truth at that moment there rose very vividly beforeernests eyes the picture of poor shy miss merivale the governessat dunbude to little lady sybil lynmouths younger sister</s>  missmerivale was a rectors daughteran orphan and a very nice girlin her way and ernest had often thought to himself while he livedat the exmoors with just the slightest turn of fortunes wheelthat might be my own edie</s>  now for himself he had never felt anysense of social inferiority at all at dunbude he was an oxfordman and by the ordinary courtesy of english society he was alwaystreated accordingly in every way as an equal</s>  but there weregalling distinctions made in miss merivales case which he couldnot think of even at the time without a blush of ingenuous shameand which he did not like now even to mention to pretty shrinkingeager little edie</s>  one thing alone was enough to make his cheeks burnwhenever he thought of ita little thing and yet how unendurable</s> miss merivale lunched with the family and with her pupil in themiddle of the day but she did not dine with them in the evening</s> she had tea by herself instead in lady sybils little schoolroom</s> many a time when ernest had been out walking with her on theterrace just before dinner and the dressinggong sounded he hadfelt almost too ashamed to go in at the summons and leave the poorlittle governess out there alone with her social disabilities</s> the gong seemed to raise such a hideous artificial barrier betweenhimself and that delicatelybred sensitive cultivated englishlady</s>  that edie should be subjected to such a life of affronts asthat was simply unendurable</s>  true there are social distinctionsof the sort which even ernest le breton communist as he wascould not practically get over but then they were distinctionsfamiliarised to the sufferers from childhood upward and so perhapsa little less insupportable</s>  but that harry oswalds sisterthatedie his own precious delicate little edie a dainty englishwildflower of the tenderest should be transplanted from her ownappreciative home to such a chilly and ungenial soil as thatthevery idea of it was horribly unspeakable</s> but ernest edie answered breaking in upon his bitter meditationi assure you i wouldnt mind it a bit</s>  i knowits very dreadfulbut thenand here she blushed one of her pretty apologetic littleblushesyou know im used to it</s>  people in business always are</s> they expect to be treated just like servantnow that i know youllsay is itself a piece of hubris the

anything to say to the spongesof commerce</s>  im sure nobody i could meet in a governesss placecould possibly be worse in that respect than poor old miss catherineluttrell</s> that may be true edie

 i dont suppose anyof our friends or neighbours in calcombe spend nearly as much astwo hundred a year upon their own families</s> ah yes they do darling</s>  but that isnt the only thing</s>  twohundred a year is a very different matter in quiet oldworldlittle calcombe and in a fashionable modern wateringplace likepilbury regis</s>  we shall have to live in lodgings edie and livevery

if youll allow me to make a suggestion in thematter it would be that you and mrs</s>  le breton should take seatsfor the present at least at st</s>  marthas</s>  the parish church is highdecidedly

at charltoncollege where the doctor was an assistant for some years beforewe came to pilbury there was one of the undermasters a young manof very good family who took such an interest in the place

service well donethe kind of thing thatll be of use to theschool and have an excellent moral effect upon the boys in theway of religious training</s> no doubt ernest answered evasively youll soon manage to raisethe money in such a place as pilbury</s> no doubt the doctor replied looking at him with a searchingglance and evidently harbouring an uncomfortable suspicionalready that this young man had not got the moral and religiouswelfare of the boys quite so deeply at heart as was desirable ina model junior assistant master</s>  well well we shall see you atschool tomorrow morning le breton

do our best with him</s> oh of course mrs</s>  greatrex replied languidly but im boundto say im sure itll prove a very thankless piece of duty</s>  youngmen of his sort have never any proper sense of gratitude</s> meanwhile edie in the little lodgings in a side street near theschoolhouse had run out quickly to open the door for ernest andwaited anxiously to hear his report upon their new employers</s> well ernest dear she asked with something of the old childishbrightness in her eager manner and what do you think of them</s> why edie ernest answered kissing her white forehead gentlyi dont want to judge them too hastily but im inclined tofancy on first sight that both the doctor and his wife are mostegregious and unmitigated humbugs</s> humbugs ernest</s>  why how do you mean</s> well edie theyve got the moral and religious welfare of theboys at their very finger ends and do you knowi dont want tobe uncharitablebut i somehow imagine they havent got it at heartas well</s>  however we must do our best and try to fall in withthem</s> and for a whole year ernest and edie did try to fall in with themto the best of their ability</s>  it was hard work for though thedoctor

and seemed much astonishedwhen instead of kissing her as was his wont he only shook herhand somewhat coolly</s>  but she thought to herself that probablyhe didnt wish to be too demonstrative before

went on kindly after a minute i reallydo like you and sympathise with you</s>  but what am i to do afterthis</s>  i cant keep you at the school any longer can i now</s>
 i putit to your own commonsense</s>  im afraid le bretonit gives mesincere pain to say sobut im afraid we must part at the end ofthe quarter</s> ernest only muttered that he was very sorry</s> but what are we to do about it le breton</s>

violent fit of coughing</s>  he knew what the tastewas well enough and he mentioned the matter casually to edie alittle later in the morning</s>  edie was naturally frightened at thesymptoms and made him go to see the school doctor</s>  the doctor felthis pulse attentively listened with his stethoscope at the chestpunched and pummelled the patient all over in the most orthodoxfashion and asked the

call consumption</s> ernest went home with edie comforting her all the way as well ashe was able and trying to make light of it but feeling in his ownheart that the lookout was decidedly beginning to gather blackerand darker than ever before them</s>  through the rest of that termhe worked as well as he could but edie noticed every morning thatthe cough was getting worse and worse and long before the timecame for them to leave pilbury he had begun to look distinctlydelicate</s>  care for edie and for the future was telling on him hisframe had never been very robust and the anxieties of the

about for somethingor other that ernest could turn his hand to and writing letterswith indefatigable kindness to all his colleagues and correspondentsfor though he was as ernest said a most

across him he had found in a tobacconists window somethingto write about</s>  your practised journalist doesnt need to think atall he writes whatever comes uppermost without the

would it be a successor a failure</s>  that was the question they were both every momentintently asking themselves</s>  it was not a very important pieceof literary workmanship to be sure only a social leader for anewspaper to be carelessly skimmed today and used to light thefire tomorrow if even that and yet had it been the greatestmasterpiece ever produced by the human intellect ernest could nothave worked at it with more conscientious care or edie watchedhim with profounder admiration</s>  when shakespeare sat down to writehamlet it may be confidently asserted that neither mistress

interlined with interminable additions and correctionsedieventured for a moment briefly to interrupt his creative efforts</s> dont you think youve written as much as makes an ordinary leadernow ernest</s>  she asked apologetically</s>  im afraid youre makingit a good deal longer than it ought to be by rights</s> im sure i dont know edie ernest answered gazing at the twolaboured sheets with infinite dubitation and searching of spirit</s> i suppose one ought properly to count the words in an averageleader and make it the same length as they always are in themorning intelligence</s>  i think they generally run to just a column</s> of course you ought dear edie answered</s>  run out this minuteand buy one before you go a single line further</s> ernest looked back at his two pages of foolscap somewhat ruefully</s> thats a dreadful bore he said with a sigh itll just runaway with the whole penny i thought id managed to save in gettingthe second quality of foolscap for fivepence</s>  however i supposeit cant be helped and after all if the thing succeeds one canlook upon the penny in the light of an investment</s>  its throwinga sprat to catch a whale as the proverb says though im afraidherr max would say that that was a very immoral capitalist proverb</s> how horribly low we must be sinking edie when we come to use theantisocial language of those dreadful capitalists</s> i dont think capitalists deal much in proverbs dear said ediesmiling in spite of herself but you neednt go to the expenseof buying a morning intelligence i dare say for perhaps mrs</s> halliss may have

ill just run down to the kitchen this minuteand ask her</s> in a few seconds edie returned in triumph with an old soiled andtorn copy of the morning intelligence duly procured by theingenious mrs</s>  halliss from the dairy opposite</s>  it was a decidedlyantiquated copy and it had only too obviously been employed byits late possessor to wrap up a couple of kippered herrings butit was still entire so far as regarded the leaders at least andit was perfectly legible in spite of its ancient and fishlikesmell</s>  to ensure accuracy ernest and edie took a leader apiece andcarefully counted up the number of words that went to the column</s> they came on an average to fifteen hundred</s>  then ernest countedhis own manuscript with equal careno easy task when one tookinto consideration the interlined or erased passagesand to hisinfinite disgust discovered that it only extended to seven hundredand fifty words</s>  why edie he said in a very disappointedtone how little it prints into</s>  i should certainly have thoughtid written at least a whole column</s>  and the worst of it is ibelieve ive really said all i have to say about the subject</s> what is it ernest dear</s>  asked edie</s> italian organboys ernest answered</s>  i saw on a placard inthe news shop that one of them had been taken to a hospital in astarving condition</s>  he hardly liked to tell even edie that he hadstood for ten minutes at a tobacconists window and read the casein a sheet of lloyds news conspicuously hung up there for publicperusal</s> well let me hear what you have written ernest dear and thensee if you couldnt expand it</s> ernest read it over most seriously and solemnlyit was only asocial leader of the ordinary commonplace talkytalky sort butto those two poor young people it was a very serious and solemnmatter indeedno less a matter than their own two lives and littledots into the bargain</s>  it began with the particular case of theparticular organboy who formed the peg on which the whole articlewas to be hung it went on to discourse on the lives and mannersof organboys in general it digressed into the natural history ofthe common guineapig with an excursus on the scenery of the lowerapennines and</s>  it finished off with sundry abstract observationson the musical aspect of the barrelorgan and the aesthetic value ofhurdygurdy performances</s>  edie listened to it all with deep attention</s> its very good ernest dear she said with wifely admirationas soon as he had finished</s>  just like a real leader exactly onlydo you know there arent any anecdotes in it</s>  i think a socialleader of that sort ought always to have a lot of anecdotes</s>  couldntyou manage to bring in something about fox and sheridan or aboutgeorge iv</s>  and beau brummel</s>  they always do you know in most ofthe papers</s> ernest gazed at her in silent admiration</s>  how clever of you ediehe said to think of that</s>  why of course there ought to be someanecdotes</s>  theyre the very breath of life to this sort of meaninglesswriting</s>  only somehow george iv</s>  and beau brummel dont seemexactly relevant to italian organgrinders now do they</s> i thought said edie with hardly a touch of unintentional satirethat the best thing about anecdotes of that kind in a newspaperwas their utter irrelevancy</s>  but if beau brummel wont do couldntyou manage to work in guicciardini and the galleys</s>  thats strictlyitalian you know and therefore relevant and im sure the newspaperleaders are extremely fond of that story about guiccardini</s> they are ernest answeredmost undoubtedly but perhaps for thatvery reason readers may be beginning to get just a little tired ofit by this time</s> i dont think the readers matter much said edie with abrilliant flash of practical commonsense at least not nearlyhalf as much ernest as the editor</s> quite true ernest replied with another admiring look butprobably the editor more or less consults the taste and feelingsof the readers</s>  well ill try to expand it a bit and ill manageto drag in an anecdote or two somehowif not guicciardini atleast something or other else italian</s>  you see italys a tolerablyrich subject because you can do any amount about raffael and michaelangelo and leonardo and so forth not to mention botticelli</s>  thepapers have made a dreadful run lately on botticelli</s> so ernest sat down once more at the table by the window and beganto interlard the manuscript with such allusions to italy and theitalians as could suggest themselves on the spur of the moment tohis anxious imagination</s>  at the end of half an hourabout thetime a practised hand would have occupied in writing the wholearticlehe counted words once more and found there were stilltwo hundred wanting</s>  two hundred more words to say about italianorganboys</s>  alas for the untrained human fancy</s>  a master leaderwriter at the office of the morning intelligence could have runon for ever on so fertile and suggestive a themea theme pregnantwith unlimited openings for all the cheap commonplaces of abstractjournalistic philanthropy but poor ernest a prentice hand at thetrade had yet to learn the fluent trick of the accomplished newspurveyor he absolutely could not write without thinking aboutit</s>  a third time he was obliged to recommit his manuscript and athird time to count the words over</s>  this time oh joy the reckoningcame out as close as possible to the even fifteen hundred</s>  ernestgave a sigh of relief and turned to read it all over againas finally enlarged and amended to the critical ears of admiringedie</s> there was anecdote enough now in all conscience in the articleand allusions enough to stock a whole weeks numbers of the morningintelligence</s>  edie listened to the whole tirade with an air ofthe most severe and impartial criticism</s>  when ernest had finishedshe rose up and kissed him</s>  im sure itll do ernest she saidconfidently</s>  its exactly like a real leader</s>  its quite beautifulagreat deal more beautiful in fact than anything else i ever readin a newspaper its good enough to print in a volume</s> i hope the editorll think so ernest answered dubiously</s>  ifnot what a lot of valuable tenpenny foolscap wasted all for nothing</s> now i must write it all out again clean edie on fresh pieces</s> newspaper men it must be candidly admitted do not usually writetheir articles twice over indeed to judge by the result it maybe charitably believed that they do not even as a rule read themthrough when written to correct their frequent accidental slipsof logic or english but ernest wrote out his organboy leader inhis most legible and roundest hand copperplate fashion with asmuch care and precision as if it were his first copy for presentationto the stern writingmaster of a draconian board school</s>  editorsare more likely to read your manuscript if its legible i shouldthink edie he said looking up at her with more of hope in hisface than had often been seen in it of late</s>  i wonder now whetherthey prefer it sent in a long envelope folded in three or in asquare envelope folded twice over or in a paper cover open likea pamphlet</s>  there must be some recognised professional way of doingit and i should think ones more likely to get it taken if onesends it in the regular professional fashion than if one makesit look too amateurish</s>  i shall go in for the long envelope atany rate if not journalistic its at least official</s> the editor of the morning intelligence is an important personagein contemporary politics and a man of more real weight in theworld than halfadozen members of parliament for obscure countryboroughs but even that mighty man himself would probably have beena little surprised as well as amused if he could have seen it atthe way in which ernest and edie le breton anxiously endeavouredto conciliate beforehand his merest possible personal fads andfancies</s>  as a matter of fact the question of the particular paperon which the article was written mattered to him absolutely lessthan nothing inasmuch as he never looked at anything whatsoeveruntil it had been set up in type for him to pass offhand judgmentupon its faults or its merits</s>  his time was far too valuable to belightly wasted on the task of deciphering crabbed manuscript</s> in the afternoon berkeley called to see whether ernest had followedhis suggestion and was agreeably surprised to find a whole articlealready finished</s>  he glanced through the neatly written pages andwas still more pleased to discover that ernest with an unsuspectedoutburst of practicality and practicability had really hit upona possible subject</s>  this may do ernest he said with a sigh ofrelief</s>  i dare say it will</s>  i know lancaster wants leader writersand i think this is quite good enough to serve his turn</s>  ivespoken to him about you come round with me nowhell be at theoffice by four oclockand well see what we can do for you</s>  itsabsolutely useless sending anything to the editor of a daily paperwithout an introduction</s>  you might write with the pen of the angelgabriel or

junius and montesquieu into the waste paperbasket and accept copy on the shocking murder in the boroughroad from one of his regular contributors instead</s>  he cant helphimself and what you must do ernest is to become one of theregular ring and combine to keep junius and montesquieu permanentlyoutside</s> the struggle for existence gives no quarter ernest said sadlywith half a sigh</s> and takes none berkeley answered quickly</s>  so for your wifessake you must try your best to fight your way through it on yourown account for yourself and your family</s> the editor of the morning intelligence mr</s>  hugh lancaster wasa short thickset hardheaded sort of man with a kindly twinklein his keen grey eyes and a harassed smile playing continuallyaround the corners of his firm and dose mouth</s>  he looked as thoughhe was naturally a goodhumoured benevolent person overdrivenat the journalistic mill till half the life was worn out of himleaving the benevolence as a wearied remnant without energyenough to express itself in any other fashion than by the perpetualharassed smile</s>  he saw arthur berkeley and ernest le breton at oncein his own sanctum and took the manuscript from their

there is always a strong tendency to criticisea little severely the second work of a successful beginner peoplelike to assume a knowing air and to murmur selfcomplacently thatthey felt sure from the beginning he couldnt keep up permanentlyto his first level</s>  but in spite of that natural tendency of theunregenerate human mind and in spite too of a marked politicalbias on the authors part the duke of bermondsey took the townby storm almost as completely as the primate of fiji had done beforeit</s>  everybody said that though the principles of the piece werereally quite atrocious when one came to think of them seriouslyyet the music and the dialogue were crisp and brisk enough to floatany amount of social or economical heresy that that clever youngman mr</s>  arthur berkeley might choose to put into one of hisamusing and original operas</s> the social and economical heresies of course were partly dueto ernest le bretons insidious influence</s>  at the same time thatberkeley was engaged in partially converting ernest ernest wasengaged in the counter process of partially converting berkeley</s> to say the truth the conversion was not a very difficult matterto effect the neophyte had in him implicitly already the chiefsaving doctrines of the socialistic faith or if one must put itconversely the germs of the disease were constitutionally implantedin his system and only needed a little external encouragementto cring the poison out fully in the most virulent form of thecomplaint</s>  the great point of the duke of bermondsey consisted inthe ridiculous contrast it exhibited between the wealth dignityand selfimportance of the duke himself and the squalid miserableshrinking poverty of the eastend purlieus from which he drew hisenormous revenues</s>  ernest knew a little about the eastend frompractical experience he had gone there often with ronald on hisrounds of mercy and had seen with his own eyes those dens of miserywhich most people have only heard or read about</s>  it was ernest whohad suggested this light satirical treatment of the great socialproblem whose more serious side he himself had learnt to lookat in max schurzs revolutionary salon and it was to ernest thatarthur berkeley owed the first hint of that famous scene where theyoung countess of coalbrookdale converses familiarly on the naturalbeauties of healthful labour with the chorus of intelligent collieryhands in the most realistic of grimy costumes from her fathersestates in staffordshire</s>  the stalls hardly knew whether to laughor frown when the intelligent colliers respectfully invited thecountess in her best ascot flounces and furbelows to enjoy thelauded delights of healthful mine labour in propri person butthey quite recovered their good humour when the band

into the eastend gave him something comparativelyfresh to write about and though he was compelled to conceal his ownsentiments upon many points in order to conform to that impersonalconscience the policy of the paper he was still able to dealwith subjects that really interested him and in which he fanciedhe might actually be doing a little good</s>  a few days after he hadtaken seriously to the

kitchen at herdaily preparations with tears trickling slowly down both her hardred cheeks in her own motherly fashion</s> so from that time forth ernest had the small sittingroom entirelyto himself whenever he was engaged in his literary labours whileedie and dot turned the front bedroom on the first floor intoa neat and commodious nursery</s>  as other work did not turn up sorapidly as might have been expected and as ernest grew tired aftera while of writing magazine articles on the great social problemwhich were invariably declined with thanks so promptly as to leadto a wellfounded suspicion that they had never even been opened bythe editor he determined to employ his spare time in the productionof an important economical volume a treatise on the ultimate ethicsof a labouring community to be entitled the final rule of socialright living</s>  this valuable economical work he continued to toilat for many months in the intervals of his other occupations andwhen at last it was duly completed he read it over at full lengthto dear little edie who considered it one of the most profoundlylogical and convincing political treatises ever written</s>  the variousleading firms however to whom it was afterwards submitted witha view to publication would appear oddly enough to have doubtedits complete suitability to the tastes and demands of the readingpublic in the present century for they invariably replied to ernestsinquiries that they would be happy to undertake its productionfor the trilling sum of one hundred guineas payable in advancebut that they did not see their way to accepting the risk andresponsibility of floating so speculative a volume on their ownaccount</s>  in the end the unhappy manuscript after many refusalswas converted into cockboats hats and paper dollies for littledot and its various intermediate reverses need enter no furtherinto the main thread of this history</s>  it kept ernest busy in thespare hours of several months and prevented him from thinking toomuch of his own immediate prospects in his dreams for the goldenfuture of humanity and insomuch it did actually subserve someindirectly useful function but on the other hand it wasted aconsiderable quantity of valuable tenpenny foolscap and providedhim after all with one more severe disappointment to put on top ofall the others to which he was just then being subjected</s>  clearlythe reading public took no paying interest in political economy orif they did then the article practically affected by the eternallaws of supply and demand was at least not the one meted out tothem from the enthusiastic schurzian pen of ernest le breton</s> one afternoon not long after ernest and edie had taken rooms atmrs</s>  hallisss they were somewhat surprised at receiving the honourof a casual visit from a very unexpected and unusual quarter</s>  ronaldwas with them talking earnestly over the prospects of the situationwhen a knock came at the door and to their great astonishmentthe knock was quickly followed by the entrance of herbert</s>  he hadnever been there before and ernest felt sure he had come now forsome very definite and sufficient

his own fashion had his</s> ernest was after all a good fellow enough at bottom and his ownbrother a man cant for very rospectabilitys sake let his ownbrother go utterly to the dogs if he can possibly help it and soherbert had made up his mind much against his natural inclinationto warn ernest of the danger he incurred in having anything moreto do or say with this insane disreputable old schurz fellow</s>  forhis own part he hated giving advice people never took it and thatwas a deadly offence against his amour propre and a gross insult tohis personal dignity but still in this case for ernests sakehe determined after an inward struggle to swallow his own privatescruples and make an effort to check his brother on the edge ofthe abyss</s>  not that he would come to the point at once herbertwas a careful diplomatic agent and he didnt spoil his handby displaying all his cards too openly at the outset he wouldbegin upon comparatively indifferent subjects and lead round theconversation gradually to the perils and errors of pure schurzianism</s> so he set out by admiring his nieces fat armsa remarkable stretchof kindliness on herberts part for of course other peoples babiesare well known to be really the most uninteresting objects in thewhole animate universeand then he passed on by natural transitionsto ernests housekeeping arrangements and to the prospects ofjournalism as a trade and finally to the necessity for a journalistto consult the tastes of his reading public</s>  and by the wayernest he said quietly at last of course after this row atpilbury

yourself admit mrs</s>  le breton that its an awkward thingto be mixed up with people who are tried on a criminal charge forinciting to murder</s>  of course we all allow that the czars a verydespotic and autocratic sovereign that his existence is an anomalyand that the desire to blow him up is a very natural desire forevery intelligent russian to harbour privately in the solitude ofhis own bosom</s>  if we were russians ourselves no doubt wed try toblow him up too if we could conveniently do so without detection</s> so much every rational englishman who isnt blinded by prejudiceor frightened by the mere sound of words must at once franklyacknowledge</s>  but unfortunately you see the mass of englishmenare blinded by prejudice and are frightened by the mere soundof words</s>  to them blowing up a czar is murder though of courseblowing up any number of our own black people isnt and incitingto blow up the czar or doing what seems to most englishmenequivalent to such incitement as for example saying in printthat the czars government isnt quite ideally perfect and oughtgradually and tentatively to be abolishedwhy that i sayis a criminal offence and is naturally punishable by a term ofimprisonment</s>  now is it worth while to mix oneself up with peoplelike that ernest when you can just as easily do without havinganything on earth to say to them</s> edies face burnt scarlet as she listened but ernest only answeredmore quietlyhe never allowed anything that herbert said to disturbhis equanimitywe dont think alike upon this subject you knowherbert and im afraid the disagreement is fundamental</s>  it doesntmatter so much to us what the world thinks as what is abstractlyright and edie would prefer to cling to herr schurz through goodreport and evil report rather than to be applauded by your massof englishmen for having nothing to do with inciting to murder</s>  weknow that herr max never did anything of the kind that he is thegentlest and best of men and that in russian affairs he has alwaysbeen on the side of the more merciful methods as against thosewho would have meted out to the czar the harsher measure of purejustice</s> well herbert answered bravely with a virtuous determination notto be angry at this open insult to his own opinion but to perseverein his friendly efforts for his brothers sake we wont take herrmax into consideration at all but will look merely at the generalquestion</s>  the fact is ernest youve chosen the wrong side</s>  theenvironment is too strong for you and if you set yourself up againstit itll crush you between the

necessary first particular</s> if i fail ernest answered with a heavy heart i can only dieonce and after all every man can do no more than till to the bestof his ability the niche in nature that he finds already cut outfor him by circumstances</s> my dear ernest herbert continued quietly twisting himselfa cigarette with placid deliberateness as a preliminary to hisdeparture your great mistake in life is that you will persist inconsidering the universe as a cosmos</s>  now the fact is it isnta cosmos its a chaos and a very poor one at that</s> ah yes ernest answered gravely nobody recognises

but i dont feel called upon to make myself the martyr ofthe cause of readjustment for all that</s>  if i were a working mani should take up the side that youre taking up now i should haveeverything to

older and more fatherly man about it or tosome kind lady</s>  if so i have many good friends in london who wouldlisten to you with as much interest and attention as i should</s> the old spirit flared up in selah for a second as she answeredquickly no no sir its nothing of that sort</s>  i can tell youas well as i can tell anybody</s>  if ive been unfortunate its beenthrough no fault of my own

leads oneoccasionally for a time into mistaken inferences</s>  let me hear allyour history please and i firmly believe through the aid thatnever forsakes us i shall be able to do something or other to helpyou in your difficulties</s> thus adjured selah began and told her whole unhappy historythrough without pause or break into ronalds quietly sympatheticear</s>  she told him quite frankly and fully how she had picked upthe acquaintance of a young mr</s>  walters from oxford at hastingshow this mr</s>  walters had led her to believe he would marry herhow she had left her home hurriedly under the

thefull measure of her troubles and trials from her methodist friendsat hastings</s>  ronald shook his head sympathetically at this stageof the story</s>  ah i know i know he muttered half under

assent</s> will you allow me to offer you a little lunch</s>  he asked hesitatinglywith something of herberts stately politeness</s>  even in this lastextremity ronald felt instinctively what was due

thought withan inward smile of the very different way in which her friends athastings would have discussed the spiritual character of a wickedsecularist</s>
just at that moment a latchkey turned lightly in the street doorand two sets of footsteps came down the passage to lady le bretonslittle back breakfastroom</s>  one set turned up the staircase theother halted for a second at the breakfastroom doorway</s>  then thedoor opened gently and herbert le breton and selah briggs stoodface to face again in blank astonishment</s> there was a moments

stood upright in front of ronaldwithout a word looking neither to the right nor to the left andwaiting eagerly for the story to be finished</s> when ronald had said his say lady le breton looked up at

by the unanimous clamour of thirtymillions of free working people to redress the gross injustice ofthe law in sending max sohurz the greatest noblest and purestmindedof mankind to a common felons

punishment</s>  flushed and feverishthough he was he rose straight up from the table handed thetelegram to edie without a word and started off alone to hail ahansom cab and drive down immediately to the office</s>  arthur berkeleyfearful of what might happen to him in his present excited statestole out after him quietly and followed him unperceived in anotherhansom at a little distance</s> when

unheardof circumstances when the whole laboriousfabric of british liberties was tottering visibly to its basebuthe wisely concluded to himself that the editor had to see articleswritten about every possible subject every eveningfrom a europeanconvulsion to a fire at a theatreand that use must have madeit in him a property of easiness</s>  when a mans obliged to workhimself up perpetually into a state of artificial excitement aboutevery railway accident explosion shipwreck earthquake or volcaniceruption in europe asia africa america and the islands of thepacific ocean why then ernest charitably said to himself hissympathies must naturally end by getting a trifle callous especiallywhen hes such a very apathetic person to start with as this laconiceditorial lancaster</s>  so he turned into the little bare box devotedto his temporary use and began writing with perfectly unexampledand extraordinary rapidity at his leader and his article about theinjured and martyred apostle of the slighted communistic religion</s> it was only a few months since ernest had with vast toil andforethought spun slowly out his maiden newspaper article on theitalian organboy and now he found himself to his own immensesurprise covering sheet after sheet of paper in feverish hastewith a long account of max schurzs splendid life and labours andwith a really fervid and eloquent appeal to the english people notto suffer such a man as he to go helplessly and hopelessly to anenglish prison at the bare bidding of a foreign despot</s>  he neverstopped for one moment to take thought or to correct what he hadwritten in the excitement of the moment his pen travelled alongover the paper as if inspired and he found the words and thoughtsthronging his brain almost faster than his lagging hand couldsuffice to give them visible embodiment</s>  as each page was thrownoff hurriedly he sent it down still pale and wet to the printersin the office and before two oclock in the morning he had fullproofs of all he had written sent up to him for final correction</s>  itwas a stirring and vigorous leader he felt quite certain himselfas he read it over and he thought with a swelling breast thatit would appear next day with all the impersonal authority ofthe morning intelligence stamped upon its face at ten thousandenglish breakfast tables where it might rouse the people in theirmillions

learn hes been at thebottom of half the revolutionary and insurrectionary movements ofthe last twenty yearsa regular outandout professional socialisticincendiary</s> you wouldnt say so berkeley replied quietly if youd seenmore of him lancaster</s>  but being a man of the world and havingcome mainly on ernests account he didnt care to press the abstractquestion of herr maxs political

political exilewho had abused the hospitality of a great fres country to concoctvile plots against the persons of friendly sovereigns and innocentministers on the european continent</s> ernest laid down the paper dreamily and leant back for a momentin his chair to let his brain recover a little from the reelingdizziness of that crushing disappointment</s>  then he turned in agiddy mechanical

all know how we all in englandlook upon the foreign political refugeea man to be hit again withimpunity because he has no friends but to ernest who had livedso long in his own little socialistic set

moredeepseated and undefinable than thatin a word his idiosyncrasy</s> selah briggs with her peculiar fiery soul and rebellious naturefound in both the le bretons something that seemed at once to satisfyher wants to fulfil her desires to saturate her affinities andwith ronald as with herbert before she was conscious of a certainawe and respect which was all the more pleasant to her becauseher untamed spirit had never felt anything like it with any otherhuman being</s>  she didnt understand them and she didnt want tounderstand them that constituted just the very charm of theirwhole

natural and imperceptible transference she passed onat last to ronalds account very much the same intensity of feelingthat she had formerly felt towards his brother herbert</s> but at the same time

lodgings ronald always made it an excuse for finding thema supper on the ground that selah was really his guest though hecould not conveniently ask her to his own rooms he walked hometowards notting

he looked so frail and gentle as he stood there pleading in thepale moonlight that selah could have taken him to her bosom thenand there and fondled him as one would pet a sick child for purewomanliness but the devil in her blood kept her from doing it andshe answered haughtily instead ronald if you wanted to marryme you ought to have asked me for my own sake</s>  now that youveasked me for anothers you cant expect me to give you an answer</s> keep your money my poor boy youll want it all for you and herhereafter dont go sharing it and spending it on perfect strangerssuch as

speak to you about a matterof duty and as a matter of duty strictly i regard it not as anyrelaxation of my just attitude of indignant expectancy towardsyourself no parent ought rightly to overlook such conduct asyours on the part of a son</s>  ronald inclined his head respectfully</s> well what ive come to speak to you about today ronald isabout your poor misguided brother ernest</s>  he too as you knowhas behaved very badly to me</s> no ronald answered stoutly without further note or comment</s> where the matter touched himself only he could maintain a decentsilence but where it touched poor dying ernest he couldnt possiblyrestrain himself even from a sense of filial obligation</s> very badly to me lady le breton went on sternly without in anyway noticing the brief interruption and i cant of course goto see him either especially not as i should by so doing exposemyself to meeting the person whom he has chosen to make his wife</s> still as i hear that ernest a in a very serious or even dangerousconditionhes dying ronald answered the quick tears once more findingthe easy road to his eyes as usual</s> i considered as a mother it was my duty to warn him to take alittle thought about his soul</s> his soul</s>  ronald exclaimed in astonishment</s>  ernests soul</s>  whymother dear ernest has no need to look after his soul</s>  he doesnttake that sordid petty limited view of our relations witheternity and of our relations with the infinite which makes themall consist of the miserable selfish squalid desire to save ourown poor personal little souls at all hazards</s>  ernest has somethingbetter and nobler to think of i can assure you than such a mereselfcentred idea as that</s> ronald</s>  lady breton exclaimed drawing herself up with muchdignity how on earth you who have always pretended to be areligious person can utter such a shocking and wicked sentimentas that really passes my comprehension</s>  what in the world isreligion for i should like to know if it isnt to teach us howto save our own souls</s>  but the particular thing i want to speakto you about is just this couldnt you manage to induce ernest tosee the archdeacon a little and let the archdeacon speak to himabout his deplorable spiritual condition</s>  i thought about you bothso much at church yesterday when the dear archdeacon was preachingsuch a beautiful sermon his text was like

save his life shall lose it</s> remember what is written not every one that saith unto me lordlord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven</s> but ronald lady le breton continued half angrily

finally fallen</s>  nowhilda tregellis was a kindhearted girl at bottom and when sheheard all about it she said at once to arthur i shall go andsee them myself tomorrow mr</s>  berkeley whether mamma allows meor not</s> what good will it do</s>  arthur had answered her quickly</s>  youcant find work for poor le breton can you</s>  and of course if youcant do that you can be of no earthly use in

theres no saying when one may happento turn up useful</s>  of course ive never been of the slightest useto anybody in all my life myself i know and i dare say i nevershall be but at least theres no

comfortably</s>  its a tragedyall the dramas of real lifealways are tragedies but im terribly afraid theres no conceivableway out of it</s> lady hilda only looked at him with bold good humour</s>  nonsenseshe said bravely</s>  all pure rubbishing pessimistic nonsense</s>  ihope pessimistics the right wordits a very good word anyhoweven if it isnt in the proper place</s>  well i dont agree with youat all about this question mr</s>  berkeley</s>  im very fond of mr</s>  lebreton really very fond of him and i believe theres a cornersomewhere for every man if only he can jog down properly into

offhim</s> but you cant cut them off thats the very trouble arthur answeredwith just a faint rising suspicion that he was half jealous of theinterest hilda showed even in poor lonely ernest le breton</s>  graciousheavens</s>  could he be playing false at last to the longcherishedmemory of little miss butterfly</s>  could he be really beginning tofall just a little in love after all with

perfectly well hildarejoined quickly</s>  i wouldnt care twopence for him if i thoughtyou could</s>  its the angles that give him all his charming deliciousoriginality</s>  but you can look out a square hole for him somewhereyou know and that of course would be a great deal better</s>  dependupon it mr</s>  berkeley there are square holes up and down in theworld if only we knew where to look for them and the mistakethat everybody has made in poor mr</s>  le bretons case has been thatinstead of finding one to suit him theyve gone on trying to pokehim down anyhow by main force into one of the round ones</s>  thatgoes against the grain you know besides which i call it a clearwaste of the very valuable solid mahogany corners</s> arthur berkeley looked at her silently for a moment as if a gleamof light had burst suddenly in upon him</s>  then he said to her slowlyand deliberately perhaps youre right lady hilda though i neverthought of it quite in that light before</s>  but one thing certainlystrikes me now and that is that youre a great deal cleverer afterall than i ever thought you</s> lady hilda made a little mock curtsey</s>  its very good of you tosay so she answered halfsaucily</s>  only the compliment is ratherdoubleedged you must confess because it implies that up to nowyouve had a dreadfully low opinion of my poor little intelligence</s> so after that conversation lady hilda made up her mind that shewould certainly go the very next day and call as soon as possibleupon edie le breton</s>  nobody could tell what good might possiblycome of it but at least there could come no harm</s>  and so when thecarriage drew up it the door at halfpast eleven hilda tregellisstepped into it with a vague consciousness of an important missionand ordered jenkins to drive at once to the side street in hollowaywhose address arthur berkeley had last night given her</s>  jenkinstouched his hat with mechanical respect but inwardly wondered whatthe dickens my lady

quickly that mrs</s> le breton was at home</s>  her womans eye detected at once the coroneton the carriage and she was ready to burst with delight when thetall visitor handed her a card for edie bearing the name of ladyhilda tregellis</s>  it was almost the first time that edie had hadany lady callers certainly the first time she had had any of suchsocial distinction and mrs</s>  halliss made haste to usher her up indue form and then ran down hastily to communicate the good newsto honest john who in his capacity of past coachman was alreadygazing out of the area window with deep interest at the carriageand horses</s> there john dear she cried with tears of joy in her eyesforgetting in her excitement to drat the man for not being in theback kitchen to think that we should see a

glad to ear itjohn that i am for i cant abear to see that dear young fellowaeatin is life out with care and anxiety</s>  and mrs</s>  halliss whohad always felt convinced in her own mind that ernest must reallybe the unacknowledged heir to a splendid fortune began to wipeher eyes violently in her delight at this evident realisation ofher wildest fancies and wishes</s> meanwhile upstairs in the little parlour edie had risen in sometrepidation as mrs</s>  halliss placed in her hands lady hilda tregellisscard</s>  ernest was out gone to walk feebly around the streets ofholloway and she hardly knew at first what to say to so unexpecteda visitor</s>  but lady hilda put her almost at her ease at onceby coming up to her with both her arms outstretched as to an oldfriend and saying with one of her pleasantest smilesyou must forgive me mrs</s>  le breton for never having come tocall on you before but i have been long meaning to and doubtingwhether you would care to see me or not</s>  you know im a very oldfriend of your husbandshe was so kind to me always when he wasdown at our place in dear old devonshire</s>  youre a devonshire girlyourself arent you</s>  just as i am</s>  i thought so</s>  im so glad ofit</s>  i always get on so well with the dear old devonshire folk</s> well ive been meaning to come for ever so long and puttingit off and putting it off and putting it off as one will putthings off you know when youre not quite sure about them untillast evening</s>  and then our friend mr</s>  arthur berkeley who knowseverybody talked to me about your husband and you and told mehe thought you wouldnt mind my coming to see you for he fanciedyou hadnt much society up here that you cared for or sympathisedwith though of course im dreadfully afraid of coming to callupon you because i know youre the sister of that very clever mr</s> oswald whose sad death we were all so sorry to hear about in thepapers and naturally as youve lived so much with him and withmr</s>  le breton you must be so awfully learned and all that sort ofthing and no doubt despise ignorant people like myself dreadfully</s> but you really mustnt despise me mrs</s>  le breton because yousee i havent had all the advantages that youve had indeed theonly clever people ive ever met in all my life are your husbandand mr</s>  arthur berkeley except of course cabinet ministers andso forth and they dont count because theyre political and sovery old and solemn and grand and wont take any notice of usgirls except to sit upon us</s>  so thats whats made me rather afraidto call upon you because i thought youd be quite too much inthe higher education way for a girl like me and i havent got anyeducation at all except in rubbish as your husband used alwaysto tell me</s>  and now i want you to tell me all about mr</s>  le bretonand the babydot you call her mr</s>  berkeley told meand yourselftoo for though ive never seen you before i feel of courselike an old friend of the family having known your husband so veryintimately</s> lady hilda designedly delivered all this long harangue straightoff without a break in her goahead breathless voluble fashionbecause she felt sure edie wouldnt feel perfectly at her ease atfirst and she wanted to give her time to recover from the firstfoolish awe of that meaningless prefix lady</s>  moreover lady hildain spite of her offhand manner was a good psychologist and a truewoman and she had concocted her little speech on the spur of themoment with some cleverness so as just to suit her instinctivereading of edies small personal peculiarities</s>  she saw in a momentthat that slight pale delicate girl was lost in london far fromher own home and surroundings and that the passing allusion totheir common devonshire origin would please and conciliate her asit always does with the clannish warmhearted simpleminded westcountry folk</s>  then again the deft hints as to their friendshipwith arthur berkeley as to ernests stay at dunbude and as toher own fear lest edie should be too learned for her all tendedto bring out whatever points of interest they had together whilethe casual touch about poor harrys reputation and the finalmention of little dot by name completed the conquest of ediessimple gentle little womans heart</s>  so this was the great ladyhilda tregellis she thought of whom she had heard so much andwhom she had dreaded so greatly as a grand rival</s>  why after allshe was exactly like any other devonshire girl in calcombe pomeroyexcept perhaps that she was easier to get on with and smiled agreat deal more pleasantly than ten out of a dozen</s> its very kind indeed of you to come edie answered smiling backas well as she was able the first moment that lady hilda allowedher a chance to edge in a word sideways</s>  ernest will be so veryvery sorry that hes missed you when he comes in</s>  hes spoken tome a great deal about you ever so many times</s> no has he really</s>  lady hilda asked quickly with unmistakableinterest and pleasure</s>  well now im so glad of that for to tellyou the truth mrs</s>  le breton though he was really always verykind to me and so patient with all my stupidity i more thanhalf fancied he didnt exactly like me</s>  in fact i was dreadfullyafraid he thought me a perfect nuisance</s>  im so sorry he isnt inbecause the truth is i came partly to see him as well as to seeyou and i should be awfully disappointed if i had to miss him</s> wheres he gone if i may ask</s>  perhaps i may be able to wait andsee him</s> oh hes only out walking somewhereursomewhere about hollowayedie answered half blushing at the nature of their neighbourhoodand glancing round the little room to see how it was likely tostrike so grand a person as lady hilda tregellis</s> hilda noticed the glance and made as if she did not notice it</s>  herheart had begun to warm at once to this poor pale eagerlookinglittle woman who had had the doubtful happiness of winning ernestle bretons love</s>  then i shall certainly wait and see him mrs</s>  lebreton</s>  she said cordially</s>  what a dear cosy little room youvegot here to be sure</s>  i do so love those nice bright littlecottage

i said should i write andask if i might stand as godmother and mr</s>  berkeley laughed atme and said what could i be dreaming of and did i think you weregoing to make your baby liable to fine and

darlingestlittle duck ever seen on earth since the beginning of all things</s> her various points of likeness to all her relations were dulydiscussed and hilda took particular pains to observe that shedidnt in the very faintest degree resemble that old horror ladyle breton</s>  then her whole past history was fully related she hadbeen fed on and what illnesses she had had and how many teethshe had got and all the other delightful nothings so perenniallyinteresting to the maternal heart</s>  hilda listened to the wholeaccount with unfeigned attention and begged leave to be allowedto dance dot in her own strong arms and tickled her fat cheek withher slender forefinger and laughed with genuine delight when thebaby smiled again at her and turned her face to be tickled a secondtime</s>  gradually hilda brought the conversation round to ernestsjournalistic experiences and at last she said very quietly imsorry to learn from mr</s>  berkeley dear that your husband doesntget quite as much work to do as he would like to have</s> edies tender eyes filled at once with swimming tears</s>  that oneword dear said so naturally and simply touched her heart atonce with its genuine half unspoken sympathy</s>  oh lady hildashe answered falteringly please dont make me talk about that</s> we are so very very very poor</s>  i cant bear to talk about it toyou</s>  please please dont make

edies wan hand tenderly in hers and leaning above herand stroking her hair softly with a sisters fondness the dooropened very quietly and arthur berkeley stood for a moment pausingin the passage and looking in without a word upon the unexpectedsight that greeted his wondering vision</s>  he had come to call uponernest about some possible opening for a new writer on a paper latelystarted and hearing the sound of sobs within had opened the doorquietly and tentatively</s>  he could hardly believe his own eyes whenhe actually saw lady hilda tregellis sitting there side by sidewith edie le

gazed silently with the awe of chivalrous respectupon the tearful beautiful picture</s>  then he shut the door againnoiselessly and unperceived and stole softly out into the streetto wait alone for
