wirewinter had begun and snow blew about the lonely telegraph shack wherejim dearham studied an old french romance</s>  he read rather by way ofmental discipline than for enjoyment and partly with the object ofkeeping himself awake</s>  life is primitive in the british columbian bushand jim sometimes felt he must fight against the insidious influence ofthe wilds</s>  although he had chosen the latter when the cities palledhe had studied at mcgill with a view of embarking on a professionalcareer</s>  want of money was the main obstacle but love of adventure hadcounted for much</s>  his adventures had been numerous since he left theuniversity and he now and then tried to remind himself that he wascivilized</s> outside the shack the stiff dark pines rolled back to the frozen northwhere a new city fed the mining camps</s>  jim had been up there and hadfound some gold besides a copper vein but when he got his patent forthe latter his funds ran out and he returned to the south and followeda number of occupations</s>  some were monotonous and some exciting</s>  nonepaid him well</s>  now his clothes were old and mended with patches cutfrom cotton flourbags his skin was browned by wind and frost</s>  he wasthin and muscular and his eyes had something of the inscrutable calmthat marks the indians but the old french romance and one or twoother books hinted at cultivated taste</s>  as a matter of fact jim wasafraid of getting like an indian</s>  life in the wilds was good but oneran some risks</s> the shack was built of logs notched where they crossed at the cornersand caulked with moss</s>  there was a stone chimney and a big wood firesnapped on the hearth</s>  jim sat close to the blaze in a deerhide chairwith his old skin coat hung over the back to keep off the stingingdraughts</s>  he could see the telegraph instrument</s>  his and hiscomrades duty was to watch it day and night because theirs was a badsection and accidents happened</s>  jake had gone hunting and since thegale outside was freshening jim wondered why he stopped so long</s> after a time jim put down his book and mused</s>  by comparison with theragged tents in which he had lived in the northern barrens the shackwas comfortable</s>  axes and tools for mending the line stood in acorner old clothes slickers and long boots that must be mendedoccupied another</s>  a good supply of provisions was stowed on someshelves a rifle and a shotgun hung on the wall</s>  he had all a manneeded in the woods and admitted that he was lucky to have so much butthe rudeness of his surroundings sometimes jarred</s>  this was strangebecause he had never known luxury</s>  he wondered whether he hadinherited his dislike for ugliness and the instincts of which he wasnow and then vaguely conscious</s>  it was possible for his father whodied when jim was young had come from the old country</s> then he dwelt with languid enjoyment upon something that happened whenhe was a waiter at a fashionable restaurant at montreal</s>  a party ofenglish tourists came in one day for lunch</s>  jim remembered the scenewell the spacious room with the sunshine on the pillars and thereflections on glass and silver the flies about the tables themonotonous throb of the electric fan and the strangers looking for aplace</s>  there were two men one older than the other and a girl</s>  jimhad often pictured her since and always with a curious satisfaction</s> it was not that she was beautiful although her face was finely moldedand her movements were graceful</s>  it was her delicate fastidiousnessand the hint one got of refinement and cultivation</s>  although shesmiled now and then jim remembered her calm and the tranquillity ofher voice</s>  he had not met a girl like that before but she went awaywith the others one of whom gave him a dollar and it was ridiculousto imagine he would see her again</s> this however was not important and he got up and went to thetelegraph instrument</s>  he called the next station and was satisfiedwhen he got an answer</s>  some government messages that must not bedelayed were to be sent north and the line was working well</s>  jim wentback to his chair and soon afterwards leaned forward listening</s>  heheard the wind in the pinetops and the thud of snow shaken from thetossing branches on the roof</s>  that was all but he had trained hissenses in the woods until they worked unconsciously</s>  somebody wascoming and he knew it was not jake</s> a minute or two afterwards he heard steps in the snow</s>  the steps wereheavy as if the men were tired</s>  somebody knocked and jim opened thedoor</s>  two men came in and throwing down their packs shook the snowfrom their ragged furs</s>  their boots were broken their leggins badlyworn and their faces were pinched with cold</s> i dont suppose youll turn us out</s>  its what our packers call prettyfierce tonight one remarked</s> certainly not said jim</s>  come right up to the fire</s>  how did youmake the shack</s> the strangers advanced and jim hid his surprise although they were themen whose lunch he had served at the montreal restaurant</s>  he hadlearned in the wilds something of the indians reserve</s> we hit the wire at dusk one replied</s>  we had been climbing with aparty of the canadian alpine club and stopped among the high rangeslonger than we meant</s>  in fact the snow rather surprised us</s>  theothers had gone before we started and we had a rough time coming south</s> you didnt make it without packers said jim who knew they wereenglish</s> we left the boys some distance back</s>  there was not much shelter atthe camp and although they were satisfied we resolved to follow theline and try to find a shack</s>  the boys will no doubt arrive in themorning</s> jim nodded because a line was cut through the forest for the telegraphwires</s> you ran some risk</s>  if you camped at sundown its a while since youhad supper</s>  i can give you coffee and a hot bannock</s> he put the kettle on the fire and when the meal was over studied hisguests as they lighted their pipes</s>  one was about thirty years oldand in spite of his ragged clothes jim thought him a man withcultivated tastes and wide experience</s>  the other was young and lookedfrank</s>  he had a refined intelligent face and was like the girl whomjim had seen at the restaurant she was perhaps a relation</s>  for atime the strangers talked about their journey and then one looked atjim rather hard</s> havent i seen you before</s> jim smiled</s>  at cibbleys as you go to the new postoffice atmontreal</s> oh yes</s>  it was a very wellserved lunch said the other and pickedup the french romance</s>  a curious book but rather fine in parts</s>  doyou understand the fellow</s> on the whole</s>  i like him you feel he has a grip</s>  still hespuzzling now and then</s> these french writers are puzzling always trying to work off anepigram the younger man remarked</s>  however i suppose theres asmuch french as english spoken at montreal and quebec</s> not french like this the other said with a smile</s>  i doubt if anuptodate boulevardier would own it for his mothers tongue</s>  youwould be surprised if you heard our cumberland farmers use chaucersenglish</s> i dont know they go back beyond him now and then</s>  when they counttheir sheep i imagine they talk like alfred or canute</s>  but suppose yougive us an example of ancient french</s> the older man opened the book and after turning a number of pages reada passage with taste and feeling</s>  then he looked at jim</s> hes primitive our thoughts run in another groove</s>  but i daresaytheres something archaic about quebec french and you perhaps know thelatter</s>  have i struck the right note</s> hit it first time</s>  anyhow youve got my notion of what he meantjim replied</s>  then he paused and added thoughtfully but i dont knowif were as different as you think</s>  in the north men get back toprimitive things</s> the other nodded</s>  its possible</s>  one certainly gets a primitivehunger and learns something about bodily needs</s> jim lighted his pipe and mused</s>  he had not talked to cultivated peoplesince he left mcgill</s>  he felt rather moved and quietly excited thestrange thing was their english voices and manner were not new</s>  in away it was ridiculous but he felt as if he had known them or othersof their kind before</s> you are from the old country and your friend seems to knowcumberland he said</s>  do you know langrigg hall</s> he thought the older man gave him a keen glance but next moment hisface was inscrutable and with a little gesture of satisfaction hestretched his legs to the fire</s>  his companion however lookedinterested</s> why yes said the latter</s>  but there are a number of langriggs inthe north of england</s> at the place i mean there is a marsh</s> then i do know the hall</s>  it stands upon a low ridgewhat we call aknowewith the big fells behind and the sands in front</s>  at lowwatera river winds about the flats</s>  its a fine old house although itssmall</s> isnt there a square tower with a battlement</s>  the roof beams in theolder part are bent not straight</s> the other looked surprised</s>  have you been there</s> no said jim thoughtfully</s>  ive never left canada but a man iknew used to talk about langrigg</s>  i expect he told me about thesethings he is dead now</s> he glanced at the older man</s>  the latters eyes were halfclosed andhis pose was slack as if he were languidly enjoying the warmth butjim thought he had been listening</s>  then he wondered why the othersshort description had given him so distinct a picture he could see therugged blue hills in the background and the river winding among thesands</s>  after all his father had not talked about langrigg often infact only once or twice when he was ill</s>  moreover jim reflectedthat he himself had used no western colloquialisms he had talked tothe strangers like an englishman</s> then your friend must have been at langrigg</s>  it looks as if he knewthe hall well remarked the younger man</s> his companion roused himself with a jerk</s>  i was nearly asleep</s>  giveme your pouch my tobaccos out</s> he filled his pipe and turned to jim</s>  hope i didnt interrupt</s>  iforget what we were talking about</s>  it looks as if you didnt like awaiters job</s> jim laughed and went to the telegraph which began to click</s>  he readthe message and calling the next station waited for a time and thenturned to his guests</s> lines broken and ive got to leave you</s>  you can use the bunks mypartner must sit up and watch the instrument when he comes back</s>  youcan tell him ive gone to look for the break</s> do you know where the break is</s>  the younger man asked</s> i dont know said jim putting on his fur cap and old skin coat</s> it maynt be far off and it may be some distance</s>  all i know is itsbetween here and the next shack</s> we found it hard to face the wind and theres more now</s> jim smiled</s>  one gets used to storms up here and the line must bemended</s>  some important messages from ottawa are coming along</s> he picked up some tools and when he opened the door the others heardthe scream of the gale</s>  the flames blew out from the snapping logs andan icy draught swept the room and roared in the chimney</s>  then the doorshut the fire burned steadily and all was quiet in the shack</s> our host excites ones curiosity said the younger man</s> you mean he excited yours</s>  youre an imaginative fellow dick</s> richard halliday had remarked that since they reached the shackmordaunt had not called him dick and vaguely wondered why</s>  lancemordaunt generally had an object</s>  dick doubted if he had been assleepy as he pretended when he asked for his tobacco pouch</s> oh well he said if we were in england you wouldnt expect tofind a fellow like this using his leisure to study oldfashionedfrench</s> we are not in england mordaunt rejoined</s>  when you judge canadiansby english standards youre likely to get misled</s>  the countrys so tospeak in a transition stage they havent developed schools ofspecialists yet and an intelligent man can often make good at anunaccustomed job</s>  this fellow for example was a waiter</s> he picked up the romance and put it on a shelf</s>  mordaunt was generallyneat and dick noted that he replaced the book in the spot from which ithad been taken and put the rest against it</s> anyhow its curious he knew about langrigg dick insisted</s> i dont think so said mordaunt carelessly</s>  a number of ourfarmers sons have emigrated</s>  he stated he had not left canada and theman who told him about langrigg was dead</s> the man who ought to own langrigg vanished in canada</s> on the whole i imagine thats lucky</s>  the trustees spent a large sumin trying to find him and were satisfied he was dead</s>  his age madethis probable</s> but he might have had a son</s> of course mordaunt agreed</s>  suppose he had a son</s>  the fellowobviously knows nothing about his inheritance and for that matterlangrigg is not worth much</s>  i expect hes engaged in some usefuloccupation chopping trees or keeping store for example and is nodoubt satisfied with his lot</s>  i dont suppose he is the kind of manyou would like to see at langrigg</s>  besides if he turned up a numberof people would suffer</s> that is so dick said thoughtfully</s>  after all however if franklindearham had a son he ought to be at langrigg</s>  joseph left the hall tofranklin and his heirs</s> mordaunt smiled</s>  it was as illogical as other things joseph did</s>  hewas not a good business man and spent the most part of his money afterhe quarreled with franklin and turned him out</s>  then shortly before hedied when franklin had vanished and the estate would hardly pay itsdebts he left him langrigg</s>  however the things done with and if ifound franklins heir i doubt if id feel justified in meddling</s> matters like this are better left alone</s>  he got up and stretchedhimself</s>  now im going to bed</s> he got into the nearest bunk which was filled with sprucetwigs andwild hay and soon went to sleep but for a time dick sat by the fire</s> the linesman had excited his curiosity it was strange the fellow knewabout langrigg</s>  then he was obviously a man with rather unusualqualities and character his books indicated this</s>  dick resolved tofind out something about him when he returned</s> by and by the other linesman came in with a muletail buck and whendick gave him jims message sat down by the telegraph</s>  dick went tobed and did not wake until his packers arrived at daybreak</s>  thelinesman was watching the telegraph but the finger had not moved andhe owned that he was getting anxious about his comrade</s> dick suggested that they should look for him but on the whole thelinesman hardly thought this necessary</s>  he said the man from the nextpost would have started to meet jim</s>  then mordaunt wanted to get off</s>
the snow had stopped the wind had fallen and if they missed thisopportunity they might be held up by another storm while their foodwas getting short</s>  dick hesitated but mordaunt generally led himwhere he would and after some argument he agreed to start</s>  half anhour later they left the shack and pushed on down the line</s> chapter iiin the snowwhen jim left the shack the cold pierced his furs like a knife</s>  for afew moments he heard nothing but the roar of the gale and could hardlyget his breath</s>  his eyes ran water and the snow beat his smartingface</s>  then he braced himself for he had gone out to mend the line onother bitter nights and could not lose his way</s>  where the telegraphruns through the forests of the north a narrow track is cut forpackhorse transport to the linesmens posts and one could not pushbetween the trunks that lined the gap without finding thickets andtangles of fallen logs</s>  the track however was not graded like aroad</s>  outcropping rocks broke its surface short brush had grown upand although the snow had covered some of the obstacles its top wassoft</s> for a time the trees broke the wind and jim pushed on hoping that hemight soon find a trailing wire but the posts loomed up undamagedout of the tossing haze</s>  luck was obviously against him and he mightbe forced to walk halfway to the next shack from which the otherlinesman would start</s>  the snow was loose and blew about in a kind offrozen dust that was intolerably painful to his smarting skin</s> although his cap had earflaps he could not cover his mouth and noseand the fine powder dried by the cold clogged his eyelashes andfilled his nostrils</s>  his old coat did not keep out the wind andalthough he was in partial shelter he was now and then compelled tostop for breath</s>  the gale was getting worse and as sometimes happenswhen a blizzard rages the temperature was falling</s> jims flesh shrank from the arctic blast but he knew that in the northbodily weakness must be conquered</s>  in the stern battle with savagenature prudence is a handicap one must risk all and do what oneundertakes since there is no place in the wilderness for the man whocounts the cost</s>  moreover jim had fought harder fights when hisstrength was lowered by want of food and he went forward conscious ofone thing the line was broken and must be mended</s>  there was no otherway</s>  he must give up his post if he could not make good</s> in the meantime his physical senses developed in the wilds workedwith mechanical regularity and guarded him</s>  he could not hear muchthrough his fur cap and often for some moments could not see but hestopped when a tossing branch broke off and struck the snow in frontand sprang forward when a fir plunged down a few yards behind</s>  hecould not have stated that he knew the danger but he avoided it wherea stranger to the woods would have been crushed</s> perhaps the going was the worst</s>  plowing through the loose snow hestruck his feet against outcropping rocks and sometimes stubbed themhard on a fallen log</s>  in places he sank deep the labor was heavy andwind and cold made it awkward to breathe</s>  his lungs seemed crampedthe blood could not properly reach his hands and feet</s>  it was acomfort that they hurt because when he no longer felt the painfultingling the real trouble would begin</s>  one cannot feel when onesflesh is frozen</s>  he could not have seen his watch had he taken it outand doubted if there was warmth enough in his body to keep it goingbecause watches and gunlocks often freeze in the north</s>  for all thathe knew how long he had left the shack and how much ground he hadcovered</s> men like dearham learn such things and by the halfinstinctivefaculties they develop canadian traffic is carried on in winter storms</s> telegraph linesmen in the bush and railroad hands on mountain sectionsuse powers beyond the imagining of sheltered city men</s>  they make goodgiving all that can be demanded of flesh and blood the wires work andmontrealvancouver expresses keep time in the snow</s> one thing made jims task a little easier</s>  the wire was overhead andwhen he reached the break he would see the trailing end</s>  the trees hadbeen chopped back there was nothing to help the currents leap toearth and he would not be forced to cut and call up the next shackwith his battery</s>  he wanted to find a fallen post but as he struggledforward the halfseen poles came back out of the icy mist in anunending row</s>  he had been out two hours and had not reached the worstspot</s>  the line had no doubt broken at silvers gulch</s> some time afterwards he stopped and leaned against a post</s>  the woodsbroke off behind him and in front a gap filled with waves of snowopened up</s>  he could not see across indeed for a few moments hecould hardly see at all but the turmoil that came out of the darkhollow hinted at its depth</s>  he heard the roar of tossing trees farbelow and his brain reproduced an accurate picture of the gulch thatpierced the high tableland</s>  it was wide just there but narrowedfarther on and a river fed by a glacier flowed through the defile</s> the river was probably frozen although it ran fast</s>  the wires wentdown obliquely and in one place there was a straight fall of a hundredfeet</s>  the rest of the rugged slope was very steep and one needed somenerve to follow the row of posts when the light was good</s> jim did not hesitate when he had got his breath</s>  with a blizzardraging his job would not bear thinking about</s>  he let go the post andslipped down some distance</s>  when he stopped he got up badly shaken andcrawled down cautiously trying to keep the line in sight but it wasnot a logical sense of duty that urged him on he only knew he must notbe beaten</s>  he fought instinctively because this was a region where togive ground in the battle generally means to die</s> he reached a bend of the line where a post stood on a broken pitch thatwas almost a precipice</s>  twenty or thirty yards below it became aprecipice and jim met the full force of the wind as he crept round thecorner</s>  then he saw a trailing wire and a little farther on abroken post that had slipped down some distance</s>  crouching in the snowbehind a rock for a few minutes he thought hard</s>  although the postwas short and not very heavy he could not drag it back while the wirewas attached</s>  the latter must be loosed and fixed again when the postwas in its place but it would be enough if the line was lifted a footor two from the ground</s>  proper repairs could be made afterwards theimportant thing was the government messages should not be held up</s>  forall that it would be hard to reach the spot</s> he crawled down and stopped beside the post</s>  the snow was blindingthe wind buffeted him savagely and since he was near the top of theprecipice it was risky to stand up</s>  his fur mittens embarrassed himbut he could not take them off because when the thermometer fallsbelow zero one cannot touch steel tools with unprotected hands</s>  aftersome trouble jim loosed the wire and then saw the broken ends wouldnot meet</s>  however since the line curved a post could be cut in orderto shorten the distance and he crawled back to the spot where he hadleft his ax</s>  had he not been used to the snowy wilds he could nothave found the tool</s> he cut the post and with numbed and clumsy hands joined the wire butit must now be raised from the ground</s>  it was impossible to get thefallen post on end and had he been able to do so powder would have beenneeded to make a hole</s>  he could however support the post on a rockand he floundered up and down in the snow looking for a suitable spot</s> when he found a place it was some way from the post which was tooheavy to move and he went cautiously down hill for the other</s> although this was lighter he did not see how he could drag it back tothe level he had left and he sat down behind a rock and thought</s> his coat and cap were heavy with frozen snow that the wind had driveninto the fur in spite of his efforts he was numbed and the galeraged furiously</s>  the snow blew past the rock in clouds that lookedlike waves of fog he had been exposed to the icy blast for three orfour hours and could not keep up the struggle long</s>  the warmth wasleaving his body fast</s>  yet he did not think much about the risk</s>  hisbusiness was to mend the line and his acquiescence was to some extentmechanical</s>  to begin with he must get the post up the hill and hebraced himself for the effort</s> he could just lift the butt and getting it on his shoulder faced theclimb staggering forward a few steps while the thin end of the postdragged in the snow and then stopping</s>  it was tremendous labor andhe knew he would need all the strength he had left to reach the shackbut in the meantime this did not count</s>  getting home was a problemthat must be solved after the line was mended</s> at length he reached the spot he had fixed upon fastened the wire tothe insulator and lifted the top of the post a few feet</s>  the job wasdone but his body was exhausted and his brain was dull</s>  he had madegood and was conscious of a vague satisfaction</s>  he could not howeverindulge feelings like this he must now nerve himself for the effort toget home</s> he went down hill a little in order to shorten the curve and it wasthen when he had conquered his luck failed</s>  his foot slipped andwhen he fell he started a small snowslide that carried him down</s>  hecould not stop the dry snow flowed about him like a river and he knewthere was a precipice not far below</s>  the snow carried him over aledge he plunged down a few yards and brought up against a projectingrock</s>  the blow shook him he felt something snap and for a minute ortwo nearly lost consciousness</s>  then he was roused by a sharp prick anda feeling that something grated in his side</s>  he knew what hadhappened one or perhaps two of his ribs had broken and an incautiousmovement had driven the broken end into the flesh</s> the mechanical injury however was the worst since jim was too hardto collapse from shock and he lay quiet trying to think</s>  one couldwalk in spite of a broken rib jim had known badly injured men walk twoor three hundred miles to reach a doctor but the blizzard would tryhis strength</s>  it was a long way to the shack and farther to the nextpost but on the whole he thought it prudent to make for the latter</s> the linesman finding the line broken would set out to look for thebreak and when jim met him his help would be useful</s>  in fact itmight be necessary</s> he felt a sharper prick as he got up but he followed the posts downthe gulch and toiled up the other side</s>  his breathing was labored andpainful as he climbed the rugged slope</s>  at the top the ground wasroughly level and the tossing pines gave some shelter from the wind</s> jim coughed now and then and thought there was a salt taste in hismouth</s>  this looked ominous and the stabs caused by his joltingmovements hurt but he would not think about it</s>  it was pain notblood that gave him the salt taste</s>  he had done his job and begun aharder fight</s>  the claim of duty had been met and now he was fightingfor his life</s> the pines roared as he struggled on and at times a blinding haze ofsnow filled the gap</s>  he had thrown away his tools but his coat wasgetting heavy</s>  now and then he tried to brush off the snow and wipedhis lips</s>  the salt taste was plainer but he was not going to admit heknew what it meant and was glad he could not see his mittens when hetook them from his mouth</s>  speed was important and he labored on</s>  hecould not remember afterwards how long he stumbled forward but atlength he stopped and stood swaying dizzily when an indistinct objectloomed through the snow</s>  it was like a man and came towards him</s> hallo</s>  why pete he gasped and with an effort reached and leanedagainst a pine</s> the other stopped</s>  its pete all right but what dyou allow youredoing on my piece of the section</s> reckoned i might meet you coming along jim replied leaning hardagainst the tree</s>  you can take the back trail</s>  the lines fixed</s> thats good</s>  but why are you heading this way</s>  i dont get you yet</s> i fell down the gulch</s>  some ribs broke</s> ah</s>  said pete</s>  which side</s> jim indicated the spot where he felt the stabs and pete went to hisother side</s> its a blamed long hike to my shack but youve got to make it</s>  if westop here we freeze</s>  put your arm on my shoulder</s> they set off and jim was glad to use such help as the other couldgive</s>  he was getting dull and began to doubt if he could reach theshack but although both would freeze if they stopped pete would notleave him</s>  it was not a thing to argue about</s>  pete was a white manand in the north the white mans code is stern</s>  one here and theremight have a yellow streak but as a rule such a man soon left thewilds</s>  anyhow pete was going to see him through</s>  both would make theshack or both would be buried in the snow</s>  it was not a matter ofgenerous sentiment one did things like that</s> they made it somehow at a cost neither afterwards talked about for atlength a pale glimmer pierced the blowing snow</s>  then the dark bulk ofa building loomed up ahead and pete pushed open a door</s>  he was forcedto use both hands to shut the door and jim left without supportstaggered into the room</s>  his head swam his eyes were dim and hischin was red</s>  there was a chair if he could reach it but it seemedto be rocking about and when he stretched out his hand it had gone</s> next moment he fell with a heavy thud</s>  he felt a horrible stab a fitof coughing shook him and he knew nothing more</s> chapter iiithe third partnersome weeks after he mended the line jim sat by a window in a smallframe house at vancouver city</s>  he had been very ill and knew littleabout his journey on a handsledge from the telegraph shack to

twicejake thought his comrade would succumb but they reached the railroadand he put jim on the cars</s> now jim was getting better and had left his bed for a rockingchair</s> the house stood on the

smiledand he resumed perhaps the strangest thing was they knew a place inthe old country my father sometimes talked about</s> did you tell them your father knew the place</s>  carrie asked for theclue

 transport comes high</s> when you leave the railroad everything comes high as youre going tofind out</s>
 guess your trouble is you havent enough capital</s> the troubles pretty common jake rejoined</s>  you dont find rich menhitting the trail to the woods</s> a sure thing said the other</s>  well youre not going to get richcutting the new telegraph line</s>  your outfits not strong enough youhavent stores and tools</s>  tell you what ill do ill give you sevenhundred and fifty dollars to let up</s> i dont know if youre generous or if youre rash jake remarked witha twinkle</s>  the truck were hauling in cost us more than that</s> ill take it at a valuation and you can find the men to fix the price</s> jake looked at jim who pondered and hesitated</s>  he was dispirited andtired and felt that the chance of their carrying out the contract wasnot good</s>  it would be something of a relief to get their money back</s> i dont know who you are and why you want to buy us off he said</s> then ill put you wise</s>  im probyn cartner and dawsons man</s>  theywanted the new branchline job and

bad jake remarked</s>  if theres much of it i dontsee why cartner and dawson want the contract</s> for one thing they reckon its theirs</s>  then they have money enoughto get to work properly</s>  you have taken up too big a job and nowsyour chance to quit</s>  if youre prudent you wont let it go</s> jim pondered for he thought he had got a hint</s>  cartner and dawsonwere contractors and with one or two more did much of the public work</s> in fact it was said that the few large firms pooled the best jobs andcombined to keep off outsiders</s>  jim had been somewhat surprised whenjake secured the contract and imagined this was because it was notlarge enough for the others to bother about</s>  the branch line was short</s> oh well he said as carelessly as he could weve got to try to putit over</s>  seven hundred and fifty dollars wouldnt pay us for the timeweve spent</s> probyn leaned forward</s>  you want to call me up</s>  well ill stand fora thousand dollars but thats my best</s> jake looked at jim and both hesitated</s>  a thousand dollars was a usefulsum and in a way they would get it for nothing</s>  cartner and dawsonwould pay but if the offer were refused their opposition must bereckoned on</s>  it was obvious that they did not mean to allow poachingon the preserves they claimed</s>  then jim thought about carrie and felthalf ashamed of his caution</s>  she was a partner and although she didnot know the difficulties she would not hesitate</s>  he did not know ifhe was weak or not but he did not want her to think he had no pluck</s> while he mused carrie came in looking pale and tired but she stoppedand gave probyn a direct glance</s> who is this</s>  she asked</s> he comes from cartner and dawson the big contractors and wants tobuy us off jake replied</s>  he offers a thousand dollars if well getout</s> ah</s>  exclaimed carrie</s>  what did you say</s> we havent said much</s>  we were thinking about it when you came in</s> carries eyes sparkled and her tired look vanished</s>  it wont standfor thinking about</s>  tell him you undertook the job and are going tomake good</s> jake shrugged humorously and turned to jim</s>  well i guess we neededbracing</s>  what do you say partner</s> well hold on</s> probyn frowned</s>  is the dame a member of the firm</s> she is jake said smiling</s>  in fact when were up against itshes the boss

broke</s> its possible said carrie</s>  all the same we mean to hold it down</s> probyn shrugged</s>  then i quit</s>  if you can put the job over youreluckier than i think</s> he went off and carrie sat down</s>  looks as if i came along when i wasneeded</s>  the fellow talked in hints</s>  what did he mean</s> its pretty obvious jake replied</s>  his employers dont like ourbutting in</s>  since they cant buy us theyll try to freeze us out</s> then i reckon we must fight</s> jake looked thoughtful</s>  theyre strong antagonists but ive a notiontheres somebody on our side</s>  in fact i was puzzled when we got thecontract</s>  its not often a job of this kind goes past the others butthe department may be using us to see if its possible to shake thecombine</s>  he paused and laughed as he resumed anyhow we have madethe plunge and if were not going under have got to go ahead</s> jim agreed and for a time they talked about something else but nextmorning jake got a jar when he went to load the packhorses and foundtwo of his helpers gone</s> they pulled out at sunup one of the rest explained</s>  a strangercame along looking for choppers offered fifty cents more than youpromised and steve and pete went off with him</s> hell probably shake them in a week jake replied</s>  still fiftycents a days some inducement and all of you can chop</s> the packer laughed</s>  thats a sure thing</s>  we reckoned we were fixedwell and had better stop with a boss we knew</s>  besides now weve adame for commissary the hash is pretty good</s> jake went back to the hotel disturbed about probyn but satisfied withhis men</s>  the two who had gone were strangers but two of the rest hadbeen with him in the north and the others had worked upon the telegraphline</s>  one could trust them</s>  for all that he was quiet when they setoff on the muddy trail that plunged into the bush</s>  a cold wind blewthe rain in their faces the horses stumbled in the holes and the wetmen grumbled as they plodded through the mud</s>  they knew the wildernessand felt themselves a small company for the work they must do</s> moreover jake imagined they might have to meet the antagonism of richand unscrupulous rivals</s> you dont say much he remarked to jim</s> one doesnt say much the morning one pulls out to start a big job</s> anyhow ill own its not my habit</s>  for one thing i know what wereup against jim replied</s>  then he saw jakes twinkle and smiled</s>  mynotion is you have been quieter than me</s> oh well said jake youre not always very bright but this tripsa picnic after some weve made</s>  if we go broke we can come downagain the last time we took the north trail we had to make good orfreeze</s> you hadnt your sister with you then</s> thats so jake agreed</s>  i reckon it makes some difference</s>  perhapsyou had better go ahead and talk to her</s>  carries rather fed up butshe maynt be as frank to you</s> jim urged the packhorse he was leading and came up with carrie whowas a short distance in front</s>  he wondered what he had better talkabout but found it easier to amuse her than he had thought</s>  carriedid not look tired now she had a touch of color and her eyes werebright</s>  she laughed at his remarks although he admitted that hishumor was clumsy and did not seem to mind when the horse splashed herwith mud</s>  carrie had pluck but he imagined her cheerfulness wasforced</s>  by and by a knot on the packrope slipped and some tools andcooking pans fell with a clash</s>  when jim began to pick them up carriestopped a yard or two in front</s> you neednt hurry ill go on she said</s>  its cleaner away from thehorses and one can look for the dry spots</s> jim gave her a quick glance</s>  although she smiled her voice had a noteof strain</s>  it had not been easy for her to pretend and he had forcedher to the effort</s> im sometimes dull but i mean well he said apologetically</s> of course you meant well</s>  jake sent you didnt he</s>  he knowssomething about my moods</s> jim colored and seeing his embarrassment she laughed</s> you dont deserve that i get mad now and then</s>  the things my faultany way</s>  i started well but hadnt grit enough to keep it up</s> however hadnt you better pick those pans out of the mud</s> jim replaced the articles and when he had refastened the load waitedfor jake</s> it looks as if carrie had turned you down the latter remarked</s> im not surprised jim rejoined</s>  ive been talking like a drummerwhen she wanted to be alone</s> oh well said jake you havent a very light touch but i expectshe saw your intention was good</s> she did not she saw you had sent me</s>  your sister is cleverer thanyou think</s> jake grinned and pulled his horse round a hole</s>  theyre all clevererthan we think</s>  sometimes its an advantage and sometimes a drawback</s> anyhow i guess i wont meddle again</s>  carrie will make good if weleave her alonehe turned for the horse behind them pushed forward and bit the animalhe led</s> watch out</s>  he shouted</s>  drive your beast on</s> jim did so and then stopped a few yards off while the animals plungedround each other and a man behind ran up</s>  jake sticking to thebridle was dragged about his horses load struck against a tree and aflourbag burst</s>  while he tried to stop the white stream running fromthe hole the other horse seized his arm and shook him savagely</s>  itsdriver joined in the struggle with a thick branch and the men andanimals floundered about the trail while the flour ran into the mud</s> let up with the club</s>  jake shouted</s>  the dried apples have gone now</s> you have hit the bag</s> hold your beast then gasped the other</s>  this troubles not goingto stop until mine gets in front</s> jake with an effort pulled the kicking animal between two trees andthere was quietness when the other passed</s>  it looked round for amoment and then plodded forward steadily while the desiccated applesran down on the trail</s> now well stop and fix those bags jake remarked</s>  why in thunderdid you let the brute go bill</s> he was mushing along good and quiet and i wanted to light my pipe</s> reckon he forgot he wasnt in his place</s> then they heard a laugh and saw carrie close by</s>  jake was covered withmud and flour and his hat which had been trampled on hung over hishot face</s> you look the worse for wear she said</s> i guess i feel like that jake replied indicating his torn overalls</s> putting some of the damage right will be a job for you but my hatspast your help</s>  you wouldnt think it cost three dollars not longsince</s> but what was the kicking and biting about</s> you heard the explanation</s>  bills cayuse forgot he wasnt in hisproper place</s>  when he remembered he tried to get there</s> i dont understand yet</s> a packhorse knows his place in the row</s>  hes a creature of habit andhates to see another animal where he ought to be but bill was late inloading up and we didnt stop for him</s>
 now you have got the thing</s> carrie laughed and jim noted there was no reserve in her amusement</s> her moodiness had vanished</s> its ridiculous but you must indulge him another time she said</s> food is dear</s> they went on with lighter hearts</s>  the struggle and carries laugh hadbraced them and by and by bright sunbeams touched the trunks besidethe narrow trail</s> chapter vcarries weak momentthe rain had stopped and big drops fell from the dark firs about thecamp</s>  daylight was going all was very quiet but for the distant soundof falling water and the smoke of the sulky fire went straight up</s> white chips and empty provision cans lay beside the freshlychoppedlogs</s>  jake had left camp after supper the men had gone to fish andcarrie had taken off her wet boots and sat by the fire trying to dryher clothes</s>  for the last three or four days the party had traveledacross very rugged country and had now reached the spot where the newline would branch off</s> carrie was cold and depressed</s>  one of the men who joined probyn wascook and although she had undertaken his duties cheerfully she foundthem harder than she thought</s>  then when they pitched camp the wood themen brought was wet the fire would not burn well and the extra goodsupper she had meant to cook was spoiled</s>  this was the climax of anumber of small troubles and hardships and carries patience had givenway</s>  by and by jim came out of the gloom and stopped by the fire</s> crying carrie</s>  why is that</s> carrie who had not heard his steps started and tried to hide her feetbehind her draggled skirt</s> i wasnt she said rather sharply</s>  anyhow if i was you oughtntto have noticed</s> perhaps not</s>  jake told me not long since my touch wasnt light</s>  butwhat has gone wrong</s> its all gone wrong she answered drearily</s>  i oughtnt to havecome</s>  supper was the last thingthe supper was quite good jim declared</s> quite good</s>  well i suppose thats all you can say for it honestly</s> if you liked it its curious you didnt eat very much</s>  then you seei can cook and i wanted to make a little feast to celebrate yourbeginning the job</s> nobody could cook at a fire like that</s>  besides folks are notfastidious in camp</s>  when youre chopping and cutting rock all day youcan eat whatever you get</s>
your touch is certainly not light id sooner you were fastidiouscarrie rejoined</s> looks as if id taken the wrong line jim said gently</s>  i hate tosee you disturbed</s> do you hate it very much</s> yes said jim</s>  thats why im awkward</s>
carrie gave him a quick glance and turned her head</s>  the firelighttouched his face and she noted his grave sympathy</s> oh</s>  she said im a silly little fool</s>  i would comealthough iknew you didnt want me</s> i thought you would find things hard jim replied with someembarrassment</s> i do find them hard thats the trouble because theyre really nothard</s>  the faults mine i havent enough grit</s> you are full of grit jim declared</s>  ive known men knocked out byan easier journey</s> youre trying to be nice and i dont like that</s>  i didnt want you tocome just now but since you have come sit down and smoke</s>  i meant tobe a partner and help you both along</s> but you have helpedcarrie looked up quickly</s>  oh you are dull</s>  you dont see i want toconfess</s>  its sometimes a comfort to make yourself look as mean aspossible</s>  afterwards you begin to imagine youre perhaps not quite sobad</s> i dont know if its worth while to bother about such things jimremarked</s> you dont bother</s>  when youre on the trail youre occupied about thehorses and how far you can go</s>  nothing else matters and jake ofcourse never bothers at all</s>  he grins</s>  but i insisted on coming andwhen the man at the hotel wanted to buy you off i made you refuse</s>  youknow i did</s>  you were hesitating</s> on the whole im glad you were firm</s> it was easy to be firm at the hotel but i ought to have kept it up</s> i was vain and sure of myself when id come up in a wagon over agraded road</s> the road was pretty bad said jim</s> anyhow it was a road and i sat in a wagon carrie rejoined</s>  whenthe road stopped and we hit the real wild country i got frightenedlike a child</s>  what use is there in starting out if you cant go on</s> you have gone on</s>  i dont think many girls from the cities would haveborne the journey with an outfit like ours</s>  but i dont quite get yourobject for leaving home</s> ah said carrie you have done what you wanted although it wasperhaps hard</s>  you have tasted adventure seen the wild north andfound gold</s>  you havent known monotony done dreary things that neverchange and tried to make fifty cents go as far as a dollar</s>  if youhad talents you could use them but it wasnt like that with me</s>  idont know if i have talent but i felt i could do something betterthan bake biscuit and sell cheap groceries</s>  i longed to do somethingdifferent to go out and take my chances and see if i couldnt make mymark</s>  then i wanted money for mothers sake</s>  so i came but as soonas i got wet and tired i was afraid</s> jim pondered</s>  carrie had pluck it meant much that she had owned herfears</s>  she meant to conquer them and he imagined she looked to him forhelp</s>  his business was to give her back her confidence but this couldnot be done by awkward flattery</s>  in the meantime he looked about</s> the fire had sunk the moon was rising and through a gap between thetrunks one could see a dark gulf out of which thin mist rolled</s>  thevapor streamed across long rows of ragged pines that ran up among therocks until they melted in the gloom</s>  in the distance a glimmeringline of snow cut against the sky</s>  the landscape had grandeur but notbeauty</s>  it was stern and forbidding</s> i think we are all afraid now and then he said</s>  i never hit thenorth trail without shrinking</s>  perhaps its instinct or somethinglike that</s>  in the cities man lives in comfort by using machines buthes up against nature all the time in the wilds</s>  she must be foughtand beaten and he must leave behind the weapons he knows</s>  up north asmall accident or carelessness may cost you your life an ax forgottena bag of flour lost mean frostbite and hunger that may stop the march</s> you have got to be braced and watchful its a grim country and itkills off the slack</s>  but we are only on its edge and things aredifferent here</s>  if we are beaten we can fall back</s>  the trail to thecities is open</s> would you fall back</s>  carrie asked</s> not unless im forced jim answered with a laugh</s> nor will i said carrie</s>  ive been a fool tonight but if im upagainst silly old things like instincts im going to put them down</s> you will make good all right</s>  but what did your mother think when youresolved to come with us</s> carrie hesitated and then gave jim a level glance</s> you didnt see mother much</s>  she was busy shes always busy and youdont know her yet</s>  shes quiet you dont feel her using control butone does what she wants and i cant remember when that was wrong</s> well i suppose she felt on the surface i oughtnt to go</s>  it was theproper conventional view but when its needful mother can go deep</s>  ithink she was willing to give me a chance of finding out and tryingmy powers she knew i wouldnt be so restless afterwards if i washappier or not</s>  carrie paused and there was a touch of color in herface as she resumed besides she knew she could trust jake and ithink she trusts you</s> jim said nothing</s>  it looked as if the little faded woman who had beenoccupied about the store all day had qualities he had not imaginedalthough he now remembered he had sometimes got a hint of reservedforce</s>  all was quiet for a minute or two while he mused and then theyheard steps and jake came up</s> ive been prospecting up the line</s>  we have got our job he said</s> whats the trouble</s>  bush pretty thick</s> rocks</s>  theyre lying loose right up the slope and its going to costus high to roll them away</s>  then its possible another lot will comedown</s> jim frowned</s>  they had undertaken to clear a track of stated widthalong which packhorses could travel as well as fix the telegraphposts and a bank of big loose stones would be a troublesome obstacle</s> much depended on the steepness of the hillside and he had not yet seenthe ground</s> if we have to build up and underpin the line it will certainly costus something he said</s>  however well find that out as we go on</s> the main thing is to start</s> i allow thats so</s>  when you start you finish jake remarked</s>  stilldollars will count in this fight and we may go broke</s> its possible</s>  anyhow well hold on until we are broke</s> carrie laughed</s>  and thats all there is to it jim</s>  i like your wayof looking at things</s>  its simple and saves trouble</s> it puts it off jim rejoined dryly</s>  the trouble sometimes comes atthe end</s>  but its rather curious how often you can make good by justholding on</s> oh well</s>  said carrie</s>  i hear the boys coming</s>  go and see if theyhave caught some fish</s> jim went off and presently returned with a string of big gray trout</s> sitting down he began to sharpen his knife but carrie stopped him</s> leave them alone</s>  how many will the boys eat for breakfast</s> to some extent it depends on how many they get</s>  if theyre up totheir usual form i reckon theyll eat the lot</s>  but what has that todo with it</s>  ill fix the trout</s> no said carrie</s>  give me your knife</s> certainly not</s>  do you like dressing fish</s> i expect ill hate it but im going to try</s>  do you want me tostruggle with a small blunt knife</s> jim looked hard at her</s>  her mouth was firm and he knew what her touchof color meant</s> i undertook to help cook she resumed and smiled</s>  its curious howoften you can make good by just holding on</s>  now however you and jakecan go away</s> they went off but presently jim sat down and lighted his pipe</s> although he approved carries

keen and sometimes hereceived unconsciously impressions of minute noises</s>  although thestillness was only broken by the turmoil of the river far down in thevalley he imagined it was not for nothing

built had broken and the stones behind itwere plunging down</s> when he reached the line he struck his foot against a rock andstumbled</s>  the ground was rough the night was dark but it

louder</s>  he heardgreat blocks strike the ledges down the slope and smash trees brokeand branches crashed while behind the detached shocks there was asteady dull roar of small gravel grinding across the rocks and tearingup the brush</s>  the wall had obviously gone and its collapse had starteda slide that might not stop until all the stones above the line had rundown</s>  if so they might plane off a wide belt of hillside and carrythe soil and broken timber into the valley</s>  then jim would be forcedto dig out another line</s> he gasped as he labored on but the uproar had begun to die away

hill</s>  thewall had vanished with the line it was meant to protect</s>  now and thena big stone rolled by but jim did not think about the risk</s>  he musttry to find out if much of the surface was left and if there was rockbeneath</s> when he left the end of the line small stones slipped away from hisfeet and plunged down into the dark</s>  this was ominous since gravel isawkward stuff to work among when it does not lie at rest</s>  howeverwith plenty of stakes and some underpinning he might be able to buildup a new bank</s>  by and by his foot struck something sharp and he lookedup</s>  he had kicked the edge of a large ragged stone and anindistinct broken mass ran up the hill</s>  the blocks had obviously comedown from the bottom of the crags and since they had gone no fartherthe pitch was easy enough for them to lie</s>  this would enable him toclear a line across the mass and build a fresh bank</s> jim sat down and took out his pipe</s>  he had lost his labor and money hecould not spare but it was possible to run the line across thetreacherous belt although he was half afraid to count the cost</s>  whenhe struck a match jake came up and indistinct figures moved in thegloom

sunup wellhave a better notionoh yes said jim rather impatiently and added ive beenwondering why i wakened</s> i reckon thats plain enough</s>  the noise would have roused me threemiles off</s> it was

reflected much but perhaps its significant he and youagree</s> jim was silent for a minute or two and then asked did all the boyscome along</s> so far as i remember</s>  i didnt count</s> well said

again and did not go to sleep</s> chapter viia counciljim got up at daybreak and went to the spot where the landslide hadcarried away the line</s>  a hundred yards had gone and a great bank ofsoil and gravel ran down at an even slant to the river where thecurrent foamed about the rubbish that blocked its channel</s>  the slopewas dotted by broken trees and rocks and in one place farther up abelt of

provideagainst expensive accidents</s>  when he took the contract he had trustedmuch to luck and now his luck was bad</s> moreover the thing was puzzling and his curiosity was aroused</s>  heimagined he had made the line secure and had worked among treacherousgravel in shallow mines long enough to know something about the job</s> the wall had obviously broken and started the landslide when it

sooner we let up but somehow i cant see their findingit worth while to get after us</s> it is puzzling jake admitted i think well let it go</s>  if we haveany fresh bad luck our money will run out

raised hislimit a thousand dollars</s> shucks</s>  said jim</s>  does the fellow think well give him the mine</s> anyhow id sooner not sell to baumstein at all</s>  hes a crook and hasmade his pile by

shone like silver in themoonlight</s>  in places it was broken by shadows that seemed to trembleand melt</s>  jim knew he was getting sleepy and tried to rouse himself</s> it was something of an

do you mean the guy who came along with theindian packers</s> are you pretending you dont know the man</s> it doesnt matter anyhow the other rejoined</s>  im not going backto camp and theres something

gone a few yards he heard ashout and his antagonist looked round</s> stop right there</s>  said somebody and jim saw carrie standing abovethem on the wall</s>  she was in the moonlight and balanced a gun</s>  herface was white but resolute</s> put down your ax</s>  i mean to shoot</s>  she said</s> jim thought quickly</s>  the distance was short but he had not seencarrie use a gun</s>  she might miss and have some trouble to reload</s> besides he must save her the need for shooting and the othershesitation was his opportunity</s>  pulling himself together he leapedupon the fellow who stumbled

stumbled and jim with a tense effort liftedhim from the ground</s>  then gathering all his strength he tried tothrow him backwards but lost his balance and both plunged down theslope</s> the pitch was steep and they rolled for some distance until they strucka rocky ledge</s>  the chopper let go slipped across the ledge andvanished</s>  jim jarred by the shock lay still for some moments andwhen he

and wasbreathless</s>  her look was strained and her face white</s> are you hurt jim</s>  she asked</s> no not much anyhow</s>  go back to the track</s>  give me the gun</s> why do you want the

few yards above jim and jerked out the cartridges</s> stooping swiftly she picked them up and threw them among the trees</s> then she laughed a strained laugh and held out the gun</s> you may have it now she added</s>  you cant find the shells</s> then ill go without them jim rejoined and plunged down the hill</s> when he had gone a short distance he stopped</s>  his leg hurt and he hada dull recollection of a blow</s>  his leg was not cut perhaps thechopper had hit him with the flat of the ax or he had struck it on therock</s>  anyhow he was lame and could hardly keep his balance on

hadconcentrated on catching the fellow</s> something like that jim admitted</s>  i ought to have thought andafter a few minutes i did think</s> when you found you couldnt walk</s> well said jim

itdoesnt matter jim</s>  all thats important is i did come</s>  but you arelame and mustnt stand</s> i can stand as long as you can stand said jim who pulled off hisjacket and threw it on the ground</s>  youll find this softer than thestones</s>  he sat down opposite her and resumed now how did youhappen</s> i found some flour and pork had gone</s>  since one cant get foodbetween here and the settlement it looked as if somebody meant to pullout before we broke camp</s> jim nodded</s>  the fellow said hed made a cache</s>  youre very smart</s> but why didnt you tell jake</s> i suppose i ought to have told him carrie replied</s> he mused for a few moments and then broke out we have taken you forgranted</s>  when a thing needs doing you dont talk but get to work</s> perhaps this has drawbacks it doesnt always strike one how fine youreally are</s> carrie said nothing and he went on</s>  now i come to think of it ivebeen strangely dull</s>  you have cooked for us and cared for us

been very dull but so has jake jim declared</s>  i saw a neatpatch on his overalls and thought hed made a better job than hegenerally does when he starts sewing</s>  i imagine he doesnt know howthat

blanket</s>  youllfind a bed in the tent</s> i picked a spot to camp a piece back jim said rather awkwardly ashe got up</s> martin laughed</s>  since you reckoned cartner and i were on your trackyou

breakfast with martin and when he was going thelatter remarked i guess you understand you neednt bother about ourgetting after you</s>  go ahead and finish the job</s> thanks said jim smiling</s>  unless we go broke we mean to finish</s> very well said martin if you have to choose between quitting andselling your copper claim you had better let the telegraph contractgo</s>  he paused and gave jim a level glance</s>  looks like interestedadvice but i guess its sound</s> jim strapped on his pack and started down the valley</s>  he reached thetelegraph camp three or four days afterwards and

metired</s>  he beckoned the landlord</s>  get on a move i want a drink</s> he went into the hotel and when the door slammed jim was thoughtful</s> chapter xthe rapidin the morning jim started with three canoes and a few indians whom hehad engaged at the settlement because the siwash are clever river men</s> sometimes they tracked the canoes floundering along the rough bankwith a line round their shoulders sometimes they poled against therapid stream and now and then carried the craft and cargo across arocky portage</s>  the canoes were of the siwash type cut out of cedarlogs and burned smooth outside</s>  the high bow was rudely carved like abirds head the floor was long and flat</s>  they paddled well and astrong man could carry one upside down on his bent shoulders</s>  jimhad loaded them heavily and the tools and provisions had cost a largesum</s> his progress was slow and he was tired and disturbed when one eveninghe pitched camp after toiling across a long portage</s>  speed wasimportant and he had been longer than he thought while he did not knowif he could force his way up the dark gorge ahead</s>  besides an indianhad shown him the print of somebodys foot on a patch of wet soil</s> there was only one mark and in a sense this was ominous since itlooked as if the fellow had tried to keep upon the stones</s>  moreoverhe wore a heavy boot and jim could not see why a white man had enteredthe lonely gorge where there were no minerals or timber worthexploiting</s> after supper he got ready to start again at daybreak</s>  this was hisusual plan because ones brain is dull when one rises from a hardcold bed at dawn and in the wilds to leave tools or food behind hassometimes disastrous consequences</s>  he saw he had forgotten nothingand when dusk was falling rested for a time on the bank although hethought it prudent to sleep on board</s>  up stream the water threw backfaint reflections but its surface was dull and wrinkled where itnarrowed at the top of the rapid round which he had carried thecanoes</s>  then it plunged down into gloom that was deepened by a cloudof spray and its hoarse turmoil echoed among the hills</s>  a few charredrampikes rose behind the camp and jim sat beneath one with his backagainst a stone</s>  he had thrown off his jacket and his thin overallswere wet</s>  his back and arms ached and his feet were bruised</s> he pondered about the footstep</s>  the packhorse trail running north wasnot far off and while he slowly poled up stream the freighter couldhave reached the river in front of him</s>  when they talked at the hotelthe fellows manner was threatening but jim hardly thought he wouldmeddle</s>  his party was strong and if the other had meant to do himsome injury it was hardly probable he would have uttered his darkhints while the landlord was about</s>  after all the hints mightforecast the difficulty jim would have to engage transport anothertime</s>  still somebody had passed the spot not long since</s> the gloom deepened and although some light would linger in the sky allnight it was nearly dark at the bottom of the gorge</s>  the packers layabout the fire and by and by jim calling one of the siwash hauledthe first canoe to the bank</s>  when they got on board he let the craftswing out with the eddy and the row curving as the current changedrode behind a halfcovered rock a short distance from the stones</s> blurred rocks and trees loomed in the mist up stream below thefoaming rapid glimmered through the spray</s>  the river swollen bymelting snow and stained green by glacier clay was running fast</s> there was not much room in the canoe for bags of flour occupied thebottom and a grindstone and small forge were awkward things to stow</s> jim however found a spot where he could lie down and the indianhuddled in the stern</s>  he was a darkskinned man dressed like thewhite settlers except that he wore no boots</s>  as a rule he did nottalk much but by and by he put his hand in the water as if to measurethe speed of the current</s> contox hiyu chuck he said in chinook</s> jim imagined he meant the river was rising and did not know if this wasa drawback or not</s>  a flood might make poling harder but it wouldcover the rocks in the channel and probably leave an eddying slackalong the bank</s>  he agreed with the indian because the rock to whichthey had moored the canoe was getting smaller</s>  it made a kind ofbreakwater but it would be covered soon and the craft would feel theforce of the current</s>  still they ought to ride safely and an angrywash now beat against the bank of gravel where they had landed</s>  therewas no other landing for below the camp the river ran in white wavesbetween the rocks</s> although jim was tired he could not sleep</s>  for one thing he had losttime at the settlement and on the river jake was waiting for thetools and since wages were high delay was costly</s>  then the gorgeechoed with pulsating noise</s>  the roar of the rapid rose and fell heheard the wash of the eddy against the bank the sharp ripple where thecurrent split upon the rock and the rattle of gravel striking thestones</s>  the canoes rocked swung to and fro and brought up withsudden jerks</s>  he did not know if the indian slept but if he did anew note in the confused uproar would waken him</s> after a time the fellow moved and as his dark figure rose jim becamealert</s>  the indian was looking fixedly ahead but jim could see nothingin the gloom</s>  he noted mechanically that the rock had vanished itslocation was marked by a wedgeshaped streak of foam</s>  he signed to theindian who grunted but did not speak</s> then there was a crash as something struck the rock and a vague darkmass rebounded from and swung round the obstacle</s>  it rolled andhalfseen projections vanished and appeared again</s>  jim got on hisknees and seized a pole because he imagined a big log with brokenbranches was driving down on them</s>  a river canoe

it looked as if they would notswing far enough</s>  jim felt the veins on his forehead tighten and thepole bend as he strained with labored breath</s> the log came on its butt under water its ragged top riding high andswinging round</s>  there was a heavy shock the canoe lurched and abroken branch began to drag her down</s>  jim could not push off thegrinding mass and letting go the pole seized an ax</s>  he cut themooring line to ease the strain but when the rope parted and the logswung clear he was faced by another risk unless they could reach thegravel bank they would go down the rapid</s>  he could not find bottomnow and while he tried the log struck the next canoe</s>  his canoeswerved outshore the row was drifting fast and he shouted as he feltfor the ax</s> it was however obvious that the men in camp could not help much andhe nerved himself to make a hard choice</s>  if he held on all the canoeswould go down the rapid if he let two go one might be saved</s>  he cutthe line made fast astern the log and canoes vanished and he and theindian strained their muscles</s>  they had lost ground they could notrecover the gravel bank was sliding past and angry waves leaped aboutthe rocks below</s>  somehow they must make the bank before they werecarried down</s>  there was some water in the canoe jim heard it splashabout</s>  she was horribly heavy and his pole would not grip the bottom</s> when it slipped the current washed its end under the craft</s> he threw the pole on board and found a paddle</s>  the canoe rocked on awhite eddy but he got her head round and the revolution carried hertowards the shore</s>  they must drive her in before the backwash flungher off and for some moments he labored with weakening arms andheaving chest</s>  then a packer plunged in the bow struck ground andjim jumped over</s>  he was up to his waist in the white turmoil butanother packer seized the canoe and the indian thrust hard on hisbending pole</s>  the bow went farther into the gravel and with a savageeffort they ran her out</s>  jim leaned against a rock trying to get hisbreath and when he looked about the other canoes had vanished</s>  histools and stores had gone for good</s> now there was no need for watchfulness he could sleep and he lay downby the fire</s>  when he wakened day was breaking and beckoning theindian he set off up the gorge</s>  he had an object for his dangerousclimb across the slippery rocks and he noted that the stream flowedevenly along the bank</s>  this implied that if a log were rolled into thewater on his side of the straight reach it would probably strike therock behind which the canoes had been tied</s> after a time when the roughness of the ground forced them high abovethe water the indian indicated a clump of willows through whichsomebody had pushed</s>  he declared two white men had gone through andone had carried an ax</s>  jim had been looking for a white mans tracksand his face got stern as they climbed a neighboring gully</s>  at the tophe sat down and sent the indian to look about</s>  it the other men hadgone down again to the water they must have had some grounds for doingso and jim thought he knew what the grounds were</s> the indian found steps in a boggy patch and jim descending a ravinefarther on came back to the river bank</s>  here and there a tree hadfallen into the ravine and two or three battered trunks lay on thegravel at the bottom</s>  a hollow in some disturbed gravel at the watersedge indicated that another log had rested there and jim let theindian examine the ground</s>  by and by the latter began to talk</s> he said the marks had been made by a trunk with branches broken shortone could see where it had rolled into the stream</s>  the ravine wassteep but the other logs had not slipped down the missing trunk hadbeen helped on its way</s>  in one place the top had been lifted inanother a pole had been pushed under the butt</s>  some of the gravel wasscratched as if it had been trodden by nailed boots</s>  a man using alever would push it back like that</s> jim nodded because he knew something about woodcraft and thought theindian had read the marks correctly</s>  now and then the fellow saidcontox and jim understood the chinook word which roughly meansto know rather implied supposition than certainty</s>  for all that ifthe indian doubted he did not</s>  he knew the log had been launchedwhere the current would carry it down on the canoes and when he wentback to camp his mouth was set hard</s> after breakfast he broke up the party and sending the indians offstarted again with the two white men</s>  the canoe would not carry allbut this did not matter since for the most part she must be trackedfrom the bank and when they poled her one man could travel through thebush and overtake them at the next rapid</s>  it was a strenuous journeyand jim was worn out when he climbed the hill to the telegraph camp</s> it was about six oclock in the evening and the men had not returnedfrom work but carrie was cooking and got up with a cry of welcome whenhe came out of the woods</s>  she stopped however when she saw hisgloomy face</s> whats the matter jim</s>  she asked</s>  are you hurt or ill</s> he dropped the heavy bag of flour he carried and forced a smile</s>  doesit look as if i were ill</s>  ive lost two canoes and their loads</s> oh jim</s>  said carrie and added after all it isnt so veryimportant</s> not important</s>  jim exclaimed</s> carrie hesitated</s>  oh well never mind</s>  where are the boys</s>  youhavent lost them</s> theyre coming said jim who sat down on a log feeling embarrassed</s> he was dull</s>  carrie had been disturbed about him because he had beenaway longer than he thought and her obvious relief when she saw he wasnot injured was soothing</s>  he needed soothing since the loss of thecanoes and stores weighed heavily but carrie had made him feel thisdid not matter much so long as he was safe</s>  although he could notagree it was a comfort to know her satisfaction was sincere</s>  carriealways was sincere</s> she was quiet and he resumed in an apologetic voice i felt mean aboutcoming back like this losing the truck is going to make things harderfor you</s>  then i bought some new cookers the steam went through a rowof pans and i thought theyd save you work</s>  there was a piece of stuffat the dry goods store the girl told me would make a dress but it wentdown the rapid with the cookers</s> carrie gave him a gentle glance</s>  you bought them the rest was anaccident</s> it was not an accident but well talk about that again</s>  im glad toget back im always glad to get back now though i didnt bother aboutit much when we camped in the bush before</s> carrie took off the lid of a cookingpot and while she was occupied thepackers arrived with their loads</s>  soon afterwards jake and the othermen came up and they got supper</s>  when the meal was over jim told hisstory and jake looked thoughtful</s> the obvious explanation is the freighter tried to stop you by turningloose the log he said</s>  i dont know if we ought to count on thisbut well take it first</s> im doubtful jim replied</s>  somehow i feel the fellow was bluffinghe wanted to scare me so id agree to his terms</s>  although i reckon hemeant to charge me high when i came to him next time i dont think hesent the log down</s>  i havent much ground for the conclusion but thereit is</s> in some ways youre not a fool jake remarked with a twinkle</s>  iveknown judgments you hadnt much ground for turn out sound</s>  very wellwe come to the big contractors</s>  did they hire somebody to stop you</s> it looks like that but i imagine martins playing straight and hedeclared the cartner people wouldnt use a crooked plan</s> then who did try to stop you</s> jim shrugged and his face got hard</s>  i dont know yet</s>  we must wait</s> very well said jake</s>  well trust our luck and hold on while wecan although i expect it wont be very long</s> jim did not answer</s>  he was tired and now the reaction from the strainhad begun was glad to indulge his bodily and mental lassitude</s>  thespringy branches on which he lay were comfortable and the camp withthe red firelight flickering on the trunks and carrie sitting by thehearthlogs had a curious charm</s>  she so to speak dominated thetranquil picture and gave her rude surroundings a homelike touch</s>  onother expeditions when carrie was not there jim had thought about hiscamp as a place at which one slept</s>  now it was something else a placefrom which one drew strength and cheerfulness</s>  there was somethingstrangely intimate about it he was glad to get back</s> chapter xia confidential talkshortly after jims return a prospector stopped one evening at thecamp</s> there was some mail for you at the settlement and as i figured onusing your line to get into the bush i brought the packet along hesaid</s> carrie gave him supper and when he joined the other men jim opened thepacket</s>  in the evening they had leisure for rest and talk and afterthe strain and bustle of the day jim enjoyed the quiet hour</s>

down the letterhe had given her</s> carrie smiled</s>  she is getting on very well</s>  my cousin keeps storesatisfactorily and i dont know if im pleased or not</s>  its nice tofeel youre wanted and

rejoined</s>  im not sure id have minded much ifmother had owned that belle breaks things and sometimes forgets howmany cents go to the dollar when she makes up a bill</s>  spose im meanbut belle does break things</s> you are never mean and i was quite sincere</s> perhaps you found new buttons on your overalls and that accounted forsomething</s> jim half consciously moved his hand to his jacket and then stopped</s> im afraid i didnt know the buttons were there</s>  after all it oughtto persuade you of my sincerity</s> sometimes im not certain if you are nice or not</s>  but is thereanything important in your letters</s> one or two people want to know when we mean to pay our bills imsorry we cant satisfy their curiosity just yet</s>  then theres a letterfrom baumstein</s>  hell give us an

the things puzzling</s>  i cant see whybaumsteins fixed on buying a claim that nobody else wants but you canreckon it a sure snap for him when he makes a deal</s>  theres thepuzzle</s>  the ore is pretty good but thats all</s>  we were kind ofdisappointed by the assay</s>  the specimens looked better than theanalysis proved</s> i was certainly disappointed and surprised jim agreed</s>  suppose weask the prospector about it</s>  he has tested a good many mineral claims</s> they waited until the prospector returned to the camp when jake gavehim some bits of broken rock</s> feel those and tell me what you think about the metal they carry hesaid</s> the other examined the specimens and weighed them in his hand</s> if youve got much rock like that its a pretty good claim</s> do you reckon the stuff would come up to assay</s>  jake asked givinghim the analysts report</s> the prospector looked at him rather hard</s>  come up to assay</s>  if thebulks like these specimens it ought to pan out better than thefigures show</s> he stated his grounds for believing this and jake knitted his brows</s> i expect you know the big mining men and what theyre doing</s>  have youheard if baumstein is looking for northern copper</s> he bought a claim called the darien not long since</s> jim smiled</s>  the darien</s>  the next block to ours but the vein beginsto peter out before it crosses their boundary</s> when baumstein gets the next block you want to sell him your lot orwatch out the prospector rejoined</s>  if he cant buy you up hellmake trouble for you</s>  i reckon he knew what kind of ore the darienboys had got</s> yes said jim i imagined something like that</s> he said no more about the mine and next morning the prospector resumedhis journey</s>  after this for a week or two nothing broke the monotonyof their strenuous toil until one day martin and his packers arrived</s> im going down to the settlements and thought id strike your camp andstop a night he said</s>  the woods get lonesome and your lines apretty good route to the pack trail</s> jim was somewhat surprised but he took martin to jake and went to tellcarrie</s> i wanted to see that man and you had better leave him to me shesaid</s>  to begin with ill give him the best supper i know how tocook</s>  get busy and fix the fire while i see what weve got thatsextra nice</s> if you get after him hes bound to give in jim remarked</s>  howeveri want you to study the fellow and tell me what you think</s> then you would trust my judgment</s> of course</s>  in many ways its as good as ours</s> carrie laughed</s>  sometimes she said youre very modest jim</s> martin ate a remarkably good supper and afterwards talked to carriewith obvious satisfaction</s>  like the most part of the men who venturemuch in the wilds he was marked by a grave quietness but he had forall that a touch of humor</s>  by and by he turned to jim and asked howare you getting on</s>  have you struck fresh trouble since i saw you</s> jim related his adventure at the rapid and martin gave him a keenglance</s>  i reckon you had an object for telling me but i dont quiteget it</s>  you think i hired the man who sent down the log or you know ididnt</s> he knows you didnt carrie declared</s> thank you said martin</s>  i imagine what you say goes at this camp</s> some way</s>  i belong to the firm</s> it goes all the way said jim</s>  i often think miss winter is reallythe head of the firm</s> martins eyes twinkled</s>  well youre both making good ive beenlooking at the line youve cleared and ive not often struck a supperlike this in the bush</s>  makes me feel i want to fire my cook</s>  thenhis tone got grave</s>  anyhow i had nothing to do with wrecking yourcanoes and dont think the freighter had</s>  you see i sometimes hiresomas hell put the screw to you if he reckons you can be bluffed buthes not a crook</s> then we can rule him out said carrie</s>  i imagine you dont makemistakes</s> making mistakes about trusting folks sometimes costs you high martinremarked</s>  he looked at her thoughtfully and then smiled</s>  one couldtrust you all the time</s> well said carrie i suppose i gave you a lead but theres no usein our trying who could be nicest because id certainly beat you</s>  iexpect you dont often try and its a girls business</s> in the meantime jim had studied both</s>  he thought he knew carriesworth but somehow the others approval made it plainer</s>  althoughmartins humorous frankness jarred jim recognized its note ofsincerity</s>  on the whole he liked martin but he would sooner carriedid not play up to the fellow</s>  by and by martin turned to him</s> when i was last at vancouver a man called mordaunt asked somequestions about you</s> mordaunt</s>  said jim with a puzzled look</s> he stopped at your telegraph shack</s> oh yes i only met him once before and didnt learn his name</s>  whatdid he want to know</s> all i could tell him about you</s>  he was something of a highbrowenglishman and used tact but i reckoned he was keen on finding outwhat kind of man you were</s> you couldnt tell him much</s> that is so said martin rather dryly</s>  in fact i didnt try</s> oh well its not important jim replied</s>  perhaps my books rousedhis curiosity</s>  they were not the books hed imagine a telegraphlinesman would read</s>  but did he tell you much about himself</s> he did not</s>  an englishman like that doesnt talk about himself</s> jim agreed carelessly but was thoughtful afterwards and when martinwent off with jake stopped by the fire and mused</s>  after a time helooked up and saw carrie sitting in the shadow</s>  now and then theflickering light touched her face and he thought she studied him</s> i suppose youre thinking about that englishman</s>  she said</s> yes</s>  its rather strange he asked martin about me</s> perhaps he knows your relations</s> it looks like that jim agreed</s> and he was with the girl you met at the restaurant</s>  i expect she wasa relation of his</s>  arent you curious</s> jim imagined carrie was curious but one could be frank with her andhe wanted to formulate his thoughts</s> in a way i am curious he admitted</s>  i would like to see the girlagain</s>  still i think its really as a type she interests me</s> carrie smiled</s>  it isnt as a type a girl gets interesting jim</s> it would be ridiculous to think about her in any other way</s>  ive hadnothing to do with girls like that shes the first ive met</s> oh well said carrie</s>  dont you want to learn something about yourenglish relations</s> no said jim in a thoughtful voice</s>  in a sense im half afraid</s> afraid</s>  said carrie</s> he was silent for a few moments and then resumed on the whole ivebeen happy</s>  i feel ive got my proper job and am satisfied</s>  for allthat when those englishmen talked to me at the shack i had a strangenotion that i knew things they knew and belonged to a world i hadntlived in yet</s>  sometimes at mcgill i got a kind of restlessness thatmade me want to see the old country</s>  i fought against it</s> why did you fight</s> for one thing its obvious i belong where i am i can make good inthis country i know my job</s>  something pulls another way but i dontwant to go</s> ah said carrie i think i understand</s>  still theres theadventure jim</s>  and if you didnt like it in england you could comeback</s> theres a risk</s>  i expect its hard to get back when you leave yourproper place</s>  then i have much i value you and jake and the boys whowork for me</s>  i stand on firm ground here ground i know and like</s>  inthe old country it might be differentdo you mean you might be different</s> you are clever carrie</s>  i think i do mean something like that</s>  ifeel now and then as if there was another jim dearham who so to speakhadnt developed yet</s>  in a way im afraid of him</s> carrie looked thoughtful but her eyes were soft</s>  jake and i aresatisfied with the jim we know</s>  still perhaps you ought to give theother his chance</s>  she paused and her voice had a curious note whenshe resumed if i were a man id let nothing stop my development</s> you have grit jim said smiling</s>  grit that would carry youanywhere and makes you something of an aristocrat</s>  so long as yourenot afraid you must be fine</s>  well i suppose i made good when i was upagainst rotten ice and sliding snow but when i think about what i haveand what id risk my pluck goes</s> sometimes youre rather nice jim and youre a better philosopherthan i thought carrie remarked</s>  she got up and stopping a momentgave him a halfmocking glance</s>  but i wonder what youd get like ifyou went to the old country and met that english girl</s> she went off and jim sat by the fire with his brows knit</s>  perhaps hehad talked too much and bored carrie but he suspected that she had ledhim on</s>  by and by he roused himself and went to chop some wood</s> martin did not start in the morning as his hosts had expected</s>  hesaid his packers needed a rest and loafed about the camp sometimestalking to carrie and sometimes watching jake and jim at work</s>  nextmorning however he said he must go and while they were at breakfastturned to jim</s> in the bush one often runs up against obstacles one did not expect</s> if you find you cant put your contract over id like you to send meword</s> i dont see why we should bother you jim replied with some surprise</s> martin smiled</s>  for one thing you had a notion the cartner people andi were playing a crooked game</s>  then youre making a good job and iwouldnt like to see you beat</s> we imagined you wouldnt like our butting in on jobs you thought wereyours jake observed</s> that is so said martin</s>  if i help ill make a proposition towhich i guess youll be able to agree</s>  in the meantime we can let itgo</s>  looks as if youd make good anyhow</s> he began to talk about something else and when he set off jake and jimwent with him down the line</s>  after a time he stopped them</s> i must hit the trail and not keep you from your job he said</s>  ireckon youll put it over but if you want some backing remember myoffer stands</s> he paused and gave jake a steady glance</s>  i like the way you havetreated me your sister is a queen</s> then he went on with his packers and jake and jim returned quietly tocamp</s>
chapter xiifirethe light had got dim and carrie put down her sewing and looked about</s> a belt of yellow sky glimmered above the distant snow but the valleywas dark and the pines rolled in blurred masses up the hill</s>  thin mistcrept out of the deep hollow and carrie shivered when a cold wind shookthe trees</s>  she was beginning to know the wilds and now and then theirausterity daunted her</s>  by and by a red twinkle in the distance drewher glance and she turned to jim</s> what is that</s> jim looked and frowned</s>  ah he said id begun to think our luckwas too good</s> but what is the light</s> a bush fire</s> jake indicated the drift of the smoke from their cooking fire</s>  as arule the valleys of british columbia that open to the west formchannels for the chinook wind from

us off theground and stop the job</s> while we waited the boys would have to be fed and wages would run oncarrie said in a thoughtful voice</s>  how do the fires start</s> nobody knows</s>  i allow it looks ridiculous but my notion is somefires start themselves youll find them burning in belts of woods theindians and prospectors leave alone</s>  some are probably started bycooking fires</s>  the man who knows the bush is careful the tenderfootis not</s> then you dont think somebody may have had an object for lighting thisfire</s> on the whole i reckon not</s>  the chances against its bothering us aretoo steep</s>  for all that id like it better if the blaze went out</s> carrie said nothing and for a time they watched the light</s>  sometimesit leaped up and sometimes it faded but it got larger and when theywent to bed a red reflection played about the sky</s>  in the morningthere was no wind and a heavy trail of smoke stretched across thehills</s>  in places a bright flicker pierced the dark trail and carrienoted a smell of burning when she filled the kettle</s>  then she saw jimwatching the smoke</s> its nearer and bigger isnt it</s>  she asked</s> yes said jim quietly</s>  its bigger than i like</s>  well go alongand look at it after breakfast</s> they ate quickly and when the meal was over jim and carrie set offwhile jake went to work</s>  it was not easy to push through the tangledbush and now and then jim was forced to clear a path with his ax</s> after a time he stopped behind a trunk and touched carrie who saw ananimal leap out from the gloom</s>  it cleared a big fallen branch with aflying bound vanished almost silently in a brake of tall fern andshooting out with forelegs bent sprang across a thicket</s>  carriethought it hardly touched the ground</s>  it was wonderfully swift andgraceful and although the forest was choked with undergrowth androtting logs all was very quiet when the animal vanished</s> oh she said im glad you stopped me</s>  i havent seen a wild deerbefore</s> they are hard to see jim replied</s>  if theyre standing they meltinto their background at a very short distance</s>  however i didnt likethe way that deer was going</s>  it passed pretty close without seeing wewere about</s> noting that the scramble had tired her he began to rub his ax with asharpening stone and carrie mused while she got her breath</s>

im not sure i get thatsometimes its hard to put you wise but perhaps slipping back wasntaltogether right</s>  i meant things were moving on and leaving me behind</s> the time i could be happy was going and soon id be old and sour</s>  ididnt want to feel id done nothing and had never tasted life</s>  wellmy chance came and i pulled out</s> im afraid you havent had your good time yet jim remarked</s> carries eyes sparkled</s>  one always wants something better jim butive begun to live</s>  ive seen the woods and the wild back country imhelping at a big job</s> your help is worth much

do like pretty clothes and think id like to meet smart people</s>  thetrouble is they would know i didnt belong where they belonged andmight leave me out</s>  do you think that would happen jim</s> certainly not jim declared</s>  girls of your type dont get left out</s> i dare say pretty girls are numerous but you have a calm and aconfidence that make their mark</s> carrie smiled but there was some color in her face</s>  i suppose youmean to be nice</s>  yet you have seen me serving at the store and cookingfor the boys</s> ive seen you nursing me when i was ill and hope im going to see youwear the smartest clothes money can buy</s>  but theres much to be donefirst and im bothered about the fire</s> they pushed on while the smell of burning got stronger and presentlycame to a rocky hill</s>  its top cut off their view but a dingy cloudrolled up behind it and as they climbed the air got hot</s>  when theyreached the summit carrie gasped and her eyes opened wide</s> the spur commanded the valley and the fire that had run through thewoods below</s>  in the foreground a wall of tossing flame threw outclouds of sparks and leaping up here and there ran in yellow trailsto the top of the tall firs</s>  it advanced slowly with an angry roarlicking up the dry brush and branches before the big trunks caught</s>  infront they were hung with streamers of flame farther off they glowedred and in the distance smoldering rampikes towered above a wide beltof ash</s>  now and then one leaned and fell and showers of sparks shotup as if the log had exploded</s> the shock of the fall hardly pierced the confused uproar and carrieshielding her scorched face with her hand was appalled by the din</s> green wood split with detonating cracks the snapping of branches waslike

when the river burststhe jam the floes grind the rocks smooth and rub out the pines</s>  youcan hear the wreck drive down the channel a days journey off</s> i thought it a silent country</s>  its often so quiet it makes onehalfafraid</s> jim nodded</s>  something forbidding in its quietness thats like athreat</s>  well it wakes up and gets busy in a dramatic way now andthen</s>  if you want to live in the mountains youve got to be watchful</s> a wave of smoke rolled about them and sparks drove past like hail</s>  afiery shower fell on carries thin dress and jim seizing her beatthem out</s>  this was needful and he began without embarrassment butpresently thrilled and carries scorched face got red as he ran hissmarting hands across the thin material</s> keep still</s>  he said roughly</s>  its light stuff and will soon catchfire</s> then picking off a glowing cinder he took her arm and they starteddown hill</s>  when they came out of the smoke he was breathless andcarrie gasped</s> oh jim you have burned your hands</s>  she said</s> not much</s>  theyre hard and i have often hurt them worse</s>  its yourdress that bothers me</s>  look at the charred spots</s> but youre not to blame for that</s> i am to blame</s>  i oughtnt to have let you stay</s> i wanted to stay</s> that doesnt matter jim declared</s>  my business was to take care ofyou</s>  in fact its my business all the time</s> something of a responsibility jim</s>  carrie remarked</s>  however ithink well go on</s> they stopped again before they reached the camp for pushing throughtangled bush is hard work and carrie sat down on a fallen trunk</s> isnt the fire moving up the valley</s>  she asked</s> it is jim said frowning</s>  fires sometimes do move against a lightwind</s>  however we wont talk about this yet</s>  he paused and touchedher dress</s>  heres another big hole</s>  you cant mend the thing</s> im afraid not carrie agreed</s> and the blue one has a nasty tear besides the stain where jake spiltthe coffee</s>  i must make a trip to the settlement when the fire burnsout</s> you mustnt go said carrie firmly</s>  you cant leave your job</s> its much more important than my clothes</s> for all that i am going as soon as i can</s>  when we were talking notlong since i began to think</s>  we have taken your help for grantedwithout reckoning what it cost but it has hurt me to see you occupiedwith the cookingpots</s> carrie gave him a level smiling glance</s>  its for jake and you andthe boys</s>  in a way youre all mine and im rather proud of myfamily</s> we are yours jim declared</s>  in fact we were lucky when you so tospeak took us under your wing</s>  you have a kind of protective instinctthat makes you look after folks and makes them trust you but yououghtnt to be cooking for a crowd of hungry men</s>  ive seen your facescorched and sometimes you burn your hands</s>  then your being forced towear those faded and mended dresses makes me angry</s> she laughed but the careless note in her voice was rather forced</s> dont be foolish jim</s>  if i had lots of smart clothes i couldntwear them while i work about the fire</s> that is so he said frowning</s>  you oughtnt to work about the fire</s> oh well its too late to bother now</s>  for one thing i have educatedthe boys they wouldnt eat the hash you or jake could cook</s>  but iexpect you want to get to work and we had better make the camp</s> when they reached the camp jim got to work</s>  he was anxious butadmitted that the fire might die out on a stony belt where the bush wasthin and perhaps he need not fear much trouble unless a chinook winddrove the flames up the valley</s>  moreover since there was a risk ofhis being stopped it was prudent to push on</s> for two days he strained his muscles and urged the men and then oneevening sat in his usual place listening rather moodily while jakeand carrie talked</s>  the evening was calm and the smoke had notadvanced although it now covered much of the sky</s>  the men had notgone to fish and lounged about the shack</s>  they were tired and quietfor jim had driven them hard all day</s>  he let his pipe go out andpondered</s>  perhaps his disturbance was not logical but his habit wasto concentrate on the work he undertook and it would hurt to ownhimself beaten and let the contract go</s>  he had not been badly beatenyet and he had a vein of rather grim tenacity</s> after a time carries laugh banished his moody reflections and helooked up</s>  the firelight touched her and although her eyes sparkledher pose was slack</s>  now he studied her carefully her face was gettingthin</s>  she was obviously playing up to jake and he imagined theirbanter was meant to cheer him</s>  carries clothes were shabbier than hehad thought but they did not spoil her unconscious grace</s>  it wasunconscious grace because carrie did not pose</s>  she looked at home andsomehow made the camp look homelike</s>  she was unembarrassed in thewoods as she was at the store</s>  jim wondered whether if they carriedout the contract and earned the pay she would hold her own indifferent surroundings among fashionable women at summer hotels forexample</s>  somehow he thought she would</s>  then a curious feeling oftenderness moved him</s>  carrie looked tired and he owed her much</s> i wish you would put down that sewing he said</s>  you are hurtingyour eyes</s> very well carrie agreed</s>  i wasnt getting on fast and when youare bothered you have to be indulged</s>  looks as if you were botheredjim</s> i suppose ive got the habit he replied</s>  anyhow i dont like yoursewing when you have hustled round all day</s> carrie laughed</s>  you and jake are rough on clothes and somebodys gotto mend</s> no said jim</s>  in this country mendings not economical</s>  itscheaper to throw away the things and buy another lot</s> where are you going to buy new clothes jim</s> that is something of a difficulty</s>  i was talking about the principle</s> youre too practical</s> oh well said carrie i suppose im not romantic</s>  unless youreromantic in the right way youre ridiculous</s>  i expect its easier tobe useful</s> jim will agree jake remarked</s>  he judges people by their talent fordoing things but you cant fix a standard for everybody</s>  he reckons ido too little i allow he does too much</s> he stopped and looked about</s>  there was something oppressive in theheavy calm</s>  the smoke went straight up and the pine twigs did notmove</s>  for a minute or two he waited with a feeling of tension and theothers

 do you mean hes rash just now</s> yes said carrie i really think i do mean this</s>
i didnt know if it was rashness or common bluff</s> jake grinned rather awkwardly and jim colored but carrie fixed hereyes on the surveyor</s> it was all bluff from the beginning</s>  we hadnt the money we neededwhen we took the contract and since then we have never had propertools and help enough</s> in fact you had nothing much but obstinacy and grit</s>  they sometimesgo far in the bush but i dont know if theyll go far enough to carryyou through</s>  perhaps you had better be frank</s> i generally am frank</s>  bluffings dangerous and my brother didntknow when to stop</s>  anyhow unless

imagine you are sometimes rash he remarked</s>  didnt you see theline you took was risky</s> no said carrie smiling i wasnt rash at all</s>  i know when i cantrust people and didnt think you would let us down</s>  all the same iknew you wouldnt give us a pay order unless you saw wed make good</s> well we are going to make good and now thats done with well talkabout something else</s> the surveyor laughed and began to talk about his journey but jim notedthat he gave carrie an approving glance</s>  next morning he went on andthe others resumed their work with quiet confidence</s>  the

something else martin resumed</s>  davies has left me andgone back to baumstein</s> gone back</s>  jake exclaimed</s> sure said martin quietly</s>  i didnt know hed worked for thefellow when i hired

impatient jake took jim to the office</s> baumstein occupied a revolving chair in front of a fine hard wood deskand gave the others a sharp glance as they came in</s>  the office wasvery well

longenough</s> then you cant raise your price</s>  jim asked</s> baumstein studied him</s>  winter had been compliant and apparentlyanxious to sell but there was something puzzling about his

got to stop</s>  you can agree right now or quit</s> oh well said jim</s>  if you have gone as far as you are able</s> may i use your telephone</s> certainly said baumstein and when jim picking up the

along and fix things</s>  well record the transfer when you like</s> baumstein swung round his chair and his face got red</s> whats that you told lamson</s>
 what does it mean</s> it means ive sold the bluebird claim</s>
then you have been negotiating with the combine all the time</s>  why inthunder did you come to me</s> for one thing we wanted to find out how much you would bid</s>  it wouldbe safe to ask another

enough said</s>  we mustnt keep you</s> they went off and left baumstein sitting very still with his fistclenched</s> a few days afterwards jim and jake waited for carrie one evening onthe veranda at

alone she said and smiled</s> jim was satisfied</s>  he had carried out his plan and it was significantthat carrie was willing to go if martin had attracted her she wouldsooner have remained behind</s>  in a way he thought it strange that mrs</s> winter from whom he had expected most opposition was the first toagree but this was not important</s> after a time they went to the stanley park where jake and mrs</s>  wintermet somebody they knew</s>  carrie sat down on a bench under a giant firand jim lighted a cigarette</s> you and jake rather puzzled me he remarked</s>  you werent curiousid a feeling that things were not the same</s> carrie gave him a steady look</s>  im afraid we were very meanbutthere was a difference</s>  you were one of us when you went away youcame back an english landowner</s> ah said jim i think i see</s>  you wanted to give me a chance to dropyou</s>  did you think i would</s> no said carrie blushing</s>  but it was possible</s>  cutting the linewas different it was a business proposition</s>  she paused and addedwith a hint of regret its finished now</s> sometimes i think youre sorry</s> carrie said nothing and he went on was jakes throwing up his job andbringing me down from the shack a business proposition</s>  your nursingme and our long talks by the camp fire</s>  did you think i could forgetthese things</s>  did you want me to forget</s> she looked up with some color in her face</s>  not in a way jim but wetook the proper line</s>  we felt you ought to have a chance to let us go</s> and now i hope youre satisfied since you have found out im not asshabby as you thought</s> oh well said carrie smiling i suppose we do feel somesatisfaction</s> then jake and mrs</s>  winter returned and they went to the canadianpacific station where jim asked about the steamship sailings</s> part iithe landownerchapter ijim comes homethe car ran out from the tall hedgerows that bordered the narrow roadand at length jim could look about</s>
 he had not been able to see muchon his way from the station where mordaunt had met him and now he hadan unbroken view he studied the english landscape with keen curiosity</s> on one side rugged mountains rose against the lowering sky but amoving ray of sunshine touched the plain below</s>  in front the road ranacross a marsh between deep ditches where tall sedges grew</s>  beyondthe marsh wet sands stretched back to the blurred woods across a bayand farther off low hills loomed indistinctly in the mist</s> jim noted that the landscape had not the monotony he had sometimes feltin canada</s>  the fields behind the marsh looked ridiculously small butsome were smooth and green and some dotted by yellow stocks of corn</s> then there was a play of color that changed from cold blues and graysto silver and ochre as the light came and went</s>  white farmsteadsstanding among dark trees were scattered about but the country wasnot tame</s>  the hills and wide belt of sands gave it a rugged touch</s> there had been some rain and the wind was cold</s> as the car jolted along the straight road between the ditches jimbegan to muse</s>  he had felt a stranger in london where he had stoppeda week</s>  he knew the canadian cities but london was different</s>  yetsince he left the station the feeling of strangeness had gone it wasas if he had reached a country that he knew</s>  he wondered whether heunconsciously remembered his fathers talk or if the curious sense offamiliarity was so to speak atavistic</s>  this however was notimportant and he glanced at carrie who sat behind with mrs</s>  winterand jake</s> carrie had frankly enjoyed her holiday indeed jim thought she hadfelt more at home than he when they were in town</s>  somehow she did notlook exotic among the englishwomen at the hotel and when mordaunt metthem at the station she had with a kind of natural tact struck theproper note</s>  she knew mordaunt was a relation of jims but she methim without reserve or an obvious wish to please</s>  if either wereconscious of surprise or embarrassment jim thought it was mordaunt</s> presently the latter indicated a low ridge that broke the level marsh</s> it rose against the background of misty hills and a creek that caughtthe light and shone wound past it to the sands</s>  in one place a graywall appeared among stunted trees</s> langrigg he said</s>  well arrive in a few minutes</s> he blew the horn a boy ran to open a gate and as they climbed thehill jim saw a stripped cornfield a belt of darkgreen turnips asmooth pasture and a hedge</s>  then a lawn with bright flowerbordersopened up and on the other side a house rose from a terrace</s>  itsstraight front was broken by a small square tower pierced by an archand old trees spread their ragged branches across the low roof</s>  thebuilding was of a type not uncommon in the north of england and hadgrown up about the peel tower that had been a stronghold in thescottish wars</s>  there were barns and byres in the background and itwas hard to tell if langrigg was a wellkept farm or a country house</s>
the strange thing was jim knew it well</s>  he felt as if he had come toa spot he often visited in fact he had a puzzled feeling that he hadcome home</s>  then he saw people on the terrace and the car stopped</s>  hejumped out and after helping mrs</s>  winter down got something of a shockfor as the group advanced he saw the girl he had met at the montrealrestaurant</s>  for a moment he forgot mrs</s>  winter and fixed his eyes onthe girl</s>  she moved with the grace he remembered and her white dressoutlined her figure against the creeper on the wall</s>  she was rathertall and finely but

who gave him her hand with agracious smile</s> i knew you when the car came up the drive</s>  you look a dearham shesaid</s>  since bernard is unwell we thought we ought to come andwelcome you</s>  then she beckoned the others</s>  my daughter evelyn andmy son dick</s> the girl glanced at jim curiously as if puzzled but her brotherlaughed</s> this is something of a romantic surprise</s>  he said</s>  perhaps itscurious but ive thought about you since the night of the blizzardwhen we came to your shack</s> jim indicated his party</s>  i want you to know my canadian friends iowe them much</s>  mrs</s>  and miss winter from vancouver city and mypartner jake</s> mrs</s>  halliday had studied the group but she gave them another glance</s> she thought mrs</s>  winter was not

touch of beauty mrs</s>  halliday felt she must bereckoned on</s>  the young man puzzled her because she could not placehim</s>  in some ways he looked like a rather superior workman but hewas unembarrassed and although he waited calmly she imagined he wasamused</s>  on the whole they were not the guests one generally receivedat an english country house but mrs</s>  halliday knew her duty

carved frame and mantel were jacobean and obviously newer than therest</s>  the old windows however had been enlarged and a wide casementadmitted a cold light</s> by and by mordaunt came in</s>  the latter was thin and dark his facewas rather inscrutable but he had a superficial urbanity</s>  jimwondered what lay beneath this and imagined it might be long before hefound out</s>  until he got down from the train they had not met sincemordaunt came to the telegraph shack and jim did not know if he likedthe fellow or not</s>  after a time there was a step on the stairs thatwent up the wall and jim looked up half expecting to see evelyn</s>  atfirst he was conscious of some disappointment for carrie was comingdown</s> by george</s>  said mordaunt softly</s> jim understood the exclamation for he had not until now realized thatcarrie was beautiful</s>  her color was rather high and her face lookedstrangely cleancut against the background of dull brown oak</s>  her eyeswere a curious gray that changed to sparkling hazelbrown with thelight her hair was brown with a coppery gleam and her dress a softgreen</s>  jim had not seen the dress before and did not know if it wasthe latest fashion but he felt that carries choice was good</s>  it wasnot that the harmonious color gave her beauty the effect was deeper</s> the girl had a touch of dignity that was rather natural than cultivated</s> she lifted her head and smiled as she went up to jim and asked as ifmordaunt was not there how do you like me</s> in a way youre wonderful jim replied</s>  of course i knew thatbeforewhen you nursed me and in the woodsbut somehow i hadntexpected this</s>  when did you get the dress</s> when we were in london</s>  i hadnt long but i wanted to be justright carrie answered with a blush</s>  then she laughed</s>  youre verynice jim but do i really fit in</s> marvelously mordaunt interposed</s>  if my opinion is worth much youlook as if you belonged to langrigg</s>  that is you go back beyond ourtimes to the folks who built the peel to keep out the scots</s> jim nodded</s>  mordaunt had said what he himself had vaguely thought</s> the fellow was sensitive and had felt the girls virility</s>  jim was alittle surprised that carrie who knew nothing about the border warsseemed to understand for she gave mordaunt a quiet but rather piercinglook</s> well she said</s>  i have been up against nature where shes raw andsavage in the woods</s> perhaps that accounts for it mordaunt replied smiling</s>  nature issavage in the frozen north perhaps jim told you i have been there</s> but i imagine you made good</s> jim made good</s>  i like to think i helped</s> i expect your help was worth much</s>  said mordaunt</s> carries glance rested on him calmly and he felt that she needed study</s> she did not speak however and mrs</s>  halliday and the others came in</s> after a few minutes they went to the paneled diningroom and jim forgotcarrie when he sat down by evelyn</s>  her color was subdued her skinfor the most part ivory white and she had black eyes and hair</s> although rather tall she looked fragile but she was marked by afastidious grace and calm that jim thought patrician</s>  this was not theword he wanted but he did not know another</s> its curious but i seem to know you she said presently</s> i dont think it is very curious jim replied</s>  you see i met youat the restaurant near the postoffice in montreal</s> yes said evelyn with a puzzled look i remember our going therebut we didnt talk to anybody</s> i brought your lunch said jim fixing his eyes on her face</s> then you were the waiter</s>  she remarked tranquilly</s> jim smiled</s>  he felt that she had passed a rather awkward test and hewas satisfied</s> since you must have waited on a large number of people it is strangeyou remembered me she resumed</s> no he said</s>  i hadnt met an english woman of your kind beforeand for that matter i havent met one since</s>  he paused and addedi expect this accounts for it</s> evelyns eyes twinkled</s>  he was obviously sincere and she felt amused</s> he was a new and rather good type she thought</s>  his figure wasathletic his face was thin and brown his glance was steady butsearching and she liked his quiet manner</s> but you had other occupations besides waiting hadnt you</s>  she asked</s> i was a miner in the north for some time</s> that must have been interesting</s>  were you successful</s> i found a copper vein and was lucky enough to sell it rather well</s> then is it difficult to sell a mine</s> as a rule its much harder than finding one jim answered with asmile</s>  in general the miner struggles with halfthawn gravel thatoften fills up his shallow shaft and sometimes nearly starves in thetundra bogs while the man with money enough to work the vein gets theprofit</s>  it cost us something to hold on until we got a just price</s> evelyn did not know much about the canadian north but she couldimagine his holding on</s>  i expect you will find langrigg differentfrom the british columbian wilds she said</s>  do you feel strangehere</s> jim looked about</s>  the long room was paneled the ceiling was low andthe wide casement commanded a view of the level marsh and shiningsands</s>  it was different from the dark pine forests and snowy peaks ofbritish columbia</s>  the fine old china and silver tall candlesticksand the flowers on the table were in marked contrast with the rudefurniture of camp and shack</s> no he said thoughtfully</s>  when one has wandered about a newcountry meeting all kinds of

somethingevelyn remarked and glanced at carrie</s>  did you meet your friends whenyou were at montreal</s> jim met us in vancouver</s>  jake brought him to the store when he wasill mrs</s>  winter replied</s> the store</s>  said evelyn</s> mrs</s>  winter means a shop mordaunt explained</s> oh said evelyn that is interesting</s>  what did you sell</s> most everything people wanted</s>  dry goods groceries sweetbiscuitsyoud call it cakeand we had quite a trade in sundaes</s> what is a sunday</s> mordaunt laughed</s>  a little delicacy you consume on the spot</s>  iimagine its sometimes an ice and sometimes a sweetmeat or a cleverlymixed drink</s>  perhaps its oftenest enjoyed on sundays and holidaysbut they dont spell it with a y</s> i must try to remember</s>  but who made these nice things</s> carrie said mrs</s>  winter with a look of pride</s>  she baked thebiscuit too</s> i dont think i should like baking</s>  one must get so hot evelynremarked and turned to carrie</s>  was it hard work</s> carrie was talking to dick halliday but she looked up and laughedalthough there was a touch of color in her face</s> oh no she said</s>  anyhow it was not as hard as cooking for theboys in the woods</s>  i did all the cooking and they liked the hash iput up</s> jim thought carries western accent was rather marked and wondered whyshe had said hash</s>  evelyns questions had been asked with languidgood humor as if she meant to draw carrie into the talk but somehowjim got a hint of antagonism between the girls</s>  this puzzled him andhe was glad when mrs</s>  halliday began to talk about something else</s> evelyn did not support her much but mrs</s>  halliday was firm</s> you must tell us about your adventures evelyn said as they got upbut when they went on the terrace jim followed carrie</s>  although hewanted to talk to evelyn carrie must not feel neglected</s>  she gave hima rather curious smile when he stopped by the stone bench she occupied</s> i allow your english relations have first claim on you tonight sheremarked</s>  you can talk to me when you like</s> a new claim doesnt wipe out older ones jim replied</s> i suppose that is so carrie agreed</s>  youre rather obvious jimbut you mean well</s> then she got up and joined dick halliday and jim felt puzzled</s> chapter iijims guestsafter breakfast next morning jim and his friends went out on theterrace</s>  the tide was full and the woods across the bay looked likeislands</s>  a line of white surf marked the edge of the marsh which ranback broken by winding creeks to the foot of the rising ground</s> sometimes a gleam of sunshine touched the lonely flats and they flashedinto luminous green silver and yellow</s>  then the color faded and thelight moving on forced up for a few moments the rugged blue hillsagainst their misty background</s>  the landscape had not the sharpdistinctness common in canada it was dim and marked by an elusivecharm</s> jim began to think about evelyn</s>  she was somehow like the country</s> her charm was strong but not obtrusive</s>  one could not so to speakrealize evelyn at a glance she was marked by subtle refinements anddelicacies that one rather felt than saw</s>  her english reserve wasfascinating because it hinted at the reward one might get if one couldbreak it down</s>  carrie too was thinking about evelyn mrs</s>  winter wassewing and jake occupied himself by cleaning an old pipe</s> its some time since we broke camp on the telegraph line carrieremarked</s>  do you find having nothing to do comes easy jim</s> i dont expect to be idle long</s>  its prudent to consider before youbegin to move</s> carrie felt that jim was getting english</s>  he had of course been tomcgill but since they reached the old country he was dropping hiswestern colloquialisms</s>  she thought it significant that he did sounconsciously</s> perhaps id better tell you how things are so far as i understandthem he went on</s>  to begin with running a house like langrigg isexpensive and i doubt if i am rich enough to loaf in proper style</s> if you want to loaf in proper style you must be born and raised forthe job jake observed</s> thats true to some extent jim agreed</s>  i was brought up to workand have got the habit</s>  well my farm rents amount to something butwhen you have paid taxes and repaired the homesteads they dont leavevery much</s>  it seems there are people in england willing to pay forowning land but that plans not sound</s> then you have another</s> its not worked out</s>  the leases of two good farms soon fall in and imay manage them myself</s>  then i own the marsh which feeds some sheepand cattle in summer</s>  the soils good alluvial like the gumbo on themanitoba plains and would grow heavy crops if one could keep out thewater</s>  well we have seen small homesteaders draining canadianmuskegs a long haul from a railroad while we have a good market forall farming truck in two hours ride</s>  the proposition however needssome thought</s>  it might cost me all ive got</s> jakes eyes twinkled</s>  i reckon that wouldnt stop you if you resolvedto dyke the marsh</s>  you didnt get much money when you got the estate</s> i did not</s>  i understand joseph dearham was not rich and when hefound his health was breaking down he gave some money to his relations</s> people here try to get out of the inheritance duties like thatbesides he had not meant to give my father much</s>  however i have arich relation from whom i want nothing but whom the others think iought to satisfy</s> bernard dearham</s>  dick halliday talked about him</s> jim nodded</s>  bernard is my grandfather josephs brother</s>  joseph wassatisfied to live quietly at langrigg like a small country gentlemanbernard got rich by opening some iron mines not far off</s>  josephmarried twice and mrs</s>  halliday and mordaunts mother were his secondwifes daughters</s>  she was a widow with two children when she marriedjoseph</s>  so you see mrs</s>  halliday is not my aunt</s> then evelyn halliday is not your cousin carrie remarked</s> i suppose shes not said jim</s>  anyhow since im a dearham adescendant in the male line it seems ive a stronger claim on bernardthan the others</s>  i dont mean to urge the claim</s>  he didnt give melangrigg he left my father alone and if i keep the place im goingto run it as i like</s> do you mean to keep langrigg</s>  carrie asked</s> jim looked thoughtful</s>  i imagine so i dont know yet</s>  there aredrawbacks but something pulls</s>  ill wait a bit before i decide</s>  hegot up and beckoned jake</s>  lets go and see the farms</s> they went off and carrie turned to mrs</s>  winter</s>  hell stay welllose him soon</s>  i think i knew we would lose him when you found theadvertisementshe paused and mrs</s>  winter remembered that when she had shown the girlthe old newspaper carrie had hesitated for a moment or two</s>  shehowever said nothing and carrie resumedwell i wanted to see the old country and you needed a rest</s>  the lifethey live here is fuller than ours its something to enjoy it for atime but we wont stay long although jim is kind</s> mrs</s>  winter gave her a keen glance but carries face was calm</s>  thenshe picked up her sewing and carrie studied the old house</s>  langriggmeant much to jim and she thought would presently mean more</s>  shevaguely understood his feelings and tried to sympathize although theeffort cost her something</s> in the meantime jim went to see his tenants</s>  he dined with one atnoon in an old farm kitchen and afterwards occupied himself byexamining horses buildings and agricultural machines</s>  on the wholehe puzzled the small farmers to whom a landlord of his type was newalthough they liked his frankness and answered his direct questionssince it was obvious that this was a man who knew how things were done</s> some of the tenants who had known his grandfather talked about jimafterwards and agreed that he had not much in common with the countrygentleman he was like bernard dearham who opened the famous ironmines</s> when they returned in the afternoon across the small turnip and stubblefields jim said to jake ive seen enough of the plow land</s>  lets goacross the marsh</s> jake agreed and by and by jim leaning against a gate indicated thelong rows of hedges that ran down the slope and melted into anindistinct mass on the level plain</s> theres nothing much to be done here in the meantime</s>  these folks arewasting labor and money plowing their little fields but i reckontheyre slow and stubborn</s>  it wouldnt pay to hustle them yet</s> no said jake with a twinkle</s>  i expect it hurts to feel you mustkeep your hands off but you seem to know when youve got to allow forthe idiosyncrasies of human nature</s>  its harder to use men properlythan horses and machines</s> some day perhaps ill grub out these hedges and make room for thetractors to rip a furrow right across the farms</s>  ive no use forwasting land on weeds and thorns</s> you think so now jake rejoined</s>  you havent been here very longand theres something insidious about the country its oldtime customsget hold of one</s>  then i dont know if the tractors picturesque andcutting down trees and hedges might spoil the landscape</s>  it wouldntbe quite so english after you had done</s> jim looked at him rather hard</s>  sometimes youre pretty smart</s> anyhow i cant spoil the marsh by covering it with good grass andcorn and if the thing could be done economically it ought to pay</s> its possible</s>  are you keen about the profit</s>  or do you want a newbig job</s> im not going to philosophize thats your proper line jim answeredwith a laugh</s>  lets see if the creeks could be dyked</s> they went down the hill and plunged into a belt of tall dry grasscrossed a broad tract of smooth green turf dotted by thrift and silverweed and pushed on to the lower flats where the sealavender andsamphire grew</s>  then they skirted miry creeks that gradually filledwith weeds as they neared dry ground and went home to langrigg by thecauseway road</s>  jim was muddy but happy although he told himself hehad not decided yet halfformed plans floated through his brain</s> a day or two afterwards dick halliday and mordaunt came over tolangrigg and were shown into the hall</s>  jim was not there but his pipeand some books lay about and the others sat down</s>  presently dickpicked up a book and saw it was the old french romance from whichmordaunt had read a passage at the telegraph shack</s>  he opened itcarelessly and then started when he saw franklin dearham written infaded ink on the first blank page</s>  he looked across at mordaunt andhesitated with a vague suspicion in his mind</s>  it was possible thelatter had seen the writing when he opened the book at the shack andif he hadyou look as if you have found something interesting mordauntremarked</s> it is interesting said dick and felt relieved when he heard a stepin the passage</s>  he did not think mordaunt sitting some distance offknew the book</s> next moment jim came in and stated that he was alone</s>  mordaunt lighteda cigarette jim gave him and asked if his friends were staying long</s> i dont know said jim</s>  we have made no plans yet but i imagine ishall keep langrigg</s> do you mean you had thought about selling the estate</s>  mordaunt askedrather sharply</s> i did think about it but dont know if i went much farther</s>  thematters complicated</s> langrigg is rather an expensive house to manage and the farm rents arelow mordaunt answered in a thoughtful voice</s>  have you any money</s> perhaps im blunt but im a relative</s> i have some</s>  not enough to help me do all i want</s> you mean to do something then</s> if i stay im going to put up the farm rents though i mean to helpmy tenants pay</s>  im going to enlarge the small fields alterboundaries and fix things so the land can be worked on the economicalcanadian plan</s>  the drawback is it may cost me much and i must wait forthe return</s> dick laughed</s>  there are other drawbacks and it may cost you more thanyou know</s>  in this country you cant do what you like and we resentexperiments</s>  if you meddle with oldfashioned customs youll raisethe neighborhood against you</s>  in a sense the trees and hedgerowsyoud cut down are your neighbors</s> i believe theyre mine jim rejoined dryly</s>  however i dontsuppose id bother anybody if i dyked and drained the marsh</s> drain the marsh</s>  mordaunt exclaimed</s>  thats frankly ridiculous</s> its a favorite haunt of the lag geese and in a dry autumn i dontknow a better spot for snipe</s> there you are you see</s>  dick interposed with a twinkle</s>  perhapsyou dont understand that its a serious matter to disturb a fewsportsmen</s> looks as if i might disturb a number of people before im throughjim replied</s>  anyhow i havent made my calculations yet and dontknow if my money will go round</s> i wonder whether you understand that you are bernard dearhams nearestrelation and his approval is important</s>  mordaunt remarked</s> jim pondered</s>  he liked dick and thought he trusted him but he was notcertain if he trusted mordaunt</s>  on the whole he thought the fellowmeant to give him good advice but he was a type jim did not know muchabout</s>  although he was highly cultivated jim thought he hadconservative prejudices and an exaggerated pride</s>  the pride was ofcourse not obtrusive but it was there</s> the lawyers hinted something like that and mrs</s>  halliday made itplainer he answered cautiously</s> mordaunt saw he would say nothing more and they were silent for a fewmoments until dick got up and said he would ask the gardener for someplants the man had promised his mother</s>  he wanted the plants but hewanted to think for he was curious about the french romance</s>  if lancehad seen franklin dearhams name he must have known jim was his sonand had meant to let him stay in canada</s>  lances manner when theytalked about jim at the shack to some extent justified the supposition</s> moreover while lance had gone to langrigg with the object of givingjim good advice there was something curious about his tone</s>  he wasurbane but one noted a hint of superiority or perhaps patronage thatthe other might resent</s>  all the same it was not dicks business andhe went to look for the gardener</s> in the meantime mordaunt said to jim you suggested that yourcanadian friends might make a long visit</s> i did id like them to stay for good</s> do you think its prudent</s>  mordaunt asked quietly</s> jim looked hard at him with a touch of haughty surprise and mordauntresumed in a conciliatory voice perhaps im getting on dangerousground but i mean well and if you dont see</s>  to begin with haveyou thought about marrying miss winter</s> i have not</s>  im certain she has not thought about marrying me</s> no doubt you know mordaunt agreed with some dryness</s>  for allthat my inquiry was perhaps justified</s>  the girl is unformed butshes beautiful and i think shes clever</s> you can leave miss winter out</s>  now i suppose you have cleared theground and theres something else</s> mordaunt made a deprecatory gesture</s>  ill be frank because i dontwant you to make mistakes</s>  if you are going to stay at langrigg youowe something to the family and yourself</s>  a country gentleman hassocial duties and much depends on what your neighbors think about youat first</s>  very well</s>  your canadian friends wear the stamp of the rankto which they belong it was hardly necessary for mrs</s>  winter to statethat she had kept a small store</s>  these are not the kind of people yourneighbors would like to receive</s>  then bernard dearhams family prideis known i imagine he largely persuaded your grandfather to alter hiswill</s> jim got up and his face was quietly stern</s> langrigg is mine my grandfather gave it to me without my asking forthe gift he said</s>  i owe my relations nothing and dont acknowledgebernard dearhams rule</s>  none of you bothered about my father you wereglad to leave him and me alone</s>  i had no claim on my canadian friendsand they had nothing to gain but they nursed me when i was ill and mypartner stood by me in the blizzards and cold of the north</s>  now youask me to turn them down because theyre not the people neighbors idont know would like to meet</s>  do you think i will agree</s> mordaunt shrugged and forced a smile</s>  oh well in a sense i supposeyour attitude is correct</s>  there is obviously nothing more to be said</s> dick came in soon afterwards and mordaunt went off with him but he hadgiven jim a jar and the latter walked about the terrace until mrs</s> winter and the others returned from a drive</s>  carrie gave jim a quickglance as she advanced</s>  she knew his moods and saw he was disturbed</s> the drive had brought the color to her skin she looked very fresh andher step was light</s>  jim felt savage as he remembered mordauntspatronizing remark</s>  carrie was beautiful</s> has something been bothering you jim</s>  she asked</s> it is not important he replied</s>  if you own land in this countryit seems you must submit to a number of ridiculous rules and folkswont leave you alone</s>  however did you like the town</s> we were charmed</s>  its a quaint old place and the country round is sogreen and quiet</s>  everythings smooth and wellkept the trees look asif somebody had taught them how they ought to grow</s>  you feel as if allthe rough work had been done long since and folks have only to takecare of things</s>  i like it all</s> then you will be satisfied to stay at langrigg</s> for a time</s>  if you want us</s> id be happy if youd stay for good</s> carrie said nothing for a moment and then smiled</s> thats impossible though youre very nice</s>  well make the most ofour holiday but its only a holiday</s> she turned rather quickly and joined mrs</s>  winter who was going intothe house</s> chapter iiimordaunt pondersit was raining and mordaunt stood by an open window in mrs</s>  hallidaysdrawingroom at whitelees</s>  a smell of stocks came in and across thelawn rows of dahlias phlox and autumn lilies made a belt of glowingcolor against a dark yew hedge</s>  the hedge was neatly clipped and theturf was very smooth</s>  by and by mordaunt turned and glanced about theroom which he knew well</s>  whitelees was modern and although mrs</s> halliday sometimes grumbled about her poverty its furniture anddecoration indicated extravagance</s>  mordaunt however thought therewas too much ornament and doubted if some of the pottery was genuine</s> the room was pretty but he was a connoisseur and was not satisfiedwith prettiness</s>  he liked langrigg better than whitelees</s>  langriggwas austere and dignified</s> mordaunt was not at all austere although he was not effeminate orluxurious</s>  he was a good sportsman something of an artist and atraveler</s>  he had talent and might perhaps have made his mark if hehad not had just enough money to meet his needs and exaggerated dislikefor competitive struggle</s>  it had been a bitter disappointment that hehad inherited very little of joseph dearhams property although noneof his relations suspected this for mordaunt knew how to hide hisfeelings</s>  he was stubbornly conservative and held tenaciously thetraditions of his class</s> presently mrs</s>  halliday came in</s>  mordaunt who knew his aunt wellthought she harmonized with her room</s>  she was a handsome graciouswoman but one felt now and then that her charm was forced andartificial</s>  after telling mordaunt to sit down she remarkedi understand you went to langrigg</s> i did go said mordaunt</s>  my visit was not a success</s> perhaps its curious but evelyns judgment was better than ours</s>  shedoubted if you would succeed</s> i believe she said you ought to go because the thing needed a lightertouch than mine</s> mrs</s>  halliday smiled</s>  your touch is not often clumsy lance</s>  butwhat line did jim take</s>  i suppose we must call him jim</s> a significant concession but he certainly shows the dearham vein</s>  heused some warmth and indulged a little raw sentiment</s>  expediencydoesnt count for much with him</s> you mean his canadian friends are going to remain</s> yes said mordaunt</s>  as long as they like</s>  i imagine they will staysome time</s> mrs</s>  halliday waited for a moment</s>  she thought lance understood therewas something else she wanted to know but he was silent and sheremarkedafter all they might be left in the background</s>  besides the girlsmother is there</s> it is hard to keep a canadian in the background and jim wont try</s> still he made an interesting statement he has not thought aboutmarrying the daughter</s> that is some relief</s>  well something depends on bernard</s> mordaunt agreed</s>  much depended on bernard</s>  the old man was rich andmordaunt had much less money than he would like indeed he had longreckoned on an improvement in his fortune when bernard died</s>  hisclaim however was not as strong as jims and bernard was eccentric</s> but mrs</s>  halliday resumedis jim able to keep up langrigg properly</s> he was not remarkably frank about this</s>  he stated he might not beable to do all he would like</s> well i have no doubt you gave him good advice and your trying topersuade him was generous</s> mordaunt thought he had been generous because if he had persuaded jimto rule in a way bernard approved and the latter made him his heir allthat jim got would be taken from the others</s>  to some extent he hadbeen sincere but he could not claim that he had done his best</s>  afeeling of antagonism had sprung up and perhaps he had let thisinfluence him</s> its unfortunate jim was obstinate mrs</s>  halliday went on</s>  hiskeeping these people is awkward but after all it will cost him mostand he is one of us</s> jim has langrigg said mordaunt smiling</s>  our duty is toacknowledge and if needful

afterwards mordaunt drove back to dryholm where bernard hadbuilt his ambitious house</s>  mordaunt had no occupation and generallystopped at dryholm</s>  there was plenty of room and although the old

was plain that mrs</s>  halliday meant to make a friend of jim and herobject was not hard to see since langrigg gave its owner someimportance</s>  evelyn was curious about jim mordaunt did not know if

some time weighed the advantages his marrying her wouldbring</s>  she was his cousin but cousins did marry now and then andsince the marriage would consolidate family interests he imaginedtheir relations would approve</s>  in fact he had imagined mrs</s>  hallidayknew his views and he could count on her support</s>  now however hesuspected she had gone over to jim</s> for all that mordaunts dissatisfaction was not quite selfish</s>  jimwas something of a savage and meant to manage the estate on businesslines</s>  the fellow was going to farm and make his farming pay</s>  if hehad been a sportsman and made experiments in agriculture when he hadnothing else to do it would have been different but this was notjims plan</s>  the strange thing was jims notion of dyking the marshannoyed him more than all the annoyance was perhaps illogical but hecould not conquer it</s>  mordaunt was a naturalist and a wildfowler anddid not think there was in england such a haunt of the lag and blackgeese as langrigg marsh</s>  now jim with rude utilitarian ideas wasgoing to drive the geese away</s> the car lurched on the grass by the roadside as it took a corner andmordaunt roused by the jolt concentrated on his driving</s>  when hereached dryholm he crossed the lawn and stopped by a wheeled chair inwhich bernard dearham sat with his foot propped up</s>  the old man wastall and strongly made but had got thin and his pinched face wasmarked by deep lines</s>  he had worked with consuming energy andsometimes indulged for bernard had nothing of the fastidiousness thatmarked his

keen</s> take me to the bench out of the wind he said and looked down whenmordaunt began to move the chair</s>  it will give creighton a job toroll out these marks</s>  the fellow grows fat and lazy

sheltered bench and mordaunt sat down bernard lookedup and asked where have you been</s> i was at whitelees</s> i expect you had something to talk about just now</s>  you and janethalliday understand each other well</s>  i dont know if you areconfidants or accomplices</s> perhaps we have made a few innocent plots mordaunt admitted with asmile</s>  however i imagine it has generally been for the advantage ofthe family</s> bernard nodded</s>  well i suppose your objects are sometimes good asfar as you see though i doubt if you always see far enough</s>  but iwondered whether you had gone to langrigg</s>  its possible janet hasmade some plot for jims advantage</s> i hardly imagine him a promising subject for experiments</s> you mean hes not compliant</s>  what else</s> i havent known him very long and would sooner reserve my judgment</s> bernard gave him an ironical smile</s>  you dont want to prejudice meagainst him</s>  well youre always tactful and its comforting to feelyoure

an old man and amunable to go to him</s>  i can leave you to strike the right note youhave some talent for that kind of thing</s> mordaunt said he would write</s>  he was used to bernards bitter

evelyn join the party that went to welcome jim</s>  bernardresumed</s>  rather a happy thought of janets</s>  do you know how heimpressed evelyn</s> i do not</s>  she did not give me her confidence said mordaunt asshortly as he durst</s> bernards eyes twinkled</s>  was it necessary</s>  with your talent oneought not to find it difficult to read a girls mind</s> i havent always found it easy mordaunt rejoined</s> well i suppose evelyn is really a woman now when one gets old oneforgets that the young grow up bernard remarked</s>  besides she hasan admirable model in janet</s>  but take me in i soon get cramped inthis confounded chair</s> mordaunt set off and on his way to the house carefully skirted a spotwhere a tree had been uprooted and the turf relaid</s>  to his surprisebernard made an impatient sign</s> go straight across</s> they crossed the freshlysodded belt and when mordaunt stopped on theterrace bernard said it will not be your job to roll out our tracks</s> i thought it would bother you if i went across mordaunt replied</s> bernard gave him a sour smile</s>  i well know my relations views aboutmy character and in the main theyre just but they sometimes go wrongwhen they imagine their rules are mine</s>  probably you have not felt itwould be a relief to plow through things without bothering about themarks you left</s> no said mordaunt i dont think i have felt this</s> youre a logical fellow bernard rejoined</s>  well for the mostpart i have been a slave to my notions of efficiency and order since iwas a boy but at times other feelings rebelled</s>  then i so to speakran loose and broke things like the rest of mankind</s>  moreover imnot repentant when i look back on the shortlived outbreaks</s>  they gaveme some satisfaction after all the dearham blood is what canadian jimwould probably call red</s>  i dont know what color yours is unless youlike to think it blue</s> mordaunt said nothing</s>  bernard was often bitter particularly when hehad gout</s>  when a servant came to help the old man in mordaunt went tothe library where he wrote a note to jim</s>  he paused once or twiceduring its composition</s>  now he had time to ponder he began to doubtif it was advisable to let jim visit dryholm and imagined he could soturn a polished phrase that it would keep him away</s>  mordaunt wasclever at delicate implication and jims blood was red</s>  perhapshowever it was not prudent to use his talent since bernard might wantto see the note</s> chapter ivan old mans capricejim went to dryholm although when he opened mordaunts note he meantto refuse</s>  a line added in a shaky hand persuaded him for bernard hadwritten i am lame and cannot come to you</s>  besides the invitationwas extended to his party and jim wanted bernard to see the winters</s> they were his friends and he rather hoped mrs</s>  winter would talk aboutthe store</s>
the evening was calm and the sun setting when the car rolled past alodge half hidden by tall evergreens</s>  a screen of ironwork cut in fineblack tracery against the light and jake remarked thats a noblegate</s> handforged in belgium i believe jim replied and they rolled ondown an avenue where sunshine and shadow checkered the smooth grass</s> the avenue had been planted before the new house at dryholm was built</s> the spreading oaks were darkly green but the beeches had begun to turnand their pale trunks glimmered among splashes of orange and red</s>  onthe hillside above the hollow the birches hung sprays of shiningyellow against a background of somber firs</s>  all was very quiet andcarrie sensed a calm she had not remarked in the forests of canada</s> there one heard the chinook in the pinetops and the rapids brawl</s> they sped past a tarn where swans floated among the colored reflectionsof ancient trees and then dryholm broke upon their view across itswide lawn</s>  for a moment carrie was vaguely disturbed</s>  she had seenmontreal and london but the buildings there were crowded withoccupants and this was one mans home</s>  jim whose clothes she hadmended belonged to people who built such houses</s>  she glanced at himbut his face was inscrutable until he seemed to feel her gaze and gaveher a smile</s>  carrie felt braced</s>  in some ways jim had got strangelyenglish but he was for all that the jim she knew and she studiedthe house with a pleasant thrill as if she were embarking on a newadventure</s> dryholm was very large and modern but it had dignity and glimmered inthe sunset between shadowy woods</s>  the stone was creamy white withtouches of soft pink and gray</s>  cornices and pillars broke the longstraight front and there were towers at the ends</s>  carrie knew nothingabout architecture but she got a hint of strength and solidity</s> somehow she felt relieved mordaunt and mrs</s>  halliday would not havebuilt such a house</s>  on the whole she distrusted them but it lookedas if the head of the family was different</s> its very fine jim she said</s>  theres something of langrigg aboutit something you dont feel at whitelees</s>  the stone is curious</s> i believe it was brought from a distance but in a sense bernarddearham built dryholm of iron</s> somehow it looks like that carrie remarked</s> the car stopped in front of a plain arch and bernard received the partyin the hall where they found mrs</s>  halliday evelyn mordaunt and someothers</s>  bernard gave jim his hand and for a minute or two kept mrs</s> winter and carrie by him</s>  when they went to dinner mrs</s>  winter was putnext to bernard and carrie sitting near looked about with frankcuriosity</s>  the room was lofty and spacious</s>  she had not seen such aroom except when she dined at a big montreal hotel but it had not thelavish decoration she had noted there</s>  at dryholm one got a sense ofspace and calm nothing glittered and forced itself on ones glance</s> carrie thought it was somehow like a church but rather the big quietcathedral than the ornate notre dame</s>  she had only seen big churchesin montreal</s> the west window commanded distant hills that rose colored darkblueagainst the yellow sky</s>  shining water touched their feet and one couldhear the sea</s>  it was getting dark however and soon electric lightsbegan to glow on the paneled ceiling and along the deep cornice</s>  thelamps were placed among the moldings and one scarcely noticed themuntil the soft light they threw on the table got stronger</s> then carrie remarked that mrs</s>  winter was talking and bernard laughed</s>
she had wondered whether she ought to give her mother a hint and mighthave done so for jims sake although it would have hurt her pridebut she was glad she had not</s>  bernard dearham did not smile politelyas mrs</s>  mordaunt smiled he laughed because he was amused</s>  carrie didnot know much about english people but the dinner was obviously aformal acknowledgment of the new owner of langrigg and she studied herhost</s>  she had at first remarked a puzzling likeness to somebody sheknew and now she saw it was jim</s>  the likeness was rather in bernardsvoice and manner than his face although she found it there</s>  then helooked up and askeddo you like dryholm</s> oh yes said carrie</s>  almost as much as i like langrigg</s> bernard smiled and nodded</s>  langrigg has a touch that only time cangive</s>  a house matures slowly</s> i think that is so carrie agreed</s>  one feels it in england</s>  ahouse matures by being used the people who live there give it a stampand perhaps when they go they leave an influence</s>  its different incanada</s>  when our houses get out of date we pull them down</s> bernard looked at her rather keenly</s>  he was a shrewd judge of men andwomen and saw that she could think</s> you are something of a sentimentalist i dont know if you are rightor not</s>  when i built dryholm we tried to get the feeling langrigggives one as far as it could be expressed by line</s>  but do you likewhitelees</s> whitelees is pretty carrie replied with caution</s> bernards eyes twinkled</s>  very pretty</s>  something new in fact aftercanada</s> yes said carrie who saw he wanted her to talk</s>  she knew he wasstudying her but he was not antagonistic like mordaunt and mrs</s> halliday</s>  this is why id sooner have langrigg because i dont findlangrigg new in the way you mean she resumed</s>  one gets the feelingyou talk about in canada not in our houses but in the woods</s>  theyredifferent from the woods you have planted and trimmed</s>  the big blackpines grow as they want sometimes theyre charred by fire and smashedby gales</s>  when its quiet you hear the rivers and now and then asnowslide rolling down the hills</s> rugged and stern</s>  well i imagine the men who built langrigg longsince were rather like your pioneers</s> carrie thought bernard had something of the spirit of the pioneersthis was why he was like jim</s>  she felt his strength and tenacity buthe did not daunt her</s> why did you make dryholm so big</s>  she asked</s> you dont think an old man needs so large a house</s>  he said</s>  well ibuilt for others whom i thought might come after me but that is donewith</s>  he paused and looked down the table at mordaunt and evelyn andthen carrie imagined his eyes rested on jim as he added sometimes iam lonely</s> he began to talk to mrs</s>  winter who presently remarked oh yes ilike it in england</s>  i knew it would be fierce in the jolting cars andon the steamer but jim insisted and now im glad i let him persuademe</s> then jim insisted on your coming</s> why yes</s>  i meant to stay at home</s> ah said bernard i think jim took the proper line</s> anyhow i needed a holiday mrs</s>  winter resumed</s>  its quiet andcalm at langrigg and ive worked hard</s>  you folks dont get busy allthe time like us in canada</s> bernard laughed</s>  there are a large number of busy

sometimes clash she said</s>  youdont know bernard yet</s>  when you do you will try to make allowanceslike the rest of us</s> in the meantime it does not seem needful</s>  he is kindremarkably kind evelyn agreed</s>  in fact his kindness is puzzling</s> how far would you go to keep his favor</s> it would depend said jim</s>  upon how much i liked him for onething</s>  of course i would go no distance if he tried to drive</s> evelyn smiled</s>  well i suppose you can take a bold line</s>  if one haspluck it sometimes pays</s>  at all events its flattering to feel onecan be oneself</s>  no doubt you all develop your individuality incanada</s> we are rather an independent obstinate lot jim owned</s>  i expectthis comes from living in a new country</s>  when you leave the citiesyou have nobody to fall back on</s>  you have got to make good by your ownpowers and trust yourself</s> ah said evelyn one would like to trust oneself</s>  to follow onesbent or perhaps ones heart and not bother about the consequences</s> she was silent a moment and then resumed with a soft laugh but unlessone is very brave its not often possible there are so many rules</s> jim felt sympathetic</s>  she had laughed but he thought the laugh hidsome feeling</s>  she was generous and strangely refined mrs</s>  hallidaywas conventional and calculating and the girl rebelled</s> i expect our host broke a number of the rules he remarked</s> he did and he paid</s>  bernard was not rich and when he opened thebrunstock mines nobody would help him</s>  when he sold his farms to buypumps and engines there was a quarrel with your grandfather and perhapsbernard has some grounds for bitterness</s>  i dont know if its strangebut while joseph dearham was a plain country gentleman bernard aftergetting rich in business wears the stamp of the old school</s> jim agreed</s>  bernard was obviously not fastidious like his relativesbut he had the grand manner</s>  this was not altogether what jim meantbut perhaps it got nearest</s> i think its because hes fearlessone sees that he said</s> shabbiness and awkwardness come when ones afraid</s> its possible evelyn answered with a curious smile</s>  one hates tobe shabby but sometimes one is forced</s>  pluck costs much</s> then mrs</s>  halliday got up and some of the party went to thedrawingroom and some to the terrace</s>  jim stayed in the hall and musedwhile he smoked a cigarette</s>  evelyn had stirred his imagination by ahint that she was dissatisfied and struggled for free development</s> well he had seen whitelees and was getting to know mrs</s>  halliday</s>  tosome extent he liked her but he could understand the girlsrebellion</s>  however it was strange she had given him a hint unlessof course she had done so unconsciously</s>  when the cigarette wasfinished he went to the terrace</s> the evening was warm and a faint glow lingered in the west</s>  all wasvery quiet except when a herd of cattle moved about a pasture

in the woods hesaid</s> yes said carrie sitting down</s>  i went north with jim and mybrother and the boys when the ice broke up</s> the boys</s> the rockcutters and choppers carrie explained</s> i see said bernard</s>  was there no other woman</s>  what did you do</s> the nearest woman was a hundred miles off</s>  i cooked and looked afterthe stores</s>  sometimes i mended the clothes</s> and how were the others occupied</s> carrie hesitated</s>  although bernard had asked her to tell him aboutcanada she imagined he wanted to hear about jim but after a fewmoments she began to relate the story of their cutting the telegraphline</s>  she could not have told it to mrs</s>  halliday but she feltbernard would understand and he helped her by tactful questions</s>  shewanted him to know what kind of man jim was and she made something ofan epic of the simple tale mans struggle against nature and hisvictory</s>  indeed for bernard was very shrewd she told him more thanshe thought</s> but when you were nearly beaten you could have sold the copper veinyou talked about and used the money he remarked</s> in a way we couldnt sell</s>  baumstein was putting the screw to us hemeant to buy for very much less than the claim was worth</s>  we wouldhave starved before we let him and for a time we hadnt as much foodas we liked</s> after all you might have been beaten but for the contractor</s>  why didhe help</s>  no doubt he knew it was a rash speculation</s> oh well said carrie i think he liked jim</s>  but we wouldnt havebeen beaten</s>  wed have made good somehow</s> still it looks as if the contractor was a useful friend</s>  did he stopat vancouver</s>  does he write to you</s> carrie hesitated because she imagined she saw where bernardsquestions led</s> we wont forget him but he doesnt write and i dont know where heis she said and added with a touch of dignity i dont see whatthis has to do with the rest</s> perhaps it has nothing to do with it bernard replied</s>  thank youfor telling me a rather moving tale</s> he let her go and when she passed a bench where mrs</s>  halliday andmordaunt sat the former looked at her companion</s> i suppose you have remarked that bernard has been unusually graciousto the girl and her mother</s>  is it his notion of a hosts duty</s>  or isit something else</s> i imagine its something else mordaunt replied</s> but what</s>  does he want to annoy us</s> its possible he thought he might do so</s>  are you annoyed</s> i am certainly surprised</s> oh well said mordaunt perhaps he had another object</s>  i dontknow</s>  hes rather inscrutable</s> mrs</s>  halliday got up</s>  i thought we could be frank lance</s>  after allour habit is to take bernards cleverness for granted</s>  he has a bitterhumor and the thing may only be an old mans caprice</s> she went off and when soon afterwards the party began to break upbernard gave jim a cigar in the hall</s> i note that you and your young relations are already friends hesaid</s>  dicks a fine lad hes generous and honest although i doubtif he will go far</s>  evelyn of course has no rival in thisneighborhood</s> that hardly needs stating jim replied</s> bernard twinkled and his glance rested on a beautiful painted vase</s> your taste is artistic it looks as if you had an eye for color andline</s>  in a sense evelyn is like this ornament</s>  shes made of choicestuff costly but fragile</s>  common clay stands rude jars best</s> jim was puzzled and halfannoyed because he could not tell whatbernard meant but the latter began to talk about something else</s> you were a miner for a time i think he presently remarked</s>  onewould expect you to know gold when you see it</s> its sometimes difficult said jim</s>  as a rule gold is pure</s>  itdoesnt form chemical alloys but its often mixed with othersubstances</s> so that the uninstructed pass it by</s>  bernard rejoined</s>  one mightmake an epigram of that but perhaps it would be cheap</s>  well i mustwish the others good night</s>  i hope youll come back soon and bringyour friends</s> jim put his party in the car and drove off feeling strangelysatisfied</s>  evelyn had been gracious and although he did not altogetherunderstand bernard he liked him better than he had thought</s> chapter vshanks dabbinshortly after his visit to dryholm jim returned one morning from themarket town where he had gone to see his lawyer and banker</s>  when hereached langrigg he found jake on the terrace</s> doing nothing makes me tired the latter remarked</s>  i know you wantto keep us and mother and carrie like it here but we cant stay forgood</s> your mother and sister can stay until they have had enough and i hopethat wont be soon but i know you jake and think youre mean</s> anyhow you can get rid of your scruples because im going to give youa job</s>  ive decided to drain the marsh</s> labors cheap in this country but i reckon its some job</s>  howevernow theres something doingyoull stay and see me out</s>  jim suggested</s>  thank you partner</s> doesnt seem much use in stating that what is mine is yours but i wishyoud get it</s>  another thing this draining is a business propositionand were partners in that sense too</s>  now well tell your mother</s> they told mrs</s>  winter at lunch and jim saw that she hesitated andlooked at carrie</s>  the girls

doubtfully if you are all satisfiedi am satisfied jim declared</s>  i imagine jake is but carrie hasnttold us yet</s> carrie gave him a quick glance and he thought her color was rather high</s> you are kind she said</s>  mother looks younger than she has lookedfor long and perhaps we had better accept</s>  but it is a big undertakingto drain the marsh</s>  when do you begin</s> i thought we might begin this afternoon</s>  however i dont expect todrain it all right off</s>  theres a pretty dry piece where i mean tostart</s>  i reckon ive money enough for the experiment and can developmy

wereback in the woods</s> after lunch jim crossed the marsh with jake and stopped where a ridgeof higher ground broke off at the edge of a muddy creek</s>  in thecorner partly sheltered by a bank of

want to pull it down</s>  the dyke im going to build starts here andthe new cut for the creek must go through your garden</s> shanks looked at his son and remarked with dull surprise hes gan tdyke marsh</s> the other said nothing and shanks turned to jim</s>  if you were lettendry out marsh t wild geese and ducks wad gan</s> its possible</s>  well raise good grass and corn instead</s>  dairy cowsare worth more than shellducks</s> but youll niver be letten shanks replied doggedly</s> shucks</s>  said jim</s>  the marsh is mine</s>  although you have no claim tothis place ill give you

and canoes</s>  shanks and his son wereragged and dirty</s>  they slouched and looked slack and dull althoughnow and then the younger mans eyes gleamed cunningly</s>  then jim saidwe wont argue about

folks would sooner live like dogs than decent citizens</s> do you think one ought to indulge their prejudice</s> i dont jake admitted</s>  it would be bad economy</s>  for all that idwatch the fellows</s> they let it go and talked about jims plans as they crossed the shortgrass where the silverweed spread its carpet of yellow flowers</s>  theytrampled through belts of withered thrift and

the marsh was something to conquer andthe struggle would absorb his energies</s> next day jim returned to the market town</s>  he was occupied for sometime ordering tools and driving back in the

the road to whitelees and smiled</s>  perhapscarrie was patient when he thought her keen it was possible that shewas sometimes bored</s> mrs</s>  halliday received him in a room that looked full of

interested</s> if you begin your dyke where you propose wont shanks dabbin be inthe way</s> the dabbin must come down jim replied</s> a question from mrs</s>  halliday led to his relating his interview withshanks and evelyn said could you not have left the old man hiscottage</s>  after all it is picturesque</s> it isnt picturesque when you are near</s>  does beauty go with dirt andneglect</s> perhaps it does not</s>  i suppose the old greeks gave us our standard ofbeauty and they attained it by careful cultivation</s>  for all that theyrather conventionalized their type and one likes people with pluckenough to strike an independent note</s>  to some extent one cansympathize with shanks because he wont be clean by rule</s> jim unconsciously looked about the room and evelyn laughed</s>  oh shesaid we dont copy the greeks</s>  their model was austere simplicitythe bold flowing line but we are luxuriously modern</s>  however itwould have been a graceful plan to leave shanks alone</s> it wouldnt have been sound</s>  you cant neglect a job that ought to beput over because youd like to be graceful</s> youre not greek said evelyn</s>  youre roman</s> then if i get your meaning shanks is a barbarian and the barbarianswho stood up against roman order and efficiency were crushed</s>  itsprobably lucky for europe the legions marched over them</s> i suppose one must agree</s>  it looks as if i must try again</s>  whatabout the king who coveted the vineyard</s> to begin with the other man owned the vineyard but the ground shanksoccupies is mine</s>  then it was a vineyard while the shanks homesteadis a hovel in a weedchoked garden lot</s>  anyhow if youd like it illsee if it is possible to leave his place alone</s> evelyn was flattered</s>  she enjoyed the sense of power but shehesitated</s>  jim was easy to understand and had gone farther than shehad thought</s>  to let him make a concession that might cost him extrawork would give him a claim and

book</s> she knew when to stop and evelyn now and then developed a rebelliousmood</s> for a week jim was occupied bringing tools and materials from the townand clearing the ground</s>  shanks gave no

dick was quiet for a minute or two and then looked up</s>  you rememberreading the french romance the night we reached the telegraph shack</s> did you see franklin dearhams name in the book</s> yes

and seeing that his step was firm she let him go</s>  it wasnot a caprice that he would not take her but when she returned to thehouse she sent jake after him</s> as he went down the hill jim thought about mordaunt</s>  the man wassomething of a puzzle and jim admitted that he had perhaps not beenjust when he accounted for his antagonism</s>  lance no doubt felt thathe ought to have got langrigg

in fact jim thought he would have been a veryfine country gentleman had he inherited langrigg sixty years since</s> lance was what horseranchers called a throwback in a sense hebelonged to an older generation</s> there was another thing</s>  jim imagined lance felt evelyns charm andalthough they were cousins he understood cousins sometimes marriedwith their relatives approval when the marriage would advance theinterests of the family</s>  it was possible that he might hurt lanceworse than by robbing him of langrigg</s> yet lance had held up the car for him and run some risk of beingkilled</s>  after all this did not clash with jims notion of hischaracter</s>  lance might dislike the man he rescued but he had theinstincts of an english gentleman</s>  then jim stopped and looked aboutfor he had reached the thorn hedge</s> a belt of peat checkered by white tufts of wild cotton ran back fromthe road and a wire fence joined the hedge at a right angle</s>  some ofthe posts had fallen and lengths of wire lay about</s>  jim looked at thewire thoughtfully and then went on to the spot where broken glass andtorn up soil marked the scene of the accident</s>  then he stopped

the neighboring ground</s>  the silverweed thatcovered the peaty soil between the road and ditch was not much crushed</s> he had as he remembered not gone far on that side before he for amoment recovered control of the car</s>  the real trouble began when itswerved again and ran across the road</s>  something had caught the wheelsand interfered with the steering</s> jim looked for a big stone but could find none besides it wasimprobable that he had hit the stone twice and sitting down by theoverturned car he thoughtfully finished his pipe</s>  the car must be gotout of the ditch but this was not important and he dwelt upon thefencing wire he had a hazy notion that the obstacle he had struck wasflexible</s>  by and by he heard a step and jake came up</s> i dont know if you ought to be about the latter said</s>  it will bean awkward job to get the car into the road</s> im not bothering about the car jim replied</s>  i want to find outwhy she ran into the ditch</s> you dont know then</s> jim indicated the wheelmarks and told jake about the skidding</s>  shewent off at an angle and i couldnt pull her round he concluded</s> do you expect to find the steeringgear broken</s> not unless it broke after she skidded</s> jake gave him a keen glance</s>  i begin to see</s>  well people sometimesfind trouble coming to them when they wont leave things alone</s>  butwhat kind of a clew do you expect to get</s> a mark on a thorn trunk well look for one said jim</s>  suppose youtake the other side</s> he walked a few yards along the ditch examining the bottom of thetrunks and presently stopped and put his foot on the other bank</s>  thenhe beckoned jake and indicated a few scratches on the bark of a thorn</s> the rough stem was tufted with dry moss and for an inch or two this wascrushed</s> i reckon something has been fastened to this tree he said</s>  if wecan find another mark on the opposite row ill be satisfied</s> they went across and after a few moments jake said here it is</s> jim studied the mark and nodded</s>  very well</s>  i think well get intothe field and look at the old fence wire</s>  i want a piece seven oreight yards long</s> after pulling about the wire that lay in the grass they found a piece</s> one end was bent into a rough hook and although the other was nearlystraight jim noted a spot where the galvanizing was cracked</s> it has been bent here twice he said</s>  pulled over into a hook andthen pulled back</s>  you can see how the zinc has flaked</s> they sat down on a bank and jake remarked i think you ought to besatisfied</s>  but what are you going to do about it</s>
 thats all in the meantime</s>  i want the manwho fixed the wire across the road to give himself away</s> dont you know who he is</s> i think i know</s>  its not quite enough</s> perhaps its not jake agreed</s>  you want to be able to show otherfolks he did the thing</s>  the trouble is he may try again</s> then it will be my fault if he gets me</s>  ive had fair warning</s> your nerve is pretty good i knew this before jake remarked</s>  welli suppose nothings to be said about it until you have some proof</s>  nowwell go back to breakfast</s> they returned to langrigg and after breakfast jim went to the marshwhere the men he had engaged were at work</s>  soon after he had gone acar from dryholm came up the drive and carrie met bernard dearham onthe steps</s> i came to ask how jim is</s>  lance told me about the accident he said</s> i expect you wont let me see him yet</s> you might see him if you crossed the marsh</s>  he is getting busythere carrie replied</s> but he was unconscious when lance left</s> carrie smiled</s>  yes</s>  he got up at seven oclock this morning and wentout</s>  thats the kind of man he is</s> then we neednt be disturbed about him bernard replied and indicateda stone bench in the sun</s>  i cannot walk far and there is no roadacross the marsh</s>  can you spare a few minutes to talk to me</s> why of course said carrie and bernard waited until she sat down</s> although he thought she knew his importance she was not anxious toplease him but she did not assert her independence</s>  the girl had anease of manner he approved and if she remained at langrigg would soonacquire the touch of polish she needed</s>  but he pulled himself up</s>  inthe meantime he was going too fast</s> i understand you nursed jim once before he said</s>  did you not useyour authority to keep him in the house this morning</s> i did not carrie replied with a twinkle</s>  looks as if you didntknow jim yet</s>  besides if you have some authority you dont want tostrain it</s> that is no doubt true bernard agreed</s>  none of his relations had sofar disputed his firm rule but he knew when it was prudent not toexercise his power</s>  you are a philosopher he went on</s>  it issometimes an advantage to use a light hand</s> jim can be led</s> bernard bowed</s>  i imagine you have led him where he ought to go</s> i wonder</s>  said carrie with thoughtful frankness</s>  the trouble is idont know much and only understand simple things</s>  still perhaps idid lead him in the woods</s>  the right way was generally plain there</s> but at langriggyoure sometimes puzzled</s>  bernard suggested</s>  well we are allpuzzled now and then and perhaps to trust your instincts is a goodplan</s>  this however is not advice i would give to everybody</s> carrie said nothing</s>  she liked bernard and was not afraid of him</s>  hetalked to her with the politeness of the old school and when he lookedamused she thought his amusement was goodhumored</s> jim was

had an object for not doing so</s> well he said i expect jim has had other accidents as youremarked he is that kind of man</s>  did he get hurt when you were withhim in the woods</s> he took some chances now and then but he did not get hurt much</s> although he came near it</s>  i heard something about your going to hisrescue one night with a gun</s> carrie blushed and bernard fixed his eyes

iwould have shot him</s> bernard nodded</s>  sometimes the primitive plan is the only plan</s>  onecan see that you have pluck enough to meet a crisis</s>  but i have keptyou and have some other calls</s> he got up and when she went with him down the steps gave her his hand</s> may i come back another day</s> of course but unless he knows youre coming jim will be occupied atthe marsh</s> i wont mind if jim is occupied</s> then come when you like said carrie smiling</s>  i think you mean tobe nice</s> in the meantime jim had got to work and under his superintendence agang of men piled

gettingenglish fast but perhaps that is not quite right</s>  i begin to feel iam english</s> mrs</s>  halliday gave him an approving smile</s>  you inherited more thanlangrigg from the dearhams jim</s>  i like to see you realize you gotsome duties when you got the estate</s> i dont know if keeping the hounds is a duty jim rejoined</s>  perhapslance was nearest when he called it a game</s>  all the same i think idlike the job</s> they began to talk about the advisability of moving the kennels andcarrie sitting quiet studied the others</s>  she saw mrs</s>  halliday waspleased and thought she understood this</s>  mordaunt puzzled her</s>  hisrather dark face was hard to read but she had got a hint ofdisappointment when he said the choice lay between langrigg and dryholmand bernard

likemordaunt he sometimes sneered politely at jim</s> it is something to know jim is willing but the post is not my giftbernard resumed</s>  a meeting will no doubt be held to weigh the matterand if jim is chosen i should not be surprised</s> then he got up and shivered as the creeping shadow touched the bench heoccupied</s>  some of the others went off along the terrace and jim andevelyn crossed the lawn</s>  they were talking animatedly and carrie felta pang when jims laugh came back to her</s>  in the woods she had cheeredhim and he laughed at her jokes</s>  now he was always kind but he forgother when evelyn was about</s>  she turned rather moodily towards the archand saw bernard standing in the gloom</s>  his eyes were fixed on thefigures on the lawn and carrie thought he looked

carrie went with him thoughtfully</s>  bernards remarks were oftenoracular he left one to guess what he meant but she imagined hisglance was sympathetic</s>  although this was to some extent embarrassingshe began to talk and when they reached the hothouse he answered herquestions about the flowers with oldfashioned politeness</s>  by and byhe glanced at a thermometer and pulling down a skylight turned tocarrie who was looking at the patches of glowing color that broke thelong banks of green</s> beautiful things but fragile and they have no smell he said</s>  isuppose we grow them because they cost us much</s>  the flowers of thebleak north are sweet</s> by and by jim came in and after a glance about exclaimed these arevery fine</s> you have an eye for color bernard remarked</s>  their beautys almostinsolent i dont know if its strange that they are foulfeeders andthrive on rottenness</s>  sometimes i think id give them all for thecloudberry bloom i trampled on

make allowances for an old mansinconsistency</s>  he turned as a car began to throb and smiled atcarrie</s>  one mustnt keep the engine running and i expect the othersare waiting</s>  come back soon and cheer me up</s> he went with them to the steps and when they drove off jim wasthoughtful for a few minutes</s>  he was glad bernard liked carrie butperhaps it was strange he had not urged evelyn

smokingroom at ahouse on the rolling ground where the hills dip to the seaboard plain</s> three were rather fat grayhaired and solemn and one was young</s>  thelatter indicated a siphon and decanter on the table when mordaunt camein</s> help yourself he said</s>  wheres dick</s> i arranged to pick him up at the crossroads but he wasnt theremordaunt replied</s>  dicks a careless fellow and i didnt want to belate</s> he filled a glass and when he sat down one of the others remarkedalan raine has gone and it is our melancholy duty to fill his post</s> this will not be easy alan was a keen

somewhat limited said another</s>  i think we have allfound it a drawback to keep the hounds near the hills since the meetsare generally held by the deep water in the flat holms</s>  in fact onefeels the hounds ought to go to dryholm or langrigg</s> mordaunt quietly lighted a cigarette and then replied im afraid youmust rule out dryholm</s>  bernard declares he is too old to take thehounds</s> but what about yourself</s> i am too poor said mordaunt smiling</s> the others hesitated</s>  they were cautious and did not want to ventureon dangerous ground but there was something to be said and herriesthe youngest man remarked after all an offer of the hounds is acompliment and its acceptance to some extent a public duty</s>  if thisview were put before bernard dearham some arrangement could perhaps bemade</s> you mean i might fill the post and bernard provide the money</s> mordaunt suggested</s>  bernard however does not seem to see theadvantage of the plan</s> herries gave him a keen glance</s>  mordaunts face was calm but theother imagined he had felt some disappointment</s> then we must fall back on langrigg</s>  the new owner is your relation</s> what do you think about our asking him</s> i imagine you couldnt find a better site for the kennels mordauntreplied</s>  langrigg is near the deep water where the big fish lie andyou can generally find an otterhe stopped and herries said yes of course</s>  but this is notaltogether what we mean</s>  do you think dearham would take the post</s> its possible said mordaunt very dryly</s>  have you decided to askhim</s> the others were quiet for a moment or two</s>  they felt they had got ahint but the hint was vague</s>  somebody must take the hounds and theycould not</s>  they resolved to leave the thing to herries he was youngand his remarks would not carry so much weight</s>  besides he knewmordaunt well</s> lets be frank he said hiding some embarrassment by a twinkle meantfor mordaunt alone</s>  choosing a master of hounds is an important job</s> would dearham fill the post properly</s> i think not mordaunt answered in a quiet voice</s> oh well remarked another</s>  i suppose there is no more to be said</s> mordaunt lighted a fresh cigarette</s>  i want you to understand</s>  jimdearham is my relation but i feel my responsibility</s>  he is a goodsort and i am not stating much to his

although hes notaltogether the man id like</s> they agreed and soon afterwards dick came in and asked mordaunt whydidnt you stop for me as you promised</s> i did stop</s>  i waited some minutes</s> then you must have come before the time</s> look at your watch said mordaunt who took out his</s>  i got the timeat the station this afternoon</s> dick said it did not matter much and asked whom they meant to make themaster of hounds</s> watson of red bank one replied and began to talk about somethingelse when he had filled a glass for dick</s>  the latter was young andsometimes indiscreet it was better he should not know what mordaunthad said</s> by and by two or three went off to the billiardroom and herries saidto mordaunt sorry i had to urge you but i knew the others hadntpluck enough and meant to leave the thing to me</s>  their notion was ididnt count and you wouldnt resent my remarks</s>  rather an awkwardjob but we felt we could trust you</s>  all the same i like jim andexpect hell be popular when we get to know him</s>  in fact i imagineid have let him take the hounds</s> hed have jolted the others badly mordaunt rejoined</s>  they belongto the old school he belongs to the new</s> one or two rather need a jolt but well let it go</s>  i want to watchdicks game hes been playing well and using a new stroke</s> they went to the billiardroom and stayed until the party broke

 he paused and looked atmordaunt hard</s>  its curious but i imagined hodson was embarrassedwhen he said they meant to ask watson</s>  why should they ask the fellow</s> hes not our sort</s> after all jim is not our sort</s> rot</s>  exclaimed dick</s>  bernard is satisfied and id sooner trust himthan hodson</s>  in fact bernards a better judge than anybody inhodsons stodgy lot</s> mordaunt shrugged but was glad the rattle of the engine covered hissilence and the driver looked up as if to see if he were coming</s>  hegot into the car and pondered as he drove back to dryholm</s>  dicksmanner was curious and his annoyance was plain mordaunt wonderedwhether he suspected something</s>  still except perhaps for herries thehunt committee were tactful he did not think they would enlighten dick</s> chapter xbernard pondersit was getting dark in the hall at langrigg and jim who had justreturned from the marsh sat in the hollow of the big fireplace</s>  rainbeat upon the windows outside which the trees tossed their nakedbranches against the lowering sky and a cold wind wailed about theancient walls</s>  oak logs snapped in the grate and carrie sat on the rugin the flickering light</s>  she was toasting muffins and a silver teapotand some cups stood on the low table in front of mrs</s>  winter</s>  now thedays were getting cold and short tea by the hearth was a popularfunction</s>  carrie buttered a muffin and gave it jim on the end of thefork</s> jake must wait for the next</s>  i cant toast the things fast enough forhim she said</s>  theyre quite nice if you eat them hot but theyrenot like the flapjacks i made in the woods</s>  after all we had somepretty good times on the new line hadnt we jim</s>  mother doesntknow she wasnt there</s> i was not said mrs</s>  winter</s>  if you had taken me along i wouldntbe with you now</s>  a roof that keeps out the rain a warm room and acomfortable chair are good enough for me</s> youd have said for mine not long since</s>  looks as if we were allgetting english carrie replied</s>  jim was very nice when he got youthe chair</s>  its up against all the other things</s>  if i was jim idhate to have it around</s> jim laughed</s>  he had sent to london for the american springrockingchair that clashed with the old oak in the hall but it was apattern mrs</s>  winter liked and he was satisfied</s>  he ate his muffinsilently for he was tired and carries remarks had wakened memoriesof other fires that burned among the tall straight trunks in thecanadian wilds he thought he could hear the snowfed river brawl andsmell the smoke that drifted in blue wreaths about the lonely camp</s> carrie had laughed and bantered him then and he had been happy</s>  he washappy now and hoped to be happier yet but carrie was often quiet andhe had a puzzling feeling that he had lost something he could notrecapture</s> presently she picked up a local newspaper and lighted a candle with ashade</s>  the light only spread a yard or two but it touched the pageshe folded back and sparkled in her hair</s> they have got a master for the otterhounds</s>  she exclaimed and thenher color rose and her eyes went hard</s>  i dont know the committeebut if the others are like hodson theyre solemn old fools</s> id rather have liked the post but it doesnt matter much said jimand added with a smile now youre like the carrie who went northwith us</s> bernard meant you to have the hounds hes a dear although somestupid people are afraid of him carrie went on</s>  hed certainly havefixed it if he hadnt got lame again</s>  but i rememberdick went totheir old meeting and was mad about something afterwards</s>  i think itwas something about lance mordauntnow i begin to see</s> i dont think its worth while your bothering about the thing</s> dont interrupt</s>  said carrie</s>  im going to talk</s>  lance doesntlike you and i imagine dick doesnt trust him</s>

thought</s>  for that matter he has hinted thathe is satisfied with langrigg</s>  independence like his is not common andperhaps ought to be indulged</s> mrs</s>  halliday was disturbed but bernard did not seem to be curiousabout her feelings and resumed in the meantime ive been thinkingabout the new brunstock hospital and am going to see the committee</s> since you promised us a donation i have brought the plans</s>  heunrolled the elevation and gave it her</s>  this is not the kind ofbuilding we want and i mean to propose some alterations</s> he indicated the alterations and mrs</s>  halliday said but it will costa very large sum</s> i expect so</s>  my money came from the iron mines the brunstock pitmenand furnace men earned the most part for me</s>  a number get hurt and itis just that i should give them something back</s>  then if we called itthe dearham hospital as the committee suggest the building would keepmy memory green and i am vain enough to prefer a handsome monument</s> in some ways it is a good ambition mrs</s>  halliday agreed althoughshe was puzzled for she thought bernard had an object he had notstated</s>  he certainly was not vain</s> of course he went on one must be just to ones relations and itwould be harsh to leave out jim altogether</s>  still you see hes rashwe have an example in his dyking plan and i would not like my moneysquandered</s>  i expect you know he has lost much of his in a canadianspeculation</s> mrs</s>  halliday did not know and got something of a jar</s>  she gavebernard a quick and rather anxious glance</s> but if he has lost his your gift would be more needful</s> bernard made a sign of disagreement</s>  the drawback is jim might useit as rashly as he has used the rest</s> they sometimes waste money at hospitals</s> that is so but if i carry out my plans there will not be much wasteat brunstock</s>  i have been pondering some stipulations and if i givethem a proper endowment the trustees must consent</s> do you mean to endow the new wards</s>  we understood you would besatisfied with giving part of what they needed for the originalbuilding</s> of course said bernard</s>  since im going to urge the extension imust find the money</s>  the hospital is getting a hobby of mine and i maymake the endowment much larger than i meant</s>  he got up</s>  its a longdrive and i must not keep the committee</s> he went off and mrs</s>  halliday tried to brace herself</s>  she had groundsfor disturbance but she must think</s>  if bernard carried out his plansit was obvious that she must change hers</s> chapter xievelyns adventureafter bernard had gone mrs</s>  halliday talked to evelyn</s>  at first shewas cautious and rather implied than stated her meaning but by degreesshe threw off her reserve</s>  although evelyn and her mother generallyagreed mrs</s>  halliday felt she was antagonistic and this disturbedher</s>  evelyn was not romantic as a rule her judgment was cool andsound but she was human and it began to look as if she were stronglyattracted by jim dearham</s> on the whole it would be better if you did not go to langriggtomorrow mrs</s>  halliday concluded</s>  you can make an excuse</s> i think not said evelyn</s>  you urged me not to disappoint jim thelast time we went but we will let this go</s>  now he has had bad luckit would look significant if you suddenly withdrew your approval</s>  heknew it was his not long since</s> in a way i am forced to withdraw it</s>  i like jimbut you do not like him to be poor evelyn interrupted with a smile</s> well it seems to me a proper and tactful line for his friends torally round him when he is in trouble</s> one can of course be sympathetic if one meets him</s> evelyn laughed</s>  but one need not go too far</s>  she paused and gaveher mother a steady look</s>  langrigg is a fine old house i dontsuppose jim is ruined and i have some money</s>  then you have taught meto expect that i may get some more</s> bernard is capricious</s>  he has a bitter humor and may disappoint usall</s>  you have come to think refinement needful you are extravagantand could not live with an impoverished husband</s>  let me beg you not tobe obstinate and rash</s> ah said evelyn i sometimes felt i would like to be rash but wasnot brave enough</s>  i do not know if i have much courage now</s> mrs</s>  halliday got up</s>  perhaps she had said enough and after all onecould trust evelyn when she was cool</s>  it looked as if the girlsdisappointment had been sharp and the wise plan was to leave heralone</s>  yet she was puzzled evelyn had given signs of a recklessnessher mother thought new</s> when mrs</s>  halliday went out evelyn tried to formulate her thoughts</s>  tobegin with her mothers calculating caution

about jim</s>  he was marked by a certain roughness but he haddignity</s>  he gave one pleasant thrillsthere was the scene on the dykewhen she was halfshocked and yet strangely moved</s>  his physicalfineness appealed his figure was like an old greek athletes his facewas sharply cut and somehow ascetic</s>  he was hotblooded but one knewhe was not gross</s>  his was a clean virility</s> evelyn thought she loved him as much as she could love anybody forshe had not been touched by passion and it counted for something thathe loved her</s>  the reserve he thought he used was of courseridiculous</s>  evelyn resolved she would go to langrigg and sympathizewith jim</s>  then she would wait and by and by her feelings might getstronger and she would see her way</s>  she would not admit that thepossibility of learning whether jim would get over his difficulties hadsome influence</s> next evening she went to langrigg without mrs</s>  halliday who made anexcuse</s>  jim called for her with his car and for the most part shewas quiet and he did not talk much</s>  there were steep hills and awkwardcorners as they ran down from the rolling country to the plain</s>  theevening was calm and the noise of the sea came softly out of thedistance</s>  now and then plover and curlew cried a halfmoon hung inthe west and the black hills rose out of fleecy mist</s>  evelyn wasimaginative and liked the drive across the flat holms in the dark</s>  itwas romantic ground rich with traditions of the old border raids andnow as she watched jim sitting absorbed with his hands on the wheelshe felt he so to speak dated back</s>  he drove the powerful modern carwith ease and skill but somehow she imagined him wearing steel cap andleather jack and guiding a shaggy pony</s>  perhaps it was the picture ina hall she knew that haunted her</s>  one saw the shadowy horsemen andglitter of spears in the moonlight</s> meanwhile she gave herself to irresolute thought</s>  jim had someadvantages and some drawbacks evelyn saw the drawbacks plainly</s>  heattracted her it would be exciting to let him carry her away andembark with him on a romantic adventure</s>  she knew he had recently useda stern control but he was hotblooded and his reserve might beundermined</s>  yet there was a risk she must give up much</s>  she wasdrawn in different ways by romance and worldly caution

was quiet</s>  joseph dearham and others had made some renovationsin the hall but they harmonized with the crooked roofbeams and darkoak</s>  there were one or two tall lamps and another that hung by

she hadbeauty and a curious primitive strength</s>  jim leaned forward smilingas he talked to her they talked confidentially like tried comrades</s> evelyn was moved to something near anger and went to the old grandpiano jim had brought from the drawingroom when he found that carriecould play ragtime airs</s>  evelyn had a talent for music and meant tomake an experiment</s>  if jim was what she thought he would respond</s> if somebody will light the candles i will sing she said</s> the candles had paleyellow shades and when jim struck a match thecolored light touched her face and dress</s>  except for this the cornerwas somewhat dark</s>  amber was evelyns color</s>  she struck a few chordsthat seemed to echo in the distance and then glancing at jim began aprelude with a measured beat</s>  his face was intent he seemed to searchfor something in the music that sounded as if it were getting nearer</s> she wondered whether he heard the call of trumpets and horses feetdrumming in the dark</s>  somehow she thought he did</s> perhaps she was debasing her talent this kind of thing was rather atheatrical trick than music</s>  for all that it needed feeling and sheknew the old border ballads and their almost forgotten airs</s>  jim wasvery still when she began to sing for her voice and the music movedhim strongly</s>  the air was wild the rude words rang with something onefelt when one battled with floods and snowslides</s>  they told how themosstroopers rode down ettrick water long ago but human nature didnot change and hardbitten men now went out on the snowy

horses feet and harness jingling</s>  but you go back of that tothe feeling one has when one braces up and sets ones mouth tight</s> evelyn laughed and looked at mordaunt who frowned</s>  perhaps you areeasily satisfied jim but music critical folks contemptuously calldescriptive needs some talent</s>  she paused and beat out a few barsimitating a horses gallop</s>  it really does go back of this</s> never mind critical folks said jim</s>  sing anotherthe song offlodden</s> im not sure the song you mean has really much to do with flodden buti know one that has</s>  its old and rude like the borderers</s>  you knowa band would not fight but were too proud to run away</s>  they stoodfast by themselves and were shot down by the archers while the loyalscots fell round their wounded

the keys and began to sing</s>  words and air had a strangebarbaric force and jim pictured the stern scots spearmen closing roundtheir fallen monarch and their hate for the stubborn mutineers</s>

toofine to be used in order to rouse crude emotions in a handsome savagelike jim</s> ah said evelyn with a sparkle in her eyes are the great emotionscrude</s>  courage and loyalty that led to deeds

different in the morning</s> jim loved her and she was flattered by his exaggerated notion of herworth</s>  she had meant to justify his confidence but she knew thiswould be hard because she knew

was not rich</s>  thrilled by keen excitement andhalfconsciously acting she had told him that poverty did not daunther but when she came to think it would be hard to go without theexpensive refinements she enjoyed</s> with something of an effort she banished her disturbing thoughts</s>  shewas going to marry jim</s>  perhaps she could mold him a little</s>  yet shedid not know she did

had advantages</s>  novelty was stimulating for a timebut soon lost its charm one was safe if one held fast by the thingsone knew and valued even if ones standard of value was not altogetherjust</s>  evelyn admitted her cynically philosophic mood was strange butthe dreary day accounted for something and perhaps a reaction fromlast nights thrill had begun</s>  a few minutes afterwards mrs</s>

would be mine</s>  i have always paid</s> that is so</s>  the trouble is if this venture went wrong you might notbe able to pay</s> mordaunt was silent for a few moments</s>  holbrook had been willing

will not urge you and dare say you are occupied</s> the lawyer let him go and mordaunt thought hard as he drove home</s> holbrook had formerly been accommodating as if he wanted to satisfy aclient

washalfway up he began to see a light</s>  bernard had gone to town and hadstayed some time he had probably called on the lawyers who had madehis will</s>  the light got clearer and when mordaunt reached the top hethought he understood</s> bernard had altered his will and mordaunt would not get as much as heand no doubt holbrook had thought possible</s>  the hospital would cost alarge sum but this did not account for everything</s>  although bernardoften used the formal manners of the old school he had a rude vein hehad broken down stubborn opposition and beaten determined strikerswhile he

much deceived</s>  bernard had probably meantto deceive her but mordaunt thought he would not meddle</s>  he went tohis room and stopped for some time smoking and pondering</s> a few days afterwards jim and jake wearing long waders and yellowoilskins crept up a hollow in the sands</s>  it was about nine oclock inthe evening they were a mile from land and light mist drifted aboutthe bay but the moon shone through</s>  the tide was flowing the waterrippled noisily in the channel and flakes of muddy foam and trailingweed floated past</s>  the harsh cry of a blackbacked gull rang acrossthe flats and small wading birds whistled about the waters edge</s> farther off the clanging call of black geese came out of the mist</s> jim carried a heavy tenbore gun and his feet sank in the mud as hecrept quietly up the hollow</s>  he liked this rough shooting and now andthen jake and he went out at nights</s>  when one had hunted fierce gamein canada shooting driven pheasants was tame sport and the beatersfound the birds but on the sands one must match ones intelligenceagainst the instinctive cunning of the ducks and geese</s>  besides therewas some risk that gave the thing a spice</s>

thetides rising fast</s> we have a quarter of an hour yet said jim</s>  anyhow well shove onfor the next bend</s> they went on</s>  their waders and oilskins scarcely showed against thesand and the

differentnote</s> greylag said jim</s>  another lot is coming up</s>  theyll fly acrossto the marsh when the tide moves them</s> it will move us soon jake rejoined</s> when they reached the corner jim was a short distance in front</s>  thegeese were obviously restless and he crouched as low as he could get</s> jake found a hollow in the bank where the sand undermined by thecurrent had fallen down and stood with the water creeping to hisfeet</s>  he imagined it would nearly reach his waist in midchannel andthey must soon get across</s>  the beat of wings began again and harshcries echoed in the mist</s>  the geese were moving and jake balanced hisgun when jim rose halfupright</s>  the bank behind jim was low and hisbent figure was outlined against the glimmering reflection of the tide</s> then although he did not know if he had heard a noise or not jakelooked round and saw a long gray object slide out of the mist</s>  it wasindistinct and very low in the water but he knew it was a shootingpunt</s>  it drifted up the channel towards him a faint ripple indicatingthat somebody was steering it with a short paddle</s>  a blurred figurelay in the well behind a bunch of reeds and the only bold line was thebarrel of the big puntgun that would throw a pound of shot</s>  jim couldnot see the punt because he was looking the other way but it wasobvious that the gunner could see him

only punt onthe lower bay</s>  he waited a few moments unwilling to call out lest heshould spoil his comrades shot but feeling disturbed</s>  the punt wasabout fifty yards from jim and the heavy shot would not spread muchjake admitted that his disturbance was perhaps illogical but he didnot like the way the big gun pointed</s> when the punt was level with him he stepped out from the bank</s>  theindistinct figure on board did not move but the craft swerved againand the gun pointed straight up the channel</s>  jake did not know if thiswas significant or not because the current eddied but he imagined thefellow had seen him</s>  then jim threw his gun to his shoulder and a redflash leaped from the muzzle</s>  there was a splash but next moment jakesaw a dark object overhead and pulled the trigger</s>  the goose camedown whirling over with long neck hanging limp until it struck theother bank and jake plunged into the channel</s> pick up your bird and get across he shouted while the currentrippled about his legs</s> for the next minute or two they were occupied</s>  the tide ran fast thebottom was soft and jims goose drifted away</s>  he reached it howeverand they came out on the

gethome</s>  theres a hole in my wader and the water has leaked through</s> this sport is pretty good but you need a punt</s>  ill order one fromthe fellow across the bay</s> they set off and jake could not tell if he had excited his comradessuspicions</s>  jim was sometimes reserved</s>  jake admitted that his ownsuspicions might not be justified but he wondered what would havehappened had he

wore nailed fishing brogues</s>  lanceoften used brogues he was cautious and did not like soft mud</s>  dickimagined lance had reached the spot after the others and was somewhereabout he would not go

had notmuch ground for imagining they had meant to cross the bay if there wasno room at the village they might have walked to a station four orfive miles off and gone to the market town</s>  he must save himself andsince he hardly thought he could reach jims punt before she floatedhe headed up the middle sand</s>  one could cross the gutter farther onif one knew the right spot but it would mean

waited for some time behind a bowlder by the saltwater pond andthen shot a duck</s>  the report echoed among the belts of fog and afterthe noise died away the roar of the advancing tide was ominously

 i thought id carried it far enough back</s> then you didnt move her after you pulled her up</s> certainly not jim rejoined with some surprise</s>  if id wanted herto float i wouldnt have bothered to drag her up over the steep mud</s>

langrigg</s>  lance was there</s>  headmitted that he had seen the writing at the telegraph shack</s> jim turned to mordaunt sharply</s>  then you meant to let me stay incanada</s> i did said mordaunt who addressed bernard</s>  i thought it would bebetter for jim and us if he did not know langrigg was his</s>  i have notchanged my views about it since</s> that has been rather obvious bernard

education character and the life he had led didnot fit him for the position it was plain that he would rule langrigglike a canadian industrialist and break all our traditions</s>  right orwrong i took some thought for the honor of the house</s> i am the head of the house and was an industrialist said bernarddryly</s>  you talk as if you belonged to the old school but you do notgo far enough

accountable jim said grimly i didnt know you knew this</s> but one must be just</s>  lance lifted the wheel off my body at some riskto himself</s> that is so dick agreed</s>  i think he took advantage

tell us about his deeds</s> not long since i was coming home in the dark when i found lancetalking to tom shanks in the wood</s>  lance said he had caught the fellowpoaching and i thought it strange

smiledrather curiously when dick replied for he remembered his visit to thelawyer</s>  lance had known about the visit</s> ah he said i begin to see a light</s>  but go on dick i expect youhave now cleared the ground</s> dick has missed his vocation he ought to have been a barristermordaunt remarked</s> im trying to be just to you and jim dick resumed</s>  i have shirkedmy duty i trusted you

geese</s>  dick paused and taking out a plan that he put onthe table addressed jim you dragged the punt up the bank and carriedout the anchor</s>  is this sketch of the spot accurate</s> mordaunt moved abruptly but controlled himself and stood very quietjim picked up the paper and his face got dark</s> so far as i remember it is accurate</s> did you pull the punt down again or move the anchor</s> i did not</s>  i was puzzled when i found her floating and the anchorcovered</s> dick gave bernard the plan</s>  the punt ought not to have floated beforejim got back</s>  you will note the

distanceoff</s>  i think he saw me because he vanished he went down into thehollow of the creek where i have drawn a ring</s>  i went afterwards andcarefully examined the ground</s>  i think that is all sir</s> it is enough said bernard very dryly</s>  you imply that lance knewjim might be cut off by the tide and refused to meddle</s>  but you takesomething for granted</s>  why do you imagine jims danger was plain tolance if it was not then plain to you</s>  you went away</s> i knew carrie and jake were farther out on the sands and came back assoon as possible</s>  i fired my gun to warn

sooner not reply sir</s>  the thing mainly touches lance and me</s> his horrible treachery touches us all mrs</s>  halliday declared</s>  ifit were known we should be forced to leave the neighborhood</s>  we couldnot face a scandal like this</s> i imagine it will not be known bernard remarked with an ironicalsmile and turned to mordaunt</s>  have you anything to state</s> i might urge that i risked getting badly hurt when i lifted the caroff jim and that i did not move his punt</s> you consented to its being moved dick broke in</s> bernard stopped him and mordaunt resumed it is
