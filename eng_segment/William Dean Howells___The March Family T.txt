 the outsetthey first met in boston but the match was made in europe where theyafterwards saw each other whither indeed he followed her and therethe match was also broken off</s>  why it was broken off and why it wasrenewed after a lapse of years is part of quite a long lovestorywhich i do not think myself qualified to rehearse distrusting myfitness for a sustained or involved narration though i am persuadedthat a skillful romancer could turn the courtship of basil and isabelmarch to excellent account</s>  fortunately for me however in attemptingto tell the reader of the weddingjourney of a newly married coupleno longer very young to be sure but still fresh in the light of theirlove i shall have nothing to do but to talk of some ordinary traits ofamerican life as these appeared to them to speak a little of wellknownand easily accessible places to present now a bit of landscape and nowa sketch of character</s> they had agreed to make their weddingjourney in the simplest andquietest way and as it did not take place at once after their marriagebut some weeks later it had all the desired charm of privacy from theoutset</s> how much better said isabel to go now when nobody careswhether you go or stay than to have started off upon a wretchedweddingbreakfast all tears and trousseau and had people wantingto see you aboard the cars</s>  now there will not be a suspicion ofhoneymoonshine about us we shall go just like anybody elsewitha difference dear with a difference</s>  and she took basils cheeksbetween her hands</s>  in order to do this she had to ran round the tablefor they were at dinner and isabels aunt with whom they had begunmarried life sat substantial between them</s>  it was rather a girlishthing for isabel and she added with a conscious blush we are pastour first youth you know and we shall not strike the public as bridalshall we</s>  my one horror in life is an evident bride</s> basil looked at her fondly as if he did not think her at all too old tobe taken for a bride and for my part i do not object to a womans beingof isabels age if she is of a good heart and temper</s>  life must havebeen very unkind to her if at that age she have not won more than shehas lost</s>  it seemed to basil that his wife was quite as fair as whenthey met first eight years before but he could not help recurringwith an inextinguishable regret to the long interval of their brokenengagement which but for that fatality they might have spent togetherhe imagined in just such rapture as this</s>  the regret always hauntedhim more or less it was part of his love the loss accountedirreparable really enriched the final gain</s> i dont know he said presently with as much gravity as a man canwhose cheeks are clasped between a ladys hands you dont begin verywell for a bride who wishes to keep her secret</s>  if you behave in thisway they will put us into the bridal chambers at all the hotels</s>  andthe carstheyre beginning to have them on the palacecars</s> just then a shadow fell into the room</s> wasnt that thunder isabel</s>  asked her aunt who had been contentedlysurveying the tender spectacle before her</s>  o dear</s>  youll never be ableto go by the boat tonight if it storms</s>  it s actually raining now</s> in fact it was the beginning of that terrible storm of june 1870</s>  allin a moment out of the hot sunshine of the day it burst upon us beforewe quite knew that it threatened even before we had fairly noticed theclouds and it went on from passion to passion with an inexhaustibleviolence</s>  in the square upon which our friends looked out of theirdiningroom windows the trees whitened in the gusts and darkened inthe driving floods of the rainfall and in some paroxysms of the tempestbent themselves in desperate submission and then with a great shudderrent away whole branches and flung them far off upon the ground</s>  hailmingled with the rain and now the few umbrellas that had braved thestorm vanished and the hurtling ice crackled upon the pavement wherethe lightning played like flames burning from the earth while thethunder roared overhead without ceasing</s>  there was something splendidlytheatrical about it all and when a streetcar laden to the last inchof its capacity came by with horses that pranced and leaped underthe stinging blows of the hailstones our friends felt as if it werean effective and very naturalistic bit of pantomime contrived for theiradmiration</s>  yet as to themselves they were very sensible of a potentreality in the affair and at intervals during the storm they debatedabout going at all that day and decided to go and not to go accordingto the changing complexion of the elements</s>  basil had said that as thiswas their first journey together in america he wished to give it at thebeginning as pungent a national character as possible and that as hecould imagine nothing more peculiarly american than a voyage to new yorkby a fall river boat they ought to take that route thither</s>  so muchupholstery so much music such variety cf company he understood couldnot be got in any other way and it might be that they would even catcha glimpse of the inventor of the combination who represented thevery excess and extremity of a certain kind of americanism</s>  isabel hadeagerly consented but these aesthetic motives were paralyzed for her bythe thought of passing point judith in a storm and she descended fromher high intents first to the inside boats without the magnificence andthe orchestra and then to the idea of going by land in a sleepingcar</s> having comfortably accomplished this feat she treated basils consentas a matter of course not because she did not regard him but becauseas a woman she could not conceive of the steps to her conclusion asunknown to him and always treated her own decisions as the productof their common reasoning</s>  but her husband held out for the boat andinsisted that if the storm fell before seven oclock they could reachit at newport by the last express and it was this obstinacy that inproof of isabels wisdom obliged them to wait two hours in the stationbefore going by the land route</s>  the storm abated at five oclock andthough the rain continued it seemed well by a quarter of seven to setout for the old colony depot in sight of which a sudden and vivid flashof lightning caused isabel to seize her husbands arm and to implorehim o dont go by the boat</s>  on this basil had the incredibleweakness to yield and bade the driver take them to the worcester depot</s> it was the first swerving from the ideal in their wedding journey butit was by no means the last though it must be confessed that it wasearly to begin</s> they both felt more tranquil when they were irretrievably committed bythe purchase of their tickets and when they sat down in the waiting</s> room of the station with all the time between seven and nine oclockbefore them</s>  basil would have eked out the business of checking thetrunks into an affair of some length but the baggagemaster did hisduty with pitiless celerity and so basil in the mere excess of hisdisoccupation bought an accidentinsurance ticket</s>  this employed himhalf a minute and then he gave up the unequal contest and went andtook his place beside isabel who sat prettily wrapped in her shawlperfectly content</s> isnt it charming she said gayly having to wait so long</s>  it putsme in mind of some of those other journeys we took together</s>  but i cantthink of those times with any patience when we might really have hadeach other and didnt</s>  do you remember how long we had to wait atchambery</s>  and the numbers of military gentlemen that waited too withtheir little waists and their kisses when they met</s>  and that poormarried military gentleman with the plain wife and the two childrenand a tarnished uniform</s>  he seemed to be somehow in misfortune andhis mustache hung down in such a spiritless way while all the othermilitary mustaches about curled and bristled with so much boldness</s>  ithink salles dattente everywhere are delightful and there is such acommunity of interest in them all that when i come here only to go outto brookline i feel myself a traveller once morea blessed strangerin a strange land</s>  o dear basil those were happy times after all whenwe might have had each other and didnt</s>  and now were the more preciousfor having been so long lost</s> she drew closer and closer to him and looked at him in a way thatthreatened betrayal of her bridal character</s> isabel you will be having your head on my shoulder next said he</s> never</s>  she answered fiercely recovering her distance with a start</s> but dearest if you do see me going toact absurdly you know dostop me</s> im very sorry but ive got myself to stop</s>  besides i didntundertake to preserve the incognito of this bridal party</s> if any accident of the sort dreaded had really happened it would nothave mattered so much for as yet they were the sole occupants of thewaiting room</s>  to be sure the ticketseller was there and the lady whochecked packages left in her charge but these must have seen so manyendearments pass between passengersthat a fleeting caress or so wouldscarcely have drawn their notice to our pair</s>  yet isabel did not so mucheven as put her hand into her husbands and as basil afterwards saidit was very good practice</s> our temporary state whatever it is is often mirrored in all that comenear us and our friends were fated to meet frequent parodies of theirhappiness from first to last on this journey</s>  the travesty began withthe very first people who entered the waitingroom after themselves andwho were a very young couple starting like themselves upon a pleasuretour which also was evidently one of the first tours of any kind thatthey had made</s>  it was of modest extent and comprised going to new yorkand back but they talked of it with a fluttered and joyful expectationas if it were a voyage to europe</s>  presently there appeared a burlesqueof their happiness but with a touch of tragedy in that kind of youngman who is called by the females of his class a fellow and two youngwomen of that kind known to him as girls</s>  he took a place between theseand presently began a robust flirtation with one of them</s>  he possessedhimself after a brief struggle of her parasol and twirled it aboutas he uttered with a sort of tender rudeness inconceivable vapiditiessuch as you would expect from none but a man of the highest fashion</s>  thegirl thus courted became selfishly unconscious of everything but her ownjoy and made no attempt to bring the other girl within its warmth butleft her to languish forgotten on the other side</s>  the latter sometimesleaned forward and tried to divert a little of the flirtation toherself but the flirters snubbed her with short answers and presentlyshe gave up and sat still in the sad patience of uncourted women</s>  inthis attitude she became a burden to isabel who was glad when the threetook themselves away and were succeeded by a very stylish couplefromnew york she knew as well as if they had given her their address onwest 999th street</s>  the lady was not pretty and she was not isabelthought dressed in the perfect taste of boston but she owned franklyto herself that the newyorkeress was stylish undeniably effective</s>  thegentleman bought a ticket for new york and remained at the window ofthe office talking quite easily with the seller</s> you couldnt do that my poor basil said isabel youd be afraid</s> o dear yes im only too glad to get off without browbeating thoughi must say that this officer looks affable enough</s>  really he added asan acquaintance of the ticketseller came in and nodded to him and saidhot today</s>  this is very strange</s>  i always felt as if these men hadno private life no friendships like the rest of us</s>  on duty they seemso like sovereigns set apart from mankind and above us all that itsquite incredible they should have the common personal relations</s> at intervals of their talk and silence there came vivid flashes oflightning and quite heavy shocks of thunder very consoling to ourfriends who took them as so many compliments to their prudence in notgoing by the boat and who had secret doubts of their wisdom wheneverthese acknowledgments were withheld</s>  isabel went so far as to saythat she hoped nothing would happen to the boat but i think she wouldcheerfully have learnt that the vessel had been obliged to put back tonewport on account of the storm or even that it had been driven ashoreat a perfectly safe place</s> people constantly came and went in the waitingroom which was sometimesquite full and again empty of all but themselves</s>  in the course oftheir observations they formed many cordial friendships and bitterenmities upon the ground of personal appearance or particulars ofdress with people whom they saw for half a minute upon an average andthey took such a keen interest in every one that it would be hard tosay whether they were more concerned in an old gentleman with vigorouslyupright irongray hair who sat fronting them and reading all theevening papers or a young man who hurled himself through the doorbought a ticket with terrific precipitation burst out again and thenran down a departing train before it got out of the station they lovedthe old gentleman for a certain stubborn benevolence of expression andif they had been friends of the young man and his family for generationsand felt bound if any harm befell him to go and break the news gentlyto his parents their nerves could not have been more intimately wroughtupon by his hazardous behavior</s>  still as they had their tickets fornew york and he was going out on a merely local trainto brooklinei believe they could not even in their anxiety repress a feeling ofcontempt for his unambitious destination</s> they were already as completely cut off from local associations andsympathies as if they were a thousand miles and many months away fromboston</s>  they enjoyed the lonely flaring of the gasjets as a gust ofwind drew through the station they shared the gloom and isolation ofa man who took a seat in the darkest corner of the room and sat therewith folded arms the genius of absence</s>  in the patronizing spirit oftravellers in a foreign country they noted and approved the vases ofcutflowers in the booth of the lady who checked packages and the potsof ivy in her windows</s>  these poor bostonians they said have somelove of the beautiful in their rugged natures</s> but after all was said and thought it was only eight oclock and theystill had an hour to wait</s> basil grew restless and isabel said with a subtile interpretation ofhis uneasiness i dont want anything to eat basil but i think i knowthe weaknesses of men and you had better go and pass the next halfhourover a plate of something indigestible</s> this was said con stizza the least little suggestion of it but basilrose with shameful alacrity</s>  darling if its your wishits my fate basil said isabel</s> ill go he exclaimed because it isnt bridal and will help us topass for old married people</s> no no basil be honest fibbing isnt your forte i wonder you wentinto the insurance business you ought to have been a lawyer</s>  go becauseyou like eating and are hungry perhaps or think you may be so beforewe get to new york</s> i shall amuse myself well enough here</s> i suppose it is always a little shocking and grievous to a wife when sherecognizes a rival in butchersmeat and the vegetables of the season</s> with her slender relishes for pastry and confectionery and her daintyhabits of lunching she cannot reconcile with the idea of herhusbands capacity for breakfasting dining supping and hot meals atall hours of the day and nightas they write it on the signboards ofbarbaric eatinghouses</s>  but isabel would have only herself to blameif she had not perceived this trait of basils before marriage</s>  sherecurred now as his figure disappeared down the station to memorableinstances of his appetite in their european travels during their firstengagement</s>  yes he ate terribly at susa when i was too full ofthe notion of getting into italy to care for bouillon and cold roastchicken</s>  at rome i thought i must break with him on account of thewildboar and at heidelberg the sausage and the ham</s> how could hein my presence</s>  but i took him with all his faultsand was glad to gethim she added ending her meditation with a little burst of candorand she did not even think of basils appetite when he reappeared</s> with the thronging of many sorts of people in parties and singly intothe waiting room they became once again mere observers of their kindmore or less critical in temper until the crowd grew so that individualtraits were merged in the character of multitude</s>  even then they couldcatch glimpses of faces so sweet or fine that they made themselves feltlike moments of repose in the tumult and here and there was somethingso grotesque in dress of manner that it showed distinct from the rest</s> the ticketsellers stamp clicked incessantly as he sold tickets to allpoints south and west to new york philadelphia charleston to neworleans chicago omaha to st</s>  paul duluth st</s>  louis and it wouldnot have been hard to find in that anxious bustle that unsmilingeagerness an image of the whole busy affair of life</s>  it was not aparticularly sane spectacle that impatience to be off to some placethat lay not only in the distance but also in the futureto which noline of road carries you with absolute certainty across an interval oftime full of every imaginable chance and influence</s>  it is easy enough tobuy a ticket to cincinnati but it is somewhat harder to arrive there</s> say that all goes well is it exactly you who arrive</s> in the midst of the disquiet there entered at last an old woman so veryinfirm that she had to be upheld on either hand by her husband and thehackman who had brought them while a young girl went before with shawlsand pillows which she arranged upon the seat</s>  there the invalid laydown and turned towards the crowd a white suffering face which wasyet so heavenly meek and peaceful that it comforted whoever looked atit</s> in spirit our happy friends bowed themselves before it and owned thatthere was something better than happiness in it</s> what is it like isabel</s> o i dont know darling she said but she thought perhaps it islike some blessed sorrow that takes us out of this prison of a worldand sets us free of our everyday hates and desires our aims ourfears ourselves</s>  maybe a long and mortal sickness might come to wearsuch a face in one of us two and the other could see it and not regretthe poor mask of youth and pretty looks that had fallen away</s> she rose and went over to the sick woman on whose face beamed a tendersmile as isabel spoke to her</s>  a chord thrilled in two lives hithertounknown to each other but what was said basil would not ask when theinvalid had taken isabels hand between her own as for adieu and shecame back to his side with swimming eyes</s>  perhaps his wife could havegiven no good reason for her emotion if he had asked it</s>  but it madeher very sweet and dear to him and i suppose that when a tolerablyunselfish man is once secure of a womans love he is ordinarily moreaffected by her compassion and tenderness for other objects than by herfeelings towards himself</s>  he likes well enough to think she loves mebut still better how kind and good she is</s> they lost sight of the invalid in the hurry of getting places on thecars and they never saw her again</s>  the man at the wicketgate leadingto the train had thrown it up and the people were pressing furiouslythrough as if their lives hung upon the chance of instant passage</s>  basilhad secured his ticket for the sleepingcar and so he and isabelstood aside and watched the tumult</s>  when the rash was over they passedthrough and as they walked up and down the platform beside the traini was thinking said isabel after i spoke to that poor old ladyof what clara williams says that she wonders the happiest women in theworld can look each other in the face without bursting into tears theirhappiness is so unreasonable and so built upon and hedged about withmisery</s>  she declares that theres nothing so sad to her as a brideunless its a young mother or a little girl growing up in the innocentgayety of her heart</s>  she wonders they can live through it</s> clara is very much of a reformer and would make an end of all of usmen i supposeexcept her father who supports her in the leisurethat enables her to do her deep thinking</s>  she little knows what we poorfellows have to suffer and how often we break down in business hoursand sob upon one anothers necks</s>  did that old lady talk to you in thesame strain</s> o no</s>  she spoke very calmly of her sickness and said she had lived ablessed life</s>  perhaps it was that made me shed those few small tears</s> she seemed a very religious person</s> yes said basil it is almost a pity that religion is going out</s>  butthen you are to have the franchise</s> all aboard</s> this warning cry saved him from whatever heresy he might have beenabout to utter and presently the train carried them out into thegassprinkled darkness with an evergrowing speed that soon leftthe city lamps far behind</s>  it is a phenomenon whose commonnessalone prevents it from being most impressive that departure of thenightexpress</s>  the two hundred miles it is to travel stretch before ittraced by those slender clews to lose which is ruin and about whichhang so many dangers</s>  the draw bridges that gape upon the way thetrains that stand smoking and steaming on the track the rail that hasborne the wear so long that it must soon snap under it the deep cutwhere the overhanging mass of rock trembles to its fall the obstructionthat a pitiless malice may have placed in your pathyou think of theseafter the journey is done but they seldom haunt your fancy while itlasts</s>  the knowledge of your helplessness in any circumstances is soperfect that it begets a sense of irresponsibility almost of securityand as you drowse upon the pallet of the sleeping car and feel yourselfhurled forward through the obscurity you are almost thankful that youcan do nothing for it is upon this condition only that you can endureit and some such condition as this i suppose accounts for many heroicfacts in the world</s>  to the fantastic mood which possesses you equallysleeping or waking the stoppages of the train have a weird characterand worcester springfield new haven and stamford are rather points indreamland than wellknown towns of new england</s>  as the train stops youdrowse if you have been waking and wake if you have been in a doze butin any case you are aware of the locomotive hissing and coughing beyondthe station of flaring gasjets of clattering feet of passengersgetting on and off then of some one conductor or stationmasterwalking the whole length of the train and then you are aware of aninsane satisfaction in renewed flight through the darkness</s>  you thinkhazily of the folk in their beds in the town left behind who stiruneasily at the sound of your trains departing whistle and so all is ablank vigil or a blank slumber</s> by daylight basil and isabel found themselves at opposite ends of thecar struggling severally with the problem of the mornings toilet</s> when the combat was ended they were surprised at the decency of theirappearance and isabel said i think im presentable to an earlybroadway public and ive a fancy for not going to a hotel</s>  lucy will beexpecting us out there before noon and we can pass the time pleasantlyenough for a few hours just wandering about</s> she was a woman who loved any cheap defiance of custom and she had anagreeable sense of adventure in what she proposed</s>  besides she feltthat nothing could be more in the unconventional spirit in which theymeant to make their whole journey than a stroll about new york athalfpast six in the morning</s> delightful</s>  answered basil who was always charmed with these smalloriginalities</s>  you look well enough for an evening party and besidesyou wont meet one of your own critical class on broadway at this hour</s> we will breakfast at one of those gilded metropolitan restaurantsand then go round to leonards who will be able to give us just threeunhurried seconds</s>  after that well push on out to his place</s> at that early hour there were not many people astir on the wide avenuedown which our friends strolled when they left the station but in theaspect of those they saw there was something that told of a greaterheat than they had yet known in boston and they were sensible of havingreached a more southern latitude</s>  the air though freshened by theovernights storm still wanted the briskness and sparkle and pungencyof the boston air which is as delicious in summer as it is terriblein winter and the faces that showed themselves were sodden from theyesterdays heat and perspiration</s>  a cornergrocer seated in a sort offierce despondency upon a keg near his shop door

they had yielded sufficiently to circumstances and conditionsalready on this journey and she was resolved that the present halfdayin new york should be the halfday of her original design</s> it was not the most advisable thing as i have allowed but it wasinevitable and it afforded them a spectacle which is by no meanswanting in sublimity and which is certainly uniquethe spectacle ofthat great

let it not be a reproach to human nature or to me if i saythat there was something in the comfort of having well dined which nowtouched the springs of sentiment with magical effect and that they hadnever so rejoiced in these tender reminiscences</s> they had planned to stop over at rochester till the morrow that theymight arrive at niagara by daylight and at utica they had suddenlyresolved to make the rest of the days journey in a drawingroom car</s> the change gave them an added reason for content and they realized howmuch they had previously sacrificed to the idea of travelling in

named it there steppedforth a porter of an incredibly cordial and pleasant countenance whotook their travellingbags and led them to the omnibus</s>  as they werehis only passengers the porter got inside with them and seeing theirinterest in the streets through which they rode he descanted in astrain of cheerful pride upon the citys prosperity and character andgave the names of the people who lived in the finer houses just as ifit had been an oldworld town and he some eager historian expectingreward for his comment upon it</s>  he cast quite a glamour over rochesterso that in passing a body of water bordered by houses and overlookedby odd balconies and galleries and crossed in the distance by a bridgeupon which other houses were built they boldly declared being attheir wits end for

it seemed useless toprotest and like a true american like you like me he shrank fromasserting himself</s>  when the sun went down it would be cool enough andthey turned their thoughts to supper not venturing to hope that as itproved the handsome clerk was the sole blemish of the house</s> isabel viewed with innocent surprise the evidences of luxury affordedby all the appointments of a hotel so far west of boston and they bothbegan to feel that natural ease and superiority which an inn alwaysinspires in its guests and which our great hotels far from impairingenhance in flattering degree in

cheap kind of raillery to be sure but it served</s>  it kindledthe local pride of isabel to selfdefense and in the distraction of theeffort she forgot her fears she returned with renewed appetite to thesupper and in its excellence they both let fall their disputewhichended of course in basils abject confession that boston was thebest place in the world and nothing but banishment could make him liveelsewhereand gave themselves up as usual to the delight of beingjust what and where they were</s>  at last the natural course broughtthem to the strawberries and when the fifth waiter approached from thecorner of the table at which he stood to place the vase near them hedid not retire at once but presently asked if they were from the west</s> isabel smiled and basil answered that they were from the east</s> he faltered at this as if doubtful of the result if he went furtherbut took heart then and asked dont you think this is a pretty nicehotelhastily adding as a concession of the probable existence of muchfiner things at the eastfor a small hotel</s> they imagined this waiter as new to his station in life as perhapsjust risen to it from some country tavern and unable to repress hisexultation in what seemed their sympathetic presence</s>  they were charmedto have invited his guileless confidence to have evoked possibly allthe simple poetry of his soul it was what might have happened in italyonly there so much naivete would have meant money they looked at eachother with rapture and basil answered warmly while the waiter flushedas at a personal compliment yes it

to do with rochester</s> now my dear you dont mean to say you didnt know that the geneseefalls were at rochester</s>  upon my word im ashamed</s>  why were withinten minutes walk of them now</s> then walk to them at once</s>  cried isabel wholly unabashed and in factunable to see what he had to be ashamed of</s>  actually i believe youwould have allowed me to leave rochester without telling me the fallswere here if you hadnt happened to think of sam patch</s> saying this she persuaded herself that a chief object of their journeyhad been to visit the scene of sam patchs fatal exploit and she drewbasil with a nervous swiftness in the direction of the railroad stationbeyond which he said were the falls</s>  presently after threading theirway among a multitude of locomotives with and without trains attachedthat backed and advanced or stood still hissing impatiently on everyside they passed through the station to a broad planking abovethe river on the other side and thence after encounter of morelocomotives they found by dint of much asking a street winding upthe hillside to the left and leading to the german bierhaus that givesaccess to the best view of the cataract</s> the americans have characteristically bordered the river withmanufactures making every drop work its passage to the brink while thegermans have as characteristically made use of the beauty left over andhave built a bierhaus where they may regale both soul and sense in thepresence of the cataract</s>  our travellers might in another mood andplace have thought it droll to arrive at that sublime spectacle througha bierhaus but in this enchanted city it seemed to have a peculiarfitness</s> a narrow corridor gave into a wide festival space occupied by manytables each of which was surrounded by a group of clamorous germans ofeither sex and every age with tall beakers of beaded lager beforethem and slim flasks of rhenish overhead flamed the gas in globes ofvaricolored glass the walls were painted like those of such haunts inthe fatherland and the weddingjourneyers were fair to linger ontheir way to dwell upon that scene of honest enjoyment to inhale themingling odors of beer and of pipes and of the pungent cheeses in whichthe children of the fatherland delight</s>  amidst the inspiriting clash ofplates and glasses the rattle of knives and forks and the hoarse rushof gutturals they could catch the words franzosen kaiser konig andschlacht and they knew that festive company to be exulting in the firstgerman triumphs of the war which were then the days news they sawfists shaken at noses in fierce exchange of joy arms tossed abroad inwild congratulation and healthpouring goblets of beer lifted in air</s> then they stepped into the moonlight again and heard only the solemnorgan stops of the cataract</s>  through gardenground they were led by thelittle maid their guide to a small pavilion that stood on the edgeof the precipitous shore and commanded a perfect view of the falls</s>  asthey entered this pavilion a youth and maiden clearly lovers passedout and they were left alone with that sublime presence</s>  something ofdefiniteness was to be desired in the spectacle but there was amplecompensation in the mystery with which the broad effulgence and thedense unluminous shadows of the moonshine invested it</s>  the light touchedall the tops of the rapids that seemed to writhe sway from the brink ofthe cataract and then desperately breaking and perishing to fall thewhite disembodied ghosts of rapids down to the bottom of the vast anddeep ravine through which the river rushed away</s>  now the waters seemedto mass themselves a hundred feet high in a wall of snowy compactnessnow to disperse into their multitudinous particles and hang like somevaporous cloud from the cliff</s>  every moment renewed the vision of beautyin some rare and fantastic shape and its loveliness isolated it inspite of the great town on the other shore the station with its bridgeand its trains the mills that supplied their feeble little needs fromthe cataracts strength</s> at last basil pointed out the tablerock in the middle of the fall fromwhich sam patch had made his fatal leap

tenderestunearthliest lovesongs in the world</s>  at the same time they did notdisdain the matteroffact corporeity in which their sentiment wasenshrined they fed it heartily and abundantly with the banquet whoserelics we see here</s> on a table before them stood a pair of beerglasses in the bottomsof which lurked scarce the foam of the generous liquor lately brimmingthem some shreds of sausage

sam patch as they gazedupon the falls</s>  on the contrary ive no doubt that he recalled to herthe ballad which a poet of their language made about him</s>  it used to gothe rounds of the german

morning the illusion that had wrapt the whole earth was gonewith the moonlight</s>  by nine oclock when the weddingjourneyers resumedtheir way toward niagara the heat had already set in with the

were covered withcinders which also crackled under foot</s>  dust was on everythingespecially the persons of the crumpled and weary passengers ofovernight</s>  those who came aboard at rochester failed to lightenthe spiritual gloom and presently they sank into the common bodilywretchedness</s>  the train was somewhat belated and as it drew nearerbuffalo they knew the conductor to have abandoned himself to thatblackest of the arts making time</s>  the long irregular jolt of theordinary progress was reduced to an incessant shudder and a quicklateral motion</s>  the air within the cars was deadly if a window wasraised a storm of dust and cinders blew in and quick gusts caught awaythe breath</s>  so they sat with closed windows sweltering and stiflingand all the faces on which a lively horror was not painted were dull anddamp with apathetic misery</s> the incidents were in harmony with the abject physical tone of thecompany</s>  there was a quarrel between a thin shrillvoiced highlydressed muchbedizened jewess on the one side and a fat greedy oldwoman half asleep and a boy with large pink transparent ears thatstood out from his head like the handles of a jar on the other sideabout a seat which the hebrew wanted and which the others had keptfilled with packages on the pretense that it was engaged</s>  it was a loudand fierce quarrel enough but it won no sort of favor and when thejewess had given a final opinion that the greedy old woman was nolady and the boy who disputed in an ironical temper replied highlycomplimentary i must say there was no sign of relief or otheracknowledgment in any of the spectators that there had been a quarrel</s> there was a little more interest taken in the misfortune of an oldpurblind german and his son who were found by the conductor to be a fewhundred miles out of the direct course to their destination and werewith some trouble and the aid of an americanized fellowcountryman madeaware of the fact</s>  the old man then

certainly</s>  i didnt propose coming this way</s> i know it dear</s>  i was only asking said isabel meekly</s>  but i shouldthink youd have generosity enough to take a little of the blame when iwanted to come out of a romantic feeling for you</s> this romantic feeling referred to the fact that many years before whenbasil made his first visit to niagara he had approached from the westby way of buffalo and isabel who tenderly begrudged his having existedbefore she knew him and longed to ally herself retrospectively with hispast was resolved to draw near the great cataract by no other route</s> she fetched a little sigh which might mean the weather or hishardheartedness</s>  the sigh touched him and he suggested a carriageridethrough the city she assented with eagerness for it was

another thing till i get to niagara</s>  nothingless sublime is worthy the eyes that have beheld such beauty</s> however on the way to niagara she consented to glimpses of the riverwhich carries the waters of the lake for their mighty plunge andwhich shows itself very nobly from time to time as you draw toward thecataract with wooded or cultivated islands and rich farms along itslow shores and at last flashes upon the eye the shining white of therapidsa hint no more of the splendor and awfulness to be revealed</s> vi</s>  niagara</s> as the train stopped isabels heart beat with a childlike exultationas i believe every ones heart must who is worthy to arrive at niagara</s> she had been trying to fancy from time to time that she heard the roarof the cataract and now when she alighted from the car she was sureshe should have heard it but for the vulgar little noises that attendthe arrival of trains at niagara as well as everywhere else</s>  nevermind dearest you shall be stunned with it before you leave promisedher husband and not wholly disconsolate she rode through thequaint streets of the village where it remains a question whether thelowliness of the shops and private houses makes the hotels look so vastor the bigness of the hotels dwarfs all the other buildings</s>  the immensecaravansaries swelling up from among the little bazaars where theysell feather fans and miniature bark canoes and jars and vases andbracelets and brooches carved out of the local rocks made ourfriends with their trunks very conscious of their disproportion to theaccommodations of the smallest</s>  they were the sole occupants of theomnibus and they were embarrassed to be received at their hotel witha burst of minstrelsy from a whole band of music</s>  isabel felt that asingle stringed instrument of some timid note would have been enoughand basil was going to express his own modest preference for ajewsharp when the music ceased with a sudden clash of the cymbals</s> but the next moment it burst out with fresh sweetness and in alightingthey perceived that another omnibus had turned the corner and wasdrawing up to the pillared portico of the hotel</s>  a small familydismounted and the feet of the last had hardly touched the pavementwhen the music again ended as abruptly as those flourishes of trumpetsthat usher playerkings upon the stage</s>  isabel could not help laughingat this melodious parsimony</s>  i hope they dont let on the cataract andshut it off in this frugal style do they basil</s>  she asked and passedjesting through a pomp of unoccupied porters and tallboys</s>  apparentlythere were not many people stopping at this hotel or else they wereall out looking at the falls or confined to their rooms</s>  however ourtravellers took in the almost weird emptiness of the place with theirusual gratitude to fortune for all queerness in life and followed tothe pleasant quarters assigned them</s>  there was time before supper for aglance at the cataract and after a brief toilet they sallied out againupon the holiday street with its parade of gay little shops and thencepassed into the grove beside the falls enjoying at every instant theirfeeling of arrival at a sublime destination</s> in this sense niagara deserves almost to rank with rome the metropolisof history and religion with venice the chief city of sentiment andfantasy</s>  in either you are at once made at home by a perception of itsgreatness in which there is no quality of aggression as there alwaysseems to be in minor places as well as in minor men and you gratefullyaccept its sublimity as a fact in no way contrasting with your owninsignificance</s> our friends were beset of course by many carriagedrivers whom theyrepelled with the kindly firmness of experienced travel</s>  isabel evenfelt a compassion for these poor fellows who had seen niagara so much asto have forgotten that the first time one must see it alone or only withthe next of friendship</s>  she was voluble in her pity of basil that itwas not as new to him as to her till between the trees they saw a whitecloud of spray shot through and through with sunset rising risingand she felt her voice softly and steadily beaten down by the diapasonof the cataract</s> i am not sure but the first emotion on viewing niagara is that offamiliarity</s>  ever after its strangeness increases but in that earliestmoment when you stand by the side of the american fall and take in somuch of the whole as your giants can compass an impression of havingseen it often before is certainly very vivid</s>  this may be an effect ofthat grandeur which puts you at your ease in its presence but italso undoubtedly results in part from lifelong acquaintance with everyvariety of futile picture of the scene</s>  you have its outward formclearly in your memory the shores the rapids the islands the curveof the falls and the stout rainbow with one end resting on their topand the other lost in the mists that rise from the gulf beneath</s>  onthe whole i do not account this sort of familiarity a misfortune</s>  thesurprise is none the less a surprise because it is kept till the lastand the marvel making itself finally felt in every nerve and not atonce through a single sense all the more fully possesses you</s>  it is asif niagara reserved her magnificence and preferred to win your heartwith her beauty and so isabel who was instinctively prepared for thereverse suffered a vague disappointment for a little instant as shelooked along the verge from the water that caressed the shore at herfeet before it flung itself down to the wooded point that divides theamerican from the canadian fall beyond which showed dimly throughits veil of golden and silver mists the emerald wall

sauntering about in everydirection among the trees</s>  in fact that prodigious presence does makea solitude and silence round every spirit worthy to perceive it andit gives a kind of dignity to all its belongings so that the rocks andpebbles in the waters edge and the weeds and grasses that nod aboveit have a value far beyond that of such common things elsewhere</s>  in allthe aspects of niagara there seems a grave simplicity which is perhapsa reflection of the spectators soul for once utterly dismantled ofaffectation and convention</s>  in the vulgar reaction from this you are ofcourse as trivial if you like at niagara as anywhere</s> slowly isabel became aware that the sacred grove beside the fall wasprofaned by some very common presences indeed that tossed bits of stoneand sticks into the consecrated waters and struggled for handkerchiefsand fans and here and there put their arms about each others waistsand made a show of laughing and joking</s>  they were a picnic party ofrude silly folks of the neighborhood and she stood pondering them insad wonder if anything could be worse when she heard a voice saying tobasil take you next sir</s>  plenty of light yet and the

fall of mist</s>  but in another breath she forgot them as she lookedon that dizzied sea hurling itself from the high summit in huge whiteknots and breaks and masses and plunging into the gulf beside

truthful note of quality and now beheld thetumbling deluge as a gothic wall of careen marble white motionlessand now as a fall of lightest snow with movement in all its atomsand scarce so much cohesion as would hold them together and againthey could not discern if this course were from above or from beneathwhether the water rose from the abyss or dropped from the height</s>  theear could give the brain no assurance of the sound that felled itand whether it were great or little the prevailing softness of thecataracts tone seemed so much opposed to ideas of prodigious force orof prodigious volume</s>  it was only when the sight so idle in its ownbehalf came to the aid of the other sense and showed them the mutemovement of each others lips that they dimly appreciated the depth ofsound that involved them</s> i think you might have been highstrung there for a second or twosaid basil when ascending the incline he could make himself heard</s> we will try the bridge next</s> over the river so still with its oily eddies and delicate wreaths offoam just below the falls they have in late years woven a web of wirehigh in air and hung a bridge from precipice to precipice</s>  of all thebridges made with hands it seems the lightest most ethereal it isideally graceful and droops from its slight towers like a garland</s>  itis worthy to command as it does the whole grandeur of niagara andto show the traveller the vast spectacle from the beginning of theamerican fall to the farthest limit of the horseshoe with all theawful pomp of the rapids the solemn darkness of the

great for unalloyeddelight and yet the thrill was a glorious one to be known only thereand afterwards at least they would not have had their airy path seemmore secure</s> the last hues of sunset

back from the shore to the spot where they hadstood they felt relieved that unreality should possess itself of alland that the bridge should swing there in midair like a filmy webscarce more passable

gentlemantook this in good part and owned it might seem so but added that adistinguished phrenologist had examined his head and told him he hadequilibrium so large that he could go anywhere</s> on

with the most</s> im going to have had quite a flirtation with the gentleman of the longblond mustache whom we met on the bridge this morning and hes got todo duty in accounting for my missing glove</s>  itll never do to tell thegirls i dropped it from the top of terrapin tower</s>  then you know fannyi really can say something about dining with aristocratic southernerswaited upon by their black servants</s> this referred to the sadfaced patrician whom basil and isabel had notedin the cars from buffalo as a southerner probably coming north for thefirst time since the war</s>  he had an air at once fierce and sad and ahalfbarbaric homicidal gentility of manner fascinating enough in itsway</s>  he sat with his wife at a table farther down the room and theirchild was served in part by a little tancolored nursemaid</s>  the factdid not quite answer to the young ladys description of it and getit certainly afforded her a groundwork</s>  basil fancied a sort ofbewilderment in the southerner and explained it upon the theory that heused to come every year to niagara before the war and was now puzzledto find it so changed</s> yes he said i cant account for him except as the ghost of southerntravel and i cant help feeling a little sorry for him</s>  i suppose thatalmost any evil commends itself by its ruin the wrecks of slavery arefast growing a fungus crop of sentiment and

did not earn like princes they held their heads highthey trampled upon the abolitionist in his lair they received thehomage of the doughface in his home</s>  they came up here from theirriceswamps and cottonfields and bullied the whole busy civilizationof the north</s>  everybody who had merchandise or principles to selltruckled to them and travel amongst us was a triumphal progress</s>  nowtheyre

our southern friend misses it</s>  they gave us a very smallallowance of brass band when we arrived isabel</s>  upon my word i wonderwhats come over the place he said as the southern party rising fromthe table walked out of the diningroom attended by many treacherousechoes in spite of an ostentatious clatter of dishes that the waitersmade</s> after dinner they drove on the canada shore up past the clifton housetowards the burning spring which is not the least wonder of niagara</s> as each bubble breaks upon the troubled surface and yields its flashof infernal flame and its whiff of

keep intact the reminiscence ofhis former visit</s>  they have a sort of tower of observation built on thebattleground he said as they drove on down by the river and it wasin charge of an old canadian militiaman who had helped his countrymento be beaten in the fight</s>  this hero gave me a simple and unintelligibleaccount of the battle asking me first if i had ever heard of generalscott and adding without flinching that here he got his earliestlaurels</s>  he seemed to go just so long to every listener and nothingcould stop him short so i fell into a revery until he came to an end</s> it was hard to remember that sweet summer morning when the sun shoneand the birds sang and the music of a piano and a girls voice rosefrom a bowery cottage near that all the pure air had once been

battle of the pastseemed only a vagary of mine yet how could i doubt the warrior at myelbow</s> grieved though i was to find that a habit of strong drinkhad the better of his utterance that morning</s>  my driver explainedafterwards that persons visiting the field were commonly so muchpleased with the captains eloquence that they kept the noble oldsoldier in a brandy andwater rapture

off as they came in sight of aslender stream of water that escaped from the brow of a cliff on theamerican side below the falls and spun itself into a gauze of silverymist thats the bridal veil and i suppose you think the stream whichis making such a fine display yonder is some idle brooklet ending along course of error and worthlessness by that spectacular plunge</s> its nothing of the kind its an honest hydraulic canal of the moststraightforward character a poor but respectable millrace which hasdevoted itself strictly to business and has turned millwheels insteadof fooling round waterlilies</s>  it can afford that ultimate finery</s>  whatyou behold in the bridal veil my love is the apotheosis of industry</s> what i cant help thinking of said isabel who had not paid thesmallest attention to the bridal veil or anything about it is theawfulness of stepping off these places in the nighttime</s>  she referredto the road which next the precipice is unguarded by any

peculiar merits to basil and in spite ofall reason making him feel for the moment that he was privileged by adocument which was no doubt part of every such transaction</s>  he spoke ina loud cheerful voice he laughed jollily at no apparent joke he bowedvery low and said goodevening</s>  at parting and they went away as ifhe had blessed them</s> the rest of the evening they spent in wandering through the villagecharmed with its bizarre mixture of quaintness and commonplaceness inhanging about the shopwindows with their monotonous variety of featherfanseach with a violently red or yellow

demanded his wife the cook</s>  but seeing his ghastlylook at this she fell upon his neck crying o you poor old tastelessdarling</s>  youve got it for me</s>  and seemed about to die of laughter</s>

basil dearest</s>  you areincorrigible</s>  cant you learn that magenta is the vilest of all the huesthat the perverseness of man has invented in defiance of nature</s>  now mylove just promise me one

the fan into her trunk and he murmured somethingabout exchanging it</s>  no she said well keep it as aamonument</s> and she deposed him with another peal of laughter from the proudheight to which he had climbed in pity of her nervous fears of the day</s> so completely were their places changed that he doubted if it were nothe who had made that scene on the third sister and when isabel saido why wont men use their reasoning faculties</s>  he could not forhimself have claimed any and he could not urge the truth that he hadbought the fan more for its barbaric brightness than for its beauty</s> she would not let him get angry and he could say nothing against thehalfironical petting with which she soothed his mortification</s> but all troubles passed with the night and the next morning theyspent a charming hour about prospect point and in sauntering over goatisland somewhat daintily tasting the flavors of the place on whosewonders they had so hungrily and indiscriminately feasted at

descend the inclinedrailway to the foot of the american fall they smiled at the idea ofgoing up terrapin tower they derided the vulgar daring of those whowent out upon the three weird sisters for some whom they saw about togo down the biddle stairs to the cave of the winds they had no words toexpress their contempt</s> then they made their excursion to the whirlpool mistakenly going downon the american side for it is much better seen from the other thoughseen from any point it is the most impressive feature of the wholeprodigious spectacle of niagara</s> here within the compass of a mile

bodies ofdrowned men carried into the whirlpool and made to enact upon its dizzysurges a travesty of life apparently floating there at their pleasurediving and frolicking amid the waves or frantically struggling toescape from the death that has long since befallen them</s> on the american side not far below the railway suspension bridge is anelevator more than a hundred and eighty feet high which is meant tolet people down to the shore below and to give a view of the rapidson their own level</s>  from the cliff opposite it looks a terribly frailstructure of pine sticks but is doubtless stronger than it looks andat any rate as it has never yet fallen to pieces it may be pronouncedperfectly safe</s> in the waitingroom at the top basil and isabel found mr</s>  richard andhis ladies again who got into the movable chamber with them and theyall silently descended together</s>  it was not a time for talk of any kindeither when they were slowly and not quite smoothly dropping through thelugubrious upper part of the structure where it was darkened by a roughweatherboarding or lower down where the unobstructed light showed thegrim tearful face of the cliff bedrabbled with oozy springs and theaudacious slightness of the elevator</s> an abiding distrust of the machinery overhead mingled in isabels heartwith a doubt of the value of the scene below and she could not lookforward to escape from her present perils by the conveyance which hadbrought her into them with any satisfaction</s>  she wanly smiled andshrank closer to basil while the other matron made nothing of seizingher husband violently by the arm and imploring him to stop it wheneverthey experienced a rougher jolt than usual</s> at the bottom of the cliff they were helped out of their prison by ahumid young englishman with much clay on him whose face was red andbathed in perspiration for it was very hot down there in his littleinclosure of baking pine boards and it was not much cooler out on

was a magnificentsight and for a moment none of them were sorry to have come</s>  the surgesdid not look like the gigantic ripples on a rivers course as they werebut like a procession of ocean billows

stone rose naked from these beardedhere and there with cedar and everywhere frowning with shaggy brows ofevergreen</s>  the place is inexpressibly lonely and dreadful and one feelslike an alien

thing that merits ruin yet it is better than something moreelaborate for it looks temporary and since there must be an elevatorit is well to have it of the most transitory aspect</s>  some such qualityof rude impermanence consoles you for the presence of most improvementsby which you enjoy niagara the suspension bridges for their part beingsaved from offensiveness by their beauty and unreality</s> ascending none of the party spoke isabel and the other matron blanchedin each others faces their husbands maintained a stolid resignation</s> when they stepped out of their trap into the

we come to niagara in the patronizingspirit in which we approach everything nowadays and for a few hours wehave it our own way and pay our little tributes of admiration withas much complacency as we feel in acknowledging the existence of thesupreme being</s>  but after a while we are aware of some potent influenceundermining our selfsatisfaction we begin to conjecture that the greatcataract does not exist by virtue of our approval and to feel thatit will not cease when we go away</s>  the second day makes us its abjectslaves and on the third we want to fly from it in terror</s>  i believesome

about it</s>  and the rush and the whirl and the dampnessin ones face and the everlasting chirrrrr of everything</s> she dipped suddenly upon his shoulder for a moments oblivion and thenrose radiant

would iwere a poet for a quarter of an hour</s> isabel departed in almost a forgiving mood towards the weak sisterhoodof evident brides and both our friends felt a lurking fondness forniagara at the last moment</s>  i do not know how much of their contentwas due to the fact that they had suffered no sort of wrong there fromthose who are apt to prey upon travellers</s>  in the hotel a placard warnedthem to have nothing to do with the miscreant hackmen on the streetsbut always to order their carriage at the office on the street thehackmen whispered to them not to trust the exorbitant drivers in leaguewith the landlords yet their actual experience was great reasonablenessand facile contentment with the sum agreed upon</s> this may have been because the hackmen so far outnumbered the visitorsthat the latter could dictate terms but they chose to believe it atriumph of civilization and i will never be the cynic to sneer at theirfaith</s>  only at the station was the virtue of

down from niagara by rail</s>  atthe broad lowbanked rivermouth the steamer lay beside the railroadstation and while isabel disposed of herself on board basil looked tothe transfer of the baggage novelly comforted in the business by therespectfulness of the young canadian who took charge of the trunks forthe boat</s>  he was slow and his system was not goodhe did notgive checks for the pieces but marked them with the name of theirdestination and there was that indefinable something in his mannerwhich hinted his hope that you would remember the porter but he wasso civil that he did not snub the meekest and most vexatious of thepassengers and basil mutely blessed his servile soul</s>  few whiteamericans he said to himself would behave so decently in his placeand he could not conceive of the american steamboat clerk who would usethe politeness towards a waiting crowd that the canadian purser showedwhen they all wedged themselves in about his window to receive theirstateroom keys</s>  he was somewhat awkward like the porter but he waspatient and he did not lose his temper even when some of the crowdfinding he would not bully them made bold to bully him</s>  he was threetimes as

passengers hersemiacquaintances of the hotel parlor and the rapidselevator and hadglanced tentatively towards them</s>  whereupon the matron of the partyhad made advances that ended in their all

the points of likeness between isabel and mrs</s>  ellison shortly made themmutually uninteresting and leaving her husband to the others isabelfrankly sought the companionship of miss kitty in whom

well as their household cares hadkept them from taking many long journeys</s>  they passed their winters inboston and their summers on the south shore cheaper than the northshore and near enough for basil to go up and down every day forbusiness but they promised themselves that some day they would revisitcertain points on their wedding journey and perhaps somewhere findtheir lost secondyouth on

niagara</s> it had been very hot for several days but that morning the east windcame in and crisped the air till it seemed to rustle like tinsel andthe sky was as sincerely and solidly blue as if it had been chromoed</s> they felt that they were really looking up into the roof of the worldwhen they glanced at it but when an old gentleman hastily kissed ayoung woman and commended her to the conductor as being one who wasgoing all the way to san francisco alone and then risked his life bystepping off the moving train the vastness of the great american factbegan to affect isabel disagreeably</s>  is nt it too big basil</s>  shepleaded peering timidly out of the little municipal consciousness inwhich she had been so long housed</s> in that seclusion she had sufferedcertain original tendencies to increase upon her her nerves were moresensitive and electrical her apprehensions had multiplied quite beyondthe ratio of the dangers that beset her and basil had counted upon

advanced devouringlyupon her</s>  but they had the best section in the very centre of thesleepingcarshe drew what consolation she could from the factandthe childrens premature demand for lunch helped

he went on as some men do whilesomerville vanished and even tufts college which assails the bostonianvision from every point of the compass was shut out by the curve at thefoot of the belmont

basil and isabel that their fellowpassengers wereso interesting as their fellow passengers used to be in their formerdays of travel</s>  they were soberly dressed and were all of a middleagedsobriety of deportment from which nothing salient offered itself forconjecture or speculation and there was little within the car to taketheir minds from the brilliant young world that flashed and sang by themoutside</s>  the belated spring had ripened with its frequent rains intothe perfection of early summer the grass was thicker and the foliagedenser than they had ever seen it before and when they had run outinto the hills beyond fitchburg they saw the laurel in bloom</s>  it waseverywhere in the woods lurking like drifts among the underbrush andoverflowing the tops and stealing down the hollows of the railroadembankments a snow of blossom flushed with a mist of pink</s>  its shywild beauty ceased whenever the train stopped but the orioles madeup for its absence with their singing in the village trees about thestations and though fitchburg and ayers junction and athol are notnames that invoke historical or romantic associations the hearts ofbasil and isabel began to stir with the joy of travel before they hadpassed these points</s>  at the first basil got out to buy the cold chickenwhich had been commanded and he recognized in the keeper of therailroad restaurant their former conductor who had been warned by thespirits never to travel without a flower of some sort carried betweenhis lips and who had preserved his own life and the lives of hispassengers for many years by this simple device</s>  his presence lent thesponge cake and rhubarb pie and baked beans a supernatural interestand reconciled basil to the toughness of the athletic bird which themystical expartner

willingness to find poetry in things around them that kept hislife and isabels fresh and they taught their children the secret oftheir elixir</s>  to be sure it was only a genre poetry but it was suchas has always inspired english art and song and now the whole familyenjoyed as if it had been a passage from goldsmith or wordsworth theflying sentiment of the railroad side</s>  there was a simple interior atone placea small shanty showing through the open door a cook stovesurmounted by the evening coffeepot with a lazy cat outstretched uponthe floor in the middle distance and an old woman standing just outsidethe threshold to see the train go bywhich had an unrivaled value tillthey came to a superannuated car on a siding in the woods in which therailroad workmen boardedsome were lounging on the platform and at theopen windows while others were washing up for supper and the wholescene was full of holiday ease and sylvan comradery that went to thehearts of the sympathetic spectators</s>  basil had lately been readingaloud the delightful history of rudder grange and the children who hadmade their secret vows never to live in anything but an old canalboatwhen they grew

shadow</s>  there werepeople rowing on the water and every pretty town had some touch ofpicturesqueness or pastoral charm to offer at greenfield there werechildren playing in the newmown hay along the railroad embankment atshelburne falls there was a game of cricket going on among the englishoperatives of the cutlery works as basil boldly asserted</s>  they lookeddown from their carwindow on a young lady swinging in a hammock in herdooryard and on an old gentleman hoeing his potatoes a group of girlswaved their handkerchiefs to the passing train and a boy paused inweeding a gardenbedand probably denied that he had paused later</s> in the mean time the golden haze along the mountain side changed toa clear pearly lustre and the quiet evening possessed the quietlandscape</s>  they confessed to each other that it was all as sweet andbeautiful as it used to be and in fact they had seen palaces in otherdays which did not give them the pleasure they found in a woodcuttersshanty losing itself among the shadows in a solitude of the hills</s>  thetunnel after this was a gross and material sensation but they joinedthe children in trying to hold and keep it and basil let the boy timeit by his watch</s>  now said tom when five minutes were gone we areunder the very centre of the mountain</s>  but the tunnel was like allaccomplished facts all hopes fulfilled valueless to the soul andscarcely appreciable to the sense and the children emerged at northadams with but a mean opinion of that great feat of engineering</s>  basildrew a pretty moral from their experience</s>  if you rode upon a comet youwould be disappointed</s>  take my advice and never ride upon a comet</s> i shouldnt object to your riding on a little meteoryou would ntexpect much of that but i warn you

 but they woke refreshed and encouraged from slumbersthat had evidently been unbroken though they both protested that theyhad not slept a wink the whole night and gave themselves up to wonderat the interminable levels of western new york over which the train wasrunning</s>  the longing to come to an edge somewhere that the new englandtraveler experiences on this plain was inarticulate with the childrenbut it breathed in the sigh with which isabel welcomed even thearchitectural inequalities of a city into which they drew in the earlymorning</s>  this city showed to their weary eyes a noble stretch of riverfrom the waters of which lofty piles of buildings rose abruptly andisabel being left to guess where they were could think of no otherplace so picturesque as rochester</s> yes said her husband it is our own enchanted city</s>  i wonder if thatunstinted hospitality is still dispensed by the good head waiter at thehotel where we stopped to bridal parties who have passed the ordeal ofthe haughty hotel clerk</s>  i wonder what has become of that hotel clerk</s> has he fallen through pride to some lower level or has he bowed hisarrogant spirit to the demands of advancing civilization and realizedthat he is the servant and not the master of the public</s>  i think ivenoticed since his time a growing kindness in hotel clerks or perhapsi have become of a more impressive

forefinger that he touches that little snapbell with when hedoesnt look at you must be very pudgy now</s>  come let us get out andbreakfast at rochester they will give us broiled whitefish and we canshow the children where sam patch jumped over genesee falls andno no basil cried his wife</s>  it would be sacrilege</s>  all that issacred to those dear young days of ours and i wouldnt think of tryingto repeat it</s>  our own ghosts would rise up in that diningroom toreproach us for our intrusion</s>  oh perhaps we have done a wicked thingin coming this journey</s>  we ought to have left the past alone we shallonly mar our memories of all these beautiful places</s>  do you supposebuffalo can be as poetical as it was then</s>  buffalo</s>  the name does ntinvite the muse very much</s>  perhaps it never was very poetical</s>  ohbasil dear im afraid we have only come to find out that we weremistaken about everything</s>  lets leave rochester alone at any rate</s> im not troubled</s>  we wont disturb our dream of rochester but i dontdespair of buffalo</s>  im sure that buffalo will be all that our fancyever painted it</s>  i believe in buffalo</s> well well murmured isabel i hope youre right and she put somethings together for leaving their car at buffalo while they were stilltwo hours away</s> when they reached a place where the land mated its level with the levelof the lake they ran into a wilderness of railroad cars in a worldwhere life seemed to be operated solely by locomotives and theirhelpless minions</s>  the bellowing and bleating trains were arriving inevery direction not only along the ground floor of the plain butstately stretches of trestlework which curved and extended across theplain carried them to and fro overhead</s>  the travelers owned that thisrailroad suburb had its own impressiveness and they said that thetrestlework was as noble in effect as the lines of aqueduct that stalkacross the roman campagna</s>  perhaps this was because they had not seenthe campagna or its aqueducts for a great while but they were so gladto find themselves in the spirit of their former journey again that theywere amiable to everything</s>  when the children first caught sight of thelakes delicious blue and cried out that it was lovelier than the seathey felt quite a local pride in their preference</s>  it was what isabelhad said twelve years before on first beholding the lake</s> but they did not really see the lake till they had taken the train forniagara falls after breakfasting in the depot where the children usedto the severe native or the patronizing irish ministrations of bostonrestaurants and hotels reveled for the first time in the affectionatedevotion of a black waiter</s>  there was already a ridiculous abundanceand variety on the table but this waiter brought them strawberriesand again strawberries and repeated plates of griddle cakes with maplesyrup and he hung over the back of first one chair and then anotherwith an unselfish joy in the appetites of the breakfasters which gavebasil renewed hopes of his race</s>  such rapture in serving argues alargeness of nature which will be recognized hereafter he saidfeeling about in his waistcoat pocket for a quarter</s>  it seemed a pityto render the waiters zeal retroactively interested but in view of thefact that he possibly expected the quarter there was nothing else todo and by a mysterious stroke of gratitude the waiter delivered theminto the hands of a friend who took another quarter from them forcarrying their bags and wraps to the train</s>  this second retainerapproved their admiration of the aesthetic forms and colors of the depotcolonnade and being asked if that were the depot whose roof had fallenin some years before proudly replied that it was</s> there were a great many killed were nt there</s>  asked basil withsympathetic satisfaction in the disaster</s>  the porter seemed humiliatedhe confessed the mortifying truth that the loss of life was small buthe recovered a just selfrespect in adding if the roof had fallen infive minutes sooner it would have killed about three hundred people</s> basil had promised the children a sight of the rapids before theyreached the falls and they held him rigidly accountable from the momentthey entered the train and began to run out of the city between theriver and the canal</s>  he attempted a diversion with the canal boats andtried to bring forward the subject of rudder grange in that connection</s> they said that the canal boats were splendid but they were looking forthe rapids now and they declined to be interested in a window in oneof the boats which basil said was just like the window that the ruddergranger and the boarder had popped pomona out of when they took her fora burglar</s> you spoil those children basil said his wife as they clambered overhim and clamored for the rapids</s> at present im giving them an objectlesson in patience andselfdenial they are experiencing the fact that they cant have therapids till they get to them and probably theyll be disappointed inthem when they arrive</s> in fact they valued the rapids very little more than the hoosac tunnelwhen they came in sight of them at last and basil had some question inhis own mind whether the rapids had not dwindled since his former visit</s> he did not breathe this doubt to isabel however and she arrived at thefalls with unabated expectations</s>  they were going to spend only half aday there and they turned into the station away from the phalanxof omnibuses when they dismounted from their train</s>  they seemed asbefore to be the only passengers who had arrived and they found anabundant choice of carriages waiting in the street outside the station</s> the niagara hackman may once have been a predatory and very rampantanimal but public opinion long expressed through the public printshas reduced him to silence and meekness</s>  apparently he may not so muchas beckon with his whip to the arriving wayfarer it is certain that hecannot cross the pavement to the station door and basil inviting oneof them to negotiation was himself required by the attendant policemanto step out to the curbstone and complete his transaction there</s>  it wasan impressive illustration of the power of a free press but upon thewhole basil found the effect melancholy it had the saddening qualitywhich inheres in every sort of perfection</s>  the hackman reduced toentire order appealed to his compassion and he had not the heart tobeat him down from his moderate first demand as perhaps he ought tohave done</s>  they drove directly to the cataract and found themselves inthe pretty grove beside the american fall and in the air whose dampnesswas as familiar as if they had breathed it all their childhood</s>  it wasfull now of the fragrance of some sort of wild blossom and again theyhad that old entrancing sense of the mingled awfulness and lovelinessof the great spectacle</s>  this sylvan perfume the gayety of the sunshinethe mildness of the breeze that stirred the leaves overhead and thebirdsinging that made itself heard amid the roar of the rapids and thesolemn incessant plunge of the cataract moved their hearts and madethem children with the boy and girl who stood rapt for a moment andthen broke into joyful wonder</s>  they could sympathize with the ardor withwhich tom longed to tempt fate at the brink of the river and overthe tops of the parapets which have been built along the edge of theprecipice and they equally entered into the terror with which bellascreamed at his suicidal zeal</s>  they joined her in restraining him theyreduced him to a beggarly account of half a dozen stones flung into therapids at not less than ten paces from the brink and they would notlet him toss the smallest pebble over the parapet though he laughed toscorn the notion that anybody should be hurt by them below</s> it seemed to them that the triviality of man in the surroundings of thefalls had increased with the lapse of time</s>  there were more booths andbazaars and more colored feather fans with whole birds spitted in thecentres and there was an offensive array of blue and green and yellowglasses on the shore through which you were expected to look at thefalls gratis</s>  they missed the simple dignity of the blanching indianmaids who used to squat about on the grass with their laps full ofmoccasins and pincushions</s>  but as of old the photographer came outof his saloon and invited them to pose for a family group representingthat the light and the spray were singularly propitious and thateverything in nature invited them to be taken</s>  basil put him off gentlyfor the sake of the time when he had refused to be photographed in abridal group and took refuge from him in the long low building fromwhich you descend to the foot of the cataract</s> the grove beside the american fall has been inclosed and named prospectpark by a company which exacts half a dollar for admittance and thenmakes you free of all its wonders and conveniences for which you oncehad to pay severally</s>  this is well enough but formerly you could refuseto go down the inclined tramway and now you cannot without feelingthat you have failed to get your moneys worth</s>  it was in this illogicalspirit of economy that basil invited his family to the descent butisabel shook her head</s>  no you go with the children she said andi will stay here till you get back her agonized countenance addedand pray for you and basil took his children on either side of himand rumbled down the terrible descent with much of the excitement thatattends travel in an open horsecar</s>  when he stepped out of the carhe felt that increase of courage which comes to every man aftersafely passing through danger</s>  he resolved to brave the mists andslipperystones at the foot of the fall and he would have plunged atonce into this fresh peril if he had not been prevented by the prospectpark company</s>  this ingenious association has built a large tunnellikeshed quite to the waters edge so that you cannot view the cataractas you once could at a reasonable remoteness but must emerge from thebuilding into a storm of spray</s>  the roof of the tunnel is painted witha lively effect in partycolored stripes and is lettered the shadowof the rock so that you take it at first to be an appeal to youraesthetic sense but the real object of the company is not apparent tillyou put your head out into the tempest when you agree with the nearestguideand one is always very nearthat you had better have an oilskindress as basil did</s>  he told the guide that he did not wish to go underthe fall and the guide confidentially admitted that there was no fun inthat any way and in the mean time he equipped him and his children fortheir foray into the mist</s>  when they issued forth under their friendsleadership basil felt that with his children clinging to each hand helooked like some sort of animal with its young and though not unsocialby nature he was glad to be among strangers for the time</s>  they climbedhither and thither over the rocks and lifted their streaming faces forthe views which the guide pointed out and in a rift of the spray theyreally caught one glorious glimpse of the whole sweep of the fall</s>  thenext instant the spray swirled back and they were glad to turn fora sight of the rainbow lying in a circle on the rocks as quietly andnaturally as if that had been the habit of rainbows ever since theflood</s>  this was all there was to be done and they streamed back intothe tunnel where they disrobed in the face of a menacing placard whichannounced that the hire of a guide and a dress for going under the fallwas one dollar</s> will they make you pay a dollar for each of us papa</s>  asked tomfearfully</s> oh pooh no</s>  returned basil we have nt been under the fall</s>  buthe sought out the proprietor with a trembling heart</s>  the proprietor wasa man of severely logical mind he said that the charge would be threedollars for they had had the use of the dresses and the guide just thesame as if they had gone under the fall and he refused to recognizeanything misleading in the dressingroom placard in fine he left basilwithout a leg to stand upon</s>  it was not so much the three dollars as thesense of having been swindled that vexed him and he instantly resolvednot to share his annoyance with isabel</s>  why indeed should he putthat burden upon her</s>  if she were none the wiser she would be none thepoorer and he ought to be willing to deny himself her sympathy for thesake of sparing her needless pain</s> he met her at the top of the inclined tramway with a face of exemplaryunconsciousness and he listened with her to the tale their coachmantold as they sat in a pretty arbor looking out on the rapids of afrenchman and his wife</s>  this frenchman had returned one morning from astroll on goat island and reported with much apparent concern that hiswife had fallen into the water and been carried over the fall</s>  itwas so natural for a man to grieve for the loss of his wife under thepeculiar circumstances that every one condoled with the widower butwhen a few days later her body was found and the distracted husbandrefused to come back from new york to her funeral there was a generalregret that he had not been arrested</s>  a flash of conviction illumed thewhole fact to basils guilty consciousness this unhappy frenchman hadpaid a dollar for the use of an oilskin suit at the foot of the falland had been ashamed to confess the swindle to his wife till in amoment of remorse and madness he shouted the fact into her ear andthen basil looked at the mother of his children and registered a vowthat if he got away from niagara without being forced to a similarexcess he would confess his guilt to isabel at the very first act ofspendthrift profusion she committed</s>  the guide pointed out the rock inthe rapids to which avery had clung for twentyfour hours before he wascarried over the falls and to the morbid fancy of the deceitful husbandisabels bonnet ribbons seemed to flutter from the pointed reef</s>  hecould endure the pretty arbor no longer</s>  come children</s>  he criedwith a wild unnatural gayety let us go to goat island and see thebridge to the three sisters that your mother was afraid to walk back onafter she had crossed it</s> for shame basil</s>  retorted isabel</s>  you know it was you who wereafraid of that bridge</s> the children who knew the story by heart laughed with their father atthe monstrous pretension and his simulated hilarity only increased uponpaying a toll of two dollars at the goat island bridge</s> what extortion</s>  cried isabel with an indignation that secretlyunnerved him</s>  he trembled upon the verge of confession but he hadfinally the moral force to resist</s>  he suffered her to compute the costof their stay at niagara without allowing those three dollars toenter into her calculation he even began to think what justificativeextravagance he could tempt her to</s>  he suggested the purchase oflocal bricabrac he asked her if she would not like to dine at theinternational for old times sake</s>  but she answered with dishearteningvirtue that they must not think of such a thing after what they hadspent already</s>  nothing perhaps marked the confirmed husband in basilmore than these hidden fears and reluctances</s> in the mean time isabel ignorantly abandoned herself to the charm of theplace which she found unimpaired in spite of the reported ravages ofimprovement about niagara</s>  goat island was still the sylvan solitude oftwelve years ago haunted by even fewer nymphs and dryads than of old</s> the air was full of the perfume that scented it at prospect park theleaves showered them with shade and sun as they drove along</s>  if itwere not for the children here she said i should think that ourfirst drive on goat island had never ended</s> she sighed a little and basil leaned forward and took her hand in his</s> it never has ended its the same drive only we are younger now andenjoy it more</s>  it always touched him when isabel was sentimental aboutthe past for the years had tended to make her rather more seriouslymaternal towards him than towards the other children and he recognizedthat these fond reminiscences were the expression of the girlhood stilllurking deep within her heart</s> she shook her head</s>  no but im willing the children should be young inour place</s>  its only fair they should have their turn</s> she remained in the carriage while basil visited the various pointsof view on luna island with the boy and girl</s>  a boy is probably ofconsiderable interest to himself and a man looks back at his ownboyhood with some pathos</s>  but in his actuality a boy has very little tocommend him to the toleration of other human beings</s>  tom was very wellas boys go but now his contribution to the common enjoyment was toventure as near as possible to all perilous edges to throw stones intothe water and to make as if to throw them over precipices on the peoplebelow to pepper his father with questions and to collect cumbrousmementos of the vegetable and mineral kingdoms</s>  he kept the carriagewaiting a good five minutes while he could cut his initials on abandrail</s>  you can come back and see em on your bridal tower saidthe driver</s>  isabel gave a little start as if she had almost thought ofsomething she was trying to think of</s> they occasionally met ladies driving and sometimes they encountereda couple making a tour of the island on foot</s>  but none of these peoplewere young and basil reported that the three sisters were inhabitedonly by persons of like maturity even a group of people who were eatinglunch to the music of the shouting rapids on the outer edge of the lastsister were no younger apparently</s> isabel did not get out of the carriage to verify his report shepreferred to refute his story of her former panic on those islands byremaining serenely seated while he visited them</s>  she thus lost a superbnovelty which nature has lately added to the wonders of this fall inthat place at the edge of the great horse shoe where the rock has fallenand left a peculiarly shaped chasm through this the spray leaps up frombelow and flashes a hundred feet into the air in rocketlike jets andpoints and then breaks and dissolves away in the pyrotechnic curvesof a perpetual fourth of july</s>  basil said something like this incelebrating the display with the purpose of rendering her loss morepoignant but she replied with tranquil piety that she would ratherkeep her niagara unchanged and she declared that as she understoodhim there must be something rather cheap and conscious in the newfeature</s>  she approved however of the change that had removed thatfoolish little terrapin tower from the brink on which it stood and sheconfessed that she could have enjoyed a little variety in the storiesthe driver told them of the indian burialground on the island theywere exactly the stories she and basil had heard twelve years beforeand the illstarred goats from which the island took its name perishedonce more in his narrative</s> under the influence of his romances our travelers began to find thewhole scene hackneyed and they were glad to part from him a littlesooner than they had bargained to do</s>  they strolled about the anomalousvillage on foot and once more marveled at the paucity of travel and theenormity of the local preparation</s>  surely the hotels are nowhere elsein the world so large</s>  could there ever have been visitors enough atniagara to fill them</s>  they were built so big for some good reasonno doubt but it is no more apparent than why all these magnificentequipages are waiting about the empty streets for the people who nevercome to hire them</s> it seems to me that i dont see so many strangers here as i usedbasil had suggested to their driver</s> oh they have nt commenced coming yet he replied with hardycheerfulness and pretended that they were plenty enough in july andaugust</s> they went to dine at the modest restaurant of a colored man whoadvertised a table dhote dinner on a board at his door and they puttheir misgivings to him which seemed to grieve him and he contendedthat niagara was as prosperous and as much resorted to as ever</s>  in factthey observed that their regret for the supposed decline of the falls asa summer resort was nowhere popular in the village and they desisted intheir offers of sympathy after their rebuff from the restaurateur</s> basil got his family away to the station after dinner and left themthere while he walked down the village street for a closer inspectionof the hotels</s>  at the door of the largest a pair of children sported inthe solitude as fearlessly as the birds on selkirks island lookinginto the hotel he saw a few porters and callboys seated in statuesquerepose against the wall while the clerk pined in dreamless inactivitybehind the register some deserted ladies flitted through the door ofthe parlor at the side</s>  he recalled the evening of his former visitwhen he and isabel had met the ellisons in that parlor and it seemedin the retrospect a scene of the wildest gayety</s>  he turned forconsolation into the barbers shop where he found himself the onlycustomer and no busy sound of next greeted his ear</s>  but the barberlike all the rest said that niagara was not unusually empty and hecame out feeling bewildered and defrauded</s>  surely the agent of the boatswhich descend the rapids of the st</s>  lawrence must be frank if basilwent to him and pretended that he was going to buy a ticket</s>  but aglance at the agents sign showed basil that the agent with his bravejollity of manner and his impressive goodmorning had passed awayfrom the deceits of travel and that he was now inherited by his widowwho in turn was absent and temporarily represented by their son</s> the boy in supplying basil with an advertisement of the line madea specious show of haste as if there were a long queue of touristswaiting behind him to be served with tickets</s>  perhaps there was indeeda spectral line there but basil was the only tourist present in theflesh and he shivered in his isolation and fled with the advertisementin his hand</s>  isabel met him at the door of the station with a frightenedface</s> basil she cried i have found out what the trouble is</s>  where are thebrides</s> he took her outstretched hands in his and passing one of them throughhis arm walked with her apart from the children who were examining atthe newsmans booth the moccasins and the birchbark bricabrac of theirish aborigines and the cups and vases of niagara spar imported fromdevonshire</s> my dear he said there are no brides everybody was married twelveyears ago and the brides are middleaged mothers of families now anddont come to niagara if they are wise</s> yes she desolately asserted that is so</s>  something has been hangingover me ever since we came and suddenly i realized that it was theabsence of the brides</s>  butbutdown at the hotelsdidnt you seeanything bridal there</s>  when the omnibuses arrived was there no burst ofminstrelsy</s>  was thereshe could not go on but sank nervelessly into the nearest seat</s> perhaps said basil dreamily regarding the contest of tom and bellafor a newlypurchased paper of sour cherries and helplessly forecastingin his remoter mind the probable consequences there were both bridesand minstrelsy at the hotel if i had only had the eyes to see and theears to hear</s>  in this world my dear we are always of our own timeand we live amid contemporary things</s>  i daresay there were middleagedpeople at niagara when we were here before but we did not meet themnor they us</s>  i daresay that the place is now swarming with bridalcouples and it is because they are invisible and inaudible to usthat it seems such a howling wilderness</s>  but the hotel clerks and therestaurateurs and the hackmen know them and that is the reason whythey receive with surprise and even offense our sympathy for theirloneliness</s>  do you suppose isabel that if you were to lay

keep their gas public property</s>  so they extended theircorporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region roundthere and then the city took possession of every well that was putdown and held it for the common good</s>  anybody thats a mind to come tomoffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wantsfree and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas you wantto heat and light your private house</s>  the people hold on to it forthemselves and as i say its a grand sight to see a whole communityhanging together and working for the good of all instead

go on as long as you like</s> i met him there in the office of a realestate manspeculatorof course everybody was in moffitt but a firstrate fellow andpublicspirited as all getout and when dryfoos left

everybody knew he had the rightstuff in him but he was slower than molasses in january like thosepennsylvania dutch</s>  hed got together the largest and handsomest farmanywhere around there and he was making money on it just like he wasin some business somewhere he was a very intelligent man he took thepapers and kept himself posted but he was awfully oldfashioned in hisideas</s>  he hung on to the doctrines as well as the dollars of the dadsit was a real thing with him</s>  well when the boom began to come he hatedit awfully and he fought it</s>  he used to write communications to theweekly

with him andtry to talk him out of it and tell him how long his fifteen or twentythousand would last him to live on and shake the standard oil companybefore him and try to make him believe it wouldnt be five years beforethe standard owned the whole region</s> of course he couldnt do anything with them</s>  when a mans offered abig price for his farm he dont care whether its by a secret emissaryfrom the standard oil or not hes going to sell and get the better ofthe other fellow if he can</s>  dryfoos couldnt keep the boom out of hasown family even</s>  his wife was with him</s>  she thought whatever he said anddid was just as right as if it had been thundered down from sinai</s>  butthe young folks were sceptical especially the girls that had been awayto school</s>  the boy that had been kept at home because he couldnt bespared from helping his father manage the farm was more like him butthey contrived to stir the boy upwith the hot end of the boom too</s>  sowhen a fellow came along one day and offered old dryfoos a cool hundredthousand for his farm it was all up with dryfoos</s>  hed a liked to akept the offer to himself and not done anything about it but his vanitywouldnt let him do that and when he let it out in his family the girlsoutvoted him</s>  they just made him sell</s> he wouldnt sell all</s>  he kept about eighty acres that was off in somepiece by itself but the three hundred that had the old brick houseon it and the big barnthat went and dryfoos bought him a place inmoffitt and moved into town to live on the interest of his money</s>  justwhat he had scolded and ridiculed everybody else for doing</s>  well theysay that at first he seemed like he would go crazy</s>  he hadnt anythingto do</s>  he took a fancy to that landagent and he used to go and set inhis office and ask him what he should do</s>  i haint got any horses ihaint got any cows i haint got any pigs i haint got any chickens</s>  ihaint got anything to do from sunup to sundown</s>  the fellow said thetears used to run down the old fellows cheeks and if he hadnt beenso busy himself he believed he should a cried too</s>  but most o peoplethought old dryfoos was down in the mouth because he hadnt asked morefor his farm when he wanted to buy it back and found they held it at ahundred and fifty thousand</s>  people couldnt believe he was just homesickand heartsick for the old place</s>  well perhaps he was sorry he hadntasked more thats human nature too</s> after a while something happened</s>  that landagent used to tell dryfoosto get out to europe with his money and see life a little or go andlive in washington where he could be somebody but dryfoos wouldntand he kept listening to the talk there and all of a sudden he caughton</s>  he came into that fellows one day with a plan for cutting up theeighty acres hed kept into town lots and hed got it all plotted outsowell and had so many practical ideas about it that the fellow wasastonished</s>  he went right in with him as far as dryfoos would let himand glad of the chance and they were working the thing for all it wasworth when i struck moffitt</s>  old dryfoos wanted me to go out and see thedryfoos  hendry additionguess he thought maybe id write it up andhe drove me out there himself</s>  well it was funny to see a town madestreets driven through two rows of shadetrees hard and soft

machinetuesday and then they intended to push things</s> fulkerson enjoyed the effect of his picture on march for a moment andthen went on he was mighty intelligent too and he questioned me upabout my business as sharp as i ever was questioned seemed to kind ofstrike his fancy i guess he wanted to find out if there was any moneyin it</s>  he was making money hand over hand then and he never stoppedspeculating and improving till hed scraped together three or fourhundred thousand dollars they said a million but they like roundnumbers at moffitt and i guess half a million would lay over itcomfortably and leave a few thousands to spare probably</s>  then he cameon to new york</s> fulkerson struck a match against the ribbed side of the porcelain cupthat held the matches in the centre

prompting</s> march asked him the desired question</s>  what in the world for</s> fulkerson took out his cigarette and said with a smile to spend hismoney and get his daughters into the old

old friendsquire strohfeldt youd better get out</s>  well then said i howwould you like to go into the newspaper syndicate business</s>  he gaveanother look at me and then he burst out laughing and he grabbed myhand and he just froze to it</s>  i never saw anybody so glad</s> well the long and the short of it was that i asked him round here tomaronis to dinner and before we broke up for the night we had settledthe financial side of the plan thats brought you to new york</s> i can see said fulkerson who had kept his eyes fast on marchs facethat you dont more than half like the idea of dryfoos</s>  it ought togive you more confidence in the thing than you ever had</s>  you neednt beafraid he added with some feeling that i talked dryfoos into thething for my own advantage</s> oh my dear fulkerson</s>  march protested all the more fervently becausehe was really a little guilty</s> well of course not</s>  i didnt mean you were</s>  but i just happened totell him what i wanted to go into when i could see my way to it and hecaught on of his own accord</s>  the fact is said fulkerson i guess idbetter make a clean breast of it now im at it dryfoos wanted to getsomething for that boy of his to do</s>  hes in railroads himself and hesin mines and other things and he keeps busy and he cant bear to havehis boy hanging round the house doing nothing like as if he was a girl</s> i told him that the great object of a rich man was to get his son intojust that fix but he couldnt seem to see it and the boy hated ithimself</s>  hes got a good head and he wanted to study for the ministrywhen they were all living together out on the farm but his father hadthe oldfashioned ideas about that</s>  you know they used to think that anysort of stuff was good enough to make a preacher out of but they wantedthe good timber for business and so the old man wouldnt let him</s> youll see the fellow youll like him hes no fool i can tell youand hes going to be our publisher nominally at first and actually whenive taught him the ropes a little</s> xii</s> fulkerson stopped and looked at march whom he saw lapsing into aserious silence</s>  doubtless he divined his uneasiness with the facts thathad been given him to digest</s>  he pulled out his watch and glanced at it</s> see here how would you like to go up to fortysixth street with meand drop in on old dryfoos</s>  nows your chance</s>  hes going west tomorrowand wont be back for a month or so</s>  theyll all be glad to see you andyoull understand things better when youve seen him and his family</s>  icant explain</s>

let thingstake the usual course</s>  the dryfoos ladies will want to call on her asthe lastcomer and if i treated myself en garcon now and paid thefirst visit it might complicate matters</s> well perhaps youre right said fulkerson</s>  i dont know much aboutthese things and i dont believe ma dryfoos does either</s>  he was onhis legs lighting another cigarette</s>  i suppose the girls are

another look anyway</s>  come on</s> he helped march on with his light overcoat and the little stir theymade for their departure caught the notice of the old german he lookedup from his beer at them</s>  march was more than ever impressed withsomething familiar in his face</s>  in compensation for his prudence inregard to the dryfooses he now indulged an impulse</s>  he stepped across towhere the old man sat with his bald head shining like ivory underthe gasjet and his fine patriarchal length of bearded mask takingpicturesque lights and shadows and put out his hand to him</s> lindau</s>  isnt this mr</s>  lindau</s> the old man lifted himself slowly to his feet with mechanicalpoliteness and cautiously took marchs hand</s>  yes my name is lindauhe said slowly while he

overat fulkerson who had been watching his interview with the perfunctorysmile of sympathy that people put on at the meeting of old friends</s>  iwant to introduce you to my friend mr</s>  fulkerson</s>  he and i are goinginto a literary enterprise here</s> ah</s>  zo</s>  said the old man with polite interest</s>  he took fulkersonsproffered hand and they all stood talking a few moments together</s> then fulkerson said with another look at his watch well march werekeeping mr</s>  lindau from his dinner</s> dinner</s>  cried the old man</s>  idts better than breadt and meadt

 said the old man</s>  itis the best place and march fancied him reluctant to give anotheraddress</s> to cover his consciousness he answered gayly then its aufwiedersehen with us</s>  well</s> also</s>  the old man took his hand and made a mechanical movement withhis mutilated arm as if he would have taken it in a double clasp</s>  helaughed at himself</s>  i wanted to gif you the other handt too but igafe it to your gountry a goodt while ago</s> to my country</s>  asked march with a sense of pain and yet lightly asif it were a joke of the old mans</s>  your country too lindau</s> the old man turned very grave and said almost coldly what gountryhass a poor man got mr</s>  marge</s> well you ought to have a share in the one you helped to save for usrich men lindau march returned still humoring the joke</s> the old man smiled sadly but made no answer as he sat down again</s> seems to be a little soured said fulkerson as they went down thesteps</s>  he was one of those americans whose habitual conception of lifeis unalloyed prosperity</s>  when any experience or observation of his wentcounter to it he sufferedsomething like physical pain</s>  he eagerlyshrugged away the impression left upon his buoyancy by lindau and addedto marchs continued silence what did i tell you about meeting everyman in new york that you ever knew before</s> i never expected to meat lindau in the world again said march moreto himself than to fulkerson</s>  i had an impression that he had beenkilled in the war</s>  i almost wish he had been</s> oh hello now</s>  cried fulkerson</s> march laughed but went on soberly he was a man predestined toadversity though</s>  when i first knew him out in indianapolis he wasstarving along with a sick wife and a sick newspaper</s>  it was beforethe germans had come over to the republicans generally but lindau wasfighting the antislavery battle just as naturally at indianapolis in1858 as he fought behind the barricades at berlin in 1848</s>  and yet hewas always such a gentle soul</s>  and so generous</s>  he taught me german forthe love of it he wouldnt spoil his pleasure by taking a cent from mehe seemed to get enough out of my being young and enthusiastic and outof prophesying great things for me</s>  i wonder what the poor old fellow isdoing here with that one hand of his</s> not amassing a very handsome pittance i guess as artemus ward wouldsay said fulkerson getting back some of his lightness</s>  there arelots of twohanded fellows in new york that are not doing much better iguess</s>  maybe he gets some writing on the german papers</s> i hope so</s>  hes one of the most accomplished men</s>  he used to be asplendid musicianpianistand knows eight or ten languages</s> well its astonishing said fulkerson how much lumber those germanscan carry around in their heads all their lives and never work it upinto anything</s>  its a pity they couldnt do the acquiring and letout the use of their learning to a few bright americans</s>  we could makethings hum if we could arrange em that way</s> he talked on unheeded by march who went along halfconsciouslytormented by his lightness in the pensive memories the meeting withlindau had called up</s>  was this all that sweet unselfish nature couldcome to</s>  what a homeless old age at that meagre italian table dhotewith that tall glass of beer for a halfhours oblivion</s>  that shabbydress that pathetic mutilation</s>  he must have a pension twelve dollarsa month or eighteen from a grateful country</s>  but what else did he ekeout with</s> well here we are said fulkerson cheerily</s>  he ran up the stepsbefore march and opened the carpenters temporary valve in the doorframe and led the way into a darkness smelling sweetly of unpaintedwoodwork and newly dried plaster their feat slipped on shavings andgrated on sand</s>  he scratched a match and found a candle and thenwalked about up and down stairs and lectured on the advantages of theplace</s>  he had fitted up bachelor apartments for himself in the houseand said that he was going to have a flat to let on the top floor</s>  ididnt offer it to you because i supposed youd be too proud to liveover your shop and its too small anyway only five rooms</s> yes thats too small said march shirking the other point</s> well then heres the room i intend for your office said fulkersonshowing him into a large back parlor one flight up</s>  youll have itquiet from the street noises here and you can be at home or not as youplease</s>  therell be a boy on the stairs to find out</s>  now you see thismakes the grosvenor green flat practicable if you want it</s> march felt the forces of fate closing about him and pushing him to adecision</s>  he feebly fought them off till he could have another look atthe flat</s>  then baked and subdued still more by the unexpected presenceof mrs</s>  grosvenor green herself who was occupying it so as to be ableto show it effectively he took it</s>  he was aware more than ever of itsabsurdities he knew that his wife would never cease to hate it but hehad suffered one of those eclipses of the imagination to which men ofhis temperament are subject and into which he could see no future forhis desires</s>  he felt a comfort in irretrievably committing himself andexchanging the burden of indecision for the burden of responsibility</s> i dont know said fulkerson as they walked back to his hoteltogether but you might fix it up with that lone widow and her prettydaughter to take part of their house here</s>  he seemed to be remindedof it by the fact of passing the house and march looked up at its darkfront</s>  he could not have told exactly why he felt a pang of remorseat the sight and doubtless it was more regret for having taken thegrosvenor green flat than for not having taken the widows rooms</s>  stillhe could not forget her wistfulness when his wife and he were lookingat them and her disappointment when they decided against them</s>  he hadtoyed in his aftertalk to mrs</s>  march with a sort of hypotheticalobligation they had to modify their plans so as to meet the widows wantof just such a family as theirs they had both said what a blessingit would be to her and what a pity they could not do it but they haddecided very distinctly that they could not</s>  now it seemed to him thatthey might and he asked himself whether he had not actually departed asmuch from their ideal as if he had taken board with the widow</s>  suddenlyit seemed to him that his wife asked him this too</s> i reckon said fulkerson that she could have arranged to give youyour meals in your rooms and it would have come to about the same thingas housekeeping</s> no sort of boarding can be the same as housekeeping said march</s>  iwant my little girl to have the run of a kitchen and i want the wholefamily to have the moral effect of housekeeping</s>  its demoralizing toboard in every way it isnt a home if anybody else takes the care ofit off your hands</s> well i suppose so fulkerson assented but marchs words had ahollow ring to himself and in his own mind he began to retaliate hisdissatisfaction upon fulkerson</s> he parted from him on the usual terms outwardly but he felt obscurelyabused by fulkerson in regard to the dryfooses father and son</s>  he didnot know but fulkerson had taken an advantage of him in allowing him tocommit himself to their enterprise with out fully and frankly tellinghim who and what his backer was he perceived that with young dryfoos asthe publisher and fulkerson as the general director of the paper theremight be very little play for his own ideas of its conduct</s>  perhaps itwas the hurt to his vanity involved by the recognition of this fact thatmade him forget how little choice he really had in the matter and howsince he had not accepted the offer to edit the insurance papernothing remained for him but to close with fulkerson</s>  in this moment ofsuspicion and resentment he accused fulkerson of hastening his decisionin regard to the grosvenor green apartment he now refused to considerit a decision and said to himself that if he felt disposed to do so hewould send mrs</s>  green a note reversing it in the morning</s>  but he put itall off till morning with his clothes when he went to bed he putoff even thinking what his wife would say he cast fulkerson and hisconstructive treachery out of his mind too and invited into it somepensive reveries of the past when he still stood at the parting of theways and could take this path or that</s>  in his middle life this was notpossible he must follow the path chosen long ago wherever it led</s>  hewas not master of himself as he once seemed but the servant of thosehe loved if he could do what he liked perhaps he might renounce thiswhole new york enterprise and go off somewhere out of the reach ofcare but he could not do what he liked that was very clear</s>  in thepathos of this conviction he dwelt compassionately upon the thoughtof poor old lindau he resolved to make him accept a handsome sum ofmoneymore than he could spare something that he would feel the lossofin payment of the lessons in german and fencing given so longago</s>  at the usual rate for such lessons his debt with interest fortwentyodd years would run very far into the hundreds</s>  too far heperceived for his wifes joyous approval he determined not to add theinterest or he believed that lindau would refuse the interest he put afine speech in his mouth making him do so and after that he got lindauemployment on every other week and took care of him till he died</s> through all his melancholy and munificence he was aware of sordidanxieties for having taken the grosvenor green apartment</s>  these beganto assume visible tangible shapes as he drowsed and to became personalentities from which he woke with little starts to a realization oftheir true nature and then suddenly fell fast asleep</s> in the accomplishment of the events which his reverie played with therewas much that retroactively stamped it with prophecy but much also thatwas better than he forboded</s>  he found that with regard to the grosvenorgreen apartment he had not allowed for his wifes willingness to get anysort of roof over her head again after the removal from their old homeor for the alleviations that grow up through mere custom</s>  the practicalworkings of the apartment were not so bad it had its good points andafter the first sensation of oppression in it they began to feel theconvenience of its arrangement</s>  they were at that time of life whenpeople first turn to their childrens opinion with deference and inthe loss of keenness in their own likes and dislikes consult the youngpreferences which are still so sensitive</s>  it went far to reconcile mrs</s> march to the apartment that her children were pleased with its noveltywhen this wore off for them she had herself begun to find it much moreeasily manageable than a house</s>  after she had put away several barrelsof gimcracks and folded up screens and rugs and skins and carriedthem all off to the little dark storeroom which the flat developedshe perceived at once a roominess and coziness in it unsuspected before</s> then when people began to call she had a pleasure a superiorityin saying that it was a furnished apartment and in disclaiming allresponsibility for the upholstery and decoration</s>  if march was by shealways explained that it was mr</s>  marchs fancy and amiably laughed itoff with her callers as a mannish eccentricity</s>  nobody really seemed tothink it otherwise than pretty and this again was a triumph for mrs</s> march because it showed how inferior the new york taste was to theboston taste in such matters</s> march submitted silently to his punishment and laughed with her beforecompany at his own eccentricity</s>  she had been so preoccupied with theadjustment of the family to its new quarters and circumstances that thetime passed for laying his misgivings if they were misgivings aboutfulkerson before her and when an occasion came for expressing themthey had themselves passed in the anxieties of getting forward thefirst number of every other week</s>  he kept these from her too andthe business that brought them to new york had apparently dropped intoabeyance before the questions of domestic economy that presented andabsented themselves</s>  march knew his wife to be a woman of good mind andin perfect sympathy with him but he understood the limitations ofher perspective and if he was not too wise he was too experiencedto intrude upon it any affairs of his till her own were reduced to theright order and proportion</s>  it would have been folly to talk to her offulkersons conjecturable uncandor while she was in doubt whether hercook would like the kitchen or her two servants would consent to roomtogether and till it was decided what school tom should go to andwhether bella should have lessons at home or not the relation whichmarch was to bear to the dryfooses as owner and publisher was not tobe discussed with his wife</s>  he might drag it in but he was aware thatwith her mind distracted by more immediate interests he could not getfrom her that judgment that reasoned divination which he relied uponso much</s>  she would try she would do her best but the result would be aview clouded and discolored by the effort she must make</s> he put the whole matter by and gave himself to the details of the workbefore him</s>  in this he found not only escape but reassurance for itbecame more and more apparent that whatever was nominally the structureof the business a man of his qualifications and his instincts could nothave an insignificant place in it</s>  he had also the consolation of likinghis work and of getting an instant grasp of it that grew constantlyfirmer and closer</s>  the joy of knowing that he had not made a mistake wasgreat</s>  in giving rein to ambitions long forborne he seemed to get backto the youth when he had indulged them first and after half a lifetimepassed in pursuits alien to his nature he was feeling the serenehappiness of being mated through his work to his early love</s>  from theoutside the spectacle might have had its pathos and it is not easy tojustify such an experiment as he had made at his time of life exceptupon the ground where he rested from its considerationthe ground ofnecessity</s> his work was more in his thoughts than himself however and as the timefor the publication of the first number of his periodical came nearerhis cares all centred upon it</s>  without fixing any date fulkerson hadannounced it and pushed his announcements with the shameless vigor ofa born advertiser</s>  he worked his interest with the press to the utmostand paragraphs of a variety that did credit to his ingenuity were afloateverywhere</s>  some of them were speciously unfavorable in tone theycriticised and even ridiculed the principles on which the new departurein literary journalism was based</s>  others defended it others yet deniedthat this rumored principle was really the principle</s>  all contributed tomake talk</s>  all proceeded from the same fertile invention</s> march observed with a degree of mortification that the talk was verylittle of it in the new york press there the references to the novelenterprise were slight and cold</s>  but fulkerson said dont mind thatold man</s>  its the whole country that makes or breaks a thing like thisnew york has very little to do with it</s>  now if it were a play it wouldbe different</s>  new york does make or break a play but it doesnt make orbreak a book it doesnt make or break a magazine</s>  the great mass ofthe readers are outside of new york and the rural districts are whatwe have got to go for</s>  they dont read much in new york they write andtalk about what theyve written</s>  dont you worry</s> the rumor of fulkersons connection with the enterprise accompanied manyof the paragraphs and he was able to stay marchs thirst for employmentby turning over to him from day to day heaps of the manuscripts whichbegan to pour in from his old syndicate writers as well as fromadventurous volunteers all over the country</s>  with these in hand marchbegan practically to plan the first number

of feet hands faces hung to nails about prints sketches in oiland watercolor stuck here and there lower down a rickety tablewith paint and palettes and bottles of varnish and siccative tossedcomfortlessly on it an easel with a strip of some faded mediaeval silktrailing from it a lay figure simpering in incomplete nakedness withits head on one side and a stocking on one leg and a japanese dressdropped before it dusty rugs and skins kicking over the varnishedfloor canvases faced to the mopboard an open trunk overflowing withcostumes these features one might notice anywhere</s>  but besides therewas a bookcase with an unusual number of books in it and there was anopen colonial writingdesk clawfooted brasshandled and scutcheonedwith foreign periodicalsfrench and englishlittering its leaf andsome pages of manuscript scattered among them</s>  above all there wasa sculptors revolving stand supporting a bust which beaton wasmodelling with an eye fixed as simultaneously as possible on the clayand on the head of the old man who sat on the platform beside it</s> few men have been able to get through the world with several gifts toadvantage in all and most men seem handicapped for the race if theyhave more than one</s>  but they are apparently immensely interested as wellas distracted by them</s>  when beaton was writing he would have agreedup to a certain point with any one who said literature was his properexpression but then when he was painting up to a certain pointhe would have maintained against the world that he was a colorist andsupremely a colorist</s>  at the certain point in either art he was apt tobreak away in a frenzy of disgust and wreak himself upon some other</s> in these moods he sometimes designed elevations of buildings verystriking very original very chic very everything but habitable</s>  itwas in this way that he had tried his hand on sculpture which he hadat first approached rather slightingly as a mere decorative accessoryof architecture</s>  but it had grown in his respect till he maintainedthat the accessory business ought to be all the other way that templesshould be raised to enshrine statues

might have been an architect but wouldcertainly never be a sculptor</s>  at the same time he did some hurriednervous things that had a popular charm and that sold in plasterreproductions to the profit of another</s>  beaton justly despised thepopular charm in these as well as in the paintings he sold from time totime he said it was flat burglary to have taken money for them andhe would have been living almost wholly upon the bounty of the oldtombstonecutter in syracuse if it had not been for the syndicateletters which he supplied to fulkerson for ten dollars a week</s> they were very well

the syndicate letterwhich he knew fulkerson would be coming for in the morning</s>  he remainedtalking so long after dinner in the same strain as he had painted andwritten in that he could not finish his letter that night</s>  the nextmorning while he was making his tea for breakfast the postman broughthim a letter from his father enclosing a little check and begging himwith tender almost deferential urgence to come as lightly upon him aspossible for just now his expenses were very heavy</s>  it brought tears ofshame into beatons eyesthe fine smouldering floating eyes that manyladies admired under the thick bangand he said to himself that if hewere half a man he would go home and go to work cutting gravestones inhis fathers shop</s>  but he would wait at least to finish his pictureand as a sop to his conscience to stay its immediate ravening heresolved to finish that syndicate letter first and borrow enough moneyfrom fulkerson to be able to send his fathers check back or

saw that he must getthrough with him before he finished either the picture or the letter hewould have to pay him for the time anyway</s>  he utilized the remorse withwhich he was tingling to give his judas an expression which he foundnovel in the treatment of that charactera look of such touchingappealing selfabhorrence that beatons artistic joy in it amounted torapture between the breathless

beacon disdained to ask an explanation but he internally lowered hiscrest while he continued to look at fulkerson without changing hisdefiant countenance</s>  this suited fulkerson well enough and he went onwith relish im going out of the syndicate business old man and imon a new thing</s>  he put his leg over the back of a chair and rested hisfoot on its seat and with one hand in his pocket he

some water into his mouthfrom a tumbler which he blew in a fine mist over the head of judasbefore swathing it in a dirty cotton cloth he washed his brushes andset his palette he put up on his easel

worked well in literature and itwill work well in art</s> it wont work well in art said beaton</s>  there you have a totallydifferent set of conditions</s>  what youll get by inviting

up a school of illustration said fulkerson with cynicalsecurity</s>  you can read the things and explain em and your pupils canmake their sketches under your eye</s>  they wouldnt be much furtherout than most illustrations are if they never knew what they wereillustrating</s>  you might select from what comes in and make up a sort ofpictorial variations to the literature without any particular referenceto it</s>  well i understand you to accept</s> no you dont</s> that is to consent to help us with your advice and criticism</s>  thatsall i want</s>  it wont commit you to anything and you

march</s>  thats going to be our address</s>  heput a card on the table beside the envelope and beaton allowed himto go without making him take the check back</s>  he had remembered hisfathers plea that unnerved him and he promised himself again toreturn his fathers poor little check and to work on that picture andgive it to fulkerson for the check he had left and for his back debts</s> he resolved to go to work on the picture at once he had set his palettefor it but first he looked at fulkersons check</s>  it was for only fiftydollars and the canny scotch blood in beaton rebelled he could not letthis picture go for any such money he felt a little like a man whosegenerosity has been trifled with</s>  the conflict of emotions broke him upand he could not work</s> ivthe day wasted away in beatons hands at halfpast four oclock he wentout to tea at the house of a lady who was at home that afternoon fromfour till seven</s>  by this time beaton was in possession of one of thoseother selves of which we each have several about us and was again thelaconic staccato rather worldlified young artist whose moments of acontrolled utterance and a certain distinction of manner

crepuscular uncertainty to the fewobjects the dim pictures the unexcited upholstery of the rooms</s>  onebreathed free of bricabrac there and the newcomer breathed softly asone does on going into church after service has begun</s>  this might be asuggestion from the voiceless behavior of the manservant who letyou in but it was also because mrs</s>  horns at home was a ceremony adecorum and not festival</s>  at far greater houses there was more gayetyat richer houses there was more freedom the suppression at mrs</s>  hornswas a personal not a social effect it was an efflux of her characterdemure silentious vague but very correct</s> beaton easily found his way to her around the grouped skirts and amongthe detached figures and received a pressure of welcome from the handwhich she momentarily relaxed from the teapot</s>  she sat behind a tableput crosswise of a remote corner and offered tea to people whom a nieceof hers received provisionally or sped finally in the outer room</s>  theydid not usually take tea and when they did they did not usually drinkit but beaton was feverishly glad of his cup he took rum and lemon init and stood talking at mrs</s>  horns side till

place likest</s>  barnaby understand how it is in town</s> yes said beaton</s>  he stirred his tea while inwardly he tried tobelieve that he had really discouraged the leightons from coming to

and stretched her glove across the teacups</s> beaton got himself away and out of the house with a much briefer adieuto the niece than he had meant to make</s>  the patronizing compassion ofmrs</s>  horn for the leightons filled him with indignation toward hertoward himself</s>  there was no reason why he should not have ignoredthem as he had done but there was a feeling</s>  it was his nature tobe careless and he had been spoiled into recklessness he neglectedeverybody and only remembered them when it suited his whim or hisconvenience but he fiercely resented the inattentions of others towardhimself</s>  he had no scruple about breaking an engagement or failingto keep an appointment he made promises without thinking of theirfulfilment and not because he was a faithless person but because hewas imaginative and expected at the time to do what he said but wasfickle and so did not</s>  as most of his shortcomings were of a societysort no great harm was done to anybody else</s>  he

beaton had no presentintention of looking them up or sending mrs</s>  horn their address</s>  asa matter of fact he never did send it but he happened to meet mr</s> wetmore and his wife at the restaurant where he dined and he got itof the painter for himself</s>  he did not ask him how miss leighton wasgetting on but wetmore launched out with alma for a tacit text onthe futility of women

resentment she meanthim to feel that his not coming sooner had been noticed</s>  miss woodburnbubbled and gurgled on and did what she could to mitigate hispunishment but she did not feel authorized to

seemed to him that it would bea good thing if she should find it out after his death</s>  he imagined herbeing touched by it under those circumstances</s> vi</s> in the morning it seemed to beaton that he had done himself injustice</s> when he uncovered his judas and looked at it he could not believethat the man who was capable of such work deserved the punishmentmiss leighton had inflicted upon him</s>  he still forgave her but in thepresence of a thing like that he could not help respecting himself hebelieved that if she could see it she would be sorry that she had cutherself off from his acquaintance</s>  he carried this strain of convictionall through his syndicate letter which he now took out of his desk andfinished with an increasing security of his opinions and a mountingseverity in his judgments</s>  he retaliated upon the general condition ofart among us the pangs of wounded vanity which alma had made him feeland he folded up his manuscript and put it in his pocket almosthealed of his humiliation</s>  he had been able to escape from its sting soentirely while he was writing that the notion of making his life moreand more literary commended itself to him</s>  as it was now evidentthat the future was to be one of renunciation of selfforgetting anoblivion tinged with bitterness he formlessly reasoned in favor ofreconsidering his resolution against fulkersons offer</s>  one must callit reasoning but it was rather that swift internal dramatization whichconstantly goes on in persons of excitable sensibilities and which nowseemed to sweep beaton physically along toward the every other weekoffice and carried his mind with lightning celerity on to a time whenhe should have given that journal such quality and authority in mattersof art as had never been enjoyed by any in america before</s>  with theprosperity which he made attend his work he changed the character of theenterprise and with fulkersons enthusiastic support he gave the publican art journal of as high grade as les lettres et les arts and verymuch that sort of thing</s>  all this involved now the unavailing regret ofalma leighton and now his reconciliation with her they were marriedin grace church because beaton had once seen a marriage there and hadintended to paint a picture of it some time</s> nothing in these fervid fantasies prevented his responding with duedryness to fulkersons cheery hello old man</s>  when he found himselfin the building fitted up for the every other week office</s>  fulkersonsroom was back of the smaller one occupied by the bookkeeper they hadbeen respectively the receptionroom and diningroom of the little placein its dwellinghouse days and they had been simply and tastefullytreated in their transformation into business

well have you come round to go to work</s>  just hang up your coat on thefloor anywhere fulkerson went on</s> ive come to bring you that letter said beaton all the morehaughtily because he found that fulkerson was not alone when he welcomedhim in these free and easy terms</s>  there was a quietlooking man ratherstout and a little above the middle height with a full closecroppedirongray beard seated beyond the table where fulkerson tilted himselfback with his knees set against it and leaning against the mantelthere was a young man with a singularly gentle face in which the lookof goodness qualified and transfigured a certain simplicity</s>  his largeblue eyes were somewhat prominent and his rather narrow face was drawnforward in a nose a little too long perhaps if it had not been for thefull chin deeply cut below the lip and jutting firmly forward</s> introduce you to mr</s>  march our editor mr</s>  beaton fulkerson saidrolling his head in the direction of the elder man and then

the uneasy concession which people make to acharacter when they do not quite approve of the characters language</s> what mr</s>  march and i are trying to do is to carry on this thing so thatthere wont be any money in itor very little and were planningto give the public a better article for the price than its ever hadbefore</s>  now heres a dummy weve had made up for every other week andas weve decided to adopt it we would naturally like your opinion ofit sos to know what opinion to have of you</s>
 he reached forward andpushed toward beaton a volume a little above the size of the ordinaryduodecimo book its ivorywhite pebbled paper cover was prettilyillustrated with a watercolored design irregularly washed over thegreater part of its surface quite across the page at top and narrowingfrom right to left as it descended</s>  in the triangular space left blankthe title of the periodical and the publishers imprint were tastefullylettered so as to be partly covered by the background of color</s> its like some of those tartarin books of daudets said beaconlooking at it with more interest than he suffered to be seen</s>  but itsa book not a magazine</s>  he opened its pages of thick mellow whitepaper with uncut leaves the first few pages experimentally printed inthe type intended to be used and illustrated with some sketches drawninto and over the text for the sake of the effect</s>
a daniela daniel come to judgment</s>  sit down danel and take iteasy</s>  fulkerson pushed a chair toward beaton who dropped into it</s> youre right danel its a book to all practical intents

no namefor the transactionbut to give em</s>  and what we want to get out ofyoubeg borrow buy or steal from you is an opinion whether we shallmake the american public this princely present in paper

done looking at the dummy and he dropped it on the tablebefore fulkerson who pushed it away apparently to free himself frompartiality</s>  i dont know anything about the business side and i canttell about the effect of either style on the sales but youll spoilthe whole character of the cover if you use anything thicker than thatthickish paper</s> all right very good firstrate</s>  the ayes have it</s>  paper it is</s>  idont mind telling you that we had decided for that paper before youcame in</s>  mr</s>  march wanted it because he felt in his bones just theway you do about it and mr</s>  dryfoos wanted it because hes thecountingroom incarnate and its cheaper and i wanted it becausei always like to go with the majority</s>  now what do you think of thatlittle design itself</s> the sketch</s>  beaton pulled the book toward him again and looked at itagain</s>  rather decorative</s>  drawings not remarkable</s>  graceful rathernice</s>  he pushed the book away again and fulkerson pulled it to hisaide of the table</s> well thats a piece of that amateur trash you despise so much</s>  i wentto a painter i knowbytheway he was guilty of suggesting you for thisthing but i told him i was ahead of himand i got him to submit myidea to one of his class and thats the result</s>  well now there aintanything in this world that sells a book like a pretty cover and weregoing to have a pretty cover for every other week every time</s>  wevecut loose from the old traditional quarto literary newspaper size andweve cut loose from the old twocolumn big page magazine size weregoing to

to supply the floating femalesgracefully airing themselves against a sunset or something of thatkind</s>  beaton frowned in embarrassment while fulkerson went onphilosophically its astonishing how you

there</s>  what im after is the factthat were going to have variety in our titlepages and we are going tohave novelty in the illustrations of the body of the book</s>  march hereif he had his own way wouldnt have any illustrations at all</s> not because i dont like them mr</s>  beacon march interposed butbecause i like them too much</s>  i find that i look at the pictures in anillustrated article

off</s> like the society beauties on the stage people go in for the beautyso much that they dont know what the play is</s>  but the boxoffice getsthere all the same and thats what mr</s>  dryfoos wants</s>  fulkerson lookedup gayly at mr</s>  dryfoos who smiled deprecatingly</s> it was different march went on when the illustrations used to bebad</s>  then the text had some chance</s> old legitimate drama days when ugliness and genius combined to stormthe galleries said fulkerson</s> we can still make them bad enough said beaton ignoring fulkerson inhis remark to march</s> fulkerson took the reply upon himself</s>  well you neednt make em sobad as the oldstyle cuts but you can make them unobtrusive modestlyretiring</s>  weve got hold of a process something like that those

think it will succeed</s>  i think we can dosome good in it</s> march asked rather absently some good</s>  then he added oh yesi think we can</s>  what do you mean by good</s>  improve the public taste</s> elevate the standard of literature</s>  give young authors and artists achance</s> this was the only good that had ever been in marchs mind except thegood that was to come in a material way

thinking that some time we might help along</s>  if we were to havethose sketches of yours about life in every part of new yorkmarchs authorial vanity was tickled</s>  fulkerson has been talking to youabout them</s>  he seemed to think they would be a card</s>  he believes thattheres no subject so fascinating to the general average of peoplethroughout the country as life in new york city and he liked my notionof doing these things</s>  march hoped that dryfoos would answer thatfulkerson was perfectly enthusiastic about his notion but he did notneed this stimulus and at any rate he went on without it</s>  the factis its something that struck my fancy the moment i came here i foundmyself intensely interested in the place and i began to make notesconsciously and unconsciously at once</s>  yes i believe i can getsomething quite attractive out of it</s>  i dont in the least know what itwill be yet except that it will be very desultory and i couldntat all say when i can get at it</s>  if

be a sense ofthis that made him hang his head or turn it away at such times</s> thats true said march from the surface only</s>  and then thosephases of low life are immensely picturesque</s>  of course we must try toget the contrasts of luxury for the sake of the full effect</s>  that wontbe so easy</s>  you cant penetrate to the dinnerparty of a millionaireunder the wing of a detective as

still something can be done in that way by tactand patience</s> vii</s> that evening march went with his wife to return the call of the dryfoosladies</s>  on their way uptown in the elevated he told her of his talkwith young dryfoos</s>  i confess i was a little ashamed before himafterward for having looked at the matter so entirely from the aestheticpoint of view</s>  but of course you know if i went to work at thosethings with an ethical intention explicitly in mind i should spoilthem</s> of course said his wife</s>  she had always heard him say something ofthis kind about such things</s> he went on but i suppose thats just the point that such a nature asyoung dryfooss cant get hold of or keep hold of</s>  were a queer lotdown there isabelperfect menagerie</s>  if it hadnt been that fulkersongot us together and really seems to know what he did it for i shouldsay he was the oddest stick among us</s>  but when i think of myself and myown crankiness for the literary department and young dryfoos who oughtreally to be in the pulpit or a monastery or something for publisherand that young beaton who probably hasnt a moral fibre in hiscomposition for the art man i dont know but we could give fulkersonodds and still beat him in oddity</s> his wife heaved a deep sigh of apprehension of renunciation ofmonition</s>  well im glad you can feel so light about it basil</s> light</s>  i feel gay</s>  with fulkerson at the helm i tell you the rocks andthe lee shore had better keep out of the way</s>  he laughed with pleasurein his metaphor</s>  just when you think fulkerson has taken

march</s>  he was the best and kindest mani ever saw the most highminded the most generous</s>  he lost a hand inthe war that helped to save us and keep us possible and that stump ofhis is character enough for me</s> oh you dont think i could have meant anything against him</s>  said mrs</s> march with the tender fervor that every woman who lived in the time ofthe war must feel for those who suffered in it</s>  all that i meant wasthat i hoped you would not get mixed up with him too much</s>  youre so aptto be carried away by your impulses</s> they didnt carry me very far away in the direction of poor old lindauim ashamed to think said march</s>  i meant all sorts of fine things byhim after i met him and then i forgot him and i had to be reminded ofhim by fulkerson</s> she did not answer him and he fell into a remorseful reverie in whichhe rehabilitated lindau anew and provided handsomely for his old age</s> he got him buried with military honors and had a shaft raised over himwith a medallion likeness by beaton and an epitaph by himself bythe time they reached fortysecond street there was no time to writelindaus life however briefly before the train stopped</s> they had to walk up four blocks and then half a block across before theycame to the indistinctive brownstone house where the dryfooses lived</s>  itwas larger than some in the same block but the next neighborhood of ahuge apartmenthouse dwarfed it again</s>  march thought he recognized thevery flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor but he didnot tell his wife he made her notice the transition character of thestreet which had been mostly built up in apartmenthouses with hereand there a single dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them tothat jagtoothed effect on the skyline so often observable in such newyork streets</s>  i dont know exactly what the old gentleman bought herefor he said as they waited on the steps after ringing unless heexpects to turn it into

theircards upstairs</s>  the drawingroom where he said they could sit downwhile he went on this errand was delicately decorated in white andgold and furnished with a sort of extravagant good taste there wasnothing to object to in the satin furniture the pale soft richcarpet the pictures and the bronze and china bricabrac except thattheir costliness was too evident everything in the room meant money tooplainly and too much of it</s>  the marches recognized this in the hoarsewhispers which people cannot get their voices above when they tryto talk away the interval of waiting in such

descended the station stairs at chatham square with a sense of theneglected opportunities of painters in that locality</s>  he said to himselfthat if one of those fellows were to see in naples that turmoil of carstrucks and teams of every sort intershot with footpassengers goingand coming to and from the crowded pavements under the web of therailroad tracks overhead and amid the spectacular

their simple pathos he paid the tribute of a laugh whenthe poet turned as he sometimes did from his conception of angel andmartyr motherhood and portrayed the mother in her more familiar phasesof virtue and duty with the retributive shingle or slipper in her hand</s> he bought a pocketful of this literature popular in a sense which themost successful book can never be and enlisted the ballad

words violent enough butin connection with what he remembered of the cheery poetic hopefulidealist they were even more curious than lamentable</s>  in his own lifeof comfortable reverie he had never heard any one talk so before but hehad read something of the kind now and then in blatant labor newspaperswhich he had accidentally fallen in with and once at a strikersmeeting he had heard rich people denounced with the same frenzy</s>  he hadmade his own reflections upon the tastelessness of the rhetoric andthe obvious buncombe of the motive and he had not taken the matterseriously</s> he could not doubt lindaus sincerity and he wondered how he came tothat way of thinking</s>  from his experience of himself he accounted fora prevailing literary quality in it he decided it to be from lindausreading and feeling rather than his reflection</s>  that was the notion heformed of some things he had met with in ruskin to much the same effecthe regarded them with amusement as the chimeras of a rhetorician runaway with by his phrases</s> but as to lindau the chief thing in his mind was a conception of thedroll irony of a situation in which so fervid a hater of millionairesshould be working indirectly at least for the prosperity of a man likedryfoos who as march understood had got his money together out ofevery gamblers chance in speculation and all a schemers thrift fromthe error and need of others</s>  the situation was not more incongruoushowever than all the rest of the every other week affair</s>
 it seemedto him that there were no crazy fortuities that had not tended to itsexistence and as time went on and the day drew near for the issue ofthe first number the sense of this intensified till the whole lost atmoments the quality of a waking fact and came to be rather a fantasticfiction of sleep</s> yet the heterogeneous forces did cooperate to a reality which marchcould not deny at least in their presence and the first number wasrepresentative of all their nebulous intentions in a tangible form</s>  asa result it was so respectable that march began to respect theseintentions began to respect himself for combining and embodying themin the volume which appealed to him with a novel fascination whenthe first advance copy was laid upon his desk</s>  every detail of it wastiresomely familiar already but the whole had a fresh interest now</s> he now saw how extremely fit and effective miss leightons decorativedesign for the cover was printed in black and brickred on the delicategray tone of the paper</s>  it was at once attractive and refined and hecredited beaton with quite all he merited in working it over to theactual shape</s>  the touch and the taste of the art editor were presentthroughout the number</s>  as fulkerson said beaton had caught on with thedelicacy of a hummingbird and the tenacity of a bulldog to the virtuesof their illustrative process and had worked it for all it was worth</s> there were seven papers in the number and a poem on the last page ofthe cover and he had found some graphic comment for each</s>  it was alarger proportion than would afterward be allowed but for once in a wayit was allowed</s>  fulkerson said they could not expect to get their moneyback on that first number anyway</s>  seven of the illustrations werebeatons two or three he got from practised hands the rest were thework of unknown people which he had suggested and then related andadapted with unfailing ingenuity to the different papers</s>  he handledthe illustrations with such sympathy as not to destroy their individualquality and that indefinable charm which comes from good amateur workin whatever art</s>  he rescued them from their weaknesses and errors whilehe left in them the evidence of the pleasure with which a clever youngman or a sensitive girl or a refined woman had done them</s>  inevitablyfrom his manipulation however the art of the number acquiredhomogeneity and there was nothing casual in its appearance</s>  the resultmarch eagerly owned was better than the literary result and he foresawthat the number would be sold and praised chiefly for its pictures</s>  yethe was not ashamed of the literature and he indulged his admiration ofit the more freely because he had not only not written it but in a wayhad not edited it</s>  to be sure he had chosen all the material but hehad not voluntarily put it all together for that number it had largelyput itself together as every number of every magazine does and as itseems more and more to do in the experience of every editor</s>  therehad to be of course a story and then a sketch of travel</s>  there wasa literary essay and a social essay there was a dramatic trifle verygay very light there was a dashing criticism on the new picturesthe new plays the new books the new fashions and then there was thetranslation of a bit of vivid russian realism which the editor owed tolindaus exploration of the foreign periodicals left with him lindauwas himself a romanticist of the victor hugo sort but he said thisfragment of dostoyevski was good of its kind</s>  the poem was a bitof society verse with a backward look into simpler and wholesomerexperiences</s> fulkerson was extremely proud of the number but he said it was toogoodtoo good from every point of view</s>  the cover was too good and thepaper was too good and that device of rough edges which got over theobjection to uncut leaves while it secured their aesthetic effect was athing that he trembled for though he rejoiced in it as a stroke ofthe highest genius</s>  it had come from beaton at the last moment as acompromise when the problem of the vulgar croppiness of cut leaves andthe unpopularity of uncut leaves seemed to have no solution but suicide</s> fulkerson was still morally crawling round on his hands and knees ashe said in abject gratitude at beatons feet though he had his qualmshis questions and he declared that beaton was the most inspiredass since balaams</s>  were all asses of course he admitted insemiapology to march but were no such asses as beaton</s>  he said thatif the tasteful decorativeness of the thing did not kill it with thepublic outright its literary excellence would give it the finishingstroke</s>  perhaps that might be overlooked in the impression of noveltywhich a first number would give but it must never happen again</s>  heimplored march to promise that it should never happen again he saidtheir only hope was in the immediate cheapening of the whole affair</s>  itwas bad enough to give the public too much quantity for their money butto throw in such quality as that was simply ruinous it must be stopped</s> these were the expressions of his intimate moods every front that hepresented to the public wore a glow of lofty of devout exultation</s>  hispride in the number gushed out in fresh bursts of rhetoric to everyone whom he could get to talk with him about it</s>  he worked the personalkindliness of the press to the utmost</s>  he did not mind making himselfridiculous or becoming a joke in the good cause as he called it</s>  hejoined in the applause when a humorist at the club feigned to drop deadfrom his chair at fulkersons introduction of the topic and he went ontalking that first number into the surviving spectators</s>  he stood treatupon all occasions and he lunched attaches of the press at all hours</s> he especially befriended the correspondents of the newspapers of othercities for as he explained to march those fellows could give him anyamount of advertising simply as literary gossip</s>  many of the fellowswere ladies who could not be so summarily asked out to lunch butfulkersons ingenuity was equal to every exigency and he contrivedsomehow to make each of these feel that she had been possessed ofexclusive information</s>  there was a moment when march conjectureda willingness in fulkerson to work mrs</s>  march into the advertisingdepartment by means of a tea to these ladies and their friends whichshe should administer in his apartment but he did not encouragefulkerson to be explicit and the moment passed</s>  afterward when he toldhis wife about it he was astonished to find that she would not haveminded doing it for fulkerson and he experienced another proof ofthe bluntness of the feminine instincts in some directions and of thepersonal favor which fulkerson seemed to enjoy with the whole sex</s>  thisalone was enough to account for the willingness of these correspondentsto write about the first number but march accused him of sending it totheir addresses with boxes of jacqueminot roses and huyler candy</s> fulkerson let him enjoy his joke</s>  he said that he would do that oranything else for the good cause short of marrying the whole circle offemale correspondents</s> march was inclined to hope that if the first number had been madetoo good for the country at large the more enlightened taste ofmetropolitan journalism would invite a compensating favor for it in newyork</s>  but first fulkerson and then the event proved him wrong</s>  in spiteof the quality of the magazine and in spite of the kindness whichso many newspaper men felt for fulkerson the notices in the new yorkpapers seemed grudging and provisional to the ardor of the editor</s>  amerit in the work was acknowledged and certain defects in it for whichmarch had trembled were ignored but the critics astonished him byselecting for censure points which he was either proud of or had nevernoticed which being now brought to his notice he still could not feelwere faults</s>  he owned to fulkerson that if they had said so and soagainst it he could have agreed with them but that to say thus and sowas preposterous and that if the advertising had not been adjustedwith such generous recognition of the claims of the different papers heshould have known the countingroom was at the bottom of it</s>  as it washe could only attribute it to perversity or stupidity</s>  it was certainlystupid to condemn a magazine novelty like every other week forbeing novel and to augur that if it failed it would fail through itsdeparture from the lines on which all the other prosperous magazines hadbeen built was in the last degree perverse and it looked malicious</s> the fact that it was neither exactly a book nor a magazine ought tobe for it and not against it since it would invade no other field itwould prosper on no ground but its own</s> xiv</s> the more march thought of the injustice of the new york press whichhad not however attacked the literary quality of the number the morebitterly he resented it and his wifes indignation superheated hisown</s>  every other week had become a very personal affair with the wholefamily the children shared their parents disgust belle was outspokenin her denunciations of a venal press</s>  mrs</s>  march saw nothing butruin ahead and began tacitly to plan a retreat to boston and anestablishment retrenched to the basis of two thousand a year</s>  she shedsome secret tears in anticipation of the privations which this mustinvolve but when fulkerson came to see march rather late the night ofthe publication day she nobly told him that if the worst came to theworst she could only have the kindliest feeling toward him and shouldnot regard him as in the

smiledoutwardly inwardly he was divided between admiration of miss woodburnsarch beauty and appreciation of the skill which reproduced it at thesame time he was trying to remember whether march had

thepublishing and editorial force with certain of the more representativeartists and authors sitting down to a modest supper in mrs</s>  leightonsparlors he conceived of a dinner at delmonicos with the principalliterary and artistic people throughout the country as guests and aninexhaustible hospitality to reporters and correspondents from whomparagraphs prophetic and historic would flow weeks before and afterthe first of the series</s>  he said the thing was a new departure inmagazines it amounted to something in literature as radical as theamerican revolution in politics it was the idea of self government inthe arts and it was this idea that had never yet been fully developedin regard to it</s>  that was what must be done in the speeches at thedinner and the speeches must be reported</s>  then it would go likewildfire</s>  he asked march whether he thought mr</s>  depew could be got tocome mark twain he was sure would come he was a literary man</s>  theyought to invite mr</s>  evarts and the cardinal and the leading protestantdivines</s>  his ambition stopped at nothing nothing but the question ofexpense there he had to wait the return of the elder dryfoos from thewest and dryfoos was still delayed at moffitt and fulkerson openlyconfessed that he was afraid he would stay there till his own enthusiasmescaped in other activities other plans</s> fulkerson was as little likely as possible to fall under a superstitioussubjection to another man but march could not help seeing that in thispossible measure dryfoos was fulkersons fetish</s>  he did not reverehim march decided because it was not in fulkersons nature torevere anything he could like and dislike but he could not respect</s> apparently however dryfoos daunted him somehow and besides the homagewhich those who have not pay to those who have fulkerson rendereddryfoos the tribute of a feeling which march could only define as asort of bewilderment</s>  as well as march could make out this feeling wasevoked by the spectacle of dryfooss unfailing luck which fulkerson wasfond of dazzling himself with</s>  it perfectly consisted with a keen senseof whatever was sordid and selfish in a man on whom his career must havehad its inevitable effect</s>  he liked to philosophize the case with marchto recall dryfoos as he was when he first met him still somewhat in thesap at moffitt and to study the processes by which he imagined him tohave dried into the hardened speculator without even the pretence toany advantage but his own in his ventures</s>  he was aware of painting thecharacter too vividly and he warned march not to accept it exactly inthose tints but to subdue them and shade it for himself</s>  he said thatwhere his advantage was not concerned there was ever so much good indryfoos and that if in some things he had grown inflexible he hadexpanded in others to the full measure of the vast scale on which hedid business</s>  it had seemed a little odd to march that a man should putmoney into such an enterprise as every other week and go off aboutother affairs not only without any sign of anxiety but without anysort of interest</s>  but fulkerson said that was the splendid side ofdryfoos</s>  he had a courage a magnanimity that was equal to the strainof any such uncertainty</s>  he had faced the music once for all when heasked fulkerson what the thing would cost in the different degreesof potential failure and then he had gone off leaving everything tofulkerson and the younger dryfoos with the instruction simply to goahead and not bother him about it</s>  fulkerson called that pretty tall foran old fellow who used to bewail the want of pigs and chickens to occupyhis mind</s>  he alleged it as another proof of the versatility of theamerican mind and of the grandeur of institutions and opportunitiesthat let every man grow to his full size so that any man in americacould run the concern if necessary</s>  he believed that old dryfoos couldstep into bismarcks shoes and run the german empire at ten daysnotice or about as long as it would take him to go from new york toberlin</s>  but bismarck would not know anything about dryfooss plans tilldryfoos got ready to show his hand</s>  fulkerson himself did not pretendto say what the old man had been up to since he went west</s>  he was atmoffitt first and then he was at chicago and then he had gone out todenver to look after some mines he had out there and a railroad or twoand now he was at moffitt again</s>  he was supposed to be closing up hisaffairs there but nobody could say</s> fulkerson told march the morning after dryfoos returned that he had notonly not pulled out at moffitt but had gone in deeper ten times deeperthan ever</s>  he was in a royal goodhumor fulkerson reported and wasgoing to drop into the office on his way up from the street marchunderstood wall street that afternoon</s>  he was tickled to death withevery other week so far as it had gone and was anxious to pay hisrespects to the editor</s> march accounted for some rhetoric in this but let it flatter him andprepared himself for a meeting about which he could see that fulkersonwas only less nervous than he had shown himself about the publicreception of the first number</s>  it gave march a disagreeable feeling ofbeing owned and of being about to be inspected by his proprietor buthe fell back upon such independence as he could find in the thought ofthose two thousand dollars of income beyond the caprice of his ownerand maintained an outward serenity</s> he was a little ashamed afterward of the resolution it had cost him todo so</s>  it was not a question of dryfooss physical presence that wasrather effective than otherwise and carried a suggestion of moneyedindifference to convention in the gray business suit of provincial cutand the low widebrimmed hat of flexible black felt</s>  he had a stickwith an oldfashioned top of buckhorn worn smooth and bright by the palmof his hand which had not lost its character in fat and which had ahistory of former work in its enlarged knuckles though it was now assoft as marchs and must once have been small even for a man of mr</s> dryfooss stature he was below the average size</s>  but what struck marchwas the fact that dryfoos seemed furtively conscious of being a countryperson and of being aware that in their meeting he was to be triedby other tests than those which would have availed him as a shrewdspeculator</s>  he evidently had some curiosity about march as the firstof his kind whom he had encountered some such curiosity as the countryschool trustee feels and tries to hide in the presence of the newschoolmaster</s>  but the whole affair was of course on a higher plane onone side dryfoos was much more a man of the world than march was andhe probably divined this at once and rested himself upon the fact ina measure</s>  it seemed to be his preference that his son should introducethem for he came upstairs with conrad and they had fairly madeacquaintance before fulkerson joined them</s> conrad offered to leave them at once but his father made him stay</s>  ireckon mr</s>  march and i havent got anything so private to talk aboutthat we want to keep it from the other partners</s>  well mr</s>  march areyou getting used to new york yet</s>  it takes a little time</s> oh yes</s>  but not so much time as most places</s>  everybody belongs more orless in new york nobody has to belong here altogether</s> yes that is so</s>  you can try it and go away if you dont like it agood deal easier than you could from a smaller place</s>  wouldnt make somuch talk would it</s>  he glanced at march with a jocose light inhis shrewd eyes</s>  that is the way i feel about it all the time justvisiting</s>  now it wouldnt be that way in boston i reckon</s> you couldnt keep on visiting there your whole life said march</s> dryfoos laughed showing his lower teeth in a way that was at oncesimple and fierce</s>  mr</s>  fulkerson didnt hardly know as he could getyou to leave</s>  i suppose you got used to it there</s>  i never been in yourcity</s> i had got used to it but it was hardly my city

great place said dryfoos</s>  i remembernow mr</s>  fulkerson told me you was from our state</s>  he went on to bragof the west as if march were an easterner and had to be convinced</s>  youought to see all that country</s>  its a great country</s> oh yes said march i understand that</s>  he expected the praise of thegreat west to lead up to some comment on every other week and therewas abundant suggestion of that topic in the manuscripts proofs ofletterpress and illustrations with advance copies of the latest numberstrewn over his table</s> but dryfoos apparently kept himself from looking at these things</s>  herolled his head about on his shoulders to take in the character of theroom and said to his son you didnt change the woodwork after all</s> no the architect thought we had better let it be unless we meant tochange the whole place</s>  he liked its being oldfashioned</s> i hope you feel comfortable here mr</s>  march the old man saidbringing his eyes to bear upon him again after their tour of inspection</s> too comfortable for a workingman said march and he thought thatthis remark must bring them to some talk about his work but theproprietor only smiled again</s> i guess i shant lose much on this house he returned as if musingaloud</s>  this downtown property is coming up</s>  business is getting inon all these side streets</s>  i thought i paid a pretty good price forit too</s>  he went on to talk of real estate and march began to feel acertain resentment at his continued avoidance of the only topic inwhich they could really have a common interest</s>  you live down this waysomewhere dont you</s>  the old man concluded</s> yes</s>  i wished to be near my work</s>  march was vexed with himself forhaving recurred to it but afterward he was not sure but dryfoos sharedhis own diffidence in the matter and was waiting for him to bring itopenly into the talk</s>  at times he seemed wary and masterful and thenmarch felt that he was being examined and tested at others so simplethat march might well have fancied that he needed encouragement anddesired it</s>  he talked of his wife and daughters in a way that invitedmarch to say friendly things of his family which appeared to give theold man first an undue pleasure and then a final distrust</s>  at moments heturned with an effect of finding relief in it to his son and spoke tohim across march of matters which he was unacquainted with he did notseem aware that this was rude but the young man must have felt itso he always brought the conversation back and once at some cost tohimself when his father made it personal</s> i want to make a regular new york business man out of that fellow hesaid to march pointing at conrad with his stick</s>  you spose im evergoing to do it</s> well i dont know said march trying to fall in with the joke</s>  doyou mean nothing but a business man</s> the old man laughed at whatever latent meaning he fancied in this andsaid you think he would be a little too much for me there</s>  well iveseen enough of em to know it dont always take a large pattern of a manto do a large business</s>  but i want him to get the business training andthen if he wants to go into something else he knows what the world isanyway</s>  heigh</s> oh yes</s>  march assented with some compassion for the young manreddening patiently under his fathers comment</s> dryfoos went on as if his son were not in hearing</s>  now that boy wantedto be a preacher</s>  what does a preacher know about the world he preachesagainst when hes been brought up a preacher</s>  he dont know so

to feel some compassion for himself in beingwitness of the young fellows discomfort under his fathers homily</s> when we first come to new york i told him now heres your chance tosee the world on a big scale</s>  you know already what work and saving andsteady habits and sense will bring a man to you dont want to go roundamong the rich you want to go among the poor and see what laziness anddrink

simplesmile and in his sharp eyes march fancied contempt of the ambitionhe had balked in his son</s>  the present scene must have been one of manybetween them ending in meek submission on the part of the young manwhom his father perhaps without realizing his cruelty treated asa child</s>  march took it hard that he should be made to suffer in thepresence of a coordinate power like himself and began to dislike theold man out of proportion to his offence which might have been merewant of taste or an effect of mere embarrassment before him</s>  butevidently whatever rebellion his daughters had carried through againsthim he had kept his dominion over this gentle spirit unbroken</s>  marchdid not choose to make any response but to let him continue if hewould entirely upon his own

all to you</s> ah im not so sure</s>  i dont believe a mans any better for having mademoney so easily and rapidly as dryfoos has done and i doubt if hes anywiser</s>  i dont know just the point hes reached in his evolution fromgrub to beetle but i do know that so far as its gone the process musthave involved a bewildering change of ideals and criterions</s>  i guesshes come to despise a great many things that he once respected andthat intellectual ability is among themwhat we call intellectualability</s>  he must have undergone a moral deterioration an atrophy of thegenerous instincts and

he may have thought he was using dryfoos when dryfoos was using himand he may have supposed he was not afraid of him when he was very muchso</s>  his courage hadnt been put to the test and courage is a matter ofproof like proficiency on the fiddle you know you cant tell whetheryouve got it till you try</s> nonsense</s>  do you mean that he would ever sacrifice you to mr</s>  dryfoos</s> i hope he

going to have youletting every little thing discourage you</s>  i dont see what there wasin mr</s>  dryfooss manner to give you any anxiety</s>  hes just a commonstupid inarticulate country person and he didnt know how to expresshimself as i said in the beginning and thats the reason he didnt sayanything</s> well i dont deny youre right about it</s> its dreadful his wife continued to be mixed up with such a man andhis family but i dont believe hell ever meddle with your managementand till he does all you need do is to have as little to do with himas possible and go quietly on your own way</s> oh i shall go on quietly enough said march</s>  i hope i shant begingoing stealthily</s> well my dear said mrs</s>  march just let me know when youre temptedto do that</s>  if ever you sacrifice the

not convictions said march</s> iii</s> that night dryfoos was wakened from his afterdinner nap by the sound ofgay talk and nervous giggling in the drawingroom</s>  the talk which waschristines and the giggling which was melas were intershot with theheavier tones of a mans voice and dryfoos lay awhile on the leathernlounge in his library trying to make out whether he knew the voice</s> his wife sat in a deep chair before the fire with her eyes on his facewaiting for him to wake</s> who is that out there</s>  he asked without opening his eyes</s> indeed indeed i dont know jacob his wife answered</s>  i reckon itsjust some visitor of the girls</s> was i snoring</s> not a bit</s>  you was sleeping as quiet</s>  i did hate to have em wake youand i was just goin out to shoo them</s>  theyve been playin somethingand that made them laugh</s> i didnt know but i had snored said the old man sitting up</s> no said his wife</s>  then she asked wistfully was you out at the oldplace jacob</s> yes</s> did it look natural</s> yes mostly</s>  theyre sinking the wells down in the woods pasture</s> andthe childrens graves</s> they havent touched that part</s>  but i reckon we got to have em movedto the cemetery</s>  i bought a lot</s> the old woman began softly to weep</s>  it does seem too hard that theycant be let to rest in peace pore little things</s>  i wanted you and meto lay there too when our time come jacob</s>  just there back o thebeehives and under them shoomakesmy i can see the very place</s>  and idont believe ill ever feel at home anywheres else</s>  i woont know wherei am when the trumpet sounds</s>  i have to think before i can tell wherethe east is in new york and what if i should git faced the wrong waywhen i raise</s>  jacob i wonder you could sell it</s>  her head shook andthe firelight shone on her tears as she searched the folds of her dressfor her pocket</s> a peal of laughter came from the drawingroom and then the sound ofchords struck on the piano</s> hush</s>  dont you cry lizbeth</s>  said dryfoos</s>  here take myhandkerchief</s>  ive got a nice lot in the cemetery and im goin to havea monument with two lambs on itlike the one you always liked so much</s> it aint the fashion any more to have family buryin grounds theyrecollectin em into the cemeteries all round</s> i reckon i got to bear it said his wife muffling her face in hishandkerchief</s>  and i suppose the lord kin find me wherever i am</s>  buti always did want to lay just there</s>  you mind how we used to go outand set there after milkin and watch the sun go down and talk aboutwhere their angels was and try to figger it out</s> i remember lizbeth</s> the mans voice in the drawingroom sang a snatch of french songinsolent mocking salient and then christines attempted the samestrain and another cry of laughter from mela followed</s> well i always did expect to lay there</s>  but i reckon its all right</s>  itwont be a great while now anyway</s>  jacob i dont believe im agointo live very long</s>  i know it dont agree with me here</s> oh i guess it does lizbeth</s>  youre just a little pulled down withthe weather</s>  its coming spring and you feel it but the doctor saysyoure all right</s>  i stopped in on the way up and he says so</s> i reckon he dont know everything the old woman persisted ive beenrunnin down ever since we left moffitt and i didnt feel any too wellthere even</s>  its a very strange thing jacob that the richer you gitthe less you aint able to stay where you want to dead or alive</s> its for the children we do it said dryfoos</s>  we got to give themtheir chance in the world</s> oh the world</s>  they ought to bear the yoke in their youth like wedone</s>  i know its what coonrod would like to do</s> dryfoos got upon his feet</s>  if coonrod ll mind his own business and dowhat i want him to hell have yoke enough to bear</s>  he moved from hiswife without further effort to comfort her and pottered heavily outinto the diningroom</s>  beyond its obscurity stretched the glitter ofthe deep drawingroom</s>  his feet in their broad flat slippers madeno sound on the dense carpet and he came unseen upon the little groupthere near the piano</s>  mela perched upon the stool with her back to thekeys and beaton bent over christine who sat with a banjo in herlap letting him take her hands and put them in the right place on theinstrument</s>  her face was radiant with happiness and mela was watchingher with foolish unselfish pleasure in her bliss</s> there was nothing wrong in the affair to a man of dryfooss traditionsand perceptions and if it had been at home in the farm sittingroomor even in his parlor at moffitt he would not have minded a young mansplacing his daughters hands on a banjo or even holding them there itwould have seemed a proper attention from him if he was courting her</s> but here in such a house as this with the daughter of a man who hadmade as much money as he had he did not know but it was a liberty</s> he felt the angry doubt of it which beset him in regard to so manyexperiences of his changed life he wanted to show his sense of it ifit was a liberty but he did not know how and he did not know thatit was so</s>  besides he could not help a touch of the pleasure inchristines happiness which mela showed and he would have gone back tothe library if he could without being discovered</s> but beaton had seen him and dryfoos with a nonchalant nod to the youngman came forward</s>  what you got there christine</s> a banjo said the girl blushing in her fathers presence</s> mela gurgled</s>  mr</s>  beaton is learnun her the first position</s> beaton was not embarrassed</s>  he was in evening dress and his facepointed with its brown beard showed extremely handsome above theexpanse of his broad white shirtfront</s>  he gave back as nonchalant anod as he had got and without further greeting to dryfoos he said tochristine no no</s>  you must keep your hand and arm so</s>  he held them inposition</s>  there</s>  now strike with your right hand</s>  see</s> i dont believe i can ever learn said the girl with a fond upwardlook at him</s> oh yes you can said beaton</s> they both ignored dryfoos in the little play of protests which followedand he said half jocosely half suspiciously and is the banjo thefashion now</s>  he remembered it as the emblem of lowdown show businessand associated it with endmen and blackened faces and grotesqueshirtcollars</s> its all the rage mela shouted in answer for all</s>  everybody playsit</s>  mr</s>  beaton borrowed this from a lady friend of his</s> humph</s>  pity i got you a piano then said dryfoos</s>  a banjo would havebeen cheaper</s> beaton so far admitted him to the conversation as to seem reminded ofthe piano by his mentioning it</s>  he said to mela oh wont you juststrike those chords</s>  and as mela wheeled about and beat the keys hetook the banjo from christine and sat down with it</s>  this way</s>  hestrummed it and murmured the tune dryfoos had heard him singing fromthe library while he kept his beautiful eyes floating on christines</s> you try that now its very simple</s> where is mrs</s>  mandel</s>  dryfoos demanded trying to assert himself</s> neither of the girls seemed to have heard him at first in the chatterthey broke into over what beaton proposed</s>  then mela said absentlyoh she had to go out to see one of her friends thats sick and shestruck the piano keys</s>  come try it chris</s> dryfoos turned about unheeded and went back to the library</s>  he wouldhave liked to put beaton out of his house and in his heart he burnedagainst him as a contumacious hand he would have liked to discharge himfrom the art department of every other week at once</s>  but he was awareof not having treated beaton with much ceremony and if the young manhad returned his behavior in kind with an electrical response to hisown feeling had he any right to complain</s>  after all there was no harmin his teaching christine the banjo</s> his wife still sat looking into the fire</s>  i cant see she said asweve got a bit more comfort of our lives jacob because weve got suchpiles and piles of money</s>  i wisht to gracious we was back on the farmthis minute</s>  i wisht you had held out aginst the childern about sellinit twould a bin the best thing fur em i say</s>  i believe in mysoul theyll git spoiled here in new york</s>  i kin see a change in emareadyin the girls</s> dryfoos stretched himself on the lounge again</s>  i cant see as coonrodis much comfort either</s>  why aint he here with his sisters</s>  what doesall that work of his on the east side amount to</s>  it seems as if he doneit to cross me as much as anything</s>  dryfoos complained to his wifeon the basis of mere affectional habit which in married life oftensurvives the sense of intellectual equality</s>  he did not expect her toreason with him but there was help in her listening and though shecould only soothe his fretfulness with soft answers which were oftenwide of the purpose he still went to her for solace</s>  here ive goneinto this newspaper business or whatever it is on his account andhe dont seem any more satisfied than ever</s>  i can see he haint got hisheart in it</s> the pore boy tries i know he does jacob and he wants to please you</s> but he give up a good deal when he give up bein a preacher i spose weought to remember that</s> a preacher</s>  sneered dryfoos</s>  i reckon bein a preacher wouldntsatisfy him now</s>  he had the impudence to tell me this afternoon that hewould like to be a priest and he threw it up to me that he never couldbe because id kept him from studyin</s> he dont mean a catholic priestnot a roman one jacob the old womanexplained wistfully</s>  hes told me all about it</s>  they aint the kindo catholics we been used to some sort of piscopalians and they do aheap o good amongst the poor folks over there</s>  he says we aint gotany idea how folks lives in them tenement houses hundreds of em in onehouse and whole families in a room and it burns in his heart to helpem like them fathers as he calls em that gives their lives to it</s>  hecant be a father he says because he cant git the eddication now buthe can be a brother and i cant find a word to say aginst it when itgits to talkin jacob</s> i aint saying anything against his priests lizbeth said dryfoos</s> theyre all well enough in their way theyve given up their lives toit and its a matter of business with them like any other</s>  but whatim talking about now is coonrod</s>  i dont object to his doin all thecharity he wants to and the lord knows ive never been stingy with himabout it</s>  he might have all the money he wants to give round any way

know what all you got togive yourself if you expect to help em</s>  thats what coonrod says</s> well i can tell him that charity begins at home said dryfoossitting up in his impatience</s>  and hed

factheightened his pleasure in christines liking for him</s>  he was as sure ofthis as he was of the other though he was not so sure of any reason forhis pleasure in it</s>  she had her charm the charm of wildness to whicha certain wildness in himself responded and there were times when hisfancy contrived a common future for them which would have a prosperityforced from the old fellows love of

enough in love with the girl to marry herwithout it that would be fine</s>  he was taken with her in a certainmeasure in a certain way the question was in what measure in whatway</s> it was partly to escape from this question that he hurried downtownand decided to spend with the leightons the hour remaining on his handsbefore it was time to go to the reception for which he was dressed</s>  itseemed to him important that he should see alma leighton</s>  after allit was her charm that was most abiding with him perhaps it was to befinal</s>  he found himself very happy in his present

mr</s>  fulkerson of every other week</s>  think ive metyou at our place</s>  the girls laughed and alma explained that her motherwas not very well and would be sorry not to see him</s>  then she turnedas he felt perversely and went on talking with fulkerson and left himto miss woodburn</s> she finally recognized his disappointment ah dont often get a chanceat you mr</s>  beaton and ahm just

more personal reasons than shehad implied it flattered him that she should have resented what he toldher of the dryfooses</s>  she had scolded him in their behalf apparentlybut really because he had made her jealous by his interest of whateverkind in some one else</s>  what followed had followed naturally</s>  unlessshe had been quite a simpleton she could not have met his provisionallovemaking on any other terms and the reason why beaton chiefly likedalma leighton was that she was not a simpleton</s>  even up in the countrywhen she was overawed by his acquaintance at first she was not verydeeply overawed and at times she was not overawed at all</s>  at such timesshe astonished him by taking his most solemn histrionics with flippantincredulity and even burlesquing them</s>  but he could see all the samethat he had caught her fancy and he admired the skill with which shepunished his neglect when they met in new york</s>  he had really come verynear forgetting the leightons the intangible obligations of mutualkindness which hold some men so fast hung loosely upon him it wouldnot have hurt him to break from them altogether but when he recognizedthem at last he found that it strengthened them indefinitely to havealma ignore them so completely</s>  if she had been sentimental or softlyreproachful that would have been the end he could not have stood ithe would have had to drop her</s>  but when she met him on his own groundand obliged him to be sentimental the game was in her hands</s>  beatonlaughed now when he thought of that and he said to himself that thegirl had grown immensely since she had come to new york nothing seemedto have been lost upon her she must have kept her eyes uncommonly wideopen</s>  he noticed that especially in their talks over her work she hadprofited by everything she had seen and heard she had all of wetmoresideas pat it amused beaton to see how she seized every useful word thathe dropped too and turned him to technical account whenever she could</s> he liked that she had a great deal of talent there was no questionof that if she were a man there could be no question of her future</s>  hebegan to construct a future for her

was always trying tofit everything with a phrase said it was the unfrequenters who werefashionable</s>  there was great ease there and simplicity and if therewas not distinction it was not for want of distinguished people butbecause there seems to be some solvent in new york life that reduces allmen to a common level that touches everybody with its potent magic andbrings to the surface the deeply

the drawingroom indiscriminating levellingbut doubtless finally wholesome and witnessing the immensity of theplace if not consenting to the grandeur of reputations or presences</s> beaton now denied that this house represented a salon at all in the oldsense and he held that the salon was impossible even undesirablewith us when miss vance sighed for it</s>  at any rate he said that thisturmoil of coming and going this bubble and babble this cackling andhissing of conversation was not the expression of any such civilizationas had created the salon</s>  here he owned were the elements ofintellectual delightfulness but he said their assemblage in suchquantity alone denied the salon there was too much of a good thing</s> the french word implied a long evening of general talk among the guestscrowned with a little chicken at supper ending at cockcrow</s>  here wastea with milk or with lemonbaths of it and claretcup for the hardierspirits throughout the evening</s>  it was very nice very pleasant butit was not the little chickennot the salon</s>  in fact he affirmed thesalon descended from above out of the great world and included theaesthetic world in it</s>  but our great worldthe rich people werestupid with no wish to be otherwise they were not even curious aboutauthors and artists</s>  beaton fancied himself speaking impartially and sohe allowed himself to speak bitterly he said that in no other city inthe world except vienna perhaps were such people so little a part ofsociety</s> it isnt altogether the rich peoples fault said margaret and shespoke impartially too</s>  i dont believe that the literary men and theartists would like a salon that descended to them</s>  madame geoffrin youknow was very plebeian her husband was a business man of some

ladies</s>  beaton echoed</s>  miss leighton andno i have been there with my aunts cards already</s> oh yes said beaton as if he had known of it he admired the pluckand pride with which alma had

was not a girl tocare much for the inferences that might be drawn from such conclusionsshe rather prided herself upon despising them and she gave herself tothe pleasure of being talked to as if she

theatre</s> mela whom she did not admit to her reasons or feelings always followedher with the servile admiration she had for all that christine didand she took on trust as somehow successful the

look which christine wore seemedto forbid provisionally at least any such recreation</s>  on her partchristine was cool with the marches</s>  it went through her mind that theymust have told miss

sheconjectured that he might have told miss vance of her acquaintancewith the marches and she bent forward and nodded to mrs</s>  march acrossconrad mela and mr</s>  march</s>  she conceived of him as

ought tofind in society</s>  she was not exacting but it seemed to her there werevery few young men and when the music was over and their opportunitycame to be sociable they were not very sociable</s>  they were notintroduced for one thing but it appeared to mela that they might havegot introduced if they had any sense she saw them looking at herand she was glad she had dressed so much she was dressed more than anyother lady there and either because she was the most dressed of anyperson there or because it had got around who her father was she feltthat she had made an impression on the young men</s>  in her satisfactionwith this and from her good nature she was contented to be served withher refreshments after the concert by mr</s>  march and to remain jokingwith him</s>  she was at her ease she let her hoarse voice out in herlargest laugh she accused him to the admiration of those nearof getting her into a perfect gale</s>  it appeared to her in her ownpleasure her mission to illustrate to the rather subdued people abouther what a good time really was so that they could have it if theywanted it</s>  her joy was crowned when march modestly professed himselfunworthy to monopolize her and explained how selfish he felt in talkingto a young lady when there were so many young men dying to do so</s> oh pshaw dyun yes</s>  cried mela tasting the irony</s>  i guess i seethem</s> he asked if he might really introduce a friend of his to her and shesaid well yes if he thought he could live to get to her and marchbrought up a man whom he thought very young and mela thought very old</s> he was a contributor to every other week and so march knew him hebelieved himself a student of human nature in behalf of literature andhe now set about studying mela</s>  he tempted her to express her opinion onall points and he laughed so amiably at the boldness and humorous vigorof her ideas that she was delighted with him</s>  she asked him if he wasa newyorker by birth and she told him she pitied him when he said hehad never been west</s>  she professed herself perfectly sick of new yorkand urged him to go to moffitt if he wanted to see a real live town</s>  hewondered if it would do to put her into literature just as she was withall her slang and brag but he decided that he would have to subdue hera great deal he did not see how he could reconcile the facts of herconversation with the facts of her appearance her beauty her splendorof dress her apparent right to be where she was</s>  these thingsperplexed him he was afraid the great american novel

said she would the first chance she got andshe added they would be much pleased to have him call</s>  she felt herselfto be having a beautiful time and she got directly upon such intimateterms with the student of human nature that she laughed with him aboutsome peculiarities of his such as his going so far about to ask thingshe wanted to know from her she said she never did believe in beatingabout the bush much</s>  she had noticed the same thing in miss vance whenshe came to call that day and when the young man owned that he camerather a good deal to mrs</s>  horns house she asked him well what sortof a girl was miss vance anyway and where did he suppose she had mether brother</s>  the student of human nature could not say as to this andas to miss vance he judged it safest to

too</s>  mela interrupted</s>  ill betanything thats where she met him</s>  i wisht i could tell christine</s>  but isuppose she would want to kill me if i was to speak to her now</s> the student of human nature said politely oh shall i take you toher</s> mela answered i guess you better not</s>  with a laugh so significantthat he could not help his inferences concerning both christinesabsorption in the person she was talking with and the habitual violenceof her temper</s>  he made note of how mela helplessly spoke of all herfamily by their names as if he were already intimate with them

mind andto whirl on a definite orbit in american society</s>  but he was puzzledto decide whether melas willingness to take him into her confidenceon short notice was typical or personal the trait of a daughter of thenaturalgas millionaire or a foible of her own</s> beaton talked with christine the greater part of the evening thatwas left after the concert</s>  he was very grave and took the tone of afatherly friend he spoke guardedly of the people present and moderatedthe severity of some of christines judgments of their looks andcostumes</s>  he did this out of a sort of unreasoned allegiance tomargaret whom he was in the mood of wishing to please by being verykind and good as she always was</s>  he had the sense also of atoningby this behavior for some reckless things he had said before that tochristine he put on a sad reproving air with her and gave her thefeeling of being held in check</s> she chafed at it and said glancing at margaret in talk with herbrother i dont

 i didnt suppose conrad ever went anywhere except totenementhouses</s> it might have been there becton suggested</s>  she goes among friendlesspeople everywhere</s> maybe thats the reason she came to see us</s>  said christine</s> becton looked at her with his smouldering eyes and felt the wish tosay yes it was exactly that but he only allowed himself to deny thepossibility of any such motive in that case</s>  he added i am so glad youknow her miss dryfoos</s>  i never met miss vance without feeling myselfbetter and truer somehow or the wish to be so</s> and you think we might be improved

been in such good company before but he could see that shewas not in the least affected by the experience</s>  he had told her whothis person and that was and he saw she had understood that the nameswere of consequence but she seemed to feel her equality with them all</s> her serenity was not obviously akin to the savage stoicism in whichbeaton hid his own consciousness of social inferiority

them could feel it as people ofmore worldly knowledge would and he consoled himself with the factthat fulkerson was really not such a charlatan as he seemed</s>  but itwent through his mind that this was a strange end for all dryfoossmoneymaking to come to and he philosophically accepted the fact of hisown humble fortunes when he reflected how little his money could buy forsuch a man</s>  it was an honorable use that fulkerson was putting it toin every other week it might be far more creditably spent on such anenterprise than on horses or wines or women the usual resources ofthe brute rich

with thelocal temperament</s>  the reason a new york man takes life so easily withall his rush is that his climate dont worry him</s>  but a boston man mustbe rasped the whole while by the edge in his air</s>  that accounts forhis sharpness and when hes lived through twentyfive or thirty bostonmays he gets to thinking that providence has some particular use forhim or he wouldnt have survived and that makes him conceited</s>  see</s> i see said march</s>  but i dont know how youre going to work thatidea into an advertisement exactly</s> oh pahaw now march</s>  you dont think ive got that on

novel</s>  our people like a bold strike and its goingto shake them up tremendously to have serfdom advocated on high moralgrounds as the only solution of the labor problem</s>  you see in the

hes converted you</s>  i swearfulkerson if we had accepted and paid for an article advocatingcannibalism as the only resource for getting rid of the superfluouspoor youd begin to believe in it</s>

resolve not to let any of his little peculiarities alienateher from a sense of his claim upon her sympathy and gratitude not onlyas a man who had been so generously fond of her husband in his youthbut a hero who had suffered for her country</s>  her theory was that hismutilation must not be ignored but must be kept in mind as a monumentof his sacrifice and she fortified bella with this conception

her a little faintshe was not without a bewildered resentment of its presence as a sortof oppression</s>  she did not like his drinking so much of marchs beereither it was no harm but it was somehow unworthy out of characterwith a hero of the war</s>  but what she really could not reconcileherself to was the violence of lindaus sentiments concerning the wholepolitical and social fabric</s>  she did not feel sure that he should beallowed to say such things before the children who had been nurtured inthe faith of bunker hill and appomattox as the beginning and the end ofall possible progress in human rights</s>  as a woman she was naturally anaristocrat but as an american she was theoretically a democrat andit astounded it alarmed her to hear american democracy denounced asa shuffling evasion</s>  she had never cared much for the united statessenate but she doubted if she ought to sit by when it was railed at asa rich mans club</s>  it shocked her to be told that the rich and poor werenot equal before the law in a country where justice must be paid for atevery step in fees and costs or where a poor man must go to war in hisown person and a rich man might hire someone to go in his</s>  mrs</s>  marchfelt that this rebellious mind in lindau really somehow outlawed himfrom sympathy and retroactively undid his past suffering for thecountry she had always particularly valued that provision of the lawbecause in forecasting all the possible mischances that might befall herown son she had been comforted by the thought that if there everwas another war and tom were drafted his father could buy him asubstitute</s>  compared with such blasphemy as this lindaus declarationthat there was not equality of opportunity in america and thatfully onehalf the people were debarred their right to the pursuit ofhappiness by the hopeless conditions of their lives was flatteringpraise</s>  she could not listen to such things in silence though andit did not help matters when lindau

not be of the firstexcellence they may be a little stale and small and poor to beginwith but they are still olives and the fond palate craves them</s>  thesort which grew in new york on lower sixth avenue and in the region ofjefferson market and on the soft exposures south of washington squarewere none the less acceptable because they were of the commonest italianvariety</s> the marches spent a good deal of time and money in a grocery ofthat nationality where they found all the patriotic comestibles andpotables and renewed their faded italian with the friendly family incharge</s>  italian table dhotes formed the adventure of the week on theday when mrs</s>  march let her domestics go out and went herself to dineabroad with her husband and children and they became adepts in therestaurants where they were served and which they varied almostfrom dinner to dinner</s>  the perfect decorum of these places and theirimmunity from offence in any emboldened the marches to experimentin spanish restaurants where red pepper and beans insisted in everydinner and where once they chanced upon a night of olla podrida withsuch appeals to marchs memory of a boyish ambition to taste the dishthat he became poetic and then pensive over its cabbage and carrotspeas and bacon</s>  for a rare combination of international motives theyprized most the table dhote of a french lady who had taken a spanishhusband in a second marriage and had a cuban negro for her cook witha crosseyed alsation for waiter and a slim young southamerican forcashier</s>  march held that some thing of the catholic character of theserelations expressed itself in the generous and tolerant variety of thedinner which was singularly abundant for fifty cents without wine</s>  atone very neat french place he got a dinner at the same price with winebut it was not so abundant and march inquired in fruitless speculationwhy the table dhote of the italians a notoriously frugal andabstemious people should be usually more than you wanted atseventyfive cents and a dollar and that of the french rather lessat half a dollar</s>  he could not see that the frequenters were greatlydifferent at the different places they were mostly americans ofsubdued manners and conjecturably subdued fortunes with here and therea table full of foreigners</s>  there was no noise and not much smokinganywhere march liked going to that neat french place because theremadame sat enthroned and high behind a comptoir at one side of theroom and every body saluted her in going out</s>  it was there that agentlelooking young

theleaves and they looked round and found the infants and dotards gone andthe benches filled with lovers</s>  that was the signal for the marchesto go home</s>  he said that the spectacle of so much courtship as the eyemight take in there at a glance was not perhaps oppressive but thethought that at the same hour the same thing was going on all over thecountry wherever two young fools could get together was more thanhe could bear he did not deny that it was natural and in ameasureuthorized but he declared that it was hackneyed and the factthat it must go on forever as long as the race lasted

evening fulkerson came round to marchs to say that he had gotlindaus address from conrad and had looked him up at his lodgings</s> well there isnt so much bricabrac there quite as mrs</s>  green leftyou but ive made it all right with lindau as far as im concerned</s> i told him i didnt know when i spoke that way and i honored him forsticking to his brinciples i dont believe in his brincibles

anything to woundme</s>  i tell you it was an affecting scene march and rats enough roundin that old barracks where he lives to fit out a firstclass case ofdelirium tremens</s>  what does he stay there for</s>  hes not obliged to</s> lindaus reasons as march repeated them affected fulkerson asdeliciously comical but after that he confined his pleasantries at theoffice to beaton and conrad dryfoos or as he said he spent the restof the summer in keeping lindau smoothed up</s> it is doubtful if lindau altogether liked this as well</s>  perhaps hemissed the occasions fulkerson used to give him of bursting out againstthe millionaires and he could not well go on denouncing as the slafeof gabidal a man who had behaved to him as fulkerson had done thoughfulkersons servile relations to capital had been in nowise changed byhis nople gonduct</s> their relations continued to wear this irksome character of mutualforbearance and when dryfoos returned in october and fulkerson revivedthe question of that dinner in celebration of the success of everyother week he carried his complaisance to an extreme that alarmedmarch for the consequences</s> v</s> you see fulkerson explained i find that the old man has got an ideaof his own about that banquet and i guess theres some sense in it</s>  hewants to have a preliminary little dinner where we can talk the thingup firsthalf a dozen of us and he wants to give us the dinner at hishouse</s>  well thats no harm</s>  i dont believe the old man ever gave adinner and hed like to show off a little theres a good deal of humannature in the old man after all</s>  he thought of you of course andcolonel woodburn and beaton and me at the foot of the table andconrad and i suggested kendricks hes such a nice little chap andthe old man himself brought up the idea of lindau</s>  he said you told himsomething about him and he asked why couldnt we have him too and ijumped at it</s> have lindau to dinner</s>  asked march</s> certainly why not</s>  father dryfoos has a notion of paying the oldfellow a compliment for what he done for the country</s>  there wont be anytrouble about it</s>  you can sit alongside of him and cut up his meat forhim and help him to thingsyes but it wont do fulkerson</s>  i dont believe lindau ever had on adresscoat in his life and i dont believe his brincibles would lethim wear one</s> well neither had dryfoos for the matter of that</s>  hes ashighprincipled as old panelectric himself when it comes to adresscoat said fulkerson</s>  were all going to go in business dressthe old man stipulated for that</s> it isnt the dresscoat alone march resumed</s>  lindau and dryfooswouldnt get on</s>  you know theyre opposite poles in everything</s>  youmustnt do it</s>  dryfoos will be sure to say something to outrage lindausbrincibles and therell be an explosion</s>  its all well enough fordryfoos to feel grateful to lindau and his wish to honor him does himcredit but to have lindau to dinner isnt the way</s>  at the best theold fellow would be very unhappy in such a house he would have abad conscience and i should be sorry to have him feel that hed beenrecreant to his brincibles theyre about all hes got and whateverwe think of them were bound to respect his fidelity to them</s>  marchwarmed toward lindau in taking this view of him</s>  i should feel ashamedif i didnt protest against his being put in a false position</s>  afterall hes my old friend and i shouldnt like to have him do himselfinjustice if he is a crank</s> of course said fulkerson with some trouble in his face</s>  iappreciate your feeling</s>  but there aint any danger he addedbuoyantly</s>  anyhow you spoke too late as the irishman said to thechicken when he swallowed him in a fresh egg</s>  ive asked lindau andhes accepted with blayzure thats what he says</s> march made no other comment than a shrug</s> youll see fulkerson continued it ll go off all right</s>  ill engageto make it and i wont hold anybody else responsible</s> in the course of his married life march had learned not to censure theirretrievable but this was just what his wife had not learned and shepoured out so much astonishment at what fulkerson had done and so muchdisapproval that march began to palliate the situation a little</s> after all it isnt a question of life and death and if it were idont see how its to be helped now</s> oh its not to be helped now</s>  but i am surprised at mr</s>  fulkerson</s> well fulkerson has his moments of being merely human too</s> mrs</s>  march would not deign a direct defence of her favorite</s>  well imglad there are not to be ladies</s> i dont know</s>  dryfoos thought of having ladies but it seems yourinfallible fulkerson overruled him</s>  their presence might have keptlindau and our host in bounds</s> it had become part of the marches conjugal joke for him to pretend thatshe could allow nothing wrong in fulkerson and he now laughed with amocking air of having expected it when she said well then if mr</s> fulkerson says he will see that it all comes out right i suppose youmust trust his tact</s>  i wouldnt trust yours basil</s>  the first wrong stepwas taken when mr</s>  lindau was asked to help on the magazine</s> well it was your infallible fulkerson that took the step or at leastsuggested it</s>  im happy to say i had totally forgotten my early friend</s> mrs</s>  march was daunted and silenced for a moment</s>  then she said ohpshaw</s>  you know well enough he did it to please you</s> im very glad he didnt do it to please you isabel said her husbandwith affected seriousness</s>  though perhaps he did</s> he began to look at the humorous aspect of the affair which itcertainly had and to comment on the singular incongruities which everyother week was destined to involve at every moment of its career</s>  iwonder if im mistaken in supposing that no other periodical was everlike it</s>  perhaps all periodicals are like it</s>  but i dont believetheres another publication in new york that could bring together inhonor of itself a fraternity and equality crank like poor old lindauand a belated sociological crank like woodburn and a truculentspeculator like old dryfoos and a humanitarian dreamer like youngdryfoos and a sentimentalist like me and a nondescript like beatonand a pure advertising essence like fulkerson and a society spirit likekendricks</s>  if we could only allow one another to talk uninterruptedlyall the time the dinner would be the greatest success in the world andwe should come home full of the highest mutual respect</s>  but i suspect wecant manage thateven your infallible fulkerson couldnt work itandim afraid that therell be some listening that ll spoil the pleasureof the time</s> march was so well pleased with this view of the case that he suggestedthe idea involved to fulkerson</s>  fulkerson was too good a fellow not tolaugh at another mans joke but he laughed a little ruefully and heseemed worn with more than one kind of care in the interval that passedbetween the present time and the night of the dinner</s> dryfoos necessarily depended upon him for advice concerning the scopeand nature of the dinner but he received the advice suspiciouslyand contested points of obvious propriety with pertinacious stupidity</s> fulkerson said that when it came to the point he would rather have hadthe thing as he called it at delmonicos or some other restaurant butwhen he found that dryfooss pride was bound up in having it at his ownhouse he gave way to him</s>  dryfoos also wanted his womancook to preparethe dinner but fulkerson persuaded him that this would not do he musthave it from a caterer</s>  then dryfoos wanted his maids to wait at tablebut fulkerson convinced him that this would be incongruous at amans dinner</s>  it was decided that the dinner should be sent in fromfrescobaldis and dryfoos went with fulkerson to discuss it with thecaterer</s>  he insisted upon having everything explained to him andthe reason for having it and not something else in its place and hetreated fulkerson and frescobaldi as if they were in league toimpose upon him</s>  there were moments when fulkerson saw the varnish ofprofessional politeness cracking on the neapolitans volcanic surfaceand caught a glimpse of the lava fires of the cooks nature beneathhe trembled for dryfoos who was walking roughshod over him in thesecurity of an american who had known how to make his money and mustknow how to spend it but he got him safely away at last and gavefrescobaldi a wink of sympathy for his shrug of exhaustion as theyturned to leave him</s> it was at first a relief and then an anxiety with fulkerson that lindaudid not come about after accepting the invitation to dinner until heappeared at dryfooss house prompt to the hour</s>  there was to be surenothing to bring him but fulkerson was uneasily aware that dryfoosexpected to meet him at the office and perhaps receive some verbalacknowledgment of the honor done him</s>  dryfoos he could see thoughthe was doing all his invited guests a favor and while he stood in acertain awe of them as people of much greater social experience thanhimself regarded them with a kind of contempt as people who were goingto have a better dinner at his house than they could ever afford to haveat their own</s>  he had finally not spared expense upon it after pushingfrescobaldi to the point of eruption with his misgivings and suspicionsat the first interview he had gone to him a second time alone and toldhim not to let the money stand between him and anything he would liketo do</s>  in the absence of frescobaldis fellowconspirator he restoredhimself in the caterers esteem by adding whatever he suggested andfulkerson after trembling for the old mans niggardliness was nowafraid of a fantastic profusion in the feast</s>  dryfoos had reduced thescale of the banquet as regarded the number of guests but a confusingremembrance of what fulkerson had wished to do remained with him inpart and up to the day of the dinner he dropped in at frescobaldisand ordered more dishes and more of them</s>  he impressed the italian asan american original of a novel kind and when he asked fulkerson howdryfoos had made his money and learned that it was primarily in naturalgas he made note of some of his eccentric tastes as peculiarities thatwere to be caressed in any future naturalgas millionaire who mightfall into his hands</s>  he did not begrudge the time he had to givein explaining to dryfoos the relation of the different wines to thedifferent dishes dryfoos was apt to substitute a costlier wine where hecould for a cheaper one and he gave frescobaldi carte blanche for thedecoration of the table with pieces of artistic confectionery</s>  amongthese the caterer designed one for a surprise to his patron and adelicate recognition of the source of his wealth which he found dryfoosvery willing to talk about when he intimated that he knew what it was</s> dryfoos left it to fulkerson to invite the guests and he found readyacceptance of his politeness from kendricks who rightly regarded thedinner as a part of the every other week business and was too sweetand kindhearted anyway not to seem very glad to come</s>  march wasa matter of course but in colonel woodburn fulkerson encountered areluctance which embarrassed him the more because he was conscious ofhaving for motives of his own rather strained a point in suggestingthe colonel to dryfoos as a fit subject for invitation</s>  there had beenonly one of the colonels articles printed as yet and though it hadmade a sensation in its way and started the talk about that numberstill it did not fairly constitute him a member of the staff or evenentitle him to recognition as a regular contributor</s>  fulkerson felt sosure of pleasing him with dryfooss message that he delivered it in fullfamily council at the widows</s>  his daughter received it with all theenthusiasm that fulkerson had hoped for but the colonel said stifflyi have not the pleasure of knowing mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  miss woodburn appearedready to fall upon him at this but controlled herself as if aware thatfilial authority had its limits and pressed her lips together withoutsaying anything</s> yes i know fulkerson admitted</s>  but it isnt a usual case</s>  mr</s> dryfoos dont go in much for the conventionalities i reckon he dontknow much about em come to boil it down and he hopedhere fulkersonfelt the necessity of inventing a littlethat you would excuse anywant of ceremony its to be such an informal affair anyway were allgoing in business dress and there aint going to be any ladies</s>  hedhave come himself to ask you but hes a kind of a bashful old fellow</s> its all right colonel woodburn</s> i take it that it is sir said the colonel courteously but withunabated state coming from you</s>  but in these matters we have no rightto burden our friends with our decisions</s> of course of course said fulkerson feeling that he had beendelicately told to mind his own business</s> i understand the colonel went on the relation that mr</s>  dryfoosbears to the periodical in which you have done me the honor to print mypapah but this is a question of passing the bounds of a purely businessconnection and of eating the salt of a man whom you do not definitelyknow to be a gentleman</s> mah goodness</s>  his daughter broke in</s>  if you bah your own salt withhis moneyit is supposed that i earn his money before i buy my salt with itreturned her father severely</s>  and in these times when money is gotin heaps through the natural decay of our nefarious commercialism itbehooves a gentleman to be scrupulous that the hospitality offered himis not the profusion of a thief with his booty</s>  i dont say that mr</s> dryfooss goodfortune is not honest</s>  i simply say that i know nothingabout it and that i should prefer to know something before i sat downat his board</s> youre all right colonel said fulkerson and so is mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  igive you my word that there are no flies on his personal integrity ifthats what you mean</s>  hes hard and hed push an advantage but i dontbelieve he would take an unfair one</s>  hes speculated and made moneyevery time but i never heard of his wrecking a railroad or belongingto any swindling company or any grinding monopoly</s>  he does chance itin stocks but hes always played on the square if you call stocksgambling</s> may i think this over till morning</s>  asked the colonel</s> oh certainly certainly said fulkerson eagerly</s>  i dont know astheres any hurry</s> miss woodburn found a chance to murmur to him before he went hellcome</s>  and ahm so much oblahged mr</s>  fulkerson</s>  ah jost know its allyou doing and it will give papa a chance to toak to some new peopleand get away from us evahlastin women for once</s> i dont see why any one should want to do that said fulkerson withgrateful gallantry</s>  but ill be dogged he said to march when hetold him about this odd experience if i ever expected to find colonelwoodburn on old lindaus ground</s>  he did come round handsomely thismorning at breakfast and apologized for taking time to think theinvitation over before he accepted</s>  you understand he says thatif it had been to the table of some friend not so prosperous as mr</s> dryfoosyour friend mr</s>  march for instanceit would have beensufficient to know that he was your friend</s>  but in these days it is aduty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to knowa rich man or not</s>  the chances of making money disreputably are so greatthat the chances are against a man who has made money if hes made agreat deal of it</s> march listened with a face of ironical insinuation</s>  that was very goodand he seems to have had a good deal of confidence in your patience andin your sense of his importance to the occasionno no fulkerson protested theres none of that kind of thingabout the colonel</s>  i told him to take time to think it over hes thesimplesthearted old fellow in the world</s> i should say so</s>  after all he didnt give any reason he had foraccepting</s>  but perhaps the young lady had the reason</s> pshaw march</s>  said fulkerson</s> vi</s> so far as the dryfoos family was concerned the dinner might as wellhave been given at frescobaldis rooms</s>  none of the ladies appeared</s> mrs</s>  dryfoos was glad to escape to her own chamber where she sat beforean autumnal fire shaking

colonel woodburnawaiting the moment when he could sally out on his hobby kept himselfintrenched within the dignity of a gentleman and examined askance thefigure of old lindau as he stared about the room with his fine head upand his empty sleeve dangling over his wrist</s>  march felt obliged to himfor wearing a new coat in the midst of that hostile luxury and he wasglad to see dryfoos make up to him and begin to talk with him as if hewished to show him particular respect though it might have been becausehe was less afraid of him than of the others</s>  he heard lindau sayingboat the name is choarman</s>  and dryfoos beginning to explain hispennsylvania dutch origin and he suffered himself with a sigh ofrelief to fall into talk with kendricks who was always pleasant hewas willing to talk about something besides himself and had no opinionsthat he was not ready to hold in abeyance for the time being out ofkindness to others</s>  in that group of impassioned individualities marchfelt him a refuge and comfortwith his harmless dilettante intention ofsome day writing a novel and his belief that he was meantime collectingmaterial for it</s> fulkerson while breaking the ice for the whole company was mainlyengaged in keeping colonel woodburn thawed out</s>  he took kendricksaway from march and presented him to the colonel as a person wholike himself was looking into social conditions he put one hand onkendrickss shoulder and one on the colonels and made some flatteringjoke apparently at the expense of the young fellow and then left them</s> march heard kendricks protest in vain and the colonel say gravely ido not wonder sir that these things interest you</s>  they constitute aproblem which society must solve or which will dissolve society and heknew from that formula which the colonel had once used with him thathe was laying out a road for the exhibition of the hobbys paces later</s> fulkerson came back to march who had turned toward conrad dryfoos andsaid if we dont

incharacterizing some of the motives that led men to the cannons mouth asno higher than business motives and his comparison is the most forciblethat he could have used</s>  i was very much struck by it</s> the hobby was out the colonel was in the saddle with so firm a seatthat no effort sufficed to dislodge him</s>  the dinner went on from courseto course with barbaric profusion and from time to time fulkerson triedto bring the talk back to every other week</s>  but perhaps because thatwas only the ostensible and not the real object of the dinner which wasto bring a number of men together under dryfooss roof and make themthe witnesses of his splendor make them feel the power of his wealthfulkersons attempts failed</s>  the colonel showed how commercialism wasthe poison at the heart of our national life how we began as a simpleagricultural people who had fled to these shores with the instinctdivinely implanted of building a state such as the sun never shone uponbefore how we had conquered the wilderness and the savage how we hadflung off in our struggle with the mothercountry the trammels oftradition and precedent and had settled down a free nation to thepractice of the arts of peace how the spirit of commercialism hadstolen insidiously upon us and the infernal impulse of competition hadembroiled us in a perpetual warfare of interests developing the worstpassions of our nature and teaching us to trick and betray and destroyone another in the strife for money till now that impulse had exhausteditself and we found competition gone and the whole economic problem inthe hands of monopoliesthe standard oil company the sugar trust therubber trust and what not</s>  and now what was the next thing</s>  affairscould not remain as they were it was impossible and what was the nextthing</s> the company listened for the main part silently</s>  dryfoos tried to graspthe idea of commercialism as the colonel seemed to hold it he conceivedof it as something like the drygoods business on a vast scale andhe knew he had never been in that</s>  he did not like to hear competitioncalled infernal he had always supposed it was something sacred but heapproved of what colonel woodburn said of the standard oil company itwas all true the standard oil has squeezed dryfoos once and made himsell it a lot of oilwells by putting down the price of oil so low inthat region that he lost money on every barrel he pumped</s> all the rest listened silently except lindau at every point thecolonel made against the present condition of things he said more andmore fiercely you are righdt you are righdt</s>  his eyes glowed hishand played with his knifehilt</s>  when the colonel demanded and what isthe next thing</s>  he threw himself forward and repeated yes sir</s>  whatis the next thing</s> natural gas by thunder</s>  shouted fulkerson</s> one of the waiters had profited by lindaus posture to lean over himand put down in the middle of the table a structure in white

at the thing while heexplained the work of sinking a gaswell as he had already explainedit to frescobaldi</s>  in the midst of his lecture he caught sight of thecaterer himself where he stood in the pantry doorway smiling with anartists anxiety for the effect of his masterpiece</s> come in come in frescobaldi</s>  we want to congratulate you fulkersoncalled to him</s>  here gentlemen</s>  heres frescobaldis health</s> they all drank and frescobaldi smiling brilliantly and rubbing hishands as he bowed right and left permitted himself to say to dryfoosyou are please no</s>  you like</s> firstrate firstrate</s>  said the old man but when the italian hadbowed himself out and his guests had sunk into their seats again hesaid dryly to fulkerson i reckon they didnt have to torpedo thatwell or the derrick wouldnt look quite so nice and clean</s> yes fulkerson answered and that aint quite the stylethat littlewigglywaggly blue flamethat the gas acts when you touch off a goodvein of it</s>  this might do for weak gas and he went on to explainthey call it weak gas when they tap it two or three hundred feet downand anybody can sink a well in his back yard and get enough gas to lightand heat his house</s>  i remember one fellow that had it blazing up from apipe through a flowerbed just like a jet of water from a fountain</s>  mymy my</s>  you felyou gentlemenought to go out and see that countryall of you</s>  wish we could torpedo this well mr</s>  dryfoos and let emsee how it works</s>  mind that one you torpedoed for me</s>  you know whenthey sink a well he went on to the company they cant always mostgenerally sometimes tell whether theyre goin to get gas or oil orsalt water</s>  why when they first began to bore for salt water out on thekanawha back about the beginning of the century they used to getgas now and then and then they considered it a failure they called agaswell a blower and give it up in disgust the time wasnt ripe forgas yet</s>  now they bore away sometimes till they get halfway to chinaand dont seem to strike anything worth speaking of</s>  then they put adynamite torpedo down in the well and explode it</s>  they have a littlebar of iron that they call a godevil and they just drop it down on thebusiness end of the torpedo and then stand from under if you please</s> you hear a noise and in about half a minute you begin to see one

honored hostmeant</s>  generally get some visiting lady when theres one round todrop the godevil</s>  but that day we had to put up with conrad here</s>  theyoffered to let me drop it but i declined</s>  i told em i hadnt muchpractice with godevils in the newspaper syndicate business and iwasnt very well myself anyway</s>  astonishing fulkerson continued withthe air of relieving his explanation by an anecdote how reckless theyget using dynamite when theyre torpedoing wells</s>  we stopped at oneplace where a fellow was handling the cartridges pretty freely and mr</s> dryfoos happened to caution him a little and that ass came up with oneof em in his hand and began to pound it on the buggywheel to show ushow safe it was</s>  i turned green i was so scared but mr</s>  dryfoos kepthis color and kind of coaxed the fellow till he quit</s>  you could see hewas the fool kind that if you tried to stop him hed keep on hammeringthat cartridge just to show that it wouldnt explode till he blew youinto kingdom come</s>  when we got him to go away mr</s>  dryfoos drove up tohis foreman</s>  pay sheney off and discharge him on the spot says he</s> hes too safe a man to have round he knows too much about dynamite</s>  inever saw anybody so cool</s> dryfoos modestly dropped his head under fulkersons flattery andwithout lifting it turned his eyes toward colonel

 it happened to be when mr</s>  fulkerson was out there</s>  some ofthe men tried to form a unionno no</s>  cried fulkerson</s>  let me tell that</s>  i know you wouldnt doyourself justice mr</s>  dryfoos and i want em to know how a strike canbe managed if you take it in time</s>  you see some of those fellows gota notion that there ought to be a union among the workingmen to keep upwages and dictate to the employers and mr</s>  dryfooss foreman was theringleader in the business</s>  they understood pretty well that as soon ashe found it out that foreman would walk the plank and so they watchedout till they thought they had mr</s>  dryfoos just where they wantedhimeverything on the keen jump and every man worth his weight indiamondsand then they came to him andtold him to sign a promise tokeep that foreman to the end of the season or till he was through withthe work on the dryfoos and hendry addition under penalty of havingthem all knock off</s>  mr</s>  dryfoos smelled a mouse but he couldnt tellwhere the mouse was he saw that they did have him and he signed ofcourse</s>  there wasnt anything really against the fellow anyway he wasa firstrate man and he did his duty every time only hed got some ofthose ideas into his head and they turned it</s>  mr</s>  dryfoos signed andthen he laid low</s> march saw lindau listening with a mounting intensity and heard himmurmur in german shameful</s>  shameful</s> fulkerson went on well it wasnt long before they began to show theirhand but mr</s>  dryfoos kept dark</s>  he agreed to everything there neverwas such an obliging capitalist before there wasnt a thing they askedof him that he didnt do with the greatest of pleasure and all wentmerry as a marriagebell till one morning a whole gang of fresh menmarched into the dryfoos and hendry addition under the escort of adozen pinkertons with repeating rifles at halfcock and about fiftyfellows found themselves out of a job</s>  you never saw such a mad set</s> pretty neat said kendricks who looked at the affair purely from anaesthetic point of view</s>  such a coup as that would tell tremendously ina play</s> that was vile treason said lindau in german to march</s>  hes aninfamous traitor</s>  i cannot stay here</s>  i must go</s> he struggled to rise while march held him by the coat and imploredhim under his voice for heavens sake dont lindau</s>  you owe it toyourself not to make a scene if you come here</s>  something in it allaffected him comically he could not help laughing</s> the others were discussing the matter and seemed not to have

they had attemptedviolence of course they could have been shot</s>  but there was no fearof that</s>  those fellows can always be depended upon to cut one anothersthroats in the long run</s> but sometimes said colonel woodburn who had been watchingthroughout for a chance to mount his hobby again they make a gooddeal of trouble first</s>  how was it in the great railroad strike of 77</s> well i guess there was a little trouble that time colonel saidfulkerson</s>  but the men that undertake to override the laws and paralyzethe industries of a country like this generally get left in the end</s> yes sir generally and up to a certain point always</s>  but its theexceptional that is apt to happen as well as the unexpected</s>  and alittle reflection will convince any gentleman here that

dismissed himself with a haughty bow to the companycolonel woodburn shook hands elaborately all round when he had smokedhis cigar the others followed him</s>  it seemed to march that his owngoodnight from dryfoos was dry and cold</s> vii</s> march met fulkerson on the steps of the office next morning when hearrived rather later than his wont</s>  fulkerson did not show any ofthe signs of suffering

about the cover of the christmasnumber</s>  i think we ought to try it in three or four colors if we aregoing to observe the day at all</s>  he was off before march could pullhimself together to ask what dryfoos wanted at the office at that hourof the morning he always came in the afternoon on his way uptown</s> the fact of his presence renewed the sinister misgivings with whichmarch had parted from him the night before but fulkersons cheerfulnessseemed to gainsay them afterward march did not know whether toattribute this mood to the slipperiness that he was aware of at times infulkerson or to a cynical amusement he might have felt at leaving himalone to the old man who mounted to his room shortly after march hadreached it</s> a sort of dumb anger showed itself in his face his jaw was set sofirmly that he did not seem able at once to open it</s>  he asked withoutthe ceremonies of greeting what does that onearmed dutchman do onthis book</s> what does he do</s>  march echoed as people are apt to do with a questionthat is mandatory and offensive</s> yes sir what does he do</s>  does he write for it</s> i suppose you mean lindau said march</s>
 he saw no reason for refusingto answer dryfooss demand and he decided to ignore its terms</s>  no hedoesnt write for it in the usual way</s>  he translates for it he examinesthe foreign magazines and draws my attention to anything he thinks ofinterest</s>  but i told you about this beforei know what you told me well enough</s>  and i know what he is</s>  he is aredmouthed labor agitator</s>  hes one of those foreigners that come herefrom places where theyve never had a decent meals victuals in theirlives and as soon as they get their stomachs full they begin to maketrouble between our people

back if they dont like it over here</s>  they want to ruin thecountry</s> march could not help smiling a little at the words which came fastenough now in the hoarse staccato of dryfooss passion</s>  i dont knowwhom you mean by they generally speaking but i had the impressionthat poor old lindau had once done his best to save the country</s>  i dontalways like his way of talking but i know that he is one of the truestand kindest souls in the world and he is no more an atheist than i am</s> he is my friend and i cant allow him to be misunderstood</s> i dont care what he is dryfoos broke out i wont have him round</s> he cant have any more work from this office</s>  i want you to stop it</s>  iwant you to turn him off</s> march was standing at his desk as he had risen to receive dryfoos

nobody but mr</s>  fulkerson has anyright to talk with me about its management</s> dryfoos glared at him for a moment and demanded threateningly thenyou say you wont turn that old loafer off</s>  you say that i have gotto keep on paying my money out to buy beer for a man that would cut mythroat if he got the chance</s> i say nothing at all mr</s>  dryfoos march answered</s>  the blood came intohis face and he added but i will say that if you speak again of mr</s> lindau in those terms one of us must leave this room</s>  i will not hearyou</s> dryfoos looked at him with astonishment then he struck his hat down onhis head and stamped out of the room and down the stairs and a vaguepity came into marchs heart that was not altogether for himself</s>  hemight be the greater sufferer in the end but he was sorry to have gotthe better of that old man for the moment and he felt ashamed of theanger into which dryfooss anger had surprised him</s>  he knew he could notsay too much in defence of lindaus generosity and unselfishness and hehad not attempted to defend him as a political economist</s>  he could nothave taken any ground in relation to dryfoos but that which he held andhe felt satisfied that he was right in refusing to receive instructionsor commands from him</s>  yet somehow he was not satisfied with the wholeaffair and not merely because his present triumph threatened his finaladvantage but because he felt that in his heat he had hardly donejustice to dryfooss rights in the matter it did not quite console himto reflect that dryfoos had himself made it impossible</s>  he wastempted to go home and tell his wife what had happened and begin hispreparations for the future at once</s>  but he resisted this weaknessand kept mechanically about his work opening the letters and themanuscripts before him with that curious double action of the mindcommon in men of vivid imaginations</s>  it was a relief when conraddryfoos having apparently waited to make sure that his father wouldnot return came up from the countingroom and looked in on march with atroubled face</s> mr</s>  march he began i hope father hasnt been saying anything to youthat you cant overlook</s>  i know he was very much excited and when he isexcited he is apt to say things that he is sorry for</s> the apologetic attitude taken for dryfoos so different from anyattitude the peremptory old man would have conceivably taken forhimself made march smile</s>  oh no</s>  i fancy the boot is on the other leg</s> i suspect ive said some things your father cant overlook conrad</s> he called the young man by his christian name partly to distinguish himfrom his father partly from the infection of fulkersons habit andpartly from a kindness for him that seemed naturally to express itselfin that way</s> i know he didnt sleep last night after you all went away conradpursued and of course that made him more irritable and he was tried agood deal by some of the things that mr</s>  lindau said</s> i was tried a good deal myself said march</s>  lindau ought never tohave been there</s> no</s>  conrad seemed only partially to assent</s> i told mr</s>  fulkerson so</s>  i warned him that lindau would be apt tobreak out in some way</s>  it wasnt just to him and it wasnt just to yourfather to ask him</s> mr</s>  fulkerson had a good motive conrad gently urged</s>  he did itbecause he hurt his feelings that day about the pension</s> yes but it was a mistake</s>  he knew that lindau was inflexible about hisprinciples as he calls them and that one of his first principles isto denounce the rich in season and out of season</s>  i dont remember justwhat he said last night and i really thought id kept him frombreaking out in the most offensive way</s>  but your father seems very muchincensed</s> yes i know said conrad</s> of course i dont agree with lindau</s>  i think there are as many goodkind just people among the rich as there are among the poor and thatthey are as generous and helpful</s>  but lindau has got hold of one ofthose partial truths that hurt worse than the whole truth andpartial truth</s>  the young man interrupted</s>  didnt the saviour himselfsay how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom ofgod</s> why bless my soul</s>  cried march</s>  do you agree with lindau</s> i agree with the lord jesus christ said the young man solemnly anda strange light of fanaticism of exaltation came into his wide blueeyes</s>  and i believe he meant the kingdom of heaven upon this earth aswell as in the skies</s> march threw himself back in his chair and looked at him with a kind ofstupefaction in which his eye wandered to the doorway where he sawfulkerson standing it seemed to him a long time before he heard himsaying hello hello</s>  whats the row</s>  conrad pitching into you on oldlindaus account too</s> the young man turned and after a glance at fulkersons light smilingface went out as if in his present mood he could not bear the contactof that persiflant spirit</s> march felt himself getting provisionally very angry again</s>  excuse mefulkerson but did you know when you went out what mr</s>  dryfoos wanted tosee me for</s> well no i didnt exactly said fulkerson taking his usual seat on achair and looking over the back of it at march</s>  i saw he was on his carabout something and i thought id better not

aside to let him pass with a dazedlook and a mechanical movement</s>  there was something comic in his ruefulbewilderment to march who was tempted to smile but he said to himselfthat he had as much reason to be unhappy as fulkerson and he didnot smile</s>  his indignation kept him hot in his purpose to suffer anyconsequence rather than submit to the dictation of a man like dryfooshe felt keenly the degradation of his connection with him and all hisresentment of fulkersons original uncandor returned at the same timehis heart ached with foreboding</s>  it was not merely the work in which hehad

the office</s> did you think i would go back there isabel</s>  asked march with ahaggard look</s>  well if you say so i will go back and do what dryfoosordered me to do</s>  im sufficiently cowed between him and you i canassure you</s> nonsense she said</s>  i approve of everything you did</s>  but sit downnow and dont keep walking that way and let me see if i understand itperfectly</s>  of course i had to have my say out</s> she made him go all over his talk with dryfoos again and report his ownlanguage precisely</s>  from time to time as she got his points she saidthat was splendid good enough for him</s>  and oh im so glad yousaid that to him</s>  at the end she saidwell now lets look at it from his point of view</s>  lets be perfectlyjust to him before we take another step forward</s> or backward march suggested ruefully</s>  the case is simply this heowns the magazine</s> of course</s> and he has a right to expect that i will consider his pecuniaryinterestsoh those detestable pecuniary interests</s>  dont you wish there wasntany money in the world</s> yes or else that there was a great deal more of it</s>  and i wasperfectly willing to do that</s>  i have always kept that in mind as oneof my duties to him ever since i understood what his relation to themagazine was</s> yes i can bear witness to that in any court of justice</s>  youve done ita great deal more than i could basil</s>  and it was just the same way withthose horrible insurance people</s> i know march went on trying to be proof against her flatteriesor at least to look as if he did not deserve praise i know that whatlindau said was offensive to him and i can understand how he felt thathe had a right to punish it</s>  all i say is that he had no right to punishit through me</s> yes said mrs</s>  march askingly</s> if it had been a question of making every other week the vehicleof lindaus peculiar opinionsthough theyre not so very peculiar hemight have got the most of them out of ruskini shouldnt have had anyground to stand on or at least then i should have had to ask myselfwhether his opinions would be injurious to the magazine or not</s> i dont see mrs</s>  march interpolated how they could hurt it muchworse than colonel woodburns article crying up slavery</s> well said march impartially we could print a dozen articlespraising the slavery its impossible to have back and it wouldnt hurtus</s>  but if we printed one paper against the slavery which lindau claimsstill exists some people would call us bad names and the countingroomwould begin to feel it</s>  but that isnt the point</s>  lindaus connectionwith every other week is almost purely mechanical hes merely atranslator of such stories and sketches as he first submits to meand it isnt at all a question of his opinions hurting us but ofmy becoming an agent to punish him for his opinions</s>  that is what iwouldnt do thats what i never will do</s> if you did said his wife i should perfectly despise you</s>  i didntunderstand how it was before</s>  i thought you were just holding outagainst dryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone with you and becauseyou wouldnt recognize his authority</s>  but now im with you basil everytime as that horrid little fulkerson says</s>  but who would ever havesupposed he would be so base as to side against you</s> i dont know said march thoughtfully that we had a right to expectanything else</s>  fulkersons standards are low theyre merely businessstandards and the good thats in him is incidental and somethingquite apart from his morals and methods</s>  hes naturally a generous andrightminded creature but life has taught him to truckle and tricklike the rest of us</s> it hasnt taught you that basil</s> dont be so sure</s>  perhaps its only that im a poor scholar</s>  but idont know really that i despise fulkerson so much for his course thismorning as for his gross and fulsome flatteries of dryfoos last night</s>  icould hardly stomach it</s> his wife made him tell her what they were and then she said yes thatwas loathsome i couldnt have believed it of mr</s>  fulkerson</s> perhaps he only did it to keep the talk going and to give the old mana chance to say something march leniently suggested</s>  it was a worseeffect because he didnt or couldnt follow up fulkersons lead</s> it was loathsome all the same his wife insisted</s>  its the end ofmr</s>  fulkerson as far as im concerned</s> i didnt tell you before march resumed after a moment of my littleinterview with conrad dryfoos after his father left and now he went onto repeat what had passed between him and the young man</s> i suspect that he and his father had been having some words beforethe old man came up to talk with me and that it was that made him sofurious</s> yes but what a strange position for the son of such a man to take</s>  doyou suppose he says such things to his father</s> i dont know but i suspect that in his meek way conrad would saywhat he believed to anybody</s>  i suppose we must regard him as a kind ofcrank</s> poor young fellow</s>  he always makes me feel sad somehow</s>  he has such apathetic face</s>  i dont believe i ever saw him look quite happy exceptthat night at mrs</s>  horns when he was talking with miss vance and thenhe made me feel sadder than ever</s> i dont envy him the life he leads at home with those convictions ofhis</s>  i dont see why it wouldnt be as tolerable there for old lindauhimself</s> well now said mrs</s>  march let us put them all out of our minds andsee what we are going to do ourselves</s> they began to consider their ways and means and how and where theyshould live in view of marchs severance of his relations with everyother week</s>  they had not saved anything from the first years salarythey had only prepared to save and they had nothing solid but theirtwo thousand to count upon</s>  but they built a future in which they easilylived on that and on what march earned with his pen</s>  he became a freelance and fought in whatever cause he thought just he had no tiesno chains</s>  they went back to boston with the heroic will to do what wasmost distasteful they would have returned to their own house if theyhad not rented it again but any rate mrs</s>  march helped out by takingboarders or perhaps only letting rooms to lodgers</s>  they had some hardstruggles but they succeeded</s> the great thing she said is to be right</s>  im ten times as happyas if you had come home and told me that you had consented to do whatdryfoos asked and he had doubled your salary</s> i dont think that would have happened in any event said marchdryly</s> well no matter</s>  i just used it for an example</s> they both experienced a buoyant relief such as seems to come to peoplewho begin life anew on whatever terms</s>  i hope we are young enough yetbasil she said and she would not have it when he said they had oncebeen younger</s> they heard the childrens knock on the door they knocked when they camehome from school so that their mother might let them in</s>  shall we tellthem at once</s>  she asked and ran to open for them before march couldanswer</s> they were not alone</s>  fulkerson smiling from ear to ear was with them</s> is march in</s>  he asked</s> mr</s>  march is at home yes she said very haughtily</s>  hes in hisstudy and she led the way there while the children went to theirrooms</s> well march fulkerson called out at sight of him its all right</s> the old man has come down</s> i suppose if you gentlemen are going to talk business mrs</s>  marchbegan</s> oh we dont want you to go away said fulkerson</s>  i reckon march hastold you anyway</s> yes ive told her said march</s>  dont go isabel</s>  what do you meanfulkerson</s> hes just gone on up home and he sent me round with his apologies</s> he sees now that he had no business to speak to you as he did and hewithdraws everything</s>  hed a come round himself if id said so but itold him i could make it all right</s> fulkerson looked so happy in having the whole affair put right and themarches knew him to be so kindly affected toward them that they couldnot refuse for the moment to share his mood</s>  they felt themselvesslipping down from the moral height which they had gained and marchmade a clutch to stay himself with the question and lindau</s> well said fulkerson hes going to leave lindau to me</s>  you wonthave anything to do with it</s>  ill let the old fellow down easy</s> do you mean asked march that mr</s>  dryfoos insists on his beingdismissed</s> why there isnt any dismissing about it fulkerson argued</s>  if youdont send him any more work he wont do any more thats all</s>  or if hecomes round you canhes to be referred to me</s> march shook his head and his wife with a sigh felt herself plucked upfrom the soft circumstance of their lives which she had sunk back intoso quickly and set beside him on that cold peak of principle again</s>  itwont do fulkerson</s>  its very good of you and all that but it comesto the same thing in the end</s>  i could have gone on without any apologyfrom mr</s>  dryfoos he transcended his authority but thats a minormatter</s>  i could have excused it to his ignorance of life amonggentlemen but i cant consent to lindaus dismissalit comes to thatwhether you do it or i do it and whether its a positive or a negativethingbecause he holds this opinion or that</s> but dont you see said fulkerson that its just lindaus opinionsthe old man cant stand</s>  he hasnt got anything against him personally</s> i dont suppose theres anybody that appreciates lindau in some waysmore than the old man does</s> i understand</s>  he wants to punish him for his opinions</s>  well i cantconsent to that directly or indirectly</s>  we dont print his opinionsand he has a perfect right to hold them whether mr</s>  dryfoos agrees withthem or not</s> mrs</s>  march had judged it decorous for her to say nothing but she nowwent and sat down in the chair next her husband</s> ah dog on it</s>  cried fulkerson rumpling his hair with both his hands</s> what am i to do</s>  the old man says hes got to go</s> and i dont consent to his going said march</s> and you wont stay if he goes</s> fulkerson rose</s>  well well</s>  ive got to see about it</s>  im afraid theold man wont stand it march i am indeed</s>  i wish youd reconsider</s> iid take it as a personal favor if you would</s>  it leaves me in a fix</s> you see ive got to side with one or the other</s> march made no reply to this except to say yes you must stand by himor you must stand by me</s> well well</s>  hold on awhile</s>  ill see you in the morning</s>  dont take anystepsoh there are no steps to take said march with a melancholy smile</s> the steps are stopped thats all</s>  he sank back into his chair whenfulkerson was gone and drew a long breath</s>  this is pretty rough</s>  ithought we had got through it</s> no said his wife</s>  it seems as if i had to make the fight all overagain</s> well its a good thing its a holy war</s> i cant bear the suspense</s>  why didnt you tell him outright youwouldnt go back on any terms</s> i might as well and got the glory</s>  hell never move dryfoos</s>  i supposewe both would like to go back if we could</s> oh i suppose so</s> they could not regain their lost exaltation their lost dignity</s>  atdinner mrs</s>  march asked the children how they would like to go back toboston to live</s> why were not going are we</s>  asked tom without enthusiasm</s> i was just wondering how you felt about it now she said with anunderlook at her husband</s> well if we go back said bella i want to live on the back bay</s>  itsawfully micky at the south end</s> i suppose i should go to harvard said tom and id room out atcambridge</s>  it would be easier to get at you on the back bay</s> the parents smiled ruefully at each other and in view of these grandexpectations of his children march resolved to go as far as he could inmeeting dryfooss wishes</s>  he proposed the theatre as a distraction fromthe anxieties that he knew were pressing equally on his wife</s>  we mightgo to the old homestead he suggested with a sad irony which onlyhis wife felt</s> oh yes lets</s>  cried bella</s> while they were getting ready some one rang and bella went to thedoor and then came to tell her father that it was mr</s>  lindau</s>  he sayshe wants to see you just a moment</s>  hes in the parlor and he wont sitdown or anything</s> what can he

come on</s>  is tomready</s> ix</s> fulkerson parted with the marches in such trouble of mind that he didnot feel able to meet that night the people whom he usually kept so gayat mrs</s>  leightons table</s>  he went to maronis for his dinner for thisreason and for others more obscure</s>  he could not expect to do anythingmore with dryfoos at once he knew that dryfoos must feel that he hadalready made an extreme concession to march and he believed that if hewas to get anything more from him it must be after dryfoos had dined</s> but he was not without the hope vague and indefinite as it might bethat he should find lindau at maronis and perhaps should get someconcession from him some word of regret or apology which he couldreport to dryfoos and at lest make the means of reopening the affairwith him perhaps lindau when he knew how matters stood would backdown altogether and for marchs sake would withdraw from all connectionwith every other week himself and so leave everything serene</s> fulkerson felt capable in his desperation of delicately suggestingsuch a course to lindau or even of plainly advising it he did not carefor lindau a great deal and he did care a great deal for the magazine</s> but he did not find lindau at maronis he only found beaton</s>  he satlooking at the doorway as fulkerson entered and fulkerson naturallycame and took a place at his table</s>  something in beatons largeeyedsolemnity of aspect invited fulkerson to confidence and he said ashe pulled his napkin open and strung it still a little damp as thescanty oftenwashed linen at maronis was apt to be across hisknees i was looking for you this morning to talk with you about thechristmas number and i was a good deal worked up because i couldntfind you but i guess i might as well have spared myself my emotions</s> why</s>  asked beaton briefly</s> well i dont know as theres going to be any christmas number</s> why</s>  beaton asked again</s> row between the financial angel and the literary editor about the chieftranslator and polyglot smeller</s> lindau</s> lindau is his name</s> what does the literary editor expect after lindaus expression of hisviews last night</s> i dont know what he expected but the ground he took with the oldman was that as lindaus opinions didnt characterize his work on themagazine he would not be made the instrument of punishing him for themthe old man wanted him turned off as he calls it</s> seems to be pretty good ground said beaton impartially while hespeculated with a dull trouble at heart on the effect the row wouldhave on his own fortunes</s>  his late visit home had made him feel that theclaim of his family upon him for some repayment of help given could notbe much longer delayed with his mother sick and his father growing oldhe must begin to do something for them but up to this time he had spenthis salary even faster than he had earned it</s>  when fulkerson came in hewas wondering whether he could get him to increase it if he threatenedto give up his work and he wished that he was enough in love withmargaret vance or even christine dryfoos to marry her only to end inthe sorrowful conviction that he was really in love with alma leightonwho had no money and who had apparently no wish to be married for loveeven</s>  and what are you going to do about it</s>  he asked listlessly</s> be dogged if i know what im going to do about it said fulkerson</s> ive been round all day trying to pick up the piecesrow began rightafter breakfast this morningand one time i thought id got the thingall put together again</s>  i got the old man to say that he had spoken tomarch a little too authoritatively about lindau that in fact he oughtto have communicated his wishes through me and that he was willing tohave me get rid of lindau and march neednt have anything to do withit</s>  i thought that was pretty white but march says the apologiesand regrets are all well enough in their way but they leave the mainquestion where they found it</s> what is the main question</s>  beaton asked pouring himself out somechianti</s>  as he set the flask down he made the reflection that if hewould drink water instead of chianti he could send his father threedollars a week on his back debts and he resolved to do it</s> the main question as march looks at it is the question of punishinglindau for his private opinions he says that if he consents to mybouncing the old fellow its the same as if he bounced him</s> it might have that complexion in some lights said beaton</s>  he drankoff his chianti and thought he would have it twice a week or makemaroni keep the halfbottles over for him and send his father twodollars</s>  and what are you going to do now</s> thats what i dont know said fulkerson ruefully</s>  after a moment hesaid desperately beaton youve got a pretty good head why dont yousuggest something</s> why dont you let march go</s>  beaton suggested</s> ah i couldnt said fulkerson</s>  i got him to break up in boston andcome here i like him nobody else could get the hang of the thing likehe has hesa friend</s>  fulkerson said this with the nearest approachhe could make to seriousness which was a kind of unhappiness</s> beaton shrugged</s>  oh if you can afford to have ideals i congratulateyou</s>  theyre too expensive for me</s>  then suppose you get rid ofdryfoos</s> fulkerson laughed forlornly</s>  go on bildad</s>  like to sprinkle a fewashes over my boils</s>  dont mind me</s> they both sat silent a little while and then beaton said i supposeyou havent seen dryfoos the second time</s> no</s>  i came in here to gird up my loins with a little dinner before itackled him</s>  but something seems to be the matter with maronis cook</s>  idont want anything to eat</s> the cookings about as bad as usual said beaton</s>  after a moment headded ironically for he found fulkersons misery a kind of relief fromhis own and was willing to protract it as long as it was amusing whynot try an envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary</s> what do you mean</s> get that other old fool to go to dryfoos for you</s> which other old fool</s>  the old fools seem to be as thick as flies</s> that southern one</s> colonel woodburn</s> mmmmm</s> he did seem to rather take to the colonel</s>  fulkerson mused aloud</s> of course he did</s>  woodburn with his idiotic talk about patriarchalslavery is the man on horseback to dryfooss muddy imagination</s>  hedlisten to him abjectly and hed do whatever woodburn told him to do</s> beaton smiled cynically</s> fulkerson got up and reached for his coat and hat</s>  youve struck itold man</s>  the waiter came up to help him on with his coat fulkersonslipped a dollar in his hand</s>  never mind the coat you can give therest of my dinner to the poor paolo</s>  beaton shake</s>  youve saved mylife little boy though i dont think you meant it</s>  he took beatonshand and solemnly pressed it and then almost ran out of the door</s> they had just reached coffee at mrs</s>  leightons when he arrived and satdown with them and began to put some of the life of his new hope intothem</s>  his appetite revived and after protesting that he would not takeanything but coffee he went back and ate some of the earlier courses</s> but with the pressure of his purpose driving him forward he did notconceal from miss woodburn at least that he was eager to get her apartfrom the rest for some reason</s>  when he accomplished this it seemedas if he had contrived it all himself but perhaps he had not whollycontrived it</s> im so glad to get a chance to speak to you alone he said at onceand while she waited for the next word he made a pause and then saiddesperately i want you to help me and if you cant help me theresno help for me</s> mah goodness she said is the case so bad as that</s>  what in the woaldis the trouble</s> yes its a bad case said fulkerson</s>  i want your father to help me</s> oh i thoat you said me</s> yes i want you to help me with your father</s>  i suppose i ought to go tohim at once but im a little afraid of him</s> and you awe not afraid of me</s>  i dont think thats very flattering mr</s> fulkerson</s>  you ought to think ahm twahce as awful as papa</s> oh i do</s>  you see im quite paralyzed before you and so i dont feelanything</s> well its a pretty lahvely kyand of paralysis</s>  butgo on</s> i willi will</s>  if i can only begin</s> pohaps ah maght begin fo you</s> no you cant</s>  lord knows id like to let you</s>  well its like this</s> fulkerson made a clutch at his hair and then after another hesitationhe abruptly laid the whole affair before her</s>  he did not think itnecessary to state the exact nature of the offence lindau had givendryfoos for he doubted if she could grasp it and he was profuse of hisexcuses for troubling her with the matter and of wonder at himself forhaving done so</s>  in the rapture of his concern at having perhaps made afool of himself he forgot why he had told her but she seemed to likehaving been confided in and she said well ah dont see what you cando with you ahdeals of friendship except stand bah mr</s>  mawch</s> my ideals of friendship</s>  what do you mean</s> oh dont you suppose we know</s>  mr</s>  beaton said you we a pofect bahyardin friendship and you would sacrifice anything to it</s> is that so</s>  said fulkerson thinking how easily he could sacrificelindau in this case</s>  he had never supposed before that he was chivalrousin such matters but he now began to see it in that light and hewondered that he could ever have entertained for a moment the idea ofthrowing march over</s> but ah most say miss woodburn went on ah dont envy you you nextinterview with mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  ah suppose youll have to see him at onceaboat it</s> the conjecture recalled fulkerson to the object of his confidences</s>  ahtheres where your help comes in</s>  ive exhausted all the influence ihave with dryfoosgood gracious you dont expect ah could have any</s> they both laughed at the comic dismay with which she conveyed thepreposterous notion and fulkerson said if i judged from myself ishould expect you to bring him round instantly</s> oh thank you mr</s>  fulkerson she said with mock meekness</s> not at all</s>  but it isnt dryfoos i want you to help me with its yourfather</s>  i want your father to interview dryfoos for me and iim afraidto ask him</s> poo mr</s>  fulkerson</s>  she said and she insinuated something through herburlesque compassion that lifted him to the skies</s>  he swore in his heartthat the woman never lived who was so witty so wise so beautiful andso good</s>  come raght with me this minute if the cyoasts clea</s>  shewent to the door of the diningroom and looked in across its gloom to thelittle gallery where her father sat beside a lamp reading his eveningpaper mrs</s>  leighton could be heard in colloquy with the cook belowand

him</s>  ah suppose youllwant me to tell him aboat it</s> well i wish youd begin miss woodburn he said</s>  the fact is youknow ive been over it so much im kind of sick of the thing</s> miss woodburn advanced and put her hand on her fathers shoulder</s>  lookheah papa</s>  mr</s>  fulkerson wants to ask you something and he wants me todo it fo him</s> the colonel looked up through his glasses with the sort of ferocityelderly men sometimes have to put on in order to keep their glasses fromfalling off</s>  his daughter continued hes got into an awful difficultywith his edito and his proprieto and he wants you to pacify them</s> i do not know whethah i understand the case exactly said the colonelbut mr</s>  fulkerson may command me to the extent of my ability</s> you dont understand it aftah what ahve said</s>  cried the girl</s> then ah dont see but what youll have to explain it youself mr</s> fulkerson</s> well miss woodburn has been so luminous about it colonel saidfulkerson glad of the joking shape she had given the affair that ican only throw in a little sidelight here and there</s> the colonel listened as fulkerson went on with a grave diplomaticsatisfaction</s>  he felt gratified honored even he said by mr</s> fulkersons appeal to him and probably it gave him something of thehigh joy that an affair of honor would have brought him in the dayswhen he had arranged for meetings between gentlemen</s>  next to bearing achallenge this work of composing a difficulty must have been grateful</s> but he gave no outward sign of his satisfaction in making a resume ofthe case so as to get the points clearly in his mind</s> i was afraid sir he said with the state due to the serious natureof the facts that mr</s>  lindau had given mr</s>  dryfoos offence by some ofhis questions at the dinnertable last night</s> perfect red rag to a bull fulkerson put in and then he wanted towithdraw his words at the colonels look of displeasure</s> i have no reflections to make upon mr</s>  landau colonel woodburncontinued and fulkerson felt grateful to him for going on i do notagree with mr</s>  lindau i totally disagree with him on sociologicalpoints but the course of the conversation had invited him to theexpression of his convictions and he had a right to express them sofar as they had no personal bearing</s> of course said fulkerson while miss woodburn perched on the arm ofher fathers chair</s> at the same time sir i think that if mr</s>  dryfoos felt a personalcensure in mr</s>  lindaus questions concerning his suppression of thestrike among his workmen he had a right to resent it</s> exactly fulkerson assented</s> but it must be evident to you sir that a highspirited gentleman likemr</s>  marchi confess that my feelings are with him very warmly in themattercould not submit to dictation of the nature you describe</s> yes i see said fulkerson and with that strange duplex action ofthe human mind he wished that it was his hair and not her fathersthat miss woodburn was poking apart with the corner of her fan</s> mr</s>  lindau the colonel concluded was right from his point ofview and mr</s>  dryfoos was equally right</s>  the position of mr</s>  march isperfectly correcthis daughter dropped to her feet from his chairarm</s>  mah goodness</s> if nobodys in the wrong ho awe you evah going to get the mattahstraight</s> yes you see fulkerson added nobody can give in</s> pardon me said the colonel the case is one in which all can givein</s> i dont know which ll begin said fulkerson</s> the colonel rose</s>  mr</s>  lindau must begin sir</s>  we must begin by seeingmr</s>  lindau and securing from him the assurance that in the expressionof his peculiar views he had no intention of offering any personaloffence to mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  if i have formed a correct estimate of mr</s> lindau this will be perfectly simple</s> fulkerson shook his head</s>  but it wouldnt help</s>  dryfoos dont care arap whether lindau meant any personal offence or not</s>  as far as thatis concerned hes got a hide like a hippopotamus</s>  but what he hatesis lindaus opinions and what he says is that no man who holds suchopinions shall have any work from him</s>  and what march says is that noman shall be punished through him for his opinions he dont care whatthey are</s> the colonel stood a moment in silence</s>  and what do you expect me to dounder the circumstances</s> i came to you for advicei thought you might suggest</s> do you wish me to see mr</s>  dryfoos</s> well thats about the size of it fulkerson admitted</s>  you seecolonel he hastened on i know that you have a great deal ofinfluence with him that article of yours is about the only thing hesever read in every other week and hes proud of your acquaintance</s> well you knowand here fulkerson brought in the figure thatstruck him so much in beatons phrase and had been on his tongue eversinceyoure the man on horseback to him and hed be more apt to dowhat you say than if anybody else said it</s> you are very good sir said the colonel trying to be proof againstthe flattery but i am afraid you overrate my influence</s>  fulkersonlet him ponder it silently and his daughter governed her impatienceby holding her fan against her lips</s>  whatever the process was in thecolonels mind he said at last i see no good reason for decliningto act for you mr</s>  fulkerson and i shall be very happy if i can beof service to you</s>  buthe stopped fulkerson from cutting in withprecipitate thanksi think i have a right sir to ask what yourcourse will be in the event of failure</s> failure</s>  fulkerson repeated in dismay</s> yes sir</s>  i will not conceal from you that this mission is one notwholly agreeable to my feelings</s> oh i understand that colonel and i assure you that i appreciateithere is no use trying to blink the fact sir that there are certainaspects of mr</s>  dryfooss character in which he is not a gentleman</s>  wehave alluded to this fact before and i need not dwell upon it nowi may say however that my misgivings were not wholly removed lastnight</s> no fulkerson assented though in his heart he thought the old man hadbehaved very well</s> what i wish to say now is that i cannot consent to act for you in thismatter merely as an intermediary whose failure would leave the affairin state quo</s> i see said fulkerson</s> and i should like some intimation some assurance as to which partyyour own feelings are with in the difference</s> the colonel bent his eyes sharply on fulkerson miss woodburn let hersfall fulkerson felt that he was being tested and he said to gaintime as between lindau and dryfoos</s>  though he knew this was not thepoint</s> as between mr</s>  dryfoos and mr</s>  march said the colonel</s> fulkerson drew a long breath and took his courage in both hands</s>  therecant be any choice for me in such a case</s>  im for march every time</s> the colonel seized his hand and miss woodburn said if there had beenany choice fo you in such a case i should never have let papa stir astep with you</s> why in regard to that said the colonel with a literal applicationof the idea was it your intention that we should both go</s> well i dont know i suppose it was</s> i think it will be better for me to go alone said the colonel andwith a color from his experience in affairs of honor he added inthese matters a principal cannot appear without compromising hisdignity</s>  i believe i have all the points clearly in mind and i think ishould act more freely in meeting mr</s>  dryfoos alone</s> fulkerson tried to hide the eagerness with which he met these agreeableviews</s>  he felt himself exalted in some sort to the level of thecolonels sentiments though it would not be easy to say whether thiswas through the desperation bred of having committed himself to marchsside or through the buoyant hope he had that the colonel would succeedin his mission</s> im not afraid to talk with dryfoos about it he said</s> there is no question of courage said the colonel</s>  it is a questionof dignityof personal dignity</s> well dont let that delay you papa said his daughter following himto the door where she

tookher view that it was a reward of his courage in having dared the worst</s> they both felt as the newly plighted always do that they were in thebest relations with the beneficent powers and that

perhaps none the colonel admitted</s>  but he added i should like theopportunity of taking mr</s>  lindaus hand in the presence of mr</s>  dryfoosand assuring him that i considered him a man of

the affairs of every other week settled into theirwonted form again and for fulkerson they seemed thoroughly reinstated</s> but march had a feeling of impermanency from what had happened mixedwith a fantastic sense of shame toward lindau</s>  he did not sympathizewith lindaus opinions he thought his remedy for existing evils aswildly impracticable as colonel woodburns</s>  but while he thought thisand while he could justly blame fulkerson for lindaus presence atdryfooss dinner which his zeal had brought about in spite of marchsprotests still he could not rid himself of the reproach of uncandorwith lindau</s>  he ought to have told him frankly about the ownership ofthe magazine and what manner of man the man was whose money he wastaking</s>  but he said that he never could have imagined that he wasserious in his preposterous attitude in regard to a class of men whoembody half the prosperity of the country and he had moments ofrevolt against his own humiliation before lindau in which he found itmonstrous that he should return dryfooss money as if it had been thespoil of a robber</s>  his wife agreed with him in these moments and saidit was a great relief not to have that tiresome old german coming about</s> they had to account for his absence evasively to the children whomthey could not very well tell that their father was living on money thatlindau disdained to take even though lindau was wrong and their fatherwas right</s>  this heightened mrs</s>  marchs resentment toward both lindauand dryfoos who between them had placed her husband in a falseposition</s>  if anything she resented dryfooss conduct more thanlindaus</s>  he had never spoken to march about the affair since lindau hadrenounced his work or added to the apologetic messages he had sent byfulkerson</s>  so far as march knew dryfoos had been left to suppose thatlindau had simply stopped for some reason that did not personally affecthim</s>  they never spoke of him and march was too proud to ask eitherfulkerson or conrad whether the old man knew that lindau had returnedhis money</s>  he avoided talking to conrad from a feeling that if he didhe should involuntarily lead him on to speak of his differences with hisfather</s>  between himself and fulkerson even he was uneasily aware ofa want of their old perfect friendliness</s>  fulkerson had finally behavedwith honor and courage but his provisional reluctance had given marchthe measure of fulkersons character in one direction and he could notignore the fact that it was smaller than he could have wished</s> he could not make out whether fulkerson shared his discomfort or not</s> it certainly wore away even with march as time passed and withfulkerson in the bliss of his fortunate love it was probably farmore transient if it existed at all</s>  he advanced into the winter asradiantly as if to meet the spring and he said that if there were anypleasanter month of the year than november it was december especiallywhen the weather was good and wet and muddy most of the time so thatyou had to keep indoors a long while after you called anywhere</s> colonel woodburn had the anxiety in view of his daughters engagementwhen she asked his consent to it that such a dreamer must have inregard to any reality that threatens to affect the course of hisreveries</s>  he had not perhaps taken her marriage into account exceptas a remote contingency and certainly fulkerson was not the kind ofsoninlaw that he had imagined in dealing with that abstraction</s>  butbecause he had nothing of the sort definitely in mind he could notoppose the selection of fulkerson with success he really knew nothingagainst him and he knew many things in his favor fulkerson inspiredhim with the liking that every one felt for him in a measure he amusedhim he cheered him and the colonel had been so much used to leavingaction of all kinds to his daughter that when he came to close quarterswith the question of a soninlaw he felt helpless to decide it andhe let her decide it as if it were still to be decided when it wassubmitted to him</s>  she was competent to treat it in all its phasesnot merely those of

and right mind andshe liked the immediate practicality as well as the final honor offulkerson</s>  she did not idealize him but in the highest effect sherealized him she did him justice and she would not have believedthat she did him more than justice if she had sometimes known him to dohimself less</s> their engagement was a fact to which the leighton household adjusteditself almost as simply as the lovers themselves miss woodburn told theladies at once and it was not a thing that fulkerson could keep frommarch very long</s>  he sent word of it to mrs</s>  march by her husbandand his engagement perhaps did more than anything else to confirm theconfidence in him which had been shaken by his early behavior in thelindau episode and not wholly restored by his tardy fidelity to march</s> but now she felt that a man who wished to get married so obviously andentirely for love was full of all kinds of the best instincts and onlyneeded the guidance of a wife to become very noble</s>  she interestedherself intensely in balancing the respective merits of the engagedcouple and after her call upon miss woodburn in her new character sheprided herself upon recognizing the worth of some strictly southernqualities in her while maintaining the general average of new englandsuperiority</s>  she could not reconcile herself to the virginian customillustrated in her having been christened with the surname of madisonand she said that its pet form of mad which fulkerson promptlyinvented only made it more ridiculous</s> fulkerson was slower in telling beaton</s>  he was afraid somehow ofbeatons taking the matter in the cynical way miss woodburn said shewould break off the engagement if beaton was left to guess it or findit out by accident and then fulkerson plucked up his courage</s>  beatonreceived the news with gravity and with a sort of melancholy meeknessthat strongly moved fulkersons sympathy and made him wish that beatonwas engaged too</s> it made beaton feel very old it somehow left him behind andforgotten in a manner it made him feel trifled with</s>  something of theunfriendliness of fate seemed to overcast his resentment and he allowedthe sadness of his conviction that he had not the means to marry onto tinge his recognition of the fact that alma leighton would not havewanted him to marry her if he had</s>  he was now often in that martyr moodin which he wished to help his father not only to deny himself chiantibut to forego a furlined overcoat which he intended to get for thewinter he postponed the moment of actual sacrifice as regarded thechianti and he bought the overcoat in an anguish of selfreproach</s> he wore it the first evening after he got it in going to call uponthe leightons and it seemed to him a piece of ghastly

thats it</s>  but a little more animation as when a great thought strikes along the brain and flushes all the cheek</s> she put her forehead down on the back of her hand and laughed again</s> you

he enjoyed the excitement of it and he kept the office boyrunning out to buy the extras which the newsmen came crying through thestreet almost every hour with a lamentable unintelligible noise</s>  heread not only the latest intelligence of the strike but the editorialcomments on it which praised the firm attitude of both parties andthe admirable measures taken by the police to preserve order</s>  fulkersonenjoyed the interviews with the police captains and the leaders of thestrike he equally enjoyed the attempts of the reporters to interviewthe road managers which were so graphically detailed and with sucha fine feeling for the right use of scareheads as to have almost thevalue of direct expression from them though it seemed that they hadresolutely refused to speak</s>  he said at secondhand from the papersthat if the men behaved themselves and respected the rights of propertythey would have public sympathy with them every time but just as soonas they began to interfere with the roads right to manage their ownaffairs in their own way they must be put down with an iron hand thephrase iron hand did fulkerson almost as much good as if it had neverbeen used before</s>  news began to come of fighting between the police andthe strikers when the roads tried to move their cars with men importedfrom philadelphia and then fulkerson rejoiced at the splendid courageof the police</s>  at the same time he believed what the strikers saidand that the trouble was not made by them but by gangs of roughs actingwithout their approval</s>  in this juncture he was relieved by the arrivalof the state board of arbitration which took up its quarters with agreat many scareheads at one of the principal hotels and invited theroads and the strikers to lay the matter

their grievance</s>  the road were as one road indeclaring that there was nothing to arbitrate and that they were merelyasserting their right to manage their own affairs in their own way</s>  oneof

to say perhapsbecause the extras did not but march laughed at this result</s> its a good deal like the military manoeuvre of the king of france andhis forty thousand men</s>  i suppose somebody told him at the top of thehill that there was nothing to arbitrate and to get out and go abouthis business and that was the reason he marched down after he hadmarched up with all that ceremony</s>  what amuses me is to find that in anaffair of this kind the roads have rights and the strikers have rightsbut the public has no rights at all</s>  the roads and the strikers areallowed to fight out a private war in our midst as thoroughly andprecisely a private war as any we despise the middle ages for havingtoleratedas any street war in florence or veronaand to fight it outat our pains and

daunted by this viewof the case</s> do</s>  nothing</s>  hasnt the state board of arbitration declared itselfpowerless</s>  we have no hold upon the strikers and were so used to beingsnubbed and

negative expressions as significant as itsmore violent phases</s>  he had promised his wife solemnly that he wouldkeep away from these and he had a natural inclination to keep hispromise he had no

the officer gave him a surly glance and made him no answer</s> his behavior from a man born to the joking give and take of our lifeimpressed march</s>  it gave him a fine sense of the ferocity which he hadread of the french troops putting on toward the populace just before thecoup detat he began to feel like the populace but he struggled withhimself and regained his character of philosophical observer</s>  in thischaracter he remained in the car and let it carry him by the cornerwhere he ought to have got out and gone home and let it keep on withhim to one of the farthermost tracks westward where so much of thefighting was reported to have taken place</s>  but everything on the way wasas quiet as on the east side</s> suddenly the car stopped with so quick a turn of the brake that hewas half thrown from his seat and the policeman jumped down from theplatform and ran forward</s> ivdryfoos sat at breakfast that morning with mrs</s>  mandel as usual to pourout his coffee</s>  conrad had gone downtown the two girls lay abed muchlater than their father breakfasted and their mother had graduallygrown too feeble to come down till lunch</s>  suddenly christine appeared atthe door</s>  her face was white to the edges of her lips and her eyes wereblazing</s> look here father</s>  have you been saying anything to mr</s>  beaton</s> the old man looked up at her across his coffeecup through his frowningbrows</s>  no</s> mrs</s>  mandel dropped her eyes and the spoon shook in her hand</s> then whats the reason he dont come here any more</s>  demanded the girland her

her father began</s> christine advanced from the doorway toward the table she had her handsclosed upon what seemed trinkets some of which glittered and dangledfrom them</s>  she said will you go to him and tell him that thismeddlesome minx here had no business to say anything about me to himand you take it all back</s> no</s>  shouted the old man</s>  and ifthats all i want of you</s>  the girl shouted in her turn</s>  here areyour presents</s>  with both hands she flung the jewelspins and rings andearrings and braceletsamong the breakfastdishes from which some ofthem sprang to the floor</s>  she stood a moment to pull the intaglio ringfrom the finger where beaton put it a year ago and dashed that at herfathers plate</s>  then she whirled out of the room and they heard herrunning upstairs</s> the old man made a start toward her but he fell back in his chairbefore she was gone and with a fierce grinding movement of his jawscontrolled himself</s>  taketake those things up he gasped to mrs</s> mandel</s>  he seemed unable to rise again from his chair but when sheasked him if he were unwell he said no with an air of offence and gotquickly to his feet</s>  he mechanically picked up the intaglio ring fromthe table while he stood there and put it on his little finger hishand was not much bigger than christines</s>  how do you suppose she foundit out</s>  he asked after a moment</s> she seems to have merely suspected it said mrs</s>  mandel in a tremorand with the fright in her eyes which christines violence had broughtthere</s> well it dont make any difference</s>  she had to know somehow and nowshe knows</s>  he started toward the door of the library as if to go intothe hall where his hat and coat hung</s> mr</s>  dryfoos palpitated mrs</s>  mandel i cant remain here after thelanguage your daughter has used to mei cant let you leave meiimafraid of herlock yourself up then said the old man rudely</s>  he added from thehall before he went out i reckon shell quiet down now</s> he took the elevated road</s>  the strike seemed a vary faroff thingthough the paper he bought to look up the stockmarket was full of noisytypography about yesterdays troubles on the surface lines</s>  among themillions in wall street there was some joking and some swearing but notmuch thinking about the six thousand men who had taken such chances intheir attempt to better their condition</s>  dryfoos heard nothing of thestrike in the lobby of the stock exchange where he spent two or threehours watching a favorite stock of his go up and go down under thebetting</s>  by the time the exchange closed it had risen eight points andon this and some other investments he was five thousand dollars richerthan he had been in the morning</s>  but he had expected to be richerstill and he was by no means satisfied with his luck</s>  all through theexcitement of his winning and losing had played the dull murderous ragehe felt toward they child who had defied him and when the game was overand he started home his rage mounted into a sort of frenzy he wouldteach her he would break her</s>  he walked a long way without thinkingand then waited for a car</s>  none came and he hailed a passing coupe</s> what has got all the cars</s>  he demanded of the driver who jumped downfrom his box to open the door for him and get his direction</s> been away</s>  asked the driver</s>  hasnt been any car along for a week</s> strike</s> oh yes said dryfoos</s>  he felt suddenly giddy and he remained staringat the driver after he had taken his seat</s> the man asked where to</s> dryfoos could not think of his street or number and he said withuncontrollable fury i told you once</s>  go up to west eleventh and drivealong slow on the south side ill show you the place</s> he could not remember the number of every other week office wherehe suddenly decided to stop before he went home</s>  he wished to seefulkerson and ask him something about beaton whether he had beenabout lately and whether he had dropped any hint of what had happenedconcerning christine dryfoos believed that fulkerson was in thefellows confidence</s> there was nobody but conrad in the countingroom whither dryfoosreturned after glancing into fulkersons empty office</s>  wheresfulkerson</s>  he asked sitting down with his hat on</s> he went out a few moments ago said conrad glancing at the clock</s> im afraid he isnt coming back again today if you wanted to see him</s> dryfoos twisted his head sidewise and upward to indicate marchs room</s> that other fellow out too</s> he went just before mr</s>  fulkerson answered conrad</s> do you generally knock off here in the middle of the afternoon</s>  askedthe old man</s> no said conrad as patiently as if his father had not been there ascore of times and found the whole staff of every other week at workbetween four and five</s>  mr</s>  march you know always takes a good dealof his work home with him and i suppose mr</s>  fulkerson went out so earlybecause there isnt much doing today</s>  perhaps its the strike thatmakes it dull</s> the strikeyes</s>  its a pretty piece of business to have everythingthrown out because a parcel of lazy hounds want a chance to lay off andget drunk</s>  dryfoos seemed to think conrad would make some answerto this but the young mans mild face merely saddened and he saidnothing</s>  ive got a coupe out there now that i had to take because icouldnt get a car</s>  if i had my way id have a lot of those vagabondshung</s>  theyre waiting to get the city into a snarl and then rob thehousespack of dirty worthless whelps</s>  they ought to call out themilitia and fire into em</s>  clubbing is too good for them</s>  conrad wasstill silent and his father sneered but i reckon you dont think so</s> i think the strike is useless said conrad</s> oh you do do you</s>  comin to your senses a little</s>  gettin tiredwalkin so much</s>  i should like to know what your gentlemen over there onthe east side think about the strike anyway</s> the young fellow dropped his eyes</s>  i am not authorized to speak forthem</s> oh indeed</s>  and perhaps youre not authorized to speak for yourself</s> father you know we dont agree about these things</s>  id rather nottalkbut im goin to make you talk this time</s>  cried dryfoos strikingthe arm of the chair he sat in with the side of his fist</s>  a maddeningthought of christine came over him</s>  as long as you eat my bread youhave got to do as i say</s>  i wont have my children telling me what ishall do and shant do or take on airs of being holier than me</s>  nowyou just speak up</s>  do you think those loafers are right or dont you</s> come</s> conrad apparently judged it best to speak</s>  i think they were veryfoolish to strikeat this time when the elevated roads can do thework</s> oh at this time heigh</s>  and i suppose they think over there on theeast side that it d been wise to strike before we got the elevated</s> conrad again refused to answer and his father roared what do youthink</s> i think a strike is always bad business</s>  its war but sometimes theredont seem any other way for the workingmen to get justice</s>  they saythat sometimes strikes do raise the wages after a while</s> those lazy devils were paid enough already shrieked the old man</s> they got two dollars a day</s>  how much do you think they ought to agot</s>  twenty</s> conrad hesitated with a beseeching look at his father</s>  but he decidedto answer</s>  the men say that with partial work and fines and otherthings they get sometimes a dollar and sometimes ninety cents a day</s> they lie and you know they lie said his father rising and comingtoward him</s>  and what do you think the upshot of it all will be aftertheyve ruined business for another week and made people hire hacksand stolen the money of honest men</s>  how is it going to end</s> they will have to give in</s> oh give in heigh</s>  and what will you say then i should like to know</s> how will you feel about it then</s>  speak</s> i shall feel as i do now</s>  i know you dont think that way and i dontblame youor anybody</s>  but if i have got to say how i shall feel whyi shall feel sorry they didnt succeed for i believe they have arighteous cause though they go the wrong way to help themselves</s> his father came close to him his eyes blazing his teeth set</s>  do youdare so say that to me</s> yes</s>  i cant help it</s>  i pity them my whole heart is with those poormen</s> you impudent puppy</s>  shouted the old man</s>  he lifted his hand and struckhis son in the face</s>  conrad caught his hand with his own left andwhile the blood began to trickle from a wound that christines intaglioring had made in his temple he looked at him with a kind of grievingwonder and said father</s> the old man wrenched his fist away and ran out of the house</s>  heremembered his address now and he gave it as he plunged into the coupe</s> he trembled with his evil passion and glared out of the windows at thepassers as he drove home he only saw conrads mild grieving wonderingeyes and the blood slowly trickling from the wound in his temple</s> conrad went to the neatset bowl in fulkersons comfortable room andwashed the blood away and kept bathing the wound with the cold watertill it stopped bleeding</s>  the cut was not deep and he thought hewould not put anything on it</s>  after a while he locked up the office andstarted out he hardly knew where</s>  but he walked on in the directionhe had taken till he found himself in union square on the pavementin front of brentanos</s>  it seemed to him that he heard some one callinggently to him mr</s>  dryfoos</s> v</s> conrad looked confusedly around and the same voice said again mr</s> dryfoos</s>  and he saw that it was a lady speaking to him from a coupebeside the curbing and then he saw that it was miss vance</s> she smiled when he gave signs of having discovered her and came up tothe door of her carriage</s>  i am so glad to meet you</s>  i have been longingto talk to somebody nobody seems to feel about it as i do</s>  oh isnt ithorrible</s>  must

wrung his hand hard</s> thank you thank you</s>  you are good and you are just</s>  but no one can doanything</s>  its useless</s> the type of irreproachable coachman on the box whose respectability hadsuffered through the strange behavior of his mistress in this interviewdrove quickly off at her signal and conrad stood a moment looking afterthe carriage</s>  his heart was full of joy it leaped

glad of that since she shared it</s>  he was only sorry forhis father</s>  poor father</s>  he said under his breath as he went along</s> he explained to her about his father in his reverie and she pitied hisfather too</s> he was walking over toward the west side aimlessly at first and thenat times with the longing to do something to save those mistaken menfrom themselves forming itself into a purpose</s>  was not that what shemeant when she bewailed her womans helplessness</s>  she must have wishedhim to try if he being a man could not do something or if she didnot still he would try and if she heard of it she would recall whatshe had said and would be glad he had understood her so</s>  thinking of herpleasure in what he was going to do he forgot almost what it was butwhen he came to a streetcar track he remembered it and looked up anddown to see if there were any turbulent gathering of men whom he mightmingle with and help to keep from violence</s>  he saw none anywhere andthen suddenly as if at the same moment for in his exalted mood allevents had a dreamlike simultaneity he stood at the corner of anavenue and in the middle of it a little way off was a streetcar andaround the car a tumult of shouting cursing struggling men</s>  the driverwas lashing his horses forward and a policeman was at their heads withthe conductor pulling them stones clubs brickbats hailed upon thecar the horses the men trying to move them</s>  the mob closed upon themin a body and then a patrolwagon whirled up from the other side anda squad of policemen leaped out and began to club the rioters</s>  conradcould see how they struck them under the rims of their hats the blowson their skulls sounded as if they had fallen on stone the rioters ranin all directions</s> one of the officers rushed up toward the corner where conrad stood andthen he saw at his side a tall old man with a long white beard whowas calling out at the policemen ah yes</s>  glup the strikerssgifit to them</s>  why dont you co and glup the bresidents that insoaltyour lawss and gick your boart of arpidration outoftoors</s>  glup thestrikerssthey cot no friendts</s>  they cot no money to pribe you todreat

wrist</s>  he heard a shot inthat turmoil beside the car and something seemed to strike him in thebreast</s>  he was going to say to the policeman dont strike him</s>  hes anold soldier</s>  you see he has no hand</s>  but he could not speak he couldnot move his tongue</s>  the policeman stood there he saw his face itwas not bad not cruel it was like the face of a statue fixedperdurablea mere image of irresponsible and involuntary authority</s> then conrad fell forward pierced through the heart by that shot firedfrom the car</s> march heard the shot as he scrambled out of his car and at the samemoment he saw lindau drop under the club of the policeman who left himwhere he fell and joined the rest of the squad in pursuing the rioters</s> the fighting round the car in the avenue ceased the driver whipped hishorses into a gallop and the place was left empty</s> march would have liked to run he thought how his wife had implored himto keep away from the rioting but he could not have left lindau lyingthere if he would</s>  something stronger than his will drew him to thespot and there he saw conrad dead beside the old man</s> vi</s> in the cares which mrs</s>  march shared with her husband that night she wassupported partly by principle but mainly by the potent excitement whichbewildered conrads family and took all reality from what had happened</s> it was nearly midnight when the marches left them and walked away towardthe elevated station with fulkerson</s>  everything had been done bythat time that could be done and fulkerson was not without thatsatisfaction in the

she felt that she ought not to have experienced</s>  but she condonedthe offence a little in herself because her husband remained soconstant in his gravity and pending the final accounting he must makeher for having been where he could be of so much use from the firstinstant of the calamity she was tenderly gratefully proud of all theuse he had been to conrads family and especially his miserable oldfather</s>  to her mind march was the principal actor in the whole affairand much more important in having seen it than those who had suffered init</s>  in fact he had suffered incomparably</s> well well said fulkerson</s>  theyll get along now</s>  weve done all wecould and theres nothing left but for them to bear it</s>  of courseits awful but i guess it ll come out all right</s>  i mean he addedtheyll pull through now</s> i suppose said march that nothing is put on us that we cant bear</s> but i should think he went on musingly that when god sees what wepoor finite

asked march</s> oh he didnt say so</s>  but i just wondered if youd seen him today</s> i think ill go now said march with a pang at heart</s>  he had goneevery day to see lindau but this day he had

perhaps this is aninstinctive perception of the truth that it does go on somewhere butwe have a sense of death as absolutely the end even for earth only if itrelates to some one remote or indifferent to us</s>  march tried to projectlindau to the necessary distance from himself in order to realize thefact in his case but he could not though the man with whom his youthhad been associated in a poetic friendship had not actually reenteredthe region of his affection to the same degree or in any like degree</s> the changed conditions forbade that</s>  he had a soreness of heartconcerning him but he could not make sure whether this soreness wasgrief for his death or remorse for his own uncandor with him aboutdryfoos or a foreboding of that accounting with his conscience whichhe knew his

shoulder and he looked up to havehis hat struck from his head by a horses nose</s>  he saw the horse puthis foot on the hat and he reflected now it will always look like anaccordion and he heard the

picked up his hat and was thinking now i shall haveto tell isabel about this at once and she will never trust me on thestreet again without her mechanically obeyed</s>  her confidence in himhad been undermined by his being so near conrad when he was shot andit went through his mind that he would get dryfoos to drive him to ahatters where he could buy a new hat and not be obliged to confesshis narrow escape to his wife till the incident was some days old andshe could bear it better</s>  it quite drove lindaus death out of his mindfor the moment and when dryfoos said if he was going home he woulddrive up to the first crossstreet and turn back with him march said hewould be glad if he would take him to a hatstore</s>  the old man put hishead out again and told the driver to take them to the fifth avenuehotel</s>  theres a hatstore around there somewhere seems to me hesaid and they talked of marchs accident as well as they could in therattle and clatter of the street till they reached

him he could not speak</s>  he could not make outfrom the close face of the old man anything of his motive</s>  it was setbut set as a piece of broken mechanism is when it has lost the powerto relax

saying to you about me</s>  i knowi had no business to understood it after i let him think i couldnt buti did and i didnt like very well to have a man callin me a traitorand a tyrant at my own table</s>  well i look at it differently now andi reckon i had better have tried to put up with it and i would if icould have known he stopped with a quivering lip and then wenton then again i didnt like his talkin that paternalism of his</s> i always heard it was the worst kind of thing for the country i wasbrought up to think the best government was the one that governs theleast and i didnt

dryfoos</s>  itsall past and gone as far as im concerned but i wanted you to see thati wasnt tryin to punish him for his opinions as you said</s> no i see now march assented though he thought his position stilljustified</s>  i wishi dont know as i understand much about his opinions anyway but iaint ready to say i want the men dependent on me to manage my businessfor me</s>  i always tried to do the square thing by my hands and in thatparticular case out there i took on all the old hands just as fast asthey left their union</s>  as for the game i came on them it was dog eatdog anyway</s> march could have laughed to think how far this old man was from evenconceiving of lindaus pointof view and how he was saying the worstof himself that lindau could have said of him</s>  no one could havecharacterized the kind of thing he had done more severely than he whenhe called it dog eat dog</s> theres a great deal to be said on both sides march began hoping tolead up through this generality to the fact of lindaus death but theold man went onwell all i wanted him to know is that i wasnt trying to punish himfor what he said about things in general</s>  you naturally got that idea ireckon but i always went in for lettin people say what they please andthink what they please its the only way in a free country</s> im afraid mr</s>  dryfoos that it would make little difference to

his thinkinwhatever he pleased</s>  id like him to knowno one can speak to him no one can tell him march began again butagain dryfoos prevented him from going on</s> i understand its a delicate thing and im not askin you to do it</s> what i would really like to doif you think he could be prepared forit some way and could stand itwould be to go to him myself and tellhim just what the trouble was</s>  im in hopes if i done that he couldsee how i felt about it</s> a picture of dryfoos going to the dead lindau with his vain regretspresented itself to march and he tried once more to make the

course</s>  but hes all right he said</s> now it had to come though the fact had been latterly playing fast andloose with marchs consciousness</s>  something almost made him smile thewillingness he had once felt to give this old man pain then he consoledhimself by thinking that at least he was not obliged to meet dryfoosswish to make atonement with the fact that lindau had renounced him andwould on no terms work for such a man as he or suffer any kindness fromhim</s>  in this light lindau seemed the harder of the two and march hadthe momentary force to saymr</s>  dryfoosit cant be</s>

he mused ifone of the reasons why were shut up to our ignorance of what is to behereafter isnt because if we were sure of another world we might bestill more brutal to one another here in the hope of

naturalfor that reason that dryfoos should have lindaus funeral from hishouse</s>  he knew the old man to be darkly groping through the paymentof these vain honors to the dead for some atonement to his son and heimagined him finding in them such comfort as comes from doing all onecan even when all is useless</s> no one knew what lindaus religion was and in default they had had theanglican burial

have died but the effort had its magnanimityits pathos and there was a poetry that appealed to him in thereconciliation through death of men of ideas of conditions that couldonly have gone warring on in life</s>  he thought as the priest went onwith the solemn liturgy how all the world must come together in thatpeace which struggle and strive as we may shall claim us at last</s>  helooked at dryfoos and wondered whether he would consider these ritesa sufficient tribute or whether there was enough in him to make himrealize their futility except as a mere sign of his wish to retrievethe

when she mustleave even this ungentle home for the chances of the ruder worldoutside</s> the old man said nothing at table but when mela went up to see if shecould do anything for christine he asked mrs</s>  mandel again about allthe facts of her last interview with beaton</s> she gave them as fully as she could remember them and the old man madeno comment on them</s>  but he went out directly after and at the everyother week office he climbed the stairs to fulkersons room and askedfor beatons address</s>  no one yet had taken charge of conrads work andfulkerson was running the thing himself as he said till he could talkwith dryfoos about it</s>  the old man would not look into the empty roomwhere he had last seen his son alive he turned his face away andhurried by the door</s> xiii</s> the course of public events carried beatons private affairs beyondthe reach of his simple first intention to renounce his connectionwith every other week</s>  in fact this was not perhaps so simple asit seemed and long before it could be put in effect it appeared stillsimpler to do nothing about the matterto remain passive and leave theinitiative to dryfoos to maintain the dignity of unconsciousness andlet recognition of any change in the situation come from those who hadcaused the change</s>  after all it was rather absurd to propose making apurely personal question the pivot on which his relations with everyother week turned</s>  he took a hint from marchs position and decidedthat he did not know dryfoos in these relations he knew only fulkersonwho had certainly had nothing to do with mrs</s>  mandels asking hisintentions</s>  as he reflected upon this he became less eager to lookfulkerson up and make the magazine a partner of his own sufferings</s>  thiswas the soberer mood to which beaton trusted that night even before heslept and he awoke fully confirmed in it</s>  as he examined the offencedone him in the cold light of day he perceived that it had not comeeither from mrs</s>  mandel who was visibly the faltering and unwillinginstrument of it or from christine who was altogether ignorant ofit but from dryfoos whom he could not hurt by giving up his place</s>  hecould only punish fulkerson by that and fulkerson was innocent</s>  justiceand interest alike dictated the passive course to which beaton inclinedand he reflected that he might safely leave the punishment of dryfoosto christine who would find out what had happened and would be able totake care of herself in any encounter of tempers with her father</s> beaton did not go to the office during the week that followed upon thisconclusion but they were used there to these sudden absences of hisand as his work for the time was in train nothing was made of hisstaying away except the sarcastic comment which the thought of him wasapt to excite in the literary department</s>  he no longer came so much tothe leightons and fulkerson was in no state of mind to miss any onethere except miss woodburn whom he never missed</s>  beaton was left thenunmolestedly awaiting the course of destiny when he read in the morningpaper over his coffee at maronis the deeply scareheaded story ofconrads death and the clubbing of lindau</s>  he probably cared as littlefor either of them as any man that ever saw them but he felt a shockif not a pang at conrads fate so out of keeping with his life andcharacter</s>  he did not know what to do and he did nothing</s>  he was notasked to the funeral but he had not expected that and when fulkersonbrought him notice that lindau was also to be buried from dryfoosshouse it was without his usual sullen vindictiveness that he kept away</s> in his sort and as much as a man could who was necessarily so muchtaken up with himself he was sorry for conrads father beaton had apeculiar tenderness for his own father and he imagined how his fatherwould feel if it were he who had been killed in conrads place as itmight very well have been he sympathized with himself in view of thepossibility and for once they were mistaken who thought him indifferentand merely brutal in his failure to appear at lindaus obsequies</s> he would really have gone if he had known how to reconcile his presencein that house with the terms of his effective banishment from it andhe was rather forgivingly finding himself wronged in the situation whendryfoos knocked at the studio door the morning after lindaus funeral</s> beaton roared out come in</s>  as he always did to a knock if he had nota model if he had a model he set the door slightly ajar and with hispalette on his thumb frowned at his visitor and told him he couldnot come in</s>  dryfoos fumbled about for the knob in the dim passagewayoutside and beaton who had experience of peoples difficulties withit suddenly jerked the door open</s>  the two men stood confronted and atfirst sight of each other their quiescent dislike revived</s>  eachwould have been willing to turn away from the other but that was notpossible</s>  beaton snorted some sort of inarticulate salutation whichdryfoos did not try to return he asked if he could see him alone fora minute or two and beaton bade him come in and swept somepaintblotched rags from the chair which he told him to take</s>  henoticed as the old man sank tremulously into it that his movementwas like that of his own father and also that he looked very muchlike christine</s>  dryfoos folded his hands tremulously on the top of hishornhandled stick and he was rather finely haggard with the darkhollows round his black eyes and the fall of the muscles on either sideof his chin</s>  he had forgotten to take his soft widebrimmed hat offand beaton felt a desire to sketch him just as he sat</s> dryfoos suddenly pulled himself together from the dreary absence intowhich he fell at first</s>  young man he began maybe ive come here ona fools errand and beaton rather fancied that beginning</s> but it embarrassed him a little and he said with a shy glance asidei dont know what you mean</s>  i reckon dryfoos answered quietlyyou got your notion though</s>  i set that woman on to speak to you theway she done</s>  but if there was anything wrong in the way she spoke orif you didnt feel like she had any right to question you up as if wesuspected you of anything mean i want you to say so</s> beaton said nothing and the old man went on</s> i aint very well up in the ways of the world and i dont pretendto be</s>  all i want is to be fair and square with everybody</s>  ive mademistakes though in my time he stopped and beaton was not proofagainst the misery of his face which was twisted as with some strongphysical ache</s>  i dont know as i want to make any more if i can helpit</s>  i dont know but what you had a right to keep on comin and if youhad i want you to say so</s>  dont you be afraid but what ill take it inthe right way</s>  i dont want to take advantage of anybody and i dontask you to say any more than that</s> beaton did not find the humiliation of the man who had humiliated himso sweet as he could have fancied it might be</s>  he knew how it had comeabout and that it was an effect of love for his child it did notmatter by what ungracious means she had brought him to know that heloved her better than his own will that his wish for her happiness wasstronger than his pride it was enough that he was now somehow broughtto give proof of it</s>  beaton could not be aware of all that dark coil ofcircumstance through which dryfooss present action evolved itself theworst of this was buried in the secret of the old mans heart a worm ofperpetual torment</s>  what was apparent to another was that he was brokenby the sorrow that had fallen upon him and it was this that beatonrespected and pitied in his impulse to be frank and kind in his answer</s> no i had no right to keep coming to your house in the way i didunlessunless i meant more than i ever said</s>  beaton added i dontsay that what you did was usualin this country at any rate but icant say you were wrong</s>  since you speak to me about the matter itsonly fair to myself to say that a good deal goes on in life without muchthinking of consequences</s>  thats the way i excuse myself</s> and you say mrs</s>  mandel done right</s>  asked dryfoos as if he wishedsimply to be assured of a point of etiquette</s> yes she did right</s>  ive nothing to complain of</s> thats all i wanted to know said dryfoos but apparently he had notfinished and he did not go though the silence that beaton now keptgave him a chance to do so</s>  he began a series of questions which had norelation to the matter in hand though they were strictly personal tobeaton</s>  what countryman are you</s>  he asked after a moment</s> what countryman</s>  beaton frowned back at him</s> yes are you an american by birth</s> yes i was born in syracuse</s> protestant</s> my father is a scotch seceder</s> what business is your father in</s> beaton faltered and blushed then he answeredhes in the monument business as he calls it</s>  hes a tombstonecutter</s>  now that he was launched beaton saw no reason for notdeclaring my fathers always been a poor man and worked with his ownhands for his living</s>  he had too slight esteem socially for dryfoos toconceal a fact from him that he might have wished to blink with others</s> well thats right said dryfoos</s>  i used to farm it myself</s>  ive gota good pile of money together now</s>  at first it didnt come easy butnow its got started it pours in and pours in it seems like there wasno end to it</s>  ive got well on to three million but it couldnt keep mefrom losin my son</s>  it cant buy me back a minute of his life not allthe money in the world can do it</s> he grieved this out as if to himself rather than to beaton whoscarcely ventured to say i knowi am very sorryhow did you come dryfoos interrupted to take up paintin</s> well i dont know said beaton a little scornfully</s>  you dont takea thing of that kind up i fancy</s>  i always wanted to paint</s> father try to stop you</s> no</s>  it wouldnt have been of any use</s>  whymy son he wanted to be a preacher and i did stop him or i thought idid</s>  but i reckon he was a preacher all the same every minute of hislife</s>  as you say it aint any use to try to stop a thing like that</s>  ireckon if a child has got any particular bent it was given to it andits goin against the grain its goin against the law to try to bendit some other way</s>  theres lots of good business men mr</s>  beaton twentyof em to every good preacher</s> i imagine more than twenty said beaton amused and touched throughhis curiosity as to what the old man was driving at by the quaintsimplicity of his speculations</s> father ever come to the city</s> no he never has the time and my mothers an invalid</s> oh</s>  brothers and sisters</s> yes were a large family</s> i lost two little fellerstwins said dryfoos sadly</s>  but we haintever had but just the five</s>  ever take portraits</s> yes said beaton meeting this zigzag in the queries as seriously asthe rest</s>  i dont think i am good at it</s> dryfoos got to his feet</s>  i wish youd paint a likeness of my son</s> youve seen him plenty of times</s>  we wont fight about the price dontyou be afraid of that</s> beaton was astonished and in a mistaken way he was disgusted</s>  he sawthat dryfoos was trying to undo mrs</s>  mandels work practically and gethim to come again to his house that he now conceived of the offencegiven him as condoned and wished to restore the former situation</s>  heknew that he was attempting this for christines sake but he was notthe man to imagine that dryfoos was trying not only to tolerate him butto like him and in fact dryfoos was not wholly conscious himself ofthis end</s>  what they both understood was that dryfoos was endeavoringto get at beaton through conrads memory but with one this was itsdedication to a purpose of self sacrifice and with the other a vulgarand shameless use of it</s> i couldnt do it said beaton</s>  i couldnt think of attempting it</s> why not</s>  dryfoos persisted</s>  we got some photographs of him he didntlike to sit very well but his mother got him to and you know how helooked</s> i couldnt do iti couldnt</s>  i cant even consider it</s>  im very sorry</s> i would if it were possible</s>  but it isnt possible</s> i reckon if you see the photographs onceit isnt that mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  but im not in the way of that kind ofthing any more</s> id give any price youve a mind to nameoh it isnt the money</s>  cried beaton beginning to lose control ofhimself</s> the old man did not notice him</s>  he sat with his head fallen forward andhis chin resting on his folded hands</s>  thinking of the portrait he sawconrads face before him reproachful astonished but all gentle asit looked when conrad caught his hand that day after he struck him heheard him say father</s>  and the sweat gathered on his forehead</s>  oh mygod</s>  he groaned</s>  no there aint anything i can do now</s> beaton did not know whether dryfoos was speaking to him or not</s>  hestarted toward him</s>  are you ill</s> no there aint anything the matter said the old man</s>  but i guessill lay down on your settee a minute</s>  he tottered with beatons helpto the aesthetic couch covered with a tigerskin on which beaton hadonce thought of painting a cleopatra but he could never get the rightmodel</s>  as the old man stretched himself out on it pale and sufferinghe did not look much like a cleopatra but beaton was struck with hiseffectiveness and the likeness between him and his daughter she wouldmake a very good cleopatra in some ways</s>  all the time while thesethoughts passed through his mind he was afraid dryfoos would die</s> the old man fetched his breath in gasps which presently smoothed andlengthened into his normal breathing</s>  beaton got him a glass of wineand after tasting it he sat up</s> youve got to excuse me he said getting back to his characteristicgrimness with surprising suddenness when once he began to recoverhimself</s>  ive been through a good deal lately and sometimes it ketchesme round the heart like a pain</s> in his life of selfish immunity from grief beaton could not understandthis experience that poignant sorrow brings he said to himself thatdryfoos was going the way of angina pectoris as he began shuffling offthe tigerskin he said had you better get up</s>  wouldnt you like me tocall a doctor</s> im all right young man</s>  dryfoos took his hat and stick from him buthe made for the door so uncertainly that beaton put his hand under hiselbow and helped him out and down the stairs to his coupe</s> hadnt you better let me drive home with you</s>  he asked</s> what</s>  said dryfoos suspiciously</s> beaton repeated his question</s> i guess im able to go home alone said dryfoos in a surly tone andhe put his head out of the window and called up home</s>  to the driverwho immediately started off and left beaton standing beside thecurbstone</s> xiv</s> beaton wasted the rest of the day in the emotions and speculations whichdryfooss call inspired</s>  it was not that they continuously occupied himbut they broke up the train of other thoughts and spoiled him for worka very little spoiled beaton for work he required just the right moodfor work</s>  he comprehended perfectly well that dryfoos had made him thatextraordinary embassy because he wished him to renew his visits and heeasily imagined the means that had brought him to this pass</s>  from whathe knew of that girl he did not envy her father his meeting with herwhen he must tell her his mission had failed</s>  but had it failed</s>  whenbeaton came to ask himself this question he could only perceive that heand dryfoos had failed to find any ground of sympathy and had parted inthe same dislike with which they had met</s>  but as to any other failureit was certainly tacit and it still rested with him to give it effect</s> he could go back to dryfooss house as freely as before and it wasclear that he was very much desired to come back</s>  but if he went back itwas also clear that he must go back with intentions more explicit thanbefore and now he had to ask himself just how much or how little hehad meant by going there</s>  his liking for christine had certainly notincreased but the charm on the other hand of holding a leopardess inleash had not yet palled upon him</s>  in his life of inconstancies it wasa pleasure to rest upon something fixed and the man who had no controlover himself liked logically enough to feel his control of some oneelse</s>  the fact cannot other wise be put in terms and the attractionwhich christine dryfoos had for him apart from this escapes from allterms as anything purely and merely passional must</s>  he had seen fromthe first that she was a cat and so far as youth forecasts such thingshe felt that she would be a shrew</s>  but he had a perverse sense of herbeauty and he knew a sort of life in which her power to molest him withher temper could be reduced to the smallest proportions and even brokento pieces</s>  then the consciousness of her money entered</s>  it was evidentthat the old man had mentioned his millions in the way of a hint tohim of what he might reasonably expect if he would turn and be hissoninlaw</s>  beaton did not put it to himself in those words and in facthis cogitations were not in words at all</s>  it was the play of cognitionsof sensations formlessly tending to the effect which can only be veryclumsily interpreted in language</s>  but when he got to this point in thembeaton rose to magnanimity and in a flash of dramatic reverie disposedof a part of dryfooss riches in placing his father and mother and hisbrothers and sisters beyond all pecuniary anxiety forever</s>  he had noshame no scruple in this for he had been a pensioner upon others eversince a syracusan amateur of the arts had detected his talent and givenhim the money to go and study abroad</s>  beaton had always considered themoney a loan to be repaid out of his future success but he now neverdreamt of repaying it as the man was rich he had even a contempt forthe notion of repaying him but this did not prevent him from feelingvery keenly the hardships he put his father to in borrowing money fromhim though he never repaid his father either</s>  in this reverie he sawhimself sacrificed in marriage with christine dryfoos in a kind ofadmiring selfpity and he was melted by the spectacle of the dignitywith which he suffered all the lifelong trials ensuing from hisunselfishness</s>  the fancy that alma leighton came bitterly to regrethim contributed to soothe and flatter him and he was not sure thatmargaret</s>  vance did not suffer a like loss in him</s> there had been times when as he believed that beautiful girls highthoughts had tended toward him there had been looks gestures evenwords that had this effect to him or that seemed to have had it andbeaton saw that he might easily construe mrs</s>  horns confidential appealto him to get margaret interested in art again as something by no meansnecessarily offensive even though it had been made to him as to amaster of illusion</s>  if mrs</s>  horn had to choose between him and the lifeof good works to which her niece was visibly abandoning herself beatoncould not doubt which she would choose the only question was how realthe danger of a life of good works was</s> as he thought of these two girls one so charming and the other sodivine it became indefinitely difficult to renounce them for christinedryfoos with her sultry temper and her earthbound ideals</s>  life had beenso flattering to beaton hitherto that he could not believe them bothfinally indifferent and if they were not indifferent perhaps he didnot wish either of them to be very definite</s>  what he really longed forwas their sympathy for a man who is able to walk round quite ruthlesslyon the feelings of others often has very tender feelings of his owneasily lacerated and eagerly responsive to the caresses of compassion</s> in this frame beaton determined to go that afternoon though it was notmrs</s>  horns day and call upon her in the hope of possibly seeing missvance alone</s>  as he continued in it he took this for a sign and actuallywent</s>  it did not fall out at once as he wished but he got mrs</s>  hornto talking again about her niece and mrs</s>  horn again regretted thatnothing could be done by the fine arts to reclaim margaret from goodworks</s> is she at home</s>  will you let me see her</s>  asked beacon with somethingof the scientific interest of a physician inquiring for a patient whosesymptoms have been rehearsed to him</s>  he had not asked for her before</s> yes certainly said mrs</s>  horn and she went herself to call margaretand she did not return with her</s>  the girl entered with the gentle gracepeculiar to her and beaton bent as he was on his own consolationcould not help being struck with the spiritual exaltation of her look</s> at sight of her the vague hope he had never quite relinquished thatthey might be something more than aesthetic friends died in his heart</s> she wore black as she often did but in spite of its fashion herdress received a nunlike effect from the pensive absence of her face</s> decidedly thought beaton she is far gone in good works</s> but he rose all the same to meet her on the old level and he began atonce to talk to her of the subject he had been discussing with her aunt</s> he said frankly that they both felt she had unjustifiably turned herback upon possibilities which she ought not to neglect</s> you know very well she answered that i couldnt do anything in thatway worth the time i should waste on it</s>  dont talk of it please</s>  isuppose my aunt has been asking you to say this but its no use</s>  imsorry its no use she

other day</s>  have you seen them any of them lately</s> i havent been there for some time no said beaton evasively</s>  but hethought if he was to get on to anything he had better be candid</s>  mr</s> dryfoos was at my studio this morning</s>  hes got a queer notion</s>  he wantsme to paint his sons portrait</s> she started</s>  and will youno i couldnt do such a thing</s>  it isnt in my way</s>  i told him so</s>  hisson had a beautiful face an antique profile a sort of early christiantype but im too much of a pagan for that sort of thing</s> yes</s> yes beaton continued not quite liking her assent after he hadinvited it</s>  he had his pride in being a pagan a greek but it failedhim in her presence now and he wished that she had protested he wasnone</s>  he was a singular creature a kind of survival an exile inour time and place</s>  i dont know we dont quite expect a saint to berustic but with all his goodness conrad dryfoos was a country person</s> if he were not

he died for a cause she said</s> the holiest</s> of labor</s> of peace</s>  he was there to persuade the strikers to be quiet and gohome</s> i havent been quite sure said beaton</s>  but in any case

in the sight of theworld its the right way</s>  but the blessing on the peacemakers is not forthe policemen with their clubs</s> beaton saw that she was nervous he made his reflection that she wasaltogether too far gone in good works for the fine arts to reach herhe began to think how he could turn her primitive christianity to theaccount of his modern heathenism</s>  he had no deeper design than to getflattered back into his own favor far enough to find courage for somesort of decisive step</s>  in his heart he was trying to will whether heshould or should not go back to dryfooss house</s>  it could not be fromthe caprice that had formerly taken him it must be from a definitepurpose again he realized this</s>  of course you are right he said</s> i wish i could have answered that old man differently</s>  i fancy he wasbound up in his son though he quarrelled with him and crossed him</s>  buti couldnt do it it wasnt possible</s>  he said to himself that if shesaid no now he would be ruled by her agreement with him and if shedisagreed with him he would be ruled still by the chance and would gono more to the dryfooses</s>  he found himself embarrassed to the pointof blushing when she said nothing and left him as it were on his ownhands</s>  i should like to have given him that comfort i fancy he hasntmuch comfort in life but there seems no comfort in me</s> he dropped his head in a fit attitude for compassion but she poured nopity upon it</s> there is no comfort for us in ourselves she said</s>  its hard to getoutside but theres only despair within</s>

nothing to trust to in fact but his knowledgethat he had once had them all she did not deny that but neither didshe conceal that he had flung away his power over them and she had toldhim that they

regard to women he cherishes the superstition of the romances thatlove is once for all and forever</s>  it was because beaton would notbelieve that alma leighton being a woman could put him out of herheart after suffering him to steal into it that he now hoped anythingfrom her and she had been so explicit when they last spoke of thataffair that he did not hope much</s>  he said to himself that

decided to draw upon dryfoos for some money he did not needany but he said maybe the demand would act as a hint upon him</s>  oneday about a week after almas final rejection of beaton dryfoos cameinto marchs office</s>  fulkerson was out but the old man seemed not tohave tried to see him</s> he put his hat on the floor by his chair after he sat down and lookedat march awhile with his old eyes which had the vitreous glitter ofold eyes stimulated to sleeplessness</s>  then he said abruptly mr</s> march how would you like to take this thing off my hands</s> i dont understand exactly march began but of course he understoodthat dryfoos was offering to let him have every other week on someterms or other and his heart leaped with hope</s> the old man knew he understood and so he did not explain</s>  he said iam going to europe to take my family there</s>  the doctor thinks it mightdo my wife some good and i aint very well myself and my girls bothwant to go and so were goin</s>  if you want to take this thing off myhands i reckon i can let you have it in most any shape you say</s>  youreall settled here in new york and i dont suppose you want to break upmuch at your time of life and ive been thinkin whether you wouldntlike to take the thing</s> the word which dryfoos had now used three times made march at lastthink of fulkerson he had been filled too full of himself to thinkof any one else till he had mastered the notion of such wonderfulgood fortune as seemed about falling to him</s>  but now he did think offulkerson and with some shame and confusion for he remembered howwhen dryfoos had last approached him there on the business of hisconnection with every other week he had been very haughty with himand told him that he did not know him in this connection</s>  he blushed tofind how far his thoughts had now run without encountering this obstacleof etiquette</s> have you spoken to mr</s>  fulkerson</s>  he asked</s> no i haint</s>  it aint a question of management</s>  its a question ofbuying and selling</s>  i offer the thing to you first</s>  i reckon fulkersoncouldnt get on very well without you</s> march saw the real difference in the two cases and he was glad tosee it because he could act more decisively if not hampered by anobligation to consistency</s>  i am gratified of course mr</s>  dryfoosextremely gratified and its no use pretending that i shouldnt behappy beyond bounds to get possession of every other week</s>  but i dontfeel quite free to talk about it apart from mr</s>  fulkerson</s> oh all right</s>  said the old man with quick offence</s> march hastened to say i feel bound to mr</s>  fulkerson in every way</s>  hegot me to come here and i couldnt even seem to act without him</s> he put it questioningly and the old man answeredyes i can see that</s>  when ll he be in</s>  i can wait</s>  but he lookedimpatient</s> very soon now said march looking at his watch</s>  he was only to begone a moment and while he went on to talk with dryfoos he wonderedwhy the old man should have come first to speak with him and whetherit was from some obscure wish to make him reparation for displeasures inthe past or from a distrust or dislike of fulkerson</s>  whichever light helooked at it in it was flattering</s> do you think of going abroad soon</s>  he asked</s> what</s>  yesi dont knowi reckon</s>  we got our passage engaged</s>  its onone of them french boats</s>  were goin to paris</s> oh</s>  that will be interesting to the young ladies</s> yes</s>  i reckon were goin for them</s>  taint likely my wife and me wouldwant to pull up stakes at our age said the old man sorrowfully</s> but you may find it do you good mr</s>  dryfoos said march with akindness that was real mixed as it was with the selfish interest he nowhad in the intended voyage</s> well maybe maybe sighed the old man and he dropped his headforward</s>  it dont make a great deal of difference what we do or wedont do for the few years left</s> i hope mrs</s>  dryfoos is as well as usual said march finding theground delicate and difficult</s> middlin middlin said the old man</s>  my daughter christine sheaint very well</s> oh said march</s>  it was quite impossible for him to affect a moreexplicit interest in the fact</s>  he and dryfoos sat silent for a fewmoments and he was vainly casting about in his thought for somethingelse which would tide them over the interval till fulkerson came whenhe heard his step on the stairs</s> hello hello</s>  he said</s>  meeting of the clans</s>  it was always a meetingof the clans with fulkerson or a field day or an extra session ora regular conclave whenever he saw people of any common interesttogether</s>  haint seen you here for a good while mr</s>  dryfoos</s>  did thinksome of running away with every other week one while but couldntseem to work march up to the point</s> he gave dryfoos his hand and pushed aside the papers on the corner ofmarchs desk and sat down there and went on briskly with the nonsensehe could always talk while he was waiting for another to develop anymatter of business he told march afterward that he scented businessin the air as soon as he came into the room where he and dryfoos weresitting</s> dryfoos seemed determined to leave the word to march who said afteran inquiring look at him mr</s>  dryfoos has been proposing to let us haveevery other week fulkerson</s> well thats good that suits yours truly march  fulkersonpublishers and proprietors wont pretend it dont if the terms are allright</s> the terms said the old man are whatever you want em</s>  i havent gotany more use for the concern he gulped and stopped they knew whathe was thinking of and they looked down in pity</s>  he went on i wontput any more money in it but what ive put in aready can stay and youcan pay me four per cent</s> he got upon his feet and march and fulkerson stood too</s> well i call that pretty white said fulkerson</s>  its a bargain as faras im concerned</s>  i suppose youll want to talk it over with your wifemarch</s> yes i shall said march</s>  i can see that its a great chance but iwant to talk it over with my wife</s> well thats right said the old man</s>  let me hear from you tomorrow</s> he went out and fulkerson began to dance round the room</s>  he caughtmarch about his stalwart girth and tried to make him waltz theofficeboy came to the door and looked on with

fulkerson</s>  thats the milk in the cocoanut is it</s> well i thought there must be something</s> but this fact had not changed mrs</s>  march at all in her conviction thatit was mr</s>  dryfooss

because he offers to sell me every other week on easy terms</s> he says himself that he has no further use for the thing and he knowsperfectly well that he couldnt get his money out of it now without

them</s> xvii</s> beaton was at his best when he parted for the last time with almaleighton for he saw then that what had happened to him was thenecessary consequence of what he had been if not what he had done</s> afterward he lost this clear vision he began to deny the fact he drewupon his knowledge of life and in arguing himself into a differentframe of mind he alleged the case of different people who had done andbeen much worse things than he and yet no such disagreeable consequencehad befallen them</s>  then he saw that it was all the work of blind chanceand he said to himself that it was this that made him desperate andwilling to call evil his good and to take his own wherever he couldfind it</s>  there was a great deal that was literary and factitious andtawdry in the mood in which he went to see christine dryfoos the nightwhen the marches sat talking their prospects over and nothing that wasdecided in his purpose</s>  he knew what the drift of his mind was but hehad always preferred to let chance determine his events and now sincechance had played him such an ill turn with alma he left it the wholeresponsibility</s>  not in terms but in effect this was his thought ashe walked on uptown to pay the first of the visits which dryfoos hadpractically invited him to resume</s>  he had an insolent satisfaction inhaving delayed it so long if he was going back he

upon her</s> beaton rang and while the servant was coming the insolent capriceseized him to ask for the young ladies instead of the old man as he hadsupposed of course he should do</s>  the maid who answered the bell in theplace of the reluctant irishman of other days had all his hesitation inadmitting that the young ladies were at home</s> he found mela in the drawingroom</s>  at sight of him

he asked and she felt the cruel mockery and exultantconsciousness of power in his tone as perhaps a wild thing feelscaptivity in the voice of its keeper</s>  but now she said she would stillforgive

andstarted to walk home the doctor had said he ought to walk and he didso though he longed to ride and looked wistfully at the passing cars</s> he knew he was in a rut as his wife often said but if it was a rutit was a support too it kept him from wobbling she always talked as ifthe flowery fields of youth lay on either side of the dusty road he hadbeen going so long and he had but to step aside from it to be amongthe butterflies and buttercups again he sometimes indulged thisillusion himself in a certain ironical spirit which caressed while itmocked the notion</s>  they had a tacit agreement that their youth if theywere ever to find it again was to be looked for in europe where theymet when they were young and they had never been quite without the hopeof going back there some day for a long sojourn</s>  they had not seen thetime when they could do so they were dreamers but as they recognizedeven dreaming is not free from care and in his dream march had beenobliged to work pretty steadily if not too intensely</s>  he had beenforced to forego the distinctly literary ambition with which he hadstarted in life because he had their common living to make and he couldnot make it by writing graceful verse or even graceful prose</s>  he hadbeen many years in a sufficiently distasteful business and he had lostany thought of leaving it when it left him perhaps because his hold onit had always been rather lax and he had not been able to conceal thathe disliked it</s>  at any rate he was supplanted in his insurance agencyat boston by a subordinate in his office and though he was at the sametime offered a place of nominal credit in the employ of the company hewas able to decline it in grace of a chance which united the charm ofcongenial work with the solid advantage of a better salary than he hadbeen getting for work he hated</s>  it was an incredible chance but it wasrendered appreciably real by the necessity it involved that they shouldleave boston where they had lived all their married life where mrs</s> march as well as their children was born and where all their tender andfamiliar ties were and come to new york where the literary enterprisewhich formed his chance was to be founded</s> it was then a magazine of a new sort which his business partner hadimagined in such leisure as the management of a newspaper syndicateafforded him and had always thought of getting march to edit</s>  themagazine which is also a book has since been realized elsewhere on moreor less prosperous terms but not for any long period and every otherweek was apparentlythe only periodical of the kind conditioned forsurvival</s>  it was at first backed by unlimited capital and it had theinstant favor of a popular mood which has since changed but which didnot change so soon that the magazine had not time to establish itself ina wide acceptance</s>  it was now no longer a novelty it was no longerin the maiden blush of its first success but it had entered upon itssecond youth with the reasonable hope of many years of prosperity beforeit</s>  in fact it was a very comfortable living for all concerned and themarches had the conditions almost dismayingly perfect in

cordially and aptly asfulkerson and march had ever done</s>  it amused the father to see his sonoffering fulkerson the same deference which the business end paidto seniority in march himself but in fact fulkersons forehead wasgetting as he said more intellectual every day and the years werepushing them all along together</s> still march had kept on in the old rut and one day he fell down in it</s> he had a long sickness and when he was well of it he was so slow ingetting his grip of work again that he was sometimes deeply discouraged</s> his wife shared his depression whether he showed or whether he hid itand when the doctor advised his going abroad she abetted the doctorwith all the strength of a womans hygienic intuitions</s>  march himselfwillingly consented at first but as soon

office the afternoon ofthat talk with the business end he wanted to laugh with his wife atfulkersons notion of a sabbatical year</s>  she did not think it was sovery droll she even urged it seriously

different ways and then she was reallysilent</s>  he perceived that she was hurt and he tried to win her back togoodhumor</s>  he asked her if she would not like to go over to hoboken andlook at one of the hanseatic league steamers some day and sherefused</s>  when he sent the next day and got a permit to see the boat sheconsented to go</s> iii</s> he was one of those men who live from the inside outward he often tooka hint for his actions from his fancies and now because he had fanciedsome people going to look at steamers on sundays he chose the nextsunday himself for their visit to the hanseatic boat at hoboken</s>  tobe sure it was a leisure day with him but he might have taken theafternoon of any other day for that matter and it was really thatinvisible thread of association which drew him</s> the colmannia had been in long enough to have made her toilet for theoutward voyage and was looking her best</s>  she was tipped and edgedwith shining brass without and within and was redcarpeted andwhitepainted as only a ship knows how to be</s>  a little uniformed stewardran before the visitors and showed them through the dim white corridorsinto typical staterooms on the different decks and then let themverify their first impression of the grandeur of the diningsaloon andthe luxury of the ladies parlor and musicroom</s>  march made his wifeobserve that the tables and sofas and easychairs which seemed socarelessly scattered about were all suggestively screwed fast to thefloor against rough weather and he amused himself with the heavy germanbrowns and greens and coppers in the decorations which he said musthave been studied in color from sausage beer and spinach to theeffect of those large marchpanes in the roof</s>  she laughed with him atthe tastelessness of the race which they were destined to marvel at moreand more but she made him own that the stewardesses whom they saw werecharmingly like servingmaids in the fliegende blatter when they wentashore she challenged his silence for some assent to her own conclusionthat the colmannia was perfect</s> she has only one fault he assented</s>  shes a ship</s> yes said his wife and i shall want to look at the norumbia before idecide</s> then he saw that it was only a question which steamer they should takeand not whether they should take any</s>  he explained at first gently andafterwards savagely that their visit to the colmannia was quite enoughfor him and that the vessel was not built that he would be willing tocross the atlantic in</s> when a man has gone so far as that he has committed himself to theopposite course in almost so many words and march was neither surprisednor abashed when he discovered himself before they reached homeoffering his wife many reasons why they should go to europe</s>  sheanswered to all no he had made her realize the horror of it so muchthat she was glad to give it up</s>  she gave it up with the best feelingall that she would ask of him was that he should never mention europe toher again</s>  she could imagine how much he disliked to go if such a shipas the colmannia did not make him want to go</s> at the bottom of his heart he knew that he had not used her very well</s> he had kindled her fancy with those notions of a sabbatical year and asilver wedding journey and when she was willing to renounce both hehad persisted in taking her to see the ship only to tell her afterwardsthat he would not go abroad on any account</s>  it was by a psychologicaljuggle which some men will understand that he allowed himself the nextday to get the sailings of the norumbia from the steamship office healso got a plan of the ship showing the most available staterooms sothat they might be able to choose between her and the colmannia from allthe facts</s> iv</s> from this time their decision to go was none the less explicit becauseso perfectly tacit</s> they began to amass maps and guides</s>  she got a baedeker for austria andhe got a bradshaw for the continent which was never of the least usethere but was for the present a mine of unavailable information</s>  hegot a phrasebook too and tried to rub up his german</s>  he used to

terms which theauthor of the phrasebook directed them to use he should not get onwith them beyond his first question but he did not allow this tospoil his pleasure in it</s>  in fact it was with a tender emotion that herealized how little the world which had changed in everything else sogreatly had changed in its ideal of a phrasebook</s> mrs</s>  march postponed the study of her baedeker to the time and place forit and addressed herself to the immediate business of ascertainingthe respective merits of the colmannia and norumbia</s>  she carried on herresearches solely among persons of her own sex its experiences werealone of that positive character which brings conviction and she valuedthem equally at first or second hand</s>  she heard of ladies who would notcross in any boat but the colmannia and who waited for months to get aroom on her she talked with ladies who said that nothing would inducethem to cross in her</s>  there were ladies who said she had twice themotion that the norumbia had and the vibration from her twin screwswas frightful it always was on those twinscrew boats and it didnot affect their testimony with mrs</s>  march that the norumbia was atwinscrew

against the most solemnassurances of their husbands fathers or brothers who might be allvery well on land but in navigation were not to be trusted they wouldsay anything from a reckless and culpable optimism</s>  she obligedmarch all the same to ask among them but she recognized their guiltyinsincerity when he came home saying that one man had told him you couldhave played croquet on the deck of the colmannia the whole way over whenhe crossed and another that he never saw the racks on in three passageshe had made in the norumbia</s> the weight of evidence was he thought in favor of the norumbia butwhen they went another sunday to hoboken and saw the ship mrs</s>  marchliked her so much less than the colmannia that she could hardly wait formonday to come she felt sure all the good rooms on the colmannia wouldbe gone before they could engage one</s> from a consensus of the nerves of all the ladies left in town so late inthe season she knew that the only place on any steamer

side you got the smell of the cooking</s> the only place really was just back of the diningsaloon on the southside of the ship it was smooth there and it was quiet and you had thesun in your window all the way over</s>  he asked her if he must take theirroom there or nowhere and she answered that he must do his best butthat she would not be satisfied with any other place</s> in his despair he went down to the steamer office and took a room whichone of the clerks said was the best</s>  when he got home it appeared fromreference to the ships plan that it was the very room his wife hadwanted

everybody knew it by this time but she said she had not hearda word of it and she went on with some felicitations which march foundrather unduly filial</s>  in getting a little past the prime of life he didnot like to be used with too great consideration of his years and hedid not think that he and his wife were so old that they need be treatedas if they were going on a golden wedding journey and heaped with allsorts of impertinent prophecies of their enjoying it so much andbeing so much the better for the little outing</s>  under his breath heconfounded this lady for her impudence but he schooled himself to lether rejoice at their going on a hanseatic boat because the germans werealways so careful of you</s>  she made her husband agree with her and itcame out that he had crossed several times on both the colmannia andthe norumbia</s>  he volunteered to say that the colmannia was a capitalseaboat she did not have her nose under water all the time she wassteady as a rock and

talkedof the big mailboat and said he would like to cross on such a boat asthat and then he glanced at the possible advantage of having your ownsteamyacht like the one which he said they had just

were cumberedwith handbags and rolls of shawls</s>  at an early hour after breakfastthe bedroom stewards began to get the steamer trunks out and pile themin the corridors the servants all became more caressingly attentiveand people who had left off settling the amount of the fees they weregoing to give anxiously conferred together</s>  the question whether youought ever to give the head steward anything pressed crucially at theearly lunch and kenby brought only a partial relief by saying that healways regarded the head steward as an officer of the ship</s>  march madethe experiment of offering him six marks and the head steward tookthem quite as if he were not an officer of the ship</s>  he also collected ahandsome fee for the music which is the tax levied on all german shipsbeyond the tolls exacted on the steamers of other nations</s> after lunch the flat shore at cuxhaven was so near that the summercottages of the little wateringplace showed through the warm drizzlemuch like the summer cottages of our own shore and if it had notbeen for the strange low sky the americans might easily have fanciedthemselves at home again</s> every one waited on foot while the tender came out into the streamwhere the norumbia had dropped anchor</s>  people who had brought theirhandbaggage with them from their rooms looked so much safer with itthat people who had left theirs to their

tentative types of cars</s> some were still the old coachbody carriages but most were of a strangecorridor arrangement with the aide at the aide and the seats crossingfrom it with compartments sometimes rising to the roof and sometimesrising halfway</s>  no two cars seemed quite alike but all were verycomfortable and when the train began to run out through the littleseaside town into the country the old delight of foreign travel began</s>
most of the houses were little and low and gray with ivy or floweringvines covering their walls to their browntiled roofs there was here andthere a touch of northern gothic in the architecture but usually whereit was pretentious it was in the mansard taste which was so bad with usa generation ago and is still very bad in cuxhaven</s> the fields flat and wide were dotted with familiar shapes of holsteincattle herded by little girls with their hair in yellow pigtails</s>  thegray stormy sky hung low and broke in fitful rains but perhaps forthe inclement season of midsummer it was not very cold</s>  flowers wereblooming along the embankments and in the rank green fields with adogged energy in the various distances were groups of treesembowering cottages and even villages and always along the ditches andwatercourses were double lines of low willows</s>
 at the first stop thetrain made the passengers flocked to the refreshmentbooth prettilyarranged beside the station where the abundance of the cherries andstrawberries gave proof that vegetation was in other respects superiorto the elements</s>  but it was not of the profusion of the sausages andthe ham which openly in slices or covertly in sandwiches claimed itsprimacy in the german affections every form of this was flanked by tallglasses of beer</s> a number of the natives stood by and stared unsmiling at the trainwhich had broken out in a rash of little american flags at every window</s> this boyish display which must have made the americans themselveslaugh if their sense of humor had not been lost in their impassionedpatriotism was the last expression of unity among the norumbiaspassengers and they met no more in their seasolidarity</s>  of their tableacquaintance the marches saw no one except burnamy who came through thetrain looking for them</s>  he said he was in

rooms for them at the hotel where he was going to stay withhim</s> after they reached hamburg they had flying glimpses of him and of othersin the odious rivalry to get their baggage examined first

against the generalfrenzy</s>  with the porter he secured march conspired and perspired to winthe attention of a cold but not unkindly inspector</s>  the officer openedone trunk and after a glance at it marked all as passed and then thereensued a heroic strife with the porter as to the pieces which were to goto the berlin station for their journey next day and the pieces whichwere to go to the hotel overnight</s>  at last the division was made themarches got into a cab of the first class and the porter crimson andsteaming at every pore from the physical and intellectual strain wentback into the station</s> they had got the number of their cab from the policeman who stands atthe door of all large german stations and supplies the traveller with ametallic check for the sort of vehicle he demands</s>  they were not proudbut it seemed best not to risk a secondclass cab in a strange city andwhen their firstclass cab came creaking and limping out of the rankthey saw how wise they had been if one of the second class could havebeen worse</s> as they rattled away from the station they saw yet another kind ofturnout which they were destined to see more and more in the germanlands</s>  it was that team of a woman harnessed with a dog to a cartwhich the women of no other country can see without a sense of personalinsult</s>  march tried to take the humorous view and complained that theyhad not been offered the choice of such an equipage by the policemanbut his wife would not be amused</s>  she said that no country whichsuffered such a thing could be truly civilized though he made herobserve that no city in the world except boston or brooklyn wasprobably so thoroughly trolleyed as hamburg</s>  the hum of the electric carwas everywhere and everywhere the shriek of the wires

basin of the elbe wherestately white swans were sailing and on the other to the new rathhausover the trees that deeply shaded the perennial mud of a cold dimpublic garden where waterproof old women

a thick substratum of cotton coverlet neatly buttonedinto the upper sheet with the effect of a portly waistcoat</s> the hotel was illumined by the kindly splendor of the uniformed portierwho had met the travellers at the door like a glowing vision of thepast and a friendly air diffused itself through the whole house</s>  atthe dinner which if not so cheap as they had somehow hoped was by nomeans bad they took counsel with the englishspeaking waiter as to whatentertainment hamburg could offer for the evening and by the timethey had drunk their coffee they had courage for the circus renz whichseemed to be all there was</s> the conductor of the trolleycar which they hailed at the streetcorner stopped it and got off the platform and stood in the streetuntil they were safely aboard without telling them to step lively orpulling them up the steps or knuckling them in the back to make themmove forward</s>  he let them get fairly seated before he started the carand so lost the fun

environed them went far to alleviate theinclemency of the climate it began to rain as soon as they left theshelter of the car but a citizen of whom they asked the nearest way tothe circus renz was so

possession ofthe circus renz</s> in the audience she had seen german officers for the first time inhamburg and she meant if unremitting question could bring out thetruth to know why she had not met any others</s>  she had read much of theprevalence and prepotence of the german officers who would try to pushher off the sidewalk till they realized that she was an american womanand would then submit to her inflexible purpose of holding it</s>  but shehad been some seven or eight hours in hamburg and nothing of the kindhad happened to her perhaps because she had hardly yet walked a blockin

friend who came in to see the marches at breakfast</s>  he saidhamburg had been so long a free republic that the presence of a largeimperial garrison was distasteful to the people and as a matter of factthere were very few soldiers quartered there whether the authoritieschose to indulge the popular grudge or not</s>  he was himself in a joyfulflutter of spirits for he had just the day before got his release frommilitary service</s>  he gave them a notion of what the rapture of a manreprieved from death might be and he was as radiantly happy in theill health which had got him his release as if it had been the greatestblessing of heaven</s>  he bubbled over with smiling regrets that he shouldbe leaving his home for the first stage of the journey which he was totake in search of strength just as they had come and he pressed themto say if there were not something that he could do for them</s> yes said mrs</s>  march with a promptness surprising to her husband whocould think of nothing tell us where heinrich heine lived when he wasin hamburg</s>  my husband has always had a great passion for him and wantsto look him up everywhere</s> march had forgotten that heine ever lived in hamburg and the young manhad apparently never known it</s>  his face fell he wished to make mrs</s> march believe that it was only heines uncle who had lived there butshe was firm and when he had asked among the hotel people he cameback gladly owning that he was wrong and that the poet used to live inkonigstrasse which was very near by and where they could easily knowthe house by his bust set in its front</s>  the portier and the head waitershared his ecstasy in so easily obliging the friendly american pair andjoined him in minutely instructing the driver when they shut them intotheir carriage</s> they did not know that his was almost the only laughing face they shouldsee in the serious german empire just as they did not know that itrained there every day</s>  as they drove off in the gray drizzle with theunfounded hope that sooner or later the weather would be fine they badetheir driver be very slow in taking them through konigstrasse so thathe should by no means miss heines dwelling and he duly stopped infront of a house bearing the promised bust</s>  they dismounted in order torevere it more at their ease but the bust proved by an irony bittererthan the sick heartbreaking brilliant jew could have imagined in hiscruelest moment to be that of the german milton the respectable poetklopstock whom heine abhorred and mocked so pitilessly</s> in fact it was here that the good muchforgotten klopstock dweltwhen he came home to live with a comfortable pension from the danishgovernment and the pilgrims to the mistaken shrine went asking aboutamong the neighbors

fraudulent shrine got back into their carriage anddrove sadly away instructing their driver with the rigidity which theirlimited german favored not to let any house with a bust in its frontescape him</s>  he promised and took his course out through konigstrasseand suddenly they found themselves in a world of such eld and quaintnessthat they forgot heine as completely as any of his countrymen had done</s> they were in steep and narrow streets that crooked and turned with noapparent purpose of leading anywhere among houses that looked down uponthem with an astonished stare from the leadensashed windows of theirtimberlaced gables</s>  the facades with their lattices stretching inbands quite across them and with their steep roofs climbing highin successions of blinking dormers were more richly mediaeval thananything the travellers had ever dreamt of before and they feastedthemselves upon the unimagined picturesqueness with a leisurelyminuteness which brought responsive gazers everywhere to the windowswindows were set ajar shop doors were darkened by curious figures fromwithin and the traffic of the tortuous alleys was interrupted by theirprogress</s>  they could not have said which delighted them morethehouses in the immediate foreground or the sharp high gables in theperspectives and the background but all were like the painted scenesof the stage and they had a pleasant difficulty in realizing that theywere not persons in some romantic drama</s> the illusion remained with them and qualified the impression whichhamburg made by her muchtrolleyed bostonian effect by the decorousactivity and parisian architecture of her business streets by theturmoil of her quays and the innumerable masts and chimneys of hershipping</s>  at the heart of all was that quaintness that picturesquenessof the past which embodied the spirit of the old hanseatic city andseemed the expression of the homeside of her history</s>  the sense of thisgained strength from such slight study of her annals as they afterwardsmade and assisted the digestion of some morsels of tough statistics</s>  inthe shadow of those gothic houses the fact that hamburg was one ofthe greatest coffee marts and money marts of the world had a romanticglamour and the fact that in the four years from 1870 till 1874 aquarter of a million emigrants sailed on her ships for the unitedstates seemed to stretch a nerve of kindred feeling from those mediaevalstreets through the whole shabby length of third avenue</s> it was perhaps in this glamour or this feeling of commercialsolidarity that march went to have a look at the hamburg bourse in thebeautiful new rathhaus</s>  it was not undergoing repairs it was too newfor that but it was in construction and so it fulfilled the functionof a public edifice in withholding its entire interest from thestranger</s>  he could not get into the senate chamber but the bourse wasfree to him and when he stepped within it rose at him with a roar ofvoices and of feet like the new york stock exchange</s>  the spectacle wasnot so frantic people were not shaking their fists or fingers in eachothers noses but they were all wild in the tamer german way andhe was glad to mount from the bourse to the poor little art galleryupstairs and to shut out its clamor</s>  he was not so glad when he lookedround on these his first examples of modern german art</s>  the custodianled him gently about and said which things were for sale and it madehis heart ache to see how bad they were and to think that bad as theywere he could not buy any of them</s> xxii</s> in the start from cuxhaven the passengers had the irresponsible ease ofpeople ticketed through and the steamship company had still the chargeof their baggage</s>  but when the marches left hamburg for leipsic wherethey had decided to break the long pull to carlsbad all the anxietiesof european travel dimly remembered from former european days offeredthemselves for recognition</s>  a porter vanished with their handbaggagebefore they could note any trait in him for identification otherporters made away with their trunks and the interpreter who helpedmarch buy his tickets with a vocabulary of strictly railroad englishhad to help him find the pieces in the baggageroom curiously estrangedin a mountain of alien boxes</s>  one official weighed them another obligedhim to pay as much in freight as for a third passenger and gave him anillegible scrap of paper which recorded their number and destination</s> the interpreter and the porters took their fees with a professionaleffect of dissatisfaction and he went to wait with his wife amidst thesmoking and eating and drinking in the restaurant</s>  they burst throughwith the rest when the doors were opened to the train and followed aglimpse of the porter with their handbags as he ran down the platformstill bent upon escaping them and brought him to bay at last in a carwhere he had got very good seats for them and sank into their placeshot and humiliated by their needless tumult</s> as they cooled they recovered their selfrespect and renewed ayouthful joy in some of the longestranged facts</s>  the road was rougherthan the roads at home but for much less money they had the comfortwithout the unavailing splendor of a pullman in their secondclasscarriage</s>  mrs</s>  march had expected to be used with the severity on theimperial railroads which she had failed to experience from the militaryon the hamburg sidewalks but nothing could be kindlier than the wholemanagement toward her</s>  her fellowtravellers were not lavish of theirrights as americans are what they got that they kept and in the runfrom hamburg to leipsic she had several occasions to observe that nogerman however young or robust dreams of offering a better place ifhe has one to a lady in grace to her sex or age if they got into acarriage too late to secure a forwardlooking seat she rode backward tothe end of that stage</s>  but if they appealed to their fellowtravellersfor information about changes or stops or any of the little facts thatthey wished to make sure of they were enlightened past possibility oferror</s>  at the point where they might have gone wrong the explanationswere renewed with a thoughtfulness which showed that their anxieties hadnot been forgotten</s>  she said she could not see how any people could beboth so selfish and so sweet and her husband seized the advantage ofsaying something offensiveyou women are so pampered in america that you are astonished when youare treated in europe like the mere human beings you are</s> she answered with unexpected reasonablenessyes theres something in that but when the germans have taught ushow despicable we are as women why do they treat us so well as humanbeings</s> this was at ten oclock after she had ridden backward a long way andat last within an hour of leipsic had got a seat confronting him</s>  thedarkness had now hidden the landscape but the impression of its fewsimple elements lingered pleasantly in their sense long levels denselywooded with the precise severely disciplined german forests andcheckered with fields of grain and grass soaking under the thin rainthat from time to time varied the thin sunshine</s> the villages and peasants cottages were notably few but there washere and there a classic or a gothic villa which at one point anenglishspeaking young lady turned from her tauchnitz novel to explainas the seat of some country gentleman the land was in large holdingsand this accounted for the sparsity of villages and cottages</s> she then said that she was a german teacher of english in hamburg andwas going home to potsdam for a visit</s>  she seemed like a german girlout of the initials and in return for this favor mrs</s>  march tried toinvest herself with some romantic interest as an american</s>  she failedto move the girls fancy even after she had bestowed on her an immensebunch of roses which the young german friend in hamburg had sent to themjust before they left their hotel</s>  she failed later on the same groundwith the pleasantlooking english woman who got into their carriageat magdeburg and talked over the london illustrated news with anenglishspeaking fraulein in her company she readily accepted thefact of mrs</s>  marchs nationality but found nothing wonderful

into ohs and ahs bysaying that she was an american and telling how far she had come acrossthe sea</s> yes march assented but that was a great while ago and americanswere much rarer than they are now

isliving here with her german husband i fancied she had married rank</s>  icould imagine how dull it must be in her little saxon town from theway she clung to her illustrated news and explained the pictures of theroyalties to her friend</s>  there is romance for you</s> they arrived at leipsic fresh and cheerful after their five hoursjourney and as in a spell of their travelled youth they drove upthrough the academic old town asleep under its dimly clouded sky andsilent except for the trolleycars that prowled its streets with theirfeline purr and broke at times into a long shrill caterwaul</s>  a senseof the past imparted itself to the wellknown encounter with the portierand the head waiter at the hotel door to the payment of the driver tothe endeavor of the secretary to have them take the most expensive roomsin the house and to his compromise upon the next most where they foundthemselves in great comfort with electric lights and bells and a quicksuccession of feetaking callboys in dresscoats too large for them</s> the spell was deepened by the fact which march kept at the bottom ofhis consciousness for the present that one of their trunks was missing</s> this linked him more closely to the travel of other days and he spentthe next forenoon in a telegraphic search for the estray with emotionstinged by the melancholy of recollection but in the security thatsince it was somewhere in the keeping of the state railway it would befinally restored to him</s> xxiii</s> their windows as they saw in the morning looked into a large squareof aristocratic physiognomy and of a parisian effect in architecturewhich afterwards proved characteristic of the town if not quite socharacteristic as to justify the passion of leipsic for calling itselflittle paris</s>  the prevailing tone was of a gray tending to the paleyellow of the tauchnitz editions with which the place is more familiarlyassociated in the minds of englishspeaking travellers</s>  it was rathermore sombre than it might have been if the weather had been fair buta quiet rain was falling dreamily that morning and the square wasprovided with a fountain which continued to dribble in the rare momentswhen the rain forgot itself</s>  the place was better shaded than need bein that sunless land by the german elms that look like ours and it wassufficiently stocked with german statues that look like no others</s>  ithad a monument too of the sort with which german art has everywheredisfigured the kindly fatherland since the war with france</s>  thesemonuments though they are so very ugly have a sort of pathos asrecords of the only war in which germany unaided has triumphed againsta foreign foe but they are as tiresome as all such memorial pomps mustbe</s>  it is not for the victories of a people that any other people cancare</s>  the wars come and go in blood and tears but whether they are badwars or what are comically called good wars they are of one effect indeath and sorrow and their fame is an offence to all men not concernedin them till time has softened it to a memory of old unhappy faroff things and battles long ago</s> it was for some such reason that while the marches turned with instantsatiety from the swelling and strutting sculpture which celebrated theleipsic heroes of the war of 1870 they had heart for those of the warof 1813 and after their noonday dinner they drove willingly in a pauseof the rain out between yellowing harvests of wheat and oats to thefield where napoleon was beaten by the russians austrians and prussiansit always took at least three nations to beat the little wretchfourscore years before</s>  yet even there mrs</s>  march was really moreconcerned for the sparsity of cornflowers in the grain which in theirmodern character of kaiserblumen she found strangely absent from theirloyal function and march was more taken with the notion of the littlegardens which his guide told him the citizens could have in the suburbsof leipsic and enjoy at any trolleycar distance from their homes</s> he saw certain of these gardens in groups divided by low unenviousfences and sometimes furnished with summerhouses where the tenantcould take his pleasure in the evening air with his family</s>  the guidesaid he had such a garden himself at a rent of seven dollars a yearwhere he raised vegetables and flowers and spent his peaceful leisureand march fancied that on the simple domestic side of their life whichthis fact gave him a glimpse of the germans were much more engagingthan in their character of victors over either the first or the thirdnapoleon</s>  but probably they would not have agreed with him and probablynations will go on making themselves cruel and tiresome till humanity atlast prevails over nationality</s> he could have put the case to the guide himself but though the guidewas imaginably liberated to a cosmopolitan conception of things bythree years service as waiter in english hotels where he learned thelanguage he might not have risen to this</s>  he would have tried for hewas a willing and kindly soul though he was not a valet de place byprofession</s>  there seemed in fact but one of that useless and amusingrace which is everywhere falling into decay through the rivalry of theperfected baedeker left in leipsic and this one was engaged so thatthe marches had to devolve upon their exwaiter who was now the keeperof a small restaurant</s>  he gladly abandoned his business to the care ofhis wife in order to drive handsomely about in his best clothes withstrangers who did not exact too much knowledge from him</s>  in his zealto do something he possessed himself of marchs overcoat when theydismounted at their first gallery and let fall from its pocket hisprophylactic flask of brandy which broke with a loud crash on themarble floor in the presence of several masterpieces and perfumed thewhole place</s>  the masterpieces were some excellent works of luke kranachwho seemed the only german painter worth looking at when there were anydutch or italian pictures near but the travellers forgot the name andnature of the kranachs and remembered afterwards only the shatteredfragments of the brandyflask just how they looked on the floor andthe fumes how they smelt that rose from the ruin</s> it might have been a warning protest of the veracities against what theywere doing but the madness of sightseeing which spoils travel wason them and they delivered themselves up to it as they used in theirignorant youth though now they knew its futility so well</s>  they sparedthemselves nothing that they had time for that day and they feltfalsely guilty for their omissions as if they really had been dutiesto art and history which must be discharged like obligations to onesmaker and ones neighbor</s> they had a touch of genuine joy in the presence of the beautiful oldrathhaus and they were sensible of something like a genuine emotion inpassing the famous and venerable university the very air of leipsicis redolent of printing and publication which appealed to march in hisquality of editor and they could not fail of an impression of the quietbeauty of the town with its regular streets of houses breaking intosuburban villas of an american sort and intersected with many canalswhich in the intervals of the rain were eagerly navigated by pleasureboats and contributed to the general picturesqueness by their frequentbridges even during the drizzle</s>  there seemed to be no churches to doand as it was a sunday the galleries were so early closed against themthat they were making a virtue as well as a pleasure of the famous sceneof napoleons first great defeat</s> by a concert between their guide and driver their carriage drew up atthe little inn by the roadside which is also a museum stocked withrelics from the battlefield and with objects of interest relating toit</s>  old muskets old swords old shoes and old coats trumpets drumsguncarriages wheels helmets cannon balls grapeshot and all themurderous rubbish which battles come to at last with proclamationsautographs caricatures and likenesses of napoleon and effigies ofall the other generals engaged and miniatures and jewels of theirwomenkind filled room after room through which their owner vaunted hisway with a loud pounding voice and a bad breath</s>  when he wished themto enjoy some gross british satire or clumsy german gibe at bonapartesexpense and put his face close to begin the laugh he was somethingso terrible that march left the place with a profound if not a reasonedregret that the french had not won the battle of leipsic</s>  he walkedaway musing pensively upon the travellers inadequacy to the ethics ofhistory when a breath could so sway him against his convictions buteven after he had cleansed his lungs with some deep respirations hefound himself still a bonapartist in the presence of that stone onthe rising ground where napoleon sat to watch the struggle on the vastplain and see his empire slipping through his bloodstained fingers</s> it was with difficulty that he could keep from revering the hat and coatwhich are sculptured on the stone but it was well that he succeededfor he could not make out then or afterwards whether the habilimentsrepresented were really napoleons or not and they might have turnedout to be barclay de tollys</s> while he stood trying to solve this question of clothes he was startledby the apparition of a man climbing the little slope from the oppositequarter and advancing toward them</s>  he wore the imperial crossed by thepointed mustache once so familiar to a world much the worse for themand march had the shiver of a fine moment in which he fancied the thirdnapoleon rising to view the scene

upon each other and encountered with a kiss</s>  at the same timethe visage of the last emperor resolved itself into the face of generaltriscoe who gave march his hand in a more tempered greeting</s> the ladies began asking each other of their lives since their partingtwo days before and the men strolled a few paces away toward thedistant prospect of leipsic which at that point silhouettes itself in anoble stretch of roofs and spires and towers against the horizon</s> general triscoe seemed no better satisfied with germany than he had beenon first stepping ashore at cuxhaven</s>  he might still have been in a poutwith his own country but as yet he had not made up with any other andhe said what a pity napoleon didnt thrash the whole dunderheaded lot</s> his empire would have been a

him uponmany features of german civilization but chiefly upon the treatment ofwomen in it and upon this his philosopher was less satisfactory thanhe could have wished him to be</s>  he tried to excuse

they fell to the ground when she nowrose from breakfast and she stooped to pick them up</s>  miss triscoe wastoo quick for her</s> oh let me carry them for you</s>  she entreated and after a

terms to the manager that he conceivedof him as a brother artist</s>  this led to much bowing and smiling fromthe manager when the marches met him in the street or in their frequentvisits to the theatre with which march felt that it might well haveended and still been far beyond his desert</s>  he had not thought of goingto the opera on the emperors birthnight but after dinner a box camefrom the manager and mrs</s>  march agreed with him that they could not indecency accept so great a favor</s>  at the same time she argued that theycould not in decency refuse it and that to show their sense of thepleasure done them they must adorn their box with all the beautyand distinction possible in other words she said they must ask misstriscoe and her father</s> and why not major eltwin and his wife</s>  or mrs</s>  adding and rose</s> she begged him simply in his own interest not to be foolish and theywent early so as to be in their box when their guests came</s>  thefoyer of the theatre was banked with flowers and against a curtain ofevergreens stood a highpedestalled bust of the paternal caesar withwhose sidewhiskers a laurel crown comported itself as well as it could</s> at the foot of the grand staircase leading to the boxes the managerstood in evening dress receiving his friends and their felicitationsupon the honor which the theatre was sure to do itself on an occasion soaugust</s>  the marches were so cordial in their prophecies that the manageryielded to an artists impulse and begged his fellowartist to do himthe pleasure of coming behind the scenes between the acts of the operahe bowed a heartfelt regret to mrs</s>  march that he could not make theinvitation include her and hoped that she would not be too lonely whileher husband was gone</s> she explained that they had asked friends and she should not be aloneand then he entreated march to bring any gentleman who was his guestwith him</s>  on the way up to their box she pressed his arm as she used intheir young married days and asked him if it was not perfect</s>  i wishwe were going to have it all to ourselves no one else can appreciatethe whole situation</s>  do you think we have made a mistake in having thetriscoes</s> we</s>  he retorted</s>  oh thats good</s>  im going to shirk him when itcomes to going behind the scenes</s> no no dearest she entreated</s>  snubbing will only make it worse</s>  wemust stand it to the bitter end now</s> the curtain rose upon another laurelled bust of the emperor with achorus of men formed on either side who broke into the grave and noblestrains of the austrian hymn while every one stood</s>  then the curtainfell again and in the interval before the opera could begin generaltriscoe and his daughter came in</s> mrs</s>  march took the splendor in which the girl appeared as a tribute toher hospitality</s>  she had hitherto been a little disappointed of the openhomage to american girlhood which her readings of international romancehad taught her to expect in europe but now her patriotic vanity feastedfull</s>  fat highhotes of her own sex levelled their lorgnettes at misstriscoe all around the horseshoe with critical glances which fellblunted from her complexion and costume the house was brilliantwith the military uniforms which we have not yet to mingle with ourunrivalled millinery and the ardent gaze of the young officers dwelt onthe perfect mould of her girlish arms and neck and the winning lines ofher face</s>  the girls eyes shone with a joyful excitement and her littlehead defined by its dark hair trembled as she slowly turned it fromside to side after she removed the airy scarf which had covered it</s> her father in evening dress looked the third emperor complaisant toa civil occasion and took a chair in the front of the box withoutresistance and the ladies disputed which should yield the best placeto the other till miss triscoe forced mrs</s>  march fondly into it for thefirst act at least</s> the piece had to be cut a good deal to give people time for theilluminations afterwards but as it was it gave scope to the actresswho als gast from a viennese theatre was the chief figure in it</s>  shemerited the distinction by the art which still lingered deeply embeddedin her massive balk but never wholly obscured</s> that is grand isnt it</s>  said march following one of the tremendousstrokes by which she overcame her physical disadvantages</s>  its fineto see how her art can undo for one splendid instant the work ofall those steins of beer those illimitable licks of sausage thoseboundless fields of cabbage</s>  but its rather pathetic</s> its disgusting said his wife and at this general triscoe whohad been watching the actress through his lorgnette said as if hiscontrarymindedness were irresistibly invokedwell i dont know</s>  its amusing</s>  do you suppose we shall see her whenwe go behind march</s> he still professed a desire to do so when the curtain fell and theyhurried to the rear door of the theatre</s>  it was slightly ajar and theypulled it wide open with the eagerness of their age and nation andbegan to mount the stairs leading up from it between rows of painteddancinggirls who had come out for a breath of air and who pressedthemselves against the walls to make room for the intruders</s>  with theirrouged faces and the stare of their glassy eyes intensified by thecoloring of their brows and lashes they were like painted statues asthey stood there with their crimsoned lips parted in astonished smiles</s> this is rather weird said march faltering at the sight</s>  i wonderif we might ask these young ladies where to go</s>  general triscoe made noanswer and was apparently no more prepared than himself to accost thefiles of danseuses when they were themselves accosted by an angry voicefrom the head of the stairs with a demand for their business</s>  the voicebelonged to a gendarme who descended toward them and seemed as deeplyscandalized at their appearance as they could have been at that of theyoung ladies</s> march explained in his ineffective german with every effect ofimprobability that they were there by appointment of the manager andwished to find his room</s> the gendarme would not or could not make anything out of it</s>  he presseddown upon them and laying a rude hand on a shoulder of either beganto force them back to the door</s>  the mild nature of the editor might haveyielded to his violence but the martial spirit of general triscoe wasroused</s>  he shrugged the gendarmes hand from his shoulder and with avoice as furious as his own required him in english to say what thedevil he meant</s>  the gendarme rejoined with equal heat in german thegenerals tone rose in anger the dancinggirls emitted some littleshrieks of alarm and fled noisily up the stairs</s>  from time to timemarch interposed with a word of the german which had mostly desertedhim in his hour of need but if it had been a flow of intelligibleexpostulation it would have had no effect upon the disputants</s>  theygrew more outrageous till the manager himself appeared at the head ofthe stairs and extended an arresting hand over the hubbub</s>  as soon asthe situation clarified itself he hurried down to his visitors with apolite roar of apology and rescued them from the gendarme and ledthem up to his room and forced them into armchairs with a rapidity ofreparation which did not exhaust itself till he had entreated them withevery circumstance of civility to excuse an incident so mortifying tohim</s>  but with all his haste he lost so much time in this that he hadlittle left to show them through the theatre and their presentation tothe prima donna was reduced to the obeisances with which they met andparted as she went upon the stage at the lifting of the curtain</s>  inthe lack of a common language this was perhaps as well as a longerinterview and nothing could have been more honorable than theirdismissal at the hands of the gendarme who had received them sostormily</s>  he opened the door for them and stood with his fingers to hiscap saluting in the effect of being a whole file of grenadiers</s> xliii</s> at the same moment burnamy bowed himself out of the box where he hadbeen sitting with the ladies during the absence of the gentlemen</s>  he hadknocked at the door almost as soon as they disappeared and if he didnot fully share the consternation which his presence caused he lookedso frightened that mrs</s>  march reserved the censure which the sight ofhim inspired and in default of other inspiration treated his comingsimply as a surprise</s>  she shook hands with him and then she asked himto sit down and listened to his explanation that he had come back tocarlsbad to write up the birthnight festivities on an order from theparisnew york chronicle that he had seen them in the box and hadventured to took in</s>  he was pale and so discomposed that the heart ofjustice was softened more and more in mrs</s>  marchs breast and she lefthim to the talk that sprang up by an admirable effect of tact in theyoung lady between him and miss triscoe</s> after all she decided there was nothing criminal in his being incarlsbad and possibly in the last analysis there was nothing so verywicked in his being in her box</s>  one might say that it was not very niceof him after he had gone away under such a cloud but on the other handit was nice though in a different way if he longed so much to see misstriscoe that he could not help coming</s>  it was altogether in his favorthat he was so agitated though he was momently becoming less agitatedthe young people were beginning to laugh at the notion of mr</s>  march andgeneral triscoe going behind the scenes</s>  burnamy said he envied them thechance and added not very relevantly that he had come from baireuthwhere he had seen the last of the wagner performances</s>  he said he wasgoing back to baireuth but not to ansbach again where he had finishedlooking up that kaspar hauser business</s>  he seemed to think mrs</s>  marchwould know about it and she could not help saying oh yes mr</s>  marchwas so much interested</s>  she wondered if she ought to tell him about hishandkerchief but she remembered in time that she had left it in misstriscoes keeping</s>  she wondered if the girl realized how handsome hewas</s>  he was extremely handsome in his black evening dress with histuxedo and the pallor of his face repeated in his expanse of shirtfront</s> at the bell for the rising of the curtain he rose too and took theiroffered hands</s>  in offering hers mrs</s>  march asked if he would not stayand speak with mr</s>  march and the general and now for the first time herecognized anything clandestine in his visit</s>  he laughed nervously andsaid no thank you</s>  and shut himself out</s> we must tell them said mrs</s>  march rather interrogatively and shewas glad that the girl answered with a note of indignation</s> why certainly mrs</s>  march</s> they could not tell them at once for the second act had begun whenmarch and the general came back and after the opera was over and theygot out into the crowded street there was no chance for the general wasobliged to offer his arm to mrs</s>  march while her husband followed withhis daughter</s> the facades of the theatre and of the hotels

they respondeddocilely to the entreaties of the policemen who stood on the stepsof the bridges and divided their encountering currents with patientappeals of bitte schon</s>  bitte schon</s>  he laughed to think of a new yorkcop saying please prettily</s>  please prettily</s>  to a new york crowd whichhe wished to have go this way or that and then he burned with shame tothink how far our manners were from civilization wherever our heads andhearts might be when he heard a voice at his elbowa punch with a club would start some of these fellows along quicker</s> it was stoller and march turned from him to lose his disgust in thesudden terror of perceiving that miss triscoe was no longer at his side</s> neither could he see his wife and general triscoe and he began topush frantically about in the crowd looking for the girl</s>  he had aninterminable five or ten minutes in his vain search and he was goingto call out to her by name when burnamy saved him from the hopelessabsurdity by elbowing his way to him with miss</s>  triscoe on his arm</s> here she is mr</s>  march he said as if there were nothing strange inhis having been there to find her in fact he had followed them

in hisbewilderment burnamy was gone again the girl offered no explanationfor him and march had not yet decided to ask any when he caught sightof his wife and general triscoe standing tiptoe in a doorway and craningtheir necks upward and forward to scan the crowd in search of him andhis charge</s>  then he looked round at her and opened his lips to expressthe astonishment that filled him when

as it should be it was as it would be at home and yet inthis ancient city where the past was so much alive in the perpetualpicturesqueness the marches felt an incongruity in it and they werefain to

kindly and peaceable they only knifed each otherquietly on sunday evenings after having too much beer</s> presently the stranger rose and bowed to the marches for goodby andas he walked down the aisle of trees in which they had been fittingtogether he seemed to be retreating farther and farther from suchamericanism as they had in common</s>  he had reverted to an entirely germaneffect of dress and figure his walk was slow and teutonic he must be atype of thousands who have returned to the fatherland without wishingto own themselves its children again and yet out of heart with the onlycountry left them</s> he was rather pathetic my dear said march in the discomfort he knewhis wife must be feeling as well as himself</s>  how odd to have the lidlifted here and see the same old problems

theyre still as charming</s> oh no she returned nothing is as charming as it used to be</s>  andnow we need the charm more than ever</s> he laughed at her despair in the tacit understanding they had livedinto that only one of them was to be desperate at a time and that theywere to take turns in cheering each other up</s>  well perhaps we dontdeserve it</s>  and im not sure that we need it so much

altogether of the purpose with which hebegan and they took the trolley back to their hotel cheerful in theintrepid fancy that they had confronted fate when they had only had thehardihood to face a

with drivers in the royal bavarianblue trooping by in the cold small rain impassibly dripping from theirglazed hatbrims upon their uniforms</s>  but he could not feel that thesethings were any of them very poignantly significant and he coveredhis retreat from the actualities of nuremberg by visiting the chiefbookstore and buying more photographs of the architecture than hewanted and more local

affair by nine chances out often could not fail to eventuate at the best in a marriage as tiresomeas most other marriages and yet she was abandoning herself withthose ignorant young people to the

was</s> in fact it was somewhat accidental ansbach was near nuremberg it wasnot much out of the way to holland</s>  they took more and more credit tothemselves for a reasoned and definite motive in the light of theircompanions enthusiasm for the place and its charm began for them withthe drive from the station through streets whose sentiment was bothitalian and french and where there was a yellowish cast in the grayof the architecture which was almost mantuan</s>  they rested theirsensibilities so bruised and fretted by gothic angles and pointsagainst the smooth surfaces of the prevailing classicistic facades ofthe houses as they passed and when they arrived at their hotel an oldmansion of versailles type fronting on a long irregular square plantedwith pollard sycamores they said that it might as well have been lucca</s> the archway and stairway of the hotel were draped with the bavariancolors and they were obscurely flattered to learn that prince leopoldthe brother of

hotel the princes officers were afterwardsabout in the corridors and on the stairs but they offered no shadow ofobstruction to her going and coming and the landlord himself was not sopreoccupied with

keeping withthe versailles ideal of a resident</s>  in the rear and elsewhere at fitdistance from its courts a native architecture prevailed and at nogreat remove the marches found themselves in a simple german town again</s> there they stumbled upon a little booksellers shop blinking in a quietcorner and bought three or four guides and small histories of ansbachwhich they carried home and studied between drowsing and waking</s>  thewonderful german syntax seems at its most enigmatical in this sortof literature and sometimes they lost themselves in its labyrinthscompletely and only made their way perilously out with the help ofcumulative declensions past articles and adjectives blindly seekingtheir nouns to longprocrastinated verbs dancing like swampfires inthe distance</s>  they emerged a little less ignorant than they went in andbetter qualified than they would otherwise have been for their secondvisit to the schloss which they paid early the next morning</s> they were so early indeed that when they mounted from the great innercourt much too big for ansbach if not for the building and rung thecustodians bell a smiling maid who let them into an anteroom whereshe kept on

any hensparrow who had built her nest in some coign ofits architecture and her friendly peaceful domesticity remained awholesome human background to the tragedies and comedies of the pastand held them in a picturesque relief in which they were alike tolerableand even charming</s> the history of ansbach strikes its roots in the soil of fable and aboveground is a gnarled and twisted growth of good and bad from the timeof the great charles to the time of the great frederick</s>  between thesetimes she had her various rulers ecclesiastical and secular in variousforms of vassalage to the empire but for nearly four centuriesher sovereignty was in the hands of the margraves who reigned in aconstantly increasing splendor till the last sold her outright to theking of prussia in 1791 and went to

best margrave in spite of thedefects of his qualities</s>  he was the son of the wild margrave equallyknown in the ansbach annals who may not have been the worst margravebut who had certainly a bad trick of putting his subjects to deathwithout trial and in cases where there was special haste with his ownhand</s>  he sent his son to the university at utrecht because he believedthat the republican influences in holland would be wholesome for himand then he sent him to travel in italy but when the boy camehome looking frail and sick the wild margrave charged his officialtravelling companion with neglect and had the unhappy hofrath meyerhanged without process for this crime</s>  one of the gentlemen of hisrealm for a pasquinade on the margrave was brought to the scaffold hehad at various times

you will sleep sweeter tonight for not having heardmy pistols an hour sooner</s> from this it appears that the gracious lord had his moments of regretbut perhaps it is not altogether strange that when he died the wholepopulation stormed through the streets to meet his funeral train notin awestricken silence to meditate on the fall of human grandeur butto unite in an eager tumult of rejoicing as if some cruel brigand whohad long held the city in terror were delivered over to them bound andin chains</s>  for nearly thirty years this bloodstained miscreant hadreigned over his hapless people in a sovereign plenitude of power whichby the theory of german imperialism in our day is still a divine right</s> they called him the wild margrave in their instinctive revolt fromthe belief that any man not untamably savage could be guilty of hisatrocities and they called his son the last margrave with a touchof the poetry which perhaps records a regret for their extinction as astate</s>  he did not harry them as his father had done his mild rule wasthe effect partly of the indifference and distaste for his country bredby his long sojourns abroad but doubtless also it was the effect of akindly nature</s>  even in the matter of selling a few thousands of them tofight the battles of a bad cause on the other side of the world he hadthe best of motives and faithfully applied the proceeds to the paymentof the state debt and the embellishment of the capital</s> his mother was a younger sister of frederick the great and was soconstantly at war with her husband that probably she had nothing to

brilliantand disdainful english lady who replaced this poor tragic muse inthe margraves heart though the lady herself lived to be the lastmargravine of ansbach where everybody seems to have hated her with apassion which she doubtless knew how to return</s>  she was the daughterof the earl of berkeley and the wife of lord craven a sufficientlyunfaithful and unworthy nobleman by her account from

actresses only stab themselves under theirsleeves</s> she drove clairon from ansbach and the great tragedienne returned toparis where she remained true to her false friend and from timeto time wrote him letters full of magnanimous counsel and generoustenderness</s>  but she could not have been so good company as lady cravenwho was a very gifted person and knew how to compose songs and singthem and write comedies and play them and who could keep the margraveamused in many ways</s>  when his loveless and childless wife died hemarried the english woman but he grew more and more weary of his dulllittle court and his dull little country and after a while consideringthe uncertain tenure sovereigns had of their heads since the french kinghad lost his and the fact that he had no heirs to

satwith march at their soup he asked if she were not well</s> march explained and he provisionally invented some regrets from herthat she should not see kenby till supper</s> kenby ordered a bottle of one of the famous wurzburg wines for theirmutual consolation in her absence and in the friendliness which itspromoted they agreed to spend the afternoon together</s>  no man is soinveterate a husband as not to take kindly an occasional release tobachelor companionship and before the dinner was over they agreed thatthey would go to the volksfest and get some notion of the popular lifeand amusements

they met detachments of soldiers everywhere infantryartillery cavalry</s> this is going to be a great show kenby said meaning the manoeuvresand he added as if now he had kept away from the subject

together</s>  she wouldnt have half the attraction withouthim</s> oh yes march assented</s>  he had often wondered how a man wishing tomarry a widow managed with the idea of her children by another marriagebut if kenby was honest it was much simpler than he had supposed</s>  hecould not say this to him however and in a certain embarrassment hehad with the conjecture in his presence he attempted a diversion</s>  werepromised something at the volksfest which will be a great novelty tous as americans</s>  our driver told us this morning that one of the housesthere was built entirely of wood</s> when they reached the grounds of the volksfest this civil feature ofthe great military event at hand which the marches had found largelyset forth in the programme of the parade did not fully keep the glowingpromises made for it in fact it could not easily have done so</s>  it wasin a pleasant neighborhood of new villas such as form the modern quarterof every german city and the volksfest was even more unfinished thanits environment</s>  it was not yet enclosed by the fence which was to hideits wonders from the nonpaying public but march and kenby went inthrough an archway where the gatemoney was as effectually collectedfrom them as if they were barred every other entrance</s> the wooden building was easily distinguishable from the other edificesbecause these were tents and booths still less substantial</s>  they did notmake out its function but of the others four sheltered merrygoroundsfour were beergardens four were restaurants and the rest were devotedto amusements of the usual countryfair type</s>  apparently they had littleattraction for country people</s>  the americans met few peasants in thegrounds and neither at the edison kinematograph where they refreshedtheir patriotism with some scenes of their native life nor at thelittle theatre where they saw the sports of the arena revived in thewrestle of a woman with a bear did any of the people except tradesmenand artisans seem to be taking part in the festival expression of thepopular pleasure</s> the woman who finally threw the bear whether by slight or by mainstrength or by a previous understanding with him

she began with the bearwhen they were both very young and she could easily throw him</s> well women have a great deal more strength than we suppose kenbybegan with a philosophical air that gave march the hope of some rationalconversation</s>  then his eye glazed with a faroff look and a dotingsmile came into his face</s>  when we went through the dresden gallerytogether rose and i were perfectly used up at the end of an hour buthis mother kept on as long as there was anything to see and came awayas fresh as a peach</s> then march saw that it was useless to expect anything different fromhim and he let him talk on about mrs</s>  adding all the rest of the wayback to the hotel</s>  kenby seemed only to have begun when they reached thedoor and wanted to continue the subject in the readingroom</s> march pleaded his wish to find how his wife had got through theafternoon and he escaped to her</s>  he would have told her now that kenbywas in the house but he was really so sick of the fact himself that hecould not speak of it at once and he let her go on celebrating all shehad seen from the window since she had waked from her long nap</s>  she saidshe could never be glad enough

princessmaria looks the last of the stuarts you know and some people considerher the rightful queen of england and ill have the supper ordered andwe can go down as soon as youve got back</s> lv</s> march felt rather shabby stealing away without kenby but he had reallyhad as much of mrs</s>  adding as he could stand for one day and he waseven beginning to get sick of rose</s>  besides he had not sent back aline for every other week yet and he had made up his mind to write asketch of the manoeuvres</s>  to this end he wished to receive an impressionof the princeregents arrival which should not be blurred or cloudedby other interests</s>  his wife knew the kind of thing he liked to see andwould have helped him out with his observations but kenby would havegot in the way and would have clogged the movement of his fancy inassigning the facts to the parts he would like them to play in thesketch</s> at least he made some such excuses to himself as he hurried along towardthe kaiserstrasse</s>  the draught of universal interest in that directionhad left the other streets almost deserted but as he approachedthe thoroughfare he found all the ways blocked and the horsecarsordinarily so furiously headlong arrested by the multiple ranks ofspectators on the sidewalks</s>  the avenue leading from the railway stationto the palace was decorated with flags and garlands and planted withthe stems of young firs and birches</s>  the doorways were crowded and thewindows dense with eager faces peering out of the draped bunting</s>  thecarriageway was kept clear by mild policemen who now and then allowedone of the crowd to cross it</s> the crowd was made up mostly of women and boys and when march joinedthem they had already been waiting an hour for the sight of the princeswho were to bless them with a vision of the faery race which kingsalways are to common men</s>  he thought the people looked dull andtherefore able to bear the strain of expectation with patience betterthan a livelier race</s>  they relieved it by no attempt at joking hereand there a dim smile dawned on a weary face but it seemed an effectof amiability rather than humor</s>  there was so little of this or elseit was so well bridled by the solemnity of the occasion that not a manwoman or child laughed when a bareheaded maidservant broke throughthe lines and ran down between them with a lifesize plaster bust of theemperor william in her arms she carried it like an overgrown infantand in alarm at her conspicuous part she cast frightened looks from sideto side without arousing any sort of notice</s>  undeterred by her failurea young dog parted from his owner and seeking him in the crowdpursued his search in a wild flight down the guarded roadway with an airof anxiety that in america would have won him thunders of applause andall sorts of kindly encouragements to greater speed</s>  but this germancrowd witnessed his progress apparently without interest and without asign of pleasure</s>  they were there to see the princeregent arriveand they did not suffer themselves to be distracted by any preliminaryexcitement</s>  suddenly the indefinable emotion which expresses thefulfilment of expectation in a waiting crowd passed through themultitude and before he realized it march was looking into the friendlygraybearded face of the princeregent for the moment that his carriageallowed in passing</s>  this came first preceded by four outriders andfollowed by other simple equipages of bavarian blue full of highnessesof all grades</s>  beside the regent sat his daughterinlaw the princessmaria her silvered hair framing a face as plain and good as theregents if not so intelligent</s> he in virtue of having been born in wurzburg is officially supposedto be specially beloved by his fellow townsmen and they now testifiedtheir affection as he whirled through their ranks bowing right andleft by what passes in germany for a cheer</s>  it is the word hochgroaned forth from abdominal depths and dismally prolonged in a hollowroar like that which the mob makes behind the scenes at the theatrebefore bursting in visible tumult on the stage</s>  then the crowddispersed and march came away wondering why such a kindlylookingprinceregent should not have given them a little longer sight ofhimself after they had waited so patiently for hours to see him</s>  butdoubtless in those countries he concluded the art of keeping thesovereign precious by suffering him to be rarely and briefly seen iswisely studied</s> on his way home he resolved to confess kenbys presence and he did soas soon as he sat down to supper with his wife</s>  i ought to have toldyou the first thing after breakfast</s>  but when i found you in that moodof having the place all to ourselves i put it off</s>
you took terrible chances my dear she said gravely</s> and i have been terribly punished</s>  youve no idea how much kenby hastalked to me about mrs</s>  adding</s> she broke out laughing</s>  well perhaps youve suffered enough</s>  but youcan see now cant you that it would have been awful if i had met himand let out that i didnt know he was here</s> terrible</s>  but if i had told it would have spoiled the whole morningfor you you couldnt have thought of anything else</s> oh i dont know she said airily</s>  what should you think if i toldyou i had known he was here ever since last night</s>  she went on indelight at the start he gave</s>  i saw him come into the hotel while youwere gone for the guidebooks and i determined to keep it from you aslong as i could i knew it would worry you</s>

fellow</s>  anddont suppose that im guilty of concealment because i havent told youbefore</s>  i was just thinking whether i wouldnt spare you till morningbut now i shall let you take the brunt of it</s>  mrs</s>  adding and rose arehere</s>  she gave the fact time to sink in and then she added and misstriscoe and her father are here</s> what is the matter with major eltwin and his wife being here too</s>  arethey in our hotel</s> no they are not</s>  they came to look for rooms while you were offwaiting for the princeregent and i saw them</s>  they intended to go tofrankfort for the

i told youat carlsbad i thought that ridiculous old thing was making up to mrs</s> adding</s> kenby</s>  why of codont be stupid my dear</s>  no not kenby general triscoe</s>  i wishyou could have been here to see him paying her all sort of sillyattentions and hear him making her compliments</s> thank you</s>  i think im just as well without it</s>  did she pay him sillyattentions and compliments too</s> thats the only thing that can make me forgive her for his wanting her</s> she was keeping him at armslength the whole time and she was doing itso as not to make him contemptible

wont saythat</s>  its really nothing but general triscoes being an old goose abouther that makes her seem so and it isnt fair</s> march went down to his coffee in the morning with the delicate duty oftelling kenby that mrs</s>  adding was in town</s>  kenby seemed to think itquite natural she should wish to see the manoeuvres and not at allstrange that she should come to them with general triscoe and hisdaughter</s>  he asked if march would not go with him to call upon her afterbreakfast and as this was in the line of his own instructions from mrs</s> march he went</s> they found mrs</s>  adding with the triscoes and march saw nothing that wasnot merely friendly or at the most fatherly in the generals behaviortoward her</s>  if mrs</s>  adding or miss triscoe saw more they hid it ina guise of sisterly affection for each other</s>  at the most the generalshowed a gayety which one would not have expected of him under anyconditions and which the fact that he and rose had kept each otherawake a good deal the night before seemed so little adapted to callout</s>  he joked with rose about their room and their beds and put ona comradery with him that was not a perfect fit and that suffered bycontrast with the pleasure of the boy and kenby in meeting</s>  there was acertain question in the attitude of mrs</s>  adding till march helped kenbyto account for his presence then she relaxed in an effect of securityso tacit that words overstate it and began to make fun of rose</s> march could not find that miss triscoe looked unhappy as his wife hadsaid he thought simply that she had grown plainer but when he reportedthis she lost her patience with him</s>  in a girl she said plainness wasunhappiness and she wished to know when he would ever learn to look aninch below the surface she was sure that agatha triscoe had notheard from burnamy since the emperors birthday that she was atswordspoints with her father and so desperate that she did not carewhat became of her</s> he had left kenby with the others and now after his wife had talkedherself tired of them all he proposed going out again to look aboutthe city where there was nothing for the moment to remind them of thepresence of their friends or even of their existence</s>  she answered thatshe was worrying about all those people and trying to work outtheir problem for them</s>  he asked why she did not let them work it outthemselves as they would have to do after all her worry and she saidthat where her sympathy had been excited she could not stop worryingwhether it did any good or not and she could not respect any one whocould drop things so completely out of his mind as he could she hadnever been able to respect that in him</s> i know my dear he assented</s>  but i dont think its a question ofmoral responsibility its a question of mental structure isnt it</s> your consciousness isnt built in thoughttight compartments and oneemotion goes all through it and sinks you but i simply close the doorsand shut the emotion in and keep on</s> the fancy pleased him so much that he worked it out in all itsimplications and could not after their long experience of each otherrealize that she was not enjoying the joke too till she said she sawthat he merely wished to tease</s>  then too late he tried to share herworry but she protested that she was not worrying at all that shecared nothing about those people that she was nervous she was tiredand she wished he would leave her and go out alone</s> he found himself in the street again and he perceived that he must bewalking fast when a voice called him by name and asked him what hishurry was</s>  the voice was stollers who got into step with him andfollowed the first with a second question</s> made up your mind to go to the manoeuvres with me</s> his bluntness made it easy for march to answer im afraid my wifecouldnt stand the drive back and forth</s> come without her</s> thank you</s>  its very kind of you</s>  im not certain that i shall go atall</s>  if i do i shall run out by train and take my chances with thecrowd</s> stoller insisted no further</s>  he felt no offence at the refusal of hisoffer or chose to show none</s>  he said with the same uncouth abruptnessas before heard anything of that fellow since he left carlsbad</s> burnamy</s> mm</s> no</s> know where he is</s> i dont in the least</s> stoller let another silence elapse while they hurried on before hesaid i got to thinking what he done afterwards</s>  he wasnt bound tolook out for me he might suppose i knew what i was about</s> march turned his face and stared in stollers which he was letting hangforward as he stamped heavily on</s>  had the disaster proved less thanhe had feared and did he still want burnamys help in patching upthe broken pieces

thesame light</s> i know he did said stoker with a blaze as from a longsmoulderingfury and damn him im not going to have it</s>  im not going to pleadthe baby act with him or with any man</s>  you tell him so when you getthe chance</s>  you tell him i dont hold him accountable for anything imade him do</s>  that aint business i dont want him around me any morebut if he wants to go back to the paper he can have his place</s>  you tellhim i stand by what i done and its all right between him and me</s>  ihaint done anything about it the way i wanted him to help me to ivelet it lay and im agoing to</s>  i guess it aint going to do me anyharm after all our people haint got very long memories but if it islet it</s>  you tell him its all right</s> i dont know where he is mr</s>  stoller and i dont know that i care tobe the bearer of your message said march</s> why not</s> why for one thing i dont agree with you that its all right</s>  yourchoosing to stand by the consequences of burnamys wrong doesnt undoit</s>  as i understand you dont pardon itstoller gulped and did not answer at once</s>  then he said i stand bywhat i done</s>  im not going to let him say i turned him down for doingwhat i told him to because i hadnt the sense to know what i wasabout</s> ah i dont think its a thing hell like to speak of in any casesaid march</s> stoller left him at the corner they had reached as abruptly as he hadjoined him and march hurried back to his wife and told her what hadjust passed between him and stoller</s> she broke out well i am surprised at you my dear</s>  you have alwaysaccused me of suspecting people and attributing bad motives and hereyouve refused even to give the poor man the benefit of the doubt</s>  hemerely wanted to save his savage pride with you and thats all he wantsto do with burnamy</s>  how could it hurt the poor boy to know that stollerdoesnt blame him</s>  why should you refuse to give his message to burnamy</s> i dont want you to ridicule me for my conscience any more basilyoure twice as bad as i ever was</s>  dont you think that a person canever expiate an offence</s>  ive often heard you say that if any one ownedhis fault he put it from him and it was the same as if it hadnt beenand hasnt burnamy owned up over and over again</s>  im astonished at youdearest</s> march was in fact somewhat astonished at himself in the light of herreasoning but she went on with some sophistries that restored him tohis selfrighteousness</s> i suppose you think he has interfered with stollers politicalambition and injured him in that way</s>  well what if he has</s>  would it bea good thing to have a man like that succeed in politics</s>  youre alwayssaying that the low character of our politicians is the ruin of thecountry and im sure she added with a prodigious leap over all thesequences that mr</s>  stoller is acting nobly and its your duty to helphim relieve burnamys mind</s>  at the laugh he broke into she hastened tosay or if you wont i hope youll not object to my doing so for ishall anyway</s> she rose as if she were going to begin at once in spite of hislaughing and in fact she had already a plan for coming to stollersassistance by getting at burnamy through miss triscoe whom shesuspected of knowing where he was</s>  there had been no chance for themto speak of him either that morning or the evening before and aftera great deal of controversy with herself in her husbands presence shedecided to wait till they came naturally together the next morning forthe walk to the capuchin church on the hill beyond the river whichthey had agreed to take</s>  she could not keep from writing a note tomiss triscoe begging her to be sure to come and hinting that she hadsomething very important to speak of</s> she was not sure but she had been rather silly to do this but when theymet the girl confessed that she had thought of giving up the walk andmight not have come except for mrs</s>  marchs note</s>  she had come withrose and had left him below with march mrs</s>  adding was coming laterwith kenby and general triscoe</s> mrs</s>  march lost no time in telling her the great news and if she hadbeen in doubt before of the girls feeling for burnamy she was now innone</s>  she had the pleasure of seeing her flush with hope and then thepain which was also a pleasure of seeing her blanch with dismay</s> i dont know where he is mrs</s>  march</s>  i havent heard a word from himsince that night in carlsbad</s>  i expectedi didnt know but youmrs</s>  march shook her head</s>  she treated the fact skillfully as somethingto be regretted simply because it would be such a relief to burnamy toknow how mr</s>  stoller now felt</s>  of course they could reach him somehowyou could always get letters to people in europe in the end andin fact it was altogether probable that he was that very instant inwurzburg for if the new yorkparis chronicle had wanted him to writeup the wagner operas it would certainly want him to write up themanoeuvres</s>  she established his presence in wurzburg by such anirrefragable chain of reasoning that at a knock outside she was justable to kelp back a scream while she ran to open the door</s>  it was notburnamy as in compliance with every nerve it ought to have been buther husband who tried to justify his presence by saying that they wereall waiting for her and miss triscoe and asked when they were coming</s> she frowned him silent and then shut herself outside with him longenough to whisper say shes got a headache or anything you pleasebut dont stop talking here with me or i shall go wild</s>  she then shutherself in again with the effect of holding him accountable for thewhole affair</s> lvi</s> general triscoe could not keep his irritation at hearing that hisdaughter was not coming out of the excuses he made to mrs</s>  adding hesaid again and again that it must seem like a discourtesy to her</s>  shegayly disclaimed any such notion she would not hear of putting offtheir excursion to another day it had been raining just long enough togive them a reasonable hope of a few hours drought and they might nothave another dry spell for weeks</s>  she slipped off her jacket after theystarted and gave it to kenby but she let general triscoe hold herumbrella over her while he limped beside her</s>  she seemed to march ashe followed with rose to be playing the two men off against each otherwith an ease which he wished his wife could be there to see and tojudge aright</s> they crossed by the old bridge which is of the earliest years of theseventh century between rows of saints whose statues surmount thepiers</s>  some are bishops as well as saints one must have been at romein his day for he wore his long thick beard in the fashion ofmichelangelos moses</s>  he stretched out toward the passers two fingersof blessing and was unaware of the sparrow which had lighted on themand was giving him the effect of offering it to the public admiration</s> squads of soldiers tramping by turned to look and smile and the dullfaces of citizens lighted up at the quaint sight</s>  some children stoppedand remained very quiet not to scare away the bird and a coldfacedspirituallooking priest paused among them as if doubting whether torescue the absentminded bishop from a situation derogatory to hisdignity but he passed on and then the sparrow suddenly flew off</s> rose adding had lingered for the incident with march but they nowpushed on and came up with the others at the end of the bridge wherethey found them in question whether they had not better take a carriageand drive to the foot of the hill before they began their climb</s>  marchthanked them but said he was keeping up the terms of his cure andwas getting in all the walking he could</s>  rose begged his mother not toinclude him in the driving party he protested that he was feeling sowell and the walk was doing him good</s>  his mother consented if he wouldpromise not to get tired and then she mounted into the twospannerwhich had driven instinctively up to their party when their parleybegan and general triscoe took the place beside her while kenby withsmiling patience seated himself in front</s> rose kept on talking with march about wurzburg and its history which itseemed he had been reading the night before when he could not sleep</s>  heexplained we get little histories of the places wherever we go</s>  thatswhat mr</s>  kenby does you know</s> oh yes said march</s> i dont suppose i shall get a chance to read much here

i dont read i think and that keeps me awake worse</s> of course i respect general triscoe for being in the war and gettingwounded the boy suggested</s> a good many did it march was tempted to say</s> the boy did not notice his insinuation</s>  i suppose there were somethings they did in the army and then they couldnt get over the habit</s> but general grant says in his life that he never used a profaneexpletive</s> does general triscoe</s> rose answered reluctantly if anything wakes him in the night or if hecant make these german beds over to suit himi see</s>  march turned his face to hide the smile which he would nothave let the boy detect</s>  he thought best not to let rose resume hisimpressions of the general and in talk of weightier matters they foundthemselves at that point of the climb where the carriage was waitingfor them</s>  from this point they followed an alley through ivied gardenwalls till they reached the first of the balustraded terraces whichascend to the crest of the hill where the church stands</s>  each terraceis planted with sycamores and the face of the terrace wall supportsa bassrelief commemorating with the drama of its lifesize figures thestations of the cross</s> monks and priests were coming and going and dropped on the stepsleading from terrace to terrace were women and children on their kneesin prayer</s>  it was all richly reminiscent of pilgrim scenes in othercatholic lands but here there was a touch of earnest in the northernface of the worshipers which the south had never imparted</s>  even in thebeautiful rococo interior of the church at the top of the hill therewas a sense of something deeper and truer than mere ecclesiasticismand march came out of it in a serious muse while the boy at his sidedid nothing to interrupt</s>  a vague regret filled his heart as he gazedsilently out over the prospect of river and city and vineyard purplingtogether below the top where he stood and mixed with this regret was avague resentment of his wifes absence</s>  she ought to have been thereto share his pang and his pleasure they had so long enjoyed everythingtogether that without her he felt unable to get out of either emotionall there was in it</s> the forgotten boy stole silently down the terraces after the rest ofthe party who had left him behind with march</s>  at the last terrace theystopped and waited and after a delay that began to be long to mrs</s> adding she wondered aloud what could have become of them</s> kenby promptly offered to go back and see and she consented in seemingto refuse it isnt worth while</s>  rose has probably got mr</s>  march intosome deep discussion and theyve forgotten all about us</s>  but if youwill go mr</s>  kenby you might just remind rose of my existence</s>  she lethim lay her jacket on her shoulders before he left her and then she satdown on one of the steps which general triscoe kept striking with thepoint of her umbrella as he stood before her</s> i really shall have to take it from you if you do that any more shesaid laughing up in his face</s>  im serious</s> he stopped</s>  i wish i could believe you were serious for a moment</s> you may if you think it will do you any good</s>  but i dont see why</s> the general smiled but with a kind of tremulous eagerness which mighthave been pathetic to any one who liked him</s>  do you know this is almostthe first time i have spoken alone with you</s> really i hadnt noticed said mrs</s>  adding</s> general triscoe laughed in rather a ghastly way</s>  well thatsencouraging at least to a man whos had his doubts whether it wasntintended</s> intended</s>  by whom</s>  what do you mean general triscoe</s>  why in the worldshouldnt you have spoken alone with me before</s> he was not with all his eagerness ready to say and while she smiledpleasantly she had the look in her eyes of being brought to bay andbeing prepared if it must come to that to have the worst over thenand there</s>  she was not half his age but he was aware of her having norespect for his years compared with her average american past as heunderstood it his social place was much higher but she was not in theleast awed by it in spite of his war record she was making him behavelike a coward</s>  he was in a false position and if he had any one buthimself to blame he had not her</s>  he read her equal knowledge of thesefacts in the clear eyes that made him flush and turn his own away</s> then he started with a quick hello</s>  and stood staring up at the stepsfrom the terrace above where rose adding was staying himself weakly bya clutch of kenby on one side and march on the other</s> his mother looked round and caught herself up from where she sat and rantoward him</s>  oh rose</s> its nothing mother he called to her and as she dropped on herknees before him he sank limply against her</s>  it was like what i had incarlsbad thats all</s>  dont worry about me please</s> im not worrying rose she said with courage of the same texture ashis own</s>  youve been walking too much</s>  you must go back in the carriagewith us</s>  cant you have it come here</s>  she asked kenby</s> theres no road mrs</s>  adding</s>  but if rose would let me carry himi can walk the boy protested trying to lift himself from her neck</s> no no</s>  you mustnt</s>  she drew away and let him fall into the arms thatkenby put round him</s>  he raised the frail burden lightly to his shoulderand moved strongly away followed by the eyes of the spectators who hadgathered about the little group but who dispersed now and went back totheir devotions</s> march hurried after kenby with mrs</s>  adding whom he told he had justmissed rose and was looking about for him when kenby came with hermessage for them</s>  they made sure that he was nowhere about the churchand then started together down the terraces</s>  at the second or thirdstation below they found the boy clinging to the barrier that protectedthe bassrelief from the zeal of

landlord deplored the fact and sent hospitably out to try andplace them at the elephant</s>  but the elephant was full and the russiancourt was full too</s>  then the landlord of the crownprince

landlordcontinued to the last as benevolent as if they had been a profit insteadof a loss to him</s> the streets of the town at nine oclock were empty and quiet and theyinstantly felt the academic quality of the place</s>  through the pale nightthey could see that the architecture was of the classic sentiment whichthey were destined to feel more and more at one point they caught afleeting

its streets wherehe encountered a few passers several blocks apart was their habitualmood</s>  he came promptly upon two objects which he would willingly haveshunned a denkmal of the francogerman war not so furiously badas most german monuments but antipathetic and uninteresting as allpatriotic monuments are and a womananddog team</s>  in the shock fromthis he was sensible that he had not seen any womananddog teams forsome time and he wondered by what civic or ethnic influences theirdistribution was so controlled that they should have abounded inhamburg leipsic and carlsbad and wholly ceased in nuremberg ansbachand wurzburg to reappear again in weimar though they seemed ascharacteristic of all germany as the ugly denkmals to her victories overfrance</s> the goethe and schiller monument which he had glimpsed the night beforewas characteristic too but less offensively so</s>  german statues at thebest are conscious and the poetpair as the inscription calls themhave the air of showily confronting posterity with their clasped handsand of being only partially rapt from the spectators</s>  but they were moreunconscious than any other german statues that march had seen and hequelled a desire to ask goethe as he stood with his hand on schillersshoulder and looked serenely into space far above one of the typicalequipages of his country what he thought of that sort of thing</s>  butupon reflection he did not know why goethe should be held personallyresponsible for the existence of the womananddog team</s>  he felt that hemight more reasonably attribute to his taste the prevalence of classicprofiles which he began to note in the weimar populace</s>  this could bea sympathetic effect of that passion for the antique which the poetbrought back with him from his sojourn in italy though many of thepeople especially the children were bowlegged</s>  perhaps the antiquehad begun in their faces and had not yet got down to their legs inany case they were charming children and as a test of their culture hehad a mind to ask a little girl if she could tell him where the statueof herder was which he thought he might as well take in on his rambleand so be done with as many statues as he could</s>  she answered with apretty regret in her tender voice that i truly cannot and he wasmore satisfied than if she could for he thought it better to be a childand honest than to know where any german statue was</s> he easily found it for himself in the place which is called the herderplatz after it</s>  he went into the peter and paul church there whereherder used to preach sermons sometimes not at all liked by thenobility and gentry for their revolutionary tendency the sovereign wasshielded from the worst effects of his doctrine by worshipping apartfrom other sinners in a glazed gallery</s>  herder is buried in the churchand when you ask where the sacristan lifts a wooden trapdoor in thepavement and you think you are going down into the crypt but you areonly to see herders monumental stone which is kept covered so to saveit from passing feet</s>  here also is the greatest picture of that greatsoul luke kranach who had sincerity enough in his paining to atone forall the swelling german sculptures in the world</s>  it is a crucifixionand the cross is of a white birch log such as might have been cut outof the weimar woods shaved smooth on the sides with the bark showingat the edges</s>  kranach has put himself among the spectators and a streamof blood from the side of the savior falls in baptism upon the paintershead</s>  he is in the company of john the

afestive mood because this was sedan day their curiosity if not theirsympathy accepted the chance gratefully</s>  but they were almost movedto wish that the war had gone otherwise when they learned that all thepublic carriages were engaged and they must have one from a stable ifthey wished to drive after breakfast</s>  still it was offered them forsuch a modest number of marks and their driver proved so friendly andconversable that they assented to the course of history and were moreand more reconciled as they bowled along through the grandducal parkbeside the waters of the classic ilm</s> the waters of the classic ilm are sluggish and slimy in places and inplaces clear and brooklike but always a dull dark green in color</s>  theyflow in the shadow of pensive trees and by the brinks of sunny meadowswhere the aftermath wanders in heavy windrows and the children sportjoyously over the smoothmown surfaces in all the freedom that there isin germany</s>  at last after immemorial appropriation the owners of theearth are everywhere expropriated and the people come into the pleasureif not the profit of it</s>  at last the prince the knight the noblefinds as in his turn the

smiled to think that in this very weimar where sovereigntyhad graced and ennobled itself as nowhere else in the world by thecompanionship of letters and the arts they still were not hurryingfirst to see the palace of a prince but were involuntarily making itsecond to the cottage of a poet</s>  but in fact it is goethe who is foreverthe prince in weimar</s>  his greatness blots out its history his namefills the city the thought of him is its chiefest imitation and largesthospitality</s>  the travellers remembered above all other facts of thegrandducal park that it was there he first met christiane vulpiusbeautiful and young when he too was beautiful and young and took herhome to be his love to the just and lasting displeasure of fran vonstein who was even less reconciled when after eighteen years of duereflection the love of goethe and christiane became their marriage</s> they wondered just where it was he saw the young girl coming to meethim as the granddukes minister with an officeseeking petition fromher brother goethes brother author long famed and long forgotten forhis romantic tale of rinaldo rinaldini</s> they had indeed no great mind in their american respectability forthat rather matteroffact and deliberate liaison and little as theirsympathy was for the passionless intellectual intrigue with the frau vonstein it cast no halo of sentiment about the goethe cottage to supposethat there his lovelife with christiane began</s>  mrs</s>  march even resentedthe fact and when she learned later that it was not the fact at allshe removed it from her associations

was some comfort to reflect thatshe had not promised but it was not comfort enough to restore him tosuch fragmentary selfrespect as he had been enjoying since he partedwith agatha triscoe in carlsbad

apparently no official observance of theholiday perhaps because the grandduke was away at the manoeuvreswith all the other german princes</s>  burnamy had hoped for some voluntaryexcitement among the people at least enough to warrant him in making apaper about sedan day in weimar which he could sell somewhere but thenight was falling and there was still no sign of popular rejoicingover the french humiliation twentyeight years before except in themultitude of japanese lanterns which the children were everywherecarrying at the ends of sticks</s>  babies had them in their carriagesand the effect of the floating lights in the winding upanddownhillstreets was charming even to burnamys lacklustre eyes</s>  he went byhis hotel and on to a cafe with a garden where there was a patrioticconcert

notresign herself to it till her husband suggested that she should considerit providential</s>  this touched the lingering superstition in which shehad been ancestrally taught to regard herself as a means when in a verytight place and to leave the responsibility with the moral governmentof the universe</s>  as she now perceived it had been the same as orderedthat they should see burnamy under such conditions in the afternoon thatthey could not speak to him and hear where he was staying and in aninferior degree it had been the same as ordered that march should seehim in the evening and tell him everything so that she should knowjust how to act when she saw him in the morning</s>  if he could plausiblyaccount for the renewal of his flirtation with miss elkins or if heseemed generally worthy apart from that she could forgive him</s> it was so pleasant when he came in at breakfast with his wellrememberedsmile that she did not require from him any explicit defence</s>  whilethey talked she was righting herself in an undercurrent of drama withmiss triscoe and explaining to her that they could not possibly waitover for her and her father in weimar but must be off that day forberlin as they had made all their plans</s>  it was not easy even in dramawhere one has everything ones own way to prove that she could notwithout impiety so far interfere with the course of providence as toprevent miss triscoes coming with her father to the same hotel whereburnamy was staying</s>  she contrived indeed to persuade her that she hadnot known he was staying there when she telegraphed them where to comeand that in the absence of any open confidence from miss triscoe she wasnot obliged to suppose that his presence would be embarrassing</s> march proposed leaving her with burnamy while he went up into the townand interviewed the house of schiller which he had not done yet andas soon as he got himself away she came to business breaking altogetherfrom the inner drama

 i wonder she broke off to preventhis persistence at a point where her nerves were beginning to give waywhat can be keeping mr</s>  march</s> nothing much more important it appeared later than the pleasure ofsauntering through the streets on the way to the house of schiller andlooking at the pretty children going to school with books under theirarms</s>  it was the day for the schools to open after the long summervacation and there was a freshness of expectation in the shining faceswhich if it could not light up his own graybeard visage could at leasttouch his heartwhen he reached the schiller house he found that it was really notthe schiller house but the schiller flat of three or four rooms oneflight up whose windows look out upon the street named after the poet</s> the whole place is bare and clean in one corner of the large roomfronting the street stands schillers writingtable with his chairbefore it with the foot extending toward this there stands in anothercorner the narrow bed on which he died some withered wreaths on thepillow frame a picture of his deathmask which at first glance is likehis dead face lying there</s>  it is all rather tasteless and all rathertouching and the place with its meagre appointments as compared withthe rich goethe house suggests that personal competition with goethe inwhich schiller is always falling into the second place</s>  whether it willbe finally so with him in literature it is too early to ask of time andupon other points eternity will not be interrogated</s>  the great goetheand the good schiller they remain and yet march reasoned there wassomething good in goethe and something great in schiller</s> he was so full of the pathos of their inequality before the world thathe did not heed the warning on the door of the pastryshop near theschiller house and on opening it he bedaubed his hand with the freshpaint on it</s>  he was then in such a state that he could not bring hismind to bear upon the question of which cakes his wife would probablyprefer and he stood helplessly holding up his hand till the good womanbehind the counter discovered his plight and uttered a loud cry ofcompassion</s>  she ran and got a wet napkin which she rubbed with soapand then she instructed him by word and gesture to rub his hand uponit and she did not leave him till his rescue was complete</s>  he let herchoose a variety of the cakes for him and came away with a gay paperbag full of them and with the feeling that he had been in more intimaterelations with the life of weimar than travellers are often privilegedto be</s>  he argued from the instant and intelligent sympathy of the pastrywoman a high grade of culture in all classes and he conceived thenotion of pretending to mrs</s>  march that he had got these cakes from adescendant of schiller</s> his deceit availed with her for the brief moment in which she alwaysafter so many years experience of his duplicity believed anything hetold her</s>  they dined merrily together at their hotel and then burnamycame down to the station with them and was very comfortable to march inhelping him to get their tickets and their baggage registered</s>  the trainwhich was to take them to halle where they were to change for berlinwas rather late and they had but ten minutes after it came in before itwould start again</s>  mrs</s>  march was watching impatiently at the window ofthe waitingroom for the dismounting passengers to clear the platformand allow the doors to be opened suddenly she gave a cry and turnedand ran into the passage by which the new arrivals were pouring outtoward the superabundant omnibuses</s>  march and burnamy who had beentalking apart mechanically rushed after her and found her kissing misstriscoe and shaking hands with the general amidst a tempest of questionsand answers from which it appeared that the triscoes had got tired ofstaying in wurzburg and had simply come on to weimar a day sooner thanthey had intended</s> the general was rather much bundled up for a day which was mild for agerman summer day and he coughed out an explanation that he had takenan abominable cold at that ridiculous parade and had not shaken itoff yet</s>  he had a notion that change of air would be better for him itcould not be worse</s> he seemed a little vague as to burnamy rather than inimical</s>  while theladies were still talking eagerly together in proffer and acceptanceof mrs</s>  marchs lamentations that she should be going away just as misstriscoe was coming he asked if the omnibus for their hotel was there</s> he by no means resented burnamys assurance that it was and he did notrefuse to let him order their baggage little and large loaded uponit</s>  by the time this was done mrs</s>  march and miss triscoe had so fardetached themselves from each other that they could separate after onemore formal expression of regret and forgiveness</s>  with a lament intowhich she poured a world of inarticulate emotions mrs</s>  march wrenchedherself from the place and suffered herself to be pushed toward hertrain</s>  but with the last long look which she cast over her shoulderbefore she vanished into the waitingroom she saw miss triscoe andburnamy transacting the elaborate politenesses of amiable strangerswith regard to the very small bag which the girl had in her hand</s>  hesucceeded in relieving her of it and then he led the way out of thestation on the left of the general while miss triscoe brought up therear</s> lxiii</s> from the window of the train as it drew out mrs</s>  march tried for aglimpse of the omnibus in which her proteges were now rolling awaytogether</s>  as they were quite out of sight in the omnibus which wasitself out of sight she failed but as she fell back against her seatshe treated the recent incident with a complexity and simultaneityof which no report can give an idea</s>  at the end one fatal convictionremained that in everything she had said she had failed to explain tomiss triscoe how burnamy happened to be in weimar and how he happened tobe there with them in the station</s>  she required march to say how she hadoverlooked the very things which she ought to have mentioned first andwhich she had on the point of her tongue the whole time</s>  she went overthe entire ground again to see if she could discover the reason why shehad made such an unaccountable break and it appeared that she was ledto it by his rushing after her with burnamy before she had had a chanceto say a word about him of course she could not say anything in hispresence</s>  this gave her some comfort and there was consolation in thefact that she had left them together without the least intention orconnivance and now no matter what happened she could not accuseherself and he could not accuse her of matchmaking</s> he said that his own sense of guilt was so great that he should notdream of accusing her of anything except of regret that now shecould never claim the credit of bringing the lovers together undercircumstances so favorable</s>  as soon as they were engaged they could joinin renouncing her with a good conscience and they would probably makethis the basis of their efforts to propitiate the general</s> she said she did not care and with the mere removal of the lovers inspace her interest in them began to abate</s>  they

been two dollars instead of two marks theywould have had every advantage of american travel</s> on the way to berlin the country was now fertile and flat and nowsterile and flat near the capital the level sandy waste spread almostto its gates</s>  the train ran quickly through the narrow fringe ofsuburbs and then they were in one of those vast continental stationswhich put our outdated depots to shame</s>  the good traeger whotook possession of them and their handbags put their boxes on abaggagebearing drosky and then got them another drosky for theirpersonal transportation</s>  this was a drosky of the firstclass but theywould not have thought it so either from the vehicle itself or fromthe appearance of the driver and his horses</s>  the public carriages ofgermany are the shabbiest in the world at berlin the horses look likeold hair trunks and the drivers like their motheaten contents</s> the marches got no splendor for the two prices they paid and theirapproach to their hotel on

evening looking for another hotel whose firstrequisite should be that it was not on unter den linden</s>  what mainlydetermined mrs</s>  march in favor of the large handsome impersonal placethey fixed upon was the fact that it was equipped for steamheatingwhat determined march was the fact that it had a passengeroffice wherewhen he wished to leave he could buy his railroad tickets and havehis baggage checked without the maddening anxiety of doing it at thestation</s>  but it was precisely in these points that the hotel whichadmirably fulfilled its other functions fell short</s>  the weather made asuccession of efforts throughout their stay to clear up cold it merelygrew colder without clearing up but this seemed to offer no suggestionof steam for heating their bleak apartment and the chilly corridors tothe management</s>  with the help of a large lamp which they kept burningnight and day they got the temperature of their rooms up to sixty therewas neither stove nor fireplace the cold electric bulbs diffused afrosty glare and in the vast stately diningroom with its vaultedroof there was nothing to warm them but their plates and the handlesof their knives and forks which by a mysterious inspiration werealways hot</s>  when they were ready to go march experienced from theapathy of the baggage clerk and the reluctance of the porters a morepiercing distress than any he had known at the railroad stations andone luckless valise which he ordered sent after him by express reachedhis bankers in paris a fortnight overdue with an accumulation ofcharges upon it outvaluing the books which it contained</s> but these were minor defects in an establishment which had many meritsand was mainly of the temperament and intention of the large englishrailroad hotels</s>  they looked from their windows down into a gardenedsquare peopled with a full share of the superabounding statues ofberlin and frequented by babies and nurse maids who seemed not to mindthe cold any more than the stone kings and generals</s>  the aspect of thissquare like the excellent cooking of the hotel and the architecture ofthe imperial capital suggested the superior civilization of paris</s>  eventhe rows of gray houses and private palaces of berlin are in the frenchtaste which is the only taste there is in berlin</s>  the suggestion ofparis is constant but it is of paris in exile and without the chicwhich the city wears in its native air</s>  the crowd lacks this as much asthe architecture and the sculpture there is no distinction among themen except for now and then a military figure and among the women nostyle such as relieves the commonplace rash of the new york streets</s>  theberliners are plain and ill dressed both men and women and even thelittle children are plain</s>  every one is ill dressed but no one isragged and among the undersized homely folk of the lower classes thereis no such povertystricken shabbiness as shocks and insults the sightin new york</s>  that which distinctly recalls our metropolis is the loftypassage of the elevated trains intersecting the prospectives of manystreets but in berlin the elevated road is carried on massive brickarchways and not lifted upon gay crazy iron ladders like ours</s> when you look away from this and regard berlin on its aesthetic sideyou are again in that banished paris whose captive artsoul is madeto serve so far

incoherent group of swelling and swaggeringbronze commemorating the victory of the first prussian emperor in thewar with the last french emperor and avenging the vanquished upon thevictors by its

uproarof melodrama and the marches stood stunned and bewildered by its wildexplosions</s> when they could escape they found themselves so convenient to theimperial palace that they judged best to discharge at once theobligation to visit it which must otherwise weigh upon them</s>  theyentered the court without opposition from the sentinel and joined otherstrangers straggling instinctively

troops were nearly all away at the manoeuvres there werehardly more in the streets than she had sometimes seen in washington</s> again the german officers signally failed to offer her any rudeness whenshe met them on the sidewalks</s>  there were scarcely any of themand perhaps that might have been the reason why they were not moreaggressive but a whole company of soldiers marching carelessly up tothe palace from the brandenburg gate without music or so much style asour own militia often puts on regarded her with inoffensive eyes so faras they looked at her</s>  she declared that personally there was nothingagainst the prussians even when in uniform they were kindly andmodestlooking men it was when they got up on pedestals in bronze ormarble that they began to bully and to brag</s> lxiv</s> the dinner which the marches got at a restaurant on unter den lindenalmost redeemed the avenue from the disgrace it had fallen into withthem</s>  it was the best meal they had yet

friendly spirit very sensible of their intelligentappreciation of the dinner and from him they formed a more respectfulopinion of berlin civilization than they had yet held</s>  after the mannerof

well withthe world at large to look carefully to the behavior of its cabmen andcar conductors its hotel clerks and waiters its theatreticket sellersand ushers its policemen and sacristans its landlords and salesmenfor by these rather than by its society women and its statesmen anddivines is it really judged in the books of travellers some attentionalso should be paid to the weather if the climate is to be praised</s>  inthe railroad cafe at potsdam there was a waiter so rude to the marchesthat if they had not been people of great strength of character hewould have undone the favorable impression the soldiers and civiliansof berlin generally had been at such pains to produce in them andthroughout the week of early september which they passed there itrained so much and so bitterly it was so wet and so cold that theymight have come away thinking its the worst climate in the world ifit had not been for a man whom they saw in one of the public gardenspouring a heavy stream from his garden hose upon the shrubbery alreadysoaked and shuddering in the cold</s>  but this convinced them that theywere suffering from weather and not from the climate which must reallybe hot and dry and they went home to their hotel and sat contentedlydown in a temperature of sixty degrees</s>  the weather was not alwaysso bad one day it was dry cold instead of wet cold with rough rustyclouds breaking a blue sky another day up to eleven in the forenoonit was like indian summer then it changed to a harsh november airand then it relented and ended so mildly that they hired chairs inthe place

blocks and detached edifices of limestone sandstone red and yellowbrick larger or smaller of no more uniformity than our suburbandwellings but never of their ugliness or lawless offensiveness</s> in an effort for the intimate life of the country march went twosuccessive mornings for his breakfast to the cafe bauer which has someadmirable wallprintings and is the chief cafe on unter den linden

affectionate constancyin the berliners and a hospitable observance of the tastes ofstrangers</s>  at his bankers on the other hand the cashier scrutinizedhis signature and remarked that it did not look like the signature inhis letter of credit and then he inferred a suspicious mind in themoneyed classes of prussia as he had not been treated with such unkinddoubt by hebrew bankers anywhere he made a mental note that the jewswere politer than the christians in germany</s>  in starting for potsdam heasked a traeger where the potsdam train was and the man said dat traindare and in coming back he helped a fat old lady out of the car andshe thanked him in english</s>  from these incidents both occurring thesame day in the same place the inference of a widespread knowledge ofour language in all classes of the population was inevitable</s> in this obvious and easy manner he studied contemporary civilization inthe capital</s>  he even carried his researches farther and went one rainyafternoon to an exhibition of modern pictures in a pavilion of thethiergarten where from the small attendance he inferred an indifferenceto the arts which he would not ascribe to the weather</s>  one evening at asummer theatre where they gave the pantomime of the puppenfee and theoperetta of hansel and gretel he observed that the greater part ofthe audience was composed of nice plain young girls and children and henoted that there was no sort of evening dress from the large number ofamericans present he imagined a numerous colony in berlin where theymast have an instinctive sense of their conationality since one ofthem in the stress of getting his hat and overcoat when they all cameout confidently addressed him in english</s>  but he took stock of hisimpressions with his wife and they seemed to him so few after allthat he could not resist a painful sense of isolation in the midst ofthe environment</s> they made a sunday excursion to the zoological gardens in thethiergarten with a large crowd of the lower classes but though theyhad a great deal of trouble in getting there by the various kinds ofhorsecars and electric cars they did not feel that they had got nearto the popular life</s>  they endeavored for some sense of berlin society bydriving home in a drosky and on the way they passed rows of beautifulhouses in french and italian taste fronting the deep damp green parkfrom the thiergartenstrasse in which they were confident cultivated anddelightful people lived but they remained to the last with nothing buttheir unsupported conjecture</s> lxv</s> their excursion to potsdam was the cream of their sojourn in berlin</s> they chose for it the first fair morning and they ran out over theflat sandy plains surrounding the capital and among the low hillssurrounding potsdam before it actually began to rain</s> they wished immediately to see sans souci for the great frederickssake and they drove through a lively shower to the palace where theywaited with a horde of twentyfive other tourists in a gusty colonnadebefore they were led through voltaires room and fredericks deathchamber</s> the french philosopher comes before the prussian prince at sans soucieven in the palatial villa which expresses the wilful caprice of thegreat frederick as few edifices have embodied the whims or tastes oftheir owners</s>  the whole affair is eighteenthcentury french as thegermans conceived it</s>  the gardened terrace from which the low onestorybuilding thickly crusted with baroque sculptures looks down into amanycolored parterre was

all again was french in the design the decoration andthe furnishing</s>  at that time there was in fact no other taste andfrederick who despised and disused his native tongue was resolved uponfrench taste even in his intimate companionship</s>  the droll story of hiscoquetry with the terrible free spirit which he got from france to behis guest is vividly reanimated at sans souci where one breathes thevery air in which the strangely assorted companions lived and in whichthey parted so soon to pursue each other with brutal annoyance on oneside and with merciless mockery on the other</s>  voltaire was long agorevenged upon his host for all the indignities he suffered from him intheir comedy he left deeply graven upon fredericks fame the trace ofthose lacerating talons which he could

a little and the sun shone out on the bloom of thelovely parterre where the marches profited by a smiling moment to wanderamong the statues and the roses heavy with the shower</s>  then they walkedback to their carriage and drove to the new palace which expresses indiffering architectural terms the same subjection to an alien idealof beauty</s>  it is thronged without by delightfully preposterous rococcostatues and within it is rich in all those curiosities and memorialsof royalty with which palaces so well know how to fatigue the flesh andspirit of their visitors</s> the marches escaped from it all with sighs and groans of relief andbefore they drove off to see the great fountain of the orangeries theydedicated a moment of pathos to the temple of friendship which frederickbuilt in memory of unhappy wilhelmina of beyreuth the sister he lovedin the common sorrow of their wretched home and neglected when he cameto his kingdom</s>  it is beautiful in its rococco

waiter we are in a hurry</s>  they looked round andsaw that it proceeded from the pretty nose of a young american girl whosat with a party of young american girls at a neighboring table</s>  thenthey perceived that all the people in that restaurant were americansmostly young girls who all looked as if they were in a hurry</s>  butneither their beauty nor their impatience had the least effect

father of frederick the mad old frederickwilliam brought up his children with that severity which solomon urgedbut probably did not practise</s>  it is a vast place but they had time forit all though

scale what allthe german princes and princelings had tried to do in imitation andemulation of french splendor</s>  in potsdam the grandeur was not ahistorical growth as at versailles but was the effect of family geniusin which there was often the curious fascination of insanity</s> they felt this strongly again amidst the futile monuments of thehohenzollern museum in berlin where all the

down to supper with burnamy</s>  she asked august whenshe gave him her fathers order to have a cup of tea sent to her roomwhere when it came she remained thinking so long that it was rathertepid by the time she drank it</s> then she went to her window and looked out first above and next below</s> above the moon was hanging over the gardened hollow before the museumwith the airy lightness of an american moon</s>  below was burnamy behindthe tubbed evergreens sitting tilted in his chair against the housewall with the spark of his cigar fainting and flashing like an americanfirefly</s>  agatha went down to the door after a little delay and seemedsurprised to find him there at least she said oh</s>  in a tone ofsurprise</s> burnamy stood up and answered nice night</s> beautiful</s>  she breathed</s>  i didnt suppose the sky in germany couldever be so clear</s> it seems to be doing its best</s> the flowers over there look like ghosts in the light she saiddreamily</s> theyre not</s>  dont you want to get your hat and wrap and go over andexpose the fraud</s> oh she answered as if it were merely a question of the hat and wrapi have them</s> they sauntered through the garden walks for a while long enough to haveascertained that there was not a veridical phantom among the flowers ifthey had been looking and then when they came to their accustomed seatthey sat down and she said i dont know that ive seen the moon soclear since we left carlsbad</s>  at the last word his heart gave a jumpthat seemed to lodge it in his throat and kept him from speaking sothat she could resume without interruption ive got something ofyours that you left at the posthof</s>  the girl that broke the dishesfound it and lili gave it to mrs</s>  march for you</s>  this did not accountfor agathas having the thing whatever it was but when she took ahandkerchief from her belt and put out her hand with it toward him heseemed to find that her having it had necessarily followed</s>  he tried totake it from her but his own hand trembled so that it clung to hersand he gasped cant you say now what you wouldnt say then</s> the logical sequence was no more obvious than be fore but sheapparently felt it in her turn as he had felt it in his</s>  she whisperedback yes and then she could not get out anything more till sheentreated in a halfstifled voice oh dont</s> no no</s>  he panted</s>  i wonti oughtnt to have done iti beg yourpardoni oughtnt to have spokenevenishe returned in a far less breathless and tremulous fashion but stillbetween laughing and crying i meant to make you</s>  and now if youreever sorry or im ever too topping about anything you can be perfectlyfree to say that youd never have spoken if you hadnt seen that iwanted you to</s> but i didnt see any such thing he protested</s>  i spoke because icouldnt help it any longer</s> she laughed triumphantly</s>  of course you think so</s>  and that shows thatyou are only a man after all in spite of your finessing</s>  but i am goingto have the credit of it</s>  i knew that you were holding back because youwere too proud or thought you hadnt the right or something</s>  werentyou</s>  she startled him with the sudden vehemence of her challenge ifyou pretend that you werent i shall never forgive you</s> but i was</s>  of course i was</s>  i was afraidisnt that what i said</s>  she triumphed over him with another laugh andcowered a little closer to him if that could be</s> they were standing without knowing how they had got to their feet andnow without any purpose of the kind they began to stroll again amongthe garden paths and to ask and to answer questions which touchedevery point of their common history and yet left it a mine ofinexhaustible knowledge for all future time</s>  out of the sweet and deardelight of this encyclopedian reserve two or three facts appeared witha present distinctness</s>  one of these was that burnamy had regarded herrefusal to be definite at carlsbad as definite refusal and had meantnever to see her again and certainly never to speak again of love toher</s>  another point was that she had not resented his coming back thatlast night but had been proud and happy in it as proof of his loveand had always meant somehow to let him know that she was torched byhis trusting her enough to come back while he was still under that cloudwith mr</s>  stoller</s>  with further logic purely of the heart she acquittedhim altogether of wrong in that affair and alleged in proof what mr</s> stoller had said of it to mr</s>  march</s>  burnamy owned that he knew whatstoller had said but even in his present condition he could not acceptfully her reading of that obscure passage of his life</s>  he preferred toput the question by and perhaps neither of them cared anything aboutit except as it related to the fact that they were now each othersforever</s> they agreed that they must write to mr</s>  and mrs</s>  march at once or atleast agatha said as soon as she had spoken to her father</s>  at hermention of her father she was aware of a doubt a fear in burnamy whichexpressed itself by scarcely more than a spiritual consciousness fromhis arm to the hands which she had clasped within it</s>  he has alwaysappreciated you she said courageously and i know he will see it inthe right light</s> she probably meant no more than to affirm her faith in her own abilityfinally to bring her father to a just mind concerning it but burnamyaccepted her assurance with buoyant hopefulness and said he would seegeneral triscoe the first thing in the morning</s> no i will see him she said i wish to see him first he will expectit of me</s>  we had better go in now she added but neither made anymotion for the present to do so</s>  on the contrary they walked in theother direction and it was an hour after agatha declared their duty inthe matter before they tried to fulfil it</s> then indeed after they returned to the hotel she lost no timein going to her father beyond that which must be given to a longhandpressure under the fresco of the five poets on the stairs landingwhere her ways and burnamys parted</s>  she went into her own room andsoftly opened the door into her fathers and listened</s> well</s>  he said in a sort of challenging voice</s> have you been asleep</s>  she asked</s> ive just blown out my light</s>  what has kept you</s> she did not reply categorically</s>  standing there in the sheltering darkshe said papa i wasnt very candid with you this afternoon</s>  i amengaged to mr</s>  burnamy</s> light the candle said her father</s>  or no he added before she coulddo so</s>  is it quite settled</s> quite she answered in a voice that admitted of no doubt</s>  that is asfar as it can be without you</s> dont be a hypocrite agatha said the general</s>  and let me try to getto sleep</s>  you know i dont like it and you know i cant help it</s> yes the girl assented</s> then go to bed said the general concisely</s> agatha did not obey her father</s>  she thought she ought to kiss him butshe decided that she had better postpone this so she merely gave hima tender goodnight to which he made no response and shut herselfinto her own room where she remained sitting and staring out into themoonlight with a smile that never left her lips</s> when the moon sank below the horizon the sky was pale with the comingday but before it was fairly dawn she saw something white not muchgreater than some moths moving before her window</s>  she pulled the valvesopen and found it a bit of paper attached to a thread dangling fromabove</s>  she broke it loose and in the morning twilight she read the greatcentral truth of the universei love you</s>  l</s>  j</s>  b</s> she wrote under the tremendous inspirationso do i</s>  dont be silly</s>  a</s>  t</s> she fastened the paper to the thread again and gave it a little twitch</s> she waited for the low note of laughter which did not fail to flutterdown from above then she threw herself upon the bed and fell asleep</s> it was not so late as she thought when she woke and it seemed atbreakfast that burnamy had been up still earlier</s>  of the three involvedin the anxiety of the night before general triscoe was still respitedfrom it by sleep but he woke much more haggard than either of the youngpeople</s>  they in fact were not at all haggard the worst was over ifbringing their engagement to his knowledge was the worst the formalityof asking his consent which burnamy still had to go through wasunpleasant but after all it was a formality</s>  agatha told him everythingthat had passed between herself and her father and if it had not thatcordiality on his part which they could have wished it was certainly nothopelessly discouraging</s> they agreed at breakfast that burnamy had better have it over as quicklyas possible and he waited only till august came down with the generalstray before going up to his room</s>  the young fellow did not feel more athis ease than the elder meant he should in taking the chair to which thegeneral waved him from where he lay in bed and there was no talk wastedupon the weather between them</s> i suppose i know what you have come for mr</s>  burnamy said generaltriscoe in a tone which was rather judicial than otherwise and isuppose you know why you have come</s>  the words certainly opened the wayfor burnamy but he hesitated so long to take it that the general hadabundant time to add i dont pretend that this event is unexpectedbut i should like to know what reason you have for thinking i shouldwish you to marry my daughter</s>  i take it for granted that you areattached to each other and we wont waste time on that point</s>  not tobeat about the bush on the next point let me ask at once what yourmeans of supporting her are</s>  how much did you earn on that newspaper inchicago</s> fifteen hundred dollars burnamy answered promptly enough</s> did you earn anything more say within the last year</s> i got three hundred dollars advance copyright for a book i sold to apublisher</s>  the glory had not yet faded from the fact in burnamys mind</s> eighteen hundred</s>  what did you get for your poem in marchs book</s> thats a very trifling matter fifteen dollars</s> and your salary as private secretary to that man stoller</s> thirty dollars a week and my expenses</s>  but i wouldnt take thatgeneral triscoe said burnamy</s> general triscoe from his lit de justice passed this point insilence</s>  have you any one dependent on you</s> my mother i take care of my mother answered burnamy proudly</s> since you have broken with stoller what are your prospects</s> i have none</s> then you dont expect to support my daughter you expect to live uponher means</s> i expect to do nothing of the kind</s>  cried burnamy</s>  i should beashamedi should feel disgracedi shouldi dont ask youi dont askher till i have the means to support herif you were very fortunate continued the general unmoved by theyoung fellows pain and unperturbed by the fact that he had himselflived upon his wifes means as long as she lived and then upon hisdaughters if you went back to stolleri wouldnt go back to him</s>  i dont say hes knowingly a rascal buthes ignorantly a rascal and he proposed a rascally thing to me</s>  ibehaved badly to him and id give anything to undo the wrong i let himdo himself but ill never go back to him</s> if you went back on your old salary the general persistedpitilessly you would be very fortunate if you brought your earnings upto twentyfive hundred a year</s> yesand how far do you think that would go in supporting my daughter on thescale she is used to</s>  i dont speak of your mother who has the firstclaim upon you</s> burnamy sat dumb and his head which he had lifted indignantly when thequestion was of stoller began to sink</s> the general went on</s>  you ask me to give you my daughter when youhavent money enough to keep her in gowns you ask me to give her to astrangernot quite a stranger general triscoe burnamy protested</s>  you haveknown me for three months at least and any one who knows me in chicagowill tell youa stranger and worse than a stranger the general continued sopleased with the logical perfection of his position that he almostsmiled and certainly softened toward burnamy</s>  it isnt a question ofliking you mr</s>  burnamy but of knowing you my daughter likes you sodo the marches so does everybody who has met you</s>  i like you myself</s> youve done me personally a thousand kindnesses</s>  but i know very littleof you in spite of our three months acquaintance and that littleisbut you shall judge for yourself</s>  you were in the confidentialemploy of a man who trusted you and you let him betray himself</s> i did</s>  i dont excuse it</s>  the thought of it burns like fire</s>  butit wasnt done maliciously it wasnt done falsely it was doneinconsiderately and when it was done it seemed irrevocable</s>  but itwasnt i could have prevented i could have stooped the mischief and ididnt</s>  i can never outlive that</s> i know said the general relentlessly that you have never attemptedany defence</s>  that has been to your credit with me</s>  it inclined me tooverlook your unwarranted course in writing to my daughter when youtold her you would never see her again</s>  what did you expect me to thinkafter that of your coming back to see her</s>  or didnt you expect me toknow it</s> i expected you to know it i knew she would tell you</s>  but i dontexcuse that either</s>  it was acting a lie to come back</s>  all i can say isthat i had to see her again for one last time</s> and to make sure that it was to be the last time you offered yourselfto her</s> i couldnt help doing that</s> i dont say you could</s>  i dont judge the facts at all</s>  i leave themaltogether to you and you shall say what a man in my position ought tosay to such a man as you have shown yourself</s> no i will say</s>  the door into the adjoining room was flung open andagatha flashed in from it</s> her father looked coldly at her impassioned face</s>  have you beenlistening</s>  he asked</s> i have been hearingoh</s>  as nearly as a man could in bed general triscoe shrugged</s> i suppose i had a right to be in my own room</s>  i couldnt help hearingand i was perfectly astonished at you papa the cruel way you went onafter all youve said about mr</s>  stoller and his getting no more than hedeserved</s> that doesnt justify me burnamy began but she cut him short almostas severely as shehad dealt with her father</s> yes it does</s>  it justifies you perfectly</s>  and his wanting you tofalsify the whole thing afterwards more than justifies you</s> neither of the men attempted anything in reply to her casuistry theyboth looked equally posed by it for different reasons and agatha wenton as vehemently as before addressing herself now to one and now to theother</s> and besides if it didnt justify you what you have done yourselfwould and your never denying it or trying to excuse it makes it thesame as if you hadnt done it as far as you are concerned and that isall i care for</s>  burnamy started as if with the sense of having heardsomething like this before and with surprise at hearing it now and sheflushed a little as she added tremulously and i should never neverblame you for it after that its only trying to wriggle out of thingswhich i despise and youve never done that</s>  and he simply had to comeback she turned to her father and tell me himself just how it was</s> and you said yourself papaor the same as saidthat he had no rightto suppose i was interested in his affairs unless heunlessand ishould never have forgiven him if he hadnt told me then that he thathe had come back because hefelt the way he did</s>  i consider that thatexonerated him for breaking his word completely</s>  if he hadnt brokenhis word i should have thought he had acted very cruelly andandstrangely</s>  and ever since then he has behaved so nobly so honorablyso delicately that i dont believe he would ever have said anythingagainif i hadnt fairly forced him</s>  yes</s>  yes i did</s>  she cried at amovement of remonstrance from burnamy</s>  and i shall always be proud ofyou for it</s>  her father stared steadfastly at her and he only liftedhis eyebrows for change of expression when she went over to whereburnamy stood and put her hand in his with a certain childlikeimpetuosity</s>  and as for the rest she declared everything i have ishis just as everything of his would be mine if i had nothing</s>  or ifhe wishes to take me without anything then he can have me so and ishant be afraid but we can get along somehow</s>  she added i havemanaged without a maid ever since i left home and poverty has noterrors for me</s> lxviii</s> general triscoe submitted to defeat with the patience which soldierslearn</s>  he did not submit amiably that would have been out of characterand perhaps out of reason but burnamy and agatha were both so amiablethat they supplied goodhumor for all</s>  they flaunted their rapture inher fathers face as little as they could but he may have found theirserene satisfaction their settled confidence in their fate as hard tobear as a more boisterous happiness would have been</s> it was agreed among them all that they were to return soon to americaand burnamy was to find some sort of literary or journalistic employmentin new york</s>  she was much surer than he that this could be done withperfect ease but they were of an equal mind that general triscoe wasnot to be disturbed in any of his habits or vexed in the tenor of hisliving and until burnamy was at least selfsupporting there must be notalk of their being married</s> the talk of their being engaged was quite enough for the time</s>  itincluded complete and minute autobiographies on both sides reciprocalanalyses of character a scientifically exhaustive comparison of tastesideas and opinions a profound study of their respective chins noseseyes hands heights complexions moles and freckles with some accountof their several friends</s> in this occupation which was profitably varied by the confession ofwhat they had each thought and felt and dreamt concerning the other atevery instant since they met they passed rapidly the days which thepersistent anxiety of general triscoe interposed before the date oftheir leaving weimar for paris where it was arranged that they shouldspend a month before sailing for new york</s>  burnamy had a notion whichagatha approved of trying for something there on the new yorkparischronicle and if he got it they might not go home at once</s>  his gainsfrom that paper had eked out his copyright from his book and had almostpaid his expenses in getting the material which he had contributedto it</s>  they were not so great however but that his gold reserve wasreduced to less than a hundred dollars counting the silver coinageswhich had remained to him in crossing and recrossing frontiers</s>  he wasat times dimly conscious of his finances but he buoyantly disregardedthe facts as incompatible with his status as agathas betrothed if notunworthy of his character as a lover in the abstract</s> the afternoon before they were to leave weimar they spent mostly in thegarden before the grandducal museum in a conference so important thatwhen it came on to rain at one moment they put up burnamys umbrellaand continued to sit under it rather than interrupt the proceedings evento let agatha go back to the hotel and look after her fathers packing</s> her own had been finished before dinner so as to leave her the wholeafternoon for their conference and to allow her father to remain inundisturbed possession of his room as long as possible</s> what chiefly remained to be put into the generals trunk were his coatsand trousers hanging in the closet and august took these down andcarefully folded and packed them</s>  then to make sure that nothing hadbeen forgotten agatha put a chair into the closet when she came in andstood on it to examine the shelf which stretched above the hooks</s> there seemed at first to be nothing on it and then there seemed to besomething in the further corner which when it was tiptoed for provedto be a bouquet of flowers not so faded as to seem very old the bluesatin ribbon which they were tied up with and which hung down half ayard was of entire freshness except far the dust of the shelf where ithad lain</s> agatha backed out into the room with her find in her hand and examinedit near to and then at arms length</s>  august stood by with a pair of thegenerals trousers lying across his outstretched hands and as agathaabsently looked round at him she caught a light of intelligence inhis eyes which changed her whole psychological relation to the witheredbouquet</s>  till then it had been a lifeless meaningless bunch of flowerswhich some one for no motive had tossed up on that dusty shelf inthe closet</s>  at augusts smile it became something else</s>  still she askedlightly enough was ist loss august</s> his smile deepened and broadened</s>  fur die andere he explained</s> agatha demanded in english what do you mean by feardy ondery</s> oddaw lehdy</s> other lady</s>  august nodded rejoicing in big success and agatha closedthe door into her own room where the general had been put for the timeso as to be spared the annoyance of the packing then she sat down withher hands in her lap and the bouquet in her hands</s>  now augustshe said very calmly i want you to tell meich wunsche sie zu mirsagenwhat other ladywass andere damethese flowers belongedtodiese blumen gehorte zu</s>  verstehen sie</s> august nodded brightly and with german carefully adjusted to agathascapacity and with now and then a word or phrase of english he conveyedthat before she and her herr father had appeared there had been inweimar another american fraulein with her frau mother they had notindeed staid in that hotel but had several times supped there withthe young herr bornahmee who was occupying that room before her herrfather</s>  the young herr had been much about with these american damendriving and walking with them and sometimes dining or supping with themat their hotel the elephant</s>  august had sometimes carried notes to themfrom the young herr and he had gone for the bouquet which the graciousfraulein was holding on the morning of the day that the american damenleft by the train for hanover</s> august was much helped and encouraged throughout by the friendlyintelligence of the gracious fraulein who smiled radiantly in clearingup one dim point after another and who now and then supplied theenglish analogues which he sought in his effort to render his germanmore luminous</s> at the end she returned to the work of packing in which she directedhim and sometimes assisted him with her own hands having put thebouquet on the mantel to leave herself free</s>  she took it up again andcarried it into her own room when she went with august to summon herfather back to his</s>  she bade august say to the young herr if he sawhim that she was going to sup with her father and august gave hermessage to burnamy whom he met on the stairs coming down as he wasgoing up with their tray</s> agatha usually supped with her father but that evening burnamy was lessable than usual to bear her absence in the hotel diningroom and hewent up to a cafe in the town for his supper</s>  he did not stay long andwhen he returned his heart gave a joyful lift at sight of agatha lookingout from her balcony as if she were looking for him</s>  he made her a gayflourishing bow lifting his hat high and she came down to meet himat the hotel door</s>  she had her hat on and jacket over one arm and shejoined him at once for the farewell walk he proposed in what they hadagreed to call their garden</s> she moved a little ahead of him and when they reached the place wherethey always sat she shifted her jacket to the other arm and uncoveredthe hand in which she had been carrying the withered bouquet</s>  here issomething i found in your closet when i was getting papas things out</s> why what is it</s>  he asked innocently as he took it from her</s> a bouquet apparently she answered as he drew the long ribbonsthrough his fingers and looked at the flowers curiously with his headaslant</s> where did you get it</s> on the shelf</s> it seemed a long time before burnamy said with a long sigh as of finalrecollection oh yes and then he said nothing and they did not sitdown but stood looking at each other</s> was it something you got for me and forgot to give me</s>  she asked ina voice which would not have misled a woman but which did its work withthe young man</s> he laughed and said well hardly</s>  the general has been in the roomever since you came</s> oh yes</s>  then perhaps somebody left it there before you had the room</s> burnamy was silent again but at last he said no i flung it up therei had forgotten all about it</s> and you wish me to forget about it too</s>  agatha asked in a gayety oftone that still deceived him</s> it would only be fair</s>  you made me he rejoined and there wassomething so charming in his words and way that she would have beenglad to do it</s> but she governed herself against the temptation and said women are notgood at forgetting at least till they know what</s> oh ill tell you if you want to know he said with a laugh and atthe words shesank provisionally in their accustomed seat</s>  he sat downbeside her but not so near as usual and he waited so long before hebegan that it seemed as if he had forgotten again</s>  why its nothing</s> miss etkins and her mother were here before you came and this is abouquet that i meant to give her at the train when she left</s>  but idecided i wouldnt and i threw it onto the shelf in the closet</s> may i ask why you thought of taking a bouquet to her at the train</s> well she and her motheri had been with them a good deal and ithought it would be civil</s> and why did you decide not to be civil</s> i didnt want it to look like more than civility</s> were they here long</s> about a week</s>  they left just after the marches came</s> agatha seemed not to heed the answer she had exacted</s>  she sat reclinedin the corner of the seat with her head drooping</s>  after an intervalwhich was long to burnamy she began to pull at a ring on the thirdfinger of her left hand absently as if she did not know what she wasdoing but when she had got it off she held it towards burnamy and saidquietly i think you had better have this again and then she rose andmoved slowly and weakly away</s> he had taken the ring mechanically from her and he stood a momentbewildered then he pressed after her</s> agatha do youyou dont meanyes she said without looking round at his face which she knew wasclose to her shoulder</s>  its over</s>  it isnt what youve done</s>  its whatyou are</s>  i believed in you in spite of what you did to that manandyour coming back when you said you wouldntandbut i see now thatwhat you did was you it was your nature and i cant believe in

have changed my mind</s>  i seethat it would never do</s>  i leave you free to follow all the turning andtwisting of your fancy</s>  she spoke rapidly almost breathlessly and shegave him no chance to get out the words that seemed to choke him</s>  shebegan to run but at the door of the hotel she stopped and waited tillhe came stupidly up</s>  i have a favor to ask mr</s>  burnamy</s>  i beg you willnot see me again if you can help it before we go tomorrow</s>  my fatherand i are indebted to you for too many kindnesses and you mustnt takeany more trouble on our account</s>  august can see us off in the morning</s> she nodded quickly and was gone indoors while he was yet strugglingwith his doubt of the reality of what had all so swiftly happened</s> general triscoe was still ignorant of any change in the status to whichhe had reconciled himself with so much difficulty when he came down toget into the omnibus for the train</s>  till then he had been too proudto ask what had become of burnamy though he had wondered but now helooked about and said impatiently i hope that young man isnt going tokeep us waiting</s> agatha was pale and worn with sleeplessness but she said firmly heisnt going papa</s>  i will tell you in the train</s>  august will see to thetickets and the baggage</s> august conspired with the traeger to get them a firstclass compartmentto themselves</s>  but even with the advantages of this seclusion agathasconfidences to her father were not full</s>  she told her father that herengagement was broken for reasons that did not mean anything verywrong in mr</s>  burnamy but that convinced her they could never be happytogether</s>  as she did not give the reasons he found a natural difficultyin accepting them and there was something in the situation whichappealed strongly to his contrarymindedness</s>  partly from this partlyfrom his sense of injury in being obliged so soon to adjust himself tonew conditions and partly from his comfortable feeling of securityfrom an engagement to which his assent had been forced he said i hopeyoure not making a mistake</s> oh no she answered and she attested her conviction by a burst ofsobbing that lasted well on the way to the first stop of the train</s> lxix</s> it would have been always twice as easy to go direct from berlin to thehague through hanover but the marches decided to go by frankfort andthe rhine because they wished to revisit the famous river whichthey remembered from their youth and because they wished to stop atdusseldorf where heinrich heine was born</s>
 without this mrs</s>  march whokept her husband up to his early passion for the poet with a feelingthat she was defending him from age in it said that their silverwedding journey would not be complete and he began himself to thinkthat it would be interesting</s> they took a sleepingcar for frankfort and they woke early as people doin sleepingcars everywhere</s>  march dressed and went out for a cup ofthe same coffee of which sleepingcar buffets have the awful secret ineurope as well as america and for a glimpse of the twilight landscape</s> one gray little town towered and steepled and redroofed within itsmediaeval walls looked as if it would have been warmer in somethingmore</s>  there was a heavy dew if not a light frost over all and inplaces a pale fog began to lift from the low hills</s>  then the sun rosewithout dispersing the cold which was afterwards so severe intheir room at the russischer hof in frankfort that in spite ofthe steamradiators they sat shivering in all their wraps tillbreakfasttime</s> there was no steam on in the radiators of course when they imploredthe portier for at least a lamp to warm their hands by he turned on allthe electric lights without raising the temperature in the slightestdegree</s>  amidst these modern comforts they were so miserable that theyvowed each other to shun as long as they were in germany or atleast while the summer lasted all hotels which were steamheated andelectriclighted</s>  they heated themselves somewhat with their wrathand over their breakfast they relented so far as to suffer themselves acertain interest in the troops of all arms beginning to pass the hotel</s> they were fragments of the great parade which had ended the day beforeand they were now drifting back to their several quarters of the empire</s> many of them were very picturesque and they had for the boys andgirls running before and beside them the charm which armies and circusprocessions have for children everywhere</s>  but their passage filled withcruel anxiety a large old dog whom his master had left harnessed toa milkcart before the hotel door from time to time he lifted up hisvoice and called to the absentee with hoarse deep barks that almostshook him from his feet</s> the day continued blue and bright and cold and the marches gave themorning to a rapid survey of the city glad that it was at least notwet</s>  what afterwards chiefly remained to them was the impression of anold town as quaint almost and as gothic as old hamburg and a newtown handsome and regular and in the sudden arrest of some streetsapparently overbuilt</s>  the modern architectural taste was of courseparisian there is no other taste for the germans but in the prevailingabsence of statues there was a relief from the most oppressivecharacteristic of the imperial capital which was a positive delight</s> some sort of monument to the national victory over france there musthave been but it must have been unusually inoffensive for it left norecord of itself in the travellers consciousness</s>  they were awareof gardened squares and avenues bordered by stately dwellings ofdignified civic edifices and of a vast and splendid railroad stationsuch as the state builds even in minor european cities but such as ourpaternal corporations have not yet given us anywhere in america</s>  theywent to the zoological garden where they heard the customary kalmucksat their public prayers behind a high board fence and as pilgrims fromthe most plutrocratic country in the world march insisted that theymust pay their devoirs at the shrine of the rothschilds whose natalbankinghouse they revered from the outside</s> it was a pity he said that the rothschilds were not on his letterof credit he would have been willing to pay tribute to the geniusof finance in the percentage on at least ten pounds</s>  but he consoledhimself by reflecting that he did not need the money and he consoledmrs</s>  march for their failure to penetrate to the interior of therothschilds birthplace by taking her to see the house where goethewas born</s>  the public is apparently much more expected there and in thefriendly place they were no doubt much more welcome than they wouldhave been in the rothschild house</s>  under that roof they renewed a happymoment of weimar which after the lapse of a week seemed already soremote</s>  they wondered as they mounted the stairs from the basementopening into a clean little court how burnamy was getting on andwhether it had yet come to that understanding between him and agathawhich mrs</s>  march at least had meant to be inevitable</s>  then they becamepart of some such sightseeing retinue as followed the custodian aboutin the goethe horse in weimar and of an emotion indistinguishable fromthat of their fellow sightseers</s>  they could make sure afterwards ofa personal pleasure in a certain prescient classicism of the house</s> it somehow recalled both the goethe houses at weimar and it somehowrecalled italy</s>  it is a separate house of two floors above the entrancewhich opens to a little court or yard and gives access by a decentstairway to the livingrooms</s>  the chief of these is a sufficientlydignified parlor or salon and the most important is the little chamberin the third story where the poet first opened his eyes to the lightwhich he rejoiced in for so long a life and which dying he imploredto be with him more</s>  it is as large as his deathchamber inweimar where he breathed this prayer and it looks down into theitalianlooking court where probably he noticed

at breakfast he asked the waiter what it all meant and hesaid that these were conscripts whose service had expired with the latemanoeuvres and who were now going home</s>  he promised march a

from the steamboat landing to the railroad stationwhere they were to get their train for dusseldorf an hour later</s>  thestation swarmed with travellers eating and drinking and smoking butthey escaped from it for a precious half of their golden hour and gavethe time to the great cathedral which was built a thousand years agojust round the corner from the station and is therefore very

answered boldly</s> well you will be sick she said and he crept back into bed again</s> they had sat up late talking in a glad excitement</s>  but he woke earlyas an elderly man is apt to do after

provision man corroborated the tablet but couldnot understand their wish to go up stairs</s>  he did not try to preventthem however and they climbed to the first floor above where aplacard on the door declared it private and implored them not to knock</s> was this the outcome of the inmates despair from the intrusion of otherpilgrims who had wised to see the heine dwellingrooms</s>  they durst notknock and ask so much and they sadly descended to the groundfloorwhere they found a butcher boy of much greater apparent intelligencethan the butcher himself who told them that the building in front wasas new as it looked and the house where heine was really born was theold house in the rear</s>  he showed them this house across a little courtpatched with mangy grass and lilacbushes and when they wished to visitit he led the way</s>  the place was strewn both underfoot and overhead withfeathers it had once been all a garden out to the street the boy saidbut from these feathers as

were taken down from itsdoorway</s> the rathhaus is a saladdressing of german gothic and french rococo asto its architectural style and is charming in its way but the marcheswere in the marketplace

marketwoman and then dashed away before she could frame a protestagainst the indignity</s>  from this incident they philosophized that theboys of dusseldorf are as mischievous at the end of the century asthey were at the beginning and they felt the fascination that such abounteous unkempt old marketplace must have for the boys of any period</s> there were magnificent vegetables of all sorts

greatest german lyrist bywhich the poet might have profited if he had been present</s>  he contendedthat it was not altogether an effect of hohenzollern pride which couldnot suffer a joke or two from the archhumorist but that heine hadsaid things of germany herself which germans might well have foundunpardonable</s>  he concluded that it would not do to be perfectly frankwith ones own country</s>  though to be sure there would always be thequestion whether the jewborn heine had even a stepfatherland in thegermany he loved so tenderly and mocked so pitilessly</s>  he had to ownthat if he were a negro poet he would not feel bound to measure termsin speaking of america and he would not feel that his fame was in herkeeping</s> upon the whole he blamed heine less than germany and he accused her oftaking a shabby revenge in trying to forget him in the heat of hisresentment that there should be no record of heine in the city wherehe was born march came near ignoring himself the fact that the poetfreiligrath was also born there</s>  as for the famous dusseldorf school ofpainting which once filled the world with the worst art he rejoicedthat it was now so dead and he grudged the glance

 she stopped herself with a look at her husband and askedgently do you want to stay</s> well i dont know he answered vaguely</s>  the fact was he was sick oftravel and of leisure he was longing to be at home and at work again</s> but if there was to be any selfsacrifice which could be had as itwere at a bargain which could be fairly divided between them andleave him the self and her the sacrifice

little from the rough weather that she was an example tomany robust matrons who filled the ladies cabin with the noise of theiranguish during the night</s>  she would have insisted upon taking the firsttrain up to london if march had not represented that this would notexpedite the sailing of the cupania and that she might as well stay theforenoon at the convenient railway hotel and rest</s>  it was not quite hisideal of repose that the first people they saw in the coffeeroom whenthey went to breakfast should be kenby and rose adding who werehaving their tea and toast and eggs together in the greatest apparentgoodfellowship</s>  he saw his wife shrink back involuntarily from theencounter but this was only to gather force for it and the next momentshe was upon them in all the joy of the surprise</s>  then march allowedhimself to be as glad as the others both seemed and he shook hands withkenby while his wife kissed rose and they all talked at once</s>  in theconfusion of tongues it was presently intelligible that mrs</s>  kenbywas going to be down in a few minutes and kenby took march into hisconfidence with a smile which was almost a wink in explaining that heknew how it was with the ladies</s>  he said that rose and he usually gotdown to breakfast first and when he had listened inattentively to mrs</s> marchs apology for being on her way home he told her that she waslucky not to have gone to schevleningen where she and march would havefrozen to death</s>  he said that they were going to spend september at alittle place on the english coast near by where he had been the daybefore with rose to look at lodgings and where you could bathe allthrough the month</s>  he was not surprised that the marches were goinghome and said well that was their original plan wasnt it</s> mrs</s>  kenby appearing upon this pretended to know better after theoutburst of joyful greeting with the marches and intelligently remindedkenby that he knew the marches had intended to pass the winter in paris</s> she was looking extremely pretty but she wished only to make them seehow well rose was looking and she put her arm round his shoulders asshe spoke schevleningen had done wonders for him but it was fearfullycold there and now they were expecting everything from westgate whereshe advised march to come too for his aftercure she recollected intime to say she forgot they were on their way home</s>  she added that shedid not know when she should return she was merely a passenger nowshe left everything to the men of the family</s>  she had in fact theair of having thrown off every responsibility but in supremacy notsubmission</s>  she was always ordering kenby about she sent him for herhandkerchief and her rings which she had left either in the tray ofher trunk or on the pincushion or on the washstand or somewhere andforbade him to come back without them</s>  he asked for her keys and thenwith a joyful scream she owned that she had left the doorkey in thedoor and the whole bunch of trunkkeys in her trunk and kenby treatedit all as the greatest joke rose too seemed to think that kenby wouldmake everything come right and he had lost that look of anxiety whichhe used to have at the most he showed a friendly sympathy for kenbyfor whose sake he seemed mortified at her</s>  he was unable to regard hismother as the delightful joke which she appeared to kenby but thatwas merely temperamental and he was never distressed except when shebehaved with unreasonable caprice at kenbys cost</s> as for kenby himself he betrayed no dissatisfaction with his fate tomarch</s>  he perhaps no longer regarded his wife as that strong characterwhich he had sometimes wearied march by celebrating but she was stillthe most brilliant intelligence and her charm seemed only to have grownwith his perception of its wilful limitations</s>  he did not want to talkabout her so much he wanted rather to talk about rose his health hiseducation his nature and what was best to do for him</s>  the two were onterms of a confidence and affection which perpetually amused mrs</s> kenby but which left the sympathetic witness nothing to desire in theirrelation</s> they all came to the train when the marches started up to london andstood waving to them as they pulled out of the station</s>  well i cantsee but thats all right he said as he sank back in his seat with asigh of relief</s>  i never supposed we should get out of their marriagehalf so well and i dont feel that you quite made the match either mydear</s> she was forced to agree with him that the kenbys seemed happy togetherand that there was nothing to fear for rose in their happiness</s>  he wouldbe as tenderly cared for by kenby as he could have been by his motherand far more judiciously</s>  she owned that she had trembled for him tillshe had seen them all together and now she should never tremble again</s> well</s>  march prompted at a certain inconclusiveness in her tone ratherthan her words</s> well you can see that it isnt ideal</s> why isnt it ideal</s>  i suppose you think that the marriage ofburnamy and agatha triscoe will be ideal with their ignorances andinexperiences and illusions</s> yes</s>  its the illusions no marriage can be perfect without them andat their age the kenbys cant have them</s> kenby is a solid mass of illusion</s>  and i believe that people can go andget as many new illusions as they want whenever theyve lost their oldones</s> yes but the new illusions wont wear so well and in marriage youwant illusions that will last</s>  no you neednt talk to me</s>  its all verywell but it isnt ideal</s> march laughed</s>  ideal</s>  what is ideal</s> going home</s>  she said with such passion that he had not the heart topoint out that they were merely returning to their old duties caresand pains with the wornout illusion that these would be altogetherdifferent when they took them up again</s> lxxiii</s> in fulfilment of another ideal mrs</s>  march took straightway to her berthwhen she got on board the cupania and to her husbands admiration sheremained there till the day before they reached new york</s>  her theorywas that the complete rest would do more than anything else to calm hershaken nerves and she did not admit into her calculations the chancesof adverse weather which march would not suggest as probable in the lastweek in september</s>  the event justified her unconscious faith</s>  the shipsrun was of unparalled swiftness even for the cupania and of unparalledsmoothness</s>  for days the sea was as sleek as oil the racks were neveron the tables once the voyage was of the sort which those who make itno more believe in at the time than those whom they afterwards weary inboasting of it</s> the ship was very full but mrs</s>  march did not show the slightestcuriosity to know who her fellowpassengers were</s>  she said that shewished to be let perfectly alone even by her own emotions and forthis reason she forbade march to bring her a list of the passengers tillafter they had left queenstown lest it should be too exciting</s>  he didnot take the trouble to look it up therefore and the first night outhe saw no one whom he knew at dinner but the next morning at breakfasthe found himself to his great satisfaction at the same table with theeltwins</s>  they were so much at ease with him that even mrs</s>  eltwintook part in the talk and told him how they had spent the time of herhusbands rigorous aftercure in switzerland and now he was going homemuch better than they had expected</s>  she said they had rather thoughtof spending the winter in europe but had given it up because they wereboth a little homesick</s>  march confessed that this was exactly the casewith his wife and himself and he had to add that mrs</s>  march was notvery well otherwise and he should be glad to be at home on her account</s> the recurrence of the word home seemed to deepen eltwins habitualgloom and mrs</s>  eltwin hastened to leave the subject of their returnfor inquiry into mrs</s>  marchs condition her interest did not so farovercome her shyness that she ventured to propose a visit to her andmarch found that the fact of the eltwins presence on board did notagitate his wife</s>  it seemed rather to comfort her and she said shehoped he would see all he could of the poor old things</s>  she asked ifhe had met any one else he knew and he was able to tell her that thereseemed to be a good many swells on board and this cheered her verymuch though he did not know them she liked to be near the rose thoughit was not a flower that she really cared for</s> she did not ask who the swells were and march took no trouble to findout</s>  he took no trouble to get a passengerlist and he had the moretrouble when he tried at last the lists seemed to have all vanishedas they have a habit of doing after the first day the one that he madeinterest for with the head steward was a secondhand copy and had noone he knew in it but the eltwins</s>  the social solitude however wasrather favorable to certain other impressions</s>  there seemed even moreelderly people than there were on the norumbia the human atmosphere wasgray and sober there was nothing of the gay expansion of the outwardvoyage there was little talking or laughing among those autumnal menwho were going seriously and anxiously home with faces fiercely set forthe coming grapple or necks meekly bowed for the yoke</s>  they had eatentheir cake and it had been good but there remained a discomfort in thedigestion</s>  they sat about in silence and march fancied that the flownsummer was as dreamlike to each of them as it now was to him</s>  he hatedto be of their dreary company but spiritually he knew that he was ofit and he vainly turned to cheer himself with the younger passengers</s> some matrons who went about clad in furs amused him for they must havebeen unpleasantly warm in their jackets and boas nothing but the hopeof being able to tell the customs inspector with a good conscience thatthe things had been worn would have sustained one lady draped from headto foot in astrakhan</s> they were all getting themselves ready for the fray or the play of thecoming winter but there seemed nothing joyous in the preparation</s>  therewere many young girls as there always are everywhere but there werenot many young men and such as there were kept to the smokingroom</s> there was no sign of flirtation among them he would have given much fora moment of the pivotal girl to see whether she could have brightenedthose gloomy surfaces with her impartial lamp</s>  march wished that hecould have brought some report from the outer world to cheer his wifeas he descended to their stateroom</s>  they had taken what they could getat the eleventh hour and they had got no such ideal room as they had inthe norumbia</s>  it was as mrs</s>  march graphically said a basement room</s> it was on the north side of the ship which is a cold exposure and ifthere had been any sun it could not have got into their window whichwas half the time under water</s>  the green waves laced with foam hissedas they ran across the port and the electric fan in the corridor moanedlike the wind in a gable</s> he felt a sinking of the heart as he pushed the stateroom door openand looked at his wife lying with her face

happy summer</s>  it hasbeen one long joy one continued triumph</s>  but it was too late we weretoo old and its broken me</s> the time had been when he would have attempted comfort when he wouldhave tried mocking but that time was long past he could only prayinwardly for some sort of diversion but what it was to be in theirbarren circumstance he was obliged to leave altogether to providence</s>  heventured pending an answer to his prayers upon the question dont youthink id better see the doctor and get you some sort of tonic</s> she suddenly turned and faced him</s>  the doctor</s>  why im not sickbasil</s>  if you can see the purser and get our rooms changed or dosomething to stop those waves from slapping against that horribleblinking oneeyed window you can save my life but no tonic is going tohelp me</s> she turned her face from him again and buried it in the bedclotheswhile he looked desperately at the racing waves and the port thatseemed to open and shut like a weary eye</s> oh go away</s>  she implored</s>  i shall be better presently but if youstand there like thatgo and see if you cant get some other roomwhere i neednt feel as if i were drowning all the way over</s> he obeyed so far as to go away at once and having once started hedid not stop short of the pursers office</s>  he made an excuse of gettinggreenbacks for some english banknotes and then he said casually thathe supposed there would be no chance of having his room on the lowerdeck changed for something a little less intimate with the sea</s>  thepurser was not there to take the humorous view but he conceived thatmarch wanted something higher up and he was able to offer him a roomof those on the promenade where he had seen swells going in and outfor six hundred dollars</s>  march did not blench but said he would get hiswife to look at it with him and then he went out somewhat dizzily totake counsel with himself how he should put the matter to her</s>  she wouldbe sure to ask what the price of the new room would be and he debatedwhether to take it and tell her some kindly lie about it or trust tothe bracing effect of the sum named in helping restore the lost balanceof her nerves</s>  he was not so rich that he could throw six hundreddollars away but there might be worse things and he walked up and downthinking</s>  all at once it flashed upon him that he had better see thedoctor anyway and find out whether there were not some last hope inmedicine before he took the desperate step before him</s>  he turned in halfhis course and ran into a lady who had just emerged from the door ofthe promenade laden with wraps and who dropped them all and clutchedhim to save herself from falling</s> why mr</s>  march</s>  she shrieked</s> miss triscoe</s>  he returned in the astonishment which he shared withher to the extent of letting the shawls he had knocked from her hold liebetween them till she began to pick them up herself</s>  then he joined herand in the relief of

run down to liverpool on the chance of gettingberths</s>  beyond this she was not definite and there was an absenceof burnamy not only from her company but from her conversation whichmystified march through all his selfish preoccupations with his wife</s> she was a girl who had her reserves but for a girl who had so latelyand rapturously written them of her engagement there was a silenceconcerning her betrothed that had almost positive quality</s>  with hislonging to try miss triscoe upon mrs</s>  marchs malady as a remedialagent he had now the desire to try mrs</s>  march upon miss triscoesmystery as a solvent</s>  she stood talking to him and refusing to sit downand be wrapped up in the chair next her father</s>  she said that if he weregoing to ask mrs</s>  march to

right</s>  but now isabel theres something ive gotto tell you</s>  youd find it out and youd better know it at once</s> she turned her face and asked sternly what is it</s> then he said with an almost

he said it had gone frombad to worse with him</s>  at weimar he had taken to his bed and merelyescaped from it with his life</s>  then they had tried schevleningen for aweek where he said in a tone of some injury they had rather thoughtthey might find them the marches</s>  the air had been poison to him andthey had come over to england with some notion of bournemouth butthe doctor in london had thought not and urged their going home</s>  alleurope is damp you know and dark as a pocket in winter he ended</s> there had been nothing about burnamy and march decided that he mustwait to see his wife if he wished to know anything when the generalwho had been silent twisted his head towards him and said withoutregard to the context it was complicated at weimar by that youngman in the most devilish way</s>  did my daughter write to mrs</s>  marchaboutwell it came to nothing after all and i dont understand howto this day</s>  i doubt if they do</s>  it was some sort of quarrel i suppose</s> i wasnt consulted in the matter either way</s>  it appears that parents arenot consulted in these trifling affairs nowadays</s>  he had married hisdaughters mother in open defiance of her father but in the glare ofhis daughters wilfulness this fact had whitened into pious obedience</s> i dare say i shall be told byandby and shall be expected to approveof the result</s> a fancy possessed march that by operation of temperamental laws generaltriscoe was no more satisfied with burnamys final rejection than withhis acceptance</s>  if the engagement was ever to be renewed it might beanother thing but as it stood march divined a certain favor for theyoung man in the generals attitude</s>  but the affair was altogether toodelicate for comment the generals aristocratic

say against him unless inthat business with that manwhat was his name</s> stoller</s>  march prompted</s>  i dont excuse him in that but i dontblame him so much either</s>  if punishment means atonement he had theopportunity of making that right very suddenly and if pardon meansexpunction then i dont see why that offence hasnt been pretty wellwiped out</s> those things are not so simple as they used to seem said the generalwith a seriousness beyond his wont in things that did not immediatelyconcern his own comfort or advantage</s> lxxvi</s> in the mean time mrs</s>  march and miss

kept myselfrespect and as it was i had the greatest difficulty and he oughtto have seen it</s>  of course he said afterwards that he didnt see it</s>  butwhenwhen i found out that she had been in

march watched her from her pillow keeping the girlsunoccupied hand in her own and softly pressing it till the storm waspast sufficiently to allow her to be heard</s> then she said men are very

vein of philosophy spare but sweetwhich march liked he liked also the meekness which had come throughsorrow upon a spirit which had once been proud</s> they had both the elderly mans habit of early rising and they usuallyfound themselves together waiting impatiently for the cup of coffeeingenuously bad which they served on the cupania not earlier than halfpast six in strict observance of a rule of the line discouraging topeople of their habits</s>  march admired the vileness of the decoctionwhich he said could not be got anywhere out of the british empire andhe asked eltwin the first morning if he had noticed how instantly onthe channel boat they had dropped to it and to the sour heavy soddenbritish bread from the spirited and airy continental tradition ofcoffee and rolls</s> the major confessed that he was no great hand to notice such things andhe said he supposed that if the line had never lost a passenger and gotyou to new york in six days it had a right to feed you as it pleasedhe surmised that if they could get their airing outside before they tooktheir coffee it would give the coffee a chance to taste better andthis was what they afterwards did</s>

really looked to march like a good chance for him oneltwins showing but he was not confident of burnamys turning up verysoon and he gave the major a pretty clear notion why by entering intothe young

theirsettlement in major eltwins town under social conditions that implied ahabit of spending the summer evenings on their front porch</s>  while hewas doing this she showered him with questions and conjectures andrequisitions in which nothing but the impossibility of going ashoresaved him from the instant devotion of all his energies to a worldwideinquiry into burnamys whereabouts</s> the next morning he was up before major eltwin got out and found thesecondcabin passengers free of the firstcabin promenade at an hourwhen their superiors were not using it</s>  as he watched these inferiorsdecentlooking wellclad men and women enjoying their privilege witha furtive air and with stolen glances at him he asked himself in whatsort he was their superior till the inquiry grew painful</s>  then he rosefrom his chair and made his way to the place where the material barrierbetween them was lifted and interested himself in a few of them whoseemed too proud to avail themselves of his society on the terms made</s>  afigure seized his attention with a sudden fascination of conjecture andrejection the figure of a tall young man who came out on the promenadeand without looking round walked swiftly away to the bow of the shipand stood there looking down at the water in an attitude which wasbewilderingly familiar</s>  his movement his posture his dress evenwas that of burnamy and march after a first flush of pleasure felta sickening repulsion in the notion of his presence</s>  it would have beensuch a cheap performance on the part of life which has all sortsof chances at command and need not descend to the poor tricks ofsecondrate fiction and he accused burnamy of a complicity in the badtaste of the affair though he realized when he reflected that if itwere really burnamy he must have sailed in as much unconsciousness ofthe triscoes as he himself had done</s>  he had probably got out of moneyand had hurried home while he had still enough to pay the secondcabinfare on the first boat back</s>  clearly he was not to blame but life wasto blame for such a shabby device and march felt this so keenly thathe wished to turn from the situation and have nothing to do with it</s> he kept moving toward him drawn by the fatal attraction and at a fewpaces distance the young man whirled about and showed him the face of astranger</s> march made some witless remark on the rapid course of the ship as itcut its way through the water of the bow the stranger answered with astrong lancashire accent and in the talk which followed he said he wasgoing out to see the cottonmills at fall river and new bedford and heseemed hopeful of some advice or information from march then he said hemust go and try to get his missus out march understood him to meanhis wife and he hurried down to his own to whom he related hishairbreadth escape from burnamy</s> i dont call it an escape at all</s>  she declared</s>  i call it thegreatest possible misfortune</s>  if

seamanship seemed to be done after dark or in those earlyhours when march found the stewards cleaning the stairs and thesailors scouring the promenades</s>  he made little acquaintance with hisfellowpassengers</s>  one morning he almost spoke with an old quaker ladywhom he joined in looking at the niagara flood which poured from thechurning screws but he did not quite get the words

way up the narrowsand into the north river where the flare of lights from the crazysteeps and cliffs of architecture on the new york shore seemed apersistence of the last fourth of july

grand army button like his own in themajors lapel and had marked his fellowveterans paper with the mysticsign which procures for the bearer the honor of being promptly treatedas a smuggler while the

rulingwhich obliged him to pay duty on his own purchases in excess of thehundreddollar limit though his daughter had brought nothing and theyjointly came far within the limit for two</s> he found that the triscoes were going to a quiet old hotel on the wayto stuyvesant square quite in his own neighborhood and he quicklyarranged for all the ladies and the general to drive together while hewas to
