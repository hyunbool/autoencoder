mr</s>  arbuton to have been themeans of a mistake to you today</s> and i was dreadfully ashamed to make you the victim of my blunderanswered miss ellison penitently and a little silence ensued</s>  then asif she had suddenly been able to alienate the case and see it apartfrom herself in its unmanageable absurdity she broke into a confidinglaugh very like her cousins and said why its one of the

like it to happen again</s> mr</s>  arbuton had no sooner made this speech which he thought neat thanhe was vexed with himself for having made it since nothing was furtherfrom his purpose than a flirtation</s>  but the dark vicinity the younggirls prettiness the apparent freshness and reliance on his sympathyfrom which her frankness came were too much he tried to congeal againand ended in some feebleness about the scenery which was indeed verylonely and wild after the boat started up the saguenay leaving the fewlights of tadoussac to blink and fail behind her</s>  he had an absurd senseof being alone in the world there with the young lady and he sufferedhimself to enjoy the situation which was as perfectly safe as anythingcould be</s>  he and miss ellison had both come on from

i dont think it needs any help from me replied the young girl as ifthe tone of her companion had patronized and piqued her</s>  she turned asshe spoke and looked up the sad lonely river</s>  the moon was making itsveiled face seen through the gray heaven and touching the black streamwith hints of melancholy light</s>  on either hand the uninhabitable shorerose in desolate grandeur friendless heights of rock with a thincovering of pines seen in dim outline along their tops and deepeninginto the solid dark of hollows and ravines upon their sides</s>  the cry ofsome wild bird struck through the silence of which the noise of thesteamer had grown to be a part and echoed away to nothing</s>  then fromthe saloon there came on a sudden the notes of a song and miss ellisonled the way within

navigation for the larger steamers</s>
 the long line of sullenhills had fallen away and the morning sun shone warm on what in afriendlier climate would have been a very lovely landscape</s>  the bay wasan irregular oval with shores that rose in bold but not lofty heightson one side while on the other lay a narrow plain with two villagesclinging about the road that followed the crescent beach and liftingeach the slender tinclad spire of its church to sparkle in the sun</s>
at the head of the bay was a mountainous top and along its waters weremasses of rocks gayly painted with lichens and stained with metallictints of orange and scarlet</s>  the unchanging growth of stunted pines wasthe only forest in sight though haha bay is a famous lumbering portand some schooners now lay there receiving cargoes of odorous pineplank</s>  the steamboatwharf was all astir with the liveliest toil andleisure</s>  the boat was taking on wood which was brought in wheelbarrowsto the top of the steep smooth gangwayplanking where the habitantin charge planted his broad feet for the downward slide and was hurledaboard more or less en masse by the fierce velocity of his heavyladenwheelbarrow</s>
 amidst the confusion and hazard of this feat a processionof other habitans marched aboard each one bearing under his arm acoffinshaped wooden box</s>  the rising fear of colonel ellison that theseboxes represented the loss of the whole infant population of haha baywas checked by the reflection that the region could not have produced somany children and calmed altogether by the purser who said that theywere full of huckleberries and that colonel ellison could have as manyas he liked for fifteen cents a bushel</s>  this gave him a keen sense ofthe poverty of the land and he bought of the boys who came aboard suchabundance of wild red raspberries in all manner of birchbark canoesand goblets and cornucopias that he was obliged to make presents ofthem to the very dealers whose stock he had exhausted and he was intreaty with the local halfwitvery fine with a hunchback and amassive wen on one side of his headto take charity in the wild fruitsof his native province when the crowd about him was gently opened by aperson who advanced with a flourishing bow and a sprightly goodmorning good morning sir</s>  how do you do</s>  asked colonel ellison butthe other intent on business

gone as long as you will for one shilling andsixpence</s>  i will show you all that there is to be seen about the placeand the beautiful view of the bay from the top of the mountain</s>  but itis elegant you know i can assure you</s> the speaker was so fluent of his english he had such an audaciouswidebranching mustache such a twinkle in his left eyewhich wore itslid in a careless slouching fashionthat the heart of man naturallyclove to him and colonel ellison agreed on the spot to make theproposed promenade for himself and both his ladies of whom he wentjoyfully in search</s>  he found them at the stern of the boat admiring thewild scenery and looking fresh as the morn and as the season fair</s> he was not a close observer and of his wifes wardrobe he had theignorance of a good husband who as soon as the pang of paying for herdresses is past forgets whatever she has but he could not help seeingthat some gayeties of costume which he had dimly associated with hiswife now enhanced the charms of his cousins nice little face andfigure</s>  a scarf of lively hue carelessly tied about the throat to keepoff the morning chill a prettier ribbon a more stylish jacket thanmiss

of mr</s>  arbuton</s>  but i oughtperhaps to explain mrs</s>  ellisons motives better than they can be madeto appear in her conduct</s>  she cared nothing for mr</s>  arbuton and she hadno logical wish to see kitty in love with him</s>  but here were two youngpeople thrown somewhat romantically together mrs</s>  ellison was a bornmatchmaker and to have refrained from promoting their betteracquaintance in the interest of abstract matrimony was what never couldhave entered into her thought or desire</s>  her whole being closed for thetime about this purpose her heart always warm

capable of adding anothermarriage to the world</s>  i hope the reader finds nothing vulgar orunbecoming in this for i do not it was an enthusiasm pure and simplea beautiful and unselfish abandon and i

to prepare for him or in other wordsthat women cannot marry women</s> i am not going to be so rash as try to depict mrs</s>  ellisons arts forthen indeed i should make her appear the clumsy conspirator she wasnot and should merely convict myself of ignorance of such matters</s> whether mr</s>  arbuton was ever aware of them i am not sure as a man hewas of course obtuse and blind but then on the other hand he hadseen far more of the world than mrs</s>  ellison and she may have beenclear as day to him</s>  probably though he did not detect any design hecould not have conceived of such a thing in a person with whom he hadbeen so irregularly made acquainted and to whom he felt himself sohopelessly superior</s>  a film of ice such as in autumn you find casing thestill pools early in the frosty mornings had gathered upon his mannerover night but it thawed under the greetings of the others and hejumped actively out of the vehicle to offer the ladies their choice ofseats</s>  when all was arranged he found himself at mrs</s>  ellisons sidefor kitty had somewhat eagerly climbed to the front seat with thecolonel</s>  in these circumstances it was pure zeal that sustained mrs</s> ellison in the flattering constancy with which she babbled on to mr</s> arbuton and refrained from openly resenting kittys contumacy</s> as the wagon began to ascend the hill the road was so rough that thesprings smote together with pitiless jolts and the ladies uttered someirrepressible moans</s>  never mind my dear said the colonel turningabout to his wife weve got all the english there is at haha bay anyway</s>  whereupon the driver gave him a wink of sudden liking andgoodfellowship</s>  at the same time his tongue was loosed and he began totalk of himself</s>  you see my dog how he leaps

they had been slowly climbing the mountain road from which on eitherhand the pasturelands fell away in long irregular knolls and hollows</s> the tops were quite barren but in the little vales despite the stonesa short grass grew very thick and tenderly green and groups of kinetinkled their soft bells in a sweet desultory assonance as they croppedthe herbage</s>  below the bay filled the oval of the hills with its sunnyexpanse and the white steamer where she lay beside the busy wharf andthe black lumberships gave their variety to the pretty scene whichwas completed by the picturesque villages on the shore</s>  it was a verysimple sight but somehow very touching as if the soft spectacle werebut a respite from desolation and solitude as indeed it was</s> mr</s>  arbuton must have been talking of travel elsewhere for now he saidto mrs</s>  ellison this looks like a bit of norway the bay yonder mightvery well be a fjord of the northern sea</s> mrs</s>  ellison murmured her sense of obligation to the bay the fjord andmr</s>  arbuton for their complaisance and kitty remembered that he hadsomewhat snubbed her the night before for attributing any suggestivegrace to the native scenery</s>  then youve really found something in anamerican landscape</s>  i suppose we ought to congratulate it she said insmiling enjoyment of her triumph</s> the colonel looked at her with eyes of humorous question mrs</s>  ellisonlooked blank and mr</s>  arbuton having quite forgotten what he had saidto provoke this comment now looked puzzled and answered nothing for hehad this trait also in common with the sort of englishman for whom hewas taken that he never helped out your conversational venture but ifhe failed to respond inwardly left you with your unaccepted remark uponyour hands as it were</s>  in his silence kitty fell a prey to very evilthoughts of him for it made her harmless sally look like a blunderingattack upon him</s>  but just then the driver came to her rescue he saidgentlemen and ladies this is the end of the mountain promenade andturning his horses head drove rapidly back to the village</s> at the foot of the hill they came again to the church and hispassengers wanted to get out and look into it</s>  o certainly said heit isnt finished yet but you can say as many prayers as you like init</s> the church was decent and clean like most canadian churches and atthis early hour there was a good number of the villagers at theirdevotions</s>  the lithographic pictures of the stations to calvary were ofcourse on its walls and there was the ordinary tawdriness of paint andcarving about the high altar</s> i dont like to see these things said mrs</s>  ellison</s>  it really seemsto savor of idolatry</s>  dont you think so mr</s>  arbuton</s> well i dont know</s>  i doubt if theyre the sort of people to be hurt byit</s> they need a good stout faith in cold climates i can tell you saidthe colonel</s>  it helps to keep them warm</s>  the broad church would be toofull of draughts up here</s>  they want something snug and tight</s>  justimagine one of these poor devils listening to a liberal sermon aboutbirds and fruits

him with aneye of cold uncompassionate inspection as if he were trying it by astandard of taste and on the whole finding the poor little churchvulgar</s> when they mounted to their places again the talk fell entirely to thecolonel who as his wont was got what information he could out of thedriver</s>  it appeared in spite of his theory that they were not all goodcatholics at haha bay</s>  this chap for example said the frenchmantouching himself on the breast and using the slang he must have pickedup from american travellers is no catholicnot much</s>  he has made toomany studies to care for religion</s>  theres a large french party sir incanada thats opposed to the priests and in favor of annexation</s> he satisfied the colonels utmost curiosity discoursing as he drove bythe logbuilt cottages which were now and then sheathed in birchbarkupon the local affairs and the character and history of such of hisfellowvillagers as they met</s>  he knew the pretty girls upon the streetand saluted them by name interrupting himself with these courtesies inthe lecture he was giving the colonel on life at haha bay</s>  there wasonly one brick house which he had built himself but had been obligedto sell in a season unfavorable for wild beasts and the other edificesdropped through the social scale to some picturesque barns thatched withstraw</s>  these he excused to his americans but added that the ungainlythatch was sometimes useful in saving the lives of the cattle toward theend of an unusually long hard winter</s> and the people asked the colonel what do they do in the winter topass the time</s> draw the wood smoke the pipe court the ladies</s> but wouldnt you liketo see the inside of one of our poor cottages</s>  i shall be very proud tohave you look at mine and to have you drink a glass of milk from mycows</s>  i am sorry that i cannot offer you brandy but theres none to bebought in the place</s> dont speak of it</s>  for an eyeopener there is nothing like a glass ofmilk gayly answered the colonel</s> they entered the best room of the housewide lowceiled dimly lit bytwo small windows and fortified against the winter by a huge canadastove of castiron</s>  it was rude but neat and had an air of decentcomfort</s>  through the window appeared a very little vegetable garden witha border of the hardiest flowers</s>  the large beans there explained thehost are for soup and coffee</s>  my corn he said pointing out somerows of dwarfish maize has escaped the early august frosts and so iexpect to have some roastingears yet this summer</s> well it isnt exactly what youd call an inviting climate is it</s> asked the colonel</s> the canadian seemed a hard little man but he answered now with a kindof pathos its cruel</s>  i came here when it was all bush</s>  twenty years ihave lived here and it has not been worth while</s>  if it was to do overagain i should rather not live anywhere</s>  i was born in quebec hesaid as if to explain that he was used to mild

bears in the bush sir hesaid to the colonel and you might easily kill one</s> but then i should be helping to spoil your trade in wild beastsreplied the colonel laughing</s> mr</s>  arbuton looked like one who might be very tired of this</s>  he made nosign of interest either in the early glooms and privations or the summerbears of haha bay</s>  he sat in the quaint parlor with his hat on hisknee in the decorous and patient attitude of a gentleman making a call</s> he had no feeling kitty said to herself but that is a matter aboutwhich we can easily be wrong</s>  it was rather to be said of mr</s>  arbutonthat he had always shrunk from knowledge of things outside of a verynarrow world and that he had not a ready imagination</s>  moreover he hada personal dislike as i may call it of poverty and he did not enjoythis poverty as she did because it was strange and suggestive thoughdoubtless he would have done as much to relieve distress</s> rather too much of his autobiography he said to kitty as he waitedoutside the door with her while the canadian quieted his dog which wasagain keeping himself in practice of catching the moose by makingvicious leaps at the horses nose</s>  the egotism of that kind of peopleis always so aggressive</s>  but i suppose hes in the habit of throwinghimself upon the sympathy of summer visitors in this way</s>  you cantoffer a man so little as shilling and sixpence whos taken you into hisconfidence</s>  did you find enough that was novel in his place to justifyhim in bringing us here miss ellison</s>  he asked with an air he had oftaking you of course to be of his mind and which equally offended youwhether you were so or not</s> every face that they had seen in their drive had told its pathetic storyto kitty every cottage that they passed she had entered in thought anddreamed out its humble drama</s>  what their host had said gave breath andcolor to her fancies of the struggle of life there and she was startledand shocked when this cold doubt was cast upon the sympathetic tints ofher picture</s>  she did not know what to say at first she looked at mr</s> arbuton with a sudden glance of embarrassment and trouble then sheanswered i was very much interested</s>  i dont agree with you ibelieve which when she heard it seemed a resentful little speechand made her willing for some occasion to soften its effect</s>  but nothingoccurred to her during the brief drive back to the boat save the factthat the morning air was delicious</s> yes but rather cool said mr</s>  arbuton whose feelings apparently hadnot needed any balm and the talk fell again to the others</s> on the pier he helped her down from the wagon for the colonel wasintent on something the driver was saying and then offered his hand tomrs</s>  ellison</s> she sprang from her place but stumbled slightly and when she touchedthe ground i believe i turned my foot a little she said with alaugh</s>  its nothing of course and fainted in his arms</s> kitty gave a cry of alarm and the next instant the colonel had relievedmr</s>  arbuton</s>  it was a scene and nothing could have annoyed him morethan this tumult which poor mrs</s>  ellisons misfortune occasioned amongthe bystanding habitans and deckhands and the passengers eagerlycraning forward over the bulwarks and running ashore to see what thematter was</s>  few men know just how to offer those little offices ofhelpfulness which such emergencies demand and mr</s>  arbuton could donothing after he was rid of his burden he hovered anxiously anduselessly about while mrs</s>  ellison was carried to an airy position onthe bow of the boat where in a few minutes he had the greatsatisfaction of seeing her open her eyes</s>  it was not the moment for himto speak and he walked somewhat guiltily away with the dispersingcrowd</s> mrs</s>  ellison addressed her first words to pale kitty at her side</s>  youcan have all my things now she said as if it were a clause in herwill and

head like a mother wondering what will become of ahelpless child during her disability in fact she was mentally weighingthe advantages of her wardrobe which kitty would now fully enjoyagainst the loss of the friendly strategy which she would now lack</s> helpless to decide the matter she heaved a sigh</s> but fanny you wont expect to travel in a dressinggown</s> indeed i wish i knew whether i could travel in anything or not</s> but the next twentyfour hours will show</s>  if it swells up i shall haveto rest awhile at quebec and if it doesnt there may be somethinginternal</s>  ive read of

other lightrefreshment as a lady may take after a swoon</s>  when he returned shebethought herself of mr</s>  arbuton who having once come back to see ifall was going well had vanished again</s> why our friend boston is bearing up under his share of the morningswork like a heroor a lady with a sprained ankle said the colonel ashe arranged the provision</s>  to see the havoc hes making in the ham

stars that had thrust him further and further atevery step into the intimacy of these people as he called them tohimself</s>  it was just twentyfour hours he reflected since he had metthem and resolved to have nothing to do with them and in that time theyoung lady had brought him under the necessity of apologizing for ablunder of her own he had played the eavesdropper to her talk he hadsentimentalized the midnight hour with her they had all taken a morningride together and he had ended by having mrs</s>  ellison sprain her ankleand faint in his arms</s>  it was outrageous and what made it worse wasthat decency obliged him to take henceforth a regretful deprecatoryattitude towards mrs</s>  ellison whom he liked least among these people</s> so he sat vindictively eating an enormous breakfast in a sort of angryabstraction from which kittys coming roused him to say that he hopedmrs</s>  ellison was better</s> o very much</s>  its just a sprain</s> a sprain may be a very

noted foranything in particular its not even on any railroad</s>  its in thenorthwest part of the state</s> isnt it in the oilregions</s>  groped mr</s>  arbuton</s> why the oilregions are rather migratory you know</s>  it used to be inthe oilregions but the oil was pumped out and then the oilregionsgracefully withdrew and left the cheeseregions and graperegions tocome back and take possession

field has its derrick standing just as the lastdollar or the last drop of oil left it</s> mr</s>  arbuton brought his fancy to bear upon eriecreek and wholly failedto conceive of it</s>  he did not like the notion of its being thrust withinthe range of his knowledge and he resented its being the home of missellison whom he was beginning to accept as a not quite comprehensibleyet certainly agreeable fact though he still had a disposition to casther off as something incredible</s>  he asked no further about eriecreekand presently she rose and went to join her relatives and he went tosmoke his cigar and to ponder upon the problem presented to him in thisyoung girl from whose locality and conjecturable experiences he was atloss how to infer her as he found her here</s> she had a certain selfreliance mingling with an innocent trust ofothers which mrs</s>  isabel march had described to her husband as a charmpotent to make everybody sympathetic and goodnatured but which itwould not be easy to account for to mr</s>  arbuton</s>  in part it was anatural gift and partly it came from mere ignorance of the world itwas the unsnubbed fearlessness of a heart which did not suspect a

in the fiercedemocracy of his revolt from his virginian traditions he had taught hisfamily that a belief in any save intellectual and moral distinctions wasa mean and cruel superstition he had contrived to fix this idea sodeeply in the education of his children that it gave a coloring totheir lives and kitty when her turn came had the effect of it in thecharacter of those about her</s>  in fact she accepted his extreme theoriesof equality to a degree that delighted her uncle who having held themmany years was growing perhaps a little languid in their tenure and wasglad to have his grasp strengthened by her faith</s>  socially as well aspolitically eriecreek was almost a perfect democracy and there waslittle in kittys circumstances to contradict the doctors teachings</s> the brief visits which she had made to buffalo and erie and since thecolonels marriage to milwaukee had not sufficed to undeceive her shehad never suffered slight save from the ignorant and uncouth

cultivated</s> in the secluded life which she led perforce at eriecreek there was anabundance of leisure which she bestowed upon books at an age when mostgirls are sent to school</s>  the doctor had a good taste of anoldfashioned kind in literature and he had a library pretty wellstocked with the elderly english authors poets and essayists andnovelists and here and there an historian and these

folly or pretentiousness ofkittys some trait of their own some absurdity of the boys if theyhappened to be at home and came lounging in were the themes out ofwhich they contrived such jollity as never

the thought of theministry and he had since travelled and read law and become a man ofsociety and of clubs but he still kept the traits that had seemed tomake his vocation clear</s>  on the other hand he kept the prejudices thatwere imagined to have disqualified him</s>  he was an exclusive by trainingand by instinct</s>  he gave ordinary humanity credit for a certain measureof sensibility and it is possible that if he had known more kinds ofmen he would have recognized merits and excellences which did not nowexist for him but i do not think he would have liked them</s>  his doubt ofthese western people was the most natural if not the most justifiablething in the world and for kitty if he could have known all about heri do not see how he could have believed in her at all</s>  as it was

journey that ive seen a great many things that iknow ive only read of before and so followed mr</s>  arbuton in his tourof the pictures</s> she was as ignorant of art as any roman or florentine girl whose lifehas been passed in the midst of it and she believed these mighty finepictures and was puzzled by mr</s>  arbutons behavior towards them whowas too little imaginative or too conscientious to

european gallery doubted thevandyck and cared nothing for the conception in the style of lebrun over the highaltar though it had the historical interest ofhaving survived that bombardment of 1759 which destroyed the church</s> kitty innocently singled out the worst picture in the place as herfavorite and then was piqued and presently frightened at his coldreluctance about it</s>  he made her feel that it was very bad and that sheshared its inferiority though he said nothing to that effect</s>  shelearned the shame of not being a connoisseur in a connoisseurs companyand she perceived more painfully than ever before that a bostonian whohad been much in europe might be very uncomfortable to the simpleunravelled american</s>  yet she reminded herself the marches had been ineurope and they were bostonians also and they did not go about puttingeverything under foot they seemed to care for everything they saw andto have a friendly jest if not praises for it</s>  she liked that shewould have been well enough pleased to have mr</s>  arbuton laugh outrightat her picture and she could have joined him in it</s>  but the lookhowever flattered into an air of polite question at last which he hadbent upon her seemed to outlaw her and condemn her taste in everything</s> as they passed out of the cathedral she would rather have gone homethan continued the walk as he begged her if she were

of mr</s>  marchbut dismissed the thought as unworthy and having perceived that herfriends were snubbed she said bravely that they were the mostdelightful people she had ever seen and she was sorry that they werenot still in quebec</s>  he shared her regret tacitly if at all and theywalked in silence to the gate whence they strolled down the windingstreet outside the wall into the lower town</s>  but it was not a pleasantramble for kitty she was in a dim dread of hitherto unseen andunimagined trespasses against good taste not only in pictures andpeople but in all life which from having been a very smiling prospectwhen she set out with mr</s>  arbuton had suddenly become a narrow pathwayin which one must pick ones way with more regard to each step than anygeneral end</s>  all this was as obscure and uncertain as the intimationswhich had produced it and which in words had really amounted tonothing</s>  but she felt more and more that in her companion there wassomething wholly alien to the influences which had shaped her andthough she could not know how much she was sure of enough to make herdreary in his presence</s> they wandered through the quaintness and noiseless bustle of the lowertown thoroughfares and came by and by to that old church the oldest inquebec which was built near two hundred years ago in fulfilment of avow made at the repulse of sir william phippss attack upon the cityand further famed for the prophecy of a nun that this church should beruined by the fire in which a successful attempt of the english was yetto involve the lower town</s>  a painting which represented the vision ofthe nun perished in the conflagration which verified it in 1759 butthe walls of the ancient structure remain to witness this singular pieceof history which kitty now glanced at furtively in one of the colonelsguidebooks since her illfortune with the picture in the cathedralshe had not openly cared for anything</s> at one side of the church there was a booth for the sale of crockery andtin ware and there was an everyday cheerfulness of small business inthe shops and tented stands about the square on which the church facedand through which there was continual passing of heavy burdens from theport swift calashes and slow countrypaced marketcarts</s> mr</s>  arbuton made no motion to enter the church and kitty would not hintthe curiosity she felt to see the

impulse</s>  on their way towards the highaltar theypassed the rude black bier with the tallow candles yet smoking in theirblack wooden candlesticks</s>  a few worshippers were dropped here and therein the vacant seats and at a principal sidealtar knelt a poor womanpraying before a wooden effigy of the dead christ that lay in a glasscase under the altar</s>  the image was of lifesize and was painted torepresent life or rather death with false hair and beard and with themuslin drapery managed to expose the stigmata it was stretched upon abed strewn with artificial flowers and it was

her person swayed from side to side inthe abandon of her prayer</s>  who could she be and what was her mightyneed of blessing or forgiveness</s>  as her wont was kitty threw her ownsoul into the imagined case of the suppliant the tragedy of her desireor sorrow</s>  yet like all who suffer sympathetically she was not withoutconsolations unknown to the principal and the waning afternoon as itlit up the conventional ugliness of the old church and theparaphernalia of its worship relieved her emotional selfabandon with aremote sense of content so that it may have been a jealousy for theintegrity of her own revery as well as a feeling for the poor womanthat made her tremble lest mr</s>  arbuton should in some way disparage thespectacle</s>  i suppose that her interest in it was more an aesthetic thana spiritual one it embodied to her sight many a scene of penitence thathad played before her fancy and i do not know but she would have beenwilling to have the suppliant guilty of some dreadful misdeed ratherthan eating meat last friday which was probably her sin</s>  however itwas the ancient crone before that ghastly idol was precious to her andit seemed too great a favor

mr</s>  arbutonsneutrality a light of ideal character</s>  he bestowed the alms craved ofhim in turn he did not repulse the beldames blessing and kitty whowas already moved by his kindness to that poor mourner at the doorforgot that the earlier part of their walk had been so miserable andclimbed back to the upper town through the prescott gate in greatergayety than she had yet known that day in his company</s>  i think he hadnot done much to make her cheerful but it is one of the advantages of atemperament like his that very little is expected of it and that itcan more easily than any other

street and they both admired the hugeshoulder of rock near the gate with its poplars atop and the batteryat the brink with the muzzles of the guns thrust forward against thesky</s>  she could not move him to her pleasure in the grotesqueness of thecircusbills plastered halfway up the rock but he tolerated the levitywith which she commented on them and her light sallies upon passingthings and he

 on this account she often has to send dick and me out together when she would like to keep him with her for she wont trust either of us alone and when we come back she examines us separately to see whether we have skipped anything</s>  this makes us faithful in the smallest things</s>  she says she is determined that uncle jack shall have a full and circumstantial report from me of all that he wants to know about the celebrated places here and i really think he will if i go on or am goaded on in this way</s>  its pure devotion to the cause in fanny for you know she doesnt care for such things herself and has no pleasure in it but carrying a point</s>  her chief consolation under her trial of keeping still is to see how i look in her different dresses</s>  she sighs over me as i appear in a new garment and says o if she only had the dressing of me</s>  then she gets up and limps and hops across the room to where i stand before the glass and puts a pin here and a ribbon there and gives my hair which she has dressed herself a little dab to make it lie differently and then scrambles back to her sofa and knocks her lame ankle against something and lies there groaning and enjoying herself like a martyr</s>  on days when she thinks she is never going to get well she says she doesnt know why she doesnt give me her things at once and be done with it and on days when she thinks she is going to get well right away she says she will have me one made something like whatever dress i have got on as soon as shes home</s>  then up shell jump again for the exact measure and tell me the history of every stitch and how shell have it altered just the least grain and differently trimmed to suit my complexion better and ends by having promised to get me something not in the least like it</s>  you have some idea already of what fanny is and all you have got to do is to multiply it by about fifty thousand</s>  her sprained ankle simply intensifies her whole character</s>  besides helping to compose fannys expeditionary corps and really exerting himself in the cause of uncle jack as he calls it dick is behaving beautifully</s>  every morning after breakfast he goes over to the hotel and looks at the arrivals and reads the newspapers and though we never get anything out of him afterwards we somehow feel informed of all that is going on</s>
 he has taken to smoking a clay pipe in honor of the canadian fashion and he wears a gay barbaric scarf of indian muslin wound round his hat and flying out behind because the quebeckers protect themselves in that way against sunstroke when the thermometer gets up among the sixties</s>  he has also bought a pair of snowshoes to be prepared for the other extreme of weather in case anything else should happen to fanny and detain us into the winter</s>  when he has rested from his walk to the hotel we usually go out together and explore as we do also in the afternoon and in the evening we walk on durham terracea promenade overlooking the river where the whole cramped and crooked city goes for exercise</s>  its a formal parade in the evening but one morning i went there before breakfast for a change and found it the resort of careless ease two or three idle boys were sunning themselves on the carriages of the big guns that stand on the terrace a little dog was barking at the chimneys of the lower town and an old gentleman was walking up and down in his dressinggown and slippers just as if it were his own front porch</s>  he looked something like uncle jack and i wished it had been heto see the smoke curling softly up from the lower town the bustle about the marketplace and the shipping in the river and the haze hanging over the water a little way off and the near hills all silver and the distant ones blue</s>  but if we are coming to the grand and the beautiful why there is no direction in which you can look about quebec without seeing it and it is always mixed up with something so familiar and homelike that my heart warms to it</s>  the jesuit barracks are just across the street from us in the foreground of the most magnificent landscape the building isthink you eriecreekers of an hour</s> two hundred years old and it looks five hundred</s>  the english took it away from the jesuits in 1760 and have used it as barracks ever since but it isnt in the least changed so that a jesuit missionary who visited it the other day said that it was as if his brother priests had been driven out of it the week before</s>  well you might think so old and so historical a place would be putting on airs but it takes as kindly to domestic life as a new framehouse and i am never tired of looking over into the yard at the frowsy soldiers wives hanging out clothes and the unkempt children playing among the burdocks and chickens and cats and the soldiers themselves carrying about the officers boots or sawing wood and picking up chips to boil the teakettle</s>  they are off dignity as well as off duty then but when they are on both and in full dress they make our volunteers as i remember them seem very shabby and slovenly</s>  over the belfry of the barracks our windows command a view of half quebec with its roofs and spires dropping down the slope to the lower town where the masts of the ships in the river come tapering up among them and then of the plain stretching from the river in the valley to a range of mountains against the horizon with faroff white villages glimmering out of their purple folds</s>  the whole plain is bright with houses and harvestfields and the distinctly divided farmsthe owners cut them up every generation and give each son a strip of the entire lengthrun back on either hand from the straight roads bordered by poplars while the highways near the city pass between lovely villas</s>  but this landscape and the jesuit barracks with all their merits are nothing to the ursuline convent just under our back windows which i told you something about in my other letter</s>
 she was very rich and very beautiful and a saint from the beginning so that when her husband died and her poor old father wanted her to marry again and not go into a nunnery she didnt mind cheating him by a sham marriage with a devout gentleman and she came to canada as soon as her father was dead with another saint marie de lincarnation and founded this convent</s>  the first building is standing yet as strong as ever though everything but the stone walls was burnt two centuries ago</s>  only a few years since an old ashtree under which the ursulines first taught the indian children blew down and now a large black cross marks its place</s>  the modern nuns are in the garden nearly the whole morning long and by night the ghosts of the former nuns haunt it and in very bright moonlight i myself do a bit of madame de la peltrie there and teach little indian boys who dwindle like those in the song as the moon goes down</s>  it is an enchanted place and i wish we had it in the back yard at eriecreek though i dont think the neighbors would approve of the architecture</s>  i have adopted two nuns for my own one is tall and slender and pallid and you can see at a glance that she broke the heart of a mortal lover and knew it when she became the bride of heaven and the other is short and plain and plump and looks as comfortable and commonplace as lifeafterdinner</s>  when the world is bright i revel in the statuelike sadness of the beautiful nun who never laughs or plays with the little girl pupils but when the world is darkas the best of worlds will be at times for a minute or twoi take to the fat nun and go in for a clumsy romp with the children and then i fancy that i am wiser if not better than the fair slim ursuline</s>  but whichever i am for the time being i am vexed with the other yet they always are together as if they were counterparts</s>  i think a nice story might be written about them</s>  in wolfes siege of quebec this ursuline garden of ours was everywhere torn up by the falling bombs and the sisters were driven out into the world they had forsaken forever as fanny has been reading in a little french account of the events written at the time by a nun of the general hospital</s>  it was there the ursulines took what refuge there was going from their cloistered schoolrooms and their innocent little ones to the wards of the hospital filled with the wounded and dying of either side and echoing with their dreadful groans</s>  what a sad evil bewildering world they had a glimpse of</s>  in the garden here our poor montcalmi belong to the french side please in quebecwas buried in a grave dug for him by a bursting shell</s>  they have his skull now in the chaplains room of the convent where we saw it the other day</s>  they have made it comfortable in a glass box neatly bound with black and covered with a white lace drapery just as if it were a saints</s>  it was broken a little in taking it out of the grave and a few years ago some english officers borrowed it to look at and were horrible enough to pull out some of the teeth</s>  tell uncle jack the head is very broad above the ears but the forehead is small</s>  the chaplain also showed us a copy of an old painting of the first convent indian lodges madame de la peltries house and madame herself very splendidly dressed with an indian chief before her and some french cavaliers riding down an avenue towards her</s>  then he showed us some of the nuns work in albums painted and lettered in a way to give me an idea of old missals</s>  by and by he went into the chapel with us and it gave such a queer notion of his indoors life to have him put on an overcoat and indiarubbers to go a few rods through the open air to the chapel door he had not been very well he said</s>  when he got in he took off his hat and put on an octagonal priests cap and showed us everything in the kindest wayand his manners were exquisite</s>  there were beautiful paintings sent out from france at the time of the revolution and woodcarvings round the highaltar done by quebec artists in the beginning of the last century for he said they had a school of arts then at st</s>  annes twenty miles below the city</s>  then there was an ivory crucifix so lifelike that you could scarcely bear to look at it</s>  but what i most cared for was the tiny twinkle of a votive lamp which he pointed out to us in one corner of the nuns chapel it was lit a hundred and fifty years ago by two of our french officers when their sister took the veil and has never been extinguished since except during the siege of 1759</s>  of course i think a story might be written about this and the truth is the possibilities of fiction in quebec are overpowering i go about in a perfect haze of romances and meet people at every turn who have nothing to do but invite the passing novelist into their houses and have their likenesses done at once for heroes and heroines</s>  they neednt change a thing about them but sit just as they are and if this is in the present only think how the whole past of quebec must be crying out to be put into historical romances</s>  i wish you could see the houses and how substantial they are</s>  i can only think of eriecreek as an assemblage of huts and barklodges in contrast</s>  our boardinghouse is comparatively slight and has stone walls only a foot and a half thick but the average is two feet and two and a half and the other day dick went through the laval universityhe goes everywhere and gets acquainted with everybodyand saw the foundation walls of the first building which have stood all the sieges and conflagrations since the seventeenth century and no wonder for they are six feet thick and form a series of lowvaulted corridors as heavy he says as the casemates of a fortress</s>  there is a beautiful old carved staircase there of the same date and he liked the president a priest ever so much and we like the looks of all the priests we see they are so handsome and polite and they all speak english with some funny little defect</s>  the other day we asked such a nice young priest about the way to hare point where it is said the recollet friars had their first mission on the marshy meadows he didnt know of this bit of history and we showed him our book</s>  ah</s>  you see the book say probably the site</s>  if it had said certainly i should have known</s>  but probably probably you see</s>  however he showed us the way and down we went through the lower town and out past the general hospital to this pointe aux livres which is famous also because somewhere near it on the st</s>  charles jacques cartier wintered in 1536 and kidnapped the indian king donnacona whom he carried to france</s>  and it was here montcalms forces tried to rally after their defeat by wolfe</s>  please read this several times to uncle jack so that he can have it impressed upon him how faithful i am in my historical researches</s>  it makes me dreadfully angry and sad to think the french should have been robbed of quebec after what they did to build it</s>  but it is still quite a french city in everything even to sympathy with france in this prussian war which you would hardly think they would care about</s>  our landlady says the very boys in the street know about the battles and explain every time the french are beaten how they were outnumbered and betrayedsomething the way we used to do in the first of our war</s>  i suppose you will think i am crazy but i do wish uncle jack would wind up his practice at eriecreek and sell the house and come to live at quebec</s>  i have been asking prices of things and i find that everything is very cheap even according to the eriecreek standard we could get a beautiful house on the st</s>  louis road for two hundred a year beef is ten or twelve cents a pound and everything else in proportion</s>  then besides that the washing is sent out into the country to be done by the peasantwomen and there isnt a crumb of bread baked in the house but it all comes from the bakers and only think girls what a relief that would be</s>  do get uncle jack to consider it seriously</s>  since i began this letter the afternoon has worn awaythe light from the sunset on the mountains would glorify our suppertable without extra charge if we lived hereand the twilight has passed and the moon has come up over the gables and dormerwindows of the convent and looks into the garden so invitingly that i cant help joining her</s>  so i will put my writing by till tomorrow</s>  the goingtobed bell has rung and the red lights have vanished one by one from the windows and the nuns are asleep and another set of ghosts is playing in the garden with the coppercolored phantoms of the indian children of long ago</s>
 what</s>  not madame de la peltrie</s>
 oh</s>  how do they like those little fibs of yours up in heaven</s>  sunday afternoon</s> as we were at the french cathedral last sunday we went to the english today and i could easily have imagined myself in some church of old england hearing the royal family prayed for and listening to the pretty poor sermon delivered with such an english brogue</s>  the people too had such englishy faces and such queer little eccentricities of dress the young lady that sang contralto in the choir wore a scarf like a mans on her hat</s>  the cathedral isnt much architecturally i suppose but it affected me very solemnly and i couldnt help feeling that it was as much a part of british power and grandeur as the citadel itself</s>  over the bishops seat drooped the flag of a crimean regiment tattered by time and battles which was hung up here with great ceremonies in 1860 when the prince of wales presented them with new colors and up in the gallery was a kind of glorified pew for royal highnesses and governorgenerals and so forth to sit in when they are here</s>  there are tablets and monumental busts about the walls and one to the memory of the duke of lenox the governorgeneral who died in the middle of the last century from the bite of a fox which seemed an odd fate for a duke and somehow made me very sorry for him</s>  fanny of course couldnt go to church with me and dick got out of it by lingering too late over the newspapers at the hotel and so i trudged off with our bostonian who is still with us here</s>  i didnt dwell much upon him in my last letter and i dont believe now i can make him quite clear to you</s>  he has been a good deal abroad and he is europeanized enough not to think much of america though i cant find that he quite approves of europe and his experience seems not to have left him any particular country in either hemisphere</s>  he isnt the bostonian of uncle jacks imagination and i suspect he wouldnt like to be</s>  he is rather too young still to have much of an antislavery record and even if he had lived soon enough i think that he would not have been a john brown man</s>  i am afraid that he believes in vulgar and meretricious distinctions of all sorts and that he hasnt an atom of magnanimous democracy in him</s>  in fact i find to my great astonishment that some ideas which i thought were held only in england and which i had never seriously thought of seem actually a part of mr</s>  arbutons nature or education</s>  he talks about the lower classes and tradesmen and the best people and good families as i supposed nobody in this country ever didin earnest</s>  to be sure i have always been reading of characters who had such opinions but i thought they were just put into novels to eke out somebodys unhappinessto keep the highborn daughter from marrying beneath her for love and so on or else to be made fun of in the person of some silly old woman or some odious snob and i could hardly believe at first that our bostonian was serious in talking in that way</s>  such things sound so differently in real life and i laughed at them till i found that he didnt know what to make of my laughing and then i took leave to differ with him in some of his notions but he never disputes anything i say and so makes it seem rude to differ with him</s>  i always feel though he begins it as if i had thrust my opinions upon him</s>  but in spite of his weaknesses and disagreeabilities there is something really high about him he is so scrupulously true so exactly just that uncle jack himself couldnt be more so though you can see that he respects his virtues as the peculiar result of some extraordinary system</s>  here at quebec though he goes round patronizing the landscape and the antiquities and coldly smiling at my little enthusiasms there is really a great deal that ought to be at least improving in him</s>  i get to paying him the same respect that he pays himself and imbues his very clothes with till everything he has on appears to look like him and respect itself accordingly</s>  i have often wondered what his hat his honored hat for instance would do if i should throw it out of the front window</s>  it would make an earthquake i believe</s>  he is politely curious about us and from time to time in a shrinking disgusted way he asks some leading question about eriecreek which he doesnt seem able to form any idea of as much as i explain it</s>  he clings to his original notion that it is in the heart of the oil regions of which he has seen pictures in the illustrated papers and when i assert myself against his opinions he treats me very gingerly as if i were an explosive sprite or an inflammable naiad from a torpedoed well and it wouldnt be quite safe to oppose me or i would disappear with a flash and a bang</s>  when dick isnt able to go with me on fannys account mr</s>  arbuton takes his place in the expeditionary corps and we have visited a good many points of interest together and now and then he talks very entertainingly about his travels</s>  but i dont think they have made him very cosmopolitan</s>  it seems as if he went about with a little imaginary standard and was chiefly interested in things to see whether they fitted it or not</s>  trifling matters annoy him and when he finds sublimity mixed up with absurdity it almost makes him angry</s>  one of the oddest and oldestlooking buildings in quebec is a little onestory house on st</s>  louis street to which poor general montgomery was taken after he was shot and it is a pastrycooks now and the tarts and cakes in the window vexed mr</s>  arbuton so muchnot that he seemed to care for montgomerythat i didnt dare to laugh</s>  i live very little in the nineteenth century at present and do not care much for people who do</s>  still i have a few grains of affection left for uncle jack which i want you to give him</s>  i suppose it will take about six stamps to pay this letter</s>  i forgot to say that dick goes to be barbered every day at the montcalm shaving and shampooing saloon so called because they say montcalm held his last council of war there</s>  it is a queer little steeproofed house with a flowering bean up the front and a bit of garden full of snapdragons before it</s>  we shall be here a week or so yet at any rate and then i think we shall go straight home dick has lost so much time already</s>  with a great deal of love your kitty</s> vii</s> loves young dream</s> with the two young people whose days now lapsed away together it couldnot be said that monday varied much from tuesday or ten oclock fromhalf past three they were not always certain what day of the week itwas and sometimes they fancied that a thing which happened in themorning had taken place yesterday afternoon</s> but whatever it was and however uncertain in time and character theirslight adventure was to themselves mrs</s>  ellison secured all possibleknowledge of it from kitty</s>  since it was her misfortune that promotedit she considered herself a martyr to kittys acquaintance with mr</s> arbuton and believed that she had the best claim to any gossip thatcould come of it</s>  she lounged upon her sofa and listened with apatience superior to the maiden caprice with which her inquisition wassometimes met for if that delayed her satisfaction it also employed herarts and the final triumph of getting everything out of kitty affordedher a delicate selfflattery</s>  but commonly the young girl was readyenough to speak for she was glad to have the light of a worldlier mindand a greater experience than her own on mr</s>  arbutons character ifmrs</s>  ellison was not the wisest head still talking him over was atleast a relief from thinking him over and then at the end of the endswhen were ever two women averse to talk of a man</s> she commonly sought fannys sofa when she returned from her ramblesthrough the city and gave a sufficiently strict account of what hadhappened</s>  this was done lightheartedly and with touches of burlesqueand extravagance at first but the reports grew presently to have a moreserious tone and latterly kitty had been so absent at times that shewould fall into a puzzled silence in the midst of her narration or elseshe would meet a long procession of skilfully marshalled questions witha flippancy that no one but a martyr could have suffered</s>  but mrs</s> ellison bore all and would have borne much more in that cause</s>  battledat one point she turned to another and the sum of her researches wasoften a clearer perception of kittys state of

understand you kitty</s> why youve seen how it is with us at home and how uncle jack hasbrought us up</s>  we never had a rule for anything except to do what wasright and to be careful of the rights

talking about people and discussing thembut we always talk of each person for what he is in himself and ialways thought a person could refine himself if he tried and wassincere and not conceited</s>

i cling the closer to my idols i cant help now and thentrying myself by his criterions and then i find myself wanting in everycivilized trait and my whole life coarse and poor and all myassociations hopelessly degraded</s>  i think his ideas are hard and narrowand i believe that even my little experience would prove them false butthen they are his and i cant reconcile them with what i see is

you this afternoon</s> o we went to the htel dieu for one thing and afterwards we lookedinto the courtyard of the convent and there another of his pleasantlittle traits came outa way he has of always putting you in the wrongeven when its a matter of no consequence any way and there neednt beany right or wrong about it</s>  i remembered the place because mrs</s>  marchyou know showed us a rose that one of the nuns in the hospital gaveher and i tried to tell mr</s>  arbuton about it and he graciously took itas if poor mrs</s>  march had made an advance towards his acquaintance</s>  i dowish you could see what a lovely place that courtyard is fanny</s>  itsso strange that such a thing should be right there in the heart of thiscrowded city but there it was with its peasant cottage on one sideand its long low barns on the other and those widehorned canadiancows munching at the racks of hay outside and pigeons and chickens allabout among their feetyes yes never mind all that kitty</s>  you know i hate nature</s>  go onabout mr</s>  arbuton said mrs</s>  ellison who did not mean a sarcasm</s> it looked like a farmyard in a picture far out in the countrysomewhere resumed kitty and mr</s>  arbuton did it the honor to say itwas just like normandy</s> kitty</s> he did indeed fanny and the cows didnt go down on their knees outof gratitude either</s>  well off on the right were the hospital buildingsclimbing up you know with their stone walls and steep roofs andwindows dropped about over them like our convent here and there was anartist there sketching it all he had such a brown pleasant face witha little black mustache and imperial and such gay black eyes thatnobody could help falling in love with him and he was talking in such afreeandeasy way with the lazy workmen and women overlooking him</s>  hejotted down a little image of the virgin in a niche on the wall and oneof the people called outmr</s>  arbuton was translatinglook there</s> with one touch hes made our blessed lady</s>  o says the painterthats nothing with three touches i can make the entire holy family</s> and they all laughed and that little joke you know won my heartidont hear many jokes from mr</s>  arbutonand so i said what a blessedlife a painters must be for it would give you a right to be a vagrantand you could wander through the world seeing everything that waslovely and funny and nobody could blame you and i wondered everybodywho had the chance didnt learn to sketch</s>  mr</s>  arbuton took itseriously and said people had to have something more than the chance tolearn before they could sketch and that most of them were an afflictionwith their sketchbooks and he had seen too much of the sad effects ofdrawing from casts</s>  and he put me in the wrong as he always does</s>  dontyou see</s>  i didnt want to learn drawing i wanted to be a painter andgo about sketching beautiful old convents and sit on campstools onpleasant afternoons and joke with people</s>  of course he couldntunderstand that</s>  but i know the artist could</s>  o fanny if it had onlybeen the painter whose arm i took that first day on the boat instead ofmr</s>  arbuton</s>  but the worst of it is he is making a hypocrite of me anda cowardly unnatural girl</s>  i wanted to go nearer and look at thepainters sketch but i was ashamed to say id never seen a realartists sketch before and im getting to be ashamed or to seemashamed of a great many innocent things</s>  he has a way of not seeming tothink it possible that any one he associates with can differ from him</s> and i do differ from him</s>  i differ from him as much as my whole pastlife differs from his i know im just the kind of production that hedisapproves of and that im altogether irregular and unauthorized andunjustifiable and though its funny to have him talking to me as if imust have the sympathy of a rich girl with his ideas its provokingtoo and its very bad for me</s>  up to the present moment fanny if youwant to know thats the principal effect of mr</s>  arbuton on me</s>  imbeing gradually snubbed and scared into treasons stratagems andspoils</s> mrs</s>  ellison did not find all this so very grievous for she was one ofthose women who like a snub from the superior sex if it does notinvolve a slight to their beauty or their power of pleasing</s>  but shethought it best not to enter into the question and merely said butsurely kitty there are a great many things in mr</s>  arbuton that youmust respect</s> respect</s>  o yes indeed</s>  but respect isnt just the thing for one whoseems to consider himself

enough</s> what do you mean</s> nothing</s>  only sometimes it seems to me as if he hadnt read because heloved it but because he thought it due to himself</s>  but maybe immistaken</s>  i could imagine a delicate poem shutting up half its sweetnessfrom his cold cold scrutinyif you will excuse the floweriness of theidea</s> why kitty</s>  dont you think hes refined</s>  im sure i think hes

healways agreeable</s> i thought we were discussing his mind fanny</s>  i dont know that i feellike enlarging upon his manners said kitty slyly</s> but surely kitty said the matron with an air of

having come out ofhim</s>  hes very well trained and nine times out of ten hes soexquisitely polite that its wonderful but the tenth time he may saysomething so rude that you cant believe it</s> then you like him nine times out of ten</s> i didnt say that</s>  but for the tenth time its certain his trainingdoesnt hold out and he seems to have nothing natural to fall backupon</s>  but you can believe that if he knew hed been disagreeable hedbe sorry for it</s> why then kitty how can you say that theres no connection betweenhis heart and manners</s>  this very thing proves that they come from hisheart</s>  dont be illogical kitty said mrs</s>  ellison and her nervesadded sotto voce if you are so abominably provoking</s> o responded the young girl with the kind of laugh that meant it wasafter all not such a laughing matter i didnt say hed be sorry foryou</s>  perhaps he would but hed be certain to be sorry for himself</s> its with his politeness as it is with his reading he seems to considerit something thats due to himself as a gentleman to treat people welland it isnt in the least as if he cared for them</s>  he wouldnt like tofail in such a point</s> but kitty isnt that to his credit</s> maybe</s>  i dont say</s>  if i knew more about the world perhaps i shouldadmire it</s>  but now you seeand here kittys laugh grew more naturaland she gave a subtle caricature of mr</s>  arbutons air and tone as shespokei cant help feeling that its a littlevulgar</s> mrs</s>  ellison could not quite make out how much kitty really meant ofwhat she had said</s>  she gasped once or twice for argument then she satup and beat the sofapillows vengefully in composing herself anew andfinally well kitty im sure i dont know what to make of it allshe said with a sigh</s> why were not obliged to make anything of it fanny theres thatcomfort replied kitty and then there was a silence while she broodedover the whole affair of her acquaintance with mr</s>  arbuton which thistalk had failed to set in a more pleasant or hopeful light</s>  it had begunlike a romance she had pleased her fancy if not her heart with thepoetry of it but at last she felt exiled and strange in his presence</s> she had no right to a different result even through any deep feeling inthe matter but while she owned with her halfsad halfcomicalconsciousness that she had been tacitly claiming and expecting toomuch she softly pitied herself with a kind of impersonal compassionas if it wore some other girl whose pretty dream had been broken</s>  itsruin involved the loss of another ideal for she was aware that therehad been gradually rising in her mind an image of boston differentalike from the holy place of her childhood the sacred city of theantislavery heroes and martyrs and from the jesting easy sympatheticboston of mr</s>  and mrs</s>  march</s>  this new boston with which mr</s>  arbutoninspired her was a boston of mysterious prejudices and loftyreservations a boston of high

thinking what a verydifferent boston her uncle jacks was from mr</s>  arbutons andmaliciously diverted with what she conceived of their mutualbewilderment in trying to get some common standpoint</s>  he had risen fromhis chair and was now standing a few paces from her looking toward thefall as if by looking he might delay the coming of the colonel andfanny</s> she checked her merriment a moment to

survey the company</s>  but at sight of mr</s>  arbuton one ofthem advanced directly toward him with exclamations of surprise andpleasure and he with a stupefied face and a mechanical movement turnedto meet her</s> she was a lady of more than middle age dressed with certain personalaudacities of color and shape rather than overdressed and she thrustforward in expression of her amazement a very small hand wonderfullywell gloved her manner was full of the anxiety of a woman who hadfought hard for a high place in society and yet suggested a latenthatred of people who in yielding to her had made success bitter andhumiliating</s> her companion was a young and very handsome girl exquisitely dressedand just so far within the fashion as to show her already a mistress ofstyle</s>  but it was not the vivid new york stylishness</s>  a peculiarrestraint of line an effect of ladylike concession to the ruling modea temperance of ornament marked the whole array and stamped it withthe unmistakable character of boston</s>  her clear tints of lip and cheekand eye were incomparable her blond hair gave weight to the poise ofher delicate head by its rich and decent masses</s>  she had a look ofindependent innocence an angelic expression of extremely nice youngfellow blending with a subtle maidenly charm</s>  she indicated her surpriseat seeing mr</s>  arbuton by pressing the point of her sunumbrella somewhatnervously upon the floor and blushing a very little</s>  then she gave himher hand with friendly frankness and smiled dazzlingly upon him whilethe elder hailed him with effusive assertion of familiar acquaintanceheaping him with greetings and flatteries and cries of pleasure</s> o dear</s>  sighed kitty these are old friends of his and will i haveto know them</s>  perhaps its best to begin at once though she thought</s> but he made no movement toward her where she sat</s>  the ladies began towalk up and down and he with them</s>  as they passed her he did not seemto see her</s> the ladies said they were waiting for their carriage which they hadleft at a certain point when they went to look at the fall and hadordered to take them up at the inn</s>  they talked about people and thingsthat kitty had never heard of</s> have you seen the trailings since you left newport</s>  asked the elderwoman</s> no said mr</s>  arbuton</s> perhaps youll be surprised

mr</s>  arbuton at her side as she came up to the inn bent uponthe young girls face a stare of insolent curiosity yet with a front ofsuch impassive coldness that to another she might not have seemed awareof her presence</s>  kitty shuddered at the thought of being made acquaintedwith her then she remembered why how stupid i am</s>  of course agentleman cant introduce ladies and the only thing for him to do is toexcuse himself to them as soon as he can without rudeness and come backto me</s>  but none the less she felt helpless and deserted</s>  thoughordinarily so brave she was so beaten down by that look that for aglance of not unkindly interest that the young lady gave her she wasabjectly grateful</s>  she admired her and fancied that she could easily befriends with such a girl as that

their association</s> still the three walked up and down before kitty and still she made hispeace with herself thinking he is embarrassed he cant come to me atonce but he will of course</s> the elder of his companions talked on in her loud voice of this thingand that of her summer and of the people she had met and of theirplaces and yachts and horses and all the splendors of theirkeepingtalk which kittys aching sense sometimes caught by fragmentsand sometimes in full</s>  the lady used a slang of deprecation and apologyfor having come to such a queer resort as quebec and raised her browswhen mr</s>  arbuton reluctantly owned how long he had been there</s> ah ah</s>  she said briskly bringing the group to a standstill whileshe spoke one doesnt stay in a slow canadian city a whole month

hadagain refused fannys dresses that morning and had faithfully put onher own travellingsuitthe suit which rachel had made her and whichhad seemed so very well at eriecreek that they had called uncle

arbutons glanceim nothing but an awkward milkmaid beside that young lady</s>  this wasunjust to herself but truly it was never in her present figure that hehad intended to show her to his world which he had been sincere enoughin contemning for her sake while away from it</s>  confronted with goodsociety in these ladies its delegates he doubtless felt as neverbefore the vastness of his selfsacrifice the difficulty of hisenterprise and it would not have been so strange if just then sheshould have appeared to him through the hard cold vision of the bestpeople instead of that which love had illumined</s>  she saw whateverpurpose toward herself was in his eyes flicker and die out as they fellfrom hers</s>  then she sat alone while they three walked up and down upand down and the skirts of the ladies brushed her garments in passing</s> o where can dick and fanny be</s>  she silently bemoaned herself andwhy dont they come and save me from these dreadful people</s> she sat in a stony quiet while they talked on she thought forever</s> their voices sounded in her ears like voices heard in a dream theirlaughter had a nightmare cruelty</s>  yet she was resolved to be just to mr</s> arbuton she was determined not meanly to condemn him she confessed toherself with a glimmer of her wonted humor that her dress must be anordeal of peculiar anguish to him and she half blamed herself for herconscientiousness in wearing it</s>  if she had conceived of any such chanceas this she would perhaps she thought have worn fannys grenadine</s> she glanced again at the group which was

suppose he didnt understand and expects totake us up at the bridge</s>  provoking</s>  but its no use we may as well goto him at once its plain he isnt coming to us</s>  mr</s>  arbuton will yousee us on board</s> whoi</s>  yes certainly he answered absently and for the second timehe cast a furtive look at kitty who had half started to her feet inexpectation of his coming to her before he wenta look of appeal ordeprecation or reassurance as she chose to interpret it but after alla look only</s> she sank back in blank rejection of his look and so remained motionlessas he led the way from the porch with a quick and anxious step</s>  sincethose people came he had not openly recognized her presence and now hehad left her without a word</s>  she could not believe what she could notbut divine and she was powerless to stir as the three moved down theroad towards the carriage</s>  then she felt the tears spring to her eyesshe flung down her veil and swept on by a storm of grief and pride

 arbuton who had missed her onhis return to the inn coming with a frightened face to look for her</s> she had hoped somehow never to see him again in the world but since itwas to be she stood still and waited his approach in a strangecomposure while he drew nearer thinking how yesterday he had silencedher prophetic doubt of him i have one answer to all this i love you</s> her faltering words verified so fatally soon recalled themselves tohim with intolerable accusation</s>  and what should he say now</s>  ifpossiblyif by some miracleshe might not have seen what he fearedshe must</s>  one glance that he dared give her taught him better and whileshe waited for him to speak he could not lure any of the phrases ofwhich the air seemed full to serve him</s> i wonder you came back to me she said after an eternal moment</s> came back</s>  he echoed vacantly</s> you seemed to have forgotten my existence</s> of course the whole wrong if any wrong had been done to her was tacitand much might be said to prove that she felt needlessly aggrieved andthat he could not have acted otherwise than as he did she herself hadowned that it must be an embarrassing position to him</s> why what have i done he began what makes you think</s> </s> </s>  for heavenssake listen to me</s>  he cried and then while she turned a muteattentive face to him he stood silent as before like one who has losthis

did not expect them to stay</s>  ithought they would go away every moment and then at last it was toolate to manage the affair without seeming to force it</s>  this was betterand he paused again for some sign of acquiescence from kitty andcaught her eye fixed on his face in what seemed contemptuous wonder</s>  hisown eyes fell and ran uneasily over her dress before he lifted them andbegan once

cried desperately isthere nothing you have to say to me</s> no said kitty simply but with a languid quiet and shrinking fromspeech as from an added pang</s>  you have been telling me that you

it</s> deny what</s>  ibut here the whole fabric of mr</s>  arbutons defence toppled to theground</s>  he was a man of scrupulous truth not accustomed to deceivehimself or others</s>  he had been ashamed of her he could not deny it notto keep the love that was now dearer to him than life</s>  he saw it withparalyzing clearness and as an inexorable fact that confounded quiteas much as it

seemedto have been only the helpless sport of a sinister chance</s> but now he must act it could not go so it was too horrible a thing tolet stand confessed</s>  a hundred protests thronged to his

but you neednt think i didnt feel it</s>  i seemed to be like twopersons sitting there one in agony and one just coolly watching it</s> but o she broke out again while fanny held her closer in her

her cousin and they hada little cry together over the trust so done to death and kitty driedher eyes and bade fanny a brave goodnight and went off to weep againupon her pillow</s> but before that she called fanny to her door and with a smile breakingthrough the trouble of her face she asked how do you suppose he gotback</s>  i never thought of it before</s> oh</s>  cried mrs</s>  ellison with profound disgust i hope he had towalk back</s>  but im afraid there were only too many chances for him toride</s>  i dare say he could get a calash at the hotel there</s> kitty had not spoken a word of reproach to fanny for her part inpromoting this hapless affair and when the latter returning to her ownroom found the colonel there she told him the story and then began todiscern that she was not without credit for kittys fortunate escape asshe called it</s> yes said the colonel under exactly similar circumstances shellknow just what to expect another time if thats any comfort</s> its a great comfort retorted mrs</s>  ellison you cant find outwhat the world is too soon i can tell you and if i hadnt maneuvereda little to bring them together kitty might have gone off with somelingering fancy

whatcould i do under any circumstances</s> well dick of course youre right and i wish i could see things asclearly as you do</s>  but i really believe kittys glad to be out of it</s> what</s>  thundered the colonel</s> i think kittys secretly relieved to have it all over</s>  but you needntstun me</s> you do</s>  the colonel paused as if to gain force enough for a reply</s> but after
