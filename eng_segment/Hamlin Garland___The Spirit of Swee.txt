whole world had changed for him</s>  it was nolonger a question of ore and amalgams it was a question of when heshould see again that sad slender woman with the hopeless smile</s> he had now a great fear that she would not be able to come down tobreakfast at all but as her coming was his only hope of seeing her heclung to it</s>  eight oclock seemed to him to be the latest hour thatany one not absolutely bedridden would think of breakfasting and atfour minutes past the hour he entered the diningroom</s> the negro waiter tried to seat him near the door but he pushed ondown the hall toward a little group near one of the sunny windowswhich he took to be the sick girl and her father and so it proved</s> his seat at a table next to theirs brought her profile between himand the window and the light around her head seemed to glorify hertill she shone like a figure in a church window</s>  she seemed notconcerned with earth</s>  he was more deeply moved than ever before in hislife but he concealed itthe only sign of emotion was in the tremorof his hands</s> he studied the sick girl as closely as he could without seeming tostare</s>  she was even more lovely than he had thought</s>  his eyesaccustomed only to rough women found in her beauty that which wasflowerlike seraphic</s> her face was very thin and her neck too slender to uphold the heavymasses of her brown hair</s>  her

 he blew his nose and coughed and looked awayafter the manner of men and suffered in silence</s> once she turned and looked at clement and her eyes had a mysticalimpersonal look as though she saw him afar off not as an individualbut as a type of some admirable elemental creature</s>  he could notfathom her attitude toward him but he thought he saw in her everyaction the expression of a soul that had relinquished its hold onthings of the earth</s>  her desire to live was no longer personal</s>  shedid all that she did for her father and her friends wholly to pleasethem</s> the desire to aid her came upon clement againso powerful it carriedwith it an unwavering belief that he could help her</s> what was his newlyacquired wealth good for if he could not aid her</s> wealth</s>  yeshis blood</s>  he looked at his great brown hand and at hisbig veins full of blood</s>  why should she die when he had so much life</s> meanwhile his common sense had not entirely fled him</s>  he perceivedthat they were not poor and he reflected that they had probably triedall climates and all the resources of medical science also that thefather had quite as much red blood in his veins as any other man andthese considerations gave him thought as he watched them rise and goout upon the little veranda</s> clement was not a markedly humble person under ordinary conditions</s> he had a fashion of pushing rather heedlessly straight to hispurposewhich now was to speak to her to meet her face to face totouch her hand and to offer his aid</s>
