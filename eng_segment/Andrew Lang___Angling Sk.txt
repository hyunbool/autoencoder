the confessions of a dufferthese papers do not boast of great sport</s>  they are truthful not likethe tales some fishers tell</s>  they should appeal to many sympathies</s> there is no false modesty

jerk at it till somethingbreaks</s>  as for carelessness in boyhood i fished by preference withdoubtful gut and knots illtied it made the risk greater and increasedthe excitement if one did hook a trout</s>  i cant keep a flybook</s>  istuff the flies into my pockets at random or stick them into the leavesof a novel or bestow them in the lining of my hat or the case of myrods</s>  never till 1890 in all my days did i possess a landingnet</s>  ifi can drag a fish up a bank or over the gravel well if not he goes onhis way rejoicing</s>  on the test i thought it seemly to carry a

the love of fishing perhaps it is an inherited instinctwithout the inherited power</s>  i may have had a fishing ancestor whobequeathed to me the passion without the art</s>  my vocation is fixed andi have fished to little purpose all my days</s>  not for salmon an almostfabulous and yet a stupid fish which must be moved with a rod like aweavers beam</s>  the trout is more delicate and daintynot

year</s>  of course in a sutherlandloch one man is as good as another the expert no better than the duffer</s> the fish will take or they wont</s>  if they wont nobody can catch themif they will nobody can miss them</s>  it is as simple as trolling a minnowfrom a boat in loch leven probably the lowest possible form of angling</s> my ambition is as great as my skill is feeble to capture big trout withthe dry fly in the test that would content me and nothing under that</s> but i cant see the natural fly on the water i cannot see my own fly let it sink or let it swim</s> i often dont see the trout rise to me if he is such a fool as to riseand i cant strike in time when i do see him</s>  besides i am unteachableto tie any of the orthodox knots in the gut it takes me half an hour toget the gut through one of these newfangled iron eyes and when it isthrough i knot it any way</s>
that perhaps is why the hooks crack off so merrily</s>  then if i do spota rising trout and if he does not spot me as i crawl like the serpenttowards him my fly always fixes in a nettle a haycock a rosebush orwhatnot behind me</s>  i undo it or break it and put up another make acast and plop all the line falls in with a splash that wouldfrighten a crocodile</s>  the fishs big black fin goes cutting the streamabove and there is a sauve qui peut of trout in all directions</s> i once did manage to make a cast correctly the fly went over the fishsnose he rose i hooked him and he was a great silly brute of agrayling</s>  the grayling is the deadesthearted and the foolishestheadedfish that swims</s>  i would as lief catch a perch or an eel as a grayling</s> this is the worst of itthis ambition of the duffers this desire forperfection as if the golfing imbecile should match himself against mr</s> horace hutchinson or as the sow of the greek proverb challenged atheneto sing</s>  i know it all i deplore it i regret the evils of ambitionbut cest plus fort que moi</s>  if there is a trout rising well under thependant boughs that trail in the water if there is a brake of briarsbehind me a strong wind down stream for that trout in that impregnablesituation i am impelled to fish</s>  if i raise him i strike miss himcatch up in his tree swish the cast off into the briars break my topbreak my heart butthat is the humour of it</s>  the passion or instinctbeing in all senses blind must no doubt be hereditary</s>  it is full ofsorrow and bitterness and hope deferred and entails the mockery offriends especially of the fair</s>  but i would as soon lay down a love ofbooks as a love of fishing</s> success with pen or rod may be beyond one but there is the pleasure ofthe pursuit the rapture of endeavour the delight of an impossiblechase the joys of naturesky trees brooks and birds</s>  happiness inthese things is the legacy to us of the barbarian</s>  man in the futurewill enjoy bricks asphalte fog machinery society even picturegalleries as many men and most women do already</s>
 still they are meadows andstreams not wholly dispeopled yet of birds and trout nor can any defectof art nor certainty of laborious disappointment keep us from thewaterside when april comes</s> next

yet even they are kept alive like the incompetentangler by this undying hope they will be more careful more skilfulmore lucky next time</s>  the gleaming untravelled future the brightuntried waters allure us from day to day from pool to pool till likethe veteran on coquet side we try a farewell throw or like stoddartlook our last on tweed</s> a border boyhooda fisher says our father izaak is like a poet he must be born so</s> the majority of dwellers on the border are born to be fishers thanks tothe endless number of rivers and burns in the region between the tweedand the coqueta realm where almost all troutfishing is open andwhere since population and love of the sport have increased there isnow but little water that merits the trouble of putting up a rod</s> like the rest of us in that country i was born an angler though underan evil star for indeed my labours have not been blessed and aredevoted to fishing rather than to the catching of fish</s>  remembrance canscarcely recover nor time bring back to time the days when i was notbusy at the waterside yet the feat is not quite beyond the power ofmnemosyne</s>  my first recollection of the sport must date from about theage of four</s>  i recall in a dim brightness driving along a road thatran between banks of bracken and micaveined rocks and the sunlight on ashining bend of a highland stream and my father standing in the shallowwater showing me a huge yellow fish that gave its last fling or two onthe grassy bank</s>  the fish seemed as terrible and dangerous to me as totobit in the apocrypha did that ferocious halfpounder which he carrieson a string in the early italian pictures</s>  how oddly botticelli and hisbrethren misconceived the mandevouring fish which must have been acrocodile strayed from the nile into the waters of the euphrates</s>  a halfpounder</s>  to have been terrified by a trout seems a bad beginning andthereafter the mist gathers over the past only to lift again when isee myself with a crowd of other little children sent to fish withcrooked pins for minnows or baggies as we called them in theettrick</s>  if our parents hoped that we would bring home minnows for baitthey were disappointed</s>  the party was under the command of a nurserygoverness and probably she was no descendant of the mother of us alldame juliana berners</s>  we did not catch any minnows and i remembersitting to watch a bigger boy who was angling in a shoal of them when aparr came into the shoal and we had bright visions of alluring thatmonarch of the deep</s>  but the parr disdained our baits and for months idreamed of what it would have been to capture him and often thought ofhim in church</s>  in a moment of profane confidence my younger brother onceasked me what do you do in sermon time</s>  i said he in awhispermind you dont telli tell stories to myself about catchingtrout</s>  to which i added similar confession for even so i drove thesermon by and i have not toldtill now</s> by this time we must have been introduced to trout</s>  who forgets hisfirst trout</s>  mine thanks to that unlucky star was a double deceptionor rather there were two kinds of deception</s>  a village carpenter verykindly made rods for us</s>  they were of unpainted wood these first rodsthey were in two pieces with a real brass joint and there was a ring atthe end of the top joint to which the line was knotted</s>  we were stillin the age of walton who clearly knew nothing except by hearsay of areel he abandons the attempt to describe that machine as used by thesalmonfishers</s>  he thinks it must be seen to be understood</s>  with theseinnocent weapons and with the gardener to bait our hooks we were takento the yarrow far up the stream near ladhope</s>  how well one remembersdeserting the gardener and already appreciating the joys of having nogillie nor attendant of being alone with ourselves and the goddess offishing</s>  i cast away as well as i could and presently jerked a trouta tiny one high up in the air out of the water</s>  but he fell off thehook again he dropped in with a little splash and i rushed up toconsult my tutor on his unsportsmanlike behaviour and the disappointingnay heartbreaking occurrence</s>  was the trout not morally caught wasthere no way of getting him to see this and behave accordingly</s>  thegardener feared there was none</s>  meanwhile he sat on the bank and angledin a pool</s>  try my rod he said and as soon as i had taken hold ofit pull up he cried pull up</s>  i did pull up and hauled my firsttroutling on shore</s>  but in my inmost heart i feared that he was not mytrout at all that the gardener had hooked him before he handed the rodto me</s>  then we met my younger brother coming to us with quite a greatfish half a pound perhaps which he had caught in a burn</s>  then for thefirst time my soul knew the fierce passion of jealousy the envy of theangler</s>  almost for the last time too for i know not why it is and itproves me no true fisherman i am not discontented by the successes ofothers</s>  if one cannot catch fish oneself surely the next best thing isto see other people catch them</s> my own progress was now checked for long by a constitutional andinsuperable aversion to angling with worm</s>  if the gardener or a prettygirlcousin of the mature age of fourteen would put the worm on i didnot much mind fishing with it</s>  dost thou remember fair lady of theringlets</s>  still i never liked baitfishing and these mine allies werenot always at hand</s>  we used indeed to have great days with perch atfaldonside on the land which sir walter scott was always so anxious tobuy from mr</s>  nichol milne</s>  almost the last entry in his diary atnaples breathes this unutterable hope</s>  he had deluded himself intobelieving that his debts were paid and that he could soon speak a wordto young nichol milne</s>  the word of course was never spoken and theunsupplanted laird used to let us fish for his perch to our heartsdesire</s>  never was there such slaughter</s>  the corks which we used asfloats were perpetually tipping bobbing and disappearing and then theredfinned perch would fly out on to dry land</s>  here i once saw two corksgo down two anglers haul up and one perch attached to both hooksdescend on the grassy bank</s>  my brother and i filled two baskets onceand strung dozens of other perch on a stick</s> but this was not legitimate business</s>  not till we came to flyfishingwere we really entered at the sport and this initiation took place asit chanced beside the very stream where i was first shown a trout</s>  itis a charming piece of water ambercoloured and clear flowing from themorvern hills under the limes of an ancient avenuetrees that have longsurvived the house to which of old the road must have led</s>  our gillieput on for us big bright seatrout fliesnobody fishes there for yellowtrout but in our inexperience small brownies were all we caught</s> probably we were only taken to streams and shallows where we could notinterfere with mature sportsmen</s>  at all events it was demonstrated tous that we could actually catch fish with fly and since then i havescarcely touched a worm except as a boy in burns</s>  in these early dayswe had no notion of playing a trout</s>  if there was a bite we put ourstrength into an answering tug and if nothing gave way the trout flewover our heads perhaps up into a tree perhaps over into a branch of thestream behind us</s>  quite a large trout will yield to this artless methodif the rod be sturdynone of your gluedup caneaffairs</s>  i rememberhooking a trout which not answering to the first haul ran right acrossthe stream and made for a hole in the opposite bank</s>  but the second liftproved successful and he landed on my side of the water</s>  he had a greatminnow in his throat and must have been a particularly greedy animal</s>  ofcourse on this system there were many breakages and the method wasabandoned as we lived into our teens and began to wade and to understandsomething about flyfishing</s> it was worth while to be a boy then in the south of scotland and to fishthe waters haunted by old legends musical with old songs and renownedin the sporting essays of christopher north and stoddart</s>
in times before the hills were drained before the manufacturing townswere so populous before pollution netting dynamiting poisoningsniggling and the enormous increase of fair and unfair fishing theborder must have been the anglers paradise</s>  still it was not bad whenwe were boys</s>  we had ettrick within a mile of us and a finer naturaltroutstream there is not in scotland though now the water only holds asadly persecuted remnant</s>  there was one long pool behind lindeanflowing beneath a high wooded bank where the trout literally seemednever to cease rising at the flies that dropped from the pendant boughs</s> unluckily the water flowed out of the pool in a thin broad streamdirectly it right angles to the pool itself</s>  thus the angler had so tospeak the whole of lower ettrick at his back when he waded it was along way up stream to the bank and as we never used landingnets thenwe naturally lost a great many trout in trying to unhook them in midwater</s>  they only averaged as a rule from three to two to the pound butthey were strong and lively</s>  in this pool there was a large tawny tableshaped stone over which the current broke</s>  out of the eddy behind thisstone one of my brothers one day caught three trout weighing over sevenpounds a feat which nowadays sounds quite incredible</s>  as soon as thedesirable eddy was empty another trout a trifle smaller than theformer seems to have occupied it</s>  the next mile and a half fromlindean to the junction with tweed was remarkable for excellent sport</s> in the last pool of ettrick the water flowed by a steep bank and ifyou cast almost on to the further side you were perfectly safe to getfish even when the river was very low</s>  the flies used three on a castwere small and dusky hares ear and woodcock wing black palmers or asstoddart sings wee dour looking huiks are the thing mouse body and laverock wing</s> next to ettrick came tweed the former river joins the latter at the bendof a long stretch of water half stream half pool in which angling wasalways good</s>  in late september there were seatrout which for somereason rose to the fly much more freely than seatrout do now in theupper tweed</s>  i particularly remember hooking one just under the railwaybridge</s>  he was a twopounder and practised the usual seatrout tacticsof springing into the air like a rocket</s>  there was a knot on my line ofcourse and i was obliged to hold him hard</s>  when he had been dragged upon the shingle the line parted broken in twain at the knot but it hadlasted just long enough during three exciting minutes</s>  this accident ofa knot on the line has only once befallen me since with the strongestlochtrout i ever encountered</s>  it was on branxholme loch where thetrout run to a great size but usually refuse the fly</s>  i was alone in aboat on a windy day the trout soon ran out the line to the knot andthen there was nothing for it but to lower the top almost to the watersedge and hold on in hope</s>  presently the boat drifted ashore and ilanded himbetter luck than i deserved</s>  people who only know the troutof the test and other chalk streams cannot imagine how much stronger arethe fish of the swift scottish streams and dark scottish lochs</s>  theyreworse fed but they are infinitely more powerful and active it is allthe difference between an alderman and a clansman</s> tweed at this time was full of trout but even then they were not easyto catch</s>  one difficulty lay in the nature of the wading</s>  there is apool near ashiesteil and gleddis weil which illustrated this</s>  here scottand hogg were once upset from a boat while burning the waterspearingsalmon by torchlight</s>  herein too as scott mentions in his diary heonce caught two trout at one cast</s>  the pool is long is paved with smallgravel and allures you to wade on and on</s>  but the water graduallydeepens as you go forward and the pool ends in a deep pot under eachbank</s>  then to recover your ground becomes by no means easy especiallyif the water is heavy</s>  you get halfdrowned or drowned altogetherbefore you discover your danger</s>  many of the pools have thispeculiarity and in many one step made rashly lets you into a veryuncomfortable and perilous place</s>  therefore expeditions to tweedsidewere apt to end in a ducking</s>  it was often hard to reach the water wheretrout were rising and the rise was always capricious</s>  there might notbe a stir on the water for hours and suddenly it would be all boilingwith heads and tails for twenty minutes after which nothing was to bedone</s>  to miss the take was to waste the day at least in flyfishing</s> from a high wooded bank i have seen the trout feeding and they havealmost ceased to feed before i reached the waterside</s>  still worse was itto be allured into water over the tops of your waders early in the dayand then to find that the rise was over and there was nothing for it buta weary walk home the basket laden only with damp boots</s>  still thetrout were undeniably there and that was a great encouragement</s>  theyare there still but infinitely more cunning than of old</s>  then if theywere feeding they took the artificial fly freely now it must be exactlyof the right size and shade or they will have none of it</s>  they comeprovokingly short too just plucking at the hook and running out a footof line or so then taking their departure</s>  for some reason the tweed ismore difficult to fish with the dry fly thanthe test for example</s>  thewater is swifter and very dark it drowns the fly soon and on thesurface the fly is less easily distinguished than at whitchurch in thepellucid streams</s>  the leader a tributary may be fished with dry fly onthe tweed one can hardly manage it</s>  there is a plan by which risingtrout may be takennamely by baiting with a small red worm and castingas in flyfishing</s>  but that is so hard on the worm</s>  probably he who cancatch trout with fly on the tweed between melrose and holy lee can catchthem anywhere</s>  on a good day in april great baskets are still made inpreserved parts of the tweed but if they are made in open water itmust be i fancy with worm or with the screw the lava of the mayfly</s>  the screw is a hideous and venomouslooking animal which is fixedon a particular kind of tackle and cast up stream with a short line</s>  theheaviest trout are fond of it but it can only be used at a season wheneither school or oxford keeps one far from what old franck waltonscontemporary a cromwellian trooper calls the glittering and resolutestreams of tweed</s> difficult as it is that river is so beautiful and alluring that itscarcely needs the attractions of sport</s>  the step banks beautifullywooded

exchange whenshe left elibank with the salmon pool at its foot for bleak hardenfrowning over the narrow den where harden kept the plundered cattle</s> there is no fishing in the tiny harden burn that joins the brawlingborthwick water</s> the burns of the lowlands are now almost barren of trout</s>  the spawningfish flabby and useless are killed in winter</s>  all through the rest ofthe year in the remotest places tourists are hard at them with worm</s>  ina small burn a skilled wormer may almost depopulate the pools and onthe border all is fish that comes to the hook men keep the veryfingerlings on the pretext that they are so sweet in the fryingpan</s> the crowd of anglers in glens which seem not easily accessible isprovoking enough</s>  into the meggat a stream which feeds st</s>  marys lochthere flows the glengaber or glencaber burn the burn of the pinetreestump</s>  the water runs in deep pools and streams over a blue slatey rockwhich contains gold under the sand in the worn holes and crevices</s>  myfriend mr</s>  mcallister the schoolmaster at st</s>  marys tells me that oneday when fish were not rising he scooped out the gravel of one of theseholes with his knife and found a tiny nugget after which thegoldhunting fever came on him for a while</s>  but little is got nowadaysthough in some earlier period the burn has been diverted from its bedand the people used solemnly to wash the sand as in california oraustralia</s>  well whether in consequence of the gold as the alchemicalphilosophers would have held or not the trout of the glengaber burnwere good</s>  they were far shorter thicker and stronger than those of themany neighbouring brooks</s>  i have fished up the burn with fly when itwas very low hiding carefully behind the boulders and have beensurprised at the size and gameness of the fish</s>  as soon as the fly hadtouched the brown water it was sucked down and there was quite a fiercelittle fight before the fish came to hand</s> this all this was in the olden time long ago</s> the glengaber burn is about twenty miles from any railway station buton the last occasion when i visited it three louts were worming theirway up it within twenty yards of each other each lout with his hugerod showing himself wholly to any trout that might be left in the water</s>
 marys loch were almostunfished and rare sport we had in them as boys staying at tibbiesheils famous cottage and sleeping in her boxbeds where so often theettrick shepherd and christopher north have lain after copious toddy</s> tis gone tis gone not in our time will any man like the ettrickshepherd need a cart to carry the trout he has slain in meggat water</s> that stream flowing through a valley furnished with a grassgrown trackfor a road flows as i said into st</s>  marys loch</s>  there are two orthree large pools at the foot of the loch in which as a small boyhardly promoted to fly i have seen many monsters rising greedily</s>  mengot into the way of fishing these pools after a flood with minnow andthereby made huge baskets the big fish running up to feed out of theloch</s>  but when last i rowed past meggat foot the delta of thathistoric stream was simply crowded with anglers stepping in in front ofeach other</s>  i asked if this mob was a political demonstration butthey stuck to business as if they had been on the regents canal</s>  andthis remember was twenty miles from any town</s>  yet there is a burn onthe border still undiscovered still full of greedy trout</s>  i shall givethe angler such a hint of its whereabouts as tiresias in hades gave toodysseus concerning the end of his second wanderings</s> when o stranger thou hast reached a burn where the shepherd asks theefor the newspaper wrapped round thy sandwiches that he may read thenews then erect an altar to priapus god of fishermen and begin toangle boldly</s> probably the troops who fish our borderburns still manage to toss outsome dozens of tiny fishes some six or eight to the pound</s>  are notthese triumphs chronicled in the scotsman</s>  but they cannot imaginewhat angling was in the dead years nor what great trout dwelt below thelinns of the crosscleugh burn beneath the red clusters of the rowantrees or in the waters of the little yarrow above the loch of thelowes</s>  as to the lochs themselves now that anyone may put a boat onthem now that there is perpetual trolling as well as flyfishing sothat every fish knows the lures the fun is mainly over</s>  in april nodoubt something may still be done and in the silver twilights of junewhen as you drift on the still surface you hear the constant sweet plashof the rising trout a few and these good may be taken</s>  but the waterwants restocking and the burns in winter need watching in theinterests of spawning fish</s>  it is nobodys interest that i know of totake trouble and incur expense and free fishing by the constitution ofthe universe must end in bad fishing or in none at all</s>  the best we cansay for it is that vast numbers of persons may by the still waters ofthese meres enjoy the pleasures of hope</s>  even solitude is no longer tobe found in the scene which scott in marmion chooses as of all placesthe most solitary</s>  here have i thought twere sweet to dwell and rear again the chaplains

choicest stream of all wasthen probably the aill described by sir walter in william ofdeloraines midnight ride where aill from mountains freed down from the lakes did raving come each wave was crested

 there is a great pleasure in trying new methodsin labouring after the delicate art of the dry flyfisher in the clearhampshire streams where the glassy tide flows over the waving tresses ofcrowsfoot

they did not rise shyly like the others but went for the flyif it came at all near them and then down they rushed and bolted intothe lilyroots</s> a new plan occurred to me</s>  i put on about eighteen inches of thestoutest gut i had to the end i knotted the biggest seatrout fly ipossessed and hooking the next fish that rose i turned my back on theloch and ran uphill with the rod</s>  looking back i saw a trout well over apound flying across the lilies but alas</s>  the hold was not strong enoughand he fell back</s>  again and again i tried this method invariablyhooking the trout

 as far as fishing goes he is bound tobe clean as the boatmen sayto catch nothing but the solemn peaceand the walls and ruined towers of queen marys prison may partiallyconsole the fisher</s>  the

made by the company which farms the loch stocks itsupplies the boats and regulates the fishing</s>  they permit trolling withangels or phantoms or the natural minnow</s>  now trolling may becomparatively legitimate when the boat is being pulled against the windto its drift but there is no more skill in it than in sitting in anomnibus</s>  but for trolling many a boat would come home

loch was lonely the angler had disappeared</s>  i went on rejoicingand made a pretty good basket as the weather improved and grew warmerachange which gives an appetite to trout in some hill lochs</s>  among thesands between the stones on the farther bank i found traces of theanglers footsteps he was not a phantom at all events for phantoms donot wear heavily nailed boots as he evidently did</s>  the traces whichwere soon lost of course inclined me to think that he had retreated upa narrow green burnside with rather high banks through which in rainyweather a small feeder fell into the loch</s>  i guessed that he had beenfrightened away by the descent of the mist which usually puts down thetrout and prevents them from feeding</s>  in that case his alarm waspremature</s>  i marched homewards happy with the unaccustomed weight of mybasket the contents of which were a welcome change from the usualporridge and potatoes tea without milk jam and scones of theshepherds table</s>  but as i reached the height above the loch on mywestward path and looked back to see if rising fish were dimpling thestill waters all flushed as they were with sunset behold there was theother man at work again</s> i should have thought no more about him had i not twice afterwards seenhim at a distance fishing up a lane ahead of me in the loneliestregions and thereby of course spoiling my sport</s>  i knew him by hispeculiar stoop which seemed not unfamiliar to me and by his hat whichwas of the clerical pattern once known perhaps still known as a biblereadersa low soft slouched black felt</s>  the second time that ifound him thus anticipating me i left off fishing and walked ratherbriskly towards him to satisfy my curiosity and ask the usualquestions what sport</s>  and what flies</s>  but as

this very shy sportsman i went again toloch nan</s>  but this time i took with me a strong fieldglass</s>  as ineared the crest of the low heathery slope immediately above the lochwhence the water

very respectable trout</s>  but he wasfishing on the near side of the loch and though i had quite a distinctview of his back and indeed of all his attenuated form i was as far asever from recognising him or guessing where if anywhere i had seen himbefore</s>  i now determined to stalk him but this was not too easy asthere is literally no cover on the hillside except a long march dyke ofthe usual loose stones which ran down to the lochside and indeed threeor four feet into the loch reaching it at a short distance to the rightof the angler</s>  behind this i skulked in an eagerly undignified mannerand was just about to climb the wall unobserved when two grouse got upwith their wild cluck cluck of alarm and flew down past the angler andover the loch</s>  he did not even look round but jerked his line out ofthe water reeled it up and set off walking along the lochside</s>  he wasmaking no doubt for the little glen up which i fancied that he musthave retreated on the first occasion

distance or the pace</s>  he was first at theburnside and now i cast courtesy and everything but curiosity to thewinds and deliberately followed him</s>  he was a few score of yards aheadof me walking rapidly when he suddenly climbed the burnside to theleft and was lost to my eyes for a few moments</s>  i reached the placeascended the steep green declivity and found myself on the openundulating moor with no human being in sight</s> the grass and heather were short</s>  i saw no bush no hollow where hecould by any possibility have hidden himself</s>  had he met a boojum hecould not have more softly and suddenly vanished away</s> i make no pretence of being more courageous than my neighbours and inthis juncture perhaps i was less so</s>  the long days of loneliness inwaste glen aline and too many solitary cigarettes had probably injuredmy nerve</s>  so when i suddenly heard a sigh and the halfsmothered soundof a convulsive coughhollow if ever a cough was hollowhard by me atmy side as it were and yet could behold no man nor any place where aman might conceal himselfnothing but moor and sky and tufts ofrushesthen i turned away and walked down the glen not slowly</s>  ishall not deny that i often looked over my shoulder as i went and thatwhen i reached the loch i did not angle without many a backward glance</s> such an appearance and disappearance as this i remembered were in

 still ilooked rather cautiously over the edge of the slope above the loch andby jove</s>  there he was fishing the near side and wading deep among thereeds</s>  i did not stalk him this time but set off running down thehillside behind him as quickly as my basket with its load of waders andboots would permit</s>  i was within forty yards of him when he gave awild stagger tried to recover himself failed and this timedisappeared in a perfectly legitimate and accountable manner</s>  thetreacherous peaty bottom had given way and his floating hat with asplash on the surface and a few black bubbles were all that testifiedto his existence</s>  there was a broken old paling hard by i tore off along plank waded in as near as i dared and by help of the plank aftera good deal of slipping which involved an exemplary drenching isucceeded in getting him on to dry land</s>  he was a distressingspectaclehis body and face all blackened with the slimy peatmud andhe fell halffainting on the grass convulsed by a terrible cough</s>  myfirst care was to give him whiskey by perhaps a mistaken impulse ofhumanity my next as he lay exhausted was to bring water in my hatand remove the black mud from his face</s> then i saw percy allenallen of st</s>  judes</s>  his face was wasted histhin long beard he had not worn a beard of old clogged as it was withpeatstains showed flecks of grey</s> allenpercy</s>  i said what wind blew you here</s> but he did not answer and as he coughed it was too plain that theshock of his accident had broken some vessel in the lungs</s>  i tended himas well as i knew how to do it</s>  i sat beside him giving him whatcomfort i might and all the time my memory flew back to college daysand to our strange and most unhappy last meeting and his subsequentinevitable disgrace</s>  far away from hereloch nan and the vacantmoorsmy memory wandered</s> it was at blocksbys auctionroom in a street near the strand on theeve of a great booksale three years before that we had met for almostthe last time as i believed though it is true that we had not spoken onthat occasion</s>  it is necessary that i should explain what occurred orwhat i and three other credible witnesses believed to have occurred forupon my word the more i see and hear of human evidence of any event theless do i regard it as establishing anything better than an excessivelyprobable hypothesis</s> to make a long story as short as may be i should say that allen and ihad been acquainted when we were undergraduates that when fellows ofour respective colleges our acquaintance had become intimate that wehad once shared a little bit of fishing on the test and that we wereboth bookcollectors</s>  i was a comparatively sane bibliomaniac but toallen the time came when he grudged every penny that he did not spend onrare books and when he actually gave up his share of the water we usedto take together that his contribution to the rent might go for rareeditions and bindings</s>  after this deplorable change of character wenaturally saw each other less but we were still friendly</s>  i went up totown to scribble allen stayed on at oxford</s>  one day i chanced to gointo blocksbys rooms it was a friday i rememberthere was to be agreat sale on the monday</s>  there i met allen in ecstasies over one of thebooks displayed in the little side room on the right hand of the saleroom</s>  he had taken out of a glass case and was gloating over a bookwhich it seems had long been the blue rose of his fancy as a collector</s> he was crazed about longepierre the old french amateur whose volumesyou may remember were always bound in blue morocco and tooled on thecentre and at the corners with his badge the golden fleece</s>  now thetome which so fascinated allen was a theocritus published at rome bycaliergusa theocritus on blue paper if you please bound inlongepierres morocco livery double with red morocco and oh ecstasy</s> with a copy of longepierres version of one idyll on the flyleaf signedwith the translators initials and headed a mon roy</s>  it is known tothe curious that louis xiv</s>  particularly admired and praised this littlepoem calling it a model of honourable gallantry</s>

isnecessary though i dare say the book has fallen behind a row of othersand has been found by this time</s>  where were you at a quarter to four</s> i really dont feel obliged to stand a

amessenger to the nearest doctor and procured a kind of sledge generallyused for dragging peat home wherein with abundance of blankets forcovering i hoped to bring allen back to the shepherds

dismal court place of israelite resortwhere dwelt and dealt one isaacs from whom he had at various timesborrowed money on usury</s>  the name of isaacs was over a bell one of manyat the door and when the bell was rung the street door opened of hisown accord like that of the little tobaccoandtalk club which used toexist in an alley off pall mall</s>  allen rang the bell the outer dooropened and as he was standing at the door of isaacs chambers beforehe had knocked that portal also opened and the officeboy a youngjew slunk cautiously out</s>  on seeing allen he had seemed at oncesurprised and alarmed</s>  allen asked if his master was in the ladanswered no in a hesitating way but on second thoughts averred thatisaacs would be back immediately and requested allen to go in andwait</s>  he did so but isaacs never came and allen fell asleep</s>  he had avery distinct and singular dream he said of being in messrs</s>  blocksysrooms of handling the longepierre and of seeing wentworth there

came back to himand not only his memory but his consciousness of what he had whollyforgottennamely that this was saturday the sabbath of the jews andthat there was not the faintest chance of isaacs arrival at his place ofbusiness</s>  in the same moment the embarrassment and confusion of theyoung israelite flashed vividly across his mind and he saw that he wasin a very awkward position</s>  if that fair hebrew boy had been robbing ortrying to rob the till then allens position was serious indeed ashere he was alone at an untimely hour in the office</s>  so he blew thecandle out and went down

not succeed in it</s>  had there been any trouble it islikely enough that he would have involved allen in the grief</s>  then allenwould have been in a perhaps unprecedented position</s>  he could haveestablished an alibi as far as the jews affairs went by proving thathe had been at blocksbys at the hour when the boy would truthfully havesworn that he had let him into isaacs chambers</s>  and as far as thecharge against him at blocksbys went the evidence of the young jewwould have gone to prove that he was at isaacs where he had no businessto be when we saw him at blocksbys</s>  but unhappily each alibi wouldhave been almost equally compromising</s>  the difficulty never arose butthe reason why allen refused to give any account of what he had beendoing and where he had been at four oclock on that saturdayafternoona refusal that told so heavily against himis nowsufficiently clear</s>  his statement would we may believe never have beencorroborated by the youthful hebrew who certainly had his own excellentreasons for silence and who probably had carefully established analibi of his own elsewhere</s> the true account of allens appearance or apparition at blocksbyswhen i
