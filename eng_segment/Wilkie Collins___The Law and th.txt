way out to take advantage of my uncles advice inother words to see how i looked in the glass over the vestry fireplace</s> what does the glass show me</s> the glass shows a tall and slender young woman of threeandtwenty yearsof age</s>  she is not at all the sort of person who attracts attention inthe street seeing that she fails to exhibit the popular yellow hair andthe popular painted cheeks</s>  her hair is black dressed in these laterdays as it was dressed years since to please her father in broadripples drawn back from the forehead and gathered into a simple knotbehind like the hair of the venus de medicis so as to show the neckbeneath</s>  her complexion is pale except in moments of violent agitationthere is no color to be seen in her face</s>  her eyes are of so dark a bluethat they are generally mistaken for black</s>  her eyebrows are well enoughin form but they are too dark and too strongly marked</s>  her nose justinclines toward the aquiline bend and is considered a little too largeby persons difficult to please in the matter of noses</s>  the mouth herbest feature is very delicately shaped and is capable of presentinggreat varieties of expression</s>  as to the face in general it is toonarrow and too long at the lower part too broad and too low in thehigher regions of the eyes and the head</s>  the whole picture as reflectedin the glass represents a woman of some elegance rather too pale andrather too sedate and serious in her moments of silence and reposeinshort a person who fails to strike the ordinary observer at firstsight but who gains in general estimation on a second and sometimeson a third view</s>  as for her dress it studiously conceals instead ofproclaiming that she has been married that morning</s>  she wears a graycashmere tunic trimmed with gray silk and having a skirt of thesame material and color beneath it</s>  on her head is a bonnet to matchrelieved by a quilling of white muslin with one deep red rose as amorsel of positive color to complete the effect of the whole dress</s> have i succeeded or failed in describing the picture of myself which isee in the glass</s>  it is not for me to say</s>  i have done my best to keepclear of the two vanitiesthe vanity of depreciating and the vanity ofpraising my own personal appearance</s>  for the rest well written or badlywritten thank heaven it is done</s> and whom do i see in the glass standing by my side</s> i see a man who is not quite so tall as i am and who has the misfortuneof looking older than his years</s>  his forehead is prematurely bald</s> his big chestnutcolored beard and his long overhanging mustache areprematurely streaked with gray</s>  he has the color in the face which myface wants and the firmness in his figure which my figure wants</s>  helooks at me with the tenderest and gentlest eyes of a light brown thati ever saw in the countenance of a man</s>  his smile is rare and sweet hismanner perfectly quiet and retiring has yet a latent persuasiveness init which is to women irresistibly winning</s>  he just halts a little inhis walk from the effect of an injury received in past years when hewas a soldier serving in india and he carries a thick bamboo canewith a curious crutch handle an old favorite to help himself alongwhenever he gets on his feet in doors or out</s>  with this one littledrawback if it is a drawback there is nothing infirm or old orawkward about him his slight limp when he walks has perhaps to mypartial eyes a certain quaint grace of its own which is pleasanter tosee than the unrestrained activity of other men</s>  and last and bestof all i love him</s>  i love him</s>  i love him</s>  and there is an end of myportrait of my husband on our weddingday</s> the glass has told me all i want to know</s>  we leave the vestry at last</s> the sky cloudy since the morning has darkened while we have beenin the church and the rain is beginning to fall heavily</s>  the idlersoutside stare at us grimly under their umbrellas as we pass throughtheir ranks and hasten into our carriage</s>  no cheering no sunshine noflowers strewn in our path no grand breakfast no genial speeches nobridesmaids no fathers or mothers blessing</s>  a dreary weddingthereis no denying itand if aunt starkweather is right a bad beginning aswell</s> a coup has been reserved for us at the railway station</s>  the attentiveporter on the lookout for his fee pulls down the blinds over the sidewindows of the carriage and shuts out all prying eyes in that way</s> after what seems to be an interminable delay the train starts</s>  myhusband winds his arm round me</s>  at last</s>  he whispers with love inhis eyes that no words can utter and presses me to him gently</s>  my armsteals

of him</s>  before thejourneys end i had my doubts at a little later time i knew for certainthat his thoughts wandering far away from his young wife were allturned inward on his own unhappy self</s> for me the secret pleasure of filling my mind with him while i felt himby my side was a luxury in itself</s> i pictured in my thoughts our first meeting in the neighborhood of myuncles house</s> our famous northcountry trout stream wound its flashing and foaming waythrough a ravine in the rocky moorland</s>  it was a windy shadowy evening</s> a heavily clouded sunset lay low and red in the west</s>  a solitary anglerstood casting his fly at a turn in the stream where the backwater laystill and deep under an overhanging bank</s>  a girl myself standing onthe bank invisible to the fisherman beneath waited eagerly to see thetrout rise</s> the moment came the fish took the fly</s> sometimes on the little level strip of sand at the foot of the banksometimes when the stream turned

the fish</s>  along the bank i followed towatch the contest of skill and cunning between the man and the trout</s> i had lived long enough with my uncle starkweather to catch some of hisenthusiasm for field sports and to learn something especially of theanglers art</s>  still following the stranger with my eyes intently fixedon every movement of his rod and line and with not so much as a chancefragment of my attention to spare for the rough path along which i waswalking i stepped by chance on the loose overhanging earth at the edgeof the bank and fell into the stream in an instant</s> the distance was trifling the water was shallow the bed of the riverwas fortunately for me of sand</s>  beyond the fright and the wetting ihad nothing to complain of</s>  in a few moments i was out of the water andup again very much ashamed of myself on the firm ground</s>  short as theinterval was it proved long enough to favor the escape of the fish</s>  theangler had heard my first instinctive

believe our hearts encountered at the samemoment</s>  this i know for certain we forgot our breeding as lady andgentleman we looked at each other in barbarous silence</s> i was the first to recover myself</s>  what did i say to him</s> i said something about my not being hurt and then something moreurging him to run back and try if he might not yet recover the fish</s> he went back unwillingly</s>  he returned to meof course without the fish</s> knowing how bitterly disappointed my uncle would have been in his placei apologized very earnestly</s>  in my eagerness to make atonement i evenoffered to show him a spot where he might try again lower down thestream</s> he would not hear of it he entreated me to go home and change my wetdress</s>  i cared nothing for the wetting but i obeyed him without knowingwhy</s> he walked with me</s>  my way back to the vicarage was his way back to theinn</s>  he had come to our parts he told me for the quiet and retirementas much as for the fishing</s>  he had noticed me once or twice from thewindow of his room at the inn</s>  he asked if i were not the vicarsdaughter</s> i set him right</s>  i told him that the vicar had married my motherssister and that the two had been father and mother to me since thedeath of my parents</s>  he asked if he might venture to call on doctorstarkweather the next day mentioning the name

angry eustace if i tell you</s>  i said</s>  my uncle as iunderstood him had several motives for writing to the major</s>  one ofthem was to inquire if he knew your mothers address</s> eustace suddenly stood still</s> i paused at the same moment feeling that i could venture no furtherwithout the risk of offending him</s> to speak the truth his conduct when he first mentioned our engagementto my uncle had been so far as appearances went a little flighty andstrange</s>  the vicar had naturally questioned him about his family</s>  he hadanswered that his father was dead and he had consented though not veryreadily to announce his contemplated marriage to his mother</s>  informingus that she too lived in the country he had gone to see her withoutmore particularly mentioning her address</s>  in two days he had returnedto the vicarage with a very startling message</s>  his mother intended nodisrespect to me or my relatives but she disapproved so absolutelyof her sons

starkweathersniece</s>  being asked to explain this extraordinary communication eustacehad told us that his mother and his sisters were bent on his marryinganother lady and that they were bitterly mortified and disappointed byhis choosing a stranger to the family</s>  this explanation was enough forme it implied so far as i was concerned a compliment to my superiorinfluence over eustace which a woman always receives with pleasure</s>  butit failed to satisfy my uncle and my aunt</s>  the vicar expressed to mr</s> woodville a wish to write to his mother or to see her on the subjectof her strange message</s>  eustace obstinately declined to mention hismothers address on the ground that the vicars interference would beutterly useless</s>  my uncle at once drew the conclusion that the mysteryabout the address indicated something wrong</s>  he refused to favor mr</s> woodvilles renewed proposal for my hand and he wrote the same day tomake inquiries of mr</s>  woodvilles reference and of his own friend majorfitzdavid</s> under such circumstances as these to speak of my uncles motives wasto venture on very delicate ground</s>  eustace relieved me from furtherembarrassment by asking a question to which i could easily reply</s> has your uncle received any answer from major fitzdavid</s>  he inquired</s> yes</s> were you allowed to read it</s>  his voice sank as he said

circumstances under whichwe had married of escaping the notice of friends and acquaintances</s> with this object in view having celebrated our marriage privately inlondon we had decided on instructing the sailingmaster of the yacht tojoin us at ramsgate</s>  at this port when the season for visitors was atan end we could embark far more privately than at the popular yachtingstations situated in the isle of wight</s> three days passeddays of delicious solitude of exquisite happinessnever to be forgotten never to be lived over again to the end of ourlives</s> early on the morning of the fourth day just before sunrise a triflingincident happened which was noticeable nevertheless as being strangeto me in my experience of myself</s> i awoke suddenly and unaccountably from a deep and dreamless sleepwith an allpervading sensation of nervous uneasiness which i had neverfelt before</s>  in the old days at the vicarage my capacity as a soundsleeper had been the subject of many a little harmless joke</s>  from themoment when my head was on the pillow i had never known what it was toawake until the maid knocked at my door</s>  at all seasons and times thelong and uninterrupted repose of a child was the repose that i enjoyed</s> and now i had awakened without any assignable cause hours before myusual time</s>  i tried to compose myself to sleep again</s>  the effort wasuseless</s>  such

slippers</s> i went to the window</s>  the sun was just rising over the calm gray sea</s> for a while the majestic spectacle before me exercised a tranquilizinginfluence on the irritable condition of

again</s>  my attention wandered the author was powerlessto recall it</s>  i got on my feet once more and looked at eustace andadmired him and loved him in his tranquil sleep</s>  i went back to thewindow and wearied of the beautiful morning</s>  i sat down before theglass and looked at myself</s>  how haggard and worn i was already throughawaking before my usual time</s>  i rose again not knowing what to do next</s> the confinement to the four walls of the room began to be intolerableto me</s>  i opened the door that led into my husbands dressingroom andentered it to try if the change would relieve me</s> the first object that i noticed was his dressingcase open on thetoilettable</s> i took out the bottles and pots and brushes and combs the knives andscissors in one compartment the writing materials in another</s>  i smelledthe perfumes and pomatums i busily cleaned and dusted the bottleswith my handkerchief as i took them out</s>  little by little i completelyemptied the dressingcase</s>  it was lined with blue velvet</s>  in one corneri noticed a tiny slip of loose blue silk</s>  taking it between my fingerand thumb and drawing it upward i discovered that there was a falsebottom to the case forming a secret compartment for letters and papers</s> in my strange conditioncapricious idle inquisitiveit was anamusement to me to take out the papers just as i had taken outeverything else</s> i found some receipted bills which failed to interest me some letterswhich it is needless to say i laid aside after only looking at theaddresses and under all a photograph face downward with writing onthe back of it</s>  i looked at the writing and saw these wordsto my dear son eustace</s> his mother</s>  the woman who had so obstinately and mercilessly opposedherself to our marriage</s> i eagerly turned the photograph expecting to see a woman with a sternilltempered forbidding countenance</s>  to my surprise the face showedthe remains of great beauty the expression though remarkably firmwas yet winning tender and kind</s>  the gray hair was arranged in rowsof little quaint oldfashioned curls on either side of the head under aplain lace cap</s>  at one corner of the mouth there was a mark apparentlya mole which added to the characteristic peculiarity of the face</s> i looked and looked fixing the portrait thoroughly in my mind</s>  thiswoman who had almost insulted me and my relatives was beyond alldoubt or dispute so far as appearances went a person possessingunusual attractionsa person whom it would be a pleasure and aprivilege to know</s> i fell into deep thought</s>  the discovery of the photograph quieted me asnothing had quieted me yet</s> the striking of a clock downstairs in the hall warned me of the flightof time</s>  i carefully put back all the objects in the dressingcasebeginning with the photograph exactly as i had found them andreturned to the bedroom</s>  as i looked at my husband still sleepingpeacefully the question forced itself into my mind what had made thatgenial gentle mother of his so sternly bent on parting us</s>  so harshlyand pitilessly resolute in asserting her disapproval of our marriage</s> could i put my question openly to eustace when he awoke</s>  no i wasafraid to venture that length</s>  it had been tacitly understood between usthat we were not to speak of his motherand besides he might beangry if

said you have convinced me thati must not ask you to forget on my account the promise which you havegiven to my husband</s>  it is a sacred promise which i too am bound torespecti quite understand

own house</s> the servant returned to us bringing with him a tiny bottle of champagneand a plateful of delicate little sugared biscuits</s> i have had this wine bottled expressly for the ladies said the major</s> the biscuits came to me direct from paris</s>  as a favor to me youmust take some refreshment</s>  and then he stopped and looked at me veryattentively</s>  and then he resumed shall i go to my young prima donnaupstairs and leave you here alone</s> it was impossible to hint more delicately at the one request which inow had it in my mind to make to him</s>  i took his hand and pressed itgratefully</s> the tranquillity of my whole life to come is at stake i said</s>  when iam left here by myself does your generous sympathy permit me to examineeverything in the room</s> he signed to me to drink the champagne and eat a biscuit before he gavehis answer</s> this is serious he said</s>  i wish you to be in perfect possession ofyourself</s>  restore your strengthand then i will speak to you</s> i did as he bade me</s>  in a minute from the time when i drank it thedelicious sparkling wine had begun to revive me</s> is it your express wish he resumed that i should leave you here byyourself to search the room</s> it is my express wish i answered</s> i take a heavy responsibility on myself in granting your request</s>  but igrant it for all that because i sincerely believeas you believethatthe tranquillity of your life to come depends on your discovering thetruth</s>  saying those words he took two keys from his pocket</s>  you willnaturally feel a suspicion he went on of any locked doors that youmay find here</s>  the only locked places in the room are the doors of thecupboards under the long bookcase and the door of the italian cabinetin that corner</s>  the small key opens the bookcase cupboards the longkey opens the cabinet door</s> with that explanation he laid the keys before me on the table</s> thus far he said i have rigidly respected the

 the women have led me into many a rash action in my time</s> have you led me i wonder into the rashest action of all</s> with those ominous last words he bowed gravely and left me alone in theroom</s> chapter x</s>  the search</s> the fire burning in the grate was not a very large one and the outerair as i had noticed on my way to the house had something of a wintrysharpness in it that day</s> still my first feeling when major fitzdavid left me was a feeling ofheat and oppression with its natural result a difficulty in breathingfreely</s>  the nervous agitation of the time was i suppose answerable forthese sensations</s>  i took off my bonnet and mantle and gloves and openedthe window for a little while</s>  nothing was to be seen outside but apaved courtyard with a skylight in the middle closed at the furtherend by the wall of the majors stables</s>  a few minutes at the windowcooled and refreshed me</s>  i shut it down again and took my first stepon the way of discovery</s>  in other words i began my first examination ofthe four walls around me and of all that they inclosed</s> i was amazed at my own calmness</s>  my interview with major fitzdavid hadperhaps exhausted my capacity for feeling any strong emotion for thetime at least</s>  it was a relief to me to be alone it was a relief to meto begin the search</s>  those were my only sensations so far</s> the shape of the room was oblong</s>  of the two shorter walls onecontained the door in grooves which i have already mentioned ascommunicating with the front room the other was almost entirelyoccupied by the broad window which looked out on the courtyard</s> taking the doorway wall first what was there in the shape offurniture on either side of it</s>  there was a cardtable on either side</s> above each cardtable stood a magnificent china bowl placed on a giltand carved bracket fixed to the wall</s> i opened the cardtables</s>  the drawers beneath contained nothing butcards and the usual counters and markers</s>  with the exception of onepack the cards in both tables were still wrapped in their paper coversexactly as they had come from the shop</s>  i examined the loose pack cardby card</s>  no writing no mark of any kind was visible on any one ofthem</s>  assisted by a library ladder which stood against the bookcasei looked next into the two china bowls</s>  both were perfectly empty</s>  wasthere anything more to examine on that side of the room</s>  in the twocorners there were two little chairs of inlaid wood with red silkcushions</s>  i turned them up and looked under the cushions and still imade no discoveries</s>  when i had put the chairs back in their places mysearch on one side of the room was complete</s>  so far i had found nothing</s> i crossed to the opposite wall the wall which contained the window</s> the window occupying as i have said almost the entire length andheight of the wall was divided into three compartments and was adornedat their extremity by handsome curtains of dark red velvet</s>  the ampleheavy folds of the velvet left just room at the two corners of the wallfor two little upright cabinets in buhl containing rows of drawers andsupporting two fine bronze productions reduced in size of the venusmilo and the venus callipyge</s>  i had major fitzdavids permission todo just what i pleased</s>  i opened the si x drawers in each cabinet andexamined their contents without hesitation</s> beginning with the cabinet in the righthand corner my investigationswere soon completed</s>  all the six drawers were alike occupied by acollection of fossils which judging by the curious paper inscriptionsfixed on some of them were associated with a past period of the majorslife when he had speculated not very successfully in mines</s>  aftersatisfying myself that the drawers contained nothing but the fossilsand their inscriptions i turned to the cabinet in the lefthand cornernext</s> here a variety of objects was revealed to view and the examinationaccordingly occupied a much longer time</s> the top drawer contained a complete collection of carpenters tools inminiature relics probably of the fardistant time when the major was aboy and when parents or friends had made him a present of a set of toytools</s>  the second drawer was filled with toys of another sortpresentsmade to major fitzdavid by his fair friends</s>  embroidered braces smartsmokingcaps quaint pincushions gorgeous slippers glittering pursesall bore witness to the popularity of the friend of the women</s>  thecontents of the third drawer were of a less interesting sort the entirespace was filled with old accountbooks ranging over a period ofmany years</s>  after looking into each book and opening and shaking ituselessly in search of any loose papers which might be hidden betweenthe leaves i came to the fourth drawer and found more relics of pastpecuniary transactions in the shape of receipted bills neatly tiedtogether and each inscribed at the back</s>  among the bills i found nearlya dozen loose papers all equally unimportant</s>  the fifth drawer was insad confusion</s>  i took out first a loose bundle of ornamental cards eachcontaining the list of dishes at past banquets given or attended by themajor in london or paris next a box full of delicately tinted quillpens evidently a ladys gift next a quantity of old invitationcards next some dogseared french plays and books of the opera nexta pocketcorkscrew a bundle of cigarettes and a bunch of rusty keyslastly a passport a set of luggage labels a broken silver snuffboxtwo cigarcases and a torn map of rome</s>  nothing anywhere to interestme i thought as i closed the fifth and opened the sixth and lastdrawer</s> the sixth drawer was at once a surprise and a disappointment</s>  itliterally contained nothing but the fragments of a broken vase</s> i was sitting at the time opposite to the cabinet in a low chair</s>  inthe momentary irritation caused by my discovery of the emptiness of thelast drawer i had just lifted my foot to push it back into its placewhen the door communicating with the hall opened and major fitzdavidstood before me</s> his eyes after first meeting mine traveled downward to my foot</s>  theinstant he noticed the open drawer i saw a change in his face</s>  it wasonly for a moment but in that moment he looked at me with a suddensuspicion and surpriselooked as if he had caught me with my hand onthe clew</s> pray dont let me disturb you said major fitzdavid</s>  i have onlycome here to ask you a question</s> what is it major</s> have you met with any letters of mine in the course of yourinvestigations</s> i have found none yet i answered</s>  if i do discover any letters ishall of course not take the liberty of examining them</s> i wanted to speak to you about that he rejoined</s>  it only struck mea moment since upstairs that my letters might embarrass you</s>  in yourplace i should feel some distrust of anything which i was not at libertyto examine</s>  i think i can set this matter right however with verylittle trouble to either of us</s>  it is no violation of any promises orpledges on my part if i simply tell you that my letters will not assistthe discovery which you are trying to make</s>  you can safely pass themover as objects that are not worth examining from your point of view</s> you understand me i am sure</s> i am much obliged to you majori quite understand</s> are you feeling any fatigue</s> none whatever thank you</s> and you still hope to succeed</s>  you are not beginning to be discouragedalready</s> i am not in the least discouraged</s>  with your kind leave i mean topersevere for some time yet</s> i had not closed the drawer of the cabinet while we were talking andi glanced carelessly as i answered him at the fragments of the brokenvase</s>  by this time he had got his feelings under perfect command</s>  hetoo glanced at the fragments of the vase with an appearance of perfectindifference</s>  i remembered the look of suspicion and surprise thathad escaped him on entering the room and i thought his indifference alittle overacted</s> that doesnt look very encouraging he said with a smile pointingto the shattered pieces of china in the drawer</s> appearances are not always to be trusted i replied</s>  the wisest thingi can do in my present situation is to suspect everything even down toa broken vase</s> i looked hard at him as i spoke</s>  he changed the subject</s> does the music upstairs annoy you</s>  he asked</s> not in the least major</s> it will soon be over now</s>  the singingmaster is going and the italianmaster has just arrived</s>  i am sparing no pains to make my young primadonna a most accomplished person</s>  in learning to sing she must alsolearn the language which is especially the language of music</s>  i shallperfect her in the accent when i take her to italy</s>  it is the heightof my ambition to have her mistaken for an italian when she sings inpublic</s>  is there anything i can do before i leave you again</s>  may i sendyou some more champagne</s>  please say yes</s> a thousand thanks major</s>  no more champagne for the present</s> he turned at the door to kiss his hand to me at parting</s>  at the samemoment i saw his eyes wander slyly toward the bookcase</s>  it was only foran instant</s>  i had barely detected him before he was out of the room</s> left by myself again i looked at the bookcaselooked at itattentively for the first time</s> it was a handsome piece of furniture in ancient carved oak and itstood against the wall which ran parallel with the hall of the house</s> excepting the space occupied in the upper corner of the room by thesecond door which opened into the hall the bookcase filled the wholelength of the wall down to the window</s>  the top was ornamented by vasescandelabra and statuettes in pairs placed in a row</s>  looking alongthe row i noticed a vacant space on the top of the bookcase at theextremity of it which was nearest to the window</s>  the opposite extremitynearest to the door was occupied by a handsome painted vase of a verypeculiar pattern</s>  where was the corresponding vase which ought to havebeen placed at the corresponding extremity of the bookcase</s>  i returnedto the open sixth drawer of the cabinet and looked in again</s>  there wasno mistaking the pattern on the fragments when i examined them now</s>  thevase which had been broken was the vase which had stood in the place nowvacant on the top of the bookcase at the end nearest to the window</s> making this discovery i took out the fragments down to the smallestmorsel of the shattered china and examined them carefully one afteranother</s> i was too ignorant of the subject to be able to estimate the value ofthe vase or the antiquity of the vase or even to know whether it wereof british or of foreign manufacture</s>  the ground was of a delicatecreamcolor</s>  the ornaments traced on this were wreaths of flowers andcupids surrounding a medallion on either side of the vase</s>  upon thespace within one of the medallions was painted with exquisite delicacya womans head representing a nymph or a goddess or perhaps a portraitof some celebrated personi was not learned enough to say which</s> the other medallion inclosed the head of a man also treated in theclassical style</s>  reclining shepherds and shepherdesses in watteaucostume with their dogs and their sheep formed the adornments of thepedestal</s>  such had the vase been in the days of its prosperity whenit stood on the top of the bookcase</s>  by what accident had it becomebroken</s>  and why had major fitzdavids face changed when he found thati had discovered the remains of his shattered work of art in the cabinetdrawer</s> the remains left those serious questions unansweredthe remains told meabsolutely nothing</s>  and yet if my own observation of the major were tobe trusted the way to the clew of which i was in search lay directlyor indirectly through the broken vase</s> it was useless to pursue the question knowing no more than i knew now</s> i returned to the bookcase</s> thus far i had assumed without any sufficient reason that the clew ofwhich i was in search must necessarily reveal itself through a writtenpaper of some sort</s>  it now occurred to meafter the movement whichi had detected on the part of the majorthat the clew might quite asprobably present itself in the form of a book</s> i looked along the lower rows of shelves standing just near enough tothem to read the titles on the backs of the volumes</s>  i saw voltaire inred morocco shakespeare in blue walter scott in green the history ofengland in brown the annual register in yellow calf</s>  there i pausedwearied and discouraged already by the long rows of volumes</s>  how ithought to myself am i to examine all these books</s>  and what am i tolook for even if i do examine them all</s> major fitzdavid had spoken of a terrible misfortune which had darkenedmy husbands past life</s>  in what possible way could any trace of thatmisfortune or any suggestive hint of something resembling it exist inthe archives of the annual register or in the pages of voltaire</s> the bare idea of such a thing seemed absurd the mere attempt to make aserious examination in this direction was surely a wanton waste of time</s> and yet the major had certainly stolen a look at the bookcase</s>  andagain the broken vase had once stood on the bookcase</s>  did thesecircumstances justify me in connecting the vase and the bookcase astwin landmarks on the way that led to discovery</s>  the question was not aneasy one to decide on the spur of the moment</s> i looked up at the higher shelves</s> here the collection of books exhibited a greater variety</s>  the volumeswere smaller and were not so carefully arranged as on the lowershelves</s>  some were bound in cloth some were only protected by papercovers one or two had fallen and lay flat on the shelves</s>  here andthere i saw empty spaces from which books had been removed and notreplaced</s>  in short there was no discouraging uniformity in these higherregions of the bookcase</s>  the untidy top shelves looked suggestive ofsome lucky accident which might unexpectedly lead the way to success</s>  idecided if i did examine the bookcase at all to begin at the top</s> where was the library ladder</s> i had left it against the partition wall which divided the back roomfrom the room in front</s>  looking that way i necessarily looked alsotoward the door that ran in groovesthe imperfectly closed door throughwhich i heard major fitzdavid question his servant on the subject ofmy personal appearance when i first entered the house</s>  no one had movedthis door during the time of my visit</s>  everybody entering or leaving theroom had used the other door which led into the hall</s> at the moment when i looked round something stirred in the front room</s> the movement let the light in suddenly through the small open space leftby the partially closed door</s>  had somebody been watching me through thechink</s>  i stepped softly to the door and pushed it back until it waswide open</s>  there was the major discovered in the front room</s>  i saw itin his facehe had been watching me at the bookcase</s> his hat was in his hand</s>  he was evidently going out and he dexterouslytook advantage of that circumstance to give a plausible reason for beingso near the door</s> i hope i didnt frighten you he said</s> you startled me a little major</s> i am so sorry and so ashamed</s>  i was just going to open the door andtell you that i am obliged to go out</s>  i have received a pressing messagefrom a lady</s>  a charming personi should so like you to know her</s>  sheis in sad trouble poor thing</s>  little bills you know and

me at the bookcase</s>  the man who was in myhusbands confidence the man who knew where the clew was to be foundhad been watching me at the bookcase</s>  there was no doubt of it now</s> major fitzdavid had shown me the hidingplace of the secret in spite ofhimself</s> i looked with indifference at the other pieces of furniture rangedagainst the fourth wall which i had not examined yet</s>  i surveyedwithout the slightest feeling of curiosity all the little eleganttrifles scattered on the tables and on the chimneypiece each oneof which might have been an object of suspicion to me under othercircumstances</s>  even the watercolor drawings failed to interest me in mypresent frame of mind</s>  i observed languidly that they were most ofthem portraits of ladiesfair idols no doubt of the majors facileadorationand i cared to notice no more</s>  my business in that room iwas certain of it now</s>  began and ended with the bookcase</s>  i leftmy seat to fetch the library ladder determining to begin the work ofinvestigation on the top shelves</s> on my way to the ladder i passed one of the tables and saw the keyslying on it which major fitzdavid had left at my disposal</s> the smaller of the two keys instantly reminded me of the cupboards underthe bookcase</s>  i had strangely overlooked these</s>  a vague distrust of thelocked doors a vague doubt of what they might be hiding from me stoleinto my mind</s>  i left the ladder in its place against the wall and setmyself to examine the contents of the cupboards first</s> the cupboards were three in number</s>  as i opened the first of themthe singing upstairs ceased</s>  for a moment there was something almostoppressive in the sudden change from noise to silence</s>  i suppose mynerves must have been overwrought</s>  the next sound in the housenothingmore remarkable than the creaking of a mans boots descendingthe stairsmade me shudder all over</s>  the man was no doubt thesingingmaster going away after giving his lesson</s>  i heard the housedoor close on him and started at the familiar sound as if it weresomething terrible which i had never heard before</s>  then there wassilence again</s>  i roused myself as well as i could and began myexamination of the first cupboard</s> it was divided into two compartments</s> the top compartment contained nothing but boxes of cigars ranged inrows one on another</s>  the under compartment was devoted to a collectionof shells</s>  they were all huddled together anyhow the major evidentlysetting a far higher value on his cigars than on his shells</s>  i searchedthis lower compartment carefully for any object interesting to me whichmight be hidden in it</s>  nothing was to be found in any part of it besidesthe shells</s> as i opened the second cupboard it struck me that the light wasbeginning to fail</s> i looked at the window it was hardly evening yet</s>  the darkening of thelight was produced by gathering clouds</s>  raindrops pattered againstthe glass the autumn wind whistled mournfully in the corners of thecourtyard</s>  i mended the fire before i renewed my search</s>  my nerves werein fault again i suppose</s>  i shivered when i went back to the bookcase</s> my hands trembled i wondered what was the matter with me</s> the second cupboard revealed in the upper division of it some reallybeautiful cameosnot mounted but laid on cottonwool in neat cardboardtrays</s>  in one corner half hidden under one of the trays there peepedout the whit e leaves of a little manuscript</s>  i pounced on it eagerlyonly to meet with a new disappointment the manuscript proved to be adescriptive catalogue of the cameosnothing more</s> turning to the lower division of the cupboard i found more costlycuriosities in the shape of ivory carvings from japan and specimens ofrare silk from china</s>  i began to feel weary of disinterring the majorstreasures</s>  the longer i searched the farther i seemed to remove myselffrom the one object that i had it at heart to attain</s>  after closing thedoor of the second cupboard i almost doubted whether it would be worthmy while to proceed farther and open the third and last door</s> a little reflection convinced me that it would be as well now that ihad begun my examination of the lower regions of the bookcase to go onwith it to the end</s>  i opened the last cupboard</s> on the upper shelf there appeared in solitary grandeur one objectonlya gorgeously bound book</s> it was of a larger size than usual judging of it by comparison withthe dimensions of modern volumes</s>  the binding was of blue velvet withclasps of silver worked in beautiful arabesque patterns and with a lockof the same precious metal to protect the book from prying eyes</s>  when itook it up i found that the lock was not closed</s> had i any right to take advantage of this accident and open the book</s> i have put the question since to some of my friends of both sexes</s>  thewomen all agree that i was perfectly justified considering the seriousinterests that i had at stake in taking any advantage of any book inthe majors house</s>  the men differ from this view and declare that iought to have put back the volume in blue velvet unopened carefullyguarding myself from any aftertemptation to look at it again by lockingthe cupboard door</s>  i dare say the men are right</s> being a woman however i opened the book without a moments hesitation</s> the leaves were of the finest vellum with tastefully designedilluminations all round them</s>  and what did these highly ornamental pagescontain</s>  to my unutterable amazement and disgust they contained locksof hair let neatly into the center of each page with inscriptionsbeneath which proved them to be lovetokens from various ladies who hadtouched the majors susceptible heart at different periods of his life</s>
the inscriptions were written in other languages besides english butthey appeared to be all equally devoted to the same curious purposenamely to reminding the major of the dates at which his variousattachments had come to an untimely end</s>  thus the first page exhibiteda lock of the lightest flaxen hair with these lines beneath my adoredmadeline</s>  eternal constancy</s>  alas july 22 1839</s>  the next page wasadorned by a darker shade of hair with a french inscription under itclemence</s>

the lady was descended from the ancient romans and wastherefore mourned appropriately in latin by her devoted fitzdavid</s> more shades of hair and more inscriptions followed until i was weary oflooking at them</s>  i put down the book disgusted with the creatureswho had assisted in filling it and then took it up again by anafterthought</s>  thus far i had thoroughly searched everything that hadpresented itself to my notice</s>  agreeable or not agreeable it wasplainly of serious importance to my own interests to go on as i hadbegun and thoroughly to search the book</s> i turned over the pages until i came to the first blank leaf</s>  seeingthat they were all blank leaves from this place to the end i lifted thevolume by the back and as a last measure of precaution shook it so asto dislodge any loose papers or cards which might have escaped my noticebetween the leaves</s> this time my patience was rewarded by a discovery which indescribablyirritated and distressed me</s> a small photograph mounted on a card fell out of the book</s>  a firstglance showed me that it represented the portraits of two persons</s> one of the persons i recognized as my husband</s> the other person was a woman</s> her face was entirely unknown to me</s>  she was not young</s>  the picturerepresented her seated on a chair with my husband standing behind andbending over her holding one of her

noticed the familiarly affectionate action bywhich the artist with the permission of his sitters of course hadconnected the two figures in a group</s>  eustace had briefly told me inthe days of our courtship that he had more than once fancied himselfto be in love before he met with me</s>  could this very unattractive womanhave been one of the early objects of his admiration</s>  had she been nearenough and dear enough to him to be photographed with her hand in his</s>  ilooked and looked at the portraits until i could endure them no longer</s> women are strange creaturesmysteries even to themselves</s>  i threw thephotograph from me into a corner of the cupboard</s>  i was savagely angrywith my husband i hatedyes hated with all my heart and soul</s> thewoman who had got his hand in hersthe unknown woman with theselfwilled hardfeatured face</s> all this time the lower shelf of the cupboard was still waiting to belooked over</s> i knelt down to examine it eager to clear my mind if i could of thedegrading jealousy that had got possession of me</s> unfortunately the lower shelf contained nothing but relics of themajors military life comprising his sword and pistols his epauletshis sash and other minor accouterments</s>  none of these objects excitedthe slightest interest in me</s>  my eyes wandered back to the uppershelf and like the fool i was there is no milder word that canfitly describe me at that moment i took the photograph out again andenraged myself uselessly by another look at it</s>  this time i observedwhat i had not noticed before that there were some lines of writing ina womans hand at the back of the portraits</s>  the lines ran thusto major fitzdavid with two vases</s>  from his friends s</s>  and e</s>  m</s> was one of those two vases the vase that had been broken</s>  and was thechange that i had noticed in major fitzdavids face produced by somepast association in connection with it which in some way affectedme</s>  it might or might

in my bedroom</s> the windowblind was up and the autumn moonlight shone brilliantly intothe little room</s> as i stood by the window looking out the memory came to me of anothermoonlight night when eustace and i were walking together in thevicarage garden before our marriage</s>  it was the night of which i havewritten many pages back when there were obstacles to our union andwhen eustace had offered to release me from my engagement to him</s>  i sawthe dear face again looking at me in the moonlight i heard oncemore his words and mine</s>  forgive me he had said for having

said to myself</s>  neitherrelations nor friends shall prevail on me to falter and fail in myhusbands cause</s>
 the assertion of his innocence is the work of my lifei will begin it tonight</s> i drew down the blind and lighted the candles</s>  in the quiet night aloneand unaided i took my first step on the toilsome and terrible journeythat lay before me</s>  from the titlepage to the end without stopping torest and without missing a word i read the trial of my husband for themurder of his wife</s> part ii</s>  paradise regained</s> chapter xv</s>  the story of the trial</s>  the preliminaries</s> let me confess another weakness on my part before i begin the storyof the trial</s>  i cannot prevail upon myself to copy for the second timethe horrible titlepage which holds up to public ignominy my husbandsname</s>  i have copied it once in my tenth chapter</s>  let once be enough</s> turning to the second page of the trial i found a note assuring thereader of the absolute correctness of the report of the proceedings</s>  thecompiler described himself as having enjoyed certain special privileges</s> thus the presiding judge had himself revised his charge to the jury</s> and again the chief lawyers for the prosecution and the defensefollowing the judges example had revised their speeches for andagainst the prisoner</s>  lastly particular care had been taken to secure aliterally correct report of the evidence given by the various witnesses</s> it was some relief to me to discover this note and to be satisfied atthe outset that the story of the trial was in every particular fullyand truly given</s> the next page interested me more nearly still</s>  it enumerated the actorsin the judicial dramathe men who held in their hands my husbandshonor and my husbands life</s>  here is the list  the lord justice clerk  lord drumfennick judges on the bench</s>    lord

prisoner then followed</s>  i shall not copy theuncouth language full of needless repetitions and if i know anythingof the subject not guiltless of bad grammar as well in which myinnocent husband was solemnly and falsely accused of poisoning his firstwife</s>  the less there is of that false and hateful indictment on thispage the better and truer the page will look to my eyes</s> to be brief then eustace macallan was indicted and accused at theinstance of david mintlaw esquire her majestys advocate for hermajestys interest of the murder of his wife by poison at hisresidence called gleninch in the county of midlothian</s>  the poison wasalleged to have been wickedly and feloniously given by the prisoner tohis wife sara on two occasions in the form of arsenic administeredin tea medicine or other article or articles of food or drink to theprosecutor unknown</s>  it was further declared that the prisoners wifehad died of the poison thus administered b y her husband on one orother or both of the stated occasions and that she was thus murderedby her husband</s>  the next paragraph asserted that the saideustace macallan taken before john daviot esquire advocatesheriffsubstitute of midlothian did in his presence at edinburghon a given date viz</s>  the 29th of october subscribe a declarationstating his innocence of the alleged crime this declaration beingreserved in the indictmenttogether with certain documents papers andarticles enumerated in an inventoryto be used in evidence against theprisoner</s>  the indictment concluded by declaring that in the eventof the offense charged against the prisoner being found proven by theverdict he the said eustace macallan ought to be punished with thepains of the law to deter others from committing like crimes in alltime coming</s> so much for the indictment</s>  i have done with itand i am rejoiced to bedone with it</s> an inventory of papers documents and articles followed at great lengthon the next three pages</s>  this in its turn was succeeded by the listof the witnesses and by the names of the jurors fifteen in numberballoted for to try the case</s>  and then at last the report of the trialbegan</s>  it resolved itself to my mind into three great questions</s>  as itappeared to me at the time so let me present it here</s> chapter xvi</s>  first questiondid the woman die poisoned</s> the proceedings began at ten oclock</s>  the prisoner was placed atthe bar before the high court of justiciary at edinburgh</s>  he bowedrespectfully to the bench and pleaded not guilty in a low voice</s> it was observed by every one present that the prisoners face betrayedtraces of acute mental suffering</s>  he was deadly pale</s>  his eyes neveronce wandered to the crowd in the court</s>  when certain witnesses appearedagainst him he looked at them with a momentary attention</s>  at othertimes he kept his eyes on the ground</s>  when the evidence touched on hiswifes illness and death he was deeply affected and covered his facewith his hands</s>  it was a subject of general remark and general surprisethat the prisoner in this case although a man showed far lessselfpossession than the last prisoner tried in that court for murderawoman who had been convicted on overwhelming evidence</s>  there werepersons present a small minority only who considered this wantof composure on the part of the prisoner to be a sign in his favor</s> selfpossession in his dreadful position signified to their mindsthe stark insensibility of a heartless and shameless criminal andafforded in itself a presumption not of innocence but of guilt</s> the first witness called was john daviot esquire sheriffsubstituteof midlothian</s>  he was examined by the lord advocate as counsel for theprosecution and saidthe prisoner was brought before me on the present charge</s>  he madeand subscribed a declaration on the 29th of october</s>  it was freelyand voluntarily made the prisoner having been first duly warned andadmonished</s> having identified the declaration the sheriffsubstitutebeingcrossexamined by the dean of faculty as counsel for thedefensecontinued his evidence in these wordsthe charge against the prisoner was murder</s>  this was communicatedto him before he made the declaration</s>  the questions addressed tothe prisoner were put partly by me partly by another officer theprocuratorfiscal</s>  the answers were given distinctly and so far asi could judge without reserve</s>  the statements put forward inthe declaration were all made in answer to questions asked by theprocuratorfiscal or by myself</s> a clerk in the sheriffclerks office then officially produced thedeclaration and corroborated the evidence of the witness who hadpreceded him</s> the appearance of the next witness created a marked sensation in thecourt</s>  this was no less a person than the nurse who had attended mrs</s>
macallan in her last illnessby name christina ormsay</s> after the first formal answers the nurse examined by the lordadvocate proceeded to sayi was first sent for to attend the deceased lady on the 7th of october</s>
she was then suffering from a severe cold accompanied by a rheumaticaffection of the left kneejoint</s>  previous to this i understood thather health had been fairly good</s>  she was not a very difficult person tonurse when you got used to her and understood how to manage her</s>  themain difficulty was caused by her temper</s>  she was not a sullen personshe was headstrong and violenteasily excited to fly into a passionand quite reckless in her fits of anger as to what she said or did</s>  atsuch times i really hardly think she knew what she was about</s>  my ownidea is that her temper was made still more irritable by unhappiness inher married life</s>  she was far from being a reserved person</s>  indeedshe was disposed as i thought to be a little too communicative aboutherself and her troubles with persons like me who were beneath her instation</s>  she did not scruple for instance to tell me when we hadbeen long enough together to get used to each other that she was veryunhappy and fretted a good deal about her husband</s>  one night when shewas wakeful and restless she said to methe dean of faculty here interposed speaking on the prisoners behalf</s> he appealed to the judges to say whether such loose and unreliableevidence as this was evidence which could be received by the court</s> the lord advocate speaking on behalf of the crown claimed it as hisright to produce the evidence</s>  it was of the utmost importance in thiscase to show on the testimony of an unprejudiced witness on what termsthe husband and wife were living</s>  the witness was a most respectablewoman</s>  she had won and deserved the confidence of the unhappy ladywhom she attended on her deathbed</s> after briefly consulting together the judges unanimously decided thatthe evidence could not be admitted</s>  what the witness had herself seenand observed of the relations between the husband and wife was the onlyevidence that they could receive</s> the lord advocate thereupon continued his examination of the witness</s> christina ormsay resumed her evidence as followsmy position as nurse led necessarily to my seeing more of mrs</s>  macallanthan any other person in the house</s>  i am able to speak from experienceof many things not known to others who were only in her room atintervals</s> for instance i had more than one opportunity of personally observingthat mr</s>  and mrs</s>  macallan did not live together very happily</s>  i cangive you an example of this not drawn from what others told me butfrom what i noticed for myself</s> toward the latter part of my attendance on mrs</s>  macallan a young widowlady named mrs</s>  beaulya cousin of mr</s>  macallanscame to stay atgleninch</s>  mrs</s>  macallan was jealous of this lady and she showed it inmy presence only the day before her death when mr</s>  macallan came intoher room to inquire how she had passed the night</s>  oh she said nevermind how i have slept</s>  what do you care whether i sleep well or ill</s> how has mrs</s>  beauly passed the night</s>  is she more beautiful than everthis morning</s>  go back to herpray go back to her</s>  dont waste your timewith me</s>  beginning in that manner she worked herself into one of herfurious rages</s>  i was brushing her hair at the time and feeling thatmy presence was an impropriety under the circumstances i attempted toleave the room</s>  she forbade me to go</s>  mr</s>  macallan felt as i did thatmy duty was to withdraw and he said so in plain words</s>  mrs</s>  macallaninsisted on my staying in language so insolent to her husband that hesaid if you cannot control yourself either the nurse leaves the roomor i do</s>  she refused to yield even then</s>  a good excuse she saidfor getting back to mrs</s>  beauly</s>  go</s>  he took her at her word andwalked out of the room</s>  he had barely closed the door before she beganreviling him to me in the most shocking manner</s>  she declared amongother things she said of him that the news of all others which he wouldbe most glad to hear would be the news of her death</s>  i ventured quiterespectfully on remonstrating with her</s>  she took up the hairbrush andthrew it at me and then and there dismissed me from my attendance onher</s>  i left her and waited below until her fit of passion had wornitself out</s>  then i returned to my place at the bedside and for a whilethings went on again as usual</s> it may not be amiss to add a word which may help to explain mrs</s> macallans jealousy of her husbands cousin</s>  mrs</s>  macallan was a veryplain woman</s>  she had a cast in one of her eyes and if i may use theexpression one of the most muddy blotchy complexions it was ever mymisfortune to see in a persons face</s>  mrs</s>  beauly on the other handwas a most attractive lady</s>  her eyes were universally admired and shehad a most beautifully clear and delicate color</s>  poor mrs</s>  macallan saidof her most untruly that she painted</s> no the defects in the complexion of the deceased lady were not inany way attributable to her illness</s>  i should call them born and breddefects in herself</s> her illness if i am asked to describe it i should say wastroublesomenothing more</s>  until the last day there were no symptomsin the least degree serious about the malady that had taken her</s> her rheumatic knee was painful of courseacutely painful if youlikewhen she moved it and the confinement to bed was irksome enoughno doubt</s>  but otherwise there was nothing in the ladys conditionbefore the fatal attack came to alarm her or anybody about her</s>  she hadher books and her writing materials on an invalid table which worked ona pivot and could be arranged in any position most agreeable to her</s> at times she read and wrote a good deal</s>  at other times she lay quietthinking her own thoughts or talking with me and with one or two ladyfriends in the neighborhood who came regularly to see her</s> her writing so far as i knew was almost entirely of the poeticalsort</s>  she was a great hand at composing poetry</s>  on one occasion only sheshowed me some of her poems</s>  i am no judge of such things</s>  her poetrywas of the dismal kind despairing about herself and wondering why shehad ever been born and nonsense like that</s>  her husband came in morethan once for some hard hits at his cruel heart and his ignorance of hiswifes merits</s>  in short she vented her discontent with her pen as wellas with her tongue</s>  there were timesand pretty often toowhen anangel from heaven would have failed to have satisfied mrs</s>  macallan</s> throughout the period of her illness the deceased lady occupied thesame rooma large bedroom situated like all the best bedrooms on thefirst floor of the house</s> yes the plan of the room now shown to me is quite accurately takenaccording to my remembrance of it</s>  one door led into the great passageor corridor on which all the doors opened</s>  a second door at one sidemarked b on the plan led to mr</s>  macallans sleepingroom</s>  a thirddoor on the opposite side marked c on the plan communicated witha little study or bookroom used as i was told by mr</s>  macallansmother when she was staying at gleninch but seldom or never enteredby any one else</s>  mr</s>  macallans mother was not at gleninch while i wasthere</s>  the door between the bedroom and this study was locked and thekey was taken out</s>  i dont know who had the key or whether therewere more keys than one in existence</s>  the door was never opened tomy knowledge</s>  i only got into the study to look at it along with thehousekeeper by entering through a second door that opened on to thecorridor</s> i beg to say that i can speak from my own knowledge positively aboutmrs</s>  macallans illness and about the sudden change which ended inher death</s>  by the doctors advice i made notes at the time of dates andhours and such like</s>  i looked at my notes before coming here</s> from the 7th of october when i was first called in to nurse her tothe 20th of the same month she slowly but steadily improved in health</s> her knee was still painful no doubt but the inflammatory look of itwas disappearing</s>  as to the other symptoms except weakness from lyingin bed and irritability of temper there was really nothing the matterwith her</s>  she slept badly i ought perhaps to add</s>  but we remediedthis by means of composing draughts prescribed for that purpose by thedoctor</s> on the morning of the 21st at a few minutes past six i got my firstalarm that something was going wrong with mrs</s>  macallan</s> i was awoke at the time i have mentioned by the ringing of thehandbell which she kept on her bedtable</s>  let me say for myself thati had only fallen asleep on the sofa in the bedroom at past two in themorning from sheer fatigue</s>  mrs</s>  macallan was then awake</s>  she was inone of her bad humors with me</s>  i had tried to prevail on her to let meremove her dressingcase from her bedtable after she had used it inmaking her toilet for the night</s>  it took up a great deal of room andshe could not possibly want it again before the morning</s>  but no sheinsisted on my letting it be</s>  there was a glass inside the case andplain as she was she never wearied of looking at herself in that glass</s> i saw that she was in a bad state of temper so i gave her her way andlet the dressingcase be</s>  finding that she was too sullen to speak to meafter that and too obstinate to take her composing draught from mewhen i offered it i laid me down on the sofa at her bed foot and fellasleep as i have said</s> the moment her bell rang i was up and at the bedside ready to makemyself useful</s> i asked what was the matter with her</s>  she complained of faintness anddepression and said she felt sick</s>  i inquired if she had taken anythingin the way of physic or food while i had been asleep</s>  she answered thather husband had come in about an hour since and finding her stillsleepless had himself administered the composing draught</s>  mr</s>  macallansleeping in the next room joined us while she was speaking</s>  he too hadbeen aroused by the bell</s>  he heard what mrs</s>  macallan said to me aboutthe composing draught and made no remark upon it</s>  it seemed to me thathe was alarmed at his wifes faintness</s>  i suggested that she should takea little wine or brandy and water</s>  she answered that she could swallownothing so strong as wine or brandy having a burning pain in herstomach already</s>  i put my hand on her stomachquite lightly</s>  shescreamed when i touched her</s> this symptom alarmed us</s>  we went to the village for the medical man whohad attended mrs</s>  macallan

 not long after taking it she was sick</s>  the sicknessappeared to relieve her</s>  she soon grew drowsy and slumbered</s>  mr</s>  galeleft us with strict injunctions to send for him instantly if

that he had returned to his own room andasked if i should send for him</s>  she said no</s>  i asked next if she wouldlike anything to eat or drink</s>  she said no again in rather a vacantstupefied way and then told me to go downstairs and get my breakfast</s> on my way down i met the housekeeper</s>  she invited me to breakfast withher in her room instead of in the servants hall as usual</s>  i remainedwith the housekeeper but a short timecertainly not more than half anhour</s> coming upstairs again i met the underhousemaid sweeping on one of thelandings</s> the girl informed me that mrs</s>  macallan had taken a cup of tea duringmy absence in the housekeepers room</s>  mr</s>  macallans valet had orderedthe tea for his mistress by his masters directions</s>  the underhousemaidmade it and took it upstairs herself to mrs</s>  macallans room</s>  hermaster she said opened the door when she knocked and took the teacupfrom her with his own hand</s>  he opened the door widely enough for her tosee into the bedroom and to notice that nobody was with mrs</s>  macallanbut himself</s> after a little talk with the underhousemaid i returned to thebedroom</s>  no one was there</s>  mrs</s>  macallan was lying perfectly quiet withher face turned away from me on the pillow</s>  approaching the bedside ikicked against something on the floor</s>  it was a broken teacup</s>  i saidto mrs</s>  macallan how comes the teacup to be broken maam</s>  sheanswered without turning toward me in an odd muffled kind of voicei dropped it</s>  before you drank your tea maam</s>  i asked</s>  no shesaid in handing the cup back to mr</s>  macallan after i had done</s>  i hadput my question wishing to know in case she had spilled the tea whenshe dropped the cup whether it would be necessary to get her

heard mr</s>  macallan say</s>  where is mrs</s>  beauly</s>  have youseen anything of her</s> mr</s>  dexter answered in his quick offhand way of speaking not i</s>  iknow nothing about her</s> then i advanced and begging pardon for intruding i mentioned to mr</s> macallan the difficulty i was in about going back or not to his wifesroom without waiting until she rang for me</s>  before he could advise mein the matter the footman made his appearance and informed me that mrs</s> macallans bell was then ringingand ringing violently</s> it was then close on eleven oclock</s>  as fast as i could

jerome called me back for a moment and told me to give himthe key of the door</s>  i did so of course but i thought this also verystrange</s>  when i got down to the servants hall i found there was

 from his lips i first heardthe startling news</s>  both the doctors had refused to give the usualcertificate of death</s>  there was to be a medical examination of the bodythe next morning</s> there the examination of the nurse christina ormsay came to an end</s> ignorant as i was of the law i could see what impression the evidenceso far was intended to produce on the minds of the jury</s>  after firstshowing that my husband had had two opportunities of administering thepoisononce in the medicine and once in the teathe counsel forthe crown led the jury to infer that the prisoner had taken thoseopportunities to rid himself of an ugly and jealous wife whosedetestable temper he could no longer endure</s> having directed his examination to the attainment of this object thelord advocate had done with the witness</s>  the dean of facultyacting inthe prisoners intereststhen rose to bring out the favorable side ofthe wifes character by crossexamining the nurse</s>  if he succeeded inthis attempt the jury might reconsider their conclusion that the wifewas a person who had exasperated her husband beyond endurance</s>  in thatcase where so far was the husbands motive for poisoning her</s>  andwhere was the presumption of the prisoners guilt</s> pressed by this skillful lawyer the nurse was obliged to exhibit myhusbands first wife under an entirely new aspect</s>  here is the substanceof what the dean of faculty extracted from christina ormsayi persist in declaring that mrs</s>  macallan had a most violent temper</s> but she was certainly in the habit of making amends for the offense thatshe gave by her violence</s>  when she was quiet again she always made herexcuses to me and she made them with a good grace</s>  her manners wereengaging at such times as these</s>  she spoke and acted like a wellbredlady</s>  then again as to her personal appearance</s>  plain as she was inface she had a good figure her hands and feet i was told had beenmodeled by a sculptor</s>  she had a very pleasant voice and she wasreported when in health to sing beautifully</s>  she was also if her maidsaccount was to be trusted a pattern in the matter of dressing for theother ladies in

wasthrough mrs</s>  macallan that mrs</s>  beauly was in the house</s>  mrs</s>  beauly hadwished to postpone her visit on account of the state of mrs</s>  macallanshealth</s>  it was mrs</s>  macallan herselfnot her husbandwho decided thatmrs</s>  beauly should not be disappointed and should pay her visit togleninch then and there</s>  further mrs</s>  macallan in spite of her temperwas popular with her friends and popular with her servants</s>  there washardly a dry eye in the house when it was known she was dying</s>  andfurther still in those little domestic disagreements at which the nursehad been present mr</s>  macallan had never lost his temper and had neverused harsh language he seemed to be more sorry than angry when thequarrels took place</s> moral for the jury was this the sort of womanwho would exasperate a man into poisoning her</s>  and was this the sort ofman who would be capable of poisoning his wife</s> having produced this salutary counterimpression the dean of facultysat down and the medical witnesses were called next</s> here the evidence was simply irresistible</s> dr</s>  jerome and mr</s>  gale positively swore that the symptoms of theillness were the symptoms of poisoning by arsenic</s>  the surgeon who hadperformed the postmortem examination followed</s>  he positively swore thatthe appearance of the internal organs proved doctor jerome and mr</s>  galeto be right in declaring that their patient had died poisoned</s>  lastlyto complete this overwhelming testimony two analytical chemistsactually produced in court the arsenic which they had found in the bodyin a quantity admittedly sufficient to have killed two persons insteadof one</s>  in the face of such evidence as this crossexamination was amere form</s>  the first question

manymore verses on many more sheets of paper in the same handwriting</s>  wealso discovered first some letters and next a crumpled piece of paperthrown aside in a corner of one of the shelves</s>  on closer examination achemists printed label was discovered on this morsel of paper</s>  we alsofound in the folds of it a few scattered grains of some white powder</s> the paper and the letters were carefully inclosed and sealed up asbefore</s> further investigation of the room revealed nothing which could throwany light on the purpose of our inquiry</s>  we examined the clothesjewelry and books of the deceased</s>  these we left under lock and key</s>  wealso found her dressingcase which we protected by seals and took awaywith us to the fiscals office along with all the other articles thatwe had discovered in the room</s> the next day we continued our examination in the house having receivedin the interval fresh instructions from the fiscal</s>  we began our work inthe bedroom communicating with the room in which mrs</s>  macallan haddied</s>  it had been kept locked since the death</s>  finding nothing of anyimportance here we went next to another room on the same floor

it</s>  he wasreported to be quite incapable of exerting himself and quite unfitto see strangers</s>  we insisted nevertheless in deference to ourinstructions on obtaining admission to his room</s>  he made no replywhen we inquired whether he had or had not removed anything from thesleepingroom next to his late wifes which he usually occupied to thesleepingroom in which he now lay</s>  all he did was to close his eyes asif he were too feeble to speak to us or to notice us</s>  without furtherdisturbing him we began to examine the room and the different objectsin it</s> while we were so employed we were interrupted by a strange sound</s>  welikened it to the rumbling of wheels in the corridor outside</s> the door opened and there came swiftly in a gentlemanacripplewheeling himself

pointed out particularly thathe had got his chair in such a position against the bedside table asto prevent us from examining it</s>  he only laughed</s>  cant you see foryourselves he said that it is a table and nothing more</s>  in replyto this we warned him that we were acting under a legal warrant andthat he might get into trouble if he obstructed us in the executionof our duty</s>  finding there was no moving him by fair means i took hischair and pulled it away while robert lorrie laid hold of the tableand carried it to the other end of the room</s>  the crippled gentleman flewinto a furious rage with me for presuming to touch his chair</s>  my chairis me he said how dare you lay hands on me</s>  i first opened thedoor and then by way of accommodating him gave the chair a good pushbehind with my stick instead of my hand and so sent it and him safelyand swiftly out of the room</s> having locked the door so as to prevent any further intrusion ijoined robert lorrie in examining the bedside table</s>  it had one drawerin it and that drawer we found secured</s> we asked the prisoner for the key</s> he flatly refused to give it to us and said we had no right to unlockhis drawers</s>  he was so angry that he even declared it was lucky for ushe was too weak to rise from his bed</s>  i answered civilly that our dutyobliged us to examine the drawer and that if he still declined toproduce the key he would only oblige us to take the table away and havethe lock opened by a smith</s> while we were still disputing there was a knock at the door of theroom</s> i opened the door cautiously</s>  instead of the crippled gentleman whom ihad expected to see again there was another stranger standing outside</s> the prisoner hailed him as a friend and neighbor and eagerly calledupon him for protection from us</s>  we found this second gentleman pleasantenough to deal with</s>  he informed us readily that he had been sent forby mr</s>  dexter and that he was himself a lawyer and he asked to seeour warrant</s>  having looked at it he at once informed the prisonerevidently very much to the prisoners surprise that he must submit tohave the drawer examined under protest</s>  and then without more ado hegot the key and opened the table drawer for us himself</s> we found inside several letters and a large book with a lock to ithaving the words my diary inscribed on it in gilt letters</s>  as a matterof course we took possession of the letters and the diary and sealedthem up to be given to the fiscal</s>  at the same time the gentleman wroteout a protest on the prisoners behalf and handed us his card</s>  thecard informed us that he was mr</s>  playmore now one of the agents forthe prisoner</s>  the card and the protest were deposited with the

fact thatmy husband himself had actually purchased the arsenic in both casesremained unshaken</s> the next witnessesthe gardener and the cook at gleninchwound thechain of hostile evidence around the

the poison was traced directly to my husband and to noone else</s>  that he had bought it was actually proved and that he hadkept it was the one conclusion that the evidence justified</s> the witnesses who came next did their best to press the charge againstthe prisoner home to him</s>  having the arsenic in his possession whathad he done with it</s>  the evidence led the jury to infer what he had donewith it</s> the prisoners valet deposed that his master had rung for him at twentyminutes to ten on the morning of the day on which his mistress died andhad ordered a cup of tea for her</s>  the man had received the order at theopen door of mrs</s>  macallans room and could positively swear that noother person but his master was there at the time</s> the underhousemaid appearing

answeredno</s> the dean of faculty persisteddid you ever hear mrs</s>  macallan speak of arsenic taken as a wash ortaken as a medicine as a good thing to improve the complexion</s>  thewitness answered never</s> similar questions were next put to the nurse and were all answered bythis witness also in the negative</s> here then in spite of the negative answers was the plan of thedefense made

prisoners declaration before the sheriff expresslysets forth that he purchased the arsenic at the request of his wife</s> the lord justice clerk inquired upon this if there were any objection onthe

womenso far as i know in a perfectly innocent way</s>  that hecould prefer mrs</s>  beauly to his wife is inconceivable to me unless hewere out of his senses</s>  i never had any reason to believe that he wasout of his senses</s> as to the question of the arsenici mean the question of tracing thatpoison to the possession of mrs</s>  eustace macallani am able to giveevidence which may perhaps be worthy of the attention of the court</s> i was present in the fiscals office during the examination ofthe papers and of the other objects discovered at gleninch</s>  thedressingcase belonging to the deceased lady was shown to me afterits contents had been officially investigated by the fiscal himself</s>  ihappen to have a very sensitive sense of touch</s>  in handling the lid ofthe dressingcase on the inner side i felt something at a certainplace which induced me to examine the whole structure of the lidvery carefully</s>  the result was the discovery of a private repositoryconcealed in the space between the outer wood and the lining</s>  in thatrepository i found the bottle which i now produce</s> the further examination of the witness was suspended while thehidden bottle was compared with the bottles properly belonging to thedressingcase</s> these last were of the finest cut glass and of a very elegantformentirely unlike the bottle found in the private repository whichwas of the commonest manufacture and of the shape ordinarily in useamong chemists</s>  not a drop of liquid not the smallest atom of anysolid substance remained in it</s>  no smell exhaled from itand moreunfortunately still for the interests of the defense no label was foundattached to the bottle when it had been discovered</s> the chemist who had sold the second supply of arsenic to the prisonerwas recalled and examined</s>  he declared that the bottle was exactly likethe bottle in which he had placed the arsenic</s>  it was however equallylike hundreds of other bottles in his shop</s>  in the absence of the labelon which he had himself written the word poison it was impossiblefor him to identify the bottle</s>  the dressingcase and the deceasedladys bedroom had been vainly searched for the chemists missinglabelon the chance that it might have become accidentally detachedfrom the mysterious empty bottle</s>  in both instances the search had beenwithout result</s>  morally it was a fair conclusion that this might bereally the bottle which had contained the poison</s>  legally there was notthe slightest proof of it</s> thus ended the last effort of the defense to trace the arsenic purchasedby the prisoner to the possession of his wife</s>  the book relating thepractices of the styrian peasantry found in the deceased ladys roomhad been produced but could the book prove that she had asked herhusband to buy arsenic for her</s>  the crumpled paper with the grainsof powder left in it had been identified by the chemist and had beendeclared to contain grains of arsenic</s>  but where was the proof that mrs</s> eustace macallans hand had placed the packet in the cabinet and hademptied it of its contents</s>  no direct evidence anywhere</s>  nothing butconjecture</s> the renewed examination of miserrimus dexter touched on matters of nogeneral interest</s>  the crossexamination resolved itself in substanceinto a mental trial of strength between the witness and the lordadvocate the struggle terminating according to the general opinionin favor of the witness</s>  one question and one answer only i will repeathere</s>  they appeared to me to be of serious importance to the object thati had in view in reading the trial</s> i believe mr</s>  dexter the lord advocate remarked in his mostironical manner that you have a theory of your own which makes thedeath of mrs</s>  eustace macallan no mystery to you</s> i may have my own ideas on that subject as on other subjects thewitness replied</s>  but let me ask their lordships the judges am i hereto declare theories or to state facts</s> i made a note of that answer</s>  mr</s>  dexters ideas were the ideas ofa true friend to my husband and of a man of far more than averageability</s>  they might be of inestimable value to me in the coming timeifi could prevail on him to communicate them</s> i may mention while i am writing on the subject that i added to thisfirst note a second containing an observation of my own</s>  in alluding tomrs</s>  beauly while he was giving his evidence mr</s>  dexter had spoken ofher so slightinglyso rudely i might almost sayas to suggest he hadsome strong private reasons for disliking perhaps for distrustingthis lady</s>  here again it might be of vital importance to me to see mr</s> dexter and to clear up if i could what the dignity of the court hadpassed over without notice</s> the last witness had been now examined</s>  the chair on wheels glided awaywith the halfman in it and was lost in a distant corner of the court</s> the lord advocate rose to address the jury for the prosecution</s> i do not scruple to say that i never read anything so infamous as thisgreat lawyers speech</s>  he was not ashamed to declare at starting thathe firmly believed the prisoner to be guilty</s>  what right had he to sayanything of the sort</s>  was it for him to decide</s>  was he the judgeand jury both i should like to know</s>  having begun by condemning theprisoner on his own authority the lord advocate proceeded to pervertthe most innocent actions of that unhappy man so as to give them asvile an aspect as possible</s>  thus when eustace kissed his poor wifesforehead on her deathbed he did it to create a favorable impression inthe minds of the doctor and the nurse</s>  again when his grief under hisbereavement completely overwhelmed him he was triumphing in secretand acting a part</s>  if you looked into his heart you would see therea diabolical hatred for his wife and an infatuated passion for mrs</s> beauly</s>  in everything he had said he had lied in everything he had donehe had acted like a crafty and heartless wretch</s>  so the chief counselfor the prosecution spoke of the prisoner standing helpless before himat the bar</s>  in my husbands place if i could have done nothing morei would have thrown something at his head</s>  as it was i tore the pageswhich contained the speech for the prosecution out of the report andtrampled them under my feetand felt all the better too for having doneit</s>  at the same time i feel a little ashamed of having revenged myselfon the harmless printed leaves now</s> the fifth day of the trial opened with the speech for the defense</s>  ahwhat a contrast to the infamies uttered by the lord advocate wasthe grand burst of eloquence by the dean of faculty speaking on myhusbands side</s> this illustrious lawyer struck the right note at starting</s> i yield to no one he began in the pity i feel for the wife</s>  buti say the martyr in this case from first to last is the husband</s> whatever the poor woman may have endured that unhappy man at the barhas suffered and is now suffering more</s>  if he had not been the kindestof men the most docile and most devoted of husbands he would neverhave occupied his present dreadful situation</s>  a man of a meaner andharder nature would have felt suspicions of his wifes motives whenshe asked him to buy poisonwould have seen through the wretchedlycommonplace excuses she made for wanting itand would have wisely andcruelly said no</s>  the prisoner is not that sort of man</s>  he is too goodto his wife too innocent of any evil thought toward her or toward anyone to foresee the inconveniences and the dangers to which his fatalcompliance may expose him</s>  and what is the result</s>  he stands therebranded as a murderer because he was too highminded and too honorableto suspect his wife</s> speaking thus of the husband the dean was just as eloquent and just asunanswerable when he came to speak of the wife</s> the lord advocate he said has asked with the bitter irony forwhich he is celebrated at the scottish bar why we have failed entirelyto prove that the prisoner placed the two packets of poison in thepossession of his wife</s>  i say in answer we have proved first thatthe wife was passionately attached to the husband secondly that shefelt bitterly the defects in her personal appearance and especiallythe defects in her complexion and thirdly that she was informed ofarsenic as a supposed remedy for those defects taken internally</s>  tomen who know anything of human nature there is proof enough</s>  doesmy learned friend actually suppose that women are in the habit ofmentioning the secret artifices and applications by which they improvetheir personal appearance</s>  is it in his experience of the sex that awoman who is eagerly bent on making herself attractive to a man wouldtell that man or tell anybody else who might communicate with him thatthe charm by which she hoped to win his heartsay the charm of a prettycomplexionhad been artificially acquired by the perilous use of adeadly poison</s>  the bare idea of such a thing is absurd</s>  of course nobodyever heard mrs</s>  eustace macallan speak of arsenic</s>  of course nobody eversurprised her in the act of taking arsenic</s>  it is in the evidencethat she would not even confide her intention to try the poison to thefriends who had told her of it as a remedy and who had got her thebook</s>  she actually begged them to consider their brief conversation onthe subject as strictly private</s>  from first to last poor creature shekept her secret just as she would have kept her secret if she had wornfalse hair or if she had been indebted to the dentist for her teeth</s> and there you see her husband in peril of his life because a womanacted like a womanas your wives gentlemen of the jury would in asimilar position act toward you</s> after such glorious oratory as this i wish i had room to quote more ofit</s>  the next and last speech delivered at the trialthat is to saythe charge of the judge to the juryis dreary reading indeed</s> his lordship first told the jury that they could not expect to havedirect evidence of the poisoning</s>  such evidence hardly ever occurred incases of poisoning</s>  they must be satisfied with the best circumstantialevidence</s>  all quite true i dare say</s>  but having told the jury theymight accept circumstantial evidence he turned back again on his ownwords and warned them against being too ready to trust it</s>  you musthave evidence satisfactory and convincing to your own minds he saidin which you find no conjecturesbut only irresistible and justinferences</s>  who is to decide what is a just inference</s>  and what iscircumstantial evidence but conjecture</s> after this specimen i need give no further extracts from the summingup</s>  the jury thoroughly bewildered no doubt took refuge in acompromise</s>  they occupied an hour in considering and debating amongthemselves in their own room</s>  a jury of women would not have takena minute</s>  then they returned into court and gave their timid andtrimming scotch verdict in these wordsnot proven</s> some slight applause followed among the audience which was instantlychecked</s>  the prisoner was dismissed from the bar</s>  he slowly retiredlike a man in deep grief his head sunk on his breastnot looking atany one and not replying when his friends spoke to him</s>  he knew poorfellow the slur that the verdict left on him</s>  we dont say you areinnocent of the crime charged against you we only say there is notevidence enough to convict you</s>  in that lame and impotent conclusionthe proceedings ended at the time</s>  and there they would have remainedfor all timebut for me</s>

wish after my long hoursof reading and thinking to lie down and sleep</s>  it was strange but itwas so</s>  i felt as if i had slept and had now just awakeneda newwoman with a new mind</s> i could now at last understand eustaces desertion of me</s>  to a man ofhis refinement it would have been a martyrdom to meet his wife after shehad read the things published of him to all the world in the report</s>  ifelt that as he would have felt it</s>  at the same time i thought he mighthave trusted me to make amends to him for the martyrdom and mighthave come back</s>  perhaps it might yet end in his coming back</s>  in themeanwhile and in that expectation i pitied and forgave him with mywhole heart</s> one little matter only dwelt on my mind disagreeably in spite ofmy philosophy</s>  did

confide to a stranger a suspicionroused in me by the trial which i have been thus far afraid to mentioneven in these pages</s> it must nevertheless be mentioned now</s>  my suspicion led to resultswhich are part of my story and part of my life</s> let me own then to begin with that i closed the record of the trialactually agreeing in one important particular with the opinion of myenemy

discern thesmallest fragment of probability</s>  without going quite so far as thisi too could see no reason whatever in the evidence for assumingthat the poor woman had taken an overdose of the poison by mistake</s>  ibelieved that she had the arsenic secretly in her possession and thatshe had tried or intended to try the use of it internally for thepurpose of improving her complexion</s>  but further than this i couldnot advance</s>  the more i thought of it the more plainly justified thelawyers for the prosecution seemed to me to be in declaring that mrs</s> eustace macallan had died by the hand of a poisoneralthough they wereentirely and certainly mistaken in charging my husband with the crime</s> my husband being innocent somebody else on my own showing must beguilty</s>  who among the persons inhabiting the house at the time hadpoisoned mrs</s>  eustace macallan</s>  my suspicion in answering that questionpointed straight to a woman</s>  and the name of that woman

me that the works on thewalls were the production of the allaccomplished dexter himself</s>  notsatisfied with being poet and composer he was painter as well</s>  on onewall the subjects were

man also in fancy costume stood astride overthe dead body with his sword lifted to the lowering sky and watchedwith a horrid expression of delight the blood of the man whom he hadjust killed dripping slowly in a procession of big red drops down thebroad blade of his weapon</s>  the next picture illustrated cruelty in manycompartments</s>  in one i saw a disemboweled horse savagely spurred onby his rider at a bullfight</s>  in another an aged philosopher wasdissecting a living cat and gloating over his work</s>  in a third twopagans politely congratulated each other on the torture of two

something that i accidentally saidreminded eustace of our last interview at major fitzdavids house</s> he referred very delicately to what i had then said of the verdictpronounced on him at the trial

from thecarpet and the cinders and ashes were taken out of the grate and thewhole of it was in the bucket when her attention was recalled to thechildren by hearing one of them cry</s> she looked about the room without at first discovering them</s> a fresh outburst of crying led her in the right direction and showedher the children under a table in a corner of the room</s>  the youngest ofthe two had got into a wastepaper basket</s>  the eldest had found an oldbottle of gum with a brush fixed in the cork and was gravely paintingthe face of the smaller child with what little remained of the

afterthe mistakes i made when you consulted me in edinburgh</s>  events i admithave proved that i was entirely wrong in trying to prevent you fromreturning to dexterand partially wrong in suspecting dexter of beingdirectly instead of indirectly answerable for the first mrs</s>  eustacesdeath</s>  i frankly make my confession and leave you to tell mr</s>  benjaminwhether you think my new catechism worthy of examination or not</s> i thought his new catechism as he called it decidedly worthy ofexamination</s>  if you dont ag ree with this view and if you are dyingto be done with me and my narrative pass on to the next chapter by allmeans</s> benjamin produced the questions and answers and read them to me at myrequest in these termsquestions suggested by the letter discovered at gleninch</s>  first groupquestions relating to the diary</s>  first question obtaining access to mr</s> macallans private journal was miserrimus dexter guided by any previousknowledge of its contents</s> answer it is doubtful if he had any such knowledge</s>  the probabilitiesare that he noticed how carefully mr</s>  macallan secured his diary fromobservation that he inferred therefrom the existence of dangerousdomestic secrets in the lockedup pages and that he speculated on usingthose secrets for his own purpose when he caused the false keys to bemade</s> second question to what motive are we to attribute miserrimus dextersinterference with the sheriffs officers on the day when they seizedmr</s>  macallans diary along with his other papers</s> answer in replying to this question we must first do justice todexter himself</s>  infamously as we now know him to have acted the manwas not a downright fiend</s>  that he secretly hated mr</s>  macallan as hissuccessful rival in the affections of the woman he lovedand that hedid all he could to induce the unhappy lady to desert her husbandarein this case facts not to be denied</s>  on the other hand it is fairly tobe doubted whether he were additionally capable of permitting the friendwho trusted him to be tried for murder through his fault withoutmaking an effort to save the innocent man</s>  it had naturally neveroccurred to mr</s>  macallan being guiltless of his wifes death todestroy his diary and his letters in the fear that they might be usedagainst him</s>  until the prompt and secret action of the fiscal took himby surprise the idea of his being charged with the murder of hiswife was an idea which we know from his own statement had never evenentered his mind</s>  but dexter must have looked at the matter from anotherpoint of view</s>  in his last wandering words spoken when his mind brokedown he refers to the diary in these terms the diary will hang himi wont have him hanged</s>  if he could have found his opportunity ofgetting at it in timeor if the sheriffs officers had not been tooquick for himthere can be no reasonable doubt that dexter wouldhave himself destroyed the diary foreseeing the consequences of itsproduction in court</s>  so strongly does he appear to have felt theseconsiderations that he even resisted the officers in the execution oftheir duty</s>  his agitation when he sent for mr</s>  playmore to interferewas witnessed by that gentleman and it may not be amiss to add wasgenuine agitation beyond dispute</s> questions of the second group relating to the wifes confession</s>  firstquestion what prevented dexter from destroying the letter when hefirst discovered it under the dead womans pillow</s> answer the same motives which led him to resist the seizure of thediary and to give his evidence in the prisoners favor at the trialinduced him to preserve the letter until the verdict was known</s>  lookingback once more at his last words as taken down by mr</s>  benjamin we mayinfer that if the verdict had been guilty he would not have hesitatedto save the innocent husband by producing the wifes confession</s>  thereare degrees in all wickedness</s>  dexter was wicked enough to suppressthe letter which wounded his vanity by revealing him as an object forloathing and contemptbut he was not wicked enough deliberately to letan innocent man perish on the scaffold</s>  he was capable of exposing therival whom he hated to the infamy and torture of a public accusation ofmurder but in the event of an adverse verdict he shrank before thedirer cruelty of letting him be hanged</s>  reflect in this connection onwhat he must have suffered villain as he was when he first read thewifes confession</s>  he had calculated on undermining her affection forher husbandand whither had his calculations led him</s>  he had driventhe woman whom he loved to the last dreadful refuge of death by suicide</s> give these considerations their due weight and you will understand thatsome little redeeming virtue might show itself as the result even ofthis mans remorse</s> second question what motive influenced miserrimus dexters conductwhen mrs</s>  valeria macallan informed him that she proposed reopeningthe inquiry into the poisoning at gleninch</s> answer in all probability dexters guilty fears suggested to him thathe might have been watched on the morning when he secretly entered thechamber in which the first mrs</s>  eustace lay dead</s>  feeling no scrupleshimself to restrain him from listening at doors and looking throughkeyholes he would be all the more ready to suspect other people of thesame practices</s>  with this dread in him it would naturally occur to hismind that mrs</s>  valeria might meet with the person who had watched himand might hear all that the person had discoveredunless he led herastray at the outset of her investigations</s>  her own jealous suspicionsof mrs</s>  beauly offered him the chance of easily doing this</s>  and he wasall the readier to profit by the chance being himself animated by themost hostile feeling toward that lady</s>  he knew her as the enemy whodestroyed the domestic peace of the mistress of the house he lovedthe mistress of the houseand he hated her enemy accordingly</s>  thepreservation of his guilty secret and the persecution of mrs</s>  beaulythere you have the greater and the lesser motive of his conduct in hisrelations with mrs</s>  eustace the second</s>  note by the writer of the narrativelook back for a further illustration of this point of view to thescene at benjamins house chapter xxxv</s>  where dexter in a moment ofungovernable agitation betrays his own secret to valeria</s> benjamin laid down his notes and took off his spectacles</s> we have not thought it necessary to go further than this he said</s>  isthere any point you can think of that is still left unexplained</s> i reflected</s>  there was no point of any importance left unexplained thati could remember</s>  but there was one little matter suggested by therecent allusions to mrs</s>  beauly which i wished if possible to havethoroughly cleared up</s> have you and mr</s>  playmore ever spoken together on the subject of myhusbands former attachment to mrs</s>  beauly</s>  i asked</s>  has mr</s>  playmoreever told you why eustace did not marry her after the trial</s> i put that question to mr</s>  playmore myself said benjamin</s>  heanswered it easily enough</s>  being your husbands confidential friend andadviser he was consulted when mr</s>  eustace wrote to mrs</s>  beauly afterthe trial and he repeated the substance of the letter at my request</s> would you like to hear what i remember of it in my turn</s> i owned that i should like to hear it</s>  what benjamin thereupon told meexactly coincided with what miserrimus dexter had told meas related inthe thirtieth chapter of my narrative</s>  mrs</s>  beauly had been a witnessof the public degradation of my husband</s>  that was enough in itself toprevent him from marrying her he broke off with her for the samereason which had led him to separate himself from me</s>  existence with awoman who knew that he had been tried for his life as a murderer was anexistence which he had not resolution enough to face</s>  the two accountsagreed in every particular</s>  at last my jealous curiosity was pacifiedand benjamin was free to dismiss the past from further considerationand to approach the more critical and more interesting topic of thefuture</s> his first inquiries related to eustace</s>  he asked if my husband had anysuspicion of the proceedings which had taken place at gleninch</s> i told him what had happened and how i had contrived to put off theinevitable disclosure for a time</s> my old friends face cleared up as he listened to me</s> this will be good news for mr</s>  playmore he said</s>  our excellentfriend the lawyer is sorely afraid that our discoveries maycompromise your position with your husband</s>  on the one hand he isnaturally anxious to spare mr</s>  eustace the distress which he mustcertainly feel if he read his first wifes confession</s>  on the otherhand it is impossible in justice as mr</s>  playmore puts it tothe unborn children of your marriage to suppress a document whichvindicates the memory of their father from the aspersion that the scotchverdict might otherwise cast on it</s> i listened attentively</s>  benjamin had touched on a trouble which wasstill secretly preying on my mind</s> how does mr</s>  playmore propose to meet the difficulty</s>  i asked</s> he can only meet it in one way benjamin replied</s>  he proposes toseal up the original manuscript of the letter and to add to it a plainstatement of the circumstances under which it was discovered supportedby your signed attestation and mine as witnesses to the fact</s>  thisdone he must leave it to you to take your husband into your confidenceat your own time</s>  it will then be for mr</s>  eustace to decide whetherhe will open the inclosureor whether he will leave it with the sealunbroken as an heirloom to his children to be made public or not attheir discretion when they are of an age to think for themselves</s>  doyou consent to this my dear</s>  or would you prefer that mr</s>  playmoreshould see your husband and act for you in the matter</s> i decided without hesitation to take the responsibility on myself</s> where the question of guiding eustaces decision was concerned iconsidered my influence to be decidedly superior to the influence of mr</s> playmore</s>  my choice met with benjamins full approval</s>  he arranged towrite to edinburgh and relieve the lawyers anxieties by that dayspost</s> the one last thing now left to be settled related to our plans forreturning to england</s>  the doctors were the authorities on this subject</s> i promised to consult them about it at their next visit to eustace</s> have you anything more to say to me</s>  benjamin inquired as he openedhis writingcase</s> i thought of miserrimus dexter and ariel and i inquired if he had heardany news of them lately</s>  my old friend sighed and warned me that i hadtouched on a painful subject</s> the best thing that can happen to that unhappy man is likely tohappen he said</s>  the one change in him is a change that threatensparalysis</s>  you may hear of his death before you get back to england</s> and ariel</s>  i asked</s> quite unaltered benjamin answered</s>  perfectly happy so long as sheis with the master</s>  from all i can hear of her poor soul she doesntreckon dexter among moral beings</s>  she laughs at the idea of his dyingand she waits patiently in the firm persuasion that he will recognizeher again</s> benjamins news saddened and silenced me</s>  i left him to his letter</s> chapter l</s> the last of the story</s> in ten days more we returned to england accompanied by benjamin</s> mrs</s>  macallans house in london offered us ample accommodation</s>  wegladly availed ourselves of her proposal when she invited us to staywith her until our child was born and our plans for the future werearranged</s> the sad news from the asylum for which benjamin had prepared my mind atparis reached me soon after our return to england</s>  miserrimus dextersrelease from the burden of life had come to him by slow degrees</s>  a fewhours before he breathed his last he rallied for a while and recognizedariel at his bedside</s>  he feebly pronounced her name and looked at herand asked for me</s>  they thought of sending for me but it was too late</s> before the messenger could be dispatched he said with a touch of hisold selfimportance silence all of you</s>  my brains are weary i amgoing to sleep</s>  he closed his eyes in slumber and never awoke again</s> so for this man too the end came mercifully without grief or pain</s>  sothat strange and manysided lifewith

masterwhat more could she donow the master was gone</s>  she could die for him</s> they had mercifully allowed her to attend the funeral of miserrimusdexterin the hope that the ceremony might avail to convince her of hisdeath</s>  the anticipation was not realized she still persisted in denyingthat the master had left her</s>  they were obliged to restrain the poorcreature by force when the coffin was lowered into the grave and theycould only remove her from the cemetery by the same means when theburialservice was over</s>  from that time her life alternated for afew weeks between fits of raving delirium and intervals of lethargicrepose</s>  at the annual ball given in the asylum when the strictsuperintendence of the patients was in some degree relaxed the alarmwas raised a little before midnight that ariel was missing</s>  the nursein charge had left her asleep and had yielded to the temptation ofgoing downstairs to look at the dancing</s>  when the woman returned toher post

 from that time i heard little or nothing of the major andi am ashamed to say i had almost entirely forgotten himwhen iwas reminded of the modern don juan by the amazing appearance ofweddingcards
