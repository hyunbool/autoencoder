this slightlybuilt romance was the outcome of a wish to set theemotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the stupendousbackground of the stellar universe and to impart to readers thesentiment that of these contrasting magnitudes the smaller might be thegreater to them as men</s> but on the publication of the book people seemed to be less struck withthese high aims of the author than with their own opinion first thatthe novel was an improper one in its morals and secondly that it wasintended to be a satire on the established church of this country</s>  i wasmade to suffer in consequence from several eminent pens</s> that however was thirteen years ago and in respect of the firstopinion i venture to think that those who care to read the story nowwill be quite astonished at the scrupulous propriety observed therein onthe relations of the sexes for though there may be frivolous and evengrotesque touches on occasion there is hardly a single caress in thebook outside legal matrimony or what was intended so to be</s> as for the second opinion it is sufficient to draw attention as i didat the time to the fact that the bishop is every inch a gentleman andthat the parish priest who figures in the narrative is one of its mostestimable characters</s> however the pages must speak for themselves</s>  some few readers itrustto take a serious viewwill be reminded by this imperfect storyin a manner not unprofitable to the growth of the social sympathies ofthe pathos misery longsuffering and divine tenderness which in reallife frequently accompany the passion of such a woman as viviette for alover several years her junior</s> the scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the part ofthe country specified each of which has a column standing upon it</s> certain surrounding peculiarities have been imported into the narrativefrom both sites</s> t</s>  h</s> july 1895</s> two on a tower</s> ion an early winter afternoon clear but not cold when the vegetableworld was a weird multitude of skeletons through whose ribs the sun shonefreely a gleaming landau came to a pause on the crest of a hill inwessex</s>  the spot was where the old melchester road which the carriagehad hitherto followed was joined by a drive that led round into a parkat no great distance off</s> the footman alighted and went to the occupant of the carriage a ladyabout eight or nineandtwenty</s>  she was looking through the openingafforded by a fieldgate at the undulating stretch of country beyond</s>  inpursuance of some remark from her the servant looked in the samedirection</s> the central feature of the middle distance as they beheld it was acircular isolated hill of no great elevation which placed itself instrong chromatic contrast with a wide acreage of surrounding arable bybeing covered with firtrees</s>  the trees were all of one size and age sothat their tips assumed the precise curve of the hill they grew upon</s> this pineclad protuberance was yet further marked out from the generallandscape by having on its summit a tower in the form of a classicalcolumn which though partly immersed in the plantation rose above thetreetops to a considerable height</s>  upon this object the eyes of ladyand servant were bent</s> then there is no road leading near it</s>  she asked</s> nothing nearer than where we are now my lady</s> then drive home she said after a moment</s>  and the carriage rolled onits way</s> a few days later the same lady in the same carriage passed that spotagain</s>  her eyes as before turned to the distant tower</s> nobbs she said to the coachman could you find your way home throughthat field so as to get near the outskirts of the plantation where thecolumn is</s> the coachman regarded the field</s>  well my lady he observed in dryweather we might drive in there by inching and pinching and so getacross by fiveandtwenty acres all being well</s>  but the ground is soheavy after these rains that perhaps it would hardly be safe to try itnow</s> perhaps not she assented indifferently</s>  remember it will you at adrier time</s> and again the carriage sped along the road the ladys eyes resting onthe segmental hill the blue trees that muffled it and the column thatformed its apex till they were out of sight</s> a long time elapsed before that lady drove over the hill again</s>  it wasfebruary the soil was now unquestionably dry the weather and scenebeing in other respects much as they had been before</s>  the familiar shapeof the column seemed to remind her that at last an opportunity for aclose inspection had arrived</s>  giving her directions she saw the gateopened and after a little manoeuvring the carriage swayed slowly intothe uneven field</s> although the pillar stood upon the hereditary estate of her husband thelady had never visited it owing to its insulation by this wellnighimpracticable ground</s>  the drive to the base of the hill was tedious andjerky and on reaching it she alighted directing that the carriageshould be driven back empty over the clods to wait for her on thenearest edge of the field</s>  she then ascended beneath the trees on foot</s> the column now showed itself as a much more important erection than ithad appeared from the road or the park or the windows of welland househer residence hard by whence she had surveyed it hundreds of timeswithout ever feeling a sufficient interest in its details to investigatethem</s>  the column had been erected in the last century as a substantialmemorial of her husbands greatgrandfather a respectable officer whohad fallen in the american war and the reason of her lack of interestwas partly owing to her relations with this husband of which more anon</s> it was little beyond the sheer desire for something to dothe chronicdesire of her curiously lonely lifethat had brought her here now</s>  shewas in a mood to welcome anything that would in some measure disperse analmost killing ennui</s>  she would have welcomed even a misfortune</s>  shehad heard that from the summit of the pillar four counties could be seen</s> whatever pleasurable effect was to be derived from looking into fourcounties she resolved to enjoy today</s> the firshrouded hilltop was according to some antiquaries an oldroman campif it were not as others insisted an old british castleor as the rest swore an old saxon field of witenagemotewith remainsof an outer and an inner vallum a winding path leading up between theiroverlapping ends by an easy ascent</s>  the spikelets from the trees formeda soft carpet over the route and occasionally a brake of brambles barredthe interspaces of the trunks</s>  soon she stood immediately at the foot ofthe column</s> it had been built in the tuscan order of classic architecture and wasreally a tower being hollow with steps inside</s>  the gloom and solitudewhich prevailed round the base were remarkable</s>  the sob of theenvironing trees was here expressively manifest and moved by the lightbreeze their thin straight stems rocked in seconds like invertedpendulums while some boughs and twigs rubbed the pillars sides oroccasionally clicked in catching each other</s>  below the level of theirsummits the masonry was lichenstained and mildewed for the sun neverpierced that moaning cloud of blueblack vegetation</s>  pads of moss grewin the joints of the stonework and here and there shadeloving insectshad engraved on the mortar patterns of no human style or meaning butcurious and suggestive</s>  above the trees the case was different thepillar rose into the sky a bright and cheerful thing unimpeded cleanand flushed with the sunlight</s> the spot was seldom visited by a pedestrian except perhaps in theshooting season</s>  the rarity of human intrusion was evidenced by themazes of rabbitruns the feathers of shy birds the exuvi of reptilesas also by the wellworn paths of squirrels down the sides of trunks andthence horizontally away</s>  the fact of the plantation being an island inthe midst of an arable plain sufficiently accounted for this lack ofvisitors</s>  few unaccustomed to such places can be aware of the insulatingeffect of ploughed ground when no necessity compels people to traverseit</s>  this rotund hill of trees and brambles standing in the centre of aploughed field of some ninety or a hundred acres was probably visitedless frequently than a rock would have been visited in a lake of equalextent</s> she walked round the column to the other side where she found the doorthrough which the interior was reached</s>  the paint if it had ever hadany was all washed from the wood and down the decaying surface of theboards liquid rust from the nails and hinges had run in red stains</s>  overthe door was a stone tablet bearing apparently letters or words butthe inscription whatever it was had been smoothed over with a plasterof lichen</s> here stood this aspiring piece of masonry erected as the mostconspicuous and ineffaceable reminder of a man that could be thought ofand yet the whole aspect of the memorial betokened forgetfulness</s> probably not a dozen people within the district knew the name of theperson commemorated while perhaps not a soul remembered whether thecolumn were hollow or solid whether with or without a tablet explainingits date and purpose</s>  she herself had lived within a mile of it for thelast five years and had never come near it till now</s> she hesitated to ascend alone but finding that the door was not fastenedshe pushed it open with her foot and entered</s>  a scrap of writingpaperlay within and arrested her attention by its freshness</s>  some humanbeing then knew the spot despite her surmises</s>  but as the paper hadnothing on it no clue was afforded yet feeling herself the proprietor ofthe column and of all around it her selfassertiveness was sufficient tolead her on</s>  the staircase was lighted by slits in the wall and therewas no difficulty in reaching the top the steps being quite unworn</s>  thetrapdoor leading on to the roof was open and on looking through it aninteresting spectacle met her eye</s> a youth was sitting on a stool in the centre of the lead flat whichformed the summit of the column his eye being applied to the end of alarge telescope that stood before him on a tripod</s>  this sort of presencewas unexpected and the lady started back into the shade of the opening</s> the only effect produced upon him by her footfall was an impatient waveof the hand which he did without removing his eye from the instrumentas if to forbid her to interrupt him</s> pausing where she stood the lady examined the aspect of the individualwho thus made himself so completely at home on a building which shedeemed her unquestioned property</s>  he was a youth who might properly havebeen characterized by a word the judicious chronicler would not readilyuse in such a connexion preferring to reserve it for raising images ofthe opposite sex</s>  whether because no deep felicity is likely to arisefrom the condition or from any other reason to say in these days that ayouth is beautiful is not to award him that amount of credit which theexpression would have carried with it if he had lived in the times of theclassical dictionary</s>  so much indeed is the reverse the case that theassertion creates an awkwardness in saying anything more about him</s>  thebeautiful youth usually verges so perilously on the incipient coxcombwho is about to become the lothario or juan among the neighbouringmaidens that for the due understanding of our present young man hissublime innocence of any thought concerning his own material aspect orthat of others is most fervently asserted and must be as ferventlybelieved</s> such as he was there the lad sat</s>  the sun shone full in his face andon his head he wore a black velvet skullcap leaving to view below it acurly margin of very light shining hair which accorded well with theflush upon his cheek</s> he had such a complexion as that with which raffaelle enriches thecountenance of the youthful son of zachariasa complexion which thoughclear is far enough removed from virgin delicacy and suggests plenty ofsun and wind as its accompaniment</s>  his features were sufficientlystraight in the contours to correct the beholders first impression thatthe head was the head of a girl</s>  beside him stood a little oak tableand in front was the telescope</s> his visitor had ample time to make these observations and she may havedone so all the more keenly through being herself of a totally oppositetype</s>  her hair was black as midnight her eyes had no less deep a shadeand her complexion showed the richness demanded as a support to thesedecided features</s>  as she continued to look at the pretty fellow beforeher apparently so far abstracted into some speculative world as scarcelyto know a real one a warmer wave of her warm temperament glowed visiblythrough her and a qualified observer might from this have hazarded aguess that there was romance blood in her veins</s> but even the interest attaching to the youth could not arrest herattention for ever and as he made no further signs of moving his eyefrom the instrument she broke the silence withwhat do you see</s> something happening somewhere</s> yes quite a catastrophe</s>  he automatically murmured without movinground</s>
what</s> a cyclone in the sun</s>
the lady paused as if to consider the weight of that event in the scaleof terrene life</s> will it make any difference to us here</s>  she asked</s> the young man by this time seemed to be awakened to the consciousnessthat somebody unusual was talking to him he turned and started</s> i beg your pardon he said</s>  i thought it was my relative come to lookafter me</s>  she often comes about this time</s> he continued to look at her and forget the sun just such a reciprocityof influence as might have been expected between a dark lady and a flaxenhaired youth making itself apparent in the faces of each</s> dont let me interrupt your observations said she</s> ah no said he again applying his eye whereupon his face lost theanimation which her presence had lent it and became immutable as that ofa bust though superadding to the serenity of repose the sensitiveness oflife</s>  the expression that settled on him was one of awe</s>  not unaptlymight it have been said that he was worshipping the sun</s>  among thevarious intensities of that worship which have prevailed since the firstintelligent being saw the luminary decline westward as the young man nowbeheld it doing his was not the weakest</s>  he was engaged in what may becalled a very chastened or schooled form of that first and most naturalof adorations</s> but would you like to see it</s>  he recommenced</s>  it is an event that iswitnessed only about once in two or three years though it may occuroften enough</s> she assented and looked through the shaded eyepiece and saw a whirlingmass in the centre of which the blazing globe seemed to be laid bare toits core</s>  it was a peep into a maelstrom of fire taking place wherenobody had ever been or ever would be</s> it is the strangest thing i ever beheld she said</s>  then he lookedagain till wondering who her companion could be she asked are youoften here</s> every night when it is not cloudy and often in the day</s> ah night of course</s>  the heavens must be beautiful from this point</s> they are rather more than that</s> indeed</s>  have you entirely taken possession of this column</s> entirely</s> but it is my column she said with smiling asperity</s> then are you lady constantine wife of the absent sir blountconstantine</s> i am lady constantine</s> ah then i agree that it is your ladyships</s>  but will you allow me torent it of you for a time lady constantine</s> you have taken it whether i allow it or not</s>  however in the interestsof science it is advisable that you continue your tenancy</s>  nobody knowsyou are here i suppose</s> hardly anybody</s> he then took her down a few steps into the interior and showed her someingenious contrivances for stowing articles away</s> nobody ever comes near the columnor as its called here

just down there where i live now</s> he denoted by a nod a little dell lying immediately beyond the ploughedland which environed them</s> he kept it in his bureau and as the bureau descended to my grandfathermy mother and myself the key descended with it</s>  after the first thirtyor forty years nobody ever asked for it</s>  one day i saw it lying rustyin its niche and finding that it belonged to this column i took it andcame up</s>  i stayed here till it was dark and the stars came out andthat night i resolved to be an astronomer</s>  i came back here from schoolseveral months ago and i mean to be an astronomer still</s> he lowered his voice and addedi aim at nothing less than the dignity and office of astronomer royalif i live</s>  perhaps i shall not live</s> i dont see why you should suppose that said she</s>  how long are yougoing to make this your observatory</s> about a year longertill i have obtained a practical familiarity withthe heavens</s>  ah if i only had a good equatorial</s> what is that</s> a proper instrument for my pursuit</s>  but time is short and science isinfinitehow infinite only those who study astronomy fully realizeandperhaps i shall be worn out before i make my mark</s> she seemed to be greatly struck by the odd mixture in him of scientificearnestness and melancholy mistrust of all things human</s>  perhaps it wasowing to the nature of his studies</s> you are often on this tower alone at night</s>  she said</s> yes at this time of the year particularly and while there is no moon</s> i observe from seven or eight till about two in the morning with a viewto my great work on variable stars</s>  but with such a telescope asthiswell i must put up with it</s> can you see saturns ring and jupiters moons</s> he said drily that he could manage to do that not without some contemptfor the state of her knowledge</s> i have never seen any planet or star through a telescope</s> if you will come the first clear night lady constantine i will showyou any number</s>  i mean at your express wish not otherwise</s> i should like to come and possibly may at some time</s>  these stars thatvary so muchsometimes evening stars sometimes

satisfactory that i will not disturb itexcept at your serious request</s> but i wish to be enlightened</s> let me caution you against it</s> is enlightenment on the subject then so terrible</s> yes indeed</s> she laughingly declared that nothing could have so piqued her curiosityas his statement and turned to descend</s>  he helped her down the stairsand through the briers</s>  he would have gone further and crossed the opencornland with her but she preferred to go alone</s>  he then retraced hisway to the top of the column but instead of looking longer at the sunwatched her diminishing towards the distant fence behind which waitedthe carriage</s>  when in the midst of the field a dark spot on an area ofbrown there crossed her path a moving figure whom it was as difficultto

calling never having receivedany hint or permission to do so while lady constantines mysteriousmanner of leaving the parcel seemed to demand a like mysteriousness inhis approaches to her</s>  all the

epistles inspire thefollowing words from one who during life had never once addressed him dear nephewyou will doubtless experience some astonishment at receiving a communication from one whom you have never personally known and who when this comes into your hands will be beyond the reach of your knowledge</s>  perhaps i am the loser by this lifelong mutual ignorance</s>  perhaps i am much to blame for it perhaps not</s>  but such reflections are profitless at this date i have written with quite other views than to work up a sentimental regret on such an amazingly remote hypothesis as that the fact of a particular pair of people not meeting among the millions of other pairs of people who have never met is a great calamity either to the world in general or to themselves</s>  the occasion of my addressing you is briefly this nine months ago a report casually reached me that your scientific studies were pursued by you with great ability and that you were a young man of some promise as an astronomer</s>  my own scientific proclivities rendered the report more interesting than it might otherwise have been to me and it came upon me quite as a surprise that any issue of your fathers marriage should have so much in him or you might have seen more of me in former years than you are ever likely to do now</s>  my health had then begun to fail and i was starting for the cape or i should have come myself to inquire into your condition and prospects</s>  i did not return till six months later and as my health had not improved i sent a trusty friend to examine into your life pursuits and circumstances without your own knowledge and to report his observations to me</s>  this he did</s>  through him i learnt of favourable news 1 that you worked assiduously at the science of astronomy</s>  2 that everything was auspicious in the career you had chosen</s>  of unfavourable news 1 that the small income at your command even when eked out by the sum to which you would be entitled on your grandmothers death and the freehold of the homestead would be inadequate to support you becomingly as a scientific man whose lines of work were of a nature not calculated to produce emoluments for many years if ever</s>  2 that there was something in your path worse than narrow means and that that something was a woman</s>  to save you if possible from ruin on these heads i take the preventive measures detailed below</s>  the chief step is as my solicitor will have informed you that at the age of twentyfive the sum of 600 pounds a year be settled on you for life provided you have not married before reaching that agea yearly gift of an equal sum to be also provisionally made to you in the interimand vice versa that if you do marry before reaching the age of twentyfive you will receive nothing from the date of the marriage</s>  one object of my bequest is that you may have resources sufficient to enable you to travel and study the southern constellations</s>  when at the cape after hearing of your pursuits i was much struck with the importance of those constellations to an astronomer just pushing into notice</s>  there is more to be made of the southern hemisphere than ever has been made of it yet the mine is not so thoroughly worked as the northern and thither your studies should tend</s>  the only other preventive step in my power is that of exhortation at which i am not an adept</s>  nevertheless i say to you swithin st</s>  cleeve dont make a fool of yourself as your father did</s>  if your studies are to be worth anything believe me they must be carried on without the help of a woman</s>  avoid her and every one of the sex if you mean to achieve any worthy thing</s>  eschew all of that sort for many a year yet</s>  moreover i say the lady of your acquaintance avoid in particular</s>  i have heard nothing against her moral character hitherto i have no doubt it has been excellent</s>  she may have many good qualities both of heart and of mind</s>  but she has in addition to her original disqualification as a companion for you that is that of sex these two serious drawbacks she is much older than yourself much older</s>  said swithin resentfully</s>  and she is so impoverished that the title she derives from her late husband is a positive objection</s>  beyond this frankly i dont think well of her</s>  i dont think well of any woman who dotes upon a man younger than herself</s>  to care to be the first fancy of a young fellow like you shows no great common sense in her</s>  if she were worth her salt she would have too much pride to be intimate with a youth in your unassured position to say no worse</s>  she is old enough to know that a liaison with her may and almost certainly would be your ruin and on the other hand that a marriage would be preposterousunless she is a complete goose and in that case there is even more reason for avoiding her than if she were in her few senses</s>  a woman of honourable feeling nephew would be careful to do nothing to hinder you in your career as this putting of herself in your way most certainly will</s>  yet i hear that she professes a great anxiety on this same future of yours as a physicist</s>  the best way in which she can show the reality of her anxiety is by leaving you to yourself</s>  perhaps she persuades herself that she is doing you no harm</s>  well let her have the benefit of the possible belief but depend upon it that in truth she gives the lie to her conscience by maintaining such a transparent fallacy</s>  womens brains are not formed for assisting at any profound science they lack the power to see things except in the concrete</s>  shell blab your most secret plans and theories to every one of her acquaintance shes got none</s>  said swithin beginning to get warm</s>  and make them appear ridiculous by announcing them before they are matured</s>  if you attempt to study with a woman youll be ruled by her to entertain fancies instead of theories aircastles instead of intentions qualms instead of opinions sickly prepossessions instead of reasoned conclusions</s>  your wide heaven of study young man will soon reduce itself to the miserable narrow expanse of her face and your myriad of stars to her two trumpery eyes</s>
 a woman waking a young mans passions just at a moment when he is endeavouring to shine intellectually is doing little less than committing a crime</s>  like a certain philosopher i would upon my soul

hercardrecklessly impulsively ruinously perhaps but she had playedit it could not be withdrawn and she took this mornings luncheon as anepisode that could result in nothing to her beyond the

gratified affection lent to her manner just now asweet serenity a truly christian contentment which it puzzled thelearned bishop exceedingly to find in a warm young widow and increasedhis interest in

it depends lady constantine on whatyou understand by disappointing</s>  it may produce nothing visible to theworlds eye and yet may complete its development within to a veryperfect degree</s>  objective achievements though the only ones which arecounted are not the only ones that exist and have value and i for oneshould be sorry to assert that because a man of genius dies as unknownto the world as when he was born he therefore was an instance of wastedmaterial</s> objective achievements were however those that lady constantine had aweakness for in the present case and she asked her

tones dulymellowed by his position the minor clergy caught up the rays thereofand so the gentle influence played down the table</s> the company soon departed when luncheon was over and the remainder ofthe day passed in quietness the bishop being occupied in his room at thevicarage with writing letters or a sermon</s>  having a long journey beforehim the next day he had expressed a wish to be

crossed the churchyard and entered the vicaragedrawingroom at seven oclock his sister was not in his company</s>  shewas he said suffering from a slight headache and much regretted thatshe was on that account unable to come</s>  at this intelligence the socialsparkle disappeared from the bishops eye and he sat down to tableendeavouring to mould into the form of episcopal serenity an expressionwhich was really one of common human disappointment</s> in his simple statement louis glanville had by no means expressed all thecircumstances which accompanied his sisters refusal at the last momentto dine at her neighbours house</s>  louis had strongly urged her to bearup against her slight indispositionif it were that and notdisinclinationand come along with him on just this one occasionperhaps a more important episode in her life than she was aware of</s> viviette thereupon knew quite well that he alluded to the favourableimpression she was producing on the bishop notwithstanding that neitherof

soon became absorbedin the black mass of the fir plantation</s> meanwhile the conversation at mr</s>  torkinghams dinnertable was not of ahighly exhilarating quality</s>  the parson in long selfcommuning duringthe afternoon had decided that the diocesan synod whose annual sessionat melchester had occurred in the month previous would afford a solidand unimpeachable subject to launch during the meal wheneverconversation flagged and that it would be one likely to win the respectof his spiritual chieftain for himself as the introducer</s>  accordinglyin the further belief that you

and louiswaited patiently without looking sometimes into the night and sometimesthrough the door at the interlocutors and listening to their scientificconverse</s>  when all had been exhibited here below swithin lit hislantern and inviting his visitors to follow led the way up the columnexperiencing no small sense of relief as soon as he heard the footstepsof all three tramping on the stairs

thought that perhaps the long clamber up thestairs coming after a hard days work had taken his spontaneity out ofhim and mr</s>  torkingham was afraid that his lordship was getting bored</s> but this did not appear to be the case for though he said little hestayed on some time longer examining the construction of the dome afterrelinquishing the telescope while occasionally swithin caught the

before he had recoveredfrom his surprise the bishop had joined the others in the shades of theplantation</s> swithin immediately opened the door of the hut and scanned the nookbehind the bed</s>  as he had expected his bird had flown</s> xxviiall night the astronomers mind was on the stretch with curiosity as towhat the bishop could wish to say to him</s>  a dozen conjectures enteredhis brain to be abandoned in turn as unlikely</s>  that which finallyseemed the most plausible was that the bishop having become interestedin his pursuits and entertaining friendly recollections of his fatherwas going to ask if he could do anything to help him on in the professionhe had chosen</s>  should this be the case thought the suddenly sanguineyouth it would seem like an encouragement to that spirit of firmnesswhich had led him to reject his late uncles offer because it involvedthe renunciation of lady constantine</s> at last he fell asleep and when he awoke it was so late that the hourwas ready to solve what conjecture could not</s>  after a hurried breakfasthe paced across the fields entering the churchyard by the south gateprecisely at the appointed minute</s> the inclosure was well adapted

tombstone to await bishop helmsdales arrival</s> while he sat he fancied he could hear voices in conversation not far offand further attention convinced him that they came from ladyconstantines lawn

churchdoor he opened it entered and ascended to the ringers loft in thewest tower</s>  at the back of this was a window commanding a full view ofviviettes garden front</s> the flowers were all in

the churchyard many oftheir remarks entered the silence of the church tower through theventilator of the window</s> the conversation was general yet interesting enough to swithin</s>  atlength louis stepped upon the grass and picked up something that had lainthere which turned out to be a bowl throwing it forward he took asecond and bowled it towards the first or jack</s>  the bishop who seemedto be in a sprightly mood followed suit and bowled one in a curvetowards the jack turning and speaking to lady constantine as heconcluded the feat</s>  as she had not left the gravelled terrace he raisedhis voice so that the words reached swithin distinctly</s> do you follow us</s>  he asked gaily</s> i am not skilful she said</s>  i always bowl narrow</s> the bishop meditatively paused</s>

path underthe sunny wall of the aisle</s> their glances met and it was with some consternation that swithin beheldthe change that a few short minutes had wrought in that episcopalcountenance</s>  on the lawn with lady constantine the rays of an almostperpetual smile had brightened his dark aspect like flowers in a shadyplace now the smile was gone as completely as yesterday the lines ofhis face

knave of hearts</s>     to return for a moment to louis glanville</s>  he had been somewhat struckwith the abruptness of the bishops departure and more particularly bythe circumstance that he had gone

best to see you regarding your confirmation yesterday andmy reason for taking a more active step with you than i should otherwisehave done is that i have some interest in you through having known

 but there has been some mistake about the date of his death</s> he died of malarious fever on the banks of the zouga october 24 18</s> no he only lay ill there a long time it seems</s>  it was a companion whodied at that date</s>
 but ill read the account to your ladyship with yourpermission the decease of this somewhat eccentric wanderer did not occur at the time hitherto supposed but only in last december</s>  the following is the account of the englishman alluded to given as nearly as possible in his own words during the illness of sir blount and his friend by the zouga three of the servants went away taking with them a

approaching their second union with all the show andcircumstance of a new thing recommended itself to her strongly but forone objectionthat by such a course the wedding could not withoutappearing like

few marriedwomen have plimmed and chimped my lady among em why youve saidanighst all mr</s>  san cleeve</s> the conversation thus began was continued on divers matters till theywere all enveloped in total darkness when his old acquaintancesshouldered their faggots again and proceeded on their way</s> now that he was actually within her coasts again swithin felt a littlemore strongly the influence of the past and viviette than he had beenaccustomed to do for the last two or three years</s>  during the night hefelt half sorry that he had not marched off to the great house to seeher regardless of the time of day</s>  if she really nourished for him anyparticle of her old affection it had been the cruellest thing not tocall</s>  a few questions that he put concerning her to his grandmotherelicited that lady constantine had no friends about hernot even herbrotherand that her health had not been so good since her return frommelchester as formerly</s>  still this proved nothing as to the state ofher heart and as she had kept a dead silence since the bishops death itwas quite possible that she would meet him with that cold repressive toneand manner which experienced women know so well how to put on when theywish to intimate to the longlost lover that old episodes are to be takenas forgotten</s> the next morning he prepared to call if only on the ground of oldacquaintance for swithin was too straightforward to ascertain anythingindirectly</s>  it was rather too early for this purpose when he went outfrom his grandmothers gardengate after breakfast and he waited in thegarden</s>  while he lingered his eye fell on ringshill speer</s> it appeared dark for a moment against the blue sky behind it then thefleeting cloud which shadowed it passed on and the face of the columnbrightened into such luminousness that the sky behind sank to thecomplexion of a dark foil</s> surely somebody is on the column he said to himself after gazing atit awhile</s> instead of going straight to the great house he deviated through theinsulating field now sown with turnips which surrounded the plantationon ringshill</s>  by the time that he plunged under the trees he was stillmore certain that somebody was on the tower</s>  he crept up to the basewith proprietary curiosity for the spot seemed again like his own</s> the path still remained much as formerly but the nook in which the cabinhad stood was covered with undergrowth</s>  swithin entered the door of thetower ascended the staircase about halfway on tiptoe and listenedfor he did not wish to intrude on the top if any stranger were there</s>  thehollow spiral as he knew from old experience would bring down to hisears the slightest sound from above and it now revealed to him the wordsof a duologue in progress at the summit of the tower</s> mother what shall i do</s>  a childs voice said</s>  shall i sing</s> the mother seemed to assent for the child began the robin has fled from the wood to the snug habitation of man</s> this performance apparently attracted but little attention from thechilds companion for the young voice suggested as a new form ofentertainment shall i say my prayers</s> yes replied one whom swithin had begun to recognize</s> who shall i pray for</s> no answer</s> who shall i pray for</s> pray for father</s> but he is gone to heaven</s> a sigh from viviette was distinctly audible</s> you made a mistake didnt you mother</s>  continued the little one</s> i must have</s>  the strangest mistake a woman ever made</s> nothing more was said and swithin ascended words from above indicatingto him that his footsteps were heard</s>  in another halfminute he rosethrough the hatchway</s>  a lady in black was sitting in the sun and theboy with the flaxen hair whom he had seen yesterday was at her feet</s> viviette</s>  he said</s> swithin</s> at last</s>  she cried</s> the words died upon her lips and from very faintness she bent her head</s> for instead of rushing forward to her he had stood still and thereappeared upon his face a look which there was no mistaking</s> yes he was shocked at her worn and faded aspect</s>  the image he hadmentally carried out with him to the cape he had brought home again asthat of the woman he was now to rejoin</s>  but another woman sat beforehim and not the original viviette</s>  her cheeks had lost for ever thatfirm contour which had been drawn by the vigorous hand of youth and themasses of hair that were once darkness visible had become touched hereand there by a faint grey haze like the via lactea in a midnight sky</s> yet to those who had eyes to understand as well as to see the chastenedpensiveness of her once handsome features revealed more promisingmaterial beneath than ever her youth had done</s>  but swithin washopelessly her junior</s>  unhappily for her he had now just arrived at anage whose canon of faith it is that the silly period of womans life isher only period of beauty</s>  viviette saw it all and knew that time hadat last brought about his revenges</s>  she had tremblingly watched andwaited without sleep ever since swithin had reentered welland and itwas for this</s> swithin came forward and took her by the hand which she passivelyallowed him to do</s> swithin you dont love me she said simply</s> o viviette</s> you dont love me she repeated</s> dont say it</s> yes but i will</s>  you have a right not to love me</s>  you did once</s>  butnow i am an old woman and you are still a young man so how can you loveme</s>  i do not expect it</s>  it is kind and charitable of you to come andsee me here</s> i have come all the way from the cape he faltered for her insistencetook all power out of him to deny in mere politeness what she said</s> yes you have come from the cape but not for me she answered</s>  itwould be absurd if you had come for me</s>  you have come because your workthere is finished</s>  </s>  </s>  </s>  i like to sit here with my little boyit is apleasant spot</s>  it was once something to us was it not</s>  but that waslong ago</s>  you scarcely knew me for the same woman did you</s> knew youyes of course i knew you</s> you looked as if you did not</s>  but you must not be surprised at me</s>  ibelong to an earlier generation than you remember</s> thus in sheer bitterness of spirit did she inflict wounds on herself byexaggerating the difference in their years</s>  but she had neverthelessspoken truly</s>  sympathize with her as he might and as he unquestionablydid he loved her no longer</s>  but why had she expected otherwise</s>  owoman might a prophet have said to her great is thy faith if thoubelievest a junior lovers love will last five years</s> i shall be glad to know through your grandmother how you are gettingon she said meekly</s>  but now i would much rather that we part</s>  yesdo not question me</s>  i would rather that we part</s>  goodbye</s> hardly knowing what he did he touched her hand and obeyed</s>  he was ascientist and took words literally</s>  there is something in theinexorably simple logic of such men which partakes of the cruelty of thenatural laws that are their study</s>  he entered the towersteps andmechanically descended and it was not till he got halfway down that hethought she could not mean what she had said</s> before leaving cape town he had made up his mind on this one point thatif she were willing to marry him marry her he would without let orhindrance</s>  that much he morally owed her and was not the man to demur</s> and though the swithin who had returned was not quite the swithin who hadgone away though he could not now love her with the sort of love he hadonce bestowed he believed that all her conduct had been dictated by thepurest benevolence to him by that charity which seeketh not her own</s> hence he did not flinch from a wish to deal with lovingkindness towardshera sentiment perhaps in the longrun more to be prized than loverslove</s> her manner had caught him unawares but now recovering himself he turnedback determinedly</s>  bursting out upon the roof he clasped her in hisarms and kissed her several times</s> viviette viviette he said i have come to marry you</s> she uttered a shrieka shriek of amazed joysuch as never was heard onthat tower before or sinceand fell in his arms clasping his neck</s> there she lay heavily</s>  not to disturb her he sat down in her seat stillholding her fast</s>  their little son who had stood with round conjecturaleyes throughout the meeting now came close and presently looking up toswithin saidmother has gone to sleep</s> swithin looked down and started</s>  her tight clasp had loosened</s>  a waveof whiteness like that of marble which had never seen the sun crept upfrom her neck and travelled upwards and onwards over her cheek lipseyelids forehead temples its margin banishing back the live pink tillthe latter had entirely disappeared</s> seeing that something was wrong yet not understanding what the littleboy began to cry but in his concentration swithin hardly heard it</s> vivietteviviette</s>  he said</s> the child cried with still deeper grief and after a momentaryhesitation pushed his hand into swithins for protection</s> hush hush</s>  my child said swithin distractedly</s>  ill take care ofyou</s>  o viviette</s>  he exclaimed again pressing her face to his</s> but she did not reply</s> what can this be</s>  he asked himself</s>  he would not then answer accordingto his fear</s> he looked up for help</s>  nobody appeared in sight but tabitha lark whowas skirting the field with a bounding treadthe single bright spot ofcolour and animation within the wide horizon</s>  when he looked down againhis fear deepened to certainty</s>  it was no
