  sketches however have not yet been restored</s> sheintroductionin giving to the world the record of what looked at as an adventureonly is i suppose one of the most wonderful and mysterious experiencesever undergone by mortal men i feel it incumbent on me to explain whatmy exact connection with it is</s>  and so i may as well say at once that iam not the narrator but only the editor of this extraordinary historyand then go on to tell how it found its way into my hands</s> some years ago i the editor was stopping with a friend virdoctissimus et amicus neus at a certain university which for thepurposes of this history we will call cambridge and was one day muchstruck with the appearance of two persons whom i saw going arminarmdown the street</s>  one of these gentlemen was i think without exceptionthe handsomest young fellow i have ever seen</s>  he was very tall verybroad and had a look of power and a grace of bearing that seemed asnative to him as it is to a wild stag</s>  in addition his face was almostwithout flawa good face as well as a beautiful one and when he liftedhis hat which he did just then to a passing lady i saw that his headwas covered with little golden curls growing close to the scalp</s> good gracious</s>  i said to my friend with whom i was walking whythat fellow looks like a statue of apollo come to life</s>  what a splendidman he is</s> yes he answered he is the handsomest man in the university and oneof the nicest too</s>  they call him the greek god but look at the otherone hes vinceys thats the gods name guardian and supposed to befull of every kind of information</s>  they call him charon</s>  i lookedand found the older man quite as interesting in his way as the glorifiedspecimen of humanity at his side</s>  he appeared to be about forty yearsof age and was i think as ugly as his companion was handsome</s>  to beginwith he was shortish rather bowlegged very deep chested and withunusually long arms</s>  he had dark hair and small eyes and the hair grewright down on his forehead and his whiskers grew right up to his hairso that there was uncommonly little of his countenance to be seen</s> altogether he reminded me forcibly of a gorilla and yet there wassomething very pleasing and genial about the mans eye</s>  i remembersaying that i should like to know him</s> all right answered my friend nothing easier</s>  i know vinceyill introduce you and he did and for some minutes we stoodchattingabout the zulu people i think for i had just returned fromthe cape at the time</s>  presently however a stoutish lady whose namei do not remember came along the pavement accompanied by a prettyfairhaired girl and these two mr</s>  vincey who clearly knew them wellat once joined walking off in their company</s>  i remember being ratheramused because of the change in the expression of the elder man whosename i discovered was holly when he saw the ladies advancing</s>  hesuddenly stopped short in his talk cast a reproachful look at hiscompanion and with an abrupt nod to myself turned and marched offalone across the street</s>  i heard afterwards that he was popularlysupposed to be as much afraid of a woman as most people are of a maddog which accounted for his precipitate retreat</s>  i cannot say howeverthat young vincey showed much aversion to feminine society on thisoccasion</s>  indeed i remember laughing and remarking to my friend atthe time that he was not the sort of man whom it would be desirable tointroduce to the lady one was going to marry since it was exceedinglyprobable that the acquaintance would end in a transfer of heraffections</s>  he was altogether too goodlooking and what is morehe had none of that consciousness and conceit about him which usuallyafflicts handsome men and makes them deservedly disliked by theirfellows</s> that same evening my visit came to an end and this was the last i sawor heard of charon and the greek god for many a long day</s>  indeed ihave never seen either of them from that hour to this and do not thinkit probable that i shall</s>  but a month ago i received a letter and twopackets one of manuscript and on opening the first found that it wassigned by horace holly a name that at the moment was not familiar tome</s>  it ran as follows college cambridge may 1 18my dear siryou will be surprised considering the very slight natureof our acquaintance to get a letter from me</s>  indeed i think i hadbetter begin by reminding you that we once met now some five years agowhen i and my ward leo vincey were introduced to you in the street atcambridge</s>  to be brief and come to my business</s>  i have recentlyread with much interest a book of yours describing a central africanadventure</s>  i take it that this book is partly true and partly an effortof the imagination</s>  however this may be it has given me an idea</s>  ithappens how you will see in the accompanying manuscript which togetherwith the scarab the royal son of the sun and the original sherd iam sending to you by hand that my ward or rather my adopted son leovincey and myself have recently passed through a real african adventureof a nature so much more marvellous than the one which you describethat to tell the truth i am almost ashamed to submit it to you lest youshould disbelieve my tale</s>  you will see it stated in this manuscriptthat i or rather we had made up our minds not to make this historypublic during our joint lives</s>  nor should we alter our determinationwere it not for a circumstance which has recently arisen</s>  we are forreasons that after perusing this manuscript you may be able to guessgoing away again this time to central asia where if anywhere upon thisearth wisdom is to be found and we anticipate that our sojourn therewill be a long one</s>  possibly we shall not return</s>  under these alteredconditions it has become a question whether we are justified inwithholding from the world an account of a phenomenon which we believeto be of unparalleled interest merely because our private life isinvolved or because we are afraid of ridicule and doubt being castupon our statements</s>  i hold one view about this matter and leoholds another and finally after much discussion we have come to acompromise namely to send the history to you giving you full leave topublish it if you think fit the only stipulation being that you shalldisguise our real names and as much concerning our personal identity asis consistent with the maintenance of the bona fides of the narrative</s> and now what am i to say further</s>  i really do not know beyond once morerepeating that everything is described in the accompanying manuscriptexactly as it happened</s>  as regards she herself i have nothing to add</s> day by day we gave greater occasion to regret that we did not betteravail ourselves of our opportunities to obtain more information fromthat marvellous woman</s>  who was she</s>  how did she first come to the cavesof kr and what was her real religion</s>  we never ascertained and nowalas</s>  we never shall at least not yet</s>  these and many other questionsarise in my mind but what is the good of asking them now</s> will you undertake the task</s>  we give you complete freedom and as areward you will we believe have the credit of presenting to the worldthe most wonderful history as distinguished from romance that itsrecords can show</s>  read the manuscript which i have copied out fairlyfor your benefit and let me know</s> believe me very truly yours l</s>  horace holly</s> p</s> s</s> of course if any profit results from the sale of the writingshould you care to undertake its publication you can do what youlike with it but if there is a loss i will leave instructions with mylawyers messrs</s>  geoffrey and jordan to meet it</s>  we entrust the sherdthe scarab and the parchments to your keeping till such time as wedemand them back again</s>  l</s>  h</s>  h</s>    this name is varied throughout in accordance with the  writers request</s> editor</s> this letter as may be imagined astonished me considerably but when icame to look at the ms</s>  which the pressure of other work prevented mefrom doing for a fortnight i was still more astonished as i think thereader will be also and at once made up my mind to press on with thematter</s>  i wrote to this effect to mr</s>  holly but a week afterwardsreceived a letter from that gentlemans lawyers returning my own withthe information that their client and mr</s>  leo vincey had already leftthis country for thibet and they did not at present know their address</s> well that is all i have to say</s>  of the history itself the reader mustjudge</s>  i give it him with the exception of a very few alterationsmade with the object of concealing the identity of the actors from thegeneral public exactly as it came to me</s>  personally i have made up mymind to refrain from comments</s>  at first i was inclined to believe thatthis history of a woman on whom clothed in the majesty of her almostendless years the shadow of eternity itself lay like the dark wingof night was some gigantic allegory of which i could not catch themeaning</s>  then i thought that it might be a bold attempt to portray thepossible results of practical immortality informing the substance ofa mortal who yet drew her strength from earth and in whose human bosompassions yet rose and fell and beat as in the undying world around herthe winds and the tides rise and fall and beat unceasingly</s>  but as iwent on i abandoned that idea also</s>  to me the story seems to bear thestamp of truth upon its face</s>  its explanation i must leave to othersand with this slight preface which circumstances make necessary iintroduce the world to ayesha and the caves of kr</s> the editor</s> p</s> s</s> there is on consideration one circumstance that after a reperusalof this history struck me with so much force that i cannot resistcalling the attention of the reader to it</s>  he will observe that so faras we are made acquainted with him there appears to be nothing in thecharacter of leo vincey which in the opinion of most people would havebeen likely to attract an intellect so powerful as that of ayesha</s>  he isnot even at any rate to my view particularly interesting</s>  indeed onemight imagine that mr</s>  holly would under ordinary circumstances haveeasily outstripped him in the favour of she</s>  can it be that extremesmeet and that the very excess and splendour of her mind led her bymeans of some strange physical reaction to worship at the shrine ofmatter</s>  was that ancient kallikrates nothing but a splendid animalloved for his hereditary greek beauty</s>  or is the true explanation whati believe it to benamely that ayesha seeing further than we cansee perceived the germ and smouldering spark of greatness which lay hidwithin her lovers soul and well knew that under the influence of hergift of life watered by her wisdom and shone upon with the sunshineof her presence it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a starfilling the world with light and fragrance</s> here also i am not able to answer but must leave the reader to form hisown judgment on the facts before him as detailed by mr</s>  holly in thefollowing pages</s> imy visitorthere are some events of which each circumstance and surrounding detailseems to be graven on the memory in such fashion that we cannot forgetit and so it is with the scene that i am about to describe</s>  it risesas clearly before my mind at this moment as though it had happened butyesterday</s> it was in this very month something over twenty years ago that i ludwighorace holly was sitting one night in my rooms at cambridge grindingaway at some mathematical work i forget what</s>  i was to go up for myfellowship within a week and was expected by my tutor and my collegegenerally to distinguish myself</s>  at last wearied out i flung my bookdown and going to the mantelpiece took down a pipe and filled it</s> there was a candle burning on the mantelpiece and a long narrow glassat the back of it and as i was in the act of lighting the pipe i caughtsight of my own countenance in the glass and paused to reflect</s>  thelighted match burnt away till it scorched my fingers forcing me to dropit but still i stood and stared at myself in the glass and reflected</s> well i said aloud at last it is to be hoped that i shall be ableto do something with the inside of my head for i shall certainly neverdo anything by the help of the outside</s> this remark will doubtless strike anybody who reads it as being slightlyobscure but i was in reality alluding to my physical deficiencies</s> most men of twentytwo are endowed at any rate with some share of thecomeliness of youth but to me even this was denied</s>  short thicksetand deepchested almost to deformity with long sinewy arms heavyfeatures deepset grey eyes a low brow half overgrown with a mop ofthick black hair like a deserted clearing on which the forest had oncemore begun to encroach such was my appearance nearly a quarter of acentury ago and such with some modification it is to this day</s> like cain i was brandedbranded by nature with the stamp of abnormalugliness as i was gifted by nature with iron and abnormal strength andconsiderable intellectual powers</s>  so ugly was i that the spruceyoung men of my college though they were proud enough of my feats ofendurance and physical prowess did not even care to be seen walkingwith me</s>  was it wonderful that i was misanthropic and sullen</s>  was itwonderful that i brooded and worked alone and had no friendsat leastonly one</s>  i was set apart by nature to live alone and draw comfortfrom her breast and hers only</s>  women hated the sight of me</s>  only a weekbefore i had heard one call me a monster when she thought i was outof hearing and say that i had converted her to the monkey theory</s>  onceindeed a woman pretended to care for me and i lavished all the pentupaffection of my nature upon her</s>  then money that was to have come to mewent elsewhere and she discarded me</s>  i pleaded with her as i have neverpleaded with any living creature before or since for i was caught byher sweet face and loved her and in the end by way of answer she tookme to the glass and stood side by side with me and looked into it</s> now she said if i am beauty who are you</s>  that was when i was onlytwenty</s> and so i stood and stared and felt a sort of grim satisfaction in thesense of my own loneliness for i had neither father nor mother norbrother and as i did so there came a knock at my door</s> i listened before i went to open it for it was nearly twelve oclock atnight and i was in no mood to admit any stranger</s>  i had but one friendin the college or indeed in the worldperhaps it was he</s> just then the person outside the door coughed and i hastened to openit for i knew the cough</s> a tall man of about thirty with the remains of great personal beautycame hurrying in staggering beneath the weight of a massive iron boxwhich he carried by a handle with his right hand</s>  he placed the box uponthe table and then fell into an awful fit of coughing</s>  he coughed andcoughed till his face became quite purple and at last he sank intoa chair and began to spit up blood</s>  i poured out some whisky into atumbler and gave it to him</s>  he drank it and seemed better though hisbetter was very bad indeed</s> why did you keep me standing there in the cold</s>  he asked pettishly</s> you know the draughts are death to me</s> i did not know who it was i answered</s>  you are a late visitor</s> yes and i verily believe it is my last visit he answered with aghastly attempt at a smile</s>  i am done for holly</s>  i am done for</s>  i donot believe that i shall see tomorrow</s> nonsense</s>  i said</s>  let me go for a doctor</s> he waved me back

some one to whom i could confide the boy andthis and he tapped the iron box</s>  you are the man holly for like arugged tree you are hard and sound at core</s>  listen the boy will be theonly representative of one of the most ancient families in the worldthat is so far as families can be traced</s>  you will laugh at me wheni say it but one day it will be proved to you beyond a doubt that mysixtyfifth or sixtysixth lineal ancestor was an egyptian priestof isis though he was himself of grecian extraction and was calledkallikrates</s>  his father was one of the greek mercenaries raisedby hakhor a mendesian pharaoh of the twentyninth dynasty and hisgrandfather or greatgrandfather i believe was that very kallikratesmentioned by herodotus</s>  in or about the year 339 before christ justat the time of the final fall of the pharaohs this kallikrates thepriest broke his vows of celibacy and fled from egypt with a princessof royal blood who had fallen in love with him and was finally wreckedupon the coast of africa somewhere as i believe in the neighbourhoodof where delagoa bay now is or rather to the north of it he and hiswife being saved and all the remainder of their company destroyed inone way or another</s>  here they endured great hardships but were at lastentertained by the mighty queen of a savage people a white woman ofpeculiar loveliness who under

too they remained for another five centuries or moretill about 770 a</s> d</s>  when charlemagne invaded lombardy where they werethen settled whereon the head of the family seems to have

ended disastrously enough</s>  on my wayback i travelled in the south of europe and finally reached athens</s> there i met my beloved wife who might well also have been called thebeautiful like my old greek ancestor</s>  there i married her and therea year afterwards when my boy was born she died</s>    the strong and beautiful or more accurately the  beautiful in strength</s>    the kallikrates here referred to by my friend was a  spartan spoken of by herodotus herod</s>  ix</s>  72 as being  remarkable for his beauty</s>  he fell at the glorious battle of  plata september 22 b</s> c</s>  479 when the lacedmonians  and athenians under pausanias routed the persians putting  nearly 300000 of them to the sword</s>  the following is a  translation of the passage for kallikrates died out of the  battle he came to the army the most beautiful man of the  greeks of that daynot only of the lacedmonians  themselves but of the other greeks also</s>  he when pausanias  was sacrificing was wounded in the side by an arrow and  then they fought but on being carried off he regretted his  death and said to arimnestus a platan that he did not  grieve at dying for greece but at not having struck a blow  or although he desired so to do performed any deed worthy  of himself</s>  this kallikrates who appears to have been as  brave as he was beautiful is subsequently mentioned by  herodotus as having been buried among the   young commanders apart from the other spartans and the  helots</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> he paused a while his head sunk upon his hand and then continuedmy

thatbeing so what did it mean</s>  and what was in the sealed iron chest</s> the whole thing baffled and puzzled me to such an extent that at last icould stand it no longer and determined to sleep

rooms and sank into an easy chair with ahappy consciousness that i had got through it very fairly</s> soon however my thoughts relieved of the pressure that had crushedthem into a single groove during

boughtsome books upon the health and management of children and read themfirst to myself and then aloud to jobthat was the young mansnameand waited</s> at length the child arrived in the charge of an elderly person who weptbitterly at parting with him and a beautiful boy he was</s>  indeed i donot think that i ever saw such a perfect child before or since</s>  his eyeswere grey his forehead was broad and his face even at that early ageclean cut as a cameo without being pinched or thin</s>  but perhaps hismost attractive point was his hair which was pure gold in colour andtightly curled over his shapely head</s>  he cried a little when his nursefinally tore herself away and left him with us</s>  never shall i forget thescene</s>  there he stood with the sunlight from the window playing uponhis golden curls his fist screwed over one eye whilst he took us inwith the other</s>  i was seated in a chair and stretched out my hand tohim to induce him to come to me while job in the corner was making asort of clucking noise which arguing from his previous experience orfrom the analogy of the hen he judged would have a soothing effect andinspire confidence in the youthful mind and running a wooden horse ofpeculiar hideousness backwards and forwards in a way that was littleshort of inane</s>  this went on for some minutes and then all of a suddenthe lad stretched out both his little arms and ran to me</s> i like you he said you is ugly but you is good</s> ten minutes afterwards he was eating large slices of bread and butterwith every sign of satisfaction job wanted to put jam on to them buti sternly reminded him of the excellent works that we had read andforbade it</s> in a very little while for as i expected i got my fellowship theboy became the favourite of the whole collegewhere all orders andregulations to the contrary notwithstanding he was continually inand outa sort of chartered libertine in whose favour all rules wererelaxed</s>  the offerings made at his shrine were simply without numberand i had serious difference of opinion with one old resident fellownow long dead who was usually supposed to be the crustiest man in theuniversity and to abhor the sight of a child</s>  and yet i discoveredwhen a frequently recurring fit of sickness had forced job to keep astrict lookout that this unprincipled old man was in the habit ofenticing the boy to his rooms and there feeding him upon unlimitedquantities of brandyballs and making him promise to say nothing aboutit</s>  job told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself at his agetoo when he might have been a grandfather if he had done what wasright by which job understood had got married and thence arose therow</s> but i have no space to dwell upon those delightful years around whichmemory still fondly hovers</s>  one by one they went by and as they passedwe two grew dearer and yet more dear to each other</s>  few sons havebeen loved as i love leo and few fathers know the deep and continuousaffection that leo bears to me</s> the child grew into the boy and the boy into the young man while oneby one the remorseless years flew by and as he grew and increased sodid his beauty and the beauty of his mind grow with him</s>  when he wasabout fifteen they used to call him beauty about the college and methey nicknamed the beast</s>  beauty and the beast was what they called uswhen we went out walking together as we used to do every day</s>  once leoattacked a great strapping butchers man twice his size because hesang it out after us and thrashed him toothrashed him fairly</s>  iwalked on and pretended not to see till the combat got too excitingwhen i turned round and cheered him on to victory</s>  it was the chaff ofthe college at the time but i could not help it</s>  then when he was alittle older the undergraduates found fresh names for us</s>  they called mecharon and leo the greek god</s>  i will pass over my own appellation withthe humble remark that i was never handsome and did not grow more so asi grew older</s>  as for his there was no doubt about its fitness</s>  leo attwentyone might have stood for a statue of the youthful apollo</s>  i neversaw anybody to touch him in looks or anybody so absolutely unconsciousof them</s>  as for his mind he was brilliant and keenwitted but not ascholar</s>  he had not the dulness necessary for that result</s>  we followedout his fathers instructions as regards his education strictly enoughand on the whole the results especially in the matters of greek andarabic were satisfactory</s>  i learnt the latter language in order to helpto teach it to him but after five years of it he knew it as well as ididalmost as well as the professor who instructed us both</s>  i alwayswas a great sportsmanit is my one passionand every autumn we wentaway somewhere shooting or fishing sometimes to scotland sometimesto norway once even to russia</s>  i am a good shot but even in this helearnt to excel me</s> when leo was eighteen i moved back into my rooms and entered him at myown college and at twentyone he took his degreea respectable degreebut not a very high one</s>  then it was that i for the first time toldhim something of his own story and of the mystery that loomed ahead</s> of course he was very curious about it and of course i explained tohim that his curiosity could not be gratified at present</s>  after that topass the time away i suggested that he should get himself called to thebar and this he did reading at cambridge and only going up to londonto eat his dinners</s> i had only one trouble about him and that was that every young womanwho came across him or if not every one nearly so would insist onfalling in love with him</s>  hence arose difficulties which i need notenter into here though they were troublesome enough at the time</s>  on thewhole he behaved fairly well i cannot say more than that</s> and so the time went by till at last he reached his twentyfifthbirthday at which date this strange and in some ways awful historyreally begins</s> iiithe sherd of amenartason the day preceding leos twentyfifth birthday we both journeyed tolondon and extracted the mysterious chest from the bank where i haddeposited it twenty years before</s>  it was i remember brought up by thesame clerk who had taken it down</s>  he perfectly remembered having hiddenit away</s>  had he not done so he said he should have had difficulty infinding it it was so covered up with cobwebs</s> in the evening we returned with our precious burden to cambridge and ithink that we might both of us have given away all the sleep we got thatnight and not have been much the poorer</s>  at daybreak leo arrived in myroom in a dressinggown and suggested that we should at once proceed tobusiness</s>  i scouted the idea as showing an unworthy curiosity</s>  the chesthad waited twenty years i said so it could very well continue to waituntil after breakfast</s>  accordingly at ninean unusually sharp ninewebreakfasted and so occupied was i with my own thoughts that i regret tostate that i put a piece of bacon into leos tea in mistake for a lumpof sugar</s>  job too to whom the contagion of excitement had of coursespread managed to break the handle off my svres china teacup theidentical one i believe that marat had been drinking from just before hewas stabbed in his bath</s> at last however breakfast was cleared away and job at my requestfetched the chest and placed it upon the table in a somewhat gingerlyfashion as though he mistrusted it</s>  then he prepared to leave the room</s> stop a moment job i said</s>  if mr</s>  leo has no objection i shouldprefer to have an independent witness to this business who can berelied upon to hold his tongue unless he is asked to speak</s> certainly uncle horace answered leo for i had brought him up tocall me unclethough he varied the appellation somewhat disrespectfullyby calling me old fellow or even my avuncular relative</s> job touched his head not having a hat on</s> lock the door job i said and bring me my despatchbox</s> he obeyed and from the box i took the keys that poor vincey leosfather had given me on the night of his death</s>  there were three ofthem the largest a comparatively modern key the second an exceedinglyancient one and the third entirely unlike anything of the sort that wehad ever seen before being fashioned apparently from a strip of solidsilver with a bar placed across to serve as a handle and leavingsome nicks cut in the edge of the bar</s>  it was more like a model of anantediluvian railway key than anything else</s> now are you both ready</s>  i said as people do when they are going tofire a mine</s>  there was no answer so i took the big key rubbed somesalad oil into the wards and after one or two bad shots for my handswere shaking managed to fit it and shoot the lock</s>  leo bent over andcaught the massive lid in both his hands and with an effort for thehinges had rusted forced it back</s>  its removal revealed another casecovered with dust</s>  this we extracted from the iron chest without anydifficulty and removed the accumulated filth of years from it with aclothesbrush</s> it was or appeared to be of ebony or some such closegrained blackwood and was bound in every direction with flat bands of iron</s>  itsantiquity must have been extreme for the dense heavy wood was in partsactually commencing to crumble from age</s> now for it i said inserting the second key</s> job and leo bent forward in breathless silence</s>  the key turned andi flung back the lid and uttered an exclamation and no wonder forinside the ebony case was a magnificent silver casket about twelveinches square by eight high</s>  it appeared to be of egyptian workmanshipand the four legs were formed of sphinxes and the domeshaped cover wasalso surmounted by a sphinx</s>  the casket was of course much tarnished anddinted with age but otherwise in fairly sound condition</s> i drew it out and set it on the table and then in the midst of themost perfect silence i inserted the strangelooking silver key andpressed this way and that until at last the lock yielded and the casketstood before us</s>  it was filled to the brim with some brown shreddedmaterial more like vegetable fibre than paper the nature of which ihave never been able to discover</s>  this i carefully removed to the depthof some three inches when i came to a letter enclosed in an ordinarymodernlooking envelope and addressed in the handwriting of my deadfriend vincey</s> to my son leo should he live to open this casket</s> i handed the letter to leo who glanced at the envelope and then put itdown upon the table making a motion to me to go on emptying the casket</s> the next thing that i found was a parchment carefully rolled up</s>  iunrolled it and seeing that it was also in vinceys handwriting andheaded translation of the uncial greek writing on the potsherd putit down by the letter</s>  then followed another ancient roll of parchmentthat had become yellow and crinkled with the passage of years</s>  this ialso unrolled</s>  it was likewise a translation of the same greek originalbut into blackletter latin which at the first glance from the styleand character appeared to me to date from somewhere about the beginningof the sixteenth century</s>  immediately beneath this roll was somethinghard and heavy wrapped up in yellow linen and reposing upon anotherlayer of the fibrous material</s>
 slowly and carefully we unrolled thelinen exposing to view a very large but undoubtedly ancient potsherdof a dirty yellow colour</s>  this potsherd had in my judgment once beena part of an ordinary amphora of medium size</s>  for the rest it measuredten and a half inches in length by seven in width was about a quarterof an inch thick and densely covered on the convex side that laytowards the bottom of the box with writing in the later uncial greekcharacter faded here and there but for the most part perfectlylegible the inscription having evidently been executed with thegreatest care and by means of a reed pen such as the ancientsoften used</s>  i must not forget to mention that in some remote age thiswonderful fragment had been broken in two and rejoined by means ofcement and eight long rivets</s>  also there were numerous inscriptions onthe inner side but these were of the most erratic character and hadclearly been made by different hands and in many different ages andof them together with the writings on the parchments i shall have tospeak presently</s>   plate 1  facsimile of the sherd of amenartas  one 12 size  greatest length of the original 10 inches  greatest breadth    7 inches  weight      1lb 5 oz  plate 2  facsimile of the sherd of amenartas  one 12 sizeis there anything more</s>  asked leo in a kind of excited whisper</s> i groped about and produced something hard done up in a little linenbag</s>  out of the bag we took first a very beautiful miniature doneupon ivory and secondly a small chocolatecoloured compositionscarabus marked thussketch omittedsymbols which we have since ascertained mean suten se ra which isbeing translated the royal son of ra or the sun</s>
 the miniature was apicture of leos greek mothera lovely darkeyed creature</s>  on the backof it was written in poor vinceys handwriting my beloved wife</s> that is all i said</s> very well answered leo putting down the miniature at which hehad been gazing affectionately and now let us read the letter andwithout further ado he broke the seal and read aloud as followsmy son leowhen you open this

replying enough of myself</s>  what has tobe said belongs to you who live not to me who am dead and almost asmuch forgotten as though i had never been</s>  holly my friend to whom ifhe will accept the trust it is my intention to confide you will havetold you something of the extraordinary antiquity of your race</s>  inthe contents of this casket you will find sufficient to prove it</s>  thestrange legend that you will find inscribed by your remote ancestressupon the potsherd was communicated to me by my father on his deathbedand took a strong hold in my imagination</s>  when i was only nineteen yearsof age i determined as to his misfortune did one of our ancestorsabout the time of elizabeth to investigate its truth</s>  into all thatbefell me i cannot enter now</s>  but this i saw with my own eyes</s>  on thecoast of africa in a hitherto unexplored region some distance to thenorth of where the zambesi falls into the sea there is a headlandat the extremity of which a peak towers up shaped like the head of anegro similar to that of which the writing speaks</s>  i landed thereand learnt from a wandering native who had been cast out by his peoplebecause of some crime which he had committed that far inland are greatmountains shaped like cups and caves surrounded by measureless swamps</s> i learnt also that the people there speak a dialect of arabic and areruled over by a beautiful white woman who is seldom seen by them butwho is reported to have power over all things living and dead</s>  twodays after i had ascertained this the man died of fever contractedin crossing the swamps and i was forced by want of provisions and bysymptoms of an illness which afterwards prostrated me to take to my dhowagain</s> of the adventures that befell me after this i need not now speak</s>  i waswrecked upon the coast of madagascar and rescued some months afterwardsby an english ship that brought me to aden whence i started forengland intending to prosecute my search as soon

that my last illnessseized me and i returned hither to die</s>  but still i hoped against hopeand set myself to work to learn arabic with the intention should iever get better of returning to the coast of africa and solvingthe mystery of which the tradition has lived so many centuries in ourfamily</s>  but i have not got better and so far as i am concerned thestory is at an end</s> for you however my son it is not at an end and to you i hand onthese the results of my labour together with the hereditary proofs ofits origin</s>  it is my intention to provide that they shall not be putinto your hands until you have reached an age when you will be able tojudge for yourself whether or no you will choose to investigate what ifit is true must be the greatest mystery in the world or to put it byas an idle fable originating in the first place in a womans disorderedbrain</s> i do not believe that it is a fable i believe that if it can onlybe rediscovered there is a spot where the vital forces of the worldvisibly exist</s>  life exists why therefore should not the means ofpreserving it indefinitely exist also</s>  but i have no wish to prejudiceyour mind about the matter</s>  read and judge for yourself</s>  if you areinclined to undertake the search i have so provided that you will notlack for means</s>  if on the other hand you are satisfied that the wholething is a chimera then i adjure you destroy the potsherd and thewritings and let a cause of troubling be removed from our race forever</s>  perhaps that will be wisest</s>  the unknown is generally taken to beterrible

well i said when at length i had read out and carefully examinedthese writings and paragraphs at least those of them that were stilleasily legible that is the conclusion of the whole matter leo andnow you can form your own opinion on it</s>  i have already formed mine</s> and what is it</s>  he asked in his quick way</s> it is this</s>  i believe that potsherd to be perfectly genuine and thatwonderful as it may seem it has come down in your family from sincethe fourth century before christ</s>  the entries absolutely prove it andtherefore however improbable it may seem it must be accepted</s>  butthere i stop</s>  that your remote ancestress the egyptian princess orsome scribe under her direction wrote that which we see on the sherdi have no doubt nor have i the slightest doubt but that her sufferingsand the loss of her husband had turned her head and that she was notright in her mind when she did write it</s> how do you account for what my father saw and heard there</s>  asked leo</s> coincidence</s>  no doubt there are bluffs on the coast of africa thatlook something like a mans head and plenty of people who speak bastardarabic</s>  also i believe that there are lots of swamps</s>  another thingis leo and i am sorry to say it but i do not believe that your poorfather was quite right when he wrote that letter</s>  he had met witha great trouble and also he had allowed this story to prey on hisimagination and he was a very imaginative man</s>  anyway i believe thatthe whole thing is the most unmitigated rubbish</s>  i know that there arecurious things and forces in nature which we rarely meet with and whenwe do meet them cannot understand</s>  but until i see it with my own eyeswhich i am not likely to i never will believe that there is any meansof avoiding death even for a time or that there is or was a whitesorceress living in the heart of an african swamp</s>  it is bosh my boyall bosh</s> what do you say job</s> i say sir that it is a lie and if it is true i hope mr</s>  leo wontmeddle with no such things for no good cant come of it</s> perhaps you are both right said leo very quietly</s>  i express noopinion</s>  but i say this</s>  i am going to set the matter at rest once andfor all and if you wont come with me i will go by myself</s> i looked at the young man and saw that he meant what he said</s>  when leomeans what he says he always puts on a curious look about the mouth</s>  ithas been a trick of his from a child</s>  now as a matter of fact i had nointention of allowing leo to go anywhere by himself for my own sake ifnot for his</s>  i was far too attached to him for that</s>  i am not a manof many ties or affections</s>  circumstances have been against me in thisrespect and men and women shrink from me or at least i fancy thatthey do which comes to the same thing thinking perhaps that mysomewhat forbidding exterior is a key to my character</s>  rather thanendure this i have to a great extent secluded myself from the worldand cut myself off from those opportunities which with most men resultin the formation of relations more or less intimate</s>  therefore leo wasall the world to mebrother child

ivthe squallhow different is the scene that i have now to tell from that which hasjust been told</s>  gone are the quiet college rooms gone the windswayedenglish elms the cawing rooks and the familiar volumes on the shelvesand in their place there rises a vision of the great calm ocean gleamingin shaded silver lights beneath the beams of the full african moon</s>  agentle breeze fills the huge sail of our dhow and draws us throughthe water that ripples musically against her sides</s>  most of the men aresleeping forward for it is near midnight but a stout swarthy arabmahomed by name stands at the tiller lazily steering by the stars</s> three miles or more to our starboard is a low dim line</s>  it is theeastern shore of central africa</s>  we are running to the southward beforethe north east monsoon between the mainland and the reef that forhundreds of miles fringes this perilous coast</s>  the night is quiet soquiet that a whisper can be heard fore and aft the dhow so quiet that afaint booming sound rolls across the water to us from the distant land</s> the arab at the tiller holds up his hand and says one wordsimbalion</s> we all sit up and listen</s>  then it comes again a slow majestic soundthat thrills us to the marrow</s> tomorrow by ten oclock i say we ought if the captain is not outin his reckoning which i think very probable to make this mysteriousrock with a mans head and begin our shooting</s> and begin our search for the ruined city and the fire of lifecorrected leo taking his pipe from his mouth and laughing a little</s> nonsense</s>  i answered</s>  you were airing your arabic with that man atthe tiller this afternoon</s>  what did he tell you</s>  he has been tradingslavetrading probably up and down these latitudes for half of hisiniquitous life and once landed on this very man rock</s>  did he everhear anything of the ruined city or the caves</s> no answered leo</s>  he says that the country is all swamp behind andfull of snakes especially pythons and game and that no man livesthere</s>  but then there is a belt of swamp all along the east africancoast so that does not go for much</s> yes i said it doesit goes for malaria</s>  you see what sort of anopinion these gentry have of the country</s>  not one of them will go withus</s>  they think that we are mad and upon my word i believe that they areright</s>  if ever we see old

tiller i said</s> he rose stretched his arms and went</s>  presently he returned</s> he says it is a squall but it will pass far on one side of us</s> just then job came up looking very stout and english in hisshootingsuit of brown flannel and with a sort of perplexed appearanceupon his honest round face that had been very common with him since hegot into these strange waters</s> please sir he said touching his sun hat which was stuck on to theback of his head in a somewhat ludicrous fashion as we have got allthose guns and things in the whaleboat astern to say nothing of theprovisions in the lockers i think it would be best if i got down andslept in her</s>  i dont like the looks here he dropped his voice to aportentous whisper of these black gentry they have such a wonderfulthievish way about them</s>  supposing now that some of them were to slipinto the boat at night and cut the cable and make off with her</s>  thatwould be a pretty go that would</s> the whaleboat i may explain was one specially built for us at dundeein scotland</s>  we had brought it with us as we knew that this coast was anetwork of creeks and that we might require something to navigatethem with</s>  she was a beautiful boat thirtyfeet in length with acentreboard for sailing copperbottomed to keep the worm out of herand full of watertight compartments</s>  the captain of the dhow had toldus that when we reached the rock which he knew and which appeared tobe identical with the one described upon the sherd and by leos fatherhe would probably not be able to run up to it on account of the shallowsand breakers</s>  therefore we had employed three hours that very morningwhilst we were totally becalmed the wind having dropped at sunrisein transferring most of our goods and chattels to the whaleboatand placing the guns ammunition and preserved provisions in thewatertight lockers specially prepared for them so that when we didsight the fabled rock we should have nothing to do but step into theboat and run her ashore</s>  another reason that induced us to take thisprecautionary step was that arab captains are apt to run past the pointthat they are making either from carelessness or owing to a mistake inits identity</s>  now as sailors know it is quite impossible for a dhowwhich is only rigged to run before the monsoon to beat back against it</s> therefore we got our boat ready to row for the rock at any moment</s> well job i said perhaps it would be as well</s>  there are lots ofblankets there only be careful to keep out of the moon or it may turnyour head or blind you</s> lord sir</s>  i dont think it would much matter if it did it is thatturned already with the sight of these blackamoors and their filthythieving ways</s>  they are only fit for muck they are and they smell badenough for it already</s> job it will be perceived was no admirer of the manners and customs ofour darkskinned brothers</s> accordingly we hauled up the boat by the towrope till it was rightunder the stern of the dhow and job bundled into her with all the graceof a falling sack of potatoes</s>  then we returned and sat down on the deckagain and smoked and talked in little gusts and jerks</s>  the night was solovely and our brains were so full of suppressed excitement of one sortand another that we did not feel inclined to turn in</s>  for nearly anhour we sat thus and then i think we both dozed off</s>  at least i havea faint recollection of leo sleepily explaining that the head was not abad place to hit a buffalo if you could catch him exactly between thehorns or send your bullet down his throat or some nonsense of thesort</s> then i remember no more till suddenlya frightful roar of wind ashriek of terror from the awakening crew and a whiplike sting of waterin our faces</s>  some of the men ran to let go the haulyards and lower thesail but the parrel jammed and the yard would not come down</s>

calmand in it i heard jobs voice yelling wildly come here to the boat</s> bewildered and halfdrowned as i was i had the sense to rush aft</s>  ifelt the dhow sinking under meshe was full of water</s>  under her counterthe whaleboat was tossing furiously and i saw the arab mahomed whohad been steering leap into her</s>  i gave one desperate pull at thetowrope to bring the boat alongside</s>  wildly

hidden now by the wreaths of the rushing storm buta little light still caught the crest of the devouring breaker</s>  therewas something dark on ita piece of wreckage</s>  it was on us now andthe boat was nearly full of water</s>  but she was built in airtightcompartmentsheaven bless the man who invented them</s> and lifted upthrough it like a swan</s>  through the foam and turmoil i saw the blackthing on the wave hurrying right at me</s>  i put out my right arm to wardit from me and my hand closed on another arm the wrist of which myfingers gripped like a vice</s>  i am a very strong man

it</s>  but it passed leaving us upto our knees in water</s> bail out</s>  bail out</s>  shouted job suiting the action to the word</s> but i could not bail just then for as the moon went out and left

waveback dead or alive from thevery jaws of death</s> bail out</s>  bail out</s>  yelled job or we shall founder</s> i seized a large tin bowl with a handle to it which was fixed under oneof the seats

began to lighten and nofresh wave swamped us</s>  five minutes more and she was fairly clear</s> then suddenly above the awful shriekings of the hurricane came aduller deeper roar</s>  great

arrows of her light and there half a mile ahead of us was awhite line of foam then a little space of openmouthed blackness andthen another line of white</s>  it was the breakers and their roar grewclearer and yet more clear as we sped down upon them like a swallow</s> there they were boiling up in snowy spouts of spray smiting andgnashing together like the gleaming teeth of hell</s> take the tiller mahomed</s>  i roared in arabic</s>  we must try and shootthem</s>  at the same moment i seized an oar and got it out motioning tojob to do likewise</s> mahomed clambered aft and got hold of the tiller and with somedifficulty job who had sometimes pulled a tub upon the homely cam gotout his oar</s>  in another minute the boats head was straight on to theevernearing foam towards which

turned and pointed to it</s> steer for your life mahomed</s>  i yelled</s>  he was a skilful steersmanand well acquainted with the dangers of this most perilous coast and isaw him grip the tiller bend

starboard</s>  if we struck the line of breakers fifty yards to starboardof the gap we must sink</s>  it was a great field of twisting spoutingwaves</s>  mahomed planted his foot against the seat

job to back water whilst idragged and laboured at my oar</s>  she answered now and none too soon</s> heavens we were in them</s>  and then followed a couple of minutes ofheartbreaking excitement such as i cannot hope to describe</s>  all that iremember is a shrieking sea of foam out of which the billows rose herethere and everywhere like avenging ghosts from their ocean grave</s>  oncewe were turned right round but either by chance or through mahomedsskilful steering the boats head came straight again before a breakerfilled us</s>  one morea monster</s>  we were through it or over itmorethrough than overand then with a wild yell of exultation from thearab we shot out into the comparative smooth water of the mouth of seabetween the teethlike lines of gnashing waves</s> but we were nearly full of water again and not more than half a mileahead was the second line of breakers</s>  again we set to and bailedfuriously</s>  fortunately the storm had now quite gone by and the moonshone brightly revealing a rocky headland running half a mile or moreout into the sea of which this second line of breakers appeared to bea continuation</s>  at any rate they boiled around its foot</s>  probably theridge that formed the headland ran out into the ocean only at a lowerlevel and made the reef also</s>  this headland was terminated by a curiouspeak that seemed not to be more than a mile away from us</s>  just as we gotthe boat pretty clear for the second time leo to my immense reliefopened his eyes and remarked that the clothes had tumbled off the bedand that he supposed it was time to get up for chapel</s>  i told him toshut his eyes and keep quiet which he did without in the slightestdegree realizing the position</s>  as for myself his reference to chapelmade me reflect with a sort of sick longing on my comfortable roomsat cambridge</s>  why had i been such a fool as to leave them</s>  this is areflection that has several times recurred to me since and with aneverincreasing force</s> but now again we were drifting down on the breakers though withlessened speed for the wind had fallen and only the current or thetide it afterwards turned out to be the tide was driving us</s> another minute and with a sort of howl to allah from the arab a piousejaculation from myself and something that was not pious from jobwe were in them</s>  and then the whole scene down to our final escaperepeated itself only not quite so violently</s>  mahomeds skilful steeringand the airtight compartments saved our lives</s>  in five minutes we werethrough and driftingfor we were too exhausted to do anything tohelp ourselves except keep her head straightwith the most startlingrapidity round the headland which i have described</s> round we went with the tide until we got well under the lee of thepoint and then suddenly the speed slackened we ceased to make wayand finally appeared to be in dead water</s>  the storm had entirely passedleaving a cleanwashed sky behind it the headland intercepted the heavysea that had been occasioned by the squall and the tide which hadbeen running so fiercely up the river for we were now in the mouth of ariver was sluggish before it turned so we floated quietly and beforethe moon went down managed to bail out the boat thoroughly and get hera little shipshape</s>  leo was sleeping profoundly and on the whole ithought it wise not to wake him</s>  it was true he was sleeping in wetclothes but the night was now so warm that i thought and so did jobthat they were not likely to injure a man of his unusually vigorousconstitution</s>  besides we had no dry ones at hand</s> presently the moon went down and left us floating on the waters nowonly heaving like some troubled womans breast with leisure to reflectupon all that we had gone through and all that we had escaped</s>  jobstationed himself at the bow mahomed kept his post at the tiller and isat on a seat in the middle of the boat close to where leo was lying</s> the moon went slowly down in chastened loveliness she departed likesome sweet bride into her chamber and long veillike shadows crept upthe sky through which the stars peeped shyly out</s>  soon however theytoo began to pale before a splendour in the east and then the quiveringfootsteps of the dawn came rushing across the newborn blue and shookthe high stars from their places</s>  quieter and yet more quiet grew thesea quiet as the soft mist that brooded on her bosom and covered upher troubling as the illusive wreaths of sleep brood upon a painrackedmind causing it to forget its sorrow</s>  from the east to the westsped the angels of the dawn from sea to sea from mountaintop tomountaintop scattering light with both their hands</s>  on they sped outof the darkness perfect glorious like spirits of the just breakingfrom the tomb on over the quiet sea over the low coastline and theswamps beyond and the mountains above them over those who slept inpeace and those who woke in sorrow over the evil and the good over theliving and the dead over the wide world and all that breathes or hasbreathed thereon</s> it was a wonderfully beautiful sight and yet sad perhaps from thevery excess of its beauty</s>
 there wehave the symbol and the type of humanity and all things with whichhumanity has to do</s>  the symbol and the type yes and the earthlybeginning and the end also</s>  and on that morning this came home to mewith a peculiar force</s>  the sun that rose today for us had set lastnight for eighteen of our fellowvoyagers</s> had set everlastingly foreighteen whom we knew</s> the dhow had gone down with them they were tossing about among therocks and seaweed so much human drift on the great ocean of death</s>  andwe four were saved</s>  but one day a sunrise will come when we shall beamong those who are lost and then others will watch those gloriousrays and grow sad in the midst of beauty and dream of death in thefull glow of arising life</s> for this is the lot of man</s> vthe head of the ethiopianat length the heralds and forerunners of the royal sun had done theirwork and searching out the shadows had caused them to flee away</s> then up he came in glory from his oceanbed and flooded the earthwith warmth and light</s>  i sat there in the boat listening to the gentlelapping of the water and watched him rise till presently the slightdrift of the boat brought the oddshaped rock or peak at the end ofthe promontory which we had weathered with so much peril between meand the majestic sight and blotted it from my view</s>  i still continuedhowever to stare at the rock absently enough till presently it becameedged with the fire of the growing light behind it and then i startedas well i might for i perceived that the top of the peak which wasabout eighty feet high by one hundred and fifty feet thick at its basewas shaped like a negros head and face whereon was stamped a mostfiendish and terrifying expression</s>  there was no doubt about it therewere the thick lips the fat cheeks and the squat nose standing outwith startling clearness against the flaming background</s>  there too wasthe round skull washed into shape perhaps by thousands of years ofwind and weather and to complete the resemblance there was a scrubbygrowth of weeds or lichen upon it which against the sun looked for allthe world like the wool on a colossal negros head</s>  it certainly wasvery odd so odd that now i believe it is not a mere freak of nature buta gigantic monument fashioned like the wellknown egyptian sphinx by aforgotten people out of a pile of rock that lent itself to theirdesign perhaps as an emblem of warning and defiance to any enemies whoapproached the harbour</s>  unfortunately we were never able to ascertainwhether or not this was the case inasmuch as the rock was difficult ofaccess both from the land and the waterside and we had other thingsto attend to</s>  myself considering the matter by the light of what weafterwards saw i believe that it was fashioned by man but whether ornot this is so there it stands and sullenly stares from age to age outacross the changing seathere it stood two thousand years and moreago when amenartas the egyptian princess and the wife of leos remoteancestor kallikrates gazed upon its devilish faceand there i have nodoubt it will still stand when as many centuries as are numbered betweenher day and our own are added to the year that bore us to oblivion</s> what do you think of that job</s>  i asked of our retainer who wassitting on the edge of the boat trying to get as much sunshine aspossible and generally looking uncommonly wretched and i pointed tothe fiery and demonical head</s> oh lord sir answered job who now perceived the object for the firsttime i think that the old geneleman must have been sitting for hisportrait on them rocks</s> i laughed and the laugh woke up leo</s> hullo he said whats the matter with me</s>  i am all stiffwhere isthe dhow</s>  give me some brandy please</s> you may be thankful that you are not stiffer my boy i answered</s>  thedhow is sunk everybody on board her is drowned with the exception ofus four and your own life was only saved by a miracle and whilst jobnow that it was light enough searched about in a locker for the brandyfor which leo asked i told him the history of our nights adventure</s> great heavens</s>  he said faintly and to think that we should have beenchosen to live through it</s> by this time the brandy was forthcoming and we all had a good pull atit and thankful enough we were for it</s>  also the sun was beginning toget strength and warm our chilled bones for we had been wet throughfor five hours or more</s> why said leo with a gasp as he put down the brandy bottle thereis the head the writing talks of the rock carven like the head of anethiopian</s> yes i said there it is</s> well then he answered the whole thing is true</s> i dont see at all that that follows i answered</s>  we knew this headwas here your father saw it</s>  very likely it is not the same head thatthe writing talks of or if it is it proves nothing</s> leo smiled at me in a superior way</s>  you are an unbelieving jew unclehorace he said</s>  those who live will see</s> exactly so i answered and now perhaps you will observe that we aredrifting across a sandbank into the mouth of the river</s>  get hold of youroar job and we will row in and see if we can find a place to land</s> the river mouth which we were entering did not appear to be a very wideone though as yet the long banks of steaming mist that clung aboutits shores had not lifted sufficiently to enable us to see its exactmeasure</s>  there was as is the case with nearly every east african rivera considerable bar at the mouth which no doubt when the wind was onshore and the tide running out was absolutely impassable even for aboat drawing only a few inches</s>  but as things were it was manageableenough and we did not ship a cupful of water</s>  in twenty minutes we werewell across it with but slight assistance from ourselves and beingcarried by a strong though somewhat variable breeze well up the harbour</s> by this time the mist was being sucked up by the sun which was gettinguncomfortably hot and we saw that the mouth of the little estuary washere about half a mile across and that the banks were very marshy andcrowded with crocodiles lying about on the mud like logs</s>  about a mileahead of us however was what appeared to be a strip of firm land andfor this we steered</s>  in another quarter of an hour we were there andmaking the boat fast to a beautiful tree with broad shining leaves andflowers of the magnolia species only they were rosecoloured andnot white which hung over the water we disembarked</s>  this done weundressed washed ourselves and spread our clothes together with thecontents of the boat in the sun to dry which they very quickly did</s> then taking shelter from the sun under some trees we made a heartybreakfast off a paysandu potted tongue of which we had brought a goodquantity with us congratulating ourselves loudly on our good fortunein having loaded and provisioned the boat on the previous day before thehurricane destroyed the dhow</s>  by the time that we had finished our mealour clothes were quite dry and we hastened to get into them feelingnot a little refreshed</s>  indeed with the exception of weariness anda few bruises none of us were the worse for the terrifying adventurewhich had been fatal to all our companions</s>  leo it is true had beenhalfdrowned but that is no great matter to a vigorous young athlete offiveandtwenty</s>    there is a known species of magnolia with pink flowers</s>   it is indigenous in sikkim and known as magnolia  campbellii</s> editor</s> after breakfast we started to look about us</s>  we were on a strip of dryland about two hundred yards broad by five hundred long bordered on oneside by the river and on the other three by endless desolate swampsthat stretched as far as the eye could reach</s>  this strip of land wasraised about twentyfive feet above the plain of the surrounding swampsand the river level indeed it had every appearance of having been madeby the hand of man</s> this place has been a wharf said leo dogmatically</s> nonsense i answered</s>  who would be stupid enough to build a wharfin the middle of these dreadful marshes in a country inhabited bysavagesthat is if it is inhabited at all</s> perhaps it was not always marsh and perhaps the people were notalways savage he said drily looking down the steep bank for we werestanding by the river</s>  look there he went on pointing to a spotwhere the hurricane of the previous night had torn up one of themagnolia trees by the roots which had grown on the extreme edge of thebank just where it sloped down to the water and lifted a large cake ofearth with them</s>  is not that stonework</s>  if not it is very like it</s> nonsense i said again but we clambered down to the spot and gotbetween the upturned roots and the bank</s> well</s>  he said</s> but i did not answer this time</s>  i only whistled</s>  for there laid bare bythe removal of the earth was an undoubted facing of solid stone laid inlarge blocks and bound together with brown cement so hard that i couldmake no impression on it with the file in my shootingknife</s>  nor wasthis all seeing something projecting through the soil at the bottom ofthe bared patch of walling i removed the loose earth with my hands andrevealed a huge stone ring a foot or more in diameter and about threeinches thick</s>  this fairly staggered me</s> looks rather like a wharf where goodsized vessels have been mooreddoes it not uncle horace</s>  said leo with an excited grin</s> i tried to say nonsense again but the word stuck in my throatthering spoke for itself</s>  in some past age vessels had been moored thereand this stone wall was undoubtedly the remnant of a solidly constructedwharf</s>  probably the city to which it had belonged lay buried beneath theswamp behind it</s> begins to look as though there were something in the story after alluncle horace said the exultant leo and reflecting on the mysteriousnegros head and the equally mysterious stonework i made no directreply</s> a country like africa i said is sure to be full of the relicsof long dead and forgotten civilisations</s>  nobody knows the age of theegyptian civilisation and very likely it had offshoots</s>  then there werethe babylonians and the phnicians and the persians and all mannerof people all more or less civilised to say nothing of the jews whomeverybody wants nowadays</s>  it is possible that they or any one ofthem may have had colonies or trading stations about here</s>  rememberthose buried persian cities that the consul showed us at kilwa</s>  near kilwa on the east coast of africa about 400 miles south ofzanzibar is a cliff which has been recently washed by the waves</s>  on thetop of this cliff are persian tombs known to be at least seven centuriesold by the dates still legible upon them</s>  beneath these tombs is a layerof dbris representing a city</s>  farther down the cliff is a secondlayer representing an older city and farther down still a third layerthe remains of yet another city of vast and unknown antiquity</s> beneath the bottom city were recently found some specimens of glazedearthenware such as are occasionally to be met with on that coast tothis day</s>  i believe that they are now in the possession of sir johnkirk</s> editor</s> quite so said leo but that is not what you said before</s> well what is to be done now</s>  i asked turning the conversation</s> as no answer was forthcoming we walked to the edge of the swamp andlooked over it</s>  it was apparently boundless and vast flocks ofevery sort of waterfowl flew from its recesses till it was sometimesdifficult to see the sky</s>  now that the sun was getting high it drew thinsickly looking clouds of poisonous vapour from the surface of the marshand from the scummy pools of stagnant water</s> two things are clear to me i said addressing my three companionswho stared at this spectacle in dismay first that we cant go acrossthere i pointed to the swamp and secondly that if we stop here weshall certainly die of fever</s> thats as clear as a haystack sir said job</s> very well then there are two alternatives before us</s>  one is to boutship and try and run for some port in the whaleboat which would bea sufficiently risky proceeding and the other to sail or row on up theriver and see where we come to</s> i dont know what you are going to do said leo setting his mouthbut i am going up that river</s> job turned up the whites of his eyes and groaned and the arab murmuredallah and groaned also</s>  as for me i remarked sweetly that as weseemed to be between the devil and the deep sea it did not much matterwhere we went</s>  but in reality i was as anxious to proceed as leo</s>  thecolossal negros head and the stone wharf had excited my curiosity to anextent of which i was secretly ashamed and i was prepared to gratify itat any cost</s>  accordingly having carefully fitted the mast restowedthe boat and got out our rifles we embarked</s>  fortunately the windwas blowing on shore from the ocean so we were able to hoist the sail</s> indeed we afterwards found out that as a general rule the wind set onshore from daybreak for some hours and off shore again at sunset andthe explanation that i offer of this is that when the earth is cooledby the dew and the night the hot air rises and the draught rushes infrom the sea till the sun has once more heated it through</s>  at least thatappeared to be the rule here</s> taking advantage of this favouring wind we sailed merrily up the riverfor three or four hours</s>  once we came across a school of hippopotamiwhich rose and bellowed dreadfully at us within ten or a dozen fathomsof the boat much to jobs alarm and i will confess to my own</s>  thesewere the first hippopotami that we had ever seen and to judge by theirinsatiable curiosity i should judge that we were the first white menthat they had ever seen</s>  upon my word i once or twice thought that theywere coming into the boat to gratify it</s>  leo wanted to fire at thembut i dissuaded him fearing the consequences</s>  also we saw hundreds ofcrocodiles basking on the muddy banks and thousands upon thousandsof waterfowl</s>  some of these we shot and among them was a wild goosewhich in addition to the sharpcurved spurs on its wings had a spurabout threequarters of an inch long growing from the skull just betweenthe eyes</s>  we never shot another like it so i do not know if it wasa sport or a distinct species</s>  in the latter case this incident mayinterest naturalists</s>  job named it the unicorn goose</s> about midday the sun grew intensely hot and the stench drawn up by itfrom the marshes which the river drains was something too awful andcaused us instantly to swallow precautionary doses of quinine</s>  shortlyafterwards the breeze died away altogether and as rowing our heavy boatagainst stream in the heat was out of the question we were thankfulenough to get under the shade of a group of treesa species ofwillowthat grew by the edge of the river and lie there and gasp tillat length the approach of sunset put a period to our miseries</s>  seeingwhat appeared to be an open space of water straight ahead of us wedetermined to row there before settling what to do for the night</s>  justas we were about to loosen the boat however a beautiful waterbuckwith great horns curving forward and a white stripe across the rumpcame down to the river to drink without perceiving us hidden awaywithin fifty yards under the willows</s>  leo was the first to catch sightof it and being an ardent sportsman thirsting for the blood ofbig game about which he had been dreaming for months he instantlystiffened all over and pointed like a setter dog</s>  seeing what was thematter i handed him his express rifle at the same time taking my own</s> now then i whispered mind you dont miss</s> miss</s>  he whispered back contemptuously i could not miss it if itried</s> he lifted the rifle and the roancoloured buck having drunk his fillraised his head and looked out across the river</s>  he was standing rightagainst the sunset sky on a little eminence or ridge of ground whichran across the swamp evidently a favourite path for game and therewas something very beautiful about him</s>  indeed i do not think that ifi live to a hundred i shall ever forget that desolate and yet mostfascinating scene it is stamped upon my memory</s>  to the right andleft were wide stretches of lonely deathbreeding swamp unbroken andunrelieved so far as the eye could reach except here and there by pondsof black and peaty water that mirrorlike flashed up the red raysof the setting sun</s>  behind us and before stretched the vista of thesluggish river ending in glimpses of a reedfringed lagoon on thesurface of which the long lights of the evening played as the faintbreeze stirred the shadows</s>  to the west loomed the huge red ball of thesinking sun now vanishing down the vapoury horizon and filling thegreat heaven high across whose arch the cranes and wildfowl streamedin line square and triangle with flashes of flying gold and the luridstain of blood</s>  and then ourselvesthree modern englishmen in amodern english boatseeming to jar upon and look out of tone with thatmeasureless desolation and in front of us the noble buck limned outupon a background of ruddy sky</s> bang</s>  away he goes with a mighty bound</s>  leo has missed him</s>  bang</s> right under him again</s>  now for a shot</s>  i must have one though he isgoing like an arrow and a hundred yards away and more</s>  by jove</s>  overand over and over</s>  well i think ive wiped your eye there masterleo i say struggling against the ungenerous exultation that in sucha supreme moment of ones existence will rise in the bestmanneredsportsmans breast</s> confound you yes growled leo and then with that quick smile thatis one of his charms lighting up his handsome face like a ray of lighti beg your pardon old fellow</s>  i congratulate you it was a lovelyshot and mine were vile</s> we got out of the boat and ran to the buck which was shot through thespine and stone dead</s>  it took us a quarter of an hour or more to cleanit and cut off as much of the best meat as we could carry andhaving packed this away we had barely light enough to row up into thelagoonlike space into which there being a hollow in the swamp theriver here expanded</s>  just as the light vanished we cast anchor aboutthirty fathoms from the edge of the lake</s>  we did not dare to go ashorenot knowing if we should find dry ground to camp on and greatly fearingthe poisonous exhalations from the marsh from which we thought weshould be freer on the water</s>  so we lighted a lantern and made ourevening meal off another potted tongue in the best fashion that wecould and then prepared to go to sleep only however to find thatsleep was impossible</s>  for whether they were attracted by the lanternor by the unaccustomed smell of a white man for which they had beenwaiting for the last thousand years or so i know not but certainly wewere presently attacked by tens of thousands of the most bloodthirstypertinacious and huge mosquitoes that i ever saw or read of</s>  in cloudsthey came and pinged and buzzed and bit till we were nearly mad</s> tobacco smoke only seemed to stir them into a merrier and more activelife till at length we were driven to covering ourselves with blanketshead and all and sitting to slowly stew and continually scratch andswear beneath them</s>  and as we sat suddenly rolling out like thunderthrough the silence came the deep roar of a lion and then of a secondlion moving among the reeds within sixty yards of us</s> i say said leo sticking his head out from under his blanket luckywe aint on the bank eh avuncular</s>  leo sometimes addressed me inthis disrespectful way</s>  curse it</s>  a mosquito has bitten me on thenose and the head vanished again</s> shortly after this the moon came up and notwithstanding every varietyof roar that echoed over the water to us from the lions on the banks webegan thinking ourselves perfectly secure to gradually doze off</s> i do not quite know what it was that made me poke my head out of thefriendly shelter of the blanket perhaps because i found that themosquitoes were biting right through it</s>  anyhow as i did so i heard jobwhisper in a frightened voiceoh my stars look there</s> instantly we all of us looked and this was what we saw in themoonlight</s>  near the shore were two wide and everwidening circles ofconcentric rings rippling away across the surface of the water and inthe heart and centre of the circles were two dark moving objects</s> what is it</s>  asked i</s> it is those damned lions sir answered job in a tone which wasan odd mixture of a sense of personal injury habitual respect andacknowledged fear and they are swimming here to heat us he addednervously picking up an h in his agitation</s> i looked again there was no doubt about it i could catch the glare oftheir ferocious eyes</s>  attracted either by the smell of the newly killedwaterbuck meat or of ourselves the hungry beasts were actually stormingour position</s> leo already had his rifle in his hand</s>  i called to him to wait till theywere nearer and meanwhile grabbed my own</s>  some fifteen feet from usthe water shallowed on a bank to the depth of about fifteen inches andpresently the first of themit was the lionessgot on to it shookherself and roared</s>  at that moment leo fired the bullet went rightdown her open mouth and out at the back of her neck and down shedropped with a splash dead</s>  the other liona fullgrown malewassome two paces behind her</s>  at this second he got his forepaws on to thebank when a strange thing happened</s>  there was a rush and disturbanceof the water such as one sees in a pond in england when a pike takes alittle fish only a thousand times fiercer and larger and suddenly thelion gave a most terrific snarling roar and sprang forward on to thebank dragging something black with him</s> allah</s>  shouted mahomed a crocodile has got him by the leg</s>  and sureenough he had</s>  we could see the long snout with its gleaming lines ofteeth and the reptile body behind it</s> and then followed an extraordinary scene indeed</s>  the lion managed toget well on to the bank the crocodile half standing and half swimmingstill nipping his hind leg</s>  he roared till the air quivered with thesound and then with a savage shrieking snarl turned round and clawedhold of the crocodiles head</s>  the crocodile shifted his grip havingas we afterwards discovered had one of his eyes torn out and slightlyturned over instantly the lion got him by the throat and held on andthen over and over they rolled upon the bank struggling hideously</s>  itwas impossible to follow their movements but when next we got a clearview the tables had turned for the crocodile whose head seemed to bea mass of gore had got the lions body in his iron jaws just above thehips and was squeezing him and shaking him to and fro</s>  for his partthe tortured brute roaring in agony was clawing and biting madlyat his enemys scaly head and fixing his great hind claws in thecrocodiles comparatively speaking soft throat ripping it open as onewould rip a glove</s> then all of a sudden the end came</s>  the lions head fell forward on thecrocodiles back and with an awful groan he died and the crocodileafter standing for a minute motionless slowly rolled over on to hisside his jaws still fixed across the carcase of the lion which weafterwards found he had bitten almost in halves</s> this duel to the death was a wonderful and a shocking sight and onethat i suppose few men have seenand thus it ended</s> when it was all over leaving mahomed to keep a look out we managed tospend the rest of the night as quietly as the mosquitoes would allow</s> vian early christian ceremonynext morning at the earliest light of dawn we rose performed suchablutions as circumstances would allow and generally made ready tostart</s>  i am bound to say that when there was sufficient light to enableus to see each others faces i for one burst out into a roar oflaughter</s>  jobs fat and comfortable countenance was swollen out tonearly twice its natural size from mosquito bites and leos conditionwas not much better</s>  indeed of the three i had come off much the bestprobably owing to the toughness of my dark skin and to the fact thata good deal of it was covered by hair for since we had started fromengland i had allowed my naturally luxuriant beard to grow at itsown sweet will</s>  but the other two were comparatively speaking cleanshaved which of course gave the enemy a larger extent of open countryto operate on though in mahomeds case the mosquitoes recognising thetaste of a true believer would not touch him at any price</s>  how ofteni wonder during the next week or so did we wish that we were flavouredlike an arab</s> by the time that we had done laughing as heartily as our swollen lipswould allow it was daylight and the morning breeze was coming up fromthe sea cutting lanes through the dense marsh mists and here and thererolling them before it in great balls of fleecy vapour</s>  so we setour sail and having first taken a look at the two dead lions and thealligator which we were of course unable to skin being destitute ofmeans of curing the pelts we started and sailing through the lagoonfollowed the course of the river on the farther side</s>  at midday whenthe breeze dropped we were fortunate enough to find a convenient pieceof dry land on which to camp and light a fire and here we cooked twowildducks and some of the waterbucks fleshnot in a very appetisingway it is true but still sufficiently</s>  the rest of the bucks fleshwe cut into strips and hung in the sun to dry into biltong as ibelieve the south african dutch call flesh thus prepared</s>  on thiswelcome patch of dry land we stopped till the following dawn and asbefore spent the night in warfare with the mosquitoes but withoutother troubles</s>  the next day or two passed in similar fashion andwithout noticeable adventures except that we shot a specimen of apeculiarly graceful hornless buck and saw many varieties of waterlilyin full bloom some of them blue and of exquisite beauty though fewof the flowers were perfect owing to the prevalence of a whitewatermaggot with a green head that fed upon them</s> it was on the fifth day of our journey when we had travelled so faras we could reckon about one hundred and thirtyfive to a hundred andforty miles westwards from the coast that the first event of any realimportance occurred</s>  on that morning the usual wind failed us abouteleven oclock and after pulling a little way we were forced to haltmore or less exhausted at what appeared to be the junction of ourstream with another of a uniform width of about fifty feet</s>  some treesgrew near at handthe only trees in all this country were along thebanks of the river and under these we rested and then the land beingfairly dry just here walked a little way along the edge of the river toprospect and shoot a few waterfowl for food</s>  before we had gone fiftyyards we perceived that all hopes of getting further up the stream inthe whaleboat were at an end for not two hundred yards above wherewe had stopped were a succession of shallows and mudbanks with not sixinches of water over them</s>  it was a watery cul de sac</s> turning back we walked some way along the banks of the other river andsoon came to the conclusion from various indications that it was nota river at all but an ancient canal like the one which is to be seenabove mombasa on the zanzibar coast connecting the tana river withthe ozy in such a way as to enable the shipping coming down the tanato cross to the ozy and reach the sea by it and thus avoid the verydangerous bar that blocks the mouth of the tana</s>  the canal before ushad evidently been dug out by man at some remote period of the worldshistory and the results of his digging still remained in the shape ofthe raised banks that had no doubt once formed towingpaths</s>  except hereand there where they had been hollowed out by the water or fallen inthese banks of stiff binding clay were at a uniform distance from eachother and the depth of the stream also appeared to be uniform</s>  currentthere was little or none and as a consequence the surface of thecanal was choked with vegetable growth intersected by little pathsof clear water made i suppose by the constant passage of waterfowliguanas and other vermin</s>  now as it was evident that we could notproceed up the river it became equally evident that we must either trythe canal or else return to the sea</s>  we could not stop where we wereto be baked by the sun and eaten up by the mosquitoes till we died offever in that dreary marsh</s> well i suppose that we must try it i said and the others assentedin their various waysleo as though it were the best joke in theworld job in respectful disgust and mahomed with an invocation tothe prophet and a comprehensive curse upon all unbelievers and theirways of thought and travel</s> accordingly as soon as the sun got low having little or nothing moreto hope for from our friendly wind we started</s>  for the first hour or sowe managed to row the boat though with great labour but after that theweeds got too thick to allow of it and we were obliged to resort to theprimitive and most exhausting resource of towing her</s>  for two hours welaboured mahomed job and i who was supposed to be strong enough topull against the two of them on the bank while leo sat in the bow ofthe boat and brushed away the weeds which collected round the cutwaterwith mahomeds sword</s>  at dark we halted for some hours to rest and enjoythe mosquitoes but about midnight we went on again taking advantageof the comparative cool of the night</s>  at dawn we rested for three hoursand then started once more and laboured on till about ten oclock whena thunderstorm accompanied by a deluge of rain overtook us and wespent the next six hours practically under water</s> i do not know that there is any necessity for me to describe the nextfour days of our voyage in detail further than to say that they wereon the whole the most miserable that i ever spent in my life formingone monotonous record of heavy labour heat misery and mosquitoes</s>  allthat dreary way we passed through a region of almost endless swamp andi can only attribute our escape from fever and death to the constantdoses of quinine and purgatives which we took and the unceasing toilwhich we were forced to undergo</s>  on the third day of our journey up thecanal we had sighted a round hill that loomed dimly through the vapoursof the marsh and on the evening of the fourth night when we campedthis hill seemed to be within fiveandtwenty or thirty miles of us</s>  wewere by now utterly exhausted and felt as though our blistered handscould not pull the boat a yard farther and that the best thing thatwe could do would be to lie down and die in that dreadful wilderness ofswamp</s>  it was an awful position and one in which i trust no other whiteman will ever be placed and as i threw myself down in the boat to sleepthe sleep of utter exhaustion i bitterly cursed my folly in ever havingbeen a party to such a mad undertaking which could i saw only end inour death in this ghastly land</s>  i thought i remember as i slowly sankinto a doze of what the appearance of the boat and her unhappy crewwould be in two or three months time from that night</s>  there she wouldlie with gaping seams and half filled with ftid water which whenthe mistladen wind stirred her would wash backwards and forwardsthrough our mouldering bones and that would be the end of her and ofthose in her who would follow after myths and seek out the secrets ofnature</s> already i seemed to hear the water rippling against the desiccated bonesand rattling them together rolling my skull against mahomeds andhis against mine till at last mahomeds stood straight up upon itsvertebr and glared at me through its empty eyeholes and cursed mewith its grinning jaws because i a dog of a christian disturbed thelast sleep of a true believer</s>  i opened my eyes and shuddered at thehorrid dream and then shuddered again at something that was not adream for two great eyes were gleaming down at me through the mistydarkness</s>  i struggled up and in my terror and confusion shrieked andshrieked again so that the others sprang up too reeling and drunkenwith sleep and fear</s>  and then all of a sudden there was a flash of coldsteel and a great spear was held against my throat and behind it otherspears gleamed cruelly</s> peace said a voice speaking in arabic or rather in some dialectinto which arabic entered very largely who are ye who come hitherswimming on the water</s>  speak or ye die and the steel pressed sharplyagainst my throat sending a cold chill through me</s> we are travellers and have come hither by chance i answered in mybest arabic which appeared to be understood for the man turned hishead and addressing a tall form that towered up in the

a company of some fifty men</s>  in that light alli could make out was that they were armed with huge spears were verytall and strongly built comparatively light in colour and nude savefor a leopard

said leo it is a blessing to find anybody to carry us afterhaving to carry ourselves so long</s> leo always takes a cheerful view of things</s> there being no help for it after seeing the others into

swinging trot</s>  for half anhour or so i lay still reflecting on the very remarkable experiencesthat we were going through and wondering if any of my eminentlyrespectable fossil friends down at cambridge would believe me if i wereto be miraculously set at the familiar dinnertable for the purposeof relating them</s>  i do not want to convey any disrespectful notion orslight when i call those good and learned men fossils but my experienceis that people are apt to fossilise even at a university if they followthe same paths too persistently</s>  i was getting fossilised myself butof late my

slept for seven or eight hours getting the firstreal rest that i had had since the night before the loss of thedhow for when i woke the sun was high in the heavens</s>  we were stilljourneying on at a pace of about four miles an hour</s>  peeping out throughthe mistlike curtains of the litter which were ingeniously fixed tothe bearing pole i perceived to my infinite relief that we had passedout of the region of eternal swamp and were now travelling overswelling grassy plains towards a cupshaped hill</s>  whether or not it wasthe same hill that we had seen from the canal i do not know and

frizzed up but hungin thick black locks upon their shoulders</s>  their features were aquilineand in many cases exceedingly handsome the teeth being especiallyregular and beautiful</s>  but notwithstanding their beauty it struck methat on the whole i had never seen a more evillooking set of faces</s> there was an aspect of cold and sullen cruelty stamped upon themthat revolted me and which in some cases was almost uncanny in itsintensity</s> another thing that struck me about them was that they never seemed tosmile</s>  sometimes they sang the monotonous song of which i have spokenbut when they were not singing they remained almost perfectly silentand the light of a laugh never came to brighten their sombre and evilcountenances</s>  of what race could these people be</s>  their language was abastard arabic and yet they were not arabs i was quite sure of that</s> for one thing they were too dark or rather yellow</s>  i could not say whybut i know that their appearance filled me with a sick fear of whichi felt ashamed</s>  while i was still wondering another litter came upalongside of mine</s>  in itfor the curtains were drawnsat an old manclothed in a whitish robe made apparently from coarse linen that hungloosely about him who i at once jumped to the conclusion wasthe shadowy figure that had stood on the bank and been addressed asfather</s>  he was a wonderfullooking old man with a snowy beard solong that the ends of it hung over the sides of the litter and he hada hooked nose above which flashed out a pair of eyes as keen as asnakes while his whole countenance was instinct with a look of wiseand sardonic humour impossible to describe on paper</s> art thou awake stranger</s>  he said in a deep and low voice</s> surely my father i answered courteously feeling certain that ishould do well to conciliate this ancient mammon of unrighteousness</s> he stroked his beautiful white beard and smiled faintly</s> from whatever country thou camest he said and by the way it mustbe from one where somewhat of our language is known they teach theirchildren courtesy there my stranger son</s>  and now wherefore comest thouunto this land which scarce an alien foot has pressed from the timethat man knoweth</s>  art thou and those with thee weary of life</s> we came to find new things i answered boldly</s>  we are tired ofthe old things we have come up out of the sea to know that whichis unknown</s>  we are of a brave race who fear not death my very muchrespected fatherthat is if we can get a little information before wedie</s> humph</s>  said the old gentleman that may be true it is rash tocontradict otherwise i should say that thou wast lying my son</s> however i dare to say that shewhomustbeobeyed will meet thywishes in the matter</s> who is shewhomustbeobeyed</s>  i asked curiously</s> the old man glanced at the bearers and then answered with a littlesmile that somehow sent my blood to my heartsurely my stranger son thou wilt learn soon enough if it be herpleasure to see thee at all in the flesh</s> in the flesh</s>  i answered</s>  what may my father wish to convey</s> but the old man only laughed a dreadful laugh and made no reply</s>
what is the name of my fathers people</s>  i asked</s> the name of my people is amahagger the people of the rocks</s> and if a son might ask what is the name of my father</s> my name is billali</s>
and whither go we my father</s> that shalt thou see and at a sign from him his bearers startedforward at a run till they reached the litter in which job was reposingwith one leg hanging over the side</s>  apparently however he could notmake much out of job for presently i saw his bearers trot forward toleos litter</s> and after that as nothing fresh occurred i yielded to the pleasantswaying motion of the litter and went to sleep again</s>  i was dreadfullytired</s>  when i woke i found that we were passing through a rocky defileof a lava formation with precipitous sides in which grew many beautifultrees and flowering shrubs</s> presently this defile took a turn and a lovely sight unfolded itselfto my eyes</s>  before us was a vast cup of green from four to six miles inextent in the shape of a roman amphitheatre</s>  the sides of this greatcup were rocky and clothed with bush but the centre was of the richestmeadow land studded with single trees of magnificent growth andwatered by meandering brooks</s>  on this rich plain grazed herds of goatsand cattle but i saw no sheep</s>  at first i could not imagine what thisstrange spot could be but presently it flashed upon me that it mustrepresent the crater of some longextinct volcano which had afterwardsbeen a lake and was ultimately drained in some unexplained way</s>  andhere i may state that from my subsequent experience of this and a muchlarger but otherwise similar spot which i shall have occasion todescribe byandby i have every reason to believe that this conclusionwas correct</s>  what puzzled me however was that although there werepeople moving about herding the goats and cattle i saw no signs of anyhuman habitation</s>  where did they all live</s>  i wondered</s>  my curiosity wassoon destined to be gratified</s>  turning to the left the string of littersfollowed the cliffy sides of the crater for a distance of about halfa mile or perhaps a little less and then halted</s>  seeing the oldgentleman my adopted father billali emerge from his litter i didthe same and so did leo and job</s>  the first thing i saw was our wretchedarab companion mahomed lying exhausted on the ground</s>  it appeared thathe had not been provided with a litter but had been forced to run theentire distance and as he was already quite worn out when we startedhis condition now was one of great prostration</s> on looking round we discovered that the place where we had halted wasa platform in front of the mouth of a great cave and piled upon thisplatform were the entire contents of the whaleboat even down to theoars and sail</s>  round the cave stood groups of the men who had escortedus and other men of a similar stamp</s>  they were all tall and allhandsome though they varied in their degree of darkness of skin somebeing as dark as mahomed and some as yellow as a chinese</s>  they werenaked except for the leopardskin round the waist and each of themcarried a huge spear</s> there were also some women among them who instead of the leopardskinwore a tanned hide of a small red buck something like that of theorib only rather darker in colour</s>  these women were as a classexceedingly goodlooking with large dark eyes wellcut features anda thick bush of curling hairnot crisped like a negrosranging fromblack to chestnut in hue with all shades of intermediate colour</s>  somebut very few of them wore a yellowish linen garment such as i havedescribed as worn by billali but this as we afterwards discovered wasa mark of rank rather than an attempt at clothing</s>  for the rest theirappearance was not quite so terrifying as that of the men and theysometimes though rarely smiled</s>  as soon as we had alighted theygathered round us and examined us with curiosity but withoutexcitement</s>  leos tall athletic form and clearcut grecian facehowever evidently excited their attention and when he politely liftedhis hat to them and showed his curling yellow hair there was a slightmurmur of admiration</s>  nor did it stop there for after regarding himcritically from head to foot the handsomest of the young womenonewearing a robe and with hair of a shade between brown andchestnutdeliberately advanced to him and in a way that would havebeen winning had it not been so determined quietly put her arm roundhis neck bent forward and kissed him on the lips</s> i gave a gasp expecting to see leo instantly speared and jobejaculated the hussywell i never</s>  as for leo he looked slightlyastonished and then remarking that we had clearly got into a countrywhere they followed the customs of the early christians deliberatelyreturned the embrace</s> again i gasped thinking that something would happen but to mysurprise though some of the young women showed traces of vexation theolder ones and the men only smiled slightly</s>  when we came to understandthe customs of this extraordinary people the mystery was explained</s>  itthen appeared that in direct opposition to the habits of almost everyother savage race in the world women among the amahagger are not onlyupon terms of perfect equality with the men but are not held to them byany binding ties</s>  descent is traced only through the line of themother and while individuals are as proud of a long and superior femaleancestry as we are of our families in europe they never pay attentionto or even acknowledge any man as their father even when their maleparentage is perfectly well known</s>  there is but one titular male parentof each tribe or as they call it household and he is its electedand immediate ruler with the title of father</s>  for instance the manbillali was the father of this household which consisted of aboutseven thousand individuals all told and no other man was ever calledby that name</s>  when a woman took a fancy to a man she signified herpreference by advancing and embracing him publicly in the same way thatthis handsome and exceedingly prompt young lady who was called ustanehad embraced leo</s>  if he kissed her back it was a token that he acceptedher and the arrangement continued until one of them wearied of it</s>  iam bound however to say that the change of husbands was not nearly sofrequently as might have been expected</s>  nor did quarrels arise outof it at least among the men who when their wives deserted themin favour of a rival accepted the whole thing much as we accept theincometax or our marriage laws as something not to be disputed and astending to the good of the community however disagreeable they may inparticular instances prove to the individual</s> it is very curious to observe how the customs of mankind on this mattervary in different countries making morality an affair of latitude andwhat is right and proper in one place wrong and improper in another</s>  itmust however be understood that since all civilised nations appear toaccept it as an axiom that ceremony is the touchstone of morality thereis even according to our canons nothing immoral about this amahaggercustom seeing that the interchange of the embrace answers to ourceremony of marriage which as we know justifies most things</s> viiustane singswhen the kissing operation was finishedby the way none of the youngladies offered to pet me in this fashion though i saw one hoveringround job to that respectable individuals evident alarmthe old manbillali advanced and graciously waved us into the cave whither wewent followed by ustane who did not seem inclined to take the hints igave her that we liked privacy</s> before we had gone five paces it struck me that the cave that we wereentering was none of natures handiwork but on the contrary had beenhollowed by the hand of man</s>  so far as we could judge it appeared tobe about one hundred feet in length by fifty wide and very loftyresembling a cathedral aisle more than anything else</s>  from this mainaisle opened passages at a distance of every twelve or fifteen feetleading i supposed to smaller chambers</s>  about fifty feet from theentrance of the cave just where the light began to get dim a fire wasburning which threw huge shadows upon the gloomy walls around</s>  herebillali halted and asked us to be seated saying that the people wouldbring us food and accordingly we squatted ourselves down upon therugs of skins which were spread for us and waited</s>  presently the foodconsisting of goats flesh boiled fresh milk in an earthenware pot andboiled cobs of indian corn was brought by young girls</s>  we were almoststarving and i do not think that i ever in my life before ate withsuch satisfaction</s>  indeed before we had finished we literally ate upeverything that was set before us</s> when we had done our somewhat saturnine host billali who had beenwatching us in perfect silence rose and addressed us</s>  he said that itwas a wonderful thing that had happened</s>  no man had ever known or heardof white strangers arriving in the country of the people of the rocks</s> sometimes though rarely black men had come here and from them theyhad heard of the existence of men much whiter than themselves whosailed on the sea in ships but for the arrival of such there was noprecedent</s>  we had however been seen dragging the boat up the canaland he told us frankly that he had at once given orders for ourdestruction seeing that it was unlawful for any stranger to enter herewhen a message had come from shewhomustbeobeyed saying that ourlives were to be spared and that we were to be brought hither</s> pardon me my father i interrupted at this point but if as iunderstand shewhomustbeobeyed lives yet farther off how couldshe have known of our approach</s> billali turned and seeing that we were alonefor the young ladyustane had withdrawn when he had begun to speaksaid with a curiouslittle laughare there none in your land who can see without eyes and hear withoutears</s>  ask no questions she knew</s> i shrugged my shoulders at this and he proceeded to say that no furtherinstructions had been received on the subject of our disposal and thisbeing so he was about to start to interview shewhomustbeobeyedgenerally spoken of for the sake of brevity as hiya or she simplywho he gave us to understand was the queen of the amahagger and learnher wishes</s> i asked him how long he proposed to be away and he said that bytravelling hard he might be back on the fifth day but there were manymiles of marsh to cross before he came to where she was</s>  he then saidthat every arrangement would be made for our comfort during his absenceand that as he personally had taken a fancy to us he sincerely trustedthat the answer he should bring from she would be one favourable tothe continuation of our existence but at the same time he did not wishto conceal from us that he thought this doubtful as every strangerwho had ever come into the country during his grandmothers life hismothers life and his own life had been put to death without mercyand in a way he would not harrow our feelings by describing and thishad been done by the order of she herself at least he supposed thatit was by her order</s>  at any rate she never interfered to save them</s> why i said but how can that be</s>  you are an old man and the timeyou talk of must reach back three mens lives</s>  how therefore could shehave ordered the death of anybody at the beginning of the life of yourgrandmother seeing that herself she would not have been born</s> again he smiledthat same faint peculiar smile and with a deep bowdeparted without making any answer nor did we see him again for fivedays</s> when he had gone we discussed the situation which filled me withalarm</s>  i did not at all like the accounts of this mysterious queenshewhomustbeobeyed or more shortly she who apparentlyordered the execution of any unfortunate stranger in a fashion sounmerciful</s>  leo too was depressed about it but consoled himself bytriumphantly pointing out that this she was undoubtedly the personreferred to in the writing on the potsherd and in his fathers letterin proof of which he advanced billalis allusions to her age and power</s> i was by this time too overwhelmed with the whole course of events thati had not even the heart left to dispute a proposition so absurd so isuggested that we should try to go out and get a bath of which we allstood sadly in need</s> accordingly having indicated our wish to a middleaged individual ofan unusually saturnine cast of countenance even among this saturninepeople who appeared to be deputed to look after us now that the fatherof the hamlet had departed we started in a bodyhaving first litour pipes</s>  outside the cave we found quite a crowd of people evidentlywatching for our appearance but when they saw us come out smoking theyvanished this way and that calling out that we were great magicians</s> indeed nothing about us created so great a sensation as our tobaccosmokenot even our firearms</s>  after this we succeeded in reachinga stream that had its source in a strong ground spring and taking ourbath in peace though some of the women not excepting ustane showed adecided inclination to follow us even there</s>    we found tobacco growing in this country as it does in  every other part of africa and although they were so  absolutely ignorant of its other blessed qualities the  amahagger use it habitually in the form of snuff and also  for medicinal purposes</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> by the time that we had finished this most refreshing bath the sun wassetting indeed when we got back to the big cave it had already set</s> the cave itself was full of people gathered round firesfor severalmore had now been lightedand eating their evening meal by their luridlight and by that of various lamps which were set about or hung uponthe walls</s>  these lamps were of a rude manufacture of baked earthenwareand of all shapes some of them graceful enough</s>  the larger ones wereformed of big red earthenware pots filled with clarified melted fatand having a reed wick stuck through a wooden disk which filled the topof the pot</s>  this sort of lamp required the most constant attention toprevent its going out whenever the wick burnt down as there were nomeans of turning it up</s>  the smaller hand lamps however which were alsomade of baked clay were fitted with wicks manufactured from the pithof a palmtree or sometimes from the stem of a very handsome varietyof fern</s>  this kind of wick was passed through a round hole at the end ofthe lamp to which a sharp piece of hard wood was attached wherewith topierce and draw it up whenever it showed signs of burning low</s> for a while we sat down and watched this grim people eating theirevening meal in silence as grim as themselves till at length gettingtired of contemplating them and the huge moving shadows on the rockywalls i suggested to our new keeper that we should like to go to bed</s> without a word he rose and taking me politely by the hand advancedwith a lamp to one of the small passages that i had noticed openingout of the central cave</s>  this we followed for about five paces when itsuddenly widened out into a small chamber about eight feet square andhewn out of the living rock</s>  on one side of this chamber was a stoneslab about three feet from the ground and running its entire lengthlike a bunk in a cabin and on this slab he intimated that i was tosleep</s>  there was no window or airhole to the chamber and no furnitureand on looking at it more closely i came to the disturbing conclusionin which as i afterwards discovered i was quite right that ithad originally served for a sepulchre for the dead rather than asleepingplace for the living the slab being designed to receive thecorpse of the departed</s>  the thought made me shudder in spite of myselfbut seeing that i must sleep somewhere i got over the feeling as besti might and returned to the cavern to get my blanket which had beenbrought up from the boat with the other things</s>  there i met job whohaving been inducted to a similar apartment had flatly declined to stopin it saying that the look of the place gave him the horrors and thathe might as well be dead and buried in his grandfathers brick graveat once and expressed his determination of sleeping with me if i wouldallow him</s>  this of course i was only too glad to do</s> the night passed very comfortably on the whole</s>  i say on the wholefor personally i went through a most horrible nightmare of being buriedalive induced no doubt by the sepulchral nature of my surroundings</s> at dawn we were aroused by a loud trumpeting sound produced as weafterwards discovered by a young amahagger blowing through a holebored in its side into a hollowed elephant tusk which was kept for thepurpose</s> taking the hint we got up and went down to the stream to wash afterwhich the morning meal was served</s>  at breakfast one of the women nolonger quite young advanced and publicly kissed job</s>  i think it was inits way the most delightful thing putting its impropriety aside fora moment that i ever saw</s>  never shall i forget the respectable jobsabject terror and disgust</s>  job like myself is a bit of a misogynistifancy chiefly owing to the fact of his having been one of a familyof seventeenand the feelings expressed upon his countenance whenhe realised that he was not only being embraced publicly and withoutauthorisation on his own part but also in the presence of his masterswere too mixed and painful to admit of accurate description</s>  he sprangto his feet and pushed the woman a buxom person of about thirty fromhim</s> well i never</s>  he gasped whereupon probably thinking that he was onlycoy she embraced him again</s> be off with you</s>  get away you minx</s>  he shouted waving the woodenspoon with which he was eating his breakfast up and down before theladys face</s>  beg your pardon gentlemen i am sure i havent encouragedher</s>  oh lord</s>  shes coming for me again</s>  hold her mr</s>  holly</s>  pleasehold her</s>  i cant stand it i cant indeed</s>  this has never happened tome before gentlemen never</s>  theres nothing against my character andhere he broke off and ran as hard as he could go down the cave and foronce i saw the amahagger laugh</s>  as for the woman however she didnot laugh</s>  on the contrary she seemed to bristle with fury which themockery of the other women about only served to intensify</s>  she stoodthere literally snarling and shaking with indignation and seeing heri wished jobs scruples had been at jericho forming a shrewd guess thathis admirable behaviour had endangered our throats</s>  nor as the sequelshows was i wrong</s> the lady having retreated job returned in a great state of nervousnessand keeping his weather eye fixed upon every woman who came near him</s>  itook an opportunity to explain to our hosts that job was a married manand had had very unhappy experiences in his domestic relations whichaccounted for his presence here and his terror at the sight of womenbut my remarks were received in grim silence it being evident that ourretainers behaviour was considered as a slight to the householdat large although the women after the manner of some of their mostcivilised sisters made merry at the rebuff of their companion</s> after breakfast we took a walk and inspected the amahagger herds andalso their cultivated lands</s>  they have two breeds of cattle one largeand angular with no horns but yielding beautiful milk and the othera red breed very small and fat excellent for meat but of no value formilking purposes</s>  this last breed closely resembles the norfolk redpolestrain only it has horns which generally curve forward over the headsometimes to such an extent that they have to be cut to prevent themfrom growing into the bones of the skull</s>  the goats are longhaired andare used for eating only at least i never saw them milked</s>  as for theamahagger cultivation it is primitive in the extreme being all doneby means of a spade made of iron for these people smelt and work iron</s> this spade is shaped more like a big spearhead than anything else andhas no shoulder to it on which the foot can be set</s>  as a consequencethe labour of digging is very great</s>  it is however all done by themen the women contrary to the habits of most savage races beingentirely exempt from manual toil</s>  but then as i think i have saidelsewhere among the amahagger the weaker sex has established itsrights</s> at first we were much puzzled as to the origin and constitution ofthis extraordinary race points upon which they were singularlyuncommunicative</s>  as the time went onfor the next four days passedwithout any striking eventwe learnt something from leos lady friendustane who by the way stuck to that young gentleman like his ownshadow</s>  as to origin they had none at least so far as she wasaware</s>  there were however she informed us mounds of masonry and manypillars near the place where she lived which was called kr andwhich the wise said had once been houses wherein men lived and it wassuggested that they were descended from these men</s>  no one howeverdared go near these great ruins because they were haunted they onlylooked on them from a distance</s>  other similar ruins were to be seen shehad heard in various parts of the country that is wherever one ofthe mountains rose above the level of the swamp</s>  also the caves in whichthey lived had been hollowed out of the rocks by men perhaps the samewho built the cities</s>  they themselves had no written laws only customwhich was however quite as binding as law</s>  if any man offendedagainst the custom he was put to death by order of the father of thehousehold</s>  i asked how he was put to death and she only smiled andsaid that i might see one day soon</s> they had a queen however</s>  she was their queen but she was veryrarely seen perhaps once in two or three years when she came forth topass sentence on some offenders and when seen was muffled up in a bigcloak so that nobody could look upon her face</s>  those who waited uponher were deaf and dumb and therefore could tell no tales but it wasreported that she was lovely as no other woman was lovely or ever hadbeen</s>  it was rumoured also that she was immortal and had power overall things but she ustane could say nothing of all that</s>  what shebelieved was that the queen chose a husband from time to time and assoon as a female child was born this husband who was never again seenwas put to death</s>  then the female child grew up and took the place ofthe queen when its mother died and had been buried in the great caves</s> but of these matters none could speak with certainty</s>  only she wasobeyed throughout the length and breadth of the land and to questionher command was instant death</s>  she kept a guard but had no regulararmy and to disobey her was to die</s> i asked what size the land was and how many people lived in it</s>  sheanswered that there were ten households like this that she knewof including the big household where the queen was that all thehouseholds lived in caves in places resembling this stretch of raisedcountry dotted about in a vast extent of swamp which was only to bethreaded by secret paths</s>  often the households made war on each otheruntil she sent word that it was to stop and then they instantlyceased</s>  that and the fever which they caught in crossing the swampsprevented their numbers from increasing too much</s>  they had no connectionwith any other race indeed none lived near them or were able to threadthe vast swamps</s>  once an army from the direction of the great riverpresumably the zambesi had attempted to attack them but they got lostin the marshes and at night seeing the great balls of fire that moveabout there tried to come to them thinking that they marked the enemycamp and half of them were drowned</s>  as for the rest they soon died offever and starvation not a blow being struck at them</s>  the marshes shetold us were absolutely impassable except to those who knew the pathsadding what i could well believe that we should never have reachedthis place where we then were had we not been brought thither</s> these and many other things we learnt from ustane during the four dayspause before our real adventures began and as may be imagined theygave us considerable cause for thought</s>  the whole thing was exceedinglyremarkable almost incredibly so indeed and the oddest part of it wasthat so far it did more or less correspond to the ancient writing on thesherd</s>  and now it appeared that there was a mysterious queen clothed byrumour with dread and wonderful attributes and commonly known by theimpersonal but to my mind rather awesome title of she</s>  altogetheri could not make it out nor could leo though of course he wasexceedingly triumphant over me because i had persistently mocked at thewhole thing</s>  as for job he had long since abandoned any attempt to callhis reason his own and left it to drift upon the sea of circumstance</s> mahomed the arab who was by the way treated civilly indeed butwith chilling contempt by the amahagger was i discovered in a greatfright though i could not quite make out what he was frightened about</s> he would sit crouched up in a corner of the cave all day long callingupon allah and the prophet to protect him</s>  when i pressed him about ithe said that he was afraid because these people were not men or women atall but devils and that this was an enchanted land and upon my wordonce or twice since then i have been inclined to agree with him</s>  andso the time went on till the night of the fourth day after billali hadleft when something happened</s> we three and ustane were sitting round a fire in the cave just beforebedtime when suddenly the woman who had been brooding in silencerose and laid her hand upon leos golden curls and addressed him</s>  evennow when i shut my eyes i can see her proud imperial form clothedalternately in dense shadow and the red flickering of the fire as shestood the wild centre of as weird a scene as i ever witnessed anddelivered herself of the burden of her thoughts and forebodings in akind of rhythmical speech that ran something as follows  thou art my choseni have waited for thee from the beginning</s>   thou art very beautiful</s>  who hath hair like unto thee or skin so  white</s>   who hath so strong an arm who is so much a man</s>   thine eyes are the sky and the light in them is the stars</s>   thou art perfect and of a happy face and my heart turned itself  towards thee</s>   ay when mine eyes fell upon thee i did desire thee  then did i take thee to meoh thou beloved  and hold thee fast lest harm should come unto thee</s>   ay i did cover thine head with mine hair lest the sun should  strike it  and altogether was i thine and thou wast altogether mine</s>   and so it went for a little space till time was in labour with  an evil day  and then what befell on that day</s>  alas</s>  my beloved i know not</s>   but i i saw thee no morei i was lost in the blackness</s>   and she who is stronger did take thee ay she who is fairer than  ustane</s>   yet didst thou turn and call upon me and let thine eyes wander in  the darkness</s>   but nevertheless she prevailed by beauty and led thee down  horrible places  and then ah</s>  then my belovedhere this extraordinary woman broke off her speech or chant which wasso much musical gibberish to us for all that we understood of what shewas talking about and seemed to fix her flashing eyes upon the deepshadow before her</s>  then in a moment they acquired a vacant terrifiedstare as though they were striving to realise some halfseen horror</s> she lifted her hand from leos head and pointed into the darkness</s>  weall looked and could see nothing but she saw something or thought shedid and something evidently that affected even her iron nerves forwithout another sound down she fell senseless between us</s> leo who was growing really attached to this remarkable young personwas in a great state of alarm and distress and i to be perfectlycandid was in a condition not far removed from superstitious fear</s>  thewhole scene was an uncanny one</s> presently however she recovered and sat up with an extraordinaryconvulsive shudder</s> what didst thou mean ustane</s>  asked leo who thanks to years oftuition spoke arabic very prettily</s> nay my chosen she answered with a little forced laugh</s>  i did butsing unto thee after the fashion of my people</s>  surely i meant nothing</s> how could i speak of that which is not yet</s> and what didst thou see ustane</s>  i asked looking her sharply in theface</s> nay she answered again i saw naught</s>  ask me not what i saw</s>  whyshould i fright ye</s>  and then turning to leo with a look of the mostutter tenderness that i ever saw upon the face of a woman civilisedor savage she took his head between her hands and kissed him on theforehead as a mother might</s> when i am gone from thee my chosen she said when at night thoustretchest out thine hand and canst not find me then shouldst thouthink at times of me for of a truth i love thee well though i be notfit to wash thy feet</s>  and now let us love and take that which is givenus and be happy for in the grave there is no love and no warmth norany touching of the lips</s>  nothing perchance or perchance but bittermemories of what might have been</s>  tonight the hours are our own howknow we to whom they shall belong tomorrow</s> viiithe feast and after</s> on the day following this remarkable scenea scene calculated to makea deep impression upon anybody who beheld it more because of what itsuggested and seemed to foreshadow than of what it revealedit wasannounced to us that a feast would be held that evening in our honour</s> i did my best to get out of it saying that we were modest people andcared little for feasts but my remarks being received with the silenceof displeasure i thought it wisest to hold my tongue</s> accordingly just before sundown i was informed that everything wasready and accompanied by job went into the cave where i met leowho was as usual followed by ustane</s>  these two had been out walkingsomewhere and knew nothing of the projected festivity till that moment</s> when ustane heard of it i saw an expression of horror spring up upon herhandsome features</s>  turning she caught a man who was passing up the caveby the arm and asked him something in an imperious tone</s>  his answerseemed to reassure her a little for she looked relieved though farfrom satisfied</s>  next she appeared to attempt some remonstrance with theman who was a person in authority but he spoke angrily to her andshook her off and then changing his mind led her by the arm and sather down between himself and another man in the circle round the fireand i perceived that for some reason of her own she thought it best tosubmit</s> the fire in the cave was an unusually big one that night and in alarge circle round it were gathered about thirtyfive men and two womenustane and the woman to avoid whom job had played the rle of anotherscriptural character</s>  the men were sitting in perfect silence as wastheir custom each with his great spear stuck upright behind him ina socket cut in the rock for that purpose</s>  only one or two wore theyellowish linen garment of which i have spoken the rest had nothing onexcept the leopards skin about the middle</s> whats up now sir said job doubtfully</s>  bless us and save ustheres that woman again</s>  now surely she cant be after me seeingthat i have given her no encouragement</s>  they give me the creeps thewhole lot of them and thats a fact</s>  why look they have asked mahomedto dine too</s>  there that lady of mine is talking to him in as nice andcivil a way as possible</s>  well im glad it isnt me thats all</s> we looked up and sure enough the woman in question had risen and wasescorting the wretched mahomed from his corner where overcome by someacute prescience of horror he had been seated shivering and callingon allah</s>  he appeared unwilling enough to come if for no other reasonperhaps because it was an unaccustomed honour for hitherto his food hadbeen given to him apart</s>  anyway i could see that he was in a state ofgreat terror for his tottering legs would scarcely support hisstout bulky form and i think it was rather owing to the resourcesof barbarism behind him in the shape of a huge amahagger with aproportionately huge spear than to the seductions of the lady who ledhim by the hand that he consented to come at all</s> well i said to the others i dont at all like the look of thingsbut i suppose we must face it out</s>  have you fellows got your revolverson</s>  because if so you had better see that they are loaded</s> i have sir said job tapping his colt but mr</s>  leo has only got hishunting knife though that is big enough surely</s> feeling that it would not do to wait while the missing weapon wasfetched we advanced boldly and seated ourselves in a line with ourbacks against the side of the cave</s> as soon as we were seated an earthenware jar was passed roundcontaining a fermented fluid of by no means unpleasant taste thoughapt to turn upon the stomach made from crushed grainnot indian cornbut a small brown grain that grows upon its stem in clusters not unlikethat which in the southern part of africa is known by the name of kafircorn</s>  the vase which contained this liquor was very curious and asit more or less resembled many hundreds of others in use among theamahagger i may as well describe it</s>  these vases are of a very ancientmanufacture and of all sizes</s>  none such can have been made in thecountry for hundreds or rather thousands of years</s>  they are foundin the rock tombs of which i shall give a description in their properplace and my own belief is that after the fashion of the egyptianswith whom the former inhabitants of this country may have had someconnection they were used to receive the viscera of the dead</s>  leohowever is of opinion that as in the case of etruscan amphor theywere placed there for the spiritual use of the deceased</s>  they are mostlytwohandled and of all sizes some being nearly three feet in heightand running from that down to as many inches</s>  in shape they vary butall are exceedingly beautiful and graceful being made of a very fineblack ware not lustrous but slightly rough</s>  on this groundwork areinlaid figures much more graceful and lifelike than any others thati have seen on antique vases</s>  some of these inlaid pictures representlovescenes with a childlike simplicity and freedom of manner whichwould not commend itself to the taste of the present day</s>  others againgive pictures of maidens dancing and yet others of huntingscenes</s>  forinstance the very vase from which we were then drinking had on one sidea most spirited drawing of men apparently white in colour attacking abullelephant with spears while on the reverse was a picture not quiteso well done of a hunter shooting an arrow at a running antelope ishould say from the look of it either an eland or a koodoo</s> this is a digression at a critical moment but it is not too long forthe occasion for the occasion itself was very long</s>  with the exceptionof the periodical passing of the vase and the movement necessary tothrow fuel on to the fire nothing happened for the best part of a wholehour</s>  nobody spoke a word</s>  there we all sat in perfect silence staringat the glare and glow of the large fire and at the shadows thrown bythe flickering earthenware lamps which by the way were not ancient</s> on the open space between us and the fire lay a large wooden traywith four short handles to it exactly like a butchers tray only nothollowed out</s>  by the side of the tray was a great pair of longhandlediron pincers and on the other side of the fire was a similar pair</s> somehow i did not at all like the appearance of this tray and theaccompanying pincers</s>  there i sat and stared at them and at the silentcircle of the fierce moody faces of the men and reflected that itwas all very awful and that we were absolutely in the power of thisalarming people who to me at any rate were all the more formidablebecause their true character was still very much of a mystery to us</s> they might be better than i thought them or they might be worse</s>  ifeared that they were worse and i was not wrong</s>  it was a curious sortof a feast i reflected in appearance indeed an entertainment of thebarmecide stamp for there was absolutely nothing to eat</s> at last just as i was beginning to feel as though i were beingmesmerised a move was made</s>  without the slightest warning a man fromthe other side of the circle called out in a loud voicewhere is the flesh that we shall eat</s> thereon everybody in the circle answered in a deep measured tone andstretching out the right arm towards the fire as he spokethe flesh will come</s> is it a goat</s>  said the same man</s> it is a goat without horns and more than a goat and we shall slayit they answered with one voice and turning half round they one andall grasped the handles of their spears with the right hand and thensimultaneously let them go</s> is it an ox</s>  said the man again</s> it is an ox without horns and more than an ox and we shall slayit was the answer and again the spears were grasped and again letgo</s> then came a pause and i noticed with horror and a rising of the hairthat the woman next to mahomed began to fondle him patting his cheeksand calling him by names of endearment while her fierce eyes played upand down his trembling form</s>  i do not know why the sight frightened meso but it did frighten us all dreadfully especially leo</s>  the caressingwas so snakelike and so evidently a part of some ghastly formula thathad to be gone through</s>  i saw mahomed turn white under his brownskin sickly white with fear</s>    we afterwards learnt that its object was to pretend to  the victim that he was the object of love and admiration  and so to sooth his injured feelings and cause him to  expire in a happy and contented frame of mind</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> is the meat ready to be cooked</s>  asked the voice more rapidly</s> it is ready it is ready</s> is the pot hot to cook it</s>  it continued in a sort of scream thatechoed painfully down the great recesses of the cave</s> it is hot it is hot</s> great heavens</s>  roared leo remember the writing the people whoplace pots upon the heads of strangers</s> as he said the words before we could stir or even take the matter intwo great ruffians jumped up and seizing the long pincers thrust theminto the heart of the fire and the woman who had been caressing mahomedsuddenly produced a fibre noose from under her girdle or moocha andslipping it over his shoulders ran it tight while the men next to himseized him by the legs</s>  the two men with the pincers gave a heave andscattering the fire this way and that upon the rocky floor liftedfrom it a large earthenware pot heated to a white heat</s>  in an instantalmost with a single movement they had reached the spot where mahomedwas struggling</s>  he fought like a fiend shrieking in the abandonment ofhis despair and notwithstanding the noose round him and the effortsof the men who held his legs the advancing wretches were for the momentunable to accomplish their purpose which horrible and incredible as itseems was to put the redhot pot upon his head</s> i sprang to my feet with a yell of horror and drawing my revolver firedit by a sort of instinct straight at the diabolical woman who had beencaressing mahomed and was now gripping him in her arms</s>  the bulletstruck her in the back and killed her and to this day i am glad thatit did for as it afterwards transpired she had availed herself of theanthropophagous customs of the amahagger to organise the whole thing inrevenge of the slight put upon her by job</s>  she sank down dead and asshe did so to my terror and dismay mahomed by a superhuman effortburst from his tormenters and springing high into the air fell dyingupon her corpse</s>  the heavy bullet from my pistol had driven throughthe bodies of both at once striking down the murderess and saving hervictim from a death a hundred times more horrible</s>  it was an awful andyet a most merciful accident</s> for a moment there was a silence of astonishment</s>  the amahagger hadnever heard the report of a firearm before and its effects dismayedthem</s>  but the next a man close to us recovered himself and seized hisspear preparatory to making a lunge with it at leo who was the nearestto him</s> run for it</s>  i shouted setting the example by starting up the cave ashard as my legs would carry me</s>  i would have made for the open air ifit had been possible but there were men in the way and besides ihad caught sight of the forms of a crowd of people standing out clearagainst the skyline beyond the entrance to the cave</s>  up the cave i wentand after me came the others and after them thundered the whole crowdof cannibals mad with fury at the death of the woman</s>  with a bound icleared the prostrate form of mahomed</s>  as i flew over him i felt theheat from the redhot pot which was lying close by strike upon mylegs and by its glow saw his handsfor he was not quite deadstillfeebly moving</s>  at the top of the cave was a little platform of rockthree feet or so high by about eight deep on which two large lamps wereplaced at night</s>  whether this platform had been left as a seat or as araised point afterwards to be cut away when it had served its purposeas a standing place from which to carry on the excavations i do notknowat least i did not then</s>  at any rate we all three reached itand jumping on it prepared to sell our lives as dearly as we could</s> for a few seconds the crowd that was pressing on our heels hung backwhen they saw us face round upon them</s>  job was on one side of the rockto the left leo in the centre and i to the right</s>  behind us werethe lamps</s>  leo bent forward and looked down the long lane of shadowsterminating in the fire and lighted lamps through which the quietforms of our wouldbe murderers flitted to and fro with the faint lightglinting on their spears for even their fury was silent as a bulldogs</s> the only other thing visible was the redhot pot still glowing angrilyin the gloom</s>  there was a curious light in leos eyes and hishandsome face was set like a stone</s>  in his right hand was his heavyhuntingknife</s>  he shifted its thong a little up his wrist and then puthis arm round me and gave me a good hug</s> goodbye old fellow he said my dear friendmy more than father</s> we have no chance against those scoundrels they will finish us in afew minutes and eat us afterwards i suppose</s>  goodbye</s>  i led you intothis</s>  i hope you will forgive me</s>  goodbye job</s> gods will be done i said setting my teeth as i prepared for theend</s>  at that moment with an exclamation job lifted his revolver andfired and hit a mannot the man he had aimed at by the way anythingthat job shot at was perfectly safe</s> on they came with a rush and i fired too as fast as i could andchecked thembetween us job and i besides the woman killed ormortally wounded five men with our pistols before they were emptied</s> but we had no time to reload and they still came on in a way that wasalmost splendid in its recklessness seeing that they did not know butthat we could go on firing for ever</s> a great fellow bounded up upon the platform and leo struck him deadwith one blow of his powerful arm sending the knife right through him</s> i did the same by another but job missed his stroke and i saw a brawnyamahagger grip him by the middle and whirl him off the rock</s>  the knifenot being secured by a thong fell from jobs hand as he did so and bya most happy accident for him lit upon its handle on the rock just asthe body of the amahagger who was undermost struck upon its point andwas transfixed upon it</s>  what happened to job after that i am sure i donot know but my own impression is that he lay still upon the corpse ofhis deceased assailant playing possum as the americans say</s>  as formyself i was soon involved in a desperate encounter with two ruffianswho luckily for me had left their spears behind them and for thefirst time in my life the great physical power with which nature hasendowed me stood me in good stead</s>  i had hacked at the head of one manwith my huntingknife which was almost as big and heavy as a shortsword with such vigour that the sharp steel had split his skulldown to the eyes and was held so fast by it that as he suddenly fellsideways the knife was twisted right out of my hand</s> then it was that the two others sprang upon me</s>  i saw them coming andgot an arm round the waist of each and down we all fell upon the floorof the cave together rolling over and over</s>  they were strong men buti was mad with rage and that awful lust for slaughter which will creepinto the hearts of the most civilised of us when blows are flying andlife and death tremble on the turn</s>  my arms were round the two swarthydemons and i hugged them till i heard their ribs crack and crunch upbeneath my grip</s>  they twisted and writhed like snakes and clawed andbattered at me with their fists but i held on</s>  lying on my back thereso that their bodies might protect me from spear thrusts from above islowly crushed the life out of them and as i did so strange as it mayseem i thought of what the amiable head of my college at cambridge whois a member of the peace society and my brother fellows would say if byclairvoyance they could see me of all men playing such a bloody game</s> soon my assailants grew faint and almost ceased to struggle theirbreath had failed them and they were dying but still i dared not leavethem for they died very slowly</s>  i knew that if i relaxed my grip theywould revive</s>  the other ruffians probably thoughtfor we were all threelying in the shadow of the ledgethat we were all dead together at anyrate they did not interfere with our little tragedy</s> i turned my head and as i lay gasping in the throes of that awfulstruggle i could see that leo was off the rock now for the lamplightfell full upon him</s>  he was still on his feet but in the centre of asurging mass of struggling men who were striving to pull him down aswolves pull down a stag</s>  up above them towered his beautiful pale facecrowned with its bright curls for leo is six feet two high and i sawthat he was fighting with a desperate abandonment and energy that wasat once splendid and hideous to behold</s>  he drove his knife through onemanthey were so close to and mixed up with him that they could notget at him to kill him with their big spears and they had no knives orsticks</s>  the man fell and then somehow the knife was wrenched from hishand leaving him defenceless and i thought the end had come</s>  but nowith a desperate effort he broke loose from them seized the body of theman he had just slain and lifting it high in the air hurled it right atthe mob of his assailants so that the shock and weight of it sweptsome five or six of them to the earth</s>  but in a minute they were all upagain except one whose skull was smashed and had once more fastenedupon him</s>  and then slowly and with infinite labour and strugglingthe wolves bore the lion down</s>  once even then he recovered himself andfelled an amahagger with his fist but it was more than man could do tohold his own for long against so many and at last he came crashing downupon the rock floor falling as an oak falls and bearing with him tothe earth all those who clung about him</s>  they gripped him by his armsand legs and then cleared off his body</s> a spear cried a voicea spear to cut his throat and a vessel tocatch his blood</s> i shut my eyes for i saw the man coming with a spear and myself icould not stir to leos help for i was growing weak and the two men onme were not yet dead and a deadly sickness overcame me</s> then suddenly there was a disturbance and involuntarily i opened myeyes again and looked towards the scene of murder</s>  the girl ustane hadthrown herself on leos prostrate form covering his body with her bodyand fastening her arms about his neck</s>  they tried to drag her fromhim but she twisted her legs round his and hung on like a bulldog orrather like a creeper to a tree and they could not</s>  then they tried tostab him in the side without hurting her but somehow she shielded himand he was only wounded</s> at last they lost patience</s> drive the spear through the man and the woman together said a voicethe same voice that had asked the questions at that ghastly feast soof a verity shall they be wed</s> then i saw the man with the weapon straighten himself for the effort</s>  isaw the cold steel gleam on high and once more i shut my eyes</s> as i did so i heard the voice of a man thunder out in tones that rangand echoed down the rocky wayscease</s> then i fainted and as i did so it flashed through my darkening mindthat i was passing down into the last oblivion of death</s> ixa little footwhen i opened my eyes again i found myself lying on a skin mat not farfrom the fire round which we had been gathered for that dreadful feast</s> near me lay leo still apparently in a swoon and over him was bendingthe tall form of the girl ustane who was washing a deep spear woundin his side with cold water preparatory to binding it up with linen</s> leaning against the wall of the cave behind her was job apparentlyuninjured but bruised and trembling</s>  on the other side of the firetossed about this way and that as though they had thrown themselvesdown to sleep in some moment of absolute exhaustion were the bodies ofthose whom we had killed in our frightful struggle for life</s>  i countedthem there were twelve besides the woman and the corpse of poormahomed who had died by my hand which the firestained pot at itsside was placed at the end of the irregular line</s>  to the left a body ofmen were engaged in binding the arms of the survivors of the cannibalsbehind them and then fastening them two and two</s>  the villains weresubmitting with a look of sulky indifference upon their faces whichaccorded ill with the baffled fury that gleamed in their sombre eyes</s> in front of these men directing the operations stood no other than ourfriend billali looking rather tired but particularly patriarchalwith his flowing beard and as cool and unconcerned as though he weresuperintending the cutting up of an ox</s> presently he turned and perceiving that i was sitting up advancedto me and with the utmost courtesy said that he trusted that i feltbetter</s>  i answered that at present i scarcely knew how i felt exceptthat i ached all over</s> then he bent down and examined leos wound</s> it is an evil cut he said but the spear has not pierced theentrails</s>  he will recover</s> thanks to thy arrival my father i answered</s>  in another minute weshould all have been beyond the reach of recovery for those devils ofthine would have slain us as they would have slain our servant

would have died amerciful death to the death these hynamen shall die</s>  tell me i prayof thee how it came about</s> in a few words i sketched what had happened</s> ah so he answered</s>  thou seest my son here there is a custom thatif a stranger comes into this country he may be slain by the pot andeaten</s> it is hospitality turned upside down i answered feebly</s>  in ourcountry we entertain a stranger and give him food to eat</s>  here ye eathim and are entertained</s> it is a custom he answered with a shrug</s>  myself i think it an evilone but then he added by an afterthought i do not like the tasteof strangers especially after they have wandered through the swamps andlived on wildfowl</s>  when shewhomustbeobeyed sent orders that yewere to be saved alive she said naught of the black man thereforebeing hynas these men lusted after his flesh and the woman it waswhom thou didst rightly slay who put it into their evil hearts tohotpot him</s>  well they will have their reward</s>  better for them would itbe if they had never seen the light than that they should stand beforeshe in her terrible anger</s>  happy are those of them who died by yourhands</s> ah he went on it was a gallant fight that ye fought</s>  knowest thouthat longarmed old baboon that thou art thou hast crushed in the ribsof those two who are laid out there as though they were but as the shellon an egg</s>  and the young one the lion it was a beautiful stand thathe madeone against so manythree did he slay outright and that onethereand he pointed to a body that was still moving a littlewilldie anon for his head is cracked across and others of those who arebound are hurt</s>  it was a gallant fight and thou and he have made afriend of me by it for i love to see a wellfought fray</s>  but tell memy son the baboonand now i think of it thy face too is hairy andaltogether like a baboonshow was it that ye slew those with a hole inthem</s> ye made a noise they say and slew themthey fell down on thefaces at the noise</s> i explained to him as well as i could but very shortlyfor i wasterribly wearied and only persuaded to talk at all through fearof offending one so powerful if i refused to do sowhat were theproperties of gunpowder and he instantly suggested that i shouldillustrate what i said by operating on the person of one of theprisoners</s>  one he said never would be counted and it would not onlybe very interesting to him but would give me the opportunity of aninstalment of revenge</s>  he was greatly astounded when i told him that itwas not our custom to avenge ourselves in cold blood and that we leftvengeance to the law and a higher power of which he knew nothing</s>  iadded however that when i recovered i would take him out shootingwith us and he should kill an animal for himself and at this he was aspleased as a child at the promise of a new toy</s> just then leo opened his eyes beneath the stimulus of some brandy ofwhich we still had a little that job had poured down his throat andour conversation came to an end</s> after this we managed to get leo who was in a very poor way indeed andonly half conscious safely off to bed supported by job and that bravegirl ustane to whom had i not been afraid that she might resent it iwould certainly have given a kiss for her splendid behaviour in savingmy boys life at the risk of her own</s>  but ustane was not the sort ofyoung person with whom one would care to take liberties unless one wereperfectly certain that they would not be misunderstood so i repressedmy inclinations</s>  then bruised and battered but with a sense of safetyin my breast to which i had for some days been a stranger i crept offto my own little sepulchre not forgetting before i laid down in it tothank providence from the bottom of my heart that it was not a sepulchreindeed as save for a merciful combination of events that i can onlyattribute to its protection it would certainly have been for me thatnight</s>  few men have been nearer their end and yet escaped it than wewere on that dreadful day</s> i am a bad sleeper at the best of times and my dreams that night whenat last i got to rest were not of the pleasantest</s>  the awful vision ofpoor mahomed struggling to escape the redhot pot would haunt them andthen in the background as it were a veiled form was always hoveringwhich from time to time seemed to draw the coverings from its bodyrevealing now the perfect shape of a lovely blooming woman and nowagain the white bones of a grinning skeleton and which as it veiledand unveiled uttered the mysterious and apparently meaninglesssentencethat which is alive and hath known death and that which is dead yetcan never die for in the circle of the spirit life is naught and deathis naught</s>  yea all things live for ever though at times they sleep andare forgotten</s> the morning came at last but when it came i found that i was too stiffand sore to rise</s>  about seven job arrived limping terribly and withhis face the colour of a rotten apple and told me that leo had sleptfairly but was very weak</s>  two hours afterwards billali job calledhim billygoat to which indeed his white beard gave him someresemblance or more familiarly billy came too bearing a lamp inhis hand his towering form reaching nearly to the roof of the littlechamber</s>  i pretended to be asleep and through the cracks of my eyelidswatched his sardonic but handsome old face</s>  he fixed his hawklike eyesupon me and stroked his glorious white beard which by the waywould have been worthy a hundred a year to any london barber as anadvertisement</s> ah</s>  i heard him mutter billali had a habit of muttering to himselfhe is uglyugly as the other is beautifula very baboon it was agood name</s>  but i like the man</s>  strange now at my age that i shouldlike a man</s>  what says the proverbmistrust all men and slay him whomthou mistrustest overmuch and as for women flee from them for theyare evil and in

theytaught him his tricks and i trust that she will not bewitch him</s>  poorbaboon</s>  he must be wearied after that fight</s>  i will go lest i shouldawake him</s> i waited till he had turned and was nearly through the entrance walkingsoftly on tiptoe and then i called after him</s> my father i said is it thou</s> yes my son it is i but let me not disturb thee</s>  i did but come tosee how thou didst fare and to tell thee that those who would haveslain thee my baboon are by now far on their road to she</s>  she saidthat ye also were to come at once but i fear ye cannot yet</s> nay i said not till we have recovered a little but have me borneout into the daylight i pray thee my father</s>  i love not this place</s> ah no he answered it hath a sad air</s>  i remember when i was a boy ifound the body of a fair woman lying where thou liest now yes on thatvery bench</s>  she was so beautiful that i was wont to creep in hither witha lamp and gaze upon her</s>  had it not been for her cold hands almostcould i think that she slept and would one day awake so fair andpeaceful was she in her robes of white</s>  white was she too and herhair was yellow and lay down her almost to the feet</s>  there are many suchstill in the tombs at the place where she is for those who set themthere had a way i know naught of whereby to keep their beloved out ofthe crumbling hand of decay even when death had slain them</s>  ay dayby day i came hither and gazed on her till at lastlaugh not at mestranger for i was but a silly ladi learned to love that dead formthat shell which once had held a life that no more is</s>  i would creepup to her and kiss her cold face and wonder how many men had lived anddied since she was and who had loved her and embraced her in the daysthat long had passed away</s>  and my baboon i think i learned wisdom fromthat dead one for of a truth it taught me of the littleness of lifeand the length of death and how all things that are under the sun godown one path and are for ever forgotten</s>  and so i mused and it seemedto me that wisdom flowed into me from the dead till one day my mothera watchful woman but hastyminded seeing i was changed followed meand saw the beautiful white one and feared that i was bewitched asindeed i was</s>  so half in dread and half in anger she took up thelamp and standing the dead woman up against the wall even there setfire to her hair and she burnt fiercely even down to the feet forthose who are thus kept burn excellently well</s> see my son there on the roof is yet the smoke of her burning</s> i looked up doubtfully and there sure enough on the roof of thesepulchre was a peculiarly unctuous and sooty mark three feet or moreacross</s>  doubtless it had in the course of years been rubbed off thesides of the little cave but on the roof it remained and there was nomistaking its appearance</s> she burnt he went on in a meditative way even to the feet but thefeet i came back and saved cutting the burnt bone from them andhid them under the stone bench there wrapped up in a piece of linen</s> surely i remember it as though it were but yesterday</s>  perchance theyare there if none have found them even to this hour</s>  of a truth i havenot entered this chamber from that time to this very day</s>  stay i willlook and kneeling down he groped about with his long arm in therecess under the stone bench</s>  presently his face brightened and with anexclamation he pulled something forth which was caked in dust which heshook on to the floor</s>  it was covered with the remains of a rotting ragwhich he undid and revealed to my astonished gaze a beautifully shapedand almost white womans foot looking as fresh and firm as though ithad but now been placed there</s> thou seest my son the baboon he said in a sad voice i spake thetruth to thee for here is yet one foot remaining</s>  take it my son andgaze upon it</s> i took this cold fragment of mortality in my hand and looked at it inthe light of the lamp with feelings which i cannot describe so mixedup were they between astonishment fear and fascination</s>  it was lightmuch lighter i should say than it had been in the living state and theflesh to all appearance was still flesh though about it there clung afaintly aromatic odour</s>  for the rest it was not shrunk or shrivelled oreven black and unsightly like the flesh of egyptian mummies but plumpand fair and except where it had been slightly burnt perfect as onthe day of deatha very triumph of embalming</s> poor little foot</s>
 i set it down upon the stone bench where it had lainfor so many thousand years and wondered whose was the beauty thatit had upborne through the pomp and pageantry of a forgottencivilisationfirst as a merry childs then as a blushing maids andlastly as a perfect womans</s>  through what halls of life had its softstep echoed and in the end with what courage had it trodden down thedusty ways of death</s>  to whose side had it stolen in the hush of nightwhen the black slave slept upon the marble floor and who had listenedfor its stealing</s>  shapely little foot</s>  well might it have been set uponthe proud neck of a conqueror bent at last to womans beauty andwell might the lips of nobles and of kings have been pressed upon itsjewelled whiteness</s> i wrapped up this relic of the past in the remnants of the old linen ragwhich had evidently formed a portion of its owners graveclothes forit was partially burnt and put it away in my gladstone baga strangecombination i thought</s>  then with billalis help i staggered off to seeleo</s>  i found him dreadfully bruised worse even than myself perhapsowing to the excessive whiteness of his skin and faint and weak withthe loss of blood from the flesh wound in his side but for all thatcheerful as a cricket and asking for some breakfast</s>  job and ustanegot him on to the bottom or rather the sacking of a litter which wasremoved from its pole for that purpose and with the aid of old billalicarried him out into the shade at the mouth of the cave from which bythe way every trace of the slaughter of the previous night had now beenremoved and there we all breakfasted and indeed spent that day andmost of the two following ones</s> on the third morning job and myself were practically recovered</s>  leo alsowas so much better that i yielded to billalis often expressed entreatyand agreed to start at once upon our journey to kr which we were toldwas the name of the place where the mysterious she lived though istill feared for its effect upon leo and especially lest the motionshould cause his wound which was scarcely skinned over to break openagain</s>  indeed had it not been for billalis evident anxiety to get offwhich led us to suspect that some difficulty or danger might threaten usif we did not comply with it i would not have consented to go</s> xspeculationswithin an hour of our finally deciding to start five litters werebrought up to the door of the cave each accompanied by four regularbearers and two spare hands also a band of about fifty armed amahaggerwho were to form the escort and carry the baggage</s>  three of theselitters of course were for us and one for billali who i wasimmensely relieved to hear was to be our companion while the fifth ipresumed was for the use of ustane</s> does the lady go with us my father</s>  i asked of billali as he stoodsuperintending things in general</s> he shrugged his shoulders as he answeredif she wills</s>  in this country the women do what they please</s>  we worshipthem and give them their way because without them the world could notgo on they are the source of life</s> ah i said the matter never having struck me quite in that lightbefore</s> we worship them he went on up to a point till at last they getunbearable which he added they do about every second generation</s> and then what do you do</s>  i asked with curiosity</s> then he answered with a faint smile we rise and kill the oldones as an example to the young ones and to show them that we are thestrongest</s>  my poor wife was killed in that way three years ago</s>  it wasvery sad but to tell thee the truth my son life has been happiersince for my age protects me from the young ones</s> in short i replied quoting the saying of a great man whose wisdomhas not yet lightened the darkness of the amahagger thou hast foundthy position one of greater freedom and less responsibility</s> this phrase puzzled him a little at first from its vagueness though ithink my translation hit off its sense very well but at last he saw itand appreciated it</s> yes yes my baboon he said i see it now but all theresponsibilities are killed at least some of them are and that iswhy there are so few old women about just now</s>  well they brought it onthemselves</s>  as for this girl he went on in a graver tone i knownot what to say</s>  she is a brave girl and she loves the lion leo thousawest how she clung to him and saved his life</s>  also she is accordingto our custom wed to him and has a right to go where he goes unlesshe added significantly she would say her no for her word overridesall rights</s> and if she bade her leave him and the girl refused</s>  what then</s> if he said with a shrug the hurricane bids the tree to bend andit will not what happens</s> and then without waiting for an answer he turned and walked to hislitter and in ten minutes from that time we were all well under way</s> it took us an hour and more to cross the cup of the volcanic plainand another halfhour or so to climb the edge on the farther side</s>  oncethere however the view was a very fine one</s>  before us was a long steepslope of grassy plain broken here and there by clumps of trees mostlyof the thorn tribe</s>  at the bottom of this gentle slope some nine or tenmiles away we could make out a dim sea of marsh over which the foulvapours hung like smoke about a city</s>  it was easy going for the bearersdown the slopes and by midday we had reached the borders of the dismalswamp</s>  here we halted to eat our midday meal and then following awinding and devious path plunged into the morass</s>  presently the pathat any rate to our unaccustomed eyes grew so faint as to be almostindistinguishable from those made by the aquatic beasts and birds andit is to this day a mystery to me how our bearers found their way acrossthe marshes</s>  ahead of the cavalcade marched two men with long poleswhich they now and again plunged into the ground before them the reasonof this being that the nature of the soil frequently changed from causeswith which i am not acquainted so that places which might be safeenough to cross one month would certainly swallow the wayfarer the next</s> never did i see a more dreary and depressing scene</s>  miles on miles ofquagmire varied only by bright green strips of comparatively solidground and by deep and sullen pools fringed with tall rushes in whichthe bitterns boomed and the frogs croaked incessantly miles on miles ofit without a break unless the fever fog can be called a break</s>  the onlylife in this great morass was that of the aquatic birds and the animalsthat fed on them of both of which there were vast numbers</s>  geesecranes ducks teal coot snipe and plover swarmed all around us manybeing of varieties that were quite new to me and all so tame that onecould almost have knocked them over with a stick</s>  among these birds iespecially noticed a very beautiful variety of painted snipe almost thesize of a woodcock and with a flight more resembling that birds thanan english snipes</s>  in the pools too was a species of small alligatoror enormous iguana i do not know which that fed billali told me uponthe waterfowl also large quantities of a hideous black watersnake ofwhich the bite is very dangerous though not i gathered so deadly as acobras or a puff adders</s>  the bullfrogs were also very large andwith voices proportionate to their size and as for the mosquitoesthemusqueteers as job called themthey were if possible even worsethan they had been on the river and tormented us greatly</s>  undoubtedlyhowever the worst feature of the swamp was the awful smell ofrotting vegetation that hung about it which was at times positivelyoverpowering and the malarious exhalations that accompanied it whichwe were of course obliged to breathe</s> on we went through it all till at last the sun sank in sullen splendourjust as we reached a spot of rising ground about two acres in extentalittle oasis of dry in the midst of the miry wildernesswhere billaliannounced that we were to camp</s>  the camping however turned out to bea very simple process and consisted in fact in sitting down on theground round a scanty fire made of dry reeds and some wood that had beenbrought with us</s>  however we made the best we could of it and smokedand ate with such appetite as the smell of damp stifling heat wouldallow for it was very hot on this low land and yet oddly enoughchilly at times</s>  but however hot it was we were glad enough to keepnear the fire because we found that the mosquitoes did not like thesmoke</s>  presently we rolled ourselves up in our blankets and tried togo to sleep but so far as i was concerned the bullfrogs and theextraordinary roaring and alarming sound produced by hundreds of snipehovering high in the air made sleep an impossibility to say nothing ofour other discomforts</s>  i turned and looked at leo who was next me hewas dozing but his face had a flushed appearance that i did not likeand by the flickering firelight i saw ustane who was lying on theother side of him raise herself from time to time upon her elbow andlook at him anxiously enough</s> however i could do nothing for him for we had all already taken agood dose of quinine which was the only preventive we had so i lay andwatched the stars come out by thousands till all the immense arch ofheaven was strewn with glittering points and every point a world</s> here was a glorious sight by which man might well measure his owninsignificance</s>  soon i gave up thinking about it for the mind wearieseasily when it strives to grapple with the infinite and to trace thefootsteps of the almighty as he strides from sphere to sphere ordeduce his purpose from his works</s>  such things are not for us to know</s> knowledge is to the strong and we are weak</s>  too much wisdom wouldperchance blind our imperfect sight and too much strength would makeus drunk and overweight our feeble reason till it fell and we weredrowned in the depths of our own vanity</s>  for what is the first resultof mans increased knowledge interpreted from natures book by thepersistent effort of his purblind observation</s>  it is not but too oftento make him question the existence of his maker or indeed of anyintelligent purpose beyond his own</s>  the truth is veiled because wecould no more look upon her glory than we can upon the sun</s>  it woulddestroy us</s>  full knowledge is not for man as man is here for hiscapacities which he is apt to think so great are indeed but small</s>  thevessel is soon filled and were onethousandth part of the unutterableand silent wisdom that directs the rolling of those shining spheres andthe force which makes them roll pressed

tribulation to catch at the bubbles blown byfate which he calls pleasure thankful if before they burst they resta moment in his hand and when the tragedy is played out and his hourcomes to perish to pass humbly whither he knows not</s> above me as i lay shone the eternal stars and there at my feet theimpish marshborn balls of fire rolled this way and that vapourtossedand earthdesiring and methought that in the two i saw a type and imageof what man is and what perchance man may one day be if the livingforce who ordained him and them should so ordain this also</s>  oh that itmight be ours to rest year by year upon that high level of the heart towhich at times we momentarily attain</s>  oh that we could shake loose theprisoned pinions of the soul and soar to that superior point whencelike to some traveller looking out through space from dariens giddiestpeak we might gaze with spiritual eyes deep into infinity</s> what would it be to cast off this earthy robe to have done for everwith these earthy thoughts and miserable desires no longer like thosecorpse candles to be tossed this way and that by forces beyond ourcontrol or which if we can theoretically control them we are at timesdriven by the exigencies of our nature to obey</s>  yes to cast them offto have done with the foul and thorny places of the world and like tothose glittering points above me to rest on high wrapped for ever inthe brightness of our better selves that even now shines in us as firefaintly shines within those lurid balls and lay down our littleness inthat wide glory of our dreams that invisible but surrounding good fromwhich all truth and beauty comes</s> these and many such thoughts passed through my mind that night</s>  theycome to torment us all at times</s>  i say to torment

ithope</s>  without hope we should suffer moral death and by the help of hopewe yet may climb to heaven or at the worst if she also prove but akindly mockery given to hold us from despair be gently lowered into theabysses of eternal sleep</s> then i fell to reflecting upon the undertaking on which we were bentand what a wild one it was and yet how strangely the story seemed tofit in with what had been written centuries ago upon the sherd</s>  whowas this extraordinary woman queen over a people apparently asextraordinary as herself and reigning amidst the vestiges of a lostcivilisation</s>  and what was the meaning of this story of the fire thatgave unending life</s>  could it be possible that any fluid or essenceshould exist which might so fortify these fleshy walls that theyshould from age to age resist the mines and batterings of decay</s>  it waspossible though not probable</s>  the infinite continuation of life wouldnot as poor vincey said be so marvellous a thing as the production oflife and its temporary endurance</s>  and if it were true what then</s>  theperson who found it could no doubt rule the world</s>  he could accumulateall the wealth in the world and all the power and all the wisdom thatis power</s>  he might give a lifetime to the study of each art or science</s> well if that were so and this she were practically immortal whichi did not for one moment believe how was it that with all these thingsat her feet she preferred to remain in a cave amongst a societyof cannibals</s>  this surely settled the question</s>  the whole story wasmonstrous and only worthy of the superstitious days in which it waswritten</s>  at any rate i was very sure that i would not attempt toattain unending life</s>  i had had far too many worries and disappointmentsand secret bitternesses during my forty odd years of existence to wishthat this state of affairs should be continued indefinitely</s>  and yet isuppose that my life has been comparatively speaking a happy one</s> and then reflecting that at the present moment there was far morelikelihood of our earthly careers being cut exceedingly short than oftheir being unduly prolonged i at last managed to get to sleep a factfor which anybody who reads this narrative if anybody ever does mayvery probably be thankful</s> when i woke again it was just dawning and the guard and bearers weremoving about like ghosts through the dense morning mists getting readyfor our start</s>  the fire had died quite down and i rose and stretchedmyself shivering in every limb from the damp cold of the dawn</s>  then ilooked at leo</s>  he was sitting up holding his hands to his head and isaw that his face was flushed and his eye bright and yet yellow roundthe pupil</s> well leo i said how do you feel</s> i feel as though i were going to die he answered hoarsely</s>  my headis splitting my body is trembling and i am as sick as a cat</s> i whistled or if i did not whistle i felt inclined toleo had got asharp attack of fever</s>  i went to job and asked him for the quinineof which fortunately we had still a good supply only to find that jobhimself was not much better</s>  he complained of pains across the back anddizziness and was almost incapable of helping himself</s>  then i did theonly thing it was possible to do under the circumstancesgave them bothabout ten grains of quinine and took a slightly smaller dose myself asa matter of precaution</s>  after that i found billali and explained to himhow matters stood asking at the same time what he thought had best bedone</s>  he came with me and looked at leo and job whom by the wayhe had named the pig on account of his fatness round face and smalleyes</s> ah he said when we were out of earshot the fever</s>  i thought so</s> the lion has it badly but he is young and he may live</s>  as for the pighis attack is not so bad it is the little fever which he has thatalways begins with pains across the back it will spend itself upon hisfat</s> can they go on my father</s>  i asked</s> nay my son they must go on</s>  if they stop here they will certainlydie also they will be better in the litters than on the ground</s>  bytonight if all goes well we shall be across the marsh and in goodair</s>  come let us lift them into the litters and start for it is verybad to stand still in this morning fog</s>  we can eat our meal as we go</s> this we accordingly did and with a heavy heart i once more set out uponour strange journey</s>  for the first three hours all went as well ascould be expected and then an accident happened that nearly lost us thepleasure of the company of our venerable friend billali whose litterwas leading the cavalcade</s>  we were going through a particularlydangerous stretch of quagmire in which the bearers sometimes sank up totheir knees</s>  indeed it was a mystery to me how they contrived tocarry the heavy litters at all over such ground as that which we weretraversing though the two spare hands as well as the four regularones had of course to put their shoulders to the pole</s> presently as we blundered and floundered along there was a sharpcry then a storm of exclamations and last of all a most tremendoussplash and the whole caravan halted</s> i jumped out of my litter and ran forward</s>  about twenty yards ahead wasthe edge of one of those sullen peaty pools of which i have spoken thepath we were following running along the top of its bank that as ithappened was a steep one</s>  looking towards this pool to my horror i sawthat billalis litter was floating on it and as for billali himself hewas nowhere to be seen</s>  to make matters clear i may as well explainat once what had happened</s>  one of billalis bearers had unfortunatelytrodden on a basking snake which had bitten him in the leg whereon hehad not unnaturally let go of the pole and then finding that hewas tumbling down the bank grasped at the litter to save himself</s>  theresult of this was what might have been expected</s>  the litter was pulledover the edge of the bank the bearers let go and the whole thingincluding billali and the man who had been bitten rolled into the slimypool</s>  when i got to the edge of the water neither of them were to beseen indeed the unfortunate bearer never was seen again</s>  either hestruck his head against something or get wedged in the mud or possiblythe snakebite paralyzed him</s>  at any rate he vanished</s>  but thoughbillali was not to be seen his whereabouts was clear enough from theagitation of the floating litter in the bearing cloth and curtains ofwhich he was entangled</s> he is there</s>  our father is there</s>  said one of the men but he did notstir a finger to help him nor did any of the others</s>  they simply stoodand stared at the water</s> out of the way you brutes</s>  i shouted in english and throwing off myhat i took a run and sprang well out into the horrid slimylooking pool</s> a couple of strokes took me to where billali was struggling beneath thecloth</s> somehow i do not quite know how i managed to push it free of himand his venerable head all covered with green slime like that of ayellowish bacchus with ivy leaves emerged upon the surface of thewater</s>  the rest was easy for billali was an eminently practicalindividual and had the common sense not to grasp hold of me as drowningpeople often do so i got him by the arm and towed him to the bankthrough the mud out of which we were with difficulty dragged</s>  such a filthyspectacle as we presented i have never seen before or since and it willperhaps give some idea of the almost superhuman dignity of billalisappearance when i say that coughing halfdrowned and covered with mudand green slime as he was with his beautiful beard coming to a drippingpoint like a chinamans freshlyoiled pigtail he still lookedvenerable and imposing</s> ye dogs he said addressing the bearers as soon as he hadsufficiently recovered to speak ye left me your father to drown</s> had it not been for this stranger my son the baboon assuredly i shouldhave drowned</s>  well i will remember it and he fixed them with hisgleaming though slightly watery eye in a way i saw that they did notlike though they tried to appear sulkily indifferent</s> as for thee my son the old man went on turning towards me andgrasping my hand rest assured that i am thy friend through good andevil</s>  thou hast saved my life perchance a day may come when i shallsave thine</s> after that we cleaned ourselves as best we could fished out the litterand went on minus the man who had been drowned</s>  i do not know ifit was owing to his being an unpopular character or from nativeindifference and selfishness of temperament but i am bound to say thatnobody seemed to grieve much over his sudden and final disappearanceunless perhaps it was the men who had to do his share of the work</s> xithe plain of krabout an hour before sundown we at last to my unbounded gratitudeemerged from the great belt of marsh on to land that swelled upwards ina succession of rolling waves</s>  just on the hither side of the crestof the first wave we halted for the night</s>  my first act was to examineleos condition</s>  it was if anything worse than in the morning and anew and very distressing feature vomiting set in and continued tilldawn</s>  not one wink of sleep did i get that night for i passed it inassisting ustane who was one of the most gentle and indefatigablenurses i ever saw to wait upon leo and job</s>  however the air here waswarm and genial without being too hot and there were no mosquitoesto speak of</s>  also we were above the level of the marsh mist which laystretched beneath us like the dim smokepall over a city lit up hereand there by the wandering globes of fen fire</s>  thus it will be seen thatwe were speaking comparatively in clover</s> by dawn on the following morning leo was quite lightheaded and fanciedthat he was divided into halves</s>  i was dreadfully distressed and beganto wonder with a sort of sick fear what the end of the attack would be</s> alas</s>  i had heard but too much of how these attacks generally terminate</s> as i was wondering billali came up and said that we must be getting onmore especially as in his opinion if leo did not reach some spotwhere he could be quiet and have proper nursing within the next twelvehours his life would only be a matter of a day or two</s>  i could not butagree with him so we got leo into the litter and started on ustanewalking by his side to keep the flies off him and see that he did notthrow himself out on to the ground</s> within half an hour of sunrise we had reached the top of the rise ofwhich i have spoken and a most beautiful view broke upon our gaze</s> beneath us was a rich stretch of country verdant with grass and lovelywith foliage and flowers</s>  in the background at a distance so far as icould judge of some eighteen miles from where we then stood a huge andextraordinary mountain rose abruptly from the plain</s>  the base of thisgreat mountain appeared to consist of a grassy slope but rising fromthis i should say from subsequent observation at a height of aboutfive hundred feet above the level of the plain was a most tremendousand absolutely precipitous wall of bare rock quite twelve or fifteenhundred feet in height</s>  the shape of the mountain which was undoubtedlyof volcanic origin was round and of course as only a segment of itscircle was visible it was difficult to estimate its exact size whichwas enormous</s>  i afterwards discovered that it could cover less thanfifty square miles of ground</s>  anything more grand and imposing thanthe sight presented by this great natural castle starting in solitarygrandeur from the level of the plain i never saw and i suppose i nevershall</s>  its very solitude added to its majesty and its towering cliffsseemed to kiss the sky</s>  indeed generally speaking they were clothed inclouds that lay in fleecy masses upon their broad and level battlements</s> i sat up in my hammock and gazed out across the plain at this thrillingand majestic sight and i suppose that billali noticed it for hebrought his litter alongside</s> behold the house of shewhomustbeobeyed</s>  he said</s>  had ever aqueen such a throne before</s> it is wonderful my father i answered</s>  but how do we enter</s>  thosecliffs look hard to climb</s> thou shalt see my baboon</s>  look now at the path below us</s>  what thinkestthou that it is</s>  thou art a wise man</s>  come tell me</s> i looked and saw what appeared to be the line of roadway runningstraight towards the base of the mountain though it was covered withturf</s>  there were high banks on each side of it broken here and therebut fairly continuous on the whole the meaning of which i did notunderstand</s>  it seemed so very odd that anybody should embank a roadway</s> well my father i answered i suppose that it is a road otherwisei should have been inclined to say that it was the bed of a river orrather i added observing the extraordinary directness of the cuttingof a canal</s> billaliwho by the way was none the worse for his immersion of theday beforenodded his head sagely as he repliedthou art right my son</s>  it is a channel cut out by those who werebefore us in this place to carry away water</s>  of this i am sure withinthe rocky circle of the mountain whither we journey was once a greatlake</s>  but those who were before us by wonderful arts of which iknow naught hewed a path for the water through the solid rock of themountain piercing even to the bed of the lake</s>  but first they cut thechannel that thou seest across the plain</s>  then when at last the waterburst out it rushed down the channel that had been made to receive itand crossed this plain till it reached the low land behind the riseand there perchance it made the swamp through which we have come</s>  thenwhen the lake was drained dry the people whereof i speak built a mightycity on its bed whereof naught but ruins and the name of kr yetremaineth and from age to age hewed the caves and passages that thouwilt see</s> it may be i answered but if so how is it that the lake does notfill up again with the rains and the water of the springs</s> nay my son the people were a wise people and they left a drain tokeep it clear</s>  seest thou the river to the right</s>  and he pointed to afairsized stream that wound away across the plain some four miles fromus</s>  that is the drain and it comes out through the mountain wall wherethis cutting goes in</s>  at first perhaps the water ran down this canalbut afterwards the people turned it and used the cutting for a road</s> and is there then no other place where one may enter into the greatmountain i asked except through that drain</s> there is a place he answered where cattle and men on foot may crosswith much labour but it is secret</s>  a year mightest thou search andshouldst never find it</s>  it is only used once a year when the herds ofcattle that have been fatting on the slopes of the mountain and on thisplain are driven into the space within</s> and does she live there always</s>  i asked or does she come at timeswithout the mountain</s> nay my son where she is there she is</s> by now we were well on to the great plain and i was examining withdelight the varied beauty of its semitropical flowers and trees thelatter of which grew singly or at most in clumps of three or four muchof the timber being of large size and belonging apparently to a varietyof evergreen oak</s>  there were also many palms some of them more than onehundred feet high and the largest and most beautiful tree ferns thati ever saw about which hung clouds of jewelled honeysuckers andgreatwinged butterflies</s>  wandering about among the trees or crouchingin the long and feathered grass were all varieties of game fromrhinocerotes down</s>  i saw a rhinoceros buffalo a large herd elandquagga and sable antelope the most beautiful of all the bucks notto mention many smaller varieties of game and three ostriches whichscudded away at our approach like white drift before a gale</s>  soplentiful was the game that at last i could stand it no longer</s>  i hada single barrel sporting martini with me in the litter the expressbeing too cumbersome and espying a beautiful fat eland rubbing himselfunder one of the oaklike trees i jumped out of the litter andproceeded to creep as near to him as i could</s>  he let me come withineighty yards and then turned his head and stared at me preparatory torunning away</s>  i lifted the rifle and taking him about midway down theshoulder for he was side on to me fired</s>  i never made a cleaner shotor a better kill in all my small experience for the great buck sprangright up into the air and fell dead</s>  the bearers who had all halted tosee the performance gave a murmur of surprise an unwonted complimentfrom these sullen people who never appear to be surprised at anythingand a party of the guard at once ran off to cut the animal up</s>  as formyself though i was longing to have a look at him i sauntered backto my litter as though i had been in the habit of killing eland all mylife feeling that i had gone up several degrees in the estimationof the amahagger who looked on the whole thing as a very highclassmanifestation of witchcraft</s>  as a matter of fact however i hadnever seen an eland in a wild state before</s>  billali received me withenthusiasm</s> it is wonderful my son the baboon he cried wonderful</s>  thou arta very great man though so ugly</s>  had i not seen surely i would neverhave believed</s>  and thou sayest that thou wilt teach me to slay in thisfashion</s> certainly my father i said airily it is nothing</s> but all the same i firmly made up my mind that when my father billalibegan to fire i would without fail lie down or take refuge behind atree</s> after this little incident nothing happened of any note till about anhour and a half before sundown when we arrived beneath the shadow ofthe towering volcanic mass that i have already described</s>  it is quiteimpossible for me to describe its grim grandeur as it appeared to mewhile my patient bearers toiled along the bed of the ancient watercoursetowards the spot where the rich brownhued cliff shot up from precipiceto precipice till its crown lost itself in a cloud</s>  all i can say isthat it almost awed me by the intensity of its lonesome and most solemngreatness</s>  on we went up the bright and sunny slope till at last thecreeping shadows from above swallowed up its brightness and presentlywe began to pass through a cutting hewn in the living rock</s>  deeperand deeper grew this marvellous work which must i should say haveemployed thousands of men for many years</s>  indeed how it was everexecuted at all without the aid of blastingpowder or dynamite i cannotto this day imagine</s>  it is and must remain one of the mysteries of thatwild land</s>  i can only suppose that these cuttings and the vast cavesthat had been hollowed out of the rocks they pierced were the stateundertakings of the people of kr who lived here in the dim lostages of the world and as in the case of the egyptian monuments wereexecuted by the forced labour of tens of thousands of captives carriedon through an indefinite number of centuries</s>  but who were the people</s> at last we reached the face of the precipice itself and found ourselveslooking into the mouth of a dark tunnel that forcibly reminded me ofthose undertaken by our nineteenthcentury engineers in the constructionof railway lines</s>  out of this tunnel flowed a considerable stream ofwater</s>  indeed though i do not think that i have mentioned it we hadfollowed this stream which ultimately developed into the river i havealready described as winding away to the right from the spot wherethe cutting in the solid rock commenced</s>  half of this cutting formed achannel for the stream and half which was placed on a slightly higherleveleight feet perhapswas devoted to the purposes of a roadway</s>  atthe termination of the cutting however the stream turned off acrossthe plain and followed a channel of its own</s>  at the mouth of the cavethe cavalcade was halted and while the men employed themselves inlighting some earthenware lamps they had brought with them billalidescending from his litter informed me politely but firmly that theorders of she were that we were now to be blindfolded so that weshould not learn the secret of the paths through the bowels of themountains</s>  to this i of course assented cheerfully enough but jobwho was now very much better notwithstanding the journey did not likeit at all fancying i believe that it was but a preliminary step tobeing hotpotted</s>  he was however a little consoled when i pointed outto him that there were no hot pots at hand and so far as i knew nofire to heat them in</s>  as for poor leo after turning restlessly forhours he had to my deep thankfulness at last dropped off into a sleepor stupor i do not know which so there was no need to blindfold him</s> the blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the yellowish linenwhereof those of the amahagger who condescended to wear anything inparticular made their dresses tightly round the eyes</s>  this linen iafterwards discovered was taken from the tombs and was not as i had atfirst supposed of native manufacture</s>  the bandage was then knotted atthe back of the head and finally brought down again and the ends boundunder the chin to prevent its slipping</s>  ustane was by the way alsoblindfolded i do not know why unless it was from fear that she shouldimpart the secrets of the route to us</s> this operation performed we started on once more and soon by theechoing sound of the footsteps of the bearers and the increased noiseof the water caused by reverberation in a confined space i knew thatwe were entering into the bowels of the great mountain</s>  it was an eeriesensation being borne along into the dead heart of the rock we knew notwhither but i was getting used to eerie sensations by this time and bynow was pretty well prepared for anything</s>  so i lay still and listenedto the tramp tramp of the bearers and the rushing of the water andtried to believe that i was enjoying myself</s>  presently the men set upthe melancholy little chant that i had heard on the first night when wewere captured in the whaleboat and the effect produced by their voiceswas very curious and quite indescribable</s>  after a while the air beganto get exceedingly thick and heavy so much so indeed that i felt asthough i were going to choke till at length the litter took a sharpturn then another and another and the sound of the running waterceased</s>  after this the air was fresher again but the turns werecontinuous and to me blindfolded as i was most bewildering</s>  i triedto keep a map of them in my mind in case it might ever be necessaryfor us to try and escape by this route but needless to say failedutterly</s>  another halfhour or so passed and then suddenly i becameaware that we were once more in the open air</s>  i could see the lightthrough my bandage and feel its freshness on my face</s>  a few more minutesand the caravan halted and i heard billali order ustane to remove herbandage and undo ours</s>  without waiting for her attentions i got the knotof mine loose and looked out</s> as i anticipated we had passed right through the precipice and werenow on the farther side and immediately beneath its beetling face</s>  thefirst thing i noticed was that the cliff is not nearly so high here notso high i should say by five hundred feet which proved that the bed ofthe lake or rather of the vast ancient crater in which we stood wasmuch above the level of the surrounding plain</s>  for the rest we foundourselves in a huge rocksurrounded cup not unlike that of the firstplace where we had sojourned only ten times the size</s>  indeed i couldonly just make out the frowning line of the opposite cliffs</s>  a greatportion of the plain thus enclosed by nature was cultivated and fencedin with walls of stone placed there to keep the cattle and goats ofwhich there were large herds about from breaking into the gardens</s> here and there rose great grass mounds and some miles away towards thecentre i thought that i could see the outline of colossal ruins</s>  i hadno time to observe anything more at the moment for we were instantlysurrounded by crowds of amahagger similar in every particular to thosewith whom we were already familiar who though they spoke littlepressed round us so closely as to obscure the view to a person lyingin a hammock</s>  then all of a sudden a number of armed men arranged incompanies and marshalled by officers who held ivory wands in theirhands came running swiftly towards us having so far as i couldmake out emerged from the face of the precipice like ants from theirburrows</s>  these men as well as their officers were all robed in additionto the usual leopard skin and as i gathered formed the bodyguard ofshe herself</s> their leader advanced to billali saluted him by placing his ivory wandtransversely across his forehead and then asked some question whichi could not catch and billali having answered him the whole regimentturned and marched along the side of the cliff our cavalcade of littersfollowing in their track</s>  after going thus for about half a mile wehalted once more in front of the mouth of a tremendous cave measuringabout sixty feet in height by eighty wide and here billali descendedfinally and requested job and myself to do the same</s>  leo of coursewas far too ill to do anything of the sort</s>  i did so and we entered thegreat cave into which the light of the setting sun penetrated forsome distance while beyond the reach of the daylight it was faintlyilluminated with lamps which seemed to me to stretch away for an almostimmeasurable distance like the gas lights of an empty london street</s> the first thing i noticed was that the walls were covered withsculptures in basrelief of a sort pictorially speaking similar tothose that i have described upon the vaseslovescenes principallythen hunting pictures pictures of executions and the torture ofcriminals by the placing of a presumably redhot pot upon the headshowing whence our hosts had derived this pleasant practice</s>  therewere very few battlepieces though many of duels and men running andwrestling and from this fact i am led to believe that this people werenot much subject to attack by exterior foes either on account of theisolation of their position or because of their great strength</s>  betweenthe pictures were columns of stone characters of a formation absolutelynew to me at any rate they were neither greek nor egyptian norhebrew nor assyrianthat i am sure of</s>  they looked more like chinesewritings than any other that i am acquainted with</s>  near to the entranceof the cave both pictures and writings were worn away but further inthey were in many cases absolutely fresh and perfect as the day on whichthe sculptor had ceased work on them</s> the regiment of guards did not come further than the entrance to thecave where they formed up to let us pass through</s>  on entering the placeitself we were however met by a man robed in white who bowed humblybut said nothing which as it afterwards appeared that he was a deafmute was not very wonderful</s> running at right angles to the great cave at a distance of some twentyfeet from the entrance was a smaller cave or wide gallery that waspierced into the rock both to the right and to the left of the maincavern</s>  in front of the gallery to our left stood two guards from whichcircumstance i argued that it was the entrance to the apartments ofshe herself</s>  the mouth of the righthand gallery was unguarded andalong it the mute indicated that we were to go</s>  walking a few yards downthis passage which was lighted with lamps we came to the entrance ofa chamber having a curtain made of some grass material not unlike azanzibar mat in appearance hung over the doorway</s>  this the mute drewback with another profound obeisance and led the way into a goodsizedapartment hewn of course out of the solid rock but to my greatrelief lighted by means of a shaft pierced in the face of the precipice</s> in this room was a stone bedstead pots full of water for washing andbeautifully tanned leopard skins to serve as blankets</s> here we left leo who was still sleeping heavily and with him stoppedustane</s>  i noticed that the mute gave her a very sharp look as muchas to say who are you and by whose order do you come here</s>  then heconducted us to another similar room which job took and then to twomore that were respectively occupied by billali and myself</s> xiishethe first care of job and myself after seeing to leo was to washourselves and put on clean clothing for what we were wearing had notbeen changed since the loss of the dhow</s>  fortunately as i think thati have said by far the greater part of our personal baggage had beenpacked into the whaleboat and was therefore savedand brought hitherby the bearersalthough all the stores laid in by us for barter andpresents to the natives was lost</s>  nearly all our clothing was made of awellshrunk and very strong grey flannel and excellent i found it fortravelling in these places because though a norfolk jacket shirtand pair of trousers of it only weighed about four pounds a greatconsideration in a tropical country where every extra ounce tells onthe wearer it was warm and offered a good resistance to the rays ofthe sun and best of all to chills which are so apt to result fromsudden changes of temperature</s> never shall i forget the comfort of the wash and brushup and ofthose clean flannels</s>  the only thing that was wanting to complete my joywas a cake of soap of which we had none</s> afterwards i discovered that the amahagger who do not reckon dirt amongtheir many disagreeable qualities use a kind of burnt earth for washingpurposes which though unpleasant to the touch till one gets accustomedto it forms a very fair substitute for soap</s> by the time that i was dressed and had combed and trimmed my blackbeard the previous condition of which was certainly sufficientlyunkempt to give weight to billalis appellation for me of baboon ibegan to feel most uncommonly hungry</s>  therefore i was by no means sorrywhen without the slightest preparatory sound or warning the curtainover the entrance to my cave was flung aside and another mute ayoung girl this time announced to me by signs that i could notmisunderstandthat is by opening her mouth and pointing down itthatthere was something ready to eat</s>  accordingly i followed her into thenext chamber which we had not yet entered where i found job who hadalso to his great embarrassment been conducted thither by a fair mute</s> job never got over the advances the former lady had made towards himand suspected every girl who came near to him of similar designs</s> these young parties have a way of looking at one sir he would sayapologetically which i dont call respectable</s> this chamber was twice the size of the sleeping caves and i saw at oncethat it had originally served as a refectory and also probably as anembalming room for the priests of the dead for i may as well say atonce that these hollowedout caves were nothing more nor less than vastcatacombs in which for tens of ages the mortal remains of the greatextinct race whose monuments surrounded us had been first preservedwith an art and a completeness that has never since been equalledand then hidden away for all time</s>  on each side of this particularrockchamber was a long and solid stone table about three feet wide bythree feet six in height hewn out of the living rock of which it hadformed part and was still attached to at the base</s>  these tables wereslightly hollowed out or curved inward to give room for the knees ofany one sitting on the stone ledge that had been cut for a bench alongthe side of the cave at a distance of about two feet from them</s>  each ofthem also was so arranged that it ended right under a shaft piercedin the rock for the admission of light and air</s>  on examining themcarefully however i saw that there was a difference between them thathad at first escaped my attention viz</s>  that one of the tables thatto the left as we entered the cave had evidently been used not toeat upon but for the purposes of embalming</s>  that this was beyond allquestion the case was clear from five shallow depressions in the stoneof the table all shaped like a human form with a separate placefor the head to lie in and a little bridge to support the neck eachdepression being of a different size so as to fit bodies varying instature from a fullgrown mans to a small childs and with littleholes bored at intervals to carry off fluid</s>  and indeed if any furtherconfirmation was required we had but to look at the wall of the caveabove to find it</s>  for there sculptured all round the apartment andlooking nearly as fresh as the day it was done was the pictorialrepresentation of the death embalming and burial of an old man with along beard probably an ancient king or grandee of this country</s> the first picture represented his death</s>  he was lying upon a couch whichhad four short curved posts at the corners coming to a knob at the endin appearance something like written notes of music and was evidentlyin the very act of expiring</s>  gathered round the couch were women andchildren weeping the former with their hair hanging down their backs</s> the next scene represented the embalmment of the body which lay starkupon a table with depressions in it similar to the one before usprobably indeed it was a picture of the same table</s>  three men wereemployed at the workone superintending one holding a funnel shapedexactly like a port wine strainer of which the narrow end was fixed inan incision in the breast no doubt in the great pectoral artery whilethe third who was depicted as standing straddlelegged over the corpseheld a kind of large jug high in his hand and poured from it somesteaming fluid which fell accurately into the funnel</s>  the most curiouspart of this sculpture is that both the man with the funnel and theman who pours the fluid are drawn holding their noses either i supposebecause of the stench arising from the body or more probably to keepout the aromatic fumes of the hot fluid which was being forced into thedead mans veins</s>  another curious thing which i am unable to explain isthat all three men were represented as having a band of linen tied roundthe face with holes in it for the eyes</s> the third sculpture was a picture of the burial of the deceased</s>  therehe was stiff and cold clothed in a linen robe and laid out on a stoneslab such as i had slept upon at our first sojourningplace</s>  at hishead and feet burnt lamps and by his side were placed several ofthe beautiful painted vases that i have described which were perhapssupposed to be full of provisions</s>  the little chamber was crowded withmourners and with musicians playing on an instrument resembling a lyrewhile near the foot of the corpse stood a man holding a sheet withwhich he was preparing to cover it from view</s> these sculptures looked at merely as works of art were so remarkablethat i make no apology for describing them rather fully</s>  they struckme also as being of surpassing interest as representing probably withstudious accuracy the last rites of the dead as practised amongan utterly lost people and even then i thought how envious someantiquarian friends of my own at cambridge would be if ever i found anopportunity of describing these wonderful remains to them</s>  probably theywould say that i was exaggerating notwithstanding that every page ofthis history must bear so much internal evidence of its truth that itwould obviously have been quite impossible for me to have invented it</s> to return</s>  as soon as i had hastily examined these sculptures whichi think i omitted to mention were executed in relief we sat down to avery excellent meal of boiled goatsflesh fresh milk and cakes madeof meal the whole being served upon clean wooden platters</s> when we had eaten we returned to see how leo was getting on billalisaying that he must now wait upon she and hear her commands</s>  onreaching leos room we found the poor boy in a very bad way</s>  he had wokeup from his torpor and was altogether off his head babbling about someboatrace on the cam and was inclined to be violent</s>  indeed when weentered the room ustane was holding him down</s>  i spoke to him and myvoice seemed to soothe him at any rate he grew much quieter and waspersuaded to swallow a dose of quinine</s> i had been sitting with him for an hour perhapsat any rate i knowthat it was getting so dark that i could only just make out his headlying like a gleam of gold upon the pillow we had extemporised out of abag covered with a blanketwhen suddenly billali arrived with an airof great importance and informed me that she herself had deigned toexpress a wish to see mean honour he added accorded to but veryfew</s>  i think that he was a little horrified at my cool way of taking thehonour but the fact was that i did not feel overwhelmed with gratitudeat the prospect of seeing some savage dusky queen however absoluteand mysterious she might be more especially as my mind was full ofdear leo for whose life i began to have great fears</s>  however i rose tofollow him and as i did so i caught sight of something bright lying onthe floor which i picked up</s>  perhaps the reader will remember that withthe potsherd in the casket was a composition scarabus marked with around o a goose and another curious hieroglyphic the meaning of whichis suten se ra or royal son of the sun</s>  the scarab which is a verysmall one leo had insisted upon having set in a massive gold ring suchas is generally used for signets and it was this very ring that i nowpicked up</s>  he had pulled it off in the paroxysm of his fever at leasti suppose so and flung it down upon the rockfloor</s>  thinking that if ileft it about it might get lost i slipped it on my own little fingerand then followed billali leaving job and ustane with leo</s> we passed down the passage crossed the great aislelike cave and cameto the corresponding passage on the other side at the mouth of whichthe guards stood like two statues</s>  as we came they bowed their heads insalutation and then lifting their long spears placed them transverselyacross their foreheads as the leaders of the troop that had met ushad done with their ivory wands</s>  we stepped between them and foundourselves in an exactly similar gallery to that which led to our ownapartments only this passage was comparatively speaking brilliantlylighted</s>  a few paces down it we were met by four mutestwo men and twowomenwho bowed low and then arranged themselves the women in frontand the men behind of us and in this order we continued our processionpast several doorways hung with curtains resembling those leading toour own quarters and which i afterwards found opened out into chambersoccupied by the mutes who attended on she</s>  a few paces more and wecame to another doorway facing us and not to our left like the otherswhich seemed to mark the termination of the passage</s>  here two morewhite or rather yellowrobed guards were standing and they toobowed saluted and let us pass through heavy curtains into a greatantechamber quite forty feet long by as many wide in which some eightor ten women most of them young and handsome with yellowish hair saton cushions working with ivory needles at what had the appearance ofbeing embroidery frames</s>  these women were also deaf and dumb</s>  at thefarther end of this great lamplit apartment was another doorway closedin with heavy orientallooking curtains quite unlike those that hungbefore the doors of our own rooms and here stood two particularlyhandsome girl mutes their heads bowed upon their bosoms and their handscrossed in an attitude of humble submission</s>  as we advanced they eachstretched out an arm and drew back the curtains</s>  thereupon billali dida curious thing</s>  down he went that venerablelooking old gentlemanforbillali is a gentleman at the bottomdown on to his hands and kneesand in this undignified position with his long white beard trailing onthe ground he began to creep into the apartment beyond</s>  i followed himstanding on my feet in the usual fashion</s>  looking over his shoulder heperceived it</s> down my son down my baboon down on to thy hands and knees</s>  we enterthe presence of she and if thou art not humble of a surety she willblast thee where thou standest</s> i halted and felt scared</s>  indeed my knees began to give way of theirown mere motion but reflection came to my aid</s>  i was an englishmanand why i asked myself should i creep into the presence of some savagewoman as though i were a monkey in fact as well as in name</s>  i would notand could not do it that is unless i was absolutely sure that my lifeor comfort depended upon it</s>  if once i began to creep upon my knees ishould always have to do so and it would be a patent acknowledgment ofinferiority</s>  so fortified by an insular prejudice against kootooingwhich has like most of our socalled prejudices a good deal of commonsense to recommend it i marched in boldly after billali</s>  i found myselfin another apartment considerably smaller than the anteroom of whichthe walls were entirely hung with richlooking curtains of the same makeas those over the door the work as i subsequently discovered of themutes who sat in the antechamber and wove them in strips which wereafterwards sewn together</s>  also here and there about the room weresettees of a beautiful black wood of the ebony tribe inlaid with ivoryand all over the floor were other tapestries or rather rugs</s>  at the topend of this apartment was what appeared to be a recess also draped withcurtains through which shone rays of light</s>  there was nobody in theplace except ourselves</s> painfully and slowly old billali crept up the length of the cave andwith the most dignified stride that i could command i followed afterhim</s>  but i felt that it was more or less of a failure</s>  to begin with itis not possible to look dignified when you are following in the wakeof an old man writhing along on his stomach like a snake and thenin order to go sufficiently slowly either i had to keep my leg someseconds in the air at every step or else to advance with a full stopbetween each stride like mary queen of scots going to execution in aplay</s>  billali was not good at crawling i suppose his years stood in theway and our progress up that apartment was a very long affair</s>  i wasimmediately behind him and several times i was sorely tempted to helphim on with a good kick</s>  it is so absurd to advance into the presence ofsavage royalty after the fashion of an irishman driving a pig to marketfor that is what we looked like and the idea nearly made me burst outlaughing then and there</s>  i had to work off my dangerous tendency tounseemly merriment by blowing my nose a proceeding which filled oldbillali with horror for he looked over his shoulder and made a ghastlyface at me and i heard him murmur oh my poor baboon</s> at last we reached the curtains and here billali collapsed flat on tohis stomach with his hands stretched out before him as though he weredead and i not knowing what to do began to stare about the place</s>  butpresently i clearly felt that somebody was looking at me from behind thecurtains</s>  i could not see the person but i could distinctly feel hisor her gaze and what is more it produced a very odd effect upon mynerves</s>  i was frightened i do not know why</s>  the place was a strangeone it is true and looked lonely notwithstanding its rich hangingsand the soft glow of the lampsindeed these accessories added torather than detracted from its loneliness just as a lighted street atnight has always a more solitary appearance than a dark one</s>  it wasso silent in the place and there lay billali like one dead before theheavy curtains through which the odour of perfume seemed to float uptowards the gloom of the arched roof above</s>  minute grew into minute andstill there was no sign of life nor did the curtain move but i feltthe gaze of the unknown being sinking through and through me andfilling me with a nameless terror till the perspiration stood in beadsupon my brow</s> at length the curtain began to move</s>  who could be behind it</s> some nakedsavage queen a languishing oriental beauty or a nineteenthcenturyyoung lady drinking afternoon tea</s>  i had not the slightest ideaand should not have been astonished at seeing any of the three</s>  i wasgetting beyond astonishment</s>  the curtain agitated itself a little thensuddenly between its folds there appeared a most beautiful white handwhite as snow and with long tapering fingers ending in the pinkestnails</s>  the hand grasped the curtain and drew it aside and as it did soi heard a voice i think the softest and yet most silvery voice i everheard</s>  it reminded me of the murmur of a brook</s> stranger said the voice in arabic but much purer and more classicalarabic than the amahagger talkstranger wherefore art thou so muchafraid</s> now i flattered myself that in spite of my inward terrors i had kepta very fair command of my countenance and was therefore a littleastonished at this question</s>  before i had made up my mind how to answerit however the curtain was drawn and a tall figure stood before us</s>  isay a figure for not only the body but also the face was wrapped up insoft white gauzy material in such a way as at first sight to remind memost forcibly of a corpse in its graveclothes</s>  and yet i do not knowwhy it should have given me that idea seeing that the wrappings were sothin that one could distinctly see the gleam of the pink flesh beneaththem</s>  i suppose it was owing to the way in which they were arrangedeither accidentally or more probably by design</s>  anyhow i felt morefrightened than ever at this ghostlike apparition and my hair beganto rise upon my head as the feeling crept over me that i was in thepresence of something that was not canny</s>  i could however clearlydistinguish that the swathed mummylike form before me was that of atall and lovely woman instinct with beauty in every part and alsowith a certain snakelike grace which i had never seen anything toequal before</s>  when she moved a hand or foot her entire frame seemed toundulate and the neck did not bend it curved</s> why art thou so frightened stranger</s>  asked the sweet voice againavoice which seemed to draw the heart out of me like the strains ofsoftest music</s>  is there that about me that should affright a man</s>  thensurely are men changed from what they used to be</s>  and with a littlecoquettish movement she turned herself and held up one arm so asto show all her loveliness and the rich hair of raven blackness thatstreamed in soft ripples down her snowy robes almost to her sandalledfeet</s> it is thy beauty that makes me fear oh queen i answered humblyscarcely knowing what to say and i thought that as i did so i heard oldbillali who was still lying prostrate on the floor mutter good mybaboon good</s> i see that men still know how to beguile us women with false words</s>  ahstranger she answered with a laugh that sounded like

 and she held thecurtain aside with her ivory hand to let me pass in</s> i entered shuddering</s>  this woman was very terrible</s>  within the curtainswas a recess about twelve feet by ten and in the

themwere grotesque enough some were ghastly some recalled thoughts andsensations that had for years been buried in the dbris of my pastlife</s>  but behind and above them all hovered the shape of that awfulwoman and through them gleamed the memory of her entrancing loveliness</s> up and down the cave i strodeup and down</s> suddenly i observed what i had not noticed before that there was anarrow aperture in the rocky wall</s>  i took up the lamp and examined itthe aperture led to a passage</s>  now i was still sufficiently sensibleto remember that it is not pleasant in such a situation as ours was tohave passages running into ones bedchamber from no one knows where</s>  ifthere are passages people can come up them they can come up when oneis asleep</s>  partly to see where it went to and partly from a restlessdesire to be doing something i followed the passage</s>  it led to a stonestair which i descended the stair ended in another passage or rathertunnel also hewn out of the bedrock and running so far as i couldjudge exactly beneath the gallery that led to the entrance of ourrooms and across the great central cave</s>  i went on down it it was assilent as the grave but still drawn by some sensation or attractionthat i cannot define i followed on my stockinged feet falling withoutnoise on the smooth and rocky floor</s>  when i had traversed some fiftyyards of space i came to another passage running at right angles andhere an awful thing happened to me the sharp draught caught my lampand extinguished it leaving me in utter darkness in the bowels of thatmysterious place</s>  i took a couple of strides forward so as to clear thebisecting tunnel being terribly afraid lest i should turn up it inthe dark if once i got confused as to the direction and then paused tothink</s>  what was i to do</s>  i had no match it seemed awful to attempt thatlong journey back through the utter gloom and yet i could not standthere all night and if i did probably it would not help me much forin the bowels of the rock it would be as dark at midday as at midnight</s> i looked back over my shouldernot a sight or a sound</s>  i peered forwardinto the darkness surely far away i saw something like the faint glowof fire</s>  perhaps it was a cave where i could get a lightat any rateit was worth investigating</s>  slowly and painfully i crept along thetunnel keeping my hand

curtains</s>  fifty pacesit was close at hand</s>  sixtyohgreat heaven</s> i was at the curtains and they did not hang close so i could seeclearly into the little cavern beyond them</s>  it had all the appearance ofbeing a tomb and was lit up by a fire that burnt in its centre with awhitish flame and without smoke</s>  indeed there to the left was a stoneshelf with a little ledge to it three inches or so high and on theshelf lay what i took to be a corpse at any rate it looked like onewith something white thrown over it</s>  to the right was a similar shelfon which lay some broidered coverings</s>  over the fire bent the figure ofa woman she was sideways to me and facing the corpse wrapped in a darkmantle that hid her like a nuns cloak</s>  she seemed to be staring at theflickering flame</s>  suddenly as i was trying to make up my mind whatto do with a convulsive movement that somehow gave an impression ofdespairing energy the woman rose to her feet and cast the dark cloakfrom her</s> it was she herself</s> she was clothed as i had seen her when she unveiled in the kirtle ofclinging white cut low upon her bosom and bound in at the waist withthe barbaric doubleheaded snake and as before her rippling blackhair fell in heavy masses down her back</s>  but her face was what caught myeye and held me as in a vice not this time by the force of its beautybut by the power of fascinated terror</s>  the beauty was still thereindeed but the agony the blind passion and the awful vindictivenessdisplayed upon those quivering features and in the tortured look of theupturned eyes were such as surpass my powers of description</s> for a moment she stood still her hands raised high above her head andas she did so the white robe slipped from her down to her golden girdlebaring the blinding loveliness of her form</s>  she stood there her fingersclenched and the awful look of malevolence gathered and deepened on herface</s> suddenly i thought of what would happen if she discovered me and thereflection made me turn sick and faint</s>  but even if i had known that imust die if i stopped i do not believe that i could have moved fori was absolutely fascinated</s>  but still i knew my danger</s>  supposing sheshould hear me or see me through the curtain supposing i even sneezedor that her magic told her that she was being watchedswift indeedwould be my doom</s> down came the clenched hands to her sides then up again above her headand as i am a living and honourable man the white flame of the fireleapt up after them almost to the roof throwing a fierce and ghastlyglare upon she herself upon the white figure beneath the coveringand every scroll and detail of the rockwork</s> down came the ivory arms again and as they did so she spoke or ratherhissed in

abandoning the hissing tonecried aloudwhat is the use of cursing</s> she prevailed and she is gone</s> then she recommenced with an even more frightful energycurse her where she is</s>  let my curses reach her where she is anddisturb her rest</s> curse her through the starry spaces</s>  let her shadow be accursed</s> let my power find her even there</s> let her hear me even there</s>  let her hide

flame rose and fell reflecting itself in her agonisedeyes the hissing sound of her terrible maledictions and no words ofmine can convey how terrible they were ran round the walls and diedaway in

corpse sothat thou standest there before me as of old</s>  i can do it and sheheld out her hands over the sheeted dead while her whole frame becamerigid and terrible to see and her eyes grew fixed and

she said gloomily</s>  of what good is it to recall thesemblance of life when i cannot recall the spirit</s>  even if thou stoodestbefore me thou wouldst not know me and couldst but do what i bid thee</s> the life in thee would be my life and not thy life kallikrates</s> for a moment she stood there brooding and then cast herself down on herknees beside the form and began to press her lips against the sheetand weep</s>  there was something so horrible about the sight of thisaweinspiring woman letting loose her passion on the deadso much morehorrible even than anything that had gone

passing up it i gained my chamber in safety andflinging myself on the couch was soon lost in slumber or rather stupor</s> xvayesha gives judgmentthe next thing that i remember was opening my eyes and perceiving theform of job who had now practically recovered from his attack of fever</s> he was standing in the ray of light that pierced into the cave fromthe outer air shaking out my clothes as a

were not hotpotted by the amahagger it would bequite impossible for us to find our way across the network of marsheswhich stretching for scores and scores of miles formed a stronger andmore impassable fortification round the various amahagger householdsthan any that could be built or designed by man</s>  no there was butone thing to doface it out and speaking for my own part i was sointensely

those who would have smittenthee and the lion</s>  come on my son come swiftly</s> i turned and followed him down the passage and when we reached thegreat central cave saw that many amahagger some robed and some merelyclad in the sweet simplicity of a leopard skin were hurrying alongit</s>  we mingled with the throng and walked up the enormous and indeedalmost interminable cave</s>  all the way its walls were elaboratelysculptured and every twenty paces or so passages opened out of it atright angles leading billali told me to tombs hollowed in the rockby the people who were before</s>  nobody visited those tombs now hesaid and i must say that my heart rejoiced when i thought of theopportunities of antiquarian research which opened out before me</s>
at last we came to the head of the cave where there was a rock dasalmost exactly similar to the one on which we had been so furiouslyattacked a fact that proved to me that these das must have been usedas altars probably for the celebration of religious ceremonies andmore especially of rites connected with the interment of the dead</s>  oneither side of this das were passages leading billali informed me toother caves full of dead bodies</s>  indeed he added the whole mountainis full of dead and nearly all of them are perfect</s> in front of the das were gathered a great number of people of bothsexes who stood staring about in their peculiar gloomy fashion whichwould have reduced mark tapley himself to misery in about five minutes</s> on the das was a rude chair of black wood inlaid with ivory havinga seat made of grass fibre and a footstool formed of a wooden slabattached to the framework of the chair</s> suddenly there was a cry of hiya</s>  hiya</s>  she</s>  she</s>  and thereuponthe entire crowd of spectators instantly precipitated itself upon theground and lay still as though it were individually and collectivelystricken dead leaving me standing there like some solitary survivor ofa massacre</s>  as it did so a long string of guards began to defile from apassage to the left and ranged themselves on either side of the das</s> then followed about a score of male mutes then as many women mutesbearing lamps and then a tall white figure swathed from head to footin whom i recognised she herself</s>  she mounted the das and sat downupon the chair and spoke to me in greek i suppose because she didnot wish those present to understand what she said</s> come hither oh holly she said and sit thou at my feet and see medo justice on those who would have slain thee</s>  forgive me if my greekdoth halt like a lame man it is so long since i have heard the sound ofit that my tongue is stiff and will not bend rightly to the words</s> i bowed and mounting the das sat down at her feet</s> how hast thou slept my holly</s>  she asked</s> i slept not well oh ayesha</s>  i answered with perfect truth and withan inward fear that perhaps she knew how i had passed

ayesha</s>  i asked indifferently</s> i dreamed she answered quickly of one i hate and one i love andthen as though to turn the conversation she addressed the captain ofher guard in arabic let the men be brought before me</s> the captain bowed low for the guard and her attendants did notprostrate themselves but had remained standing and departed with hisunderlings down a passage to the right</s> then came a silence</s>  she leaned her swathed head upon her hand andappeared to be lost in thought while the multitude before her continuedto grovel upon their stomachs only screwing their heads round a littleso as to get a view of us with one eye</s>  it seemed that their queenso rarely appeared in public that they were willing to undergo thisinconvenience and even graver risks to have the opportunity of lookingon her or rather on her garments for no living man there except myselfhad ever seen her face</s>  at last we caught sight of the waving of lightsand heard the tramp of men coming along the passage and in filed theguard and with them the survivors of our wouldbe murderers to thenumber of twenty or more on whose countenances a natural expression ofsullenness struggled with the terror that evidently filled their savagehearts</s>  they were ranged in front of the das and would have castthemselves down on the floor of the cave like the spectators but shestopped them</s> nay she said in her softest voice stand i pray you stand</s> perchance the time will soon be when ye shall grow weary of beingstretched out and she laughed melodiously</s> i saw a cringe of terror run

her voice hadthe power of suiting itself in a wonderful manner to the mood of themoment</s>  what have ye to say ye rebellious children why vengeanceshould not be done upon you</s> for some time there was no answer but at last one of the men a finebroadchested fellow well on in middlelife with deepgraven featuresand an eye like a hawks spoke and said that the orders that they hadreceived were not to harm the white men nothing was said of theirblack servant so egged on thereto by a woman who was now dead theyproceeded to try to hotpot him after the ancient and honourable customof their country with a view of eating him in due course</s>  as for theirsudden attack upon ourselves it was made in an access of sudden furyand they deeply regretted it</s>  he ended by humbly praying that they mightbe banished into the swamps to live and die as it might chance but isaw it written on his face that he had but little hope of mercy</s> then came a pause and the most intense silence reigned over the wholescene which illuminated as it was by the flicker of the lamps strikingout broad patterns of light and shadow upon the rocky walls was asstrange as any i ever saw even in that unholy land</s>  upon the groundbefore the das were stretched scores of the corpselike forms of thespectators till at last the long lines of them were lost in thegloomy background</s>  before this outstretched audience were the knotsof evildoers trying to cover up their natural terrors with a braveappearance of unconcern</s>  on the right and left stood the silent guardsrobed in white and armed with great spears and daggers and men andwomen mutes watching with hard curious eyes</s>  then seated in herbarbaric chair above them all with myself at her feet was the veiledwhite woman whose loveliness and awesome power seemed to visibly shineabout her like a halo or rather like the glow from some unseen light</s> never have i seen her veiled shape look more terrible than it did inthat space while she

only objects in the cave itself were slabs of  rock arranged in various positions to facilitate the  operations of the torturers</s>  many of these slabs which were  of a porous stone were stained quite dark with the blood of  ancient victims that had soaked into them</s>  also in the  centre of the room was a place for a furnace with a cavity  wherein to heat the historic pot</s>  but the most dreadful  thing about the cave was that over each slab was a  sculptured illustration of the appropriate torture being  applied</s>  these sculptures were so awful that i will not  harrow the reader by attempting a description of them</s> l</s>   h</s>  h</s> she ceased and a faint murmur of horror ran round the cave</s>  as for thevictims as soon as they realised the full hideousness of their doomtheir stoicism forsook them and they flung themselves down upon theground and wept and implored for mercy in a way that was dreadful tobehold</s>  i too turned to ayesha and begged her to spare them or atleast to mete out their fate in some less awful way</s>  but she was hard asadamant about it</s> my holly she said again speaking in greek which to tell the truthalthough i have always been

prisoners had been removed ayesha waved her hand and thespectators turned round and began to crawl off down the cave like ascattered flock of sheep</s>  when they were a fair distance from the dashowever they rose and walked away leaving the queen and myself alonewith the exception of the mutes and the few remaining guards most ofwhom had departed with the doomed men</s>  thinking this a good opportunityi asked she to come and see leo telling her of his serious conditionbut she would not saying that he certainly would not die before thenight as people never died of that sort of fever

rose from her chair andmaking some signs to the mutes descended from the das</s>  thereon fourof the girls took lamps and ranged themselves two in front and twobehind us but the others went away as

holly</s>  this people was an old people before the egyptianswere</s>  a little can i read of their inscriptions having found the keytheretoand see thou here this was one of the last of the caves

 it struck meat once that his features were exceedingly like those of the man who wasrepresented as being embalmed in the chamber where we took our meals</s> beneath the chair which by the way was shaped exactly like the onein which ayesha had sat to give judgment was a short inscription in theextraordinary characters of which i have already spoke but which i donot remember sufficient of to illustrate</s>  it looked more like chinesewriting than any other that i am acquainted with</s>  this inscriptionayesha proceeded with some difficulty and hesitation to read aloud andtranslate</s>  it ran as followsin the year four thousand two hundred and fiftynine from the foundingof the city of imperial kr was this cave or burial place completedby tisno king of kr the people thereof and their

therefore how old must thatcity have been</s>  and now follow thou me and i will show thee after whatfashion this great people fell when the time was come for it to falland she led the way down to the

down which the coals are thrown</s>  thou seestshe said</s>  tell me what is it</s> nay i know not i answered whereon she crossed to the lefthand sideof the cave looking towards the entrance and signed to the mutes tohold up the lamps</s>  on the wall was something painted with a red pigmentin similar characters to those hewn beneath the sculpture of tisno kingof kr</s>  this inscription she proceeded to translate to me the pigmentstill being fresh enough to show the form of the letters</s>  it ran thusi junis a priest of the great temple of kr write this upon therock of the buryingplace

merry till their time came</s>  but comei will show thee the great pit beneath the cave whereof the writingspeaks</s>  never shall thine eyes witness such another sight</s>    the name of the race amahagger would seem to indicate a  curious mingling of races such as might easily have occurred  in the neighbourhood of the zambesi</s>  the prefix ama is  common to the zulu and kindred races and signifies  people while hagger is an arabic word meaning a stone</s>   editor</s> accordingly i followed her to a side passage opening out of the maincave then down a great number of steps and along an underground shaftwhich cannot have been less than sixty feet beneath the surface of therock and was ventilated by curious borings that ran upward i know notwhere</s>  suddenly the passage ended and she halted and bade the muteshold up the lamps and as she had prophesied i saw a scene such asi was not likely to see again</s>  we were standing in an enormous pit orrather on the brink of it for it went down deeperi do not know howmuchthan the level on which we stood and was edged in with a low wallof rock</s>  so far as i could judge this pit was about the size of thespace beneath the dome of st</s>  pauls in london and when the lamps wereheld up i saw that it was nothing but one vast charnelhouse beingliterally full of thousands of human skeletons which lay piled up in anenormous gleaming pyramid formed by the slipping down of the bodiesat the apex as fresh ones were dropped in from above</s>  anything moreappalling than this jumbled mass of the remains of a departed race icannot imagine and what made it even more dreadful was that in thisdry air a considerable number of the bodies had simply become desiccatedwith the skin still on them and now fixed in every conceivableposition stared at us out of the mountain of white bones grotesquelyhorrible caricatures of humanity</s>  in my astonishment i uttered anejaculation and the echoes of my voice ringing in the vaulted spacedisturbed a skull that had been accurately balanced for many thousandsof years near the apex of the pile</s>  down it came with a run boundingalong merrily towards us and of course bringing an avalanche of otherbones after it till at last the whole pit rattled with their movementeven as though the skeletons were getting up to greet us</s> come i said i have seen enough</s>  these are the bodies of those whodied of the great sickness is it not so</s>  i added as we turned away</s> yea</s>  the people of kr ever embalmed their dead as did the egyptiansbut their art was greater than the art of the egyptians for whereasthe egyptians disembowelled and drew the brain the people of krinjected fluid into the veins and thus reached every part</s>  but staythou shalt see and she halted at haphazard at one of the littledoorways opening out of the passage along which we were walking andmotioned to the mutes to light us in</s>  we entered into a small chambersimilar to the one in which i had slept at our first stoppingplaceonly instead of one there were two stone benches or beds in it</s>  on thebenches lay figures covered with yellow linen on which a fine andimpalpable dust had gathered in the course of ages but nothing like tothe extent that one would have anticipated for in these deephewn cavesthere is no material to turn to dust</s>  about the bodies on the stoneshelves and floor of the tomb were many painted vases but i saw veryfew ornaments or weapons in any of the vaults</s>    all the linen that the amahagger wore was taken from the  tombs which accounted for its yellow hue</s>  it was well  washed however and properly rebleached it acquired its  former snowy whiteness and was the softest and best linen i  ever saw</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> uplift the cloths oh holly said ayesha but when i put out my handto do so i drew it back again</s>  it seemed like sacrilege and to speakthe truth i was awed by the dread solemnity of the place and of thepresences before us</s>  then with a little laugh at my fears she drewthem herself only to discover other and yet finer cloths lying over theforms upon the stone bench</s>  these also she withdrew and then for thefirst time for thousands upon thousands of years did living eyes look uponthe face of that chilly dead</s>  it was a woman she might have beenthirtyfive years of age or perhaps a little less and had certainlybeen beautiful</s>  even now her calm clearcut features marked out withdelicate eyebrows and long eyelashes which threw little lines of theshadow of the

long grizzled beardand also robed in white probably the husband of the lady who aftersurviving her many years came at the last to sleep once more for goodand all beside her</s> we left the place and entered others</s>  it would be too long to describethe many things i saw in them</s>  each one had its occupants for the fivehundred and odd years that had elapsed between the completion of thecave

fill abook with the description of them but to do so would only be to repeatwhat i have said with variations</s> nearly all the bodies so masterfully was the art with which they hadbeen treated were as perfect as on the day of death thousands of yearsbefore</s>  nothing came to injure them in the deep silence of the livingrock they were beyond the reach of heat and cold and damp and thearomatic drugs with which they had been saturated were evidentlypractically everlasting in their effect</s>  here and there however we sawan exception and in these cases although the flesh looked sound enoughexternally if one touched it it fell in and revealed the fact that thefigure was but a pile of dust</s>  this arose ayesha told me from theseparticular bodies having either owing to haste in the burial orother causes been soaked in the preservative instead of its beinginjected into the substance of the flesh</s>    ayesha afterwards showed me the tree from the leaves of  which this ancient preservative was manufactured</s>  it is a  low bushlike tree that to this day grows in wonderful  plenty upon the sides of the mountains or rather upon the  slopes leading up to the rocky walls</s>  the leaves are long  and narrow a vivid green in colour but turning a bright  red in the autumn and not unlike those of a laurel in  general appearance</s>  they have little smell when green but  if boiled the aromatic odour from them is so strong that one  can hardly bear it</s>  the best mixture however was made from  the roots and among the people of kr there was a law  which ayesha showed me alluded to on some of the  inscriptions to the effect that on pain of heavy penalties  no one under a certain rank was to be embalmed with the  drugs prepared from the roots</s>  the object and effect of this  was of course to preserve the trees from extermination</s>   the sale of the leaves and roots was a government monopoly  and from it the kings of kr derived a large proportion of  their private revenue</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> about the last tomb we visited i must however say one word for itscontents spoke even more eloquently to the human sympathies than thoseof the first</s>  it had

hair streaming downher glittering against her garments snowy white and the bosom thatwas whiter than the robes even dimming with its lustre her ornamentsof burnished gold</s>  i seemed to see the great cave filled with warriorsbearded and clad in mail and on the lighted das where ayesha hadgiven judgment a man standing robed and surrounded by the symbols ofhis priestly office</s>  and up the cave there came one clad in purple andbefore him and behind him came minstrels and fair maidens chanting awedding song</s>  white stood the maid against the altar fairer thanthe fairest therepurer than a lily and more cold than the dew thatglistens in its heart</s>  but as the man drew near she shuddered</s>  then outof the press and throng there sprang a darkhaired youth and put hisarms about

theytore the youth from her arms and stabbed him but with a cry shesnatched the dagger from his belt and drove it into her snowy breasthome to the heart and down she fell and then with cries and

me originated in the huge pyramid of bones</s> i dreamed that they all stood up and marched past me in thousandsand tens of thousandsin squadrons companies and armieswith thesunlight shining through their hollow ribs</s>  on they rushed across theplain to kr their imperial home i saw the drawbridges fall beforethem and heard their bones clank through the brazen gates</s>  on theywent up the splendid streets on past fountains palaces and templessuch as the eye of man never saw</s>  but there was no man to greet them inthe marketplace and no womans face appeared at the windowsonlya bodiless voice went before them calling fallen is imperialkr</s> fallen</s> fallen</s>  fallen</s>  on right through the city marchedthose gleaming phalanxes and the rattle of their bony tread echoedthrough the silent air as they pressed grimly on</s>  they passed throughthe city and clomb the wall and marched along the great roadway thatwas made upon the wall till at length they once more reached thedrawbridge</s>  then as the sun was sinking they returned again towardstheir sepulchre and luridly his light shone in the sockets of theirempty eyes throwing gigantic shadows of their bones that stretchedaway and crept and crept like huge spiders legs as their armies woundacross the plain</s>  then they came to the cave and once more one by oneflung themselves in unending files through the hole into the pit ofbones and i awoke shuddering to see she who had evidently beenstanding between my couch and leos glide like a shadow from the room</s> after this i slept again soundly this time till morning when iawoke much refreshed and got up</s>  at last the hour drew near at whichaccording to ayesha leo was to awake and with it came she herselfas usual veiled</s> thou shalt see oh holly she said presently shall he awake in hisright mind the fever having left him</s> hardly were the words out of her mouth when leo turned round andstretched out his arms yawned opened his eyes and perceiving afemale form bending over him threw his arms round her and kissed hermistaking her perhaps for ustane</s>  at any rate he said in arabichullo ustane why have you tied your head up like that</s>  have you gotthe toothache</s>  and then in english i say im awfully hungry</s>  whyjob you old son of a gun where the deuce have we got to noweh</s> i am sure i wish i knew mr</s>  leo said job edging suspiciously pastayesha whom he still regarded with the utmost disgust and horror beingby no means sure that she was not an animated corpse but you mustnttalk mr</s>  leo youve been very ill and given us a great deal ofhanxiety and if this lady looking at ayesha would be so kind as tomove ill bring you your soup</s> this turned leos attention to the lady who was standing by inperfect silence</s>  hullo</s>  he said that is not ustanewhere isustane</s> then for the first time ayesha spoke to him and her first words werea lie</s>  she has gone from hence upon a visit she said and beholdin her place am i here as thine handmaiden</s> ayeshas silver notes seemed to puzzle leos halfawakened intellectas also did her corpselike wrappings</s>  however he said nothing at thetime but drank off his soup greedily enough and then turned over andslept again till the evening</s>  when he woke for the second time he sawme and began to question me as to what had happened but i had toput him off as best i could till the morrow when he awoke almostmiraculously better</s>  then i told him something of his illness and of mydoings but as ayesha was present i could not tell him much except thatshe was the queen of the country and well disposed towards us andthat it was her pleasure to go veiled for though of course i spoke inenglish i was afraid that she might understand what we were saying fromthe expression of our faces and besides i remembered her warning</s> on the following day leo got up almost entirely recovered</s>  the fleshwound in his side was healed and his constitution naturally a vigorousone had shaken off the exhaustion consequent on his terrible fever witha rapidity that i can only attribute to the effects of the wonderfuldrug which ayesha had given to him and also to the fact that hisillness had been too short to reduce him very much</s>  with his returninghealth came back full recollection of all his adventures up to the timewhen he had lost consciousness in the marsh and of course of ustanealso to whom i had discovered he had grown considerably attached</s> indeed he overwhelmed me with questions about the poor girl which idid not dare to answer for after leos first awakening she had sentfor me and again warned me solemnly that i was to reveal nothing of thestory to him delicately hinting that if i did it would be the worse forme</s>  she also for the second time cautioned me not to tell leo anythingmore than i was obliged about herself saying that she would revealherself to him in her own time</s> indeed her whole manner changed</s>  after all that i had seen i hadexpected that she would take the earliest opportunity of claiming theman she believed to be her oldworld lover but this for some reason ofher own which was at the time quite inscrutable to me she did not do</s> all that she did was to attend to his wants quietly and with a humilitywhich was in striking contrast with her former imperious bearingaddressing him always in a tone of something very like respect andkeeping him with her as much as possible</s>  of course his curiosity was asmuch excited about this mysterious woman as my own had been and he wasparticularly anxious to see her face which i had without enteringinto particulars told him was as lovely as her form and voice</s>  thisin itself was enough to raise the expectations of any young man to adangerous pitch and had it not been that he had not as yet completelyshaken off the effects of illness and was much troubled in his mindabout ustane of whose affection and brave devotion he spoke in touchingterms i have no doubt that he would have entered into her plans andfallen in love with her by anticipation</s>  as it was however he wassimply wildly curious and also like myself considerably awed forthough no hint had been given to him by ayesha of her extraordinary agehe not unnaturally came to identify her with the woman spoken of onthe potsherd</s>  at last quite driven into a corner by his continualquestions which he showered on me while he was dressing on this thirdmorning i referred him to ayesha saying with perfect truth that idid not know where ustane was</s>  accordingly after leo had eaten a heartybreakfast we adjourned into shes presence for her mutes had ordersto admit us at all hours</s> she was as usual seated in what for want of a better term we calledher boudoir and on the curtains being drawn she rose from her couchand stretching out both hands came forward to greet us or ratherleo for i as may be imagined was now quite left in the cold</s>  it wasa pretty sight to see her veiled form gliding towards the sturdy youngenglishman dressed in his grey flannel suit for though he is half agreek in blood leo is with the exception of his hair one of the mostenglishlooking men i ever saw</s>  he has nothing of the subtle form orslippery manner of the modern greek about him though i presume thathe got his remarkable personal beauty from his foreign mother whoseportrait he resembles not a little</s>  he is very tall and bigchested andyet not awkward as so many big men are and his head is set upon him insuch a fashion as to give him a proud and vigorous air which was welltranslated in his amahagger name of the lion</s> greeting to thee my young stranger lord she said in her softestvoice</s>  right glad am i to see thee upon thy feet</s>  believe me had i notsaved thee at the last never wouldst thou have stood upon those feetagain</s>  but the danger is done and it shall be my careand she flung aworld of meaning into the wordsthat it doth return no more</s> leo bowed to her and then in his best arabic thanked her for all herkindness and courtesy in caring for one unknown to her</s> nay she answered softly ill could the world spare such a man</s> beauty is too rare upon it</s>  give me no thanks who am made happy by thycoming</s> humph</s>  old fellow said leo aside to me in english the lady is verycivil</s>  we seem to have tumbled into clover</s>  i hope that you have madethe most of your opportunities</s>  by jove</s>  what a pair of arms she hasgot</s> i nudged him in the ribs to make him keep quiet for i caught sight of agleam from ayeshas veiled eyes which were regarding me curiously</s> i trust went on ayesha that my servants have attended well uponthee if there can be comfort in this poor place be sure it waits onthee</s>  is there aught that i can do for thee more</s> yes oh she answered leo hastily i would fain know whither theyoung lady who was looking after me has gone to</s> ah said ayesha the girlyes i saw her</s>  nay i know not shesaid that she would go i know not whither</s>  perchance she will returnperchance not</s>  it is wearisome waiting on the sick and these savagewomen are fickle</s> leo looked both sulky and distressed at this intelligence</s> its very odd he said to me in english and then addressing shei cannot understand he said the young lady and iwellin shortwe had a regard for each other</s> ayesha laughed a little very musically and then turned the subject</s> xixgive me a black goat</s> the conversation after this was of such a desultory order that i do notquite recollect it</s>  for some reason perhaps from a desire to keep heridentity and character in reserve ayesha did not talk freely as sheusually did</s>  presently however she informed leo that she had arrangeda dance that night for our amusement</s>  i was astonished to hear this asi fancied that the amahagger were much too gloomy a folk to indulgein any such frivolity but as will presently more clearly appearit turned out that an amahagger dance has little in common with suchfantastic festivities in other countries savage or civilised</s>  then aswe were about to withdraw she suggested that leo might like to seesome of the wonders of the caves and as he gladly assented thither wedeparted accompanied by job and billali</s>  to describe our visit wouldonly be to repeat a great deal of what i have already said</s>
 the tombswe entered were indeed different for the whole rock was a honeycomb ofsepulchres but the contents were nearly always similar</s>  afterwardswe visited the pyramid of bones that had haunted my dreams on theprevious night and from thence went down a long passage to one of thegreat vaults occupied by the bodies of the poorer citizens of imperialkr</s>  these bodies were not nearly so well preserved as were those ofthe wealthier classes</s>  many of them had no linen covering on them alsothey were buried from five hundred to one thousand in a single largevault the corpses in some instances being thickly piled one uponanother like a heap of slain</s>    for a long while it puzzled me to know what could have  been done with the enormous quantities of rock that must  have been dug out of these vast caves but i afterwards  discovered that it was for the most part built into the  walls and palaces of kr and also used to line the  reservoirs and sewers</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> leo was of course intensely interested in this stupendous and unequalledsight which was indeed enough to awake all the imagination a manhad in him into the most active life</s>  but to poor job it did notprove attractive</s>  his nervesalready seriously shaken by what he hadundergone since we had arrived in this terrible countrywere as maybe imagined still further disturbed by the spectacle of these masses ofdeparted humanity whereof the forms still remained perfect before hiseyes though their voices were for ever lost in the eternal silence ofthe tomb</s>  nor was he comforted when old billali by way of soothinghis evident agitation informed him that he should not be frightened ofthese dead things as he would soon be like them himself</s> theres a nice thing to say of a man sir he ejaculated when itranslated this little remark but there what can one expect of an oldmaneating savage</s>  not but what i dare say hes right and job sighed</s> when we had finished inspecting the caves we returned and had ourmeal for it was now past four in the afternoon and we allespeciallyleoneeded some food and rest</s>  at six oclock we together with jobwaited on ayesha who set to work to terrify our poor servant stillfurther by showing him pictures on the pool of water in the fontlikevessel</s>  she learnt from me that he was one of seventeen children andthen bid him think of all his brothers and sisters or as many of themas he could gathered together in his fathers cottage</s>  then she toldhim to look in the water and there reflected from its stilly surfacewas that dead scene of many years gone by as it was recalled to ourretainers brain</s>  some of the faces were clear enough but some weremere blurs and splotches or with one feature grossly exaggerated thefact being that in these instances job had been unable to recallthe exact appearances of the individuals or remembered them only by apeculiarity of his tribe and the water could only reflect what he sawwith his minds eye</s>  for it must be remembered that shes power inthis matter was strictly limited she could apparently except in veryrare instances only photograph upon the water what was actually in themind of some one present and then only by his will</s>  but if she waspersonally acquainted with a locality she could as in the case ofourselves and the whaleboat throw its reflection upon the water andalso it seems the reflection of anything extraneous that was passingthere at the time</s>  this power however did not extend to the mindsof others</s>  for instance she could show me the interior of my collegechapel as i remembered it but not as it was at the moment ofreflection for where other people were concerned her art was strictlylimited to the facts or memories present to their consciousness at themoment</s>  so much was this so that when we tried for her amusement toshow her pictures of noted buildings such as st</s>  pauls or the housesof parliament the result was most imperfect for of course though wehad a good general idea of their appearance we could not recall all thearchitectural details and therefore the minuti necessary to a perfectreflection were wanting</s>  but job could not be got to understand thisand so far from accepting a natural explanation of the matter whichwas after all though strange enough in all conscience nothing morethan an instance of glorified and perfected telepathy he set the wholething down as a manifestation of the blackest magic</s>  i shall neverforget the howl of terror which he uttered when he saw the more or lessperfect portraits of his longscattered brethren staring at him from thequiet water or the merry peal of laughter with which ayesha greeted hisconsternation</s>  as for leo he did not altogether like it either but ranhis fingers through his yellow curls and remarked that it gave him thecreeps</s> after about an hour of this amusement in the latter part of which jobdid not participate the mutes by signs indicated that billali waswaiting for an audience</s>  accordingly he was told to crawl up whichhe did as awkwardly as usual and announced that the dance was readyto begin if she and the white strangers would be pleased to attend</s> shortly afterwards we all rose and ayesha having thrown a dark cloakthe same by the way that she had worn when i saw her cursing by thefire over her white wrappings we started</s>  the dance was to be held inthe open air on the smooth rocky plateau in front of the great caveand thither we made our way</s>  about fifteen paces from the mouth of thecave we found three chairs placed and here we sat and waited for asyet no dancers were to be seen</s>  the night was almost but not quitedark the moon not having risen as yet which made us wonder how weshould be able to see the dancing</s> thou wilt presently understand said ayesha with a little laugh whenleo asked her and we certainly did</s>  scarcely were the words out of hermouth when from every point we saw dark forms rushing up each bearingwith him what we at first took to be an enormous flaming torch</s>  whateverthey were they were burning furiously for the flames stood out ayard or more behind each bearer</s>  on they came fifty or more of themcarrying their flaming burdens and looking like so many devils fromhell</s>  leo was the first to discover what these burdens were</s> great heaven</s>  he said they are corpses on fire</s> i stared and stared againhe was perfectly rightthe torches that wereto light our entertainment were human mummies from the caves</s> on rushed the bearers of the flaming corpses and meeting at a spotabout twenty paces in front of us built their ghastly burdens crosswaysinto a huge bonfire</s>  heavens</s>  how they roared and flared</s>  no tar barrelcould have burnt as those mummies did</s>  nor was this all</s>  suddenly isaw one great fellow seize a flaming human arm that had fallen from itsparent frame and rush off into the darkness</s>  presently he stopped anda tall streak of fire shot up into the air illumining the gloom andalso the lamp from which it sprang</s>  that lamp was the mummy of a womantied to a stout stake let into the rock and he had fired her hair</s>  onhe went a few paces and touched a second then a third and a fourthtill at last we were surrounded on all three sides by a great ring ofbodies flaring furiously the material with which they were preservedhaving rendered them so inflammable that the flames would literallyspout out of the ears and mouth in tongues of fire a foot or more inlength</s> nero illuminated his gardens with live christians soaked in tar andwe were now treated to a similar spectacle probably for the first timesince his day only happily our lamps were not living ones</s> but although this element of horror was fortunately wanting todescribe the awful and hideous grandeur of the spectacle thus presentedto us is i feel so absolutely beyond my poor powers that i scarcelydare attempt it</s>  to begin with it appealed to the moral as well as thephysical susceptibilities</s>  there was something very terrible and yetvery fascinating about the employment of the remote dead to illuminethe orgies of the living in itself the thing was a satire both on theliving and the dead</s>  csars dustor is it alexanders</s> may stop abunghole but the functions of these dead csars of the past was tolight up a savage fetish dance</s>  to such base uses may we come of solittle account may we be in the minds of the eager multitudes that weshall breed many of whom so far from revering our memory will live tocurse us for begetting them into such a world of woe</s> then there was the physical side of the spectacle and a weird andsplendid one it was</s>  those old citizens of kr burnt as to judge fromtheir sculptures and inscriptions they had lived very fast and withthe utmost liberality</s>  what is more there were plenty of them</s>  as soonas ever a mummy had burnt down to the ankles which it did in abouttwenty minutes the feet were kicked away and another one put in itsplace</s>  the bonfire was kept going on the same generous scale and itsflames shot up with a hiss and a crackle twenty or thirty feet intothe air throwing great flashes of light far out into the gloom throughwhich the dark forms of the amahagger flitted to and fro likedevils replenishing the infernal fires</s>  we all stood and staredaghastshocked and yet fascinated at so strange a spectacle and halfexpecting to see the spirits those flaming forms had once enclosed comecreeping from the shadows to work vengeance on their desecrators</s> i promised thee a strange sight my holly laughed ayesha whosenerves alone did not seem to be affected and behold i have notfailed thee</s>  also it hath its lesson</s>  trust not to the future forwho knows what the future may bring</s>  therefore live for the day andendeavour not to escape the dust which seems to be mans end</s>  whatthinkest thou those longforgotten nobles and ladies would have felt hadthey known that they should one day flare to light the dance or boil thepot of savages</s>  but see here come the dancers a merry creware theynot</s>  the stage is litnow for the play</s> as she spoke we perceived two lines of figures one male and the otherfemale to the number of about a hundred each advancing round the humanbonfire arrayed only in the usual leopard and buck skins</s>  they formedup in perfect silence in two lines facing each other between usand the fire and then the dancea sort of infernal and fiendishcancanbegan</s>  to describe it is quite impossible but though there wasa good deal of tossing of legs and doubleshuffling it seemed to ouruntutored minds to be more of a play than a dance and as usual withthis dreadful people whose minds seem to have taken their colour fromthe caves in which they live and whose jokes and amusements are drawnfrom the inexhaustible stores of preserved mortality with which theyshare their homes the subject appeared to be a most ghastly one</s>  iknow that it represented an attempted murder first of all and then theburial alive of the victim and his struggling from the grave each actof the abominable drama which was carried on in perfect silence beingrounded off and finished with a furious and most revolting dance roundthe supposed victim who writhed upon the ground in the red light of thebonfire</s> presently however this pleasing piece was interrupted</s>  suddenly therewas a slight commotion and a large powerful woman whom i had noted asone of the most vigorous of the dancers came made mad and drunken withunholy excitement bounding and staggering towards us shrieking out asshe camei want a black goat i must have a black goat bring me a blackgoat</s>  and down she fell upon the rocky floor foaming and writhing andshrieking for a black goat about as hideous a spectacle as can well beconceived</s> instantly most of the dancers came up and got round her though somestill continued their capers in the background</s> she has got a devil called out one of them</s>  run and get a blackgoat</s>  there devil keep quiet</s>  keep quiet</s>  you shall have the goatpresently</s>  they have gone to fetch it devil</s> i want a black goat i must have a black goat</s>  shrieked the foamingrolling creature again</s> all right devil the goat will be here presently

 oh</s>  oh</s>  oh</s>  give me theblood of the goat</s> at this moment a terrified bah</s>  announced that the poor goat had beensacrificed and the next minute a woman ran up with a saucer full ofblood</s>  this the possessed creature who was then raving and foaming herwildest seized and drank and was instantly recovered and withouta trace of hysteria or fits or being possessed or whatever dreadfulthing it was she was suffering from</s>  she stretched her arms smiledfaintly and walked quietly back to the dancers who presently withdrewin a double line as they had come leaving the space between us and thebonfire deserted</s> i thought that the entertainment was now over and feeling ratherqueer was about to ask she if we could rise when suddenly whatat first i took to be a baboon came hopping round the fire and wasinstantly met upon the other side by a lion or rather a human beingdressed in a lions skin</s>  then came a goat then a man wrapped in anoxs hide with the horns wobbling about in a ludicrous way</s>  after himfollowed a blesbok then an impala then a koodoo then more goats andmany other animals including a girl sewn up in the shining scaly hideof a boaconstrictor several yards of which trailed along the groundbehind her</s>  when all the beasts had collected they began to dance aboutin a lumbering unnatural fashion and to imitate the sounds producedby the respective animals they represented till the whole air was alivewith roars and bleating and the hissing of snakes</s>  this went on for along time till getting tired of the pantomime i asked ayesha if therewould be any objection to leo and myself walking round to inspect thehuman torches and as she had nothing to say against it we startedstriking round to the left</s>  after looking at one or two of the flamingbodies we were about to return thoroughly disgusted with the grotesqueweirdness of the spectacle when our attention was attracted by one ofthe dancers a particularly active leopard that had separated itselffrom its fellowbeasts and was whisking about in our immediateneighbourhood but gradually drawing into a spot where the shadowwas darkest equidistant between two of the flaming mummies</s>  drawn bycuriosity we followed it when suddenly it darted past us into theshadows beyond and as it did so erected itself and whispered comein a voice that we both recognised as that of ustane</s>  without waiting toconsult me leo turned and followed her into the outer darkness and ifeeling sick enough at heart went after them</s>  the leopard crawled onfor about fifty pacesa sufficient distance to be quite beyond thelight of the fire and torchesand then leo came up with it or ratherwith ustane</s> oh my lord i heard her whisper so i have found thee</s>  listen</s>  i amin

may escape</s> for heavens sake leo i began but she broke innay listen not to him</s>  swiftbe swiftdeath is in the air webreathe</s>  even now mayhap she heareth us and without more ado sheproceeded to back her arguments by throwing herself into his arms</s>  asshe did so the leopards head slipped from her hair and i saw the threewhite fingermarks upon it gleaming faintly in the starlight</s>  oncemore realising the desperate nature of the position i was about tointerpose for i knew that leo was not too strongminded where womenwere concerned whenoh</s>  horror</s> i heard a little silvery laugh behindme</s>  i turned round and there was she herself and with her billaliand two male mutes</s>  i gasped and nearly sank to the ground for i knewthat such a situation must result in some dreadful tragedy of which itseemed exceedingly probable to me that i should be the first victim</s>  asfor ustane she untwined her arms and covered her eyes with her handswhile leo not knowing the full terror of the position merely coveredup and looked as foolish as a man caught in such a trap would naturallydo</s> xxtriumphthen followed a moment of the most painful silence that i ever endured</s> it was broken by ayesha who addressed herself to leo</s> nay now my lord and guest she said in her softest tones which yethad the ring of steel about them look not so bashful</s>  surely the sightwas a pretty onethe leopard and the lion</s> oh hang it all</s>  said leo in english</s> and thou ustane she went on surely i should have passed thee byhad not the light fallen on the white

wretched woman slay me and let therebe an end</s> nay why</s>  it is not well to go so swift from the hot lips of love downto the cold mouth of the grave and she made a motion to the mutes whoinstantly stepped up and caught the girl by either arm</s>  with an oath leosprang upon the nearest and hurled him to the ground and then stoodover him with his face set and his fist ready</s> again ayesha laughed</s>  it was well thrown my guest thou hast a strongarm for one who so late was sick</s>  but now out of thy courtesy i praythee let that man live and do my bidding</s>  he shall not harm the girlthe night air grows chill and i would welcome her in mine own place</s> surely she whom thou dost favour shall be favoured of me also</s> i took leo by the arm and pulled him from the prostrate mute and hehalf bewildered obeyed the pressure</s>  then we all set out for the caveacross the plateau where a pile of white human ashes was all thatremained of the fire that had lit the dancing for the dancers hadvanished</s> in due course we gained ayeshas boudoirall too soon it seemed to mehaving a sad presage of what was to come lying heavy on my heart</s> ayesha seated herself upon her cushions and having dismissed job andbillali by signs bade the mutes tend the lamps and retireall saveone girl who was her favourite personal attendant</s>  we three remainedstanding the unfortunate ustane a little to the left of the rest of us</s> now oh holly ayesha began how came it that thou who didst hearmy words bidding this evildoerand she pointed to ustaneto gohencethou at

addressed ustane</s> hast thou aught to say woman</s>  thou silly straw thou feather whodidst think to float towards thy passions petty ends even against thegreat wind of my will</s>  tell me for i

voice rang like the cry of an inspired prophetess ah iseethen came an answering cry of mingled rage and terror</s>  i turned my head</s> ayesha had risen and was standing with her outstretched hand pointingat ustane who had suddenly stopped speaking</s>  i gazed at the poorwoman and as i gazed there came upon her face that same woeful fixedexpression of terror that i had seen once before when she had broken outinto her wild chant</s>  her eyes grew large her nostrils dilated and herlips blanched</s> ayesha said nothing she made no sound she only drew herself upstretched out her arm and her

fairkallikrates</s> i hate thee murderess and i have no wish to see thee</s>  what is it tome how fair thou art</s>  i hate thee i say</s> yet within a very little space shalt thou creep to my knee and swearthat thou dost love me answered ayesha with a sweet mocking laugh</s> come there is no time like the present time here before this deadgirl who loved thee let us put it to the proof</s> look now on me kallikrates</s>  and with a sudden motion she shook hergauzy covering from her and stood forth in her low kirtle and her snakyzone in her glorious radiant beauty and her imperial grace rising fromher wrappings as it were like venus from the wave or galatea from hermarble or a beatified spirit from the tomb</s>  she stood forth and fixedher deep and glowing eyes upon leos eyes and i saw his clenched fistsunclasp and his set and quivering features relax beneath her gaze</s> i saw his wonder and astonishment grow into admiration and then intofascination and the more he struggled the more i saw the power of herdread beauty fasten on him and take possession of his senses druggingthem and drawing the heart out of him</s>  did i not know the process</s>  hadnot i who was twice his age gone through it myself</s>  was i not goingthrough it afresh even then although her sweet and passionate gaze wasnot for me</s>  yes alas i was</s>  alas that i should have to confess thatat that very moment i was rent by mad and furious jealousy</s>  i couldhave flown at him shame upon me</s>  the woman had confounded and almostdestroyed my moral sense as she was bound to confound all

woman</s> a woman in truthin very truthand thine own spouse kallikrates</s> she answered stretching out her rounded ivory arms towards him andsmiling ah so sweetly</s> he looked and looked and slowly i perceived that he was drawing nearerto her</s>  suddenly his eye fell upon the corpse of poor ustane and heshuddered and stopped</s> how can i</s>  he said hoarsely</s>  thou art a murderess she loved me</s> observe he was already forgetting that he had loved her</s> it is naught she murmured and her voice sounded sweet as thenightwind passing through the trees</s>  it is naught at all</s>  if i havesinned let my beauty answer for my sin</s>  if i have sinned it is forlove of thee let my sin therefore be put away and forgotten andonce more she stretched out her arms and whispered come and then inanother few seconds it was all over</s> i saw him strugglei saw him even turn to fly but her eyes drewhim more strongly than iron bonds and the magic of her beauty andconcentrated will and passion entered into him and overpowered himayeven there in the presence of the body of the woman who had loved himwell enough to die for him</s>  it sounds horrible and wicked enough but heshould not be too greatly blamed and be sure his sin will find him out</s> the temptress who drew him into evil was more than human and her beautywas greater than the loveliness of the daughters of men</s> i looked up again and now her perfect form lay in his arms and her lipswere pressed against his own and thus with the corpse of his deadlove for an altar did leo vincey plight his troth to her redhandedmurderessplight it for ever and a day</s>  for those who sell themselvesinto a like dominion paying down the price of their own honour andthrowing their soul into the balance to sink the scale to the level oftheir lusts can hope for no deliverance here or hereafter</s>  as theyhave sown so shall they reap and reap even when the poppy flowers ofpassion have withered in their hands and their harvest is but bittertares garnered in satiety</s> suddenly with a snakelike motion she seemed to slip from his embraceand then again broke out into her low laugh of triumphant mockery</s> did i not tell thee that within a little space thou wouldst creep to myknee oh kallikrates</s>  and surely the space has not been a great one</s> leo groaned in shame and misery for though he was overcome andstricken down he was not so lost as to be unaware of the depth of thedegradation to which he had sunk</s>  on the contrary his better naturerose up in arms against his fallen self as i saw clearly enough lateron</s> ayesha laughed again and then quickly veiled herself and made a signto the girl mute who had been watching the whole scene with curiousstartled eyes</s>  the girl left and presently returned followed by twomale mutes to whom the queen made another sign</s>  thereon they all threeseized the body of poor ustane by the arms and dragged it heavily downthe cavern and away through the curtains at the end</s>  leo watched it fora little while and then covered his eyes with his hand and it too tomy excited fancy seemed to watch us as it went</s> there passes the dead past said ayesha solemnly as the curtainsshook and fell back into their places when the ghastly processionhad vanished behind them</s>  and then with one of those extraordinarytransitions of which i have already spoken she again threw off herveil and broke out after the ancient and poetic fashion of thedwellers in arabia into a pan of triumph or epithalamium whichwild and beautiful as it was is exceedingly difficult to render intoenglish and ought by rights to be sung to the music of a cantatarather than written and read</s>  it was divided into two partsonedescriptive or definitive and the other personal and as nearly as ican remember ran as followslove is like a flower in the desert</s> it is like the aloe of arabia that blooms but once and dies it bloomsin the salt emptiness of life and the brightness of its beauty is setupon the waste as a star is set upon a storm</s> it hath the sun above that is the spirit and above it blows the air ofits divinity</s> at the echoing of a step love blooms i say i say love blooms andbends her beauty down to him who passeth by</s> he plucketh it yea he plucketh the red cup that is full of honeyand beareth it away away across the desert away till the flower bewithered away till the desert be done</s> there is only one perfect flower in the wilderness of life</s> that flower is love</s> there is only one fixed star in the midsts of our wandering</s> that star is love</s> there is only one hope in our despairing night</s> that hope is love</s> all else is false</s>  all else is shadow moving upon water</s>  all else iswind and vanity</s> who shall say what is the weight or the measure of love</s> it is born of the flesh it dwelleth in the spirit</s>  from each doth itdraw its comfort</s> for beauty it is as a star</s> many are its shapes but all are beautiful and none know where the starrose or the horizon where it shall set</s>    among the ancient arabians the power of poetic  declamation either in verse or prose was held in the  highest honour and esteem and he who excelled in it was  known as khteb or orator</s>  every year a general assembly  was held at which the rival poets repeated their  compositions when those poems which were judged to be the  best were so soon as the knowledge and the art of writing  became general inscribed on silk in letters of gold and  publicly exhibited being known as al modhahabt or  golden verses</s>  in the poem given above by mr</s>  holly ayesha  evidently followed the traditional poetic manner of her  people which was to embody their thoughts in a series of  somewhat disconnected sentences each remarkable for its  beauty and the grace of its expression</s>  editor</s> then turning to leo and laying her hand upon his shoulder she wenton in a fuller and more triumphant tone speaking in balanced sentencesthat gradually grew and swelled from idealised prose into pure andmajestic verselong have i loved thee oh my love yet has my love not lessened</s> long have i waited for thee and behold my reward is at handis here</s> far away i saw thee once and thou wast taken from me</s> then in a grave sowed i the seed of patience and shone upon it with

sprung</s>  yea from among thedry bones and ashes of the dead</s> i have waited and my reward is with me</s> i have overcome death and death brought back to me him that was dead</s> therefore do i

mountain tops</s> soft shall we live my love and easy shall we go</s> crowned shall we be with the diadem of kings</s> worshipping and wonder struck all peoples of the world blinded shallfall before our beauty and might</s> from time unto times shall our greatness thunder on rolling like achariot through the dust of endless days</s> laughing shall we speed in our victory and pomp laughing like thedaylight as he leaps along the hills</s> onward still triumphant to a triumph ever new</s> onward in our power to a power unattained</s> onward never weary clad with splendour for a robe</s> till accomplished be our fate and the night is rushing down</s> she paused in her strange and most thrilling allegorical chant ofwhich i am unfortunately only able to give the burden and that feeblyenough and then saidperchance thou dost not believe my word kallikratesperchance thouthinkest that i do delude thee and that i have not lived these manyyears and that thou hast not been born again to me</s>  nay look notsoput away that pale cast of doubt for oh be sure herein can errorfind no foothold</s>  sooner shall the suns forget their course and theswallow miss her nest than my soul shall swear a lie and be led astrayfrom thee kallikrates</s>  blind me take away mine eyes and let thedarkness utterly fence me in and still mine ears would catch the toneof thy unforgotten voice striking more loud against the portals ofmy sense than can the call of brazenthroated clarionsstop up minehearing also and let a thousand touch me on the brow and i would namethee out of allyea rob me of every sense and see me stand deaf andblind and dumb and with nerves that cannot weigh the value of a touchyet would my spirit leap within me like a quickening child and cry untomy heart behold kallikrates</s>  behold thou watcher the watches ofthy night are ended</s>  behold thou who seekest in the night season thymorning star ariseth</s> she paused awhile and then continued but stay if thy heart is yethardened against the mighty truth and thou dost require a further pledgeof that which thou dost find too deep to understand even now shall itbe given to thee and to thee also oh my holly</s>  bear each one of you alamp and follow after me whither i shall lead you</s> without stopping to thinkindeed speaking for myself i had almostabandoned the function in circumstances under which to think seemedto be absolutely useless since thought fell hourly helpless against ablack wall of wonderwe took the lamps and followed her</s>  going to theend of her boudoir she raised a curtain and revealed a little stairof the sort that is so common in these dim caves of kr</s>  as we hurrieddown the stair i observed that the steps were worn in the centre tosuch an extent that some of them had been reduced from seven and a halfinches at which i guessed their original height to about three anda half</s>  now all the other steps that i had seen in the caves werepractically unworn as was to be expected seeing that the only trafficwhich ever passed upon them was that of those who bore a fresh burden tothe tomb</s>  therefore this fact struck my notice with that curious forcewith which little things do strike us when our minds are absolutelyoverwhelmed by a sudden rush of powerful sensations beaten flat as itwere like a sea beneath the first burst of a hurricane so that everylittle object on the surface starts into an unnatural prominence</s> at the bottom of the staircase i stood and stared at the worn steps andayesha turning saw me</s> wonderest thou whose are the feet that have worn away the rock myholly</s>  she asked</s>  they are mineeven mine own light feet</s>  i canremember when those stairs were fresh and level but for two thousandyears and more have i gone down hither day by day and see my sandalshave worn out the solid rock</s> i made no answer but i do not think that anything that i had heard orseen brought home to my limited understanding so clear a sense of thisbeings overwhelming antiquity as that hard rock hollowed out by hersoft white feet</s>  how many hundreds of thousands of times must she havepassed up and down that stair to bring about such a result</s> the stair led to a tunnel and a few paces down the tunnel was one ofthe usual curtainhung doorways a glance at which told me that itwas the same where i had been a witness of that terrible scene by theleaping flame</s>  i recognised the pattern of the curtain and the sight ofit brought the whole event vividly before my eyes and made me trembleeven at its memory</s>  ayesha entered the tomb for it was a tomb and wefollowed heri for one rejoicing that the mystery of the place wasabout to be cleared up and yet afraid to face its solution</s> xxithe dead and living meetsee now the place where i have slept for these two thousand yearssaid ayesha taking the lamp from leos hand and holding it above herhead</s>  its rays fell upon a little hollow in the floor where i had seenthe leaping flame but the fire was out now</s>  they fell upon the whiteform stretched there beneath its wrappings upon its bed of stoneupon the fretted carving of the tomb and upon another shelf of stoneopposite the one on which the body lay and separated from it by thebreadth of the cave</s> here went on ayesha laying her hand upon the rockhere have islept night by night for all these generations with but a cloak tocover me</s>  it did not become me that i should lie soft when my spouseyonder and she pointed to the rigid form lay stiff in death</s>  herenight by night have i slept in his cold companytill thou seest thisthick slab like the stairs down which we passed has worn thin with thetossing of my formso faithful have i been to thee even in thy spaceof sleep kallikrates</s>  and now mine own thou shalt see a wonderfulthingliving thou shalt behold thyself deadfor well have i tendedthee during all these years kallikrates</s>  art thou prepared</s> we made no answer but gazed at each other with frightened eyes thewhole scene was so dreadful and so solemn</s>  ayesha advanced and laid herhand upon the corner of the shroud and once more spoke</s> be not affrighted she said though the thing seem wonderful totheeall we who live have thus lived before nor is the very shapethat holds us a stranger to the sun</s>  only we know it not because memorywrites no record and earth hath gathered in the earth she lent us fornone have saved our glory from the grave</s>  but i by my arts and by thearts of those dead men of kr which i have learned have held theeback oh kallikrates from the dust that the waxen stamp of beautyon thy face should ever rest before mine eye</s>  twas a mask that memorymight fill serving to fashion out thy presence from the past andgive it strength to wander in the habitations of my thought clad in amummery of life that stayed my appetite with visions of dead days</s> behold now let the dead and living meet</s>  across the gulf of time theystill are one</s>  time hath no power against identity though sleep themerciful hath blotted out the tablets of our mind and with oblivionsealed the sorrows that else would hound us from life to life stuffingthe brain with gathered griefs till it burst in the madness of uttermostdespair</s>  still are they one for the wrappings of our sleep shall rollaway as thunderclouds before the wind the frozen voice of the pastshall melt in music like mountain snows beneath the sun and the weepingand the laughter of the lost hours shall be heard once more most sweetlyechoing up the cliffs of immeasurable time</s> ay the sleep shall roll away and the voices shall be heard when downthe completed chain whereof our each existence is a link the lightningof the spirit hath passed to work out the purpose of our beingquickening and fusing those separated days of life and shaping them toa staff whereon we may safely lean as we wend to our appointed fate</s> therefore have no fear kallikrates when thouliving and but latelybornshalt look upon thine own departed self who breathed and diedso long ago</s>  i do but turn one page in thy book of being and show theewhat is writ thereon</s> behold</s> with a sudden motion she drew the shroud from the cold form and let thelamplight play upon it</s>  i looked and then shrank back terrified sincesay what she might in explanation the sight was an uncanny onefor herexplanations were beyond the grasp of our finite minds and when theywere stripped from the mists of vague esoteric philosophy and broughtinto conflict with the cold and horrifying fact did not do much tobreak its force</s>  for there stretched upon the stone bier before usrobed in white and perfectly preserved was what appeared to be the bodyof leo vincey</s>  i stared from leo standing there alive to leo lyingthere dead and could see no difference except perhaps that thebody on the bier looked older</s>  feature for feature they were the sameeven down to the crop of little golden curls which was leos mostuncommon beauty</s>  it even seemed to me as i looked that the expressionon the dead mans face resembled that which i had sometimes seen uponleos when he was plunged into profound sleep</s>  i can only sum up thecloseness of the resemblance by saying that i never saw twins so exactlysimilar as that dead and living pair</s> i turned to see what effect was produced upon leo by the sight of hisdead self and found it to be one of partial stupefaction</s>  he stoodfor two or three minutes staring and said nothing and when at last hespoke it was only to ejaculatecover it up and take me away</s> nay wait kallikrates said ayesha who standing with the lampraised above her head flooding with its light her own rich beauty andthe cold wonder of the deathclothed form upon the bier resembledan inspired sibyl rather than a woman as she rolled out her majesticsentences with a grandeur and a freedom of utterance which i am alas</s> quite unable to reproduce</s> wait i would show thee something that no tittle of my crime may behidden from thee</s>  do thou oh holly open the garment on the breastof the dead kallikrates for perchance my lord may fear to touch ithimself</s> i obeyed with trembling hands</s>  it seemed a desecration and an unhallowedthing to touch that sleeping image of the live man by my side</s>  presentlyhis broad chest was bare and there upon it right over the heart was awound evidently inflicted with a spear</s> thou seest kallikrates she said</s>  know then that it was i who slewthee in the place of life i gave thee death</s>  i slew thee because ofthe egyptian amenartas whom thou didst love for by her wiles she heldthy heart and her i could not smite as but now i smote that woman forshe was too strong for me</s>  in my haste and bitter anger i slew thee andnow for all these days have i lamented thee and waited for thy coming</s> and thou hast come and none can stand between thee and me and of atruth now for death i will give thee lifenot life eternal for thatnone can give but life and youth that shall endure for thousands uponthousands of years and with it pomp and power and wealth and allthings that are good and beautiful such as have been to no man beforethee nor shall be to any man who comes after</s>  and now one thing moreand thou shalt rest and make ready for the day of thy new birth</s>  thouseest this body which was thine own</s>  for all these centuries it hathbeen my cold comfort and my companion but now i need it no more fori have thy living presence and it can but serve to stir up memoriesof that which i would fain forget</s>  let it therefore go back to the dustfrom which i held it</s> behold</s>  i have prepared against this happy hour</s>  and going to theother shelf or stone ledge which she said had served her for a bed shetook from it a large vitrified doublehanded vase the mouth of whichwas tied up with a bladder</s>  this she loosed and then having bent downand gently kissed the white forehead of the dead man she undid thevase and sprinkled its contents carefully over the form taking iobserved the greatest precautions against any drop of them touchingus or herself and then poured out what remained of the liquid upon thechest and head</s>  instantly a dense vapour arose and the cave was filledwith choking fumes that prevented us from seeing anything while thedeadly acid for i presume it was some tremendous preparation of thatsort did its work</s>  from the spot where the body lay came a fiercefizzing and cracking sound which ceased however before the fumes hadcleared away</s>  at last they were all gone except a little cloud thatstill hung over the corpse</s>  in a couple of minutes more this too hadvanished and wonderful as it may seem it is a fact that on the stonebench that had supported the mortal remains of the ancient kallikratesfor so many centuries there was now nothing to be seen but a fewhandfuls of smoking white powder</s>  the acid had utterly destroyed thebody and even in places eaten into the stone</s>  ayesha stooped down andtaking a handful of this powder in her grasp threw it into the airsaying at the same time in a voice of calm solemnitydust to dust</s> the past to the past</s> the dead to thedead</s> kallikrates is dead and is born again</s> the ashes floated noiselessly to the rocky floor and we stood in awedsilence and watched them fall too overcome for words</s>
now leave me she said and sleep if ye may</s>  i must watch and thinkfor tomorrow night we go hence and the time is long since i trod thepath that we must follow</s> accordingly we bowed and left her</s> as we passed to our own apartment i peeped into jobs sleeping placeto see how he fared for he had gone away just before our interview withthe murdered ustane quite prostrated by the terrors of the amahaggerfestivity</s>  he was sleeping soundly good honest fellow that he wasand i rejoiced to think that his nerves which like those of mostuneducated people were far from strong had been spared the closingscenes of this dreadful day</s>  then we entered our own chamber and hereat last poor leo who ever since he had looked upon that frozenimage of his living self had been in a state not far removed fromstupefaction burst out into a torrent of grief</s>  now that he was nolonger in the presence of the dread she his sense of the awfulnessof all that had happened and more especially of the wicked murder ofustane who was bound to him by ties so close broke upon him like astorm and lashed him into an agony of remorse and terror which waspainful to witness</s>  he cursed himselfhe cursed the hour when we hadfirst seen the writing on the sherd which was being so mysteriouslyverified and bitterly he cursed his own weakness</s>  ayesha he dared notcursewho dared speak evil of such a woman whose consciousness foraught we knew was watching us at the very moment</s> what am i to do old fellow</s>  he groaned resting his head against myshoulder in the extremity of his grief</s>  i let her be killednot thati could help that but within five minutes i was kissing her murderessover her body</s>  i am a degraded brute but i cannot resist that andhere his voice sankthat awful sorceress</s>  i know i shall do it againtomorrow i know that i am in her power for always if i never saw heragain i should never think of anybody else during all my life i mustfollow her as a needle follows a magnet i would not go away now if icould i could not leave her my legs would not carry me but my mind isstill clear enough and in my mind i hate herat least i think so</s>  itis all so horrible and thatthat body</s>  what can i make of it</s>  it wasi</s>  i am sold into bondage old fellow and she will take my soul asthe price of herself</s> then for the first time i told him that i was in a but very littlebetter position and i am bound to say that notwithstanding his owninfatuation he had the decency to sympathise with me</s>  perhaps he didnot think it worth while being jealous realising that he had no causeso far as the lady was concerned</s>  i went on to suggest that we shouldtry to run away but we soon rejected the project as futile and to beperfectly honest i do not believe that either of us would really haveleft ayesha even if some superior power had suddenly offered to conveyus from these gloomy caves and set us down in cambridge</s>  we could nomore have left her than a moth can leave the light that destroys it</s>  wewere like confirmed opiumeaters in our moments of reason we well knewthe deadly nature of our pursuit but we certainly were not prepared toabandon its terrible delights</s> no man who once had seen she unveiled and heard the music of hervoice and drunk in the bitter wisdom of her words would willingly giveup the sight for a whole sea of placid joys</s>  how much more then wasthis likely to be so when as in leos case to put myself out of thequestion this extraordinary creature declared her utter and absolutedevotion and gave what appeared to be proofs of its having lasted forsome two thousand years</s> no doubt she was a wicked person and no doubt she had murdered ustanewhen she stood in her path but then she was very faithful and by alaw of nature man is apt to think but lightly of a womans crimesespecially if that woman be beautiful and the crime be committed forthe love of him</s> and then for the rest when had such a chance ever come to a man beforeas that which now lay in leos hand</s>  true in uniting himself to thisdread woman he would place his life under the influence of a mysteriouscreature of evil tendencies but then that would be likely enough tohappen to him in any ordinary marriage</s>  on the other hand however noordinary marriage could bring him such awful beautyfor awful is theonly word that can describe itsuch divine devotion such wisdom andcommand over the secrets of nature and the place and power that theymust win or lastly the royal crown of unending youth if indeed shecould give that</s>  no on the whole it is not wonderful that though leowas plunged in bitter shame and grief such as any gentleman would havefelt under the circumstances he was not ready to entertain the idea ofrunning away from his extraordinary fortune</s>    after some months of consideration of this statement i  am bound to confess that i am not quite satisfied of its  truth</s>  it is perfectly true that ayesha committed a murder  but i shrewdly suspect that were we endowed with the same  absolute power and if we had the same tremendous interest  at stake we would be very apt to do likewise under parallel  circumstances</s>  also it must be remembered that she looked  on it as an execution for disobedience under a system which  made the slightest disobedience punishable by death</s>  putting  aside this question of the murder her evildoing resolves  itself into the expression of views and the acknowledgment  of motives which are contrary to our preaching if not to our  practice</s>  now at first sight this might be fairly taken as a  proof of an evil nature but when we come to consider the  great antiquity of the individual it becomes doubtful if it  was anything more than the natural cynicism which arises  from age and bitter experience and the possession of  extraordinary powers of observation</s>  it is a well known fact  that very often putting the period of boyhood out of the  question the older we grow the more cynical and hardened we  get indeed many of us are only saved by timely death from  utter moral petrifaction if not moral corruption</s>  no one  will deny that a young man is on the average better than an  old one for he is without that experience of the order of  things that in certain thoughtful dispositions can hardly  fail to produce cynicism and that disregard of acknowledged  methods and established custom which we call evil</s>  now the  oldest man upon the earth was but a babe compared to ayesha  and the wisest man upon the earth was not onethird as wise</s>   and the fruit of her wisdom was this that there was but one  thing worth living for and that was love in its highest  sense and to gain that good thing she was not prepared to  stop at trifles</s>  this is really the sum of her evil doings  and it must be remembered on the other hand that whatever  may be thought of them she had some virtues developed to a  degree very uncommon in either sexconstancy for  instance</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> my own opinion is that he would have been mad if he had done so</s>  butthen i confess that my statement on the matter must be accepted withqualifications</s>  i am in love with ayesha myself to this day and i wouldrather have been the object of her affection for one short week thanthat of any other woman in the world for a whole lifetime</s>  and let meadd that if anybody who doubts this statement and thinks me foolishfor making it could have seen ayesha draw her veil and flash out inbeauty on his gaze his view would exactly coincide with my own</s>  ofcourse i am speaking of any man</s>  we never had the advantage of aladys opinion of ayesha but i think it quite possible that shewould have regarded the queen with dislike would have expressed herdisapproval in some more or less pointed manner and ultimately have gotherself blasted</s> for two hours or more leo and i sat with shaken nerves and frightenedeyes and talked over the miraculous events through which we werepassing</s>  it seemed like a dream or a fairy tale instead of the solemnsober fact</s>  who would have believed that the writing on the potsherd wasnot only true but that we should live to verify its truth and thatwe two seekers should find her who was sought patiently awaiting ourcoming in the tombs of kr</s>  who would have thought that in the personof leo this mysterious woman should as she believed discover thebeing whom she awaited from century to century and whose former earthlyhabitation she had till this very night preserved</s>  but so it was</s>  in theface of all we had seen it was difficult for us as ordinary reasoningmen any longer to doubt its truth and therefore at last with humblehearts and a deep sense of the impotence of human knowledge and theinsolence of its assumption that denies that to be possible which it hasno experience of we laid ourselves down to sleep leaving our fates inthe hands of that watching providence which had thus chosen to allow usto draw the veil of human ignorance and reveal to us for good or evilsome glimpse of the possibilities of life</s> xxiijob has a presentimentit was

the time comes just to help one throughas it were</s>  and now sir ill be getting the breakfast and he wentleaving me in a very uncomfortable state of mind</s>  i was deeply attachedto old job who was one of the best and honestest men i have ever hadto do with in any class of life and really more of a friend than aservant and the mere idea of anything happening to him brought a lumpinto my throat</s>  beneath all his ludicrous talk i could see that hehimself was quite convinced that something was going to happenand though in most cases these convictions turn out to be uttermoonshineand this particular one especially was to be amply accountedfor by the gloomy and unaccustomed surroundings in which its victimwas placedstill it did more or less carry a chill to my heart as anydread

the grainfrom which they make their beer</s>  this they did in scriptural fashionaman with a bag made of goats hide fastened round his waist walking upand down the plot and scattering the seed as he went</s>  it was a positiverelief to see one of these dreadful people do anything so homely andpleasant as sow a field perhaps because it seemed to link them as itwere with the rest of humanity</s> as we were returning billali met us and informed us that it was shespleasure that we should wait upon her and accordingly we entered herpresence not without trepidation for ayesha was certainly an exceptionto the rule</s>  familiarity with her might and did breed passion and wonderand horror but it certainly did not breed contempt</s> we were as usual shown in by the mutes and after these hadretired ayesha unveiled and once more bade leo embrace her whichnotwithstanding his heartsearchings of the previous night he did withmore alacrity and fervour than in strictness courtesy

that i had no wish to prolong an existence which must always behaunted and tortured by her memory and by the last bitterness ofunsatisfied love</s>  but so it was and so alas is it to this hour</s> and now went on she changing her tone and the subject togethertell me my kallikrates for as yet i know it not how came ye to seekme here</s>  yesternight thou didst say that kallikrateshim whom thousawestwas thine ancestor</s>  how was it</s>  tell methou dost not speakovermuch</s> thus adjured leo told her the wonderful story of the casket and of thepotsherd that written on by his

evil ohhollyit was when my beloved lay so illthat out of good came eviland out of evil goodthat they who sowed knew not what the cropshould be nor he who struck where the blow should fall</s>  see now thisegyptian amenartas this royal child of the nile who hated me and whomeven now i hate for in a way she did prevail against mesee now sheherself hath been the very means to bring her lover to mine

slew his father</s>  and thou my kallikrates artthe father and in a sense thou art likewise the son and wouldst thouavenge thy wrong and the wrong of that faroff mother of thine uponme oh kallikrates</s>  see and she slid to her knees and drew the whitecorsage still farther down her ivory bosomsee here beats my heartand there by thy side is a knife heavy and long and sharp the

not even for the sake of her whom thou slewest but lastnight</s>  i am in thy power and a very slave to thee</s>  how can i killthee</s> sooner should i slay myself</s> almost dost thou begin to love

not that thou shouldst dwell in these caves of kr</s> nay when once thou art even as i am we will go hencefear not butthat i shall find a pathand then shall we journey to this england ofthine and live as it becometh us to live</s>  two thousand years have iwaited for the day when i should see the last of these hateful caves andthis gloomyvisaged folk and now it is at hand and my heart bounds upto meet it like a childs towards its holiday</s>  for thou shalt rule thisenglandbut we have a queen already broke in leo hastily</s> it is naught it is naught said ayesha she can be overthrown</s> at this we both broke out into an exclamation of dismay and explainedthat we should as soon think of overthrowing ourselves</s> but here is a strange thing said ayesha in astonishment a queenwhom her people love</s>  surely the world must have changed since i dweltin kr</s> again we explained that it was the character of monarchs that hadchanged and that the one under whom we lived was venerated and belovedby all rightthinking people in her vast realms</s>  also we told her thatreal power in our country rested in the hands of the people and that wewere in fact ruled by the votes of the lower and least educated classesof the community</s> ah she said a democracythen surely there is a tyrant for i havelong since seen that democracies having no clear will of their own inthe end set up a tyrant and worship him</s> yes i said we have our tyrants</s> well she answered resignedly we can at any rate destroy thesetyrants and kallikrates shall rule the land</s> i instantly informed ayesha that in england blasting was not anamusement that could be indulged in with impunity and that any suchattempt would meet with the consideration of the law and probably endupon a scaffold</s> the law she laughed with scornthe law</s>  canst thou not understandoh holly that i am above the law and so shall my kallikrates be also</s> all human law will be to us as the north wind to a mountain</s>  does thewind bend the mountain or the mountain the wind</s> and now leave me i pray thee and thou too my own kallikrates fori would get me ready against our journey and so must ye both and yourservant

thesesepulchres of kr</s>  yea surely thou mayst kiss my hand</s> so we went i for one meditating deeply on the awful nature of theproblem that now opened out before us</s>  the terrible she had evidentlymade up her mind to go to england and it made me absolutely shudderto think what would be the result of her arrival there</s>  what her powerswere i knew and i could not doubt but that she would exercise themto the full</s>  it might be possible to control her for a while but herproud ambitious spirit would be certain to break loose and avengeitself for the long centuries of its solitude</s>  she would if necessaryand if the power of her beauty did not unaided prove equal to theoccasion blast her way to any end she set before her and as she couldnot die and for aught i knew could not even be killed what wasthere to stop her</s>  in the end she would i had little doubt assumeabsolute rule over the british dominions and probably over the wholeearth and though i was sure that she would speedily make ours the mostglorious and prosperous empire that the world has ever seen it would beat the cost of a terrible sacrifice of life</s>    i regret to say that i was never able to ascertain if  she was invulnerable against the ordinary accidents of  life</s>  presumably this was so else some misadventure would  have been sure to put an end to her in the course of so many  centuries</s>  true she offered to let leo slay her but very  probably this was only an experiment to try his temper and  mental attitude towards her</s>  ayesha never gave way to  impulse without some valid object</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> the whole thing sounded like a dream or some extraordinary invention ofa speculative brain and yet it was a facta wonderful factof whichthe whole world would soon be called on to take notice</s>  what was themeaning of it all</s>  after much thinking i could only conclude that thismarvellous creature whose passion had kept her for so many centurieschained as it were and comparatively harmless was now about to be usedby providence as a means to change the order of the world and possiblyby the building up of a power that could no more be rebelled againstor questioned than the decrees of fate to change it materially for thebetter</s> xxiiithe temple of truthour preparations did not take us very long</s>  we put a change of clothingapiece and some spare boots into my gladstone bag also we took ourrevolvers and an express rifle each together with a good supply ofammunition a precaution to which under providence we subsequentlyowed our lives over and over again</s>  the rest of our gear together withour heavy rifles we left behind us</s> a few minutes before the appointed time we once more attended inayeshas boudoir and found her also ready her dark cloak thrown overher windingsheetlike wrappings</s> are ye prepared for the great venture</s>  she said</s> we are i answered though for my part ayesha i have no faith init</s> ah my holly she said thou art of a truth like those old jewsofwhom the memory vexes me so sorelyunbelieving and hard to acceptthat which they have not known</s>
 but thou shalt see for unless my mirrorbeyond lies and she pointed to the font of crystal water the path isyet open as it was of old time</s>  and now let us start upon the new lifewhich shall endwho knoweth where</s> ah i echoed who knoweth where</s>  and we passed down into the greatcentral cave and out into the light of day</s>  at the mouth of the cave wefound a single litter with six bearers all of them mutes waiting andwith them i was relieved to see our old friend billali for whom ihad conceived a sort of affection</s>  it appeared that for reasons notnecessary to explain at length ayesha had thought it best that withthe exception of herself we should proceed on foot and this we werenothing loth to do after our long confinement in these caveswhich however suitable they might be for sarcophagia singularlyinappropriate word by the way for these particular tombs whichcertainly did not consume the bodies given to their keepingweredepressing habitations for breathing mortals like ourselves</s>  either byaccident or by the orders of she the space in front of the cave wherewe had beheld that awful dance was perfectly clear of spectators</s>  nota soul was to be seen and consequently i do not believe that ourdeparture was known to anybody except perhaps the mutes who waited onshe and they were of course in the habit of keeping what they sawto themselves</s> in a few minutes time we were stepping out sharply across the greatcultivated plain or lake bed framed like a vast emerald in its settingof frowning cliff and had another opportunity of wondering at theextraordinary nature of the site chosen by these old people of kr fortheir capital and at the marvellous amount of labour ingenuity andengineering skill that must have been brought into requisition by thefounders of the city to drain so huge a sheet of water and to keepit clear of subsequent accumulations</s>  it is indeed so far as myexperience goes an unequalled instance of what man can do in the faceof nature for in my opinion such achievements as the suez canal oreven the mont cenis tunnel do not approach this ancient undertaking inmagnitude and grandeur of conception</s> when we had been walking for about half an hour enjoying ourselvesexceedingly in the delightful cool which about this time of the dayalways appeared to descend upon the great plain of kr and which insome degree atoned for the want of any land or sea breezefor all windwas kept off by the rocky mountain wallwe began to get a clear view ofwhat billali had informed us were the ruins of the great city</s>  and evenfrom that distance we could see how wonderful those ruins were a factwhich with every step we took became more evident</s>  the town was notvery large if compared to babylon or thebes or other cities of remoteantiquity perhaps its outer wall contained some twelve square miles ofground or a little more</s>  nor had the walls so far as we could judgewhen we reached them been very high probably not more than forty feetwhich was about their present height where they had not through thesinking of the ground or some such cause fallen into ruin</s>  the reasonof this no doubt was that the people of kr being protected from anyoutside attack by far more tremendous ramparts than any that the hand ofman could rear only required them for show and to guard against civildiscord</s>  but on the other hand they were as broad as they were highbuilt entirely of dressed stone hewn no doubt from the vast cavesand surrounded by a great moat about sixty feet in width some reachesof which were still filled with water</s>  about ten minutes before thesun finally sank we reached this moat and passed down and through itclambering across what evidently were the piledup fragments of a greatbridge in order to do so and then with some little difficulty over theslope of the wall to its summit</s>  i wish that it lay within the power ofmy pen to give some idea of the grandeur of the sight that then met ourview</s>  there all bathed in the red glow of the sinking sun were milesupon miles of ruinscolumns temples shrines and the palaces ofkings varied with patches of green bush</s>  of course the roofs of thesebuildings had long since fallen into decay and vanished but owing tothe extreme massiveness of the style of building and to the hardnessand durability of the rock employed most of the party walls and greatcolumns still remained standing</s>    in connection with the extraordinary state of  preservation of these ruins after so vast a lapse of time  at least six thousand yearsit must be remembered that kr  was not burnt or destroyed by an enemy or an earthquake but  deserted owing to the action of a terrible plague</s>   consequently the houses were left unharmed also the climate  of the plain is remarkably fine and dry and there is very  little rain or wind as a result of which these relics have  only to contend against the unaided action of time that  works but slowly upon such massive blocks of masonry</s>  l</s>   h</s>  h</s> straight before us stretched away what had evidently been the mainthoroughfare of the city for it was very wide wider than the thamesembankment and regular being as we afterwards discovered pavedor rather built throughout of blocks of dressed stone such as wereemployed in the walls it was but little overgrown even now with grassand shrubs that could get no depth of soil to live in</s>  what had been theparks and gardens on the contrary were now dense jungle</s>  indeed itwas easy even from a distance to trace the course of the various roadsby the burntup appearance of the scanty grass that grew upon them</s>  oneither side of this great thoroughfare were vast blocks of ruins eachblock generally speaking being separated from its neighbour by a spaceof what had once i suppose been gardenground but was now dense andtangled bush</s>  they were all built of the same coloured stone and mostof them had pillars which was as much as we could make out in thefading light as we passed swiftly up the main road that i believe i amright in saying no living foot had pressed for thousands of years</s>    billali told me that the amahagger believe that the site  of the city is haunted and could not be persuaded to enter  it upon any consideration</s>  indeed i could see that he  himself did not at all like doing so and was only consoled  by the reflection that he was under the direct protection of  she</s>  it struck leo and myself as very curious that a  people which has no objection to living amongst the dead  with whom their familiarity has perhaps bred contempt and  even using their bodies for purposes of fuel should be  terrified at approaching the habitations that these very  departed had occupied when alive</s>  after all however it is  only a savage inconsistency</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> presently we came to an enormous pile which we rightly took to be atemple covering at least eight acres of ground and apparently arrangedin a series of courts each one enclosing another of smaller size onthe principle of a chinese nest of boxes the courts being separated onefrom the other by rows of huge columns</s>  and while i think of it i mayas well state a remarkable thing about the shape of these columns whichresembled none that i have ever seen or heard of being fashioned with akind of waist at the centre and swelling out above and below</s>  at firstwe thought that this shape was meant to roughly symbolise or suggestthe female form as was a common habit amongst the ancient religiousarchitects of many creeds</s>  on the following day however as we went upthe slopes of the mountain we discovered a large quantity of the moststately looking palms of which the trucks grew exactly in this shapeand i have now no doubt but that the first designer of those columnsdrew his inspiration from the graceful bends of those very palms orrather of their ancestors which then some eight or ten thousand yearsago as now beautified the slopes of the mountain that had once formedthe shores of the volcanic lake</s> at the faade of this huge temple which i should imagine is almostas large as that of elkarnac at thebes some of the largest columnswhich i measured being between eighteen to twenty feet in diameter atthe base by about seventy feet in height our little procession washalted and ayesha descended from her litter</s> there was a spot here kallikrates she said to leo who had run up tohelp her down where one might sleep</s>  two thousand years ago did thouand i and that egyptian asp rest therein but since then have i not setfoot here nor any man and perchance it has fallen and followed bythe rest of us she passed up a vast flight of broken and ruined stepsinto the outer court and looked round into the gloom</s>  presently sheseemed to recollect and walking a few paces along the wall to theleft halted</s>
it is here she said and at the same time beckoned to the two muteswho were loaded with provisions and our little belongings to advance</s> one of them came forward and producing a lamp lit it from his brazierfor the amahagger when on a journey nearly always carried with them alittle lighted brazier from which to provide fire</s>  the tinder of thisbrazier was made of broken fragments of mummy carefully damped andif the admixture of moisture was properly managed this unholy compoundwould smoulder away for hours</s>  as soon as the lamp was lit we enteredthe place before which ayesha had halted</s>  it turned out to be a chamberhollowed in the thickness of the wall and from the fact of there stillbeing a massive stone table in it i should think that it had probablyserved as a livingroom perhaps for one of the doorkeepers of thegreat temple</s>    after all we are not much in advance of the amahagger in  these matters</s>  mummy that is pounded ancient egyptian  is i believe a pigment much used by artists and  especially by those of them who direct their talents to the  reproduction of the works of the old masters</s> editor</s> here we stopped and after cleaning the place out and making it ascomfortable as circumstances and the darkness would permit we ate somecold meat at least leo job and i did for ayesha as i think i havesaid elsewhere never touched anything except cakes of flour fruit andwater</s>  while we were still eating the moon which was at her full roseabove the mountainwall and began to flood the place with silver</s> wot ye why i have brought you here tonight my holly</s>  said ayeshaleaning her head upon her hand and watching the great orb as she roselike some heavenly queen above the solemn pillars of the temple</s>  ibrought younay it is strange but knowest thou kallikrates thatthou liest at this moment upon the very spot where thy dead body laywhen i bore thee back to those caves of kr so many years ago</s>  it allreturns to my mind now</s>  i can see it and horrible is it to my sight</s> and she shuddered</s> here leo jumped up and hastily changed his seat</s>  however thereminiscence might affect ayesha it clearly had few charms for him</s> i brought you went on ayesha presently that ye might look uponthe most wonderful sight that ever the eye of man beheldthe full moonshining over ruined kr</s>  when ye have done your eatingi would that icould teach you to eat naught but fruit kallikrates but that will comeafter thou hast laved in the fire</s>  once i too ate flesh like a brutebeast</s>  when ye have done we will go out and i will show you this greattemple and the god whom men once worshipped therein</s> of course we got up at once and started</s>  and here again my pen failsme</s>  to give a string of measurements and details of the various courtsof the temple would only be wearisome supposing that i had them andyet i know not how i am to describe what we saw magnificent as it waseven in its ruin almost beyond the power of realisation</s>  court upon dimcourt row upon row of mighty pillarssome of them especially at thegateways sculptured from pedestal to capitalspace upon space of emptychambers that spoke more eloquently to the imagination than any crowdedstreets</s>  and over all the dead silence of the dead the sense of utterloneliness and the brooding spirit of the past</s>  how beautiful it wasand yet how drear</s>  we did not dare to speak aloud</s>  ayesha herself wasawed in the presence of an antiquity compared to which even her lengthof days was but a little thing we only whispered and our whispersseemed to run from column to column till they were lost in the quietair</s>  bright fell the moonlight on pillar and court and shattered wallhiding all their rents and imperfections in its silver garment andclothing their hoar majesty with the peculiar glory of the night</s>  it wasa wonderful sight to see the full moon looking down on the ruined faneof kr</s>  it was a wonderful thing to think for how many thousands ofyears the dead orb above and the dead city below had gazed thus uponeach other and in the utter solitude of space poured forth each to eachthe tale of their lost life and longdeparted glory</s>  the whitelight fell and minute by minute the quiet shadows crept acrossthe grassgrown courts like the spirits of old priests haunting thehabitations of their worshipthe white light fell and the long shadowsgrew till the beauty and grandeur of each scene and the untamed majestyof its present death seemed to sink into our very souls and speak moreloudly than the shouts of armies concerning the pomp and splendour thatthe grave had swallowed and even memory had forgotten</s> come said ayesha after we had gazed and gazed i know not for howlong and i will show you the stony flower of loveliness and wondersvery crown if yet it stands to mock time with its beauty and fillthe heart of man with longing for that which is behind the veil andwithout waiting for an answer she led us through two more pillaredcourts into the inner shrine of the old fane</s> and there in the centre of the inmost court that might have been somefifty yards square or a little more we stood face to face with whatis perhaps the grandest allegorical work of art that the genius of herchildren has ever given to the world</s>  for in the exact centre of thecourt placed upon a thick square slab of rock was a huge round ball ofdark stone some twenty feet in diameter and standing on the ball was acolossal winged figure of a beauty so entrancing and divine that wheni first gazed upon it illuminated and shadowed as it was by the softlight of the moon my breath stood still and for an instant my heartceased its beating</s> the statue was hewn from marble so pure and white that even now afterall those ages it shone as the moonbeams danced upon it and its heightwas i should say a trifle over twenty feet</s>  it was the winged figureof a woman of such marvellous loveliness and delicacy of form that thesize seemed rather to add to than to detract from its so human and yetmore spiritual beauty</s>  she was bending forward and poising herself uponher halfspread wings as though to preserve her balance as she leant</s> her arms were outstretched like those of some woman about to embraceone she dearly loved while her whole attitude gave an impression ofthe tenderest beseeching</s>  her perfect and most gracious form was nakedsaveand here came the extraordinary thingthe face which was thinlyveiled so that we could only trace the marking of her features</s>  a gauzyveil was thrown round and about the head and of its two ends one felldown across her left breast which was outlined beneath it and one nowbroken streamed away upon the air behind her</s> who is she</s>  i asked as soon as i could take my eyes off the statue</s> canst thou not guess oh holly</s>  answered ayesha</s>  where then is thyimagination</s>  it is truth standing on the world and calling to itschildren to unveil her face</s>  see what is writ upon the pedestal</s>  withoutdoubt it is taken from the book of scriptures of these men of kr andshe led the way to the foot of the statue where an inscription of theusual chineselooking hieroglyphics was so deeply graven as to be stillquite legible at least to ayesha</s>  according to her translation it ranthusis there no man that will draw my veil and look upon my face for it isvery fair</s>  unto him who draws my veil shall i be and peace will i givehim and sweet children of knowledge and good works</s> and a voice cried though all those who seek after thee desire theebehold</s>  virgin art thou and virgin shalt thou go till time be done</s>  noman is there born of woman who may draw thy veil and live

they</s> and so i added sadly do men seek to this very hour but they findout and as this scripture saith nor shall they for in death only istruth found</s> then with one more look at this veiled and spiritualisedlovelinesswhich was so perfect and so pure that one might almost fancythat the light of a living spirit shone through the marble prison tolead man on to high and ethereal thoughtsthis poets dream of beautyfrozen into stone which i shall never forget while i live we turnedand went back through the vast moonlit courts to the spot whence we hadstarted</s>  i never saw the statue again which i the more regret becauseon the great ball of stone representing the world whereon the figurestood lines were drawn that probably had there been light enough weshould have discovered to be a map of the universe as it was known tothe people of kr</s>  it is at any rate suggestive of some scientificknowledge that these longdead worshippers of truth had recognised thefact that the globe is round</s> xxivwalking the planknext day the mutes woke us before the dawn and by the time that we hadgot the sleep out of our eyes and gone through a perfunctory wash at aspring which still welled up into the remains of a marble basin in thecentre of the north quadrangle of the vast outer court we found shestanding by the litter ready to start while old billali and the twobearer mutes were busy collecting the baggage</s>  as usual ayesha wasveiled like the marble truth by the way i wonder if she originallygot the idea of covering up her beauty from that statue</s> </s>  i noticedhowever that she seemed very depressed and had none of that proud andbuoyant bearing which would have betrayed her among a thousand women ofthe same stature even if they had been veiled like herself</s>  she lookedup as we camefor her head was bowedand greeted us</s>  leo asked her howshe had slept</s> ill my kallikrates she answered ill</s>  this night have strange andhideous dreams come creeping through my brain and i know not what theymay portend</s>  almost do i feel as though some evil overshadowed me andyet how can evil touch me</s>  i wonder she went on with a sudden outbreakof womanly tenderness i wonder if should aught happen to me so thati slept awhile and left thee waking thou wouldst think gently of me</s>  iwonder my kallikrates if thou wouldst tarry till i came again as forso many centuries i have tarried for thy coming</s> then without waiting for an answer she went on come let us besetting forth for we have far to go and before another day is born inyonder blue should we stand in the place of life</s> in five minutes we were once more on our way through the vast ruinedcity which loomed at us on either side in the grey dawning in a waythat was at once grand and oppressive</s>  just as the first ray of therising sun shot like a golden arrow athwart this storied desolation wegained the further gateway of the outer wall and having given one moreglance at the hoar and pillared majesty through which we had journeyedand with the exception of job for whom ruins had no charms breatheda sigh of regret that we had not had more time to explore it passedthrough the great moat and on to the plain beyond</s> as the sun rose so did ayeshas spirits till by breakfasttime they hadregained their normal level and she laughingly set down her previousdepression to the associations of the spot where she had slept</s> these barbarians swear that kr is haunted she said and of a truthi do believe their saying for never did i know so ill a night save one</s> i remember it now</s>  it was on that very spot when thou didst lie dead atmy feet kallikrates</s>  never will i visit it again it is a place of evilomen</s> after a very brief halt for breakfast we pressed on with such good willthat by two oclock in the afternoon we were at the foot of the vastwall of rock that formed the lip of the volcano and which at this pointtowered up precipitously above us for fifteen hundred or two thousandfeet</s>  here we halted certainly not to my astonishment for i did notsee how it was possible that we should go any farther</s> now said ayesha as she descended from her litter doth our labourbut commence for here do we part with these men and henceforward mustwe bear ourselves and then addressing billali do thou and theseslaves remain here and abide our coming</s>  by tomorrow at the middayshall we be with theeif not wait</s> billali bowed humbly and said that her august bidding should be obeyedif they stopped there till they grew old</s> and this man oh holly said she pointing to job best is itthat he should tarry also for if his heart be not high and his couragegreat perchance some evil might overtake him</s>  also the secrets of theplace whither we go are not fit for common eyes</s> i translated this to job who instantly and earnestly entreated mealmost with tears in his eyes not to leave him behind</s>  he said he wassure that he could see nothing worse than he had already seen and thathe was terrified to death at the idea of being left alone with thosedumb folk who he thought would probably take the opportunity tohotpot him</s> i translated what he said to ayesha who shrugged her shoulders andanswered well let him come it is naught to me on his own head beit and he will serve to bear the lamp and this and she pointed to anarrow plank some sixteen feet in length which had been bound abovethe long bearingpole of her hammock as i had thought to make curtainsspread out better but as it now appeared for some unknown purposeconnected with our extraordinary undertaking</s> accordingly the plank which though tough was very light was givento job to carry and also one of the lamps</s>  i slung the other on to myback together with a spare jar of oil while leo loaded himself withthe provisions and some water in a kids skin</s>  when this was done shebade billali and the six bearer mutes to retreat behind a grove offlowering magnolias about a hundred yards away and remain there underpain of death till we had vanished</s>  they bowed humbly and went andas he departed old billali gave me a friendly shake of the hand andwhispered that he had rather that it was i than he who was going on thiswonderful expedition with shewhomustbeobeyed and upon my wordi felt inclined to agree with him</s>  in another minute they were gone andthen having briefly asked us if we were ready ayesha turned and gazedup the towering cliff</s> goodness me leo i said surely we are not going to climb thatprecipice</s> leo shrugged his shoulders being in a condition of halffascinatedhalfexpectant mystification and as he did so ayesha with a suddenmove began to climb the cliff and of course we had to follow her</s>  itwas perfectly marvellous to see the ease and grace with which she sprangfrom rock to rock and swung herself along the ledges</s>  the ascent wasnot however so difficult as it seemed although there were one or twonasty places where it did not do to look behind you the fact being thatthe rock still sloped here and was not absolutely precipitous as it washigher up</s>  in this way we with no great labour mounted to the heightof some fifty feet above our last standingplace the only reallytroublesome thing to manage being jobs board and in doing so drew somefifty or sixty paces to the left of our startingpoint for we went uplike a crab sideways</s>  presently we reached a ledge narrow enough atfirst but which widened as we followed it and moreover sloped inwardslike the petal of a flower so that as we followed it we gradually gotinto a kind of rut or fold of rock that grew deeper and deeper till atlast it resembled a devonshire lane in stone and hid us perfectly fromthe gaze of anybody on the slope below if there had been anybody togaze</s>  this lane which appeared to be a natural formation continuedfor some fifty or sixty paces and then suddenly ended in a cave alsonatural running at right angles to it</s>  i am sure it was a naturalcave and not hollowed by the hand of man because of its irregular andcontorted shape and course which gave it the appearance of having beenblown bodily in the mountain by some frightful eruption of gas followingthe line of the least resistance</s>  all the caves hollowed by the ancientsof kr on the contrary were cut out with the most perfect regularityand symmetry</s>  at the mouth of this cave ayesha halted and bade us lightthe two lamps which i did giving one to her and keeping the othermyself</s>  then taking the lead she advanced down the cavern picking herway with great care as indeed it was necessary to do for the floor wasmost irregularstrewn with boulders like the bed of a stream and insome places pitted with deep holes in which it would have been easy tobreak ones leg</s> this cavern we pursued for twenty minutes or more it being so far asi could form a judgmentowing to its numerous twists and turns no easytaskabout a quarter of a mile long</s> at last however we halted at its farther end and whilst i was stilltrying to pierce the gloom a great gust of air came tearing down it andextinguished both the lamps</s> ayesha called to us and we crept up to her for she was a little infront and were rewarded with a view that was positively appalling inits gloom and grandeur</s>  before us was a mighty chasm in the black rockjagged and torn and splintered through it in a far past age by someawful convulsion of nature as though it had been cleft by stroke uponstroke of the lightning</s>  this chasm which was bounded by a precipice onthe hither and presumably though we could not see it on the fartherside also may have measured any width across but from its darkness ido not think it can have been very broad</s>  it was impossible to make outmuch of its outline or how far it ran for the simple reason that thepoint where we were standing was so far from the upper surface of thecliff at least fifteen hundred or two thousand feet that only a verydim light struggled down to us from above</s>  the mouth of the cavern thatwe had been following gave on to a most curious and tremendous spurof rock which jutted out in mid air into the gulf before us fora distance of some fifty yards coming to a sharp point at itstermination and resembling nothing that i can think of so much as thespur upon the leg of a cock in shape</s>  this huge spur was attached onlyto the parent precipice at its base which was of course enormousjust as the cocks spur is attached to its leg</s>  otherwise it was utterlyunsupported</s> here must we pass said ayesha</s>  be careful lest giddiness overcomeyou or the wind sweep you into the gulf beneath for of a truth it hathno bottom and without giving us any further time to get scared shestarted walking along the spur leaving us to follow her as best wemight</s>  i was next to her then came job painfully dragging his plankwhile leo brought up the rear</s>  it was a wonderful sight to see thisintrepid woman gliding fearlessly along that dreadful place</s>  for mypart when i had gone but a very few yards what between the pressureof the air and the awful sense of the consequences that a slip wouldentail i found it necessary to go down on my hands and knees and crawland so did the other two</s> but ayesha never condescended to this</s>  on she went leaning her bodyagainst the gusts of wind and never seeming to lose her head or herbalance</s> in a few minutes we had crossed some twenty paces of this awful bridgewhich got narrower at every step and then all of a sudden a great gustcame tearing along the gorge</s>  i saw ayesha lean herself against it butthe strong draught got under her dark cloak and tore it from her andaway it went down the wind flapping like a wounded bird</s>  it was dreadfulto see it go till it was lost in the blackness</s>  i clung to the saddleof rock and looked round while like a living thing the great spurvibrated with a humming sound beneath us</s>  the sight was a truly awesomeone</s>  there we were poised in the gloom between earth and heaven</s>  beneathus were hundreds upon hundreds of feet of emptiness that gradually grewdarker till at last it was absolutely black and at what depth it endedis more than i can guess</s>  above was space upon space of giddy air andfar far away a line of blue sky</s>  and down this vast gulf upon which wewere pinnacled the great draught dashed and roared driving clouds andmisty wreaths of vapour before it till we were nearly blinded andutterly confused</s> the whole position was so tremendous and so absolutely unearthly that ibelieve it actually lulled our sense of terror but to this hour i oftensee it in my dreams and at its mere phantasy wake up covered with coldsweat</s> on</s>  on</s>  cried the white form before us for now the cloak had goneshe was robed in white and looked more like a spirit riding down thegale than a woman on or ye will fall and be dashed to pieces</s>  keepyour eyes fixed upon the ground and closely hug the rock</s> we obeyed her and crept painfully along the quivering path againstwhich the wind shrieked and wailed as it shook it causing it to murmurlike a vast tuningfork</s>  on we went i do not know for how long onlygazing round now and again when it was absolutely necessary until atlast we saw that we were on the very tip of the spur a slab of rocklittle larger than an ordinary table that throbbed and jumped like anyoverengined steamer</s>  there we lay clinging to the ground and lookedabout us while ayesha stood leaning out against the wind down whichher long hair streamed and absolutely heedless of the hideous depththat yawned beneath pointed before her</s>  then we saw why the narrowplank had been provided which job and i had painfully dragged alongbetween us</s>  before us was an empty space on the other side of which wassomething as yet we could not see what for hereeither owing to theshadow of the opposite cliff or from some other causethe gloom wasthat of night</s> we must wait awhile called ayesha soon there will be light</s> at the moment i could not imagine what she meant</s>  how could more lightthan there was ever come to this dreadful spot</s>  while i was stillwondering suddenly like a great sword of flame a beam from thesetting sun pierced the stygian gloom and smote upon the point ofrock whereon we lay illumining ayeshas lovely form with an unearthlysplendour</s>  i only wish i could describe the wild and marvellous beautyof that sword of fire laid across the darkness and rushing mistwreathsof the gulf</s>  how it got there i do not to this moment know but ipresume that there was some cleft or hole in the opposing cliff throughwhich it pierced when the setting orb was in a direct line therewith</s> all i can say is that the effect was the most wonderful that i eversaw</s>  right through the heart of the darkness that flaming sword wasstabbed and where it lay there was the most surpassingly vivid lightso vivid that even at a distance we could see the grain of the rockwhile outside of ityes within a few inches of its keen edgewasnaught but clustering shadows</s> and now by this ray of light for which she had been waiting andtimed our arrival to meet knowing that at this season for thousands ofyears it had always struck thus at sunset we saw what was before us</s> within eleven or twelve feet of the very tip of the tonguelike rockwhereon we stood there arose presumably from the far bottom of thegulf a sugarloafshaped cone of which the summit was exactly oppositeto us</s>  but had there been a summit only it would not have helped usmuch for the nearest point of its circumference was some forty feetfrom where we were</s>  on the lip of this summit however which wascircular and hollow rested a tremendous flat boulder something like aglacier stoneperhaps it was one for all i know to the contraryandthe end of this boulder approached to within twelve feet or so of us</s> this huge rock was nothing more or less than a gigantic rockingstoneaccurately balanced upon the edge of the cone or miniature crater likea halfcrown on the rim of a wineglass for in the fierce light thatplayed upon it and us we could see it oscillating in the gusts of wind</s> quick</s>  said ayesha the plankwe must cross while the light endurespresently it will be gone</s> oh lord sir</s>  groaned job surely she dont mean us to walk acrossthat there place on that there thing as in obedience to my directionhe pushed the long board towards me</s> thats it job i halloaed in ghastly merriment though the idea ofwalking the plank was no pleasanter to me than to him</s> i pushed the board on to ayesha who deftly ran it across the gulf sothat one end of it rested on the rockingstone the other remaining onthe extremity of the trembling spur</s>  then placing her foot upon it toprevent it from being blown away she turned to me</s> since i was last here oh holly she called the support of themoving stone hath lessened somewhat so that i am not certain if it willbear our weight or no</s>  therefore will i cross the first because noharm will come unto me and without further ado she trod lightly butfirmly across the frail bridge and in another second was standing safeupon the heaving stone</s> it is safe she called</s>  see hold thou the plank</s>  i will stand onthe farther side of the stone so that it may not overbalance with yourgreater weights</s>  now come oh holly for presently the light will failus</s> i struggled to my knees and if ever i felt terrified in my life it wasthen and i am not ashamed to say that i hesitated and hung back</s> surely thou art not afraid this strange creature called in a lull ofthe gale from where she stood poised like a bird on the highest pointof the rockingstone</s>  make way then for kallikrates</s> this settled me it is better to fall down a precipice and die thanbe laughed at by such a woman so i clenched my teeth and in anotherinstant i was on that horrible narrow bending plank with bottomlessspace beneath and around me</s>  i have always hated a great height butnever before did i realise the full horrors of which such a position iscapable</s>  oh the sickening sensation of that yielding board resting onthe two moving supports</s>  i grew dizzy and thought that i must fallmy spine crept it seemed to me that i was falling and my delight atfinding myself sprawling upon that stone which rose and fell beneath melike a boat in a swell cannot be expressed in words</s>  all i know is thatbriefly but earnestly enough i thanked providence for preserving me sofar</s> then came leos turn and though he looked rather queer he came acrosslike a ropedancer</s>  ayesha stretched out her hand to clasp his own andi heard her say bravely done my lovebravely done</s>  the old greekspirit lives in thee yet</s> and now only poor job remained on the farther side of the gulf</s>  he creptup to the plank and yelled out i cant do it sir</s>  i shall fall intothat beastly place</s> you must i remember saying with inappropriate facetiousnessyoumust job its as easy as catching flies</s>  i suppose that i musthave said it to satisfy my conscience because although the expressionconveys a wonderful idea of facility as a matter of fact i know no moredifficult operation in the whole world than catching fliesthat is inwarm weather unless indeed it is catching mosquitoes</s> i cant siri cant indeed</s> let the man come or let him stop and perish there</s>  see the light isdying</s>  in a moment it will be gone</s>  said ayesha</s> i looked</s>  she was right</s>  the sun was passing below the level of the holeor cleft in the precipice through which the ray reached us</s> if you stop there job you will die alone i called the light isgoing</s> come be a man job roared leo its quite easy</s> thus adjured the miserable job with a most awful yell precipitatedhimself face downwards on the plankhe did not dare small blame tohim to try to walk it and commenced to draw himself across in littlejerks his poor legs hanging down on either side into the nothingnessbeneath</s> his violent jerks at the frail board made the great stone which wasonly balanced on a few inches of rock oscillate in a most dreadfulmanner and to make matters worse when he was halfway across theflying ray of lurid light suddenly went out just as though a lamphad been extinguished in a curtained room leaving the whole howlingwilderness of air black with darkness</s> come on job for gods sake</s>  i shouted in an agony of fear while thestone gathering motion with every swing rocked so violently that itwas difficult to hang on to it</s>  it was a truly awful position</s> lord have mercy on me</s>  cried poor job from the darkness</s>  oh theplanks slipping</s>  and i heard a violent struggle and thought that hewas gone</s> but at that moment his outstretched hand clasping in agony at theair met my own and i hauledah how i did haul putting out allthe strength that it has pleased providence to give me in suchabundanceand to my joy in another minute job was gasping on the rockbeside me</s>  but the plank</s>  i felt it slip and heard it knock against aprojecting knob of rock and it was gone</s> great heavens</s>  i exclaimed</s>  how are we going to get back</s> i dont know answered leo out of the gloom</s>  sufficient to the dayis the evil thereof i am thankful enough to be here</s> but ayesha merely called to me to take her hand and creep after her</s> xxvthe spirit of lifei did as i was bid and in fear and trembling felt myself guided overthe edge of the stone</s>  i sprawled my legs out but could touch nothing</s> i am going to fall</s>  i gasped</s> nay let thyself go and trust to me answered ayesha</s> now if the position is considered it will be easily understood thatthis was a greater demand upon my confidence than was justified by myknowledge of ayeshas character</s>  for all i knew she might be in the veryact of consigning me to a horrible doom</s>  but in life we sometimes haveto lay our faith upon strange altars and so it was now</s> let thyself go</s>  she cried and having no choice i did</s> i felt myself slide a pace or two down the sloping surface of the rockand then pass into the air and the thought flashed through my brainthat i was lost</s>  but no</s>  in another instant my feet struck against arocky floor and i felt that i was standing upon something solid andout of reach of the wind which i could hear singing away overhead</s>  asi stood there thanking heaven for these small mercies there was a slipand a scuffle and down came leo alongside of me</s> hulloa old fellow</s>  he called out are you there</s>  this is gettinginteresting is it not</s> just then with a terrific yell job arrived right on the top of usknocking us both down</s>  by the time we had struggled to our feet againayesha was standing among us and bidding us light the lamps whichfortunately remained uninjured as also did the spare jar of oil</s> i got out my box of wax matches and they struck as merrily there inthat awful place as they could have done in a london drawingroom</s> in a couple of minutes both the lamps were alight and revealed a curiousscene</s>  we were huddled together in a rocky chamber some ten feetsquare and scared enough we looked that is except ayesha who wasstanding calmly with her arms folded and waiting for the lamps to burnup</s>  the chamber appeared to be partly natural and partly hollowed outof the top of the cone</s>  the roof of the natural part was formed of theswinging stone and that of the back part of the chamber which slopeddownwards was hewn from the live rock</s>  for the rest the place was warmand drya perfect haven of rest compared to the giddy pinnacle aboveand the quivering spur that shot out to meet it in midair</s> so</s>  said she safely have we come though once i feared thatthe rocking stone would fall with you and precipitate you into thebottomless depths beneath for i do believe that the cleft goeth downto the very womb of the world</s>  the rock whereon the stone resteth hathcrumbled beneath the swinging weight</s>  and now that he nodding towardsjob who was sitting on the floor feebly wiping his forehead with a redcotton pockethandkerchief whom they rightly call the pig for as apig is he stupid hath let fall the plank it will not be easy to returnacross the gulf and to that end must i make a plan</s>  but now rest awhile and look upon this place</s>  what think ye that it is</s> we know not i answered</s> wouldst thou believe oh holly that once a man did choose this airynest for a daily habitation and did here endure for many years leavingit only but one day in every twelve to seek food and water and oil thatthe people brought more than he could carry and laid as an offering inthe mouth of the tunnel through which we passed hither</s> we looked up wonderingly and she continuedyet so it was</s>  there was a mannoot he named himselfwho thoughhe lived in the latter days had of the wisdom of the sons of kr</s>  ahermit was he and a philosopher and greatly skilled in the secretsof nature and he it was who discovered the fire that i shall show youwhich is natures blood and life and also that he who bathed thereinand breathed thereof should live while nature lives</s>  but like untothee oh holly this man noot would not turn his knowledge to account</s> ill he said was it for man to live for man was born to die</s> therefore did he tell his secret to none and therefore did he come andlive here where the seeker after life must pass and was revered ofthe amahagger of the day as holy and a hermit</s>  and when first i came tothis countryknowest thou how i came kallikrates</s>  another time i willtell thee for it is a strange talei heard of this philosopher andwaited for him when he came to fetch his food and returned with himhither though greatly did i fear to tread the gulf</s>  then did i beguilehim with my beauty and my wit and flatter him with my tongue so thathe led me down and showed me the fire and told me the secrets of thefire but he would not suffer me to step therein and fearing lest heshould slay me i refrained knowing that the man was very old and soonwould die</s>  and i returned having learned from him all that he knew ofthe wonderful spirit of the world and that was much for the manwas wise and very ancient and by purity and abstinence and thecontemplations of his innocent mind had worn thin the veil between thatwhich we see and the great invisible truths the whisper of whose wingsat times we hear as they sweep through the gross air of the world</s> thenit was but a very few days after i met thee my kallikrateswho hadst wandered hither with the beautiful egyptian amenartas and ilearned to love for the first and last time once and for ever so thatit entered into my mind to come hither with thee and receive the giftof life for thee and me</s>  therefore came we with that egyptian who wouldnot be left behind and behold we found the old man noot lying butnewly dead</s>  there he lay and his white beard covered him like agarment and she pointed to a spot near where i was sitting butsurely he hath long since crumbled into dust and the wind hath bornehis ashes hence</s> here i put out my hand and felt in the dust and presently my fingerstouched something</s>  it was a human tooth very yellow but sound</s>  i heldit up and showed it to ayesha who laughed</s> yes she said it is his without a doubt</s>  behold what remaineth ofnoot and the wisdom of nootone little tooth</s>  and yet that man had alllife at his command and for his conscience sake would have none ofit</s>  well he lay there newly dead and we descended whither i shall leadyou and then gathering up all my courage and courting death thati might perchance win so glorious a crown of life i stepped into theflames and behold</s>  life such as ye can never know until ye feel italso flowed into me and i came forth undying and lovely beyondimagining</s>  then did i stretch out mine arms to thee kallikratesand bid thee take thine immortal bride and behold as i spoke thoublinded by my beauty didst turn from me and throw thine arms about theneck of amenartas</s>  and then a great fury filled me and made me madand i seized the javelin that thou didst bear and stabbed thee so thatthere at my very feet in the place of life thou didst groan and godown into death</s>  i knew not then that i had strength to slay with mineeyes and by the power of my will therefore in my madness slew i withthe javelin</s>    it will be observed that ayeshas account of the death  of kallikrates differs materially from that written on the  potsherd by amenartas</s>  the writing on the sherd says then  in her rage did she smite him by her magic and he died</s>   we never ascertained which was the correct version but it  will be remembered that the body of kallikrates had a spear  wound in the breast which seems conclusive unless indeed  it was inflicted after death</s>  another thing that we never  ascertained was how the two womenshe and the egyptian  amenartaswere able to bear the corpse of the man they both  loved across the dread gulf and along the shaking spur</s>  what  a spectacle the two distracted creatures must have presented  in their grief and loveliness as they toiled along that  awful place with the dead man between them</s>  probably however  the passage was easier then</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> and when thou wast dead ah</s>  i wept because i was undying and thouwast dead</s>  i wept there in the place of life so that had i been mortalany more my heart had surely broken</s>  and she the swart egyptianshecursed me by her gods</s>  by osiris did she curse me and by isis bynephthys and by anubis by sekhet the catheaded and by set callingdown evil on me evil and everlasting desolation</s>  ah</s>  i can see her darkface now lowering oer me like a storm but she could not hurt me andii know not if i could hurt her</s>  i did not try it was naught to methen so together we bore thee hence</s>  and afterwards i sent hertheegyptianaway through the swamps and it seems that she lived to beara son and to write the tale that should lead thee her husband back tome her rival and thy murderess</s> such is the tale my love and now is the hour at hand that shall seta crown upon it</s>  like all things on the earth it is compounded of eviland of goodmore of evil than of good perchance and writ in lettersof blood</s>  it is the truth naught have i hidden from thee kallikrates</s> and now one thing before the final moment of thy trial</s>  we go downinto the presence of death for life and death are very near togetherandwho knoweth</s> that might happen which should separate us foranother space of waiting</s>  i am but a woman and no prophetess and icannot read the future</s>  but this i knowfor i learned it from thelips of the wise man nootthat my life is but prolonged and made morebright</s>  it cannot live for aye</s>  therefore before we go tell me ohkallikrates that of a truth thou dost forgive me and dost love me fromthy heart</s>  see kallikrates much evil have i doneperchance it wasevil but two nights ago to strike that girl who loved thee cold indeathbut she disobeyed me and angered me prophesying misfortune tome and i smote</s>  be careful when power comes to thee also lest thoutoo shouldst smite in thine anger or thy jealousy for

altogetherhardened</s>  thy love kallikrates shall be the gate of my redemptioneven as aforetime my passion was the path down which i ran to evil</s>  fordeep love unsatisfied is the hell of noble hearts and a portion of theaccursed but love that is mirrored back more perfect from the soul ofour desired doth fashion wings to lift us above ourselves and makes uswhat we might be</s>  therefore kallikrates take me by the hand and liftmy veil with no more fear than though i were some peasant girl and notthe wisest and most beauteous woman in this wide world and look me inthe eyes and tell me that thou dost forgive me with all thine heartand that will all thine heart thou dost worship me</s> she paused and the strange tenderness in her voice seemed to hoverround us like a memory</s>  i know that the sound of it moved me more eventhan her words it was so very humanso very womanly</s>  leo too wasstrangely touched</s>  hitherto he had been fascinated against his betterjudgment

with theshadow of their wings</s>  as a god shalt thou be holding good and evil inthe hollow of thy hand and i even i i humble myself before thee</s> such is the power of love and such is the bridal gift i give unto theekallikrates my lord and lord of all</s> and now it is done now for thee i loose my virgin zone and comestorm come shine come good come evil come life come death itnever never can be undone</s>  for of a truth that which is is andbeing done is done for aye and cannot be altered</s>  i have saidlet ushence that all things may be accomplished in their order and takingone of the lamps she advanced towards the end of the chamber that wasroofed in by the swaying stone where she halted</s> we followed her and perceived that in the wall of the cone there was astair or to be more accurate that some projecting knobs of rock hadbeen so shaped as to form a good imitation of a stair</s>  down this ayeshabegan to climb springing from step to step like a chamois and afterher we followed with less grace</s>  when we had descended some fifteenor sixteen steps we found that they ended in a tremendous rocky sloperunning first outwards and then inwardslike the slope of an invertedcone or tunnel</s>  the slope was very steep and often precipitous butit was nowhere impassable and by the light of the lamps we went down itwith no great difficulty though it was gloomy work enough travelling onthus no one of us knew whither into the dead heart of a volcano</s>  aswe went however i took the precaution of noting our route as well asi could and this was not so very difficult owing to the extraordinaryand most fantastic shape of the rocks that were strewn about many ofwhich in that dim light looked more like the grim faces carven uponmedival gargoyles than ordinary boulders</s> for a long time we travelled on thus half an hour i should say tillafter we had descended for many hundreds of feet i perceived that wewere reaching the point of the inverted cone</s>  in another minute we werethere and found that at the very apex of the funnel was a passage solow and narrow that we had to stoop as we crept along it in indian file</s> after some fifty yards of this creeping the passage suddenly widenedinto a cave so huge that we could see neither the roof nor the sides</s> we only knew that it was a cave by the echo of our tread and the perfectquiet of the heavy air</s>  on we went for many minutes in absolute awedsilence like lost souls in the depths of hades ayeshas white andghostlike form flitting in front of us till once more the place endedin a passage which opened into a second cavern much smaller than thefirst</s>  indeed we could clearly make out the arch and stony banks ofthis second cave and from their rent and jagged appearance discoveredthat like the first long passage down which we had passed through thecliff before we reached the quivering spur it had to all appearancebeen torn in the bowels of the rock by the terrific force of someexplosive gas</s>  at length this cave ended in a third passage throughwhich gleamed a faint glow of light</s> i heard ayesha give a sigh of relief as this light dawned upon us</s> it is well she said prepare to enter the very womb of the earthwherein she doth conceive the life that ye see brought forth in man andbeastay and in every tree and flower</s> swiftly she sped along and after her we stumbled as best we might ourhearts filled like a cup with mingled dread and curiosity</s>  what were weabout to see</s>  we passed down the tunnel stronger and stronger the lightbeamed reaching us in great flashes like the rays from a lighthouse asone by one they are thrown wide upon the darkness of the waters</s>  nor wasthis all for with the flashes came a soulshaking sound like that ofthunder and of crashing trees</s>  now we were through it andoh heavens</s> we stood in a third cavern some fifty feet in length by perhaps asgreat a height and thirty wide</s>  it was carpeted with fine white sandand its walls had been worn smooth by the action of i know not what</s>  thecavern was not dark like the others it was filled with a soft glow ofrosecoloured light more beautiful to look on than anything that canbe conceived</s>  but at first we saw no flashes and heard no more of thethunderous sound</s>  presently however as we stood in amaze gazing atthe marvellous sight and wondering whence the rosy radiance flowed adread and beautiful thing happened</s>  across the far end of thecavern with a grinding and crashing noisea noise so dreadful andaweinspiring that we all trembled and job actually sank to hiskneesthere flamed out an awful cloud or pillar of fire like a rainbowmanycoloured and like the lightning bright</s>  for a space perhaps fortyseconds it flamed and roared thus turning slowly round and round andthen by degrees the terrible noise ceased and with the fire it passedawayi know not whereleaving behind it the same rosy glow that we hadfirst seen</s> draw near draw near</s>  cried ayesha with a voice of thrillingexultation</s>  behold the very fountain and heart of life as it beats inthe bosom of the great world</s>  behold the substance from which all thingsdraw their energy the bright spirit of the globe without which itcannot live but must grow cold and dead as the dead moon</s>  draw nearand wash you in the living flames and take their virtue into your poorframes in all its virgin strengthnot as it now feebly glows withinyour bosoms filtered thereto through all the fine strainers of athousand intermediate lives but as it is here in the very fount andseat of earthly being</s> we followed her through the rosy glow up to the head of the cave tillat last we stood before the spot where the great pulse beat and thegreat flame passed</s>  and as we went we became sensible of a wild andsplendid exhilaration of a glorious sense of such a fierce intensity oflife that the most buoyant moments of our strength seemed flat and tameand feeble beside it</s>  it was the mere effluvium of the flame the subtleether that it cast off as it passed working on us and making us feelstrong as giants and swift as eagles</s> we reached the head of the cave and gazed at each other in the gloriousglow and laughed aloudeven job laughed and he had not laughed for aweekin the lightness of our hearts and the divine intoxication of ourbrains</s>  i know that i felt as though all the varied genius of which thehuman intellect is capable had descended upon me</s>  i could have spokenin blank verse of shakesperian beauty all sorts of great ideas flashedthrough my mind it was as though the bonds of my flesh had beenloosened and left the spirit free to soar to the empyrean of its nativepower</s>  the sensations that poured in upon me are indescribable</s>  i seemedto live more keenly to reach to a higher joy and sip the goblet of asubtler thought than ever it had been my lot to do before</s>  i was anotherand most glorified self and all the avenues of the possible were for aspace laid open to the footsteps of the real</s> then suddenly whilst i rejoiced in this splendid vigour of a newfoundself from far far away there came a dreadful muttering noise thatgrew and grew to a crash and a roar which combined in itself all thatis terrible and yet splendid in the possibilities of sound</s>  nearer itcame and nearer yet till it was close upon us rolling down like allthe thunderwheels of heaven behind the horses of the lightning</s>  onit came and with it came the glorious blinding cloud of manycolouredlight and stood before us for a space turning as it seemed to usslowly round and round and then accompanied by its attendant pomp ofsound passed away i know not whither</s> so astonishing was the wondrous sight that one and all of us saveshe who stood up and stretched her hands towards the fire sank downbefore it and hid our faces in the sand</s> when it was gone ayesha spoke</s> now kallikrates she said the mighty moment is at hand</s>  when thegreat flame comes again thou must stand in it</s>  first throw aside thygarments for it will burn them though thee it will not hurt</s>  thou muststand in the flame while thy senses will endure and when it embracesthee suck the fire down into thy very heart and let it leap and playaround thy every part so that thou lose no moiety of its virtue</s> hearest thou me kallikrates</s> i hear thee ayesha answered leo but of a truthi am nocowardbut i doubt me of that raging flame</s>  how know i that it willnot utterly destroy me so that i lose myself and lose thee also</s> nevertheless will i do it he added</s> ayesha thought for a minute and then saidit is not wonderful that thou shouldst doubt</s>  tell me kallikratesif thou seest me stand in the flame and come forth unharmed wilt thouenter also</s> yes he answered i will enter even if it slay me</s>  i have said that iwill enter now</s> and that will i also i cried</s> what my holly</s>  she laughed aloud methought that thou wouldst naughtof length of days</s>  why how is this</s> nay i know not i answered but there is that in my heart thatcalleth me to taste of the flame and live</s> it is well she said</s>  thou art not altogether lost in folly</s>  see nowi will for the second time bathe me in this living bath</s>  fain would iadd to my beauty and my length of days if that be possible</s>  if it be notpossible at the least it cannot harm me</s> also she continued after a momentary pause is there another anda deeper cause why i would once again dip me in the flame</s>  when first itasted of its virtue full was my heart of passion and of hatred ofthat egyptian amenartas and therefore despite my strivings to be ridthereof have passion and hatred been stamped upon my soul from that sadhour to this</s>  but now it is otherwise</s>  now is my mood a happy mood andfilled am i with the purest part of thought and so would i ever be</s> therefore kallikrates will i once more wash and make me pure andclean and yet more fit for thee</s>  therefore also when thou dost in turnstand in the fire empty all thy heart of evil and let soft contentmenthold the balance of thy mind</s>  shake loose thy spirits wings and takethy stand upon the utter verge of holy contemplation ay dream upon thymothers kiss and turn thee towards the vision of the highest good thathath ever swept on silver wings across the silence of thy dreams</s>  forfrom the germ of what thou art in that dread moment shall grow the fruitof what thou shalt be for all unreckoned time</s> now prepare thee prepare</s>  even as though thy last hour were at handand thou wast to cross to the land of shadows and not through the gatesof glory into the realms of life made beautiful</s>  prepare i say</s> xxviwhat we sawthen came a few moments pause during which ayesha seemed to begathering up her strength for the fiery trial while we clung to eachother and waited in utter silence</s> at last from far far away came the first murmur of sound that grewand grew till it began to crash and bellow in the distance</s>  as she heardit ayesha swiftly threw off her gauzy wrapping loosened the goldensnake from her kirtle and then shaking her lovely hair about her likea garment beneath its cover slipped the kirtle off and replaced thesnaky belt around her and outside the masses of her falling hair</s>  thereshe stood before us as eve might have stood before adam clad in nothingbut her abundant locks held round her by the golden band and no wordsof mine can tell how sweet she lookedand yet how divine</s>  nearer andnearer came the thunderwheels of fire and as they came she pushed oneivory arm through the dark masses of her hair and flung it round leosneck</s> oh my love my love</s>  she murmured wilt thou ever know how i haveloved thee</s>  and she kissed him on the forehead and then went and stoodin the pathway of the flame of life</s> there was i remember to my mind something very touching about herwords and that embrace upon the forehead</s>  it was like a mothers kissand seemed to convey a benediction with it</s> on came the crashing rolling noise and the sound of it was as thesound of a forest being swept flat by a mighty wind and then tossedup like so much grass and thundered down a mountainside</s>  nearer andnearer it came now flashes of light forerunners of the revolvingpillar of flame were passing like arrows through the rosy air and nowthe edge of the pillar itself appeared</s>  ayesha turned towards it andstretched out her arms to greet it</s>  on it came very slowly and lappedher round with flame</s>  i saw the fire run up her form</s>  i saw her lift itwith both hands as though it were water and pour it over her head</s>  ieven saw her open her mouth and draw it down into her lungs and a dreadand wonderful sight it was</s> then she paused and stretched out her arms and stood there quitestill with a heavenly smile upon her face as though she were the veryspirit of the flame</s> the mysterious fire played up and down her dark and rolling lockstwining and twisting itself through and around them like threads ofgolden lace it gleamed upon her ivory breast and shoulder from whichthe hair had slipped aside it slid along her pillared throat anddelicate features and seemed to find a home in the glorious eyes thatshone and shone more brightly even than the spiritual essence</s> oh how beautiful she looked there in the flame</s>  no angel out of heavencould have worn a greater loveliness</s>  even now my heart faints beforethe recollection of it as she stood and smiled at our awed faces andi would give half my remaining time upon this earth to see her once likethat again</s> but suddenlymore suddenly than i can describea kind of change cameover her face a change which i could not define or explain but nonethe less a change</s>  the smile vanished and in its place there came adry hard look the rounded face seemed to grow pinched as though somegreat anxiety were leaving its impress upon it</s>  the glorious eyes toolost their light and as i thought the form its perfect shape anderectness</s> i rubbed my eyes thinking that i was the victim of some hallucinationor that the refraction from the intense light produced an opticaldelusion and as i did so the flaming pillar slowly twisted andthundered off whithersoever it passes to in the bowels of the greatearth leaving ayesha standing where it had been</s> as soon as it was gone she stepped forward to leos sideit seemed tome that there was no spring in her stepand stretched out her handto lay it on his shoulder</s>  i gazed at her arm</s>  where was its wonderfulroundness and beauty</s>  it was getting thin and angular</s>  and her facebyheaven</s> her face was growing old before my eyes</s>  i suppose that leosaw it also certainly he recoiled a step or two</s> what is it my kallikrates</s>  she said and her voicewhat was thematter with those deep and thrilling notes</s>  they were quite high andcracked</s> why what is itwhat is it</s>  she said confusedly</s>  i feel dazed</s> surely the quality of the fire hath not altered</s>  can the principle oflife alter</s>  tell me kallikrates is there aught wrong with my eyes</s> i see not clear and she put her hand to her head and touched

in the living presence of thatterrible recollectionshe was shrivelling up the golden snake thathad encircled her gracious form slipped over her hips and to the groundsmaller and smaller she grew her skin changed colour and in place ofthe perfect whiteness of its lustre it turned dirty brown and yellowlike an piece of withered parchment</s>  she felt at her head thedelicate hand was nothing but a claw now a human talon like that of abadlypreserved egyptian mummy and then she seemed to realise what kindof change was passing over her and she shriekedah she shrieked</s> sherolled upon the floor and shrieked</s> smaller she grew and smaller yet till she was no larger than a monkey</s> now the skin was puckered into a million wrinkles and on the shapelessface was the stamp of unutterable age</s>  i never saw anything like itnobody ever saw anything like the frightful age that was graven on thatfearful countenance no bigger now than that of a twomonths childthough the skull remained the same size or nearly so and let all menpray they never may if they wish to keep their reason</s> at last she lay still or only feebly moving</s>  she who but two minutesbefore had gazed upon us the loveliest noblest most splendid woman theworld has ever seen she lay still before us near the masses of her owndark hair no larger than a big monkey and hideousah too hideous forwords</s>  and yet think of thisat that very moment i thought of ititwas the same woman</s> she was dying we saw it and thanked godfor while she lived she couldfeel and what must she have felt</s>  she raised herself upon her bonyhands and blindly gazed around her swaying her head slowly from sideto side as a tortoise does</s>  she could not see for her whitish eyes werecovered with a horny film</s>  oh the horrible pathos of the sight</s>
 but shecould still speak</s> kallikrates she said in husky trembling notes</s>  forget me notkallikrates</s>  have pity on my shame i shall come again and shall oncemore be beautiful i swear itit is

not how long we remained thus</s>  many hours i suppose</s>  when atlast i opened my eyes the other two were still outstretched uponthe floor</s>  the rosy light yet beamed like a celestial dawn and thethunderwheels of the spirit of life yet rolled upon their accustomedtrack for as i awoke the great pillar was passing away</s>  there too laythe hideous little monkey frame covered with crinkled yellow parchmentthat once had been the glorious she</s>  alas</s>  it was no hideous dreamitwas an awful and unparalleled fact</s> what had happened to bring this shocking change about</s>  had the natureof the lifegiving fire changed</s>  did it perhaps from time to time sendforth an essence of death instead of an essence of life</s>  or was it thatthe frame once charged with its marvellous virtue could bear no moreso that were the process repeatedit mattered not at what lapse oftimethe two impregnations neutralised each other and left the bodyon which they acted as it was before it ever came into contact with thevery essence of life</s>  this and this alone would account for the suddenand terrible ageing of ayesha as the whole length of her two thousandyears took effect upon her</s>  i have not the slightest doubt myself butthat the frame now lying before me was just what the frame of a womanwould be if by any extraordinary means life could be preserved in hertill she at length died at the age of twoandtwenty centuries</s> but who can tell what had happened</s>  there was the fact</s>  often since thatawful hour i have reflected that it requires no great imagination to seethe finger of providence in the matter</s>  ayesha locked up in her livingtomb waiting from age to age for the coming of her lover worked but asmall change in the order of the world</s>  but ayesha strong and happy inher love clothed in immortal youth and goddess beauty and the wisdomof the centuries would have revolutionised society and even perchancehave changed the destiny of mankind</s>  thus she opposed herself againstthe eternal law and strong though she was by it was swept back tonothingnessswept back with shame and hideous mockery</s> for some minutes i lay faintly turning these terrors over in my mindwhile my physical strength came back to me which it quickly did in thatbuoyant atmosphere</s>  then i bethought me of the others and staggeredto my feet to see if i could arouse them</s>  but first i took up ayeshaskirtle and the gauzy scarf with which she had been wont to hide herdazzling loveliness from the eyes of men and averting my head so thati might not look upon it covered up that dreadful relic of the gloriousdead that shocking epitome of human beauty and human life</s>  i did thishurriedly fearing lest leo should recover and see it again</s> then stepping over the perfumed masses of dark hair that lay upon thesand i stooped down by job who was lying upon his face and turned himover</s>  as i did so his arm fell back in a way that i did not like andwhich sent a chill through me and i glanced sharply at him</s>  one lookwas enough</s>  our old and faithful servant was dead</s>  his nerves alreadyshattered by all he had seen and undergone had utterly broken downbeneath this last dire sight and he had died of terror or in a fitbrought on by terror</s>  i had only to look at his face to see it</s> it was another blow but perhaps it may help people to understand howoverwhelmingly awful was the experience through which we had passedwedid not feel it much at the time</s>  it seemed quite natural that the poorfellow should be dead</s>  when leo came to himself which he did with agroan and trembling of the limbs about ten minutes afterwards and itold him that job was dead he merely said oh</s>  and mind you thiswas from no heartlessness for he and job were much attached to eachother and he often talks of him now with the deepest regret andaffection</s>  it was only that his nerves would bear no more</s>  a harp cangive out but a certain quantity of sound however heavily it is smitten</s> well i set myself to recovering leo who to my infinite relief ifound was not dead but only fainting and in the end i succeeded as ihave said and he sat up and then i saw another dreadful thing</s>  when weentered that awful place his curling hair had been of the ruddiest goldnow it was turning grey and by the time we reached the outer air it wassnow white</s>  besides he looked twenty years older</s> what is to be done old fellow</s>  he said in a hollow dead sort ofvoice when his mind had cleared a little and a recollection of whathad happened forced itself upon it</s> try and get out i suppose i answered that is unless you wouldlike to go in there and i pointed to the column of fire that was oncemore rolling by</s> i would go in if i were sure that it would kill me he said with alittle laugh</s>  it was my cursed hesitation that did this</s>  if i had notbeen doubtful she might never have tried to show me the road</s>  but i amnot sure</s>  the fire might have the opposite effect upon me</s>  it might makeme immortal and old fellow i have not the patience to wait a coupleof thousand years for her to come back again as she did for me</s>  i hadrather die when my hour comesand i should fancy that it isnt far offeitherand go my ways to look for her</s>  do you go in if you like</s> but i merely shook my head my excitement was as dead as ditchwaterand my distaste for the prolongation of my mortal span had come backupon me more strongly than ever</s>  besides we neither of us knew what theeffects of the fire might be</s>  the result upon she had not been of anencouraging nature and of the exact causes that produced that result wewere of course ignorant</s> well my boy i said we cannot stop here till we go the way of thosetwo and i pointed to the little heap under the white garment and tothe stiffing corpse of poor job</s>  if we are going we had better go</s>  butby the way i expect that the lamps have burnt out

 with a tremblinghand i filled the lampsluckily there was still some of the linen wickunburnt</s>  then i lit them with one of our wax matches</s>  while i did sowe heard the pillar of fire approaching once more as it went on itsneverending journey if indeed it was the same pillar that passed andrepassed in a circle</s> lets see it come once more said leo we shall never look upon itslike again in this world</s> it seemed a bit of idle curiosity but somehow i shared it and so wewaited till turning slowly round upon its own axis it had flamed andthundered by and i remember wondering for how many thousands of yearsthis same phenomenon had been taking place in the bowels of the earthand for how many more thousands it would continue to take place</s>  iwondered also if any mortal eyes would ever again mark its passage orany mortal ears be thrilled and fascinated by the swelling volume of itsmajestic sound</s>  i do not think that they will</s>  i believe that we are thelast human beings who will ever see that unearthly sight</s>  presently ithad gone and we too turned to go</s> but before we did so we each took jobs cold hand in ours and shook it</s> it was a rather ghastly ceremony but it was the only means in ourpower of showing our respect to the faithful dead and of celebrating hisobsequies</s>  the heap beneath the white garment we did not uncover</s>  we hadno wish to look upon that terrible sight again</s>  but we went to the pileof rippling hair that had fallen from her in the agony of that hideouschange which was worse than a thousand natural deaths and each of usdrew from it a shining lock and these locks we still have the solememento that is left to us of ayesha as we knew her in the fulness ofher grace and glory</s>  leo pressed the perfumed hair to his lips</s> she called to me not to forget her he said hoarsely and swore thatwe should meet again</s>  by heaven</s>  i never will forget her</s>  here i swearthat if we live to get out of this i

beautiful as we knewher</s>  but supposing she came back like that</s>    what a terrifying reflection it is by the way that  nearly all our deep love for women who are not our kindred  dependsat any

then with hearts far too heavy for words we left them andcrept thence brokendown menso broken down that we even renounced thechance of practically immortal life because all that made life valuablehad gone from us and we knew even then that to prolong our daysindefinitely would only be to prolong our sufferings</s>  for we feltyesboth of usthat having once looked ayesha in the eyes we could notforget her for ever and ever while memory and identity remained</s>  weboth loved her now and for all time she was stamped and carven on ourhearts and no other woman or interest could ever raze

gentle friendship and a little show of thanks for my devotion toherand leo</s> if that does not constitute true love i do not know what does and alli have to say is that it is a very bad state of affairs for a man on thewrong side of middle age to fall into</s> xxviiwe leapwe passed through the caves without trouble but when we came to theslope of the inverted cone two difficulties stared us in the face</s>  thefirst of these was the laborious nature of the ascent and the next theextreme difficulty of finding our way</s>  indeed had it not been for themental notes that i had fortunately taken of the shape of various rocksi am sure that we never should have managed it at all but have wanderedabout in the dreadful womb of the volcanofor i suppose it mustonce have been something of the sortuntil we died of exhaustion anddespair</s>  as it was we went wrong several times and once nearly fellinto a huge crack or crevasse</s>  it was terrible work creeping aboutin the dense gloom and awful stillness from boulder to boulderand examining it by the feeble light of the lamps to see if i couldrecognise its shape</s>  we rarely spoke our hearts were too heavyfor speech we simply stumbled about falling sometimes and cuttingourselves in a rather dogged sort of way</s>  the fact was that our spiritswere utterly crushed and we did not greatly care what happened to us</s> only we felt bound to try and save our lives whilst we could and indeeda natural instinct prompted us to it</s>  so for some three or four hoursi should thinki cannot tell exactly how long for we had no watchleft that would gowe blundered on</s>  during the last two hours we werecompletely lost and i began to fear that we had got into the funnel ofsome subsidiary cone when at last i suddenly recognised a very largerock which we had passed in descending but a little way from the top</s> it is a marvel that i should have recognised it and indeed wehad already passed it going at right angles to the proper path whensomething about it struck me and i turned back and examined it in anidle sort of way and as it happened this proved our salvation</s> after this we gained the rocky natural stair without much furthertrouble and in due course found ourselves back in the little chamberwhere the benighted noot had lived and died</s> but now a fresh terror stared us in the face</s>  it will be remembered thatowing to jobs fear and awkwardness the plank upon which we had crossedfrom the huge spur to the rockingstone had been whirled off into thetremendous gulf below</s> how were we to cross without the plank</s> there was only one answerwe must try and jump it or else stop theretill we starved</s>  the distance in itself was not so very great betweeneleven and twelve feet i should think and i have seen leo jump overtwenty when he was a young fellow at collage but then think of theconditions</s>  two weary wornout men one of them on the wrong side offorty a rockingstone to take off from a trembling point of rock somefew feet across to land upon and a bottomless gulf to be cleared in araging gale</s>  it was bad enough god knows but when i pointed out thesethings to leo he put the whole matter in a nutshell by replying thatmerciless as the choice was we must choose between the certainty of alingering death in the chamber and the risk of a swift one in the air</s> of course there was no arguing against this but one thing was clearwe could not attempt that leap in the dark the only thing to do was towait for the ray of light which pierced through the gulf at sunset</s> how near to or how far from sunset we might be neither of us had thefaintest notion all we did know was that when at last the light cameit would not endure more than a couple of minutes at the outside sothat we must be prepared to meet it</s>  accordingly we made up our mindsto creep on to the top of the rockingstone and lie there in readiness</s> we were the more easily reconciled to this course by the fact that ourlamps were once more nearly exhaustedindeed one had gone out bodilyand the other was jumping up and down as the flame of a lamp does whenthe oil is done</s>  so by the aid of its dying light we hastened to crawlout of the little chamber and clamber up the side of the great stone</s> as we did so the light went out</s> the difference in our position was a sufficiently remarkable one</s> below in the little chamber we had only heard the roaring of thegale overheadhere lying on our faces on the swinging stone we wereexposed to its full force and fury as the great draught drew first fromthis direction and then from that howling against the mighty precipiceand through the rocky cliffs like ten thousand despairing souls</s>  we laythere hour after hour in terror and misery of mind so deep that i willnot attempt to describe it and listened to the wild stormvoicesof that tartarus as set to the deep undertone of the spur oppositeagainst which the wind hummed like some awful harp they called to eachother from precipice to precipice</s>  no nightmare dreamed by man no wildinvention of the romancer can ever equal the living horror of thatplace and the weird crying of those voices of the night as we clunglike shipwrecked mariners to a raft and tossed on the black unfathomedwilderness of air</s>  fortunately the temperature was not a low oneindeed the wind was warm or we should have perished</s>  so we clung andlistened and while we were stretched out upon the rock a thing happenedwhich was so curious and suggestive in itself though doubtless a merecoincidence that if anything it added to rather than deducted fromthe burden on our nerves</s> it will be remembered that when ayesha was standing on the spur beforewe crossed to the stone the wind tore her cloak from her and whirledit away into the darkness of the gulf we could not see whither</s>  wellihardly like to tell the story it is so strange</s>  as we lay there uponthe rockingstone this very cloak came floating out of the black spacelike a memory from the dead and fell on leoso that it covered himnearly from head to foot</s>  we could not at first make out what it wasbut soon discovered by its feel and then poor leo for the first timegave way and i heard him sobbing there upon the stone</s>  no doubt thecloak had been caught upon some pinnacle of the cliff and was thenceblown hither by a chance gust but still it was a most curious andtouching incident</s> shortly after this suddenly without the slightest previous warningthe great red knife of light came stabbing the darkness through andthroughstruck the swaying stone on which we were and rested its sharppoint upon the spur opposite</s> now for it said leo now or never</s> we rose and stretched ourselves and looked at the cloudwreaths stainedthe colour of blood by that red ray as they tore through the sickeningdepths beneath and then at the empty space between the swaying stoneand the quivering rock and in our hearts despaired and prepared fordeath</s>  surely we could not clear itdesperate though we were</s> who is to go first</s>  said i</s> do you old fellow answered leo</s>  i will sit upon the other side ofthe stone to steady it</s>  you must take as much run as you can and jumphigh and god have mercy on us say i</s> i acquiesced with a nod and then i did a thing i had never done sinceleo was a little boy</s>  i turned and put my arm round him and kissed himon the forehead</s>  it sounds rather french but as a fact i was taking mylast farewell of a man whom i could not have loved more if he had beenmy own son twice over</s> goodbye my boy i said i hope that we shall meet again whereverit is that we go to</s> the fact was i did not expect to live another two minutes</s> next i retreated to the far side of the rock and waited till one of thechopping gusts of wind got behind me and then i ran the length of thehuge stone some three or four and thirty feet and sprang wildly outinto the dizzy air</s>  oh</s>  the sickening terrors that i felt as i launchedmyself at that little point of rock and the horrible sense of despairthat shot through my brain as i realised that i had jumped short</s>  butso it was my feet never touched the point they went down into spaceonly my hands and body came in contact with it</s>  i gripped at it witha yell but one hand slipped and i swung right round holding by theother so that i faced the stone from which i had sprung</s>  wildly istretched up with my left hand and this time managed to grasp a knob ofrock and there i hung in the fierce red light with thousands of feetof empty air beneath me</s>  my hands were holding to either side ofthe under part of the spur so that its point was touching my head</s> therefore even if i could have found the strength i could not pullmyself up</s>  the most that i could do would be to hang for about a minuteand then drop down down into the bottomless pit</s>  if any man can imaginea more hideous position let him speak</s>  all i know is that the tortureof that halfminute nearly turned my brain</s> i heard leo give a cry and then suddenly saw him in mid air springingup and out like a chamois</s>  it was a splendid leap that he took under theinfluence of his terror and despair clearing the horrible gulf as if itwere nothing and landing well on to the rocky point he threw himselfupon his face to prevent his pitching off into the depths</s>  i felt thespur above me shake beneath the shock of his impact and as it did so isaw the huge rockingstone that had been violently depressed by him ashe sprang fly back when relieved of his weight till for the first timeduring all these centuries it got beyond its balance fell with amost awful crash right into the rocky chamber which had once served thephilosopher noot for a hermitage and i have no doubt for ever sealedthe passage that leads to the place of life with some hundreds of tonsof rock</s> all this happened in a second and curiously enough notwithstanding myterrible position i noted it involuntarily as it were</s>  i even rememberthinking that no human being would go down that dread path again</s> next instant i felt leo seize me by the right wrist with both hands</s>  bylying flat on the point of rock he could just reach me</s> you must let go and swing yourself clear he said in a calm andcollected voice and then i will try and pull you up or we will bothgo together</s>  are you ready</s> by way of answer i let go first with my left hand and then with theright and as a consequence swayed out clear of the overshadowingrock my weight hanging upon leos arms</s>  it was a dreadful moment</s>  hewas a very powerful man i knew but would his strength be equal tolifting me up till i could get a hold on the top of the spur when owingto his position he had so little purchase</s> for a few seconds i swung to and fro while he gathered himself for theeffort and then i heard his sinews cracking above me and felt myselflifted up as though i were a little child till i got my left arm roundthe rock and my chest was resting on it</s>  the rest was easy in two orthree more seconds i was up and we were lying panting side by sidetrembling like leaves and with the cold perspiration of terror pouringfrom our skins</s> and then as before the light went out like a lamp</s> for some halfhour we lay thus without speaking a word and then atlength began to creep along the great spur as best we might in the densegloom</s>  as we drew towards the face of the cliff however from which thespur sprang out like a spike from a wall the light increased thoughonly a very little for it was night overhead</s>  after that the gusts ofwind decreased and we got along rather better and at last reached themouth of the first cave or tunnel</s>  but now a fresh trouble stared asin the face our oil was gone and the lamps were no doubt crushed topowder beneath the fallen rockingstone</s>  we were even without a drop ofwater to stay our thirst for we had drunk the last in the chamberof noot</s>  how were we to see to make our way through this lastboulderstrewn tunnel</s> clearly all that we could do was to trust to our sense of feeling andattempt the passage in the dark so in we crept fearing that ifwe delayed to do so our exhaustion would overcome us and we shouldprobably lie down and die where we were</s> oh the horrors of that last tunnel</s>  the place was strewn with rocksand we fell over them and knocked ourselves up against them till wewere bleeding from a score of wounds</s>  our only guide was the side ofthe cavern which we kept touching and so bewildered did we grow in thedarkness that we were several times seized with the terrifying thoughtthat we had turned and were travelling the wrong way</s>  on we wentfeebly and still more feebly for hour after hour stopping every fewminutes to rest for our strength was spent</s>  once we fell asleep and ithink must have slept for some hours for when we woke our limbs werequite stiff and the blood from our blows and scratches had caked andwas hard and dry upon our skin</s>  then we dragged ourselves on again tillat last when despair was entering into our hearts we once more saw thelight of day and found ourselves outside the tunnel in the rocky foldon the outer surface of the cliff that it will be remembered led intoit</s> it was early morningthat we could tell by the feel of the sweet airand the look of the blessed sky which we had never hoped to see again</s> it was so near as we knew an hour after sunset when we entered thetunnel so it followed that it had taken us the entire night to crawlthrough that dreadful place</s> one more effort leo i gasped and we shall reach the slope wherebillali is if he hasnt gone</s>  come dont give way for he had casthimself upon his face</s>  he rose and leaning on each other we got downthat fifty feet or so of cliffsomehow i have not the least notionhow</s>  i only remember that we found ourselves lying in a heap at thebottom and then once more began to drag ourselves along on our handsand knees towards the grove where she had told billali to wait herrearrival for we could not walk another foot</s>  we had not gone fiftyyards in this fashion when suddenly one of the mutes emerged fromthe trees on our left through which i presume he had been taking amorning stroll and came running up to see what sort of strange animalswe were</s>  he stared and stared and then held up his hands in horrorand nearly fell to the ground</s>  next he started off as hard as hecould for the grove some two hundred yards away</s>  no wonder that he washorrified at our appearance for we must have been a shocking sight</s> to begin leo with his golden curls turned a snowy white his clothesnearly rent from his body his worn face and his hands a mass ofbruises cuts and bloodencrusted filth was a sufficiently alarmingspectacle as he painfully dragged himself along the ground and ihave no doubt that i was little better to look on</s>  i know that two daysafterwards when i inspected my face in some water i scarcely recognisedmyself</s>  i have never been famous for beauty but there was somethingbeside ugliness stamped upon my features that i have never got ridof until this day something resembling that wild look with which astartled person wakes from deep sleep more than anything else that i canthink of</s>  and really it is not to be wondered at</s>  what i do wonder at isthat we escaped at all with our reason</s> presently to my intense relief i saw old billali hurrying towardsus and even then i could scarcely help smiling at the expression ofconsternation on his dignified countenance</s> oh my baboon</s>  my baboon</s>  he cried my dear son is it indeed theeand the lion</s>  why his mane that was ripe as corn is white likethe snow</s>  whence come ye</s>  and where is the pig and where tooshewhomustbeobeyed</s> dead both dead i answered but ask no questions help us and giveus food and water or we too shall die before thine eyes</s>  seest thou notthat our tongues are black for want of water</s>  how then can we talk</s> dead</s>  he gasped</s>  impossible</s>  she who never diesdead how can itbe</s>  and then perceiving i think that his face was being watched bythe mutes who had come running up he checked himself and motioned tothem to carry us to the camp which they did</s> fortunately when we arrived some broth was boiling on the fire and withthis billali fed us for we were too weak to feed ourselves therebyi firmly believe saving us from death by exhaustion</s>  then he bade themutes wash the blood and grime from us with wet cloths and after thatwe were laid down upon piles of aromatic grass and instantly fell intothe dead sleep of absolute exhaustion of mind and body</s> xxviiiover the mountainthe next thing i recollect is a feeling of the most dreadful stiffnessand a sort of vague idea passing through my halfawakened brain that iwas a carpet that had just been beaten</s>  i opened my eyes and the firstthing they fell on was the venerable countenance of our old friendbillali who was seated by the side of the improvised bed upon which iwas sleeping and thoughtfully stroking his long beard</s>  the sight ofhim at once brought back to my mind a recollection of all that we hadrecently passed through which was accentuated by the vision of poorleo lying opposite to me his face knocked almost to a jelly and hisbeautiful crowd of curls turned from yellow to white and i shut myeyes again and groaned</s>    curiously enough leos hair has lately been to some  extent regaining its colourthat is to say it is now a  yellowish grey and i am not without hopes that it will in  time come quite right</s> l</s>  h</s>  h</s> thou hast slept long my baboon said old billali</s> how long my father</s>  i asked</s> a round of the sun and a round of the moon a day and a night hast thouslept and the lion also</s>  see he sleepeth yet</s> blessed is sleep i answered for it swallows up recollection</s> tell me he said what hath befallen you and what is this strangestory of the death of her who dieth not</s>  bethink thee my son if thisbe true then is thy danger and the danger of the lion very greatnayalmost is the pot red wherewith ye shall be potted and the stomachs ofthose who shall eat ye are already hungry for the feast</s>  knowest thounot that these amahagger my children these dwellers in the caveshate ye</s>  they hate ye as strangers they hate ye more because of theirbrethren whom she put to the torment for your sake</s>  assuredly if oncethey learn that there is naught to fear from hiya from the terribleonewhomustbeobeyed they will slay ye by the pot</s>  but let me hearthy tale my poor baboon</s> this adjured i set to work and told himnot everything indeed fori did not think it desirable to do so but sufficient for my purposewhich was to make him understand that she was really no more havingfallen into some fire and as i put itfor the real thing would havebeen incomprehensible to himbeen burnt up</s>  i also told him some of thehorrors we had undergone in effecting our escape and these produced agreat impression on him</s>  but i clearly saw that he did not believe inthe report of ayeshas death</s>  he believed indeed that we thoughtthat she was dead but his explanation was that it had suited her todisappear for a while</s>  once he said in his fathers time she had doneso for twelve years and there was a tradition in the country that manycenturies back no one had seen her for a whole generation when shesuddenly reappeared and destroyed a woman who had assumed the positionof queen</s>  i said nothing to this but only shook my head sadly</s>  alas</s> i knew too well that ayesha would appear no more or at any rate thatbillali would never see her again</s> and now concluded billali what wouldst thou do my baboon</s> nay i said i know not my father</s>  can we not escape from thiscountry</s> he shook his head</s> it is very difficult</s>  by kr ye cannot pass for ye would be seenand as soon as those fierce ones found that ye were alone well andhe smiled significantly and made a movement as though he were placing ahat on his head</s>  but there is a way over the cliff whereof i once spaketo thee where they drive the cattle out to pasture</s>  then beyond thepastures are three days journey through the marshes and after thati know not but i have heard that seven days journey from thence isa mighty river which floweth to the black water</s>  if ye could comethither perchance ye might escape but how can ye come thither</s> billali i said once thou knowest i did save thy life</s>  now payback the debt my father and save me mine and my friends the lions</s> it shall be a pleasant thing for thee to think of when thine hour comesand something to set in the scale against the evil doing of thy days ifperchance thou hast done any evil</s>  also if thou be right and if shedoth but hide herself surely when she comes again she shall rewardthee</s> my son the baboon answered the old man think not that i have anungrateful heart</s>  well do i remember how thou didst rescue me when thosedogs stood by to see me drown</s>  measure for measure will i give theeand if thou canst be saved surely i will save thee</s>  listen by dawntomorrow be prepared for litters shall be here to bear ye away acrossthe mountains and through the marshes beyond</s>  this will i do sayingthat it is the word of she that it be done and he who obeyeth not theword of she food is he for the hynas</s>  then when ye have crossed themarshes ye must strike with your own hands so that perchance if goodfortune go with you ye may live to come to that black water whereof yetold me</s>  and now see the lion wakes and ye must eat the food i havemade ready for you</s> leos condition when once he was fairly aroused proved not to be sobad as might have been expected from his appearance and we both of usmanaged to eat a hearty meal which indeed we needed sadly enough</s>  afterthis we limped down to the spring and bathed and then came back andslept again till evening when we once more ate enough for five</s>  billaliwas away all that day no doubt making arrangements about litters andbearers for we were awakened in the middle of the night by the arrivalof a considerable number of men in the little camp</s> at dawn the old man himself appeared and told us that he had by usingshes dreadful name though with some difficulty succeeded in gettingthe necessary men and two guides to conduct us across the swamps andthat he urged us to start at once at the same time announcing hisintention of accompanying us so as to protect us against treachery</s>  iwas much touched by this act of kindness on the part of that wily oldbarbarian towards two utterly defenceless strangers</s>  a threeor inhis case for he would have to return sixdays journey through thosedeadly swamps was no light undertaking for a man of his age but heconsented to do it cheerfully in order to promote our safety</s>  it showsthat even among those dreadful amahaggerwho are certainly with theirgloom and their devilish and ferocious rites by far the most terriblesavages that i ever heard ofthere are people with kindly hearts</s>  ofcourse selfinterest may have had something to do with it</s>  he may havethought that she would suddenly reappear and demand an account of usat his hands but still allowing for all deductions it was a greatdeal more than we could expect under the circumstances and i can onlysay that i shall for as long as i live cherish a most affectionateremembrance of my nominal parent old billali</s> accordingly after swallowing some food we started in the littersfeeling so far as our bodies went wonderfully like our old selvesafter our long rest and sleep</s>  i must leave the condition of our mindsto the imagination</s> then came a terrible pull up the cliff</s>  sometimes the ascent was morenatural more often it was a zigzag roadway cut no doubt in the firstinstance by the old inhabitants of kr</s>  the amahagger say they drivetheir spare cattle over it once a year to pasture outside all i know isthat those cattle must be uncommonly active on their feet</s>  of course thelitters were useless here so we had to walk</s> by midday however we reached the great flat top of that mighty wall ofrock and grand enough the view was from it with the plain of kr inthe centre of which we could clearly make out the pillared ruins of thetemple of truth to the one side and the boundless and melancholy marshon the other</s>  this wall of rock which had no doubt once formed the lipof the crater was about a mile and a half thick and still covered withclinker</s>  nothing grew there and the only thing to relieve our eyes wereoccasional pools of rainwater for rain had lately fallen whereverthere was a little hollow</s>  over the flat crest of this mighty rampart wewent and then came the descent which if not so difficult a matteras the getting up was still sufficiently breakneck and took us tillsunset</s>  that night however we camped in safety upon the mighty slopesthat rolled away to the marsh beneath</s> on the following morning about eleven oclock began our dreary journeyacross those awful seas of swamps which i have already described</s> for three whole days through stench and mire and the allprevailingflavour of fear did our bearers struggle along till at length we cameto open rolling ground quite uncultivated and mostly treeless butcovered with game of all sorts which lies beyond that most desolateand without guides utterly impracticable district</s>  and here on thefollowing morning we bade farewell not without some regret to oldbillali who stroked his white beard and solemnly blessed us</s> farewell my son the baboon he said and farewell to thee too ohlion</s>  i can do no more to help you</s>  but if ever ye come to your countrybe advised and venture no more into lands that ye know not lest yecome back no more but leave your white bones to mark the limit of yourjourneyings</s>  farewell once more often shall i think of you nor wiltthou forget me my baboon for though thy face is ugly thy heart istrue</s>  and then he turned and went and with him went the tall andsullenlooking bearers and that was the last that we saw of theamahagger</s>  we watched them winding away with the empty litters like aprocession bearing dead men from a battle till the mists from the marshgathered round them and hid them and then left utterly desolate in thevast wilderness we turned and gazed round us and at each other</s> three weeks or so before four men had entered the marshes of kr andnow two of us were dead and the other two had gone through adventuresand experiences so strange and terrible that death himself hath not amore fearful countenance</s>  three weeksand only three weeks</s>  truly timeshould be measured by events and not by the lapse of hours</s>  it seemedlike thirty years since we saw the last of our whaleboat</s> we must strike out for the zambesi leo i said but god knows if weshall ever get there</s> leo nodded</s>  he had become very silent of late and we started withnothing but the clothes we stood in a compass our revolvers andexpress rifles and about two hundred rounds of ammunition and so endedthe history of our visit to the ancient ruins of mighty and imperialkr</s> as for the adventures that subsequently befell us strange and variedas they were i have after deliberation determined not to record themhere</s>  in these pages i have only tried to give a short and clear accountof an occurrence which i believe to be unprecedented and this i havedone not with a view to immediate publication but merely to puton paper while they are yet fresh in our memories the details of ourjourney and its result which will i believe prove interesting tothe world if ever we determine to make them public</s>  this as at presentadvised we do not intend should be done during our joint lives</s> for the rest it is of no public interest resembling as it does theexperience of more than one central african traveller</s>  suffice it tosay that we did after incredible hardships and privations reach thezambesi which proved to be about a hundred and seventy miles southof where billali left us</s>  there we were for six months imprisoned bya savage tribe who believed us to be supernatural beings chiefly onaccount of leos youthful face and snowwhite hair</s>  from these people weultimately escaped and crossing the zambesi wandered off southwardswhere when on the point of starvation we were sufficiently fortunateto fall in with a halfcast portuguese elephanthunter who had followeda troop of elephants farther inland than he had ever been before</s>  thisman treated us most hospitably and ultimately through his assistancewe after innumerable sufferings and adventures reached delagoa baymore than eighteen months from the time when we emerged from the marshesof kr and the very next day managed to catch one of the steamboatsthat run round the cape to england</s>  our journey home was a prosperousone and we set our foot on the quay at southampton exactly two yearsfrom the date of our departure upon our wild and seemingly ridiculousquest and i now write these last words with leo leaning over myshoulder in my old room in my college the very same into which sometwoandtwenty years ago my poor friend vincey came stumbling on thememorable night of his death bearing the iron chest with him</s> and that is the end of this history so far as it concerns science andthe outside world</s>  what its end will be as regards leo and myself ismore than i can guess at</s>  but we feel that is not reached yet</s>  a storythat began more than two thousand years ago may stretch a long way intothe dim and distant future</s> is leo really a reincarnation of the ancient kallikrates of whom theinscription tells</s>  or was ayesha deceived by some strange hereditaryresemblance</s>  the reader must form his own opinion on this as on manyother matters</s>  i have mine which is that she made no such mistake</s> often i sit alone at night staring with the eyes of the mind into theblackness of unborn time and wondering in what shape and form the greatdrama will be finally developed and where the scene of its next actwill be laid</s>  and when that final development ultimately occurs as ihave no doubt it must and will occur in obedience to a fate that neverswerves and a purpose that cannot be altered what will be the partplayed therein by that beautiful egyptian amenartas the princess of theroyal race of the pharaohs for the love of whom the priest kallikratesbroke his vows to isis and pursued by the inexorable vengeance of theoutraged goddess fled down the coast of libya to meet his doom at kr</s>
