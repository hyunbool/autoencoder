regarded the present war as a true sign ofthe lords approaching return it is not merely because it happens tobe a great war involving the lives of millions of people not merelybecause famine is tightening its grip on every country in europe notmerely because disease of every kind from syphilis to spotted fever isrife among the warring nations no it is not for these reasons that weregard this war as a true sign of the times but because in its originand its progress it is marked by certain characteristics which seemto connect it almost beyond a doubt with the predictions in christianprophecy relating to the second coming of the lord</s> let me enumerate the features of the present war which most clearlysuggest that it is a sign foretelling the near approach of the secondadvent</s>  our lord said that this gospel of the kingdom shall be preachedin all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the endcome</s>  although it would be presumptuous for us to say what degree ofevangelisation will be regarded by god as sufficient we may at leastconfidently hope that a century of unflagging missionary work hasbrought the fulfilment of this condition at any rate near</s>  true thelarger number of the worlds inhabitants have remained deaf to thepreaching of the true religion but that does not vitiate the fact thatthe gospel has been preached for a witness to all unbelievers from thepapist to the zulu</s>  the responsibility for the continued prevalence ofunbelief lies not with the preachers but with those preached to</s> again it has been generally recognised that the drying up of thewaters of the great river euphrates mentioned in the sixteenth chapterof revelation refers to the decay and extinction of turkish power andis a sign of the near approaching end of the world as we know it</s>  thecapture of jerusalem and the successes in mesopotamia are great stridesforward in the destruction of the ottoman empire though it must beadmitted that the gallipoli episode proved that the turk still possessesa notable horn of strength</s>  historically speaking this drying up ofottoman power has been going on for the past century

euphrates orthe decay of turkish power</s>  this fact alone would be enough to connectthe present conflict with the armageddon of revelation and therefore topoint to the near approach of the second advent</s>  but further evidence ofan even more solid and convincing nature can be adduced</s> armageddon is brought about by the activities of three unclean spiritsas it were toads which come out of the mouths of the dragon the beastand the false prophet</s>  if we can identify these three powers of evilmuch light will clearly be thrown on the whole question</s> the dragon the beast and the false prophet can all be identified inhistory</s>  satan who can only work through human agency has used thesethree powers in the long war against christ which has filled the lastnineteen centuries with religious strife</s>  the dragon it has beensufficiently established is pagan rome and the spirit issuing from itsmouth is the spirit of infidelity</s>  the beast alternatively symbolisedas a woman is

devil working in the guise of the lamb and that power isthe socalled society of jesus</s>  the spirit that issues from the mouthof the false prophet is the spirit of false morality</s> we may assume then that the three evil spirits are infidelitypopery and false morality</s>  have these three influences been the realcause of the present conflict</s>  the answer is clear</s> the spirit of infidelity is the very spirit of german criticism</s>  thehigher criticism as it is mockingly called denies the possibility ofmiracles prediction and real inspiration and attempts to account forthe bible as a natural development</s>  slowly but surely during the lasteighty years the spirit of infidelity has been robbing the germansof their bible and their faith so that germany is today a nation ofunbelievers</s>  higher criticism has thus made the war possible for itwould be absolutely impossible for any christian nation to wage war asgermany is waging it</s> we come next to the spirit of popery whose influence in causing thewar was quite as great as that of infidelity though not perhaps soimmediately obvious</s>  since the francoprussian war the papal power hassteadily declined in

of an element so essentially hostile has done much to hamper therighteous cause and is responsible for our comparative illsuccess</s>  thatthe spirit of popery is behind the war is thus seen clearly enough inthe grouping of the opposed powers while the rebellion in the romancatholic parts of ireland has merely confirmed a conclusion alreadyobvious to any unbiased mind</s> the spirit of false morality has played as great a part in this war asthe two other evil spirits</s>  the scrap of paper incident is the nearestand most obvious example of germanys adherence to this

into the estate sir hercules set about remodellinghis household</s>  for though by no means ashamed of his deformityindeedif we may judge from the poem quoted above he regarded himself as beingin many ways superior to the ordinary race of manhe found the presenceof fullgrown men and women embarrassing</s>  realising too that hemust abandon all ambitions in the great world he determined to retireabsolutely from it and to create as it were at crome a privateworld of his own in which all should be proportionable to himself</s> accordingly he discharged all the old servants of the house andreplaced them gradually as he was able to find suitable successorsby others of dwarfish stature</s>  in the course of a few years he hadassembled about himself a numerous household no member of which wasabove four feet high and the smallest among them scarcely two feet andsix inches</s>  his fathers dogs such as setters mastiffs greyhoundsand a pack of beagles he sold or gave away as too large and tooboisterous for his house replacing them by pugs and king charlesspaniels and whatever other breeds of dog were the smallest</s>  hisfathers stable was also sold</s>  for his own use whether riding ordriving he had six black shetland ponies with four very choice piebaldanimals of new forest breed</s> having thus settled his household entirely to his own satisfaction itonly remained for him to find some suitable companion with whom to sharehis paradise</s>  sir hercules had a susceptible heart and had more thanonce between the ages of sixteen and twenty felt what it was to love</s> but here his deformity had been a source of the most bitter humiliationfor having once dared to declare himself to a young lady of his choicehe had been received with laughter</s>  on his persisting she had pickedhim up and shaken him like an importunate child telling him to run awayand plague her no more</s>  the story soon got aboutindeed the young ladyherself used to tell it as a particularly pleasant anecdoteandthe taunts and mockery it occasioned were a source of the most acutedistress to hercules</s>  from the poems written at this period we gatherthat he meditated taking his own life</s>  in course of time however helived down this humiliation but never again though he often fell inlove and that very passionately did he dare to make any advances tothose in whom he was interested</s>  after coming to the estate and findingthat he was in a position to create his own world as he desired it hesaw that if he was to have a wifewhich he very much desired beingof an affectionate and indeed amorous temperhe must choose her ashe had chosen his servantsfrom among the race of dwarfs</s>  but to finda suitable wife was he found a matter of some difficulty for he wouldmarry none who was not distinguished by beauty and gentle birth</s>  thedwarfish daughter of lord bemboro he refused on the ground that besidesbeing a pigmy she was hunchbacked while another young lady an orphanbelonging to a very good family in hampshire was rejected by himbecause her face like that of so many dwarfs was wizened andrepulsive</s>  finally when he was almost despairing of success heheard from a reliable source that count titimalo a venetian noblemanpossessed a daughter of exquisite beauty and great accomplishments whowas by three feet in height</s>  setting out at once for venice he wentimmediately on his arrival to pay his respects to the count whom hefound living with his wife and five children in a very mean apartmentin one of the poorer quarters of the town</s>  indeed the count was so farreduced in his circumstances that he was even then negotiating so itwas rumoured with a travelling company of clowns and acrobats who hadhad the misfortune to lose their performing dwarf for the sale of hisdiminutive daughter filomena</s>  sir hercules arrived in time to save herfrom this untoward fate for he was so much charmed by filomenas graceand beauty that at the end of three days courtship he made her aformal offer of marriage which was accepted by her no less joyfullythan by her father who perceived in an english soninlaw a rich andunfailing source of revenue</s>  after an unostentatious marriage at whichthe english ambassador acted as one of the witnesses sir hercules andhis bride returned by sea to england where they settled down as itproved to a life of uneventful happiness</s> crome and its household of dwarfs delighted filomena who felt herselfnow for the first time to be a free woman living among her equals ina friendly world</s>  she had

husband on his fine cremona fiddle which he playedas we have noted before as one plays a bass viol she would sing allthe liveliest and tenderest airs from the operas and cantatas of hernative country</s>  seated together at the harpsichord they found that theycould with their four hands play all the music written for two handsof ordinary size a circumstance which gave sir hercules unfailingpleasure</s> when they were not making music or reading together which they oftendid both in english and italian they spent their time in healthfuloutdoor exercises sometimes rowing in a little boat on the lake butmore often riding or driving occupations in which because they wereentirely new to her filomena especially delighted</s>  when she had becomea perfectly proficient rider filomena and her husband used often to gohunting in the park at that time very much more extensive than it isnow</s>  they hunted not foxes nor hares but rabbits using a pack ofabout thirty black and fawncoloured pugs a kind of dog which when notoverfed can course a rabbit as well as any of the smaller breeds</s>  fourdwarf grooms dressed in scarlet liveries and mounted on white exmoorponies hunted the pack while their master and mistress in greenhabits followed either on the black shetlands or on the piebald newforest ponies</s>  a picture of the whole huntdogs horses grooms andmasterswas painted by william stubbs whose work sir hercules admiredso much that he invited him though a man of ordinary stature to comeand stay at the mansion for the purpose of executing this picture</s> stubbs likewise painted a portrait of sir hercules and his lady drivingin their green enamelled calash drawn by four black shetlands</s>  sirhercules wears a plumcoloured velvet coat and white breeches filomenais dressed in flowered muslin and a very large hat with pink feathers</s> the two figures in their gay carriage stand out sharply against a darkbackground of trees but to the

sun</s> in this way four years passed happily by</s>  at the end of that timefilomena found herself great with child</s>  sir hercules was overjoyed</s> if god is good he wrote in his daybook the name
