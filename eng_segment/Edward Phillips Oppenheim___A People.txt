drinks being served and culvainwith a notebook upon his knee ostentatiously sharpened a pencil</s>  itwas very much like a meeting of a parish council</s>  ross alone amongstthe delegates had the absorbed air of a man on the threshold of greatthings and aaron from his seat behind maraton watched his master allthe time with strained and passionate attention</s> in the first place peter dale began weve no wish to commence thismeeting with any unpleasantness</s>  at the same time mr</s>  maraton we didthink that after that letter of ours youd have seen your way clear tocome up to london

away</s> to tell you the truth maraton replied calmly i did not see thefaintest reason why i should shorten my visit to mr</s>  foley</s>  we hadarranged to meet here today and that seemed to me to be quitesufficient</s> peter dale tugged at his beard for a moment</s> i am not wishful he reiterated to commence a discussion which mightlead to disagreement between us</s>  well drop the matter for the

get on with it</s> this being mainly my show john henneford declared ill come and sitat your right hand mr</s>  maraton</s>  youve got all the papers ive sentyou about the cotton workers</s> i have looked them through maraton replied but most of theircontents were familiar to me</s>  i made a study of the condition of allyour industries so far as i could last year</s> between you and me peter

struck the table with his fist</s> rot</s>  he exclaimed</s>  your miners have just had a turn</s>  halfacrown aweek extra and a minimum wagewhat more do you want</s>  and a piece ofplate and a nice

secretary ofthe manchester labour party will be here</s>  hes got two demand scalesmade out for you to look through</s>  your job is to work the people up sothat they drop their tools next saturday night</s> there was an idea maraton reminded them quietly that i should speaktonight not only to the operatives of manchester but to labourthroughout the empire that i should make a pronouncement which shouldhave in it something of a common basis for all industrieswhich wouldin short unsettle labour in every great centre</s> they all looked a little blank</s>  henneford shook his head</s> it cant be done he affirmed</s>  one job at a times our way</s>  youregoing to speak to cotton tonight and we want the mills emptied by theend of the week</s>  weve got a scheme amongst the unions as you

dale proposed rapping on the table</s>  now listenhere all of you</s>  what i propose is if were satisfied with mr</s> maratons address tonight as ive no doubt we shall be he addedbowing to maraton with clumsy politeness that we appoint him kind oflecturer to the unions and we make out a sort of itinerary for him tokind of pave the way and then he gives one of these chicago orations ofhis at the last moment in each of the principal centres</s>  wed fix asalaryno need to be mean about itand get to work as soon as thisaffairs over</s>  and meanwhile while this strikes on mr</s>  maratonmight address a few meetings in other centres on behalf of thesefellows and rope in some coin</s>  there are one or two matters we shallhave to have an understanding about however and one as had better

didnt findwhat you said altogether helpful or particularly lucid</s>  now whats thisbusiness about a universal strike</s> maraton sat for a moment almost silent</s>  he looked down the table alongthe

only you see itsa piecemeal sort of business to call yourselves the representatives oflabour in its broadest sense</s>  i belong more i am afraid to the schoolof theorists</s>  in my mind i bring all labour together all the toilersof the world who are slaves to the great moloch capital</s>  you have animmense middle class here in england who are living in fatness andcontent</s>  the keynote of my creed is that these people have twice theincomes they ought to have and labour half as much</s>  that of courseis just the simple oldfashioned illogical socialism with which youprobably all started

pull down the pillars which hold up the greatness of this nation ibelieve that if we were to lay her in ruins about us that in the yearsto comeperhaps i ought to say the generations to comethe rebuildingstone by stone would be on the sane principle which once establishedwould last for eternity of an absolute partnership between capital andlabour a partnership which i say would be eternal

meant to preachtonight</s>  if your coal strike and your iron strike and your railwaystrike were declared within the next few days the pillars would indeedbe pulled down</s> why i should say so</s>  peter dale declared gruffly</s>  half the peoplein the country would be starving thered be no subscriptions to theunions the blooming germans would be over here in no time and weshould lose our

muttered thats right</s>  send him away the only onewho sees the truth</s>  send him away</s>  its dangerous you might lose yourjobs</s> then maraton spoke quietly from his place</s> gentlemen he said

too had become a particularist</s>  hetoo was content to preach salvation piecemeal</s>  he had spoken to themat first simply as one worker to another</s>  then he had drifted out intothe larger sea

success of it</s> it was long before they let him leave the platform</s>  in the droningimpotence of the men who followed him the vast audience seemed torealise once more the splendid perfection of

us</s>  graveling demanded</s>  arent we for the people</s> isnt that what were in parliament for</s>  isnt that why we are calledlabour members</s> maraton regarded the last speaker steadily</s> mr</s>  graveling he said since you have mooted the question i willadmit that i do not consider you as a body of men entirely devoted tothe cause of the people</s>  you are each devoted to your own

more universal truths</s>  i maybe wrong</s>  that is how the matter seems to me</s> then since youre so frank peter dale declared with undiminishedwrath ill just imitate your candour</s>  ill tell you how you seem tous</s>  you seem like a man with a gift whose head has been turned by mr</s> foley and his fine friends</s>  youre full of great phrases but theresnothing practical about them or
