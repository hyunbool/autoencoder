sonnets from the portuguesei</s>  i thought once how theocritus had sung of the sweet years the dear and wishedfor years who each one in a gracious hand appears to bear a gift for mortals old or young and as i mused it in his antique tongue i saw in gradual vision through my tears the sweet sad years the melancholy years those of my own life who by turns had flung a shadow across me</s>

lifted in its turn by a beating heart at dancetime</s>  hopes apace were changed to long despairs till gods own grace could scarcely lift above the world forlorn my heavy heart</s>  then thou didst bid me bring and let it drop adown thy calmly great deep being</s>  fast it sinketh as a thing which its own nature doth precipitate while thine doth close above it mediating betwixt the stars and the unaccomplished fate</s> xxvi</s>  i lived with visions for my company instead of men and women years ago and found them gentle mates nor thought to know a sweeter music than they played to me</s>  but
