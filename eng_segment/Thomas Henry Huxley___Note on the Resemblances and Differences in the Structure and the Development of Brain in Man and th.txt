again as respects the question of absolute size it is establishedthat the difference between the largest and the smallest healthy humanbrain is greater than the difference between the smallest healthy humanbrain and the largest chimpanzees or orangs brain</s> moreover there is one circumstance in which the orangs andchimpanzees brains resemble mans but in which they differ from thelower apes and that is the presence of two corpora candicantiathecynomorpha having but one</s> in view of these facts i do not hesitate in this year 1874 to repeatand insist upon the proposition which i enunciated in 1863 74</s> mans place in nature p</s>  102</s> so far as cerebral structure goes therefore it is clear that mandiffers less from the chimpanzee or the orang than these do even fromthe monkeys and that the difference between the brain of thechimpanzee and of man is almost insignificant when compared with thatbetween the chimpanzee brain and that of a lemur</s> in the paper to which i have referred professor bischoff does not denythe second part of this statement but he first makes the irrelevantremark that it is not wonderful if the brains of an orang and a lemurare very different and secondly goes on to assert that if wesuccessively compare the brain of a man with that of an orang thebrain of this with that of a chimpanzee of this with that of agorilla and so on of a hylobates semnopithecus cynocephaluscercopithecus macacus cebus callithrix lemur stenops hapale weshall not meet with a greater or even as great a break in the degreeof development of the convolutions as we find between the brain of aman and that of an orang or chimpanzee</s> to which i reply firstly that whether this assertion be true orfalse it has nothing whatever to do with the proposition enunciated inmans place in nature which refers not to the development of theconvolutions alone but to the structure of the whole brain</s>  ifprofessor bischoff had taken the trouble to refer to p</s>  96 of the workhe criticises in fact he would have found the following passageand it is a remarkable circumstance that though so far as our presentknowledge extends there is one true structural break in the series offorms of simian brains this hiatus does not lie between man and themanlike apes but between the lower and the lowest simians or in otherwords between the old and new world apes and monkeys and the lemurs</s> every lemur which has yet been examined in fact has its cerebellumpartially visible from above and its posterior lobe with thecontained posterior cornu and hippocampus minor more or lessrudimentary</s>  every marmoset american monkey old world monkey baboonor manlike ape on the contrary has its cerebellum entirely hiddenposteriorly by the cerebral lobes and possesses a large posteriorcornu with a welldeveloped hippocampus minor</s> this statement was a strictly accurate account of what was known whenit was made and it does not appear to me to be more than apparentlyweakened by the subsequent discovery of the relatively smalldevelopment of the posterior lobes in the siamang and in the howlingmonkey</s>  notwithstanding the exceptional brevity of the posterior lobesin these two species no one will pretend that their brains in theslightest degree approach those of the lemurs</s>  and if instead ofputting hapale out of its natural place as professor bischoff mostunaccountably does we write the series of animals he has chosen tomention as follows homo pithecus troglodytes hylobatessemnopithecus cynocephalus cercopithecus macacus cebus callithrixhapale lemur stenops i venture to reaffirm that the great break inthis series lies between hapale and lemur and that this break isconsiderably greater than that between any other two terms of thatseries</s>  professor bischoff ignores the fact that long before he wrotegratiolet had suggested the separation of the lemurs from the otherprimates on the very ground of the difference in their cerebralcharacters and that professor flower had made the followingobservations in the course of his description of the brain of the javanloris 75</s>

but it is important to remark that whether gratiolet was right orwrong in his hypothesis respecting the relative order of appearance ofthe temporal and frontal sulci the fact remains that before eithertemporal or frontal sulci appear the foetal brain of man presentscharacters which are found only in the lowest group of the primatesleaving out the lemurs and that this is exactly what we shouldexpect to be the case if man has resulted from the gradualmodification of the same form as that from which the other primateshave sprung</s> </s>
