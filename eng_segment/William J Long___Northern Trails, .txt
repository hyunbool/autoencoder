northern trailsbook ibywilliam j</s>  longwood folk series book vi1905prefacein the original preface to northern trails the author stated thatwith the solitary exception of the salmons life in the sea after hevanishes from human sight every incident recorded here is foundedsquarely upon personal and accurate observation of animal life andhabits</s>  i now repeat and emphasize that statement</s>  even when theobservations are for the readers sake put into the form of aconnected story there is not one trait or habit mentioned which is nottrue to animal life</s> such a statement ought to be enough especially as i have repeatedlyfurnished evidence from reliable eyewitnesses to support everyobservation that the critics have challenged but of late a strenuouspublic attack has been made upon the wolf story in this volume by twomen claiming to speak with authority</s>  they take radical exception to myrecord of a big white wolf killing a young caribou by snapping at thechest and heart</s>  they declared this method of killing to be amathematical impossibility and by inference a gross falsehoodutterly ruinous to true ideas of wolves and of natural history</s> as no facts or proofs are given to support this charge the first thingwhich a sensible man naturally does is to examine the fitness of thecritics in order to ascertain upon what knowledge or experience theybase their dogmatic statements</s>  one of these critics is a man who has nopersonal knowledge of wolves or caribou who asserts that the animal hasno possibility of reason or intelligence and who has for years publiclydenied the observations of other men which tend to disprove his ancienttheory</s>  it seems hardly worth while to argue about either wolves or menwith such a naturalist or to point out that descartes idea of animalsas purely mechanical or automatic creatures has long since been laidaside and was never considered seriously by any man who had lived closeto either wild or domestic animals</s>  the second critics knowledge ofwolves consists almost entirely of what he has happened to see whenchasing the creatures with dogs and hunters</s>  judging by his own naturebooks with their barbaric records of slaughter his experience of wildanimals was gained while killing them</s>  such a man will undoubtedlydiscover some things about animals how they fight and hide and escapetheir human enemies but it hardly needs any argument to show that theman who goes into the woods with dogs and rifles and the desire to killcan never understand any living animal</s> if you examine now any of the little books which he condemns you willfind a totally different story no record of chasing and killing butonly of patient watching of creeping near to wild animals and winningtheir confidence whenever it is possible of following them day andnight with no motive but the pure love of the thing and no object but tosee exactly what each animal is doing and to understand so far as a mancan the mystery of its dumb life</s> naturally a man in this attitude will see many traits of animal lifewhich are hidden from the gamekiller as well as from the scientificcollector of skins</s>  for instance practically all wild animals are shyand timid and run away at mans approach</s>  this is the general experiencenot only of hunters but of casual observers in the woods</s>  yet my ownexperience has many times shown me exactly the opposite trait that whenthese same shy animals find me unexpectedly close at hand more thanhalf the time they show no fear whatever but only an eager curiosity toknow who and what the creature is that sits so quietly near them</s> sometimes indeed they seem almost to understand the mental attitudewhich has no thought of harm but only of sympathy and friendly interest</s> once i was followed for hours by a young wolf which acted precisely likea lost dog too timid to approach and too curious or lonely to run away</s> he even wagged his tail when i called to him softly</s>  had i shot him onsight i would probably have foolishly believed that he intended toattack me when he came trotting along my trail</s>  three separate times ihave touched a wild deer with my hand once i touched a moose once aneagle once a bear and a score of times at least i have had to frightenthese big animals or get out of their way when their curiosity broughtthem too near for perfect comfort</s> so much for the personal element for the general attitude and fitnessof the observer and his critics</s>  but the question is not chiefly apersonal one it is simply a matter of truth and observation and theonly honest or scientific method is first to go straight to nature andfind out the facts and thenlest your own eyesight or judgment be atfaultto consult other observers to find if perchance they also haveseen the facts exemplified</s>  this is not so easy as to dogmatize or towrite animal stories but it is the only safe method and one which thenature writer as well as the scientist must follow if his work is toendure</s> following this good method when the critics had proclaimed that myrecord of a big wolf killing a young caribou by biting into the chestand heart was an impossibility i went straight to the big woods and assoon as the law allowed secured photographs and exact measurements ofthe first fullgrown deer that crossed my trail</s>  these photographs andmeasurements show beyond any possibility of honest doubt the followingfacts 1 the lower chest of a deer between and just behind theforelegs is thin and wedgeshaped exactly as i stated and the pointof the heart is well down in this narrow wedge</s>  the distance through thechest and point of the heart from side to side was in this caseexactly four and onehalf inches</s>  a mans hand as shown in thephotograph can easily grasp the whole lower chest of a deer placingthumb and forefinger over the heart on opposite sides</s>  2 the heart ofa deer and indeed of all ruminant animals lies close against the chestwalls and is easily reached and wounded</s>  the chest cartilage except inan old deer is soft the ribs are thin and easily crushed and thespaces between the ribs are wide enough to admit a mans finger to saynothing of a wolfs fang</s>
 in this case the point of the heart as thedeer lay on his side was barely five eights of an inch from thesurface</s>  3 any dog or wolf therefore having a spread of jaws of fourand onehalf inches and fangs three quarters of an inch long couldeasily grasp the chest of this deer from beneath and reach the heartfrom either side</s>  as the jaws of the big northern wolf spread from sixto eight inches and his fangs are over an inch long to kill a deer inthis way would require but a slight effort</s>
 the chest of a caribou isanatomically exactly like that of other deer only the caribou fawn andyearling of northern trails have smaller chests than the animals imeasured</s> so much for the facts and the possibilities</s>  as for specific instancesyears ago i found a deer just killed in the snow and beside him thefresh tracks of a big wolf which had probably been frightened away atmy approach</s>  the deer was bitten just behind and beneath the leftshoulder and one long fang had entered the heart</s>  there was not anotherscratch on the body so far as i could discover</s>  i thought this veryexceptional at the time but years afterwards my indian guide in theinterior of newfoundland assured me that it was a common habit ofkilling caribou among the big white wolves with which he was familiar</s> to show that the peculiar habit is not confined to any one section iquote here from the sworn statements of three other eyewitnesses</s>  thefirst is superintendent of the algonquin national park a man who hasspent a lifetime in the north woods and who has at present an excellentopportunity for observing wildanimal habits the second is an educatedsioux indian the third is a geologist and mining engineer nowpracticing his profession in philadelphia</s> algonquin park ontario august 31 1907</s> this certifies that during the past thirty years spent in our canadianwilds i have seen several animals killed by our large timber wolves</s>  inthe winter of 1903 i saw two deer thus killed on smoke lake nipissingontario</s>  one deer was bitten through the front chest the other justbehind the foreleg</s>  in each case there was no other wound on the body</s> signed g</s> w</s>  bartlett superintendent</s> i certify that i lived for twenty years in northern nebraska and dakotain a region where timber wolves were abundant</s> </s> </s> </s>  i saw one horse thathad just been killed by a wolf</s>  the front of his chest was torn open tothe heart</s>  there was no other wound on the body</s>  i once watched a wolfkill a stray horse on the open prairie</s>  he kept nipping at the hindlegs making the horse turn rapidly till he grew dizzy and fell down</s> then the wolf snapped or bit into his chest</s> </s> </s> </s>  the horse died in a fewmoments</s> signed stephen jones hepidan</s> i certify that in november 1900 while surveying in wyoming my partysaw two wolves chase a twoyearold colt over a cliff some fifteen orsixteen feet high</s>  i was on the spot with two others immediately afterthe incident occurred</s>  the only injuries to the colt aside from abroken leg were deep lacerations made by wolf fangs in the chest behindthe foreshoulder</s>  in addition to this personal observation i havefrequently heard from hunters herders and cowboys that big wolvesfrequently kill deer and other animals by snapping at the chest</s> signed f</s> s</s>  pusey</s> i have more evidence of the same kind from the region which i describedin northern trails but i give these three simply to show that whatone man discovers as a surprising trait of some individual wolf or deermay be common enough when we open our eyes to see</s>  the fact that wolvesdo not always or often kill in this way has nothing to do with thequestion</s>  i know one small region where old wolves generally hunt inpairs and so far as i can discover one wolf always trips or throws thegame while the other invariably does the killing at the throat</s>  inanother region including a part of algonquin park in ontario i havethe records of several deer killed by wolves in a single winter and inevery case the wolf slipped up behind his game and cut the femoralartery or the inner side of the hind leg and then drew back quietlyallowing the deer to bleed to death</s> the point is that because a thing is unusual or interesting it is notnecessarily false as my dogmatic critics would have you believe</s>  i havestudied animals not as species but as individuals and have recordedsome things which other and better naturalists have overlooked but ihave sought for facts first of all as zealously as any biologist andhave recorded only what i have every reason to believe is true</s>  thatthese facts are unusual means simply that we have at last found naturalhistory to be interesting just as the discovery of unusual men andincidents gives charm and meaning to the records of our humanity</s>  theremay be honest errors or mistakes in these booksand no one tries halfso hard as the author to find and correct thembut meanwhile the factremains that though six volumes of the wood folk books have alreadybeen published only three slight errors have thus far been pointed outand these were promptly and gratefully acknowledged</s>
the simple truth is that these observations of mine though they are alltrue do not tell more than a small fraction of the interesting thingsthat wild animals do continually in their native state when they arenot frightened by dogs and hunters or when we are not blinded by ourpreconceived notions in watching them</s>  i have no doubt that romancing isrife just now on the part of men who study animals in a library butpersonally with my notebooks full of incidents which i have never yetrecorded i find the truth more interesting and i cannot understand whya man should deliberately choose romance when he can have the greaterjoy of going into the wilderness to see with his own eyes and tounderstand with his own heart just how the animals live</s>  one thing seemsto me to be more and more certain that we are only just beginning tounderstand wild animals and it is chiefly our own barbarism our lustof killing our stupid stuffed specimens and especially our prejudiceswhich stand in the way of greater knowledge</s>  meanwhile the critic whoasserts dogmatically what a wild animal will or will not do undercertain conditions only proves how carelessly he has watched them andhow little he has learned of natures infinite variety</s> william j</s>  longstamford connecticutcontentswayeeses the strong onethe old wolfs challengewhere the trail beginsnoel and mookathe way of the

a moment before the hillside had appeared utterly lifeless so still andrugged and desolate that one must notice and welcome the stir of a mouseor ground squirrel in the moss speaking of life that is glad and freeand vigorous even in the deepest solitudes yet now so quietly did theold wolf appear so perfectly did her rough gray coat blend with therough gray rocks that the hillside seemed just as tenantless as before</s> a stray wind seemed to move the mosses that was all</s>  only where themountains once slept now they seemed wideawake</s>  keen eyes saw everymoving thing from the bees in the bluebells to the slow fishingboatsfar out at sea sharp ears that were cocked like a collies heard everychirp and trill and rustle and a nose that understood everything washolding up every vagrant breeze and searching it for its message</s>  forthe cubs were coming out for the first time to play in the big worldand no wild mother ever lets that happen without first taking infiniteprecautions that her little ones be not molested nor made afraid</s> a faint breeze from the west strayed over the mountains and instantlythe old wolf turned her sensitive nose to question it</s>  there on herright and just across a deep ravine where a torrent went leaping downto the sea in hundredfoot jumps a great stag caribou was standingstill as a stone on a lofty pinnacle looking down over the marvelouspanorama spread wide beneath his feet</s>  every day megaleep came there tolook and the old wolf in her daily hunts often crossed the deep pathwhich he had worn through the moss from the wide tablelands over theridge to this sightly place where he could look down curiously at thecomings and goings of men on the sea</s>  but at this season when small gamewas abundantand indeed at all seasons when not hungerdriventhe wolfwas peaceable and the caribou were not molested</s>  indeed the big stagknew well where the old wolf denned</s>  every east wind brought her messageto his nostrils but secure in his own strength and in the general peacewhich prevails in the summertime among all large animals of the northhe came daily to look down on the harbor and wag his ears at thefishingboats which he could never understand</s> strange neighbors these the grim savage mother wolf of the mountainshiding her young in dens of the rocks and the wary magnificentwanderer of the broad caribou barrens but they understood each otherand neither wolf nor caribou had any fear or hostile intent one for theother</s>  and this is not strange at all as might be supposed by those whothink animals are governed by fear on one hand and savage cruelty on theother but is one of the commonest things to be found by those whofollow faithfully the northern trails</s> wayeeses had chosen her den well on the edge of the untroddensolitudessixty miles as the crow fliesthat stretch northward fromharbor weal to harbor woe</s>  it was just under the ridge in a sunnyhollow among the rocks on the southern slope of the great mountains</s> the earliest sunshine found the place and warmed it bringing forth thebluebells for a carpet while in every dark hollow the snow lingered allsummer long making dazzling white patches on the mountain and underthe high waterfalls that looked from the harbor like bits of silverribbon stretched over the green woods the ice clung to the rocks infantastic knobs and gargoyles making cold deep pools for the trout toplay in</s>  so it was both cool and warm there and whatever the weatherthe gaunt old mother wolf could always find just the right spot to sleepaway the afternoon</s>  best of all it was perfectly safe for though fromthe door of her den she could look down on the old indians cabin likea pebble on the shore so steep were the billowing hills and soimpassable the ravines that no human foot ever trod the place not evenin autumn when the fishermen left their boats at anchor in harbor wealand camped inland on the paths of the big caribou herds</s> whether or not the father wolf ever knew where his cubs were hidden onlyhe himself could tell</s>  he was an enormous brute powerful and cunningbeyond measure that haunted the lonely thickets and ponds bordering thegreat caribou barrens over the ridge and that kept a silent watchwithin howling distance over the den which he never saw</s>  sometimes themother wolf met him on her wanderings and they hunted together</s>  often hebrought the game he had caught a fox or a young goose and sometimeswhen she had hunted in vain he met her as if he had understood her needfrom a distance and led her to where he had buried two or three of therabbits that swarmed in the thickets</s>  but spite of the attention and theindifferent watch which he kept he never ventured near the den whichhe could have found easily enough by following the mothers track</s>  theold shewolf would have flown at his throat like a fury had he showedhis head over the top of the ridge</s> the reason for this was simple enough to the savage old mother thoughthere are some things about it that men do not yet understand</s>  wolveslike cats and foxes and indeed like most wild male animals have anatrocious way of killing their own young when they find themunprotected so the mother animal searches out a den by herself andrarely allows the male to come near it</s>  spite of this beastly habit itmust be said honestly of the old hewolf that he shows a marvelousgentleness towards his mate</s>  he runs at the slightest show of teeth froma mother wolf half his size and will stand meekly a snap of the jaws ora cruel gash of the terrible fangs in his flank without defendinghimself</s>  even our hounds seem to have inherited something of thisprimitive wolf trait for there are seasons when unless urged on bymen they will not trouble a mother wolf or fox</s>  many times in theearly spring when foxes are mating and again later when they are heavywith young and incapable of a hard run i have caught my hounds trottingmeekly after a mother fox sniffing her trail indifferently and sittingdown with heads turned aside when she stops for a moment to watch andyap at them disdainfully</s>  and when you call them they come shamefacedthough in wintertime when running the same fox to death they pay nomore heed to your call than to the crows clamoring over them</s>  but wemust return to wayeeses sitting over her den on a great gray rocktrying every breeze searching every movement harking to every chirpand rustle before bringing her cubs out into the world</s> satisfied at last with her silent investigation she turned her headtowards the den</s>  there was no sound only one of those silent unknowncommunications that pass between animals</s>  instantly there was ascratching scurrying whining and three cubs tumbled out of the darkhole in the rocks with fuzzy yellow fur and bright eyes and sharp earsand noses like collies all blinking and wondering and suddenly silentat the big bright world which they had never seen before so differentfrom the dark den under the rocks</s> indeed it was a marvelous world that the little cubs looked upon whenthey came out to blink and wonder in the june sunshine</s>  contrastseverywhere that made the world seem too big for one little glance tocomprehend it all</s>  here the sunlight streamed and danced and quivered onthe warm rocks there deep purple cloud shadows rested for hours as ifasleep or swept over the mountain side in an endless game offoxandgeese with the sunbeams</s>  here the birds trilled the bees hummedin the bluebells the brook roared and sang on its way to the sea whileover all the harmony of the world brooded a silence too great to bedisturbed</s>
 sunlight and shadow snow and ice gloomy ravines anddazzling mountain tops mayflowers and singing birds and rustling windsfilled all the earth with color and movement and melody</s>  from undertheir very feet great masses of rock tossed and tumbled as by a giantsplay stretched downwards to where the green woods began and rolled invast billows to the harbor which shone and sparkled in the sun yetseemed no bigger than their mothers paw</s>
 fishingboats with shiningsails hovered over it like dragonflies going and coming from thelittle houses that sheltered together under the opposite mountain likea cluster of gray toadstools by a towering pine stump</s>  most wonderfulmost interesting of all was the little gray hut on the shore almostunder their feet where little noel and the indian children played withthe tide like fiddler crabs or pushed bravely out to meet the fishermenin a bobbing nutshell</s>  for wolf cubs are like collies in this that theyseem to have a natural interest perhaps a natural kinship with man andnext to their own kind nothing arouses their interest like a group ofchildren playing</s> so the little cubs took their first glimpse of the big world ofmountains and sea and sunshine and children playing on the shore andthe world was altogether too wonderful for little heads to comprehend</s> nevertheless one plain impression remained the same that you see in theears and nose and stumbling feet and wagging tail of every puppydog youmeet on the streets that this bright world is a famous place just madeapurpose for little ones to play in</s>  sitting on their tails in a solemnrow the wolf cubs bent their heads and pointed their noses gravely atthe sea</s>  there it was all silver and blue and boundless with tinywhite sails dancing over it winking and flashing like entangled bits ofsunshine and since the eyes of a cub like those of a little childcannot judge distances one stretched a paw at the nearest sail milesaway to turn it over and make it go the other way</s>  they turned up theirheads sidewise and blinked at the sky all blue and calm and infinitewith white clouds sailing over it like swans on a limpid lake and onestood up on his hind legs and reached up both paws like a kitten topull down a cloud to play with</s>  then the wind stirred a feather nearthem the white feather of a ptarmigan which they had eaten yesterdayand forgetting the big world and the sail and the cloud the cubs tookto playing with the feather chasing and worrying and tumbling over eachother while the gaunt old mother wolf looked down from her rock andwatched and was satisfied</s> noel and mookadown on the shore that same bright june afternoon little noel and hissister mooka were going on wonderful sledge journeys meeting wolves andpolar bears and caribou and all sorts of adventures more wonderful byfar than any that ever came to imagination astride of a rockinghorse</s> they had a rare team of dogs caesar and wolf and grouch and therestfive or six uneasy crabs which they had

goats from rock to rock</s>  in an hour they were far up the mountainlying side by side on a great flat rock looking across a deepimpassable valley and over two rounded hilltops where the scrub

been watching</s>  swiftly silently she followedtheir steps found the old trails coming up and the fresh trailsreturning then sure at last that no danger threatened her own littleones she loped away up the hill and over the topmost ridge to thecaribou barrens and the thickets where young rabbits were alreadystirring about in the twilight</s> that night in the cabin under the cliffs old tomah had to rehearseagain all the wolf lore learned in sixty years of hunting howfortunately for the deer these enormous wolves had never been abundantand were now very rare a few having been shot and more poisoned in thestarving times and the rest having vanished mysteriously as wolves dofor some unknown reason</s>  bears which are easily trapped and shot andwhose skins are worth each a months wages to the fishermen still holdtheir own and even increase on the great island while the wolves oncemore numerous are slowly vanishing though they are never hunted andnot even old tomah himself could set a trap cunningly enough to catchone</s>  the old hunter told while mooka and noel held their breaths anddrew closer to the light how once when he made his camp alone under acliff on the lake shore seven huge wolves white as the snow cameracing swift and silent over the ice straight at the fire which he hadbarely time to kindle how he shot two and the others seizing the fishhe had just caught through the ice for his own supper vanished over thebank and he could not say even now whether they meant him harm or no</s> again as he talked and the grim old face lighted up at the memory theysaw him crouched with his sledgedogs by a blazing fire all the longwinter night and around him in the darkness blazing points of lightthe eyes of wolves flashing back the firelight and gaunt white formsflitting about like shadows drawing nearer and nearer with evergrowingboldness till they seized his largest dogthough the brute lay so nearthe fire that his hair singedand whisked it away with an appallingoutcry</s>  and still again when tomah was lost three days in the interiorthey saw him wandering with his pack over endless barrens and throughgloomy spruce woods and near him all the time a young wolf thatfollowed his steps quietly with halffriendly interest and came nonearer day or night</s> all these things and many more the children heard from old tomah andamong all his hunting experiences and the stories and legends which hetold them there was not one to make them afraid</s>  for the horrible storyof red riding hood is not known among the indians who know well howuntrue the tale is to wolf nature and how foolish it is to frightenchildren with false stories of wolves and bears misrepresenting them assavage and bloodthirsty brutes when in truth they are but shypeaceloving animals whose only motive toward man except when crazedby wounds or hunger is one of childish curiosity</s>  all these ferociousanimal stories have their origin in other centuries and in distantlands where they may possibly have been true but more probably arejust as false to animal nature for they seem to reflect not the shyanimal that men glimpsed in the woods but rather the boastings of somehunter who always magnifies his own praise by increasing the ferocityof the game he has killed or else the pure imagination of some ancientnurse who tried to increase her scant authority by frightening herchildren with terrible tales</s>  here certainly the indian attitude ofkinship gained by long centuries of living near to the animals andwatching them closely comes nearer to the truth of things</s>  that is whylittle mooka and noel could listen for hours to old tomahs animalstories and then go away to bed and happy dreams longing for the lightso that they might be off again to watch at the wolfs den</s> one thing only disturbed them for a moment</s>  even these children had wolfmemories and vied with old tomah in eagerness of telling</s>  theyremembered one fearful winter years ago when most of the families ofthe little fishing village on the east harbor had moved far inland tosheltered cabins in the deep woods to escape the cold and the fearfulblizzards of the coast</s>  one still moonlit night when the snow lay deepand the cold was intense and all the trees were cracking like pistols inthe frost a mournful howling rose all around their little cabin</s>  lightfootfalls sounded on the crust there were scratchings at the very doorand hoarse breathings at every crack while the dogs with hackles upstraight and stiff on their necks fled howling under beds and tables</s> and when mooka and noel went fearfully with their mother to the littlewindowfor the men were far away on a caribou huntthere were gauntwhite wolves five or six of them flitting restlessly about in themoonlight scratching at the cracks and even raising themselves on theirhind legs to look in at the little windows</s> mooka shivered a bit when she remembered the uncanny scene and feltagain the strong pressure of her mothers arms holding her close butold tomah brushed away her fears with a smile and a word as he hadalways done when as little children they had showed fear at thethunder or the gale or the cry of a wild beast in the night till theyhad grown to look upon all natures phenomena as hiding a smile askindly as that of old tomah himself who had a face wrinkled andterribly grim to be sure but who could smile and tell a story so thatevery child trusted him</s>  the wolves were hungry starving hungry hesaid and wanted only a dog or one of the pigs</s>  and mooka rememberedwith a bright laugh the two unruly pigs that had been taken inland as ahostage to famine and that must be carefully guarded from the teeth ofhungry prowlers for they would soon be needed to keep the childrenthemselves from starving</s>  every night at early sunset when the treesbegan to groan and the keen winds from the mountains came whisperingthrough the woods the two pigs were taken into the snug kitchen wherewith the dogs they slept so close to the stove that she could alwayssmell pork afrying</s>  not a husky dog there but would have killed andeaten one of these little pigs if he could have caught him around thecorner of the house after nightfall though you would never havesuspected it if you had seen them so close together keeping each otherwarm after the fire went out</s>  and besides the dogs and the wolves therewere lynxesbig roundheaded savagelooking creaturesthat cameprowling out of the deep woods every night hungry for a taste of thelittle pigs and now and then an enormous polar bear that had landedfrom an iceberg would shuffle swiftly and fearlessly among the handfulof little cabins leaving his great footprints in every yard and tearingto pieces as if made of straw the heavy log pens to which some of thefishermen had foolishly confided their pigs or sheep</s>  he even enteredthe woodsheds and rummaged about after a stray fishbone or an oldsealskin boot making a great rowdydow in the still night and only thesmell of man or the report of an old gun fired at him by some bravewoman out of the halfopen window kept him from pushing his enormousweight against the very doors of the cabins</s> thinking of all these things mooka forgot her fears of the whitewolves remembering with a kind of sympathy how hungry all these shyprowlers must be to leave their own haunts whence the rabbits and sealshad vanished and venture boldly into the yards of men</s>  as for noel heremembered with regret that he was too small at the time to use the longbow which he now carried on his rabbit and goose hunts and as he tookit from the wall thrumming its chord of caribou sinew and fingering thesharp edge of a long arrow he was hoping for just such another winterlonging to try his skill and strength on some of these midnightprowlersa lynx perhaps not to begin too largely on a polar bear</s>  sothere was no fear at all but only an eager wonder when they followedup the brook next day to watch at the wolfs den</s>  and even when noelfound a track a light oval track larger but more slender than a dogsin some moist sand close beside their own footprints and evidentlyfollowing them they remembered only the young wolf that had followedtomah and pressed on the more eagerly</s> day after day they returned to their watchtower on the flat rock underthe dwarf spruce at the head of the brook and lying there side by sidethey watched the play of the young wolf cubs</s>  every day they grew moreinterested as the spirit of play entered into themselves understandingthe gladness of the wild roughandtumble when one of the cubs lay inwait for another and leaped upon him from ambush understanding alsosomething of the feeling of the gaunt old shewolf as she looked downgravely from her gray rock watching her growing youngsters</s>  once theybrought an old spyglass which they had borrowed from a fisherman andthrough its seadimmed lenses they made out that one of the cubs waslarger than the other two with a droop at the tip of his right earlike a pointed leaf that has been creased sharply between the fingers</s> mooka claimed that wolf instantly for her own as if they were watchingthe husky puppies and by his broken ear said she should know him againwhen he grew to be a big wolf if he should ever follow her as hisfather perhaps had followed old tomah but noel thinking of his bow andhis long arrow with the sharp point thought of the winter night longago and hoped that his two wolves would know enough to keep away whenthe pack came again for he did not see any way to recognize and sparethem especially in the moonlight</s>  so they lay there making plans anddreaming dreams gentle or savage for the little cubs that played withthe feathers and grasshoppers and cloud shadows all unconscious thatany eyes but their mothers saw or cared for their wild free playing</s> illustration watching her growing youngsterssomething bothered the old shewolf in these days of watching</s>  the denwas still secure for no human foot had crossed the deep ravine orventured nearer than the opposite hilltop</s>  her nose told her thatunmistakably but still she was uneasy and whenever the cubs wereplaying she felt without knowing why that she was being watched</s>  whenshe trailed over all the ridges in the twilight seeking to know ifenemies had been near she found always the scent of two human beings ona flat rock under the dwarf spruces and there were always the twotrails coming up and going down the brook</s>  she followed once closebehind the two children seeing them plainly all the way till they camein sight of the little cabin under the cliff and from the door herenemy man came out to meet them</s>  for these two little ones whose trailshe knew the old shewolf like most mother animals in the presence ofchildren felt no fear nor enmity whatever</s>
 but they watched her den andher own little ones that was sure enough and why should any one watcha den except to enter some time and destroy</s>  that is a question which nomother wolf could ever answer for the wild animals unlike dogs andblue jays and men mind strictly their own business and pay no attentionto other animals</s>  they hate also to be watched for the thought ofwatching always suggests to their minds that which followsthe huntthe rush the wild breakaway and the run for life</s>  had she not herselfwatched a hundred times at the rabbits form the foxs runway the deerpath the wildgoose nest</s>  what could she expect for her own littleones therefore when the man cubs beings of larger reach and unknownpower came daily to watch at her den</s> all this unanswered puzzle must have passed through the old wolfs headas she trotted up the brook away from the indian cabin in the twilight</s> when in doubt trust your fearsthat is wolf wisdom in a nutshell andthat marks the difference between a wolf and a caribou for instancewhich in doubt trusts his nose or his curiosity</s>  so the old wolf tookcounsel of her fears for her little ones and that night carried themone by one in her mouth as a cat carries her kittens miles away overrocks and ravines and spruce thickets to another den where no human eyeever looked upon their play</s> shall we see them again little brother</s>  said mooka wistfully whenthey had climbed to their watchtower for the third time and seennothing</s>  and noel made confident answeroh yes we see um again lil sister</s>  wayeeses got um wandering footgo way off long ways bimeby come back on same trail</s>  he jus likeinjun like um old camp best</s>  oh yes sartin we see um again</s>  butnoels eyes looked far away as he spoke and in his heart he wasthinking of his bow and his long arrow with the sharp point and of amoonlit night with white shapes flitting noiselessly over the snow andscratching at the door of the little cabin</s> the way of the wolfa new experience had come to the little wolf cubs in a singlenightthe experience of fear</s>  for weeks they had lain hid in the darkden or played fearlessly in the bright sunshine guarded and kept atevery moment day or night by the gaunt old mother wolf that was theironly law their only companion</s>  at times they lay for hours hungry andrestless longing to go out into the bright world yet obeying astronger will than their own even at a distance</s>  for once a wildmother in her own dumb way has bidden her little ones lie still theyrarely stir from the spot refusing even to be dragged away from thenest or den knowing well the punishment in store if she return and findthem absent</s>  moreover it is useless to dissimulate to go out and playand then to be sleeping innocently with the cubs when the old wolfsshadow darkens the entrance</s>  no concealment is possible from wolfsnose before she enters the den the mother knows perfectly all that hashappened since she went away</s>  so the days glided by peacefully betweensleep and play the cubs trusting absolutely in the strength andtenderness that watched over them the mother building the cubs futureon the foundation of the two instincts which are strong in every wildcreature born into a world of dangerthe instinct to lie still and letnatures coloring hide all defenseless little ones and the instinct toobey instantly a stronger will than their own</s> there was no fear as yet only instinctive wariness for fear comeslargely from others example from alarms and excitement and cries ofdanger which only the grown animals understand</s>  the old wolf had beenundisturbed no dog or hunter had chased her no trap or pitfall hadentangled her swift feet</s>  moreover she had chosen her den well whereno man had ever stood and where only the eyes of two children had seenher at a distance</s>  so the little ones grew and played in the sunshineand had yet to learn what fear meant</s> one day at dusk the mother entered swiftly and without giving them foodas she had always done seized a cub and disappeared</s>  for the littleone which had never before ventured beyond sight of the den it was along journey indeed that followedmiles and miles beside roaringbrooks and mistfilled ravines through gloomy woods where no lightentered and over bare ridges where the big stars sparkled just over hisears as he hung limp as a rabbit skin from his mothers great jaws</s>  anowl hooted dismally whoohooo</s>  and though he knew the sound well inhis peaceful nights it brought now a certain shiver</s>  the wind wentsniffing suspiciously among the spruce branches a startled bird chirpedand whirred away out of their path the brook roared among the rocks abig salmon jumped and tumbled back with resounding splash and jumpedagain as if the otter were after him</s>  there was a sudden sharp cry thefirst and last voice of a hare when the weasel rises up in front of himthen silence and the fitful rustle of his mothers pads movingsteadily swiftly over dry leaves</s>  and all these sounds of thewilderness night spoke to the little cub of some new thing of swiftfeet that follow and of something unknown and terrible that waits forall unwary wild things</s>  so fear was born</s> the long journey ended at last before a dark hole in the hillside andthe smell of his mother the only familiar thing in his first strangepilgrimage greeted the cub from the rocks on either side as he passedin out of the starlight</s>  he was dropped without a sound in a larger denon some freshgathered leaves and dead grass and lay there all alonevery still with the new feeling trembling all over him</s>  a long hourpassed a second cub was laid beside him and the mother vanished asbefore another hour and the wolf cubs were all together again with themother feeding them</s>  nor did any of them know where they were nor whythey had come nor the long long way that led back to where the trailbegan</s> next day when they were called out to play they saw a different and moregloomy landscape a chaos of granite rocks a forest of evergreen thewhite plunge and rolling mist of a mountain torrent but no silver seawith fishingboats drifting over it like clouds in the sea over theirheads and no gray hut with children running about like ants on thedistant shore</s>  and as they played they began for the first time toimitate the old mother keeping guard over them sitting up often towatch and listen and sift the winds trying to understand what fear wasand why they had been taken away from the sunny hillside where the worldwas so much bigger and brighter than here</s>  but home is where motheristhat fortunately is also true of the little wood folk whounderstand it in their own savage way for a seasonand in their wonderat their new surroundings the memory of the old home gradually fadedaway</s>  they never knew with what endless care the new den had beenchosen how the mother in the days when she knew she was watched hadsearched it out and watched over it and put her nose to every ridge andravine and brookside day after day till she was sure that no footsave that of the wild things had touched the soil within miles of theplace</s>  they felt only a greater wildness a deeper solitude and theynever forgot though they were unmolested the strange feeling that wasborn in them on that first terrifying night journey in their mothersjaws</s>           soon the food that was brought home at dawnthe rabbit or grouse orthe bunch of rats hanging by their tails with which the mothersupplemented their midday drink of milkbecame altogether too scant tosatisfy their clamorous appetites and in the bright afternoons and thelong summer twilights the mother led them forth on short journeys tohunt for themselves</s>  no big caribou or cunning fox cub as one mightsuppose but rats and mice and such small deer were the limit of themothers ambition for her little ones</s>  they began on stupid grubs thatone could find asleep under stones and roots and then on beetles thatscrambled away briskly at the first alarm and then when the sunshinewas brightest on grasshopperslively wary fellows that zipped andbuzzed away just when you were sure you had them and that generallylanded from an astounding jump facing in a different direction like aflea so as to be ready for your next move</s> it was astonishing how quickly the cubs learned that game is not to bepicked up tamely like huckleberries and changed their style ofhuntingcreeping instead of trotting openly so that even a porcupinemust notice them hiding behind rocks and bushes and tufts of grass tillthe precise moment came and then leaping with the swoop of a goshawk ona ptarmigan</s>  a wolf that cannot catch a grasshopper has no businesshunting rabbitsthis seemed to be the unconscious motive that led theold mother every sunny afternoon to ignore the thickets where game washiding plentifully and take her cubs to the dry sunny plains on theedge of the caribou barrens</s>  there for hours at a time they huntedelusive grasshoppers rushing helterskelter over the dry moss leapingup to strike at the flying game with their paws like a kitten orsnapping wildly to catch it in their mouths and coming down with abackbreaking wriggle to keep themselves from tumbling over on theirheads</s>  then on again with a droll expression and noses sharpened likeexclamation points to find another grasshopper</s> small business indeed and often ludicrous this playing at grasshopperhunting</s>  so it seems to us so also perhaps to the wise old motherwhich knew all the ways of game from crickets to caribou and fromground sparrows to wild geese</s>  but play is the first greateducatorthat is as true of animals as of menand to the cubs theirrough helterskelter after hoppers was as exciting as a stag hunt to thepack as full of surprises as the wild chase through the soft snow aftera litter of lynx kittens</s>  and though they knew it not they werelearning things every hour of the sunny playful afternoons that theywould remember and find useful all the days of their life</s> so the funny little hunt went on the mother watching gravely under abush where she was inconspicuous and the cubs full of zest andinexperience missing the flying tidbits more often than they swallowedthem until they learned at last to locate all game accurately beforechasing or alarming it and that is the rule learned from huntinggrasshoppers which a wolf follows ever afterward</s>  even after they knewjust where the grasshopper was hiding watching them after a jump andleaped upon him swiftly from a distance he often got away when theylifted their paws to eat him</s>  for the grasshopper was not dead under thelight paw as they supposed but only pressed into the moss waiting forhis chance to jump</s>  then the cubs learned another lesson to hold theirgame down with both paws pressed closely together inserting their noseslike a wedge and keeping every crack of escape shut tight until they hadthe slippery morsel safe under their back teeth</s>  and even then it wasdeliciously funny to watch their expression as they chewed openingtheir jaws wide as if swallowing a rabbit snapping them shut again asthe grasshopper wiggled and always with a doubt in their closeseteyes a questioning twist of head and ears as if they were not quitesure whether or not they were really eating him</s> another suggestive thing came out in these hunts which you must noticewhether you watch wolves or coyotes or a den of fox cubs</s>  though nosound came from the watchful old mother the cubs seemed at everyinstant under absolute control</s>  one would rush away pellmell after ahopper miss him and tumble away again till he was some distance fromthe busy group on the edge of the big lonely barren</s>  in the midst of hischase the mother would raise her head and watch the cub intently</s>  nosound was uttered that human ears could hear but the chase ended rightthere on the instant and the cub came trotting back like a wellbrokensetter at the whistle</s>  it was marvelous beyond comprehension thisabsolute authority and this silent command that brought a wolf backinstantly from the wildest chase and that kept the cubs all togetherunder the watchful eyes that followed every movement</s>  no wonder wolvesare intelligent in avoiding every trap and in hunting together to outwitsome fleetfooted quarry with unbelievable cunning</s>  here on the edge ofthe vast untrodden barren far from human eyes in an ordinary familyof wolf cubs playing wild and free eager headstrong hungry yetalways under control and instantly subject to a wiser head and astronger will than their own was the explanation of it all</s>  later inthe bitter hungry winter when a big caribou was afoot and the pack hoton his trail the cubs would remember the lesson and every free wolfwould curb his hunger obeying the silent signal to ease the game andfollow slowly while the leader raced unseen through the woods to headthe game and lie in ambush by the distant runway</s> from grasshoppers the cubs took to hunting the woodmice that nested inthe dry moss and swarmed on the edges of every thicket</s>  this was keenerhunting for the woodmouse moves like a ray of light and always makesat least one false start to mislead any that may be watching for him</s> the cubs soon learned that when tookhees appeared and dodged back againas if frightened it was not because he had seen them but just becausehe always appears that way</s>  so they crouched and hid like a cat andwhen a gray streak shot over the gray moss and vanished in a tuft ofgrass they leaped for the spotand always found it vacant</s>  for tookheesalways doubles on his trail or burrows for a distance under the mossand never hides where he disappears</s>  it took the cubs a long while tofind that out and then they would creep and watch and listen till theycould locate the game by a stir under the moss and pounce upon it andnose it out from between their paws just as they had done with thegrasshoppers</s>  and when they crunched it at last like a ripe plum undertheir teeth it was a delicious tidbit worth all the trouble they hadtaken to get it</s>  for your wolf unlike the ferocious grandmothereatingcreature of the nursery is at heart a peaceable fellow most at homeand most happy when mouse hunting</s> there was another kind of this mouse chasing which furnished bettersport and more juicy mouthfuls to the young cubs</s>
 here and there on thenewfoundland mountains the snow lingers all summer long</s>  in everynorthern hollow of the hills you see from a distance white patches nobigger than your hat sparkling in the sun but when you climb thereafter bear or caribou you find great snowfields acres in extent andfrom ten to a hundred feet deep packed close and hard with the pressureof a thousand winters</s>  often when it rains in the valleys and raisesthe salmon rivers to meet your expectations a thin covering of new snowcovers these white fields and then if you go there you will find thenew page written all over with the feet of birds and beasts</s>  the miceespecially love these snowfields for some unknown reason</s>  all along theedges you find the delicate lacelike tracery which shows where littlefeet have gone on busy errands or played together in the moonlight andif you watch there awhile you will surely see tookhees come out of themoss and scamper across a bit of snow and dive back to cover under themoss again as if he enjoyed the feeling of the cold snow under his feetin the summer sunshine</s>
 he has tunnels there too going down to solidice where he hides things to keep which would spoil if left in the heatof his den under the mossy stone and when food is scarce he draws uponthese coldstorage rooms but most of his summer snow journeys if onemay judge from watching him and from following his tracks are taken forplay or comfort just as the bull caribou comes up to lie in the snowwith the strong sea wind in his face to escape the flies which swarm inthe thickets below</s>  owl and hawk fox and weasel and wildcatall theprowlers of the day and night have long since discovered these goodhuntinggrounds and leave the prints of wing and claw over the recordsof the woodmice but still tookhees returns led by his love of thesnowfields and thrives and multiplies spite of all his enemies</s> one moonlit night the old wolf took her cubs to the edge of one of thesesnowfields where the eager eyes soon noticed dark streaks shootinghither and yon over the bare white surface</s>  at first they chased themwildly but one might as well try to catch a moonbeam which has not somany places to hide as a woodmouse</s>  then remembering the grasshoppersthey crouched and crept and so caught a few</s>  meanwhile old mother wolflay still in hiding contenting herself with snapping up the game thatcame to her instead of chasing it wildly all over the snowfield</s>  theexample was not lost for imitation is strong among intelligent animalsand most of what they learn is due simply to following the mother</s>  soonthe cubs were still one lying here under shadow of a bush anotherthere by a gray rock that lifted its head out of the snow</s>  as a darkstreak moved nervously by one of these hidingplaces there would be arush a snap the pchap pchap of jaws crunching a delicious morselthen all quiet again with only gray innocentlooking shadows restingsoftly on the snow</s>  so they moved gradually along the edges of the greatwhite field and next morning the tracks were all there plain asdaylight telling their silent story of good hunting</s> to vary their diet the mother now took them down to the shore to huntamong the rocks for ducks eggs</s>  they were there by the hundredsscattered along the lonely bays just above highwater line where theeiders had their nests</s> at first old mother wolf showed them where to look and when she hadfound a clutch of eggs would divide them fairly keeping the hungry cubsin order at a little distance and bringing each one his share which heate without interference</s>  then when they understood the thing theyscattered nimbly to hunt for themselves and the real fun began</s> now a cub poking his nose industriously into every cranny and underevery thick bush would find a great roll of down plucked from themother birds breast and scraping the top off carefully with his pawwould find five or six large palegreen eggs which he gobbled downshells ducklings and all before another cub should smell the good findand caper up to share it</s>  again he would be startled out of his wits asa large brown bird whirred and fluttered away from under his very nose</s> sitting on his tail he would watch her with comical regret and longingtill she tumbled into the tide and drifted swiftly away out of dangerthen remembering what he came for he would turn and follow her trailback to the nest out of which she had stolen at his approach and findthe eggs all warm for his breakfast</s>  and when he had eaten all he wantedhe would take an egg in his mouth and run about uneasily here and therelike a dog with a bone when he thinks he is watched till he had made asad crisscross of his trail and found a spot where none could see him</s> there he would dig a hole and bury his egg and go back for more and onhis way would meet another cub running about with an egg in his mouthlooking for a spot where no one would notice him</s> from mice and eggs the young cubs turned to rabbits and hares and thesewere their staple food ever afterward when other game was scarce and thewoodmice were hidden deep under the winter snows safe at last for alittle season from all their enemies</s>  here for the first time the fatherwolf appeared coming in quietly one late afternoon as if he knew ashe probably did just when he was needed</s>  beyond a glance he paid noattention whatever to the cubs only taking his place opposite themother as the wolves started abreast in a long line to beat the thicket</s> by night the cubs had already caught several rabbits snapping them upas they played heedlessly in the moonlight just as they had done withthe woodmice</s>  by day however the hunting was entirely different</s>  thenthe hares and rabbits are resting in their hidden forms under the fernsor in a hollow between the roots of a brown stump</s>  like game birdswhether on the nest or sitting quiet in hiding the rabbits give out farless scent at such times than when they are active and the cubsstealing through the dense cover like shadows in imitation of the oldwolves and always hunting upwind would use their keen noses to locatemoktaques before alarming him</s>  if a cub succeeded and snapped up arabbit before the surprised creature had time to gather headway hedropped behind with his catch while the rest went slowly carefully onthrough the cover</s>  if he failed as was generally the case at first acurious bit of wolf intelligence and wolf training came out at once</s> as the wolves advanced the father and mother would steal gradually aheadat either end of the line rarely hunting themselves but drawing thenearest cubs attention to any game they had discovered and then movingsilently to one side and a little ahead to watch the result</s>  when thecub rushed and missed and the startled rabbit went flying awaywhirling to left or right as rabbits always do there would be alightning change at the end of the line</s>  a terrific rush a snap of thelong jaws like a steel trapthen the old wolf would toss back therabbit with a broken back for the cub to finish him</s>  not till the cubsfirst and then the mother had satisfied their hunger would the oldhewolf hunt for himself</s>  then he would disappear and they would notsee him for days at a time until food was scarce and they needed himonce more</s> one day when the cubs were hungry and food scarce because of theirpersistent hunting near the den the mother brought them to the edge ofa dense thicket where rabbits were plentiful enough but where the coverwas so thick that they could not follow the frightened game for aninstant</s>  the old hewolf had appeared at a distance and then vanishedand the cubs trotting along behind the mother knew nothing of what wascoming or what was expected of them</s>  they lay in hiding on the lee sideof the thicket each one crouching under a bush or root with the motheroff at one side perfectly hidden as usual</s> presently a rabbit appeared hopping along in a crazy way and ran plumpinto the jaws of a wolf cub which leaped up as if out of the groundand pulled down his game from the very top of the high jump whichmoktaques always gives when he is suddenly startled</s>  another and anotherrabbit appeared mysteriously and doubled back into the cover beforethey could be caught</s>  the cubs were filled with wonder</s>  such hunting wasnever seen before for rabbits stirred abroad by day and ran right intothe hungry mouths instead of running away</s>  then slinking along like ashadow and stopping to look back and sniff the wind appeared a big redfox that had been sleeping away the afternoon on top of a stump in thecenter of the thicket</s> the old mothers eyes began to blaze as eleemos drew near</s>  there was arush swift and sudden as the swoop of an eagle a sharp call to followas the mothers long jaws closed over the small of the back just as thefox turned to leap away</s>  then she flung the paralyzed animal back like aflash the young wolves tumbled in upon him and before he knew what hadhappened eleemos the sly one was stretched out straight with one cub athis tail and another at his throat tugging and worrying and grumblingdeep in their chests as the lust of their first fighting swept overthem</s>  then in vague vanishing glimpses the old hewolf appearedquartering swiftly silently back and forth through the thicketdriving every living thing downwind to where the cubs and the motherwere waiting to receive it</s> illustration as the mothers long jaws closed over the small of thebackthat one lesson was enough for the cubs though years would pass beforethey could learn all the fine points of this beating the bush to knowalmost at a glance where the game whether grouse or hare or fox orlucivee was hiding in the cover and then for one wolf to drive itslowly or swiftly as the case might require while the other hid besidethe most likely path of escape</s>  a family of grouse must be coaxed alongand never see what is driving them else they will flit into a tree andbe lost while a cat must be startled out of her wits by a swift rushand sent flying away before she can make up her stupid mind what the rowis all about</s>  a fox almost as cunning as wayeeses himself must be madeto think that some dog enemy is slowly puzzling out his cold trailwhile a musquash searching for bakeapples or a beaver going inland tocut wood for his winter supplies of bark must not be driven but befollowed up swiftly by the path or canal by which he has ventured awayfrom the friendly water</s> all these and many more things must be learned slowly at the expense ofmany failures especially when the cubs took to hunting alone and theold wolves were not there to show them how but they never forgot theprinciple taught in that first rabbit drivethat two hunters arebetter than one to outwit any game when they hunt intelligentlytogether</s>  that is why you so often find wolves going in pairs and whenyou study them or follow their tracks you discover that they playcontinually into each others hands</s>  they seem to share the spoil asintelligently as they catch it the wolf that lies beside the runway andpulls down the game giving up a portion gladly to the companion thatbeats the bush and rarely indeed is there any trace of quarrelingbetween them</s> like the eagleswhich have long since learned the advantage of huntingin pairs and of scouting for game in single filethe wolves whenhunting deer on the open barrens where it is difficult to conceal theiradvance always travel in files one following close behind the otherso that seen from in front where the game is watching two or threewolves will appear like a lone animal trotting across the plain</s>  thatalarms the game far less at first and not until the deer starts awaydoes the second wolf appear shooting out from behind the leader</s>  thesight of another wolf appearing suddenly on his flank throws a youngdeer into a panic in which he is apt to lose his head and be caught bythe cunning hunters</s> curiously enough the plains indians who travel in the same way whenhunting or scouting for enemies first learned the trickso an oldchief told me and it is one of the traditions of his peoplefromwatching the timber wolves in their stealthy advance over the openplaces</s> the wolves were stealing through the woods all together one late summerafternoon having beaten a cover without taking anything when thepuzzled cubs suddenly found themselves alone</s>  a moment before they hadbeen trotting along with the old wolves nosing every cranny and knothole for mice and grubs and stopping often for a roll and frolic asyoung cubs do in the gladness of life now they pressed close togetherlooking listening while a subtle excitement filled all the woods</s>  forthe old wolves had disappeared shooting ahead in great silent boundswhile the cubs waited with ears cocked and noses quivering as if asilent command had been understood</s> the silence was intense not a sound not a stir in the quiet woodswhich seemed to be listening with the cubs and to be filled with thesame thrilling expectation</s>  suddenly the silence was broken by heavyplunges far ahead crash</s>  bump</s>  bump</s>  and there broke forth such anuproar of yaps and howls as the cubs had never heard before</s>  instantlythey broke away on the trail joining their shrill yelpings to theclamor so different from the ordinary stealthy wolf hunt and filledwith a nameless excitement which they did not at all understand till thereek of caribou poured into their hungry nostrils whereupon they yelpedlouder than ever</s>  but they did not begin to understand the matter tillthey caught glimpses of gray backs bounding hither and yon in theunderbrush while the two great wolves raced easily on either sideyapping sharply to increase the excitement and guiding the startledfoolish deer as surely as intelligently as a pair of collies herd aflock of frightened sheep</s> when the cubs broke out of the dense cover at last they found the twoold wolves sitting quietly on their tails before a rugged wall of rocksthat stretched away on either hand at the base of a great bare hill</s>  infront of them was a young cow caribou threatening savagely with hornsand hoofs while behind her cowered two halfgrown fawns crowded into acrevice of the rocks</s>  anger rather than fear blazed out in themothers mild eyes</s>  now she turned swiftly to press her excited youngones back against the sheltering wall now she whirled with a savagegrunt and charged headlong at the wolves which merely leaped aside andsat down silently again to watch the game till the cubs raced out andhovered uneasily about with a thousand questions in every eye and earand twitching nostril</s> the reason for the hunt was now plain enough</s>  up to this time thecaribou had been let severely alone though they were very numerousscattered through the dense coverts in every valley and on everyhillside</s>  for wayeeses is no wanton killer as he is so oftenrepresented to be but sticks to small game whenever he can find it andleaves the deer unmolested</s>  as for his motive in the matter who shallsay since no one understands the half of what a wolf does every day</s> perhaps it is a mere matter of taste a preference for the smaller andmore juicy tidbits more likely it is a combination of instinct andjudgment with a possible outlook for the future unusual with beasts ofprey</s>  the moment the young wolves take to harrying the deeras theyinvariably do if the mother wolf be not with themthe caribou leave thecountry</s>  the herds become moreover so wild and suspicious after a verylittle wolf hunting that they are exceedingly difficult of approach andthere is no living thing on earth not even a white wolf or a trainedgreyhound that can tire or overtake a startled caribou</s>  the swingingrack of these big white wanderers looks easy enough when you see it butwhen the fleet staghounds are slipped as has been more than once testedin newfoundland try as hard as they will they cannot keep within sightof the deer for a single quartermile and no limit has ever yet beenfound either by dog or wolf to megaleeps tirelessness</s>  so the oldwolves relying possibly upon past experience keep the cubs and holdthemselves strictly to small game as long as it can possibly be found</s> then when the bitter days of late winter come with their scarcity ofsmall game and their unbearable hunger the wolves turn to the caribouas a last resort killing a few here by stealth rather than speed andthen when the game grows wild going far off to another range where thedeer have not been disturbed and so can be approached more easily</s> on this afternoon however the old mother wolf had run plump upon thecaribou and her fawns in the midst of a thicket and had leaped forwardpromptly to round them up for her hungry cubs</s>  it would have been theeasiest matter in the world for an old wolf to hamstring one of the slowfawns or the mother caribou herself as she hovered in the rear todefend her young but there were other thoughts in the shaggy gray headthat had seen so much hunting</s>  so the mother wolf drove the deer slowlypuzzling them more and more as a collie distracts the herd by hisyapping out into the open where her cubs might join in the hunting</s> the wolves now drew back all save the mother which advancedhesitatingly to where the caribou stood with lowered head watchingevery move</s>  suddenly the cow charged so swiftly furiously that theold wolf seemed almost caught and tumbled away with the broad hoofsstriking savagely at her flanks</s>  farther and farther the caribou droveher enemy roused now to frenzy at the wolfs nearness and apparentcowardice</s>  then she whirled in a panic and rushed back to her littleones only to find that all the other wolves as if frightened by herfurious charge had drawn farther back from the cranny in the rocks</s> again the old shewolf approached cautiously and again the caribouplunged at her and followed her lame retreat with headlong fury</s>  anelectric shock seemed suddenly to touch the huge hewolf</s>  like a flashhe leaped in on the fawns</s>  one quick snap of the long jaws with theterrible fangs then as if the whole thing were a bit of play he lopedaway easily with the cubs circling to join the mother wolf whichstrangely enough did not return to the attack as the caribou chargedback driving the cubs and the old hewolf away like a flock of sheep</s> the coast was now clear not an enemy in the way and the mothercaribou with a triumphant bleat to her fawns to follow plunged backinto the woods whence she had come</s> one fawn only followed her</s>  the other took a step or two sank to hisknees and rolled over on his side</s>  when the wolves drew near quietlywithout a trace of the ferocity or the howling clamor with which suchscenes are usually pictured the game was quite dead one quick snap ofthe old wolfs teeth just behind the fore legs having pierced the heartmore surely than a hunters bullet</s>
 and the mother caribou plungingwildly away through the brush with the startled fawn jumping at herheels could not know that her mad flight was needless that theterrible enemy which had spared her and let her go free had no need nordesire to follow</s>           the fat autumn had now come with its abundant fare and the caribou werenot again molested</s>  flocks of grouse and ptarmigan came out of the thickcoverts in which they had been hiding all summer and began to pluckthe berries of the open plains where they could easily be waylaid andcaught by the growing wolf cubs</s>  plover came in hordes sweeping overthe straits from the labrador and when the wolves surrounded a flock ofthe queer birds and hitched nearer and nearer sinking their gray bodiesin the yielding gray moss till they looked like weatherworn logs thehunting was full of tense excitement though the juicy mouthfuls werefew and far between</s>  fox cubs roamed abroad away from their mothersselfwilled and reveling in the abundance and it was now easy for twoof the young wolves to drive a fox out of his daytime cover and catchhim as he stole away</s> after the plover came the ducks in myriads filling the ponds andflashets of the vast barrens with tumultuous quacking and the youngwolves learned like the foxes to decoy the silly birds by rousingtheir curiosity</s>  they would hide in the grass while one played androlled about on the open shore till the ducks saw him and began tostretch their necks and gabble their amazement at the strange thingwhich they had never seen before</s>  shy and wild as he naturally is aduck like a caribou or a turkey must take a peek at every new thing</s> now silent now gabbling all together the flock would veer and scatterand draw together again and finally swing in toward the shore everyneck drawn straight as a string the better to see what was going on</s> nearer and nearer they would come till a swift rush out of the grasssent them off headlong splashing and quacking with crazy clamor</s>  butone or two always stayed behind with the wolves to pay the price ofcuriosity</s> then there were the young geese which gathered in immense flocks in theshallow bays preparing and drilling for the autumn flight</s>  late in theafternoon the old mother wolf with her cubs would steal down through thewoods hiding and watching the flocks and following them stealthily asthey moved along the shore</s>  at night the great flock would approach asandbar well out of the way of rocks and brush and everything thatmight hide an enemy and go to sleep in close little family groups onthe open shore</s>  as the night darkened four shadows would lengthen outfrom the nearest bank of shadows creeping onward to the sandbar withthe slow patience of the hours</s>  a rush a startled honk</s>  a terrificclamor of wings and throats and smitten water</s>  then the four shadowswould rise up from the sand and trot back to the woods each with aburden on its shoulders and a sparkle in the closeset eyes over thepointed jaws which were closed on the neck of a goose holding it tightlest any outcry escape to tell the startled flock what had happened</s> besides this abundant game there were other good things to eat and thecubs rarely dined of the same dish twice in succession</s>  salmon and bigseatrout swarmed now in every shallow of the clear brooks and afterspawning these fish were much weakened and could easily be caught by alittle cunning</s>  every day and night the tide ebbed and flowed and everytide left its contribution in windrows of dead herring and caplin withscattered crabs and mussels for a relish like plums in a pudding</s>  awolf had only to trot for a mile or two along the tide line of a lonelybeach picking up the good things which the sea had brought him andthen go back to sleep or play satisfied</s>  and if wayeeses wanted game totry his mettle and cunning there were the big fat seals barking on theblack rocks and he had only to cut between them and the sea and throwhimself upon the largest seal as the herd floundered ponderously back tosafety</s>  a wolf rarely grips and holds an enemy he snaps and lets goand snaps again at every swift chance but here he must either hold fastor lose his big game and what between holding and letting go as theseals whirled with bared teeth and snapped viciously in turn as theyscrambled away to the sea the wolves had a lively time of it</s>  oftenindeed spite of three or four wolves a big seal would tumble into thetide where the sharks followed his bloody trail and soon finished him</s> now for the first time the wolves led by the rich abundance began tokill more than they needed for food and to hide it away like thesquirrels in anticipation of the coming winter</s>  like the blue and thearctic foxes a strange instinct to store things seems to stir dimly attimes within them</s>  occasionally instead of eating and sleeping after akill the cubs led by the mother wolf would hunt half of the day andnight and carry all they caught to the snowfields</s>  there each one wouldsearch out a cranny in the rocks and hide his game covering it overdeeply with snow to kill the scent of it from the prowling foxes</s>  thenfor days at a time they would forget the coming winter and play asheedlessly as if the woods would always be as full of game as now andagain the mood would be upon them strongly and they would kill all theycould find and hide it in another place</s>  but the instinctif indeed itwere instinct and not the natural result of the mothers ownexperiencewas weak at best and the first time the cubs were hungry orlazy they would trail off to the hidden store</s>  long before the springwith its bitter need was upon them they had eaten everything and hadreturned to the empty storehouse at least a dozen times as a dog goesagain and again to the place where he once hid a bone and nosed it allover regretfully to be quite sure that they had overlooked nothing</s> more interesting to the wolves in these glad days than the game or thestorehouse or the piles of caplin which they cached under the sand onthe shore were the wandering herds of caribousplendid old stags withmassive antlers and longlegged inquisitive fawns trotting after thesleek cows whose heads carried small pointed horns more deadly by farthan the stags cumbersome antlers</s>  wherever the wolves went theycrossed the trails of these wanderers swarming out of the thicketssometimes by twos and threes and again in straggling endless linesconverging upon the vast open barrens where the caribou gathered toselect their mates for another year</s>  where they all came from was amystery that filled the cubs heads with constant wonder</s>  during thesummer you see little of themhere a cow with her fawn hiding deep inthe cover there a big stag standing out like a watchman on the mountaintop but when the early autumn comes they are everywhere crossingrivers and lakes at regular points and following deep paths which theirancestors have followed for countless generations</s> the cows and fawns seemed gentle and harmless enough though their verynumbers filled the young wolves with a certain awe</s>  after their firstlesson it would have been easy enough for the cubs to have killed allthey wanted and to grow fat and lazy as the bears which were nowstuffing themselves before going off to sleep for the winter but theold mother wolf held them firmly in check for with plenty of small gameeverywhere all wolves are minded to go quietly about their own businessand let the caribou follow their own ways</s>  when october came it broughtthe big stags into the opensplendid imposing beasts with swollennecks and fierce red eyes and long white manes tossing in the wind</s>  thenthe wolves had to stand aside for the stags roamed over all the landpawing the moss in fury bellowing their hoarse challenge and charginglike a whirlwind upon every living thing that crossed their paths</s> when the mother wolf with her cubs at heel saw one of these big furiesat a distance she would circle prudently to avoid him</s>  again as thecubs hunted rabbits they would hear a crash of brush and a furiouschallenge as some quarrelsome stag winded them and the mother with hercubs gathered close about her would watch alertly for his headlong rush</s> as he charged out the wolves would scatter and leap nimbly aside thensit down on their tails in a solemn circle and watch as if studying thestrange beast</s>  again and again he would rush upon them only to findthat he was fighting the wind</s>  mad as a hornet he would single out acub and follow him headlong through brush and brake till some subtlewarning thrilled through his madness telling him to heed his flankthen as he whirled he would find the savage old mother close at hisheels her white fangs bared and a dangerous flash in her eyes as shesaw the hamstring so near so easy to reach</s>  one spring and a snap andthe ramping masterful stag would have been helpless as a rabbit histendons cut cleanly at the hock another snap and he must come downspite of his great power and be food for the growing cubs that sat ontheir tails watching him unterrified now by his fierce challenge</s>  butmegaleeps time had not yet come besides he was too tough</s>  so thewolves studied him awhile amused perhaps at the rough play then as ifat a silent command they vanished like shadows into the nearest coverleaving the big stag in his rage to think himself master of all theworld</s> sometimes as the old hewolf ranged alone a silent powerfulnoblelooking brute he would meet the caribou and there would be afascinating bit of animal play</s>  he rarely turned aside knowing his ownpower and the cows and fawns after one look would bound aside and rackaway at a marvelous pace over the barrens</s>  in a moment or two findingthat they were not molested they would turn and watch the wolfcuriously till he disappeared trying perhaps to puzzle it out why theferocious enemy of the deep snows and the bitter cold should now beharmless as the passing birds</s> again a young bull with his keen polished spikehorns more active anddangerous but less confident than the overantlered stags would standin the old wolfs path disputing with lowered front the right of way</s> here the right of way meant a good deal for in many places on the highplains the scrub spruces grow so thickly that a man can easily walk overthe tops of them on his snowshoes and the only possible passage insummertime is by means of the numerous paths worn through the scrub bythe passing of animals for untold ages</s>  so one or the other of the twosplendid brutes that now approached each other in the narrow way mustturn aside or be beaten down underfoot</s> quietly steadily the old wolf would come on till almost withinspringing distance when he would stop and lift his great headwrinkling his chops to show the long white fangs and rumbling a warningdeep in his massive chest</s>  then the caribou would lose his nerve hewould stamp and fidget and bluster and at last begin to circlenervously crashing his way into the scrub as if for a chance to takehis enemy in the flank</s>  whereupon the old wolf would trot quietly alongthe path paying no more heed to the interruption while the young bullwould stand wondering his body hidden in the scrub and his head thrustinto the narrow path to look after his strange adversary</s> another time as the old wolf ranged along the edges of the barrenswhere the caribou herds were gathering he would hear the challenge of ahuge stag and the warning crack of twigs and the thunder of hoofs as thebrute charged</s>  still the wolf trotted quietly along watching from thecorners of his eyes till the stag was upon him when he sprang lightlyaside and let the rush go harmlessly by</s>  sitting on his tail he wouldwatch the caribou closelyand who could tell what was passing behindthose cunning eyes

failure and every time the wolf leaped aside he left a terriblegash in his enemys neck or side punishing him cruelly for his bullyingattack yet strangely refusing to kill as he might have done or toclose on the hamstring with one swift snap that would have put the bigbrute out of the fight forever</s>  at last knowing perhaps from pastexperience the uselessness of punishing or of disputing with this madmanthat felt no wounds in his rage the wolf would lope away to coverfollowed by a victorious buglecry that rang over the wide barren andechoed back from the mountain side</s>  then the wolf would circle backstealthily and put his nose down into the stags hoofmarks for a longdeep sniff and go quietly on his way again</s>  a wolfs nose neverforgets</s>  when he finds that trail

distant wolftopped pinnacles and joinedin the wailing answer</s>  then the wolves would sit very still listeningwith cocked ears to the cry of their captive kinsmen till the dismalhowling died away into silence when they would start the clamor intolife again by giving the wolfs challenge</s> why they did it what they felt there in the strange unreality of themoonlight and what hushed their profound enmity none can tell</s> ordinarily the wolf hates both fox and dog and kills them whenever theycross his path but tonight the foxes were yapping an answer all aroundthem and sometimes a few

were doing</s> for hours the uncanny comedy would drag itself on into the tensemidnight silence the wailing cry growing more demented and heartrendingas the spell of ancient days fell again upon the degenerate huskies</s>  upon the lonely mountain tops the moon looked down still and cold andsaw upon every pinnacle a dog or a wolf each with his head turned up atthe sky howling his heart out</s>  down in the hamlet scattered for milesalong deep arm and the harbor shore sleepers stirred uneasily at theclamor the women clutching their babies close the men cursing thecrazy brutes and vowing all

to alarm itas little as need be it is impossible to say</s>  certainly the wolvesknow better apparently than men that persistent hunting destroys itsown object and that caribou especially when much alarmed by dogs orwolves or men will take the alarm quickly and the scattered herdsmoved by a common impulse of danger will trail far away to otherranges</s>  that is why the wolf unlike the less intelligent dog huntsalways in a silent stealthy unobtrusive way and why he stops huntingand goes away the instant his own hunger is satisfied or another wolfkills enough for all</s>  and that is also the probable reason why he letsthe deer alone as long as he can find any other game</s> this same intelligent provision was shown in another curious way</s>  when awolf in his wide ranging found a good huntingground where small gamewas plentiful he would snap up a rabbit silently in the twilight andthen go far away perhaps to join the other cubs in a gambol or tofollow them to the cliffs over a fishing village and set all the dogs tohowling</s>  by day he would lie close in some thick cover miles away fromhis huntingground</s>  at twilight he would steal back and hunt quietlyjust long enough

 it needed only aglance to show that the seven trails each one as clearcut and delicateas that of a prowling fox were the records of wolves cautious feetand that they were no longer beating the thickets for grouse andrabbits but moving swiftly all together for the edges of the vastbarrens where the caribou herds were feeding</s>  another glancebut herewe must have the cunning eyes of old tomah the hunterwould have toldthat two of the trails were those of enormous wolves which led the packtwo others were plainly cubs that had not yet lost the cub trick offrolicking in the soft snow

separate ways and head new packs of their ownin the great solitudes</s> out from the woods on the other side of the barren came two snowshoetrails which advanced with short steps and rested lightly on the snowas if the makers of the trails were little people whose weight on thesnowshoes made hardly more impression than the broad pads of moktaquesthe rabbit</s>  they followed stealthily the winding records of a score ofcaribou that had wandered like an eddying wind all over the barrenstopping here and there to paw great holes in the snow for the cariboumoss that covered all the earth beneath</s>

driven out likethe wild ducks by the fierce gales that raged over the whole coast</s>  withtheir abundant families and scant provisions they had followed the trailup the southwest brook till it doubled around the mountain and led intoa great silent wood sheltered on every side by the encircling hills</s> here the tilts were built with double walls filled in between withleaves and moss to

frightened at the discovery they turned as the cariboudo keeping their backs steadily to the winds and drifted slowly awaydown the long barren</s> hour after hour they struggled on hand in hand

lowbranched spruce they stopped again as though by acommon impulse while noel lifted his hands</s>  thanks thankskeesuolukh we can take care of ourselves now the brave little heartwas singing under

cold</s> first they ate a little of their bread and fish to keep up theirspirits thenfor the storm that was upon them might last fordaysthey set about preparing a shelter</s>  with a little search whoopingto each other lest they stray away they found a big dry stub that somegale had snapped off a few feet above the snow</s>  while mooka scurriedabout collecting birch bark and armfuls of dry

up around it to the height of hishead</s>  next with his knife he cut a lot of light poles and scrub sprucesand sticking the butts in his snowbank laid the tops like the sticksof a wigwam firmly against the big stub</s>  a few armfuls of spruce boughsshingled over this roof and a few minutes work shoveling snow thicklyupon them to hold them in place and to make a warm covering then adoorway

their firea wee sociablelittle fire such as an indian always builds which is far better than abig one for it draws you near and welcomes you cheerily instead ofdriving you away by its smoke and great heat</s>  soon the big stub itselfbegan to burn glowing steadily with a heat that filled the snug littlecommoosie while the smoke found its way out of the hole in the roofwhich noel had left for that purpose</s>  later the stub burned through toits hollow center and then they had a famous chimney which soon grewhot and glowing inside and added its mite to the childrens comfort</s> noel and mooka were drowsy now but before the long night closed in uponthem they had gathered more wood and laid aside some wisps of birchbark to use when they should wake cold and shivering and find theirlittle

thatthey had drifted before the storm down the whole length of the greatbarren and were camped now on the opposite side just under the highestridge of the top gallants</s>  there was not a track on the barrens hesaid not a sign of wolf or caribou which had probably wandered deeperinto the woods for shelter</s>  so they ate their bread to the last crumband their bird to the last bone and giving up all thought of huntingstarted up the big barren heading for the distant lodge where they hadlong since been given up for lost</s> they had crossed the barren and a mile of thick woods beyond when

had gone scarcely a hundred steps when noel whipped out a longarrow and pointed silently across the open</s>  from the woods on the otherside the caribou had broken out of a dozen tunnels under the sprucesand came trotting back in their old trails straight downwind to wherethe little hunters were hiding</s> the deer were acting queerlynow plunging away with the high awkwardjumps that caribou use

witnessed on the lonely plains ofthe far north the caribou halting running away and halting again tolook back and watch the queer antics of their big enemies which seemednow so playful and harmless the cunning wolves playing on the gamescuriosity at every turn knowing well that if once frightened the deerwould break away at a pace which would make pursuit hopeless</s>  so theyfollowed rather than drove the foolish deer across the barren holdingthem with monkey tricks and kittens capers and restraining with aniron grip their own fearful hunger and the blind impulse to rush inheadlong and have it all quickly over</s> kneeling behind a big spruce noel was trying nervously the spring andtemper of his long bow divided in desire between the caribou whichthey needed sadly at home and one of the great wolves whose death wouldgive him a place among the mighty hunters when mooka clutched his armher eyes snapping with excitement her finger pointing silently back ontheir own trail</s>  a vague shadow glided swiftly among the trees</s>
 anenormous white wolf appeared vanished came near them again andcrouched down under a low spruce branch waiting</s> again the two trails had crossed in the snow</s>
 the big wolf as heappeared had thrust his nose into the snowshoe tracks and a sniff ortwo told him everythingwho had passed and how long ago and whatthey were doing and how far ahead they were now waiting</s>  but thecaribou were coming coaxed along marvelously by the cubs and the oldmother and the great silent wolf that had left the pack playing withthe game while he circled the barren at top speed now turned to thebusiness in hand with no thought nor fear of harm from the two childrenwhom he had watched but yesterday</s> not so noel</s>  the fire blazed out in his eyes the long bow swung to thewolf bending like a steel spring and the feathered shaft of an arrowlay close against the boys cheek</s>  but mooka caught his armlook noel his ear</s>  malsunsis my little wolf cub she breathedexcitedly</s>  and noel with a great wonder in his eyes slacked his bowwhile his thoughts jumped far away to the den on the mountains where thetrail began and to three little cubs playing like kittens with thegrasshoppers and the cloud shadows for the great wolf that lay so stillnear them his eyes fixed in a steady glow upon the coming caribou hadone ear bent sharply forward like a leaf that has been creased betweenthe fingers</s>

it was wrong to run little brother whispered mooka</s> why</s>  said noel</s> cause wayeeses see it and think we fraid</s> but i was fraid out there little sister confessed noel bravely</s> here we can climb tree good chance shoot um with my arrows</s> like two frightened rabbits they crouched under the fir staring backwith wild round eyes over the trail fearing every instant to see thesavage pack break out of the woods and come howling after them</s>  but onlythe single big wolf appeared trotting quietly along in their footsteps</s> within bowshot he stopped with head raised looking listening intently</s> then as if he had seen them in their hiding he turned aside circledwidely to the left and entered the woods far below</s> again the two little hunters hurried on through the silent snowfilledwoods a strange disquietude settling upon them as they felt they werefollowed by unseen feet</s>  soon the feeling grew too strong to resist</s> noel with his bow ready and a strange chill trickling like cold wateralong his spine was hiding behind a tree watching the back trail whena low exclamation from mooka made him turn</s>  there behind them not tensteps away a huge white wolf was sitting quietly on his tail watchingthem with absorbed silent intentness</s> fear and wonder and swift memories of old tomah and the wolf that hadfollowed him when he was lost swept over noel in a flood</s>  he roseswiftly the long bow bent and again a deadly arrow cuddled softlyagainst his cheek but there were doubts and fears in his eye till mookacaught his arm with a glad little laughmy

storm broke he hadcrouched with the pack in the hollow just in front of the littlehunters and although the wolves were hungry it was with feelings ofcuriosity only that they watched the children who seemed to thepowerful brutes hardly more to be feared than a couple of snowbirdshopping across the vast barren</s>  but they were children of menthat wasenough for the whitewolf packs which for untold years had never beenknown to molest a man</s>  this morning malsunsis had again crossed theirtrail</s>  he had seen them lying in wait for the caribou that his own packwere driving had seen noel smite

big wolf which moved aside timidly and sat downagain at a distance with the friendly expression of a lost collie ineyes and ears and wagging tail tip</s> cheerfully enough noel slacked his long bow for the wonder of the woodswas strong upon him and the huntingspirit which leads one forth tofrighten and kill and to break the blessed peace had vanished in thebetter sense of comradeship which steals over one when he watches thewood folk alone and friendly in the midst of the solitudes</s>  as they wenton their way again the big wolf trotted after them keeping close totheir trail but never

through the trees for some landmark on the distant hills</s> twice the big wolf trotted out to one side returned and trotted outagain in the same direction and noel taking the subtle hint as anindian
