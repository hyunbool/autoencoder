queen shebas ringby h</s>  rider haggardchapter ithe coming of the ringevery one has read the monograph i believe that is the right wordof my dear friend professor higgsptolemy higgs to give him his fullnamedescriptive of the tableland of mur in north central africa ofthe ancient underground city in the mountains which surrounded itand of the strange tribe of abyssinian jews or rather their mixeddescendants by whom it is or was inhabited</s>  i say every oneadvisedly for although the public which studies such works is usuallyselect that which will take an interest in them if the character of alearned and pugnacious personage is concerned is very wide indeed</s>  notto mince matters i may as well explain what i mean at once</s> professor higgss rivals and enemies of whom either the brilliancyof his achievements or his somewhat abrupt and pointed methods ofcontroversy seem to have made him a great many have risen up or ratherseated themselves and written him downwell an individual who strainsthe truth</s>  indeed only this morning one of these inquired in a letterto the press alluding to some adventurous traveller who i am toldlectured to the british association several years ago whether professorhiggs did not in fact ride across the desert to mur not upon a camelas he alleged but upon a land tortoise of extraordinary size</s> the innuendo contained in this epistle has made the professor who asi have already hinted is not by nature of a meek disposition extremelyangry</s>  indeed notwithstanding all that i could do he left his londonhouse under an hour ago with a whip of hippopotamus hide such as theegyptians call a koorbash purposing to avenge himself upon the personof his defamer</s>  in order to prevent a public scandal however i havetaken the liberty of telephoning to that gentleman who bold andvicious as he may be in print is physically small and i should sayof a timid character to get out of the way at once</s>  to judge from theabrupt fashion in which our conversation came to an end i imagine thatthe hint has been taken</s>  at any rate i hope for the best and asan extra precaution have communicated with the lawyers of my justlyindignant friend</s> the reader will now probably understand that i am writing this book notto bring myself or others before the public or to make money of which ihave no present need or for any purpose whatsoever except to set downthe bare and actual truth</s>  in fact so many rumours are flying aboutas to where we have been and what befell us that this has becomealmost necessary</s>  as soon as i laid down that cruel column of gibes andinsinuations to which i have alludedyes this very morning beforebreakfast this conviction took hold of me so strongly that i cabledto oliver captain oliver orme the hero of my history if it hasany particular hero who is at present engaged upon what must be anextremely agreeable journey round the worldasking his consent</s>  tenminutes since the answer arrived from tokyo</s>  here it isdo what you like and think necessary but please alter all names etcetera as propose returning via america and fear interviewers</s>  japanjolly place</s>  then follows some private matter which i need not insert</s> oliver is always extravagant where cablegrams are concerned</s> i suppose that before entering on this narration for the readersbenefit i had better give some short description of myself</s> my name is richard adams and i am the son of a cumberland yeoman whomarried a welshwoman</s>  therefore i have celtic blood in my veins whichperhaps accounts for my love of roving and other things</s>  i am now an oldman near the end of my course i suppose at any rate i was sixtyfivelast birthday</s>  this is my appearance as i see it in the glass beforeme tall spare i dont weigh more than a hundred and forty poundsthedesert has any superfluous flesh that i ever owned my lot having beenlike falstaff to lard the lean earth but in a hot climate my eyesare brown my face is long and i wear a pointed white beard whichmatches the white hair above</s> truth compels me to add that my general appearance as seen in thatglass which will not lie reminds me of that of a rather aged goatindeed to be frank by the natives among whom i have sojourned andespecially among the khalifas people when i was a prisoner there ihave often been called the white goat</s> of my very commonplace outward self let this suffice</s>  as for my recordi am a doctor of the old school</s>  think of it</s>  when i was a student atbart</s> s the antiseptic treatment was quite a new thing and administeredwhen at all by help of a kind of engine on wheels out of whichdisinfectants were dispensed with a pump much as the advanced gardenersprays a greenhouse today</s> i succeeded above the average as a student and in my early time asa doctor</s>  but in every mans life there happen things which whateverexcuses may be found for them would not look particularly well in coldprint nobodys record as understood by convention and the phariseecould really stand cold print also something in my blood made me itsservant</s>  in short having no strict ties at home and desiring to seethe world i wandered far and wide for many years earning my livingas i went never in my experience a difficult thing to do for i wasalways a master of my trade</s> my fortieth birthday found me practising at cairo which i mention onlybecause it was here that first i met ptolemy higgs who even then inhis youth was noted for his extraordinary antiquarian and linguisticabilities</s>  i remember that in those days the joke about him was that hecould swear in fifteen languages like a native and in thirtytwo withcommon proficiency and could read hieroglyphics as easily as a bishopreads the times</s> well i doctored him through a bad attack of typhoid but as he hadspent every farthing he owned on scarabs or something of the sort madehim no charge</s>  this little kindness i am bound to say he never forgotfor whatever his failings may be personally i would not trust him alonewith any object that was more than a thousand years old ptolemy is agood and faithful friend</s> in cairo i married a copt</s>  she was a lady of high descent the traditionin her family being that they were sprung from one of the ptolemaicpharaohs which is possible and even probable enough</s>  also she was achristian and well educated in her way</s>  but of course she remained anoriental and for a european to marry an oriental is as i have tried toexplain to others a very dangerous thing especially if he continuesto live in the east where it cuts him off from social recognition andintimacy with his own race</s>  still although this step of mine forced meto leave cairo and go to assouan then a littleknown place to practisechiefly among the natives god knows we were happy enough together tillthe plague took her and with it my joy in life</s> i pass over all that business since there are some things too dreadfuland too sacred to write about</s>  she left me one child a son who tofill up my cup of sorrow when he was twelve years of age was kidnappedby the mardis people</s> this brings me to the real story</s>  there is nobody else to writeit oliver will not higgs cannot outside of anything learned andantiquarian he is hopeless so i must</s>  at any rate if it is notinteresting the fault will be mine not that of the story which in allconscience is strange enough</s> we are now in the middle of june and it was a year ago last decemberthat on the evening of the day of my arrival in london after an absenceof half a lifetime i found myself knocking at the door of professorhiggss rooms in guildford street w</s> c</s>  it was opened by hishousekeeper mrs</s>  reid a thin and saturnine old woman who reminded andstill reminds me of a reanimated mummy</s>  she told me that the professorwas in but had a gentleman to dinner and suggested sourly that ishould call again the next morning</s>  with difficulty i persuaded her atlast to inform her master that an old egyptian friend had brought himsomething which he certainly would like to see</s> five minutes later i groped my way into higgss sittingroom which mrs</s> reid had contented herself with indicating from a lower floor</s>  it is alarge room running the whole width of the house divided into two byan arch where once in the georgian days there had been folding doors</s> the place was in shadow except for the firelight which shone upon atable laid ready for dinner and upon an extraordinary collection ofantiquities including a couple of mummies with gold faces arranged intheir coffins against the wall</s>  at the far end of the room however anelectric lamp was alight in the bowwindow hanging over another tablecovered with books and by it i saw my host whom i had not met fortwenty years although until i vanished into the desert we frequentlycorresponded and with him the friend who had come to dinner</s> first i will describe higgs who i may state is admitted even by hisenemies to be one of the most learned antiquarians and greatest mastersof dead languages in europe though this no one would guess from hisappearance at the age of about fortyfive</s>  in build short and stoutface round and highcoloured hair and beard of a fiery red eyeswhen they can be seenfor generally he wears a pair of large bluespectaclessmall and of an indefinite hue but sharp as needles</s>  dressso untidy peculiar and worn that it is said the police invariablyrequest him to move on should he loiter in the streets at night</s>  suchwas and is the outward seeming of my dearest friend professor ptolemyhiggs and i only hope that he wont be offended when he sees it setdown in black and white</s> that of his companion who was seated at the table his chin resting onhis hand listening to some erudite discourse with a rather distractedair was extraordinarily different especially by contrast</s>  a tallwellmade young man rather thin but broadshouldered and apparentlyfive or six and twenty years of age</s>  face cleancutso much so indeedthat the dark eyes alone relieved it from a suspicion of hardness hairshort and straight like the eyes brown expression that of a man ofthought and ability and when he smiled singularly pleasant</s>  such wasand is captain oliver orme who by the way i should explain is onlya captain of some volunteer engineers although in fact a very ablesoldier as was proved in the south african war whence he had then butlately returned</s> i ought to add also that he gave me the impression of a man not inlove with fortune or rather of one with whom fortune was not in loveindeed his young face seemed distinctly sad</s>  perhaps it was this thatattracted me to him so much from the first moment that my eyes fell onhimme with whom fortune had also been out of love for many years</s> while i stood contemplating this pair higgs looking up from thepapyrus or whatever it might be that he was reading i gathered laterthat he had spent the afternoon in unrolling a mummy and was studyingits spoils caught sight of me standing in the shadow</s> who the devil are you</s>  he exclaimed in a shrill and strident voicefor it acquires that quality when he is angry or alarmed and what areyou doing in my room</s> steady said his companion your housekeeper told you that somefriend of yours had come to call</s> oh yes so she did only i cant remember any friend with a face andbeard like a goat</s>  advance friend and alls well</s> so i stepped into the shining circle of the electric light and haltedagain</s> who is it</s>  who is it</s>  muttered higgs</s>  the face is the face ofofihave itof old adams only hes been dead these ten years</s>  the khalifagot him they said</s>  antique shade of the longlost adams please be sogood as to tell me your name for we waste time over a useless mystery</s> there is no need higgs since it is in your mouth already</s>  well ishould have known you anywhere but then your hair doesnt go white</s> not it too much colouring matter direct result of a sanguinedisposition</s>  well adamsfor adams you must bei am really delightedto see you especially as you never answered some questions in my lastletter as to where you got those first dynasty scarabs of which thegenuineness i may tell you has been disputed by certain enviousbeasts</s>  adams my dear old fellow welcome a thousand timesand heseized my hands and wrung them adding as his eye fell upon a ring iwore why whats that</s>  something quite unusual</s>  but never mind youshall tell me after dinner</s>  let me introduce you to my friend captainorme a very decent scholar of arabic with a quite elementary knowledgeof egyptology</s> mr</s>  orme interrupted the younger man bowing to me</s> oh well mr</s>  or captain whichever you like</s>  he means that he is notin the regular army although he has been all through the boer war andwounded three times once straight through the lungs</s>  heres the soup</s> mrs</s>  reid lay another place</s>  i am dreadfully hungry nothing gives mesuch an appetite as unrolling mummies it involves so much intellectualwear and tear in addition to the physical labour</s>  eat man eat</s>  wewill talk afterwards</s> so we ate higgs largely for his appetite was always excellent perhapsbecause he was then practically a teetotaller mr</s>  orme very moderatelyand i as becomes a person who has lived for months at a time ondatesmainly of vegetables which with fruits form my principaldietthat is if these are available for at a pinch i can exist onanything</s> when the meal was finished and our glasses had been filled with porthiggs helped himself to water lit the large meerschaum pipe he alwayssmokes and pushed round the tobaccojar which had once served as asepulchural urn for the heart of an old egyptian</s> now adams he said when we also had filled our pipes tell us whathas brought you back from the shades</s>  in short your story man yourstory</s> i drew the ring he had noticed off my hand a thick band of ratherlightcoloured gold of a size such as an ordinary woman might wear uponher first or second finger in which was set a splendid slab ofsapphire engraved with curious and archaic characters</s>  pointing to thesecharacters i asked higgs if he could read them</s> read them</s>  of course he answered producing a magnifying glass</s> cant you</s>  no i remember you never were good at anything more thanfifty years old</s>  hullo</s>  this is early hebrew</s>  ah</s>  ive got it and hereadthe gift of solomon the rulerno the great oneof israel belovedof jah to maqueda of shebaland queen daughter of kings child ofwisdom beautiful</s> thats the writing on your ring adamsa really magnificent thing</s> queen of shebabathmelachim daughter of kings with our old friendsolomon chucked in</s>  splendid quite splendid</s> and he touched the goldwith his tongue and tested it with his teeth</s>  humwhere did you getthis intelligent fraud from adams</s> oh</s>  i answered laughing the usual thing of course</s>  i bought itfrom a donkeyboy in cairo for about thirty shillings</s> indeed he replied suspiciously</s>  i should have thought the stone init was worth more than that although of course it may be nothingbut glass</s>  the engraving too is firstrate</s>  adams he added withseverity you are trying to hoax us but let me tell you what i thoughtyou knew by this timethat you cant take in ptolemy higgs</s>  thisring is a shameless swindle but who did the hebrew on it</s>  hes a goodscholar anyway</s> dont know i answered wasnt aware till now that it was hebrew</s>  totell you the truth i thought it was old egyptian</s>  all i do know isthat it was given or rather lent to me by a lady whose title is waldanagasta and who is supposed to be a descendant of solomon and the queenof sheba</s> higgs took up the ring and looked at it again then as though in a fitof abstraction slipped it into his waistcoat pocket</s> i dont want to be rude therefore i will not contradict you heanswered with a kind of groan or indeed say anything except thatif any one else had spun me that yarn i should have told him he wasa common liar</s>  but of course as every schoolboy knows waldanagastathat is child of kings in ethiopicis much the same asbathmelachimthat is daughter of kings in hebrew</s> here captain orme burst out laughing and remarked it is easy to seewhy you are not altogether popular in the antiquarian world higgs</s>  yourmethods of controversy are those of a savage with a stone axe</s> if you only open your mouth to show your ignorance oliver you hadbetter keep it shut</s>  the men who carried stone axes had advanced farbeyond the state of savagery</s>  but i suggest that you had bettergive doctor adams a chance of telling his story after which you cancriticize</s> perhaps captain orme does not wish to be bored with it i saidwhereon he answered at onceon the contrary i should like to hear it very muchthat is if youare willing to confide in me as well as in higgs</s> i reflected a moment since to tell the truth for sundry reasons myintention had been to trust no one except the professor whom i knew tobe as faithful as he is rough</s>  yet some instinct prompted me to makean exception in favour of this captain orme</s>  i liked the man there wassomething about those brown eyes of his that appealed to me</s>  also itstruck me as odd that he should happen to be present on this occasionfor i have always held that there is nothing casual or accidental in theworld that even the most trivial circumstances are either ordainedor the result of the workings of some inexorable law whereof the endis known by whatever power may direct our steps though it be not yetdeclared</s> certainly i am willing i answered your face and your friendshipwith the professor are passport enough for me</s>  only i must ask youto give me your word of honour that without my leave you will repeatnothing of what i am about to tell you</s> of course he answered whereon higgs broke inthere that will do you dont want us both to kiss the book do you</s> who sold you that ring and where have you been for the last dozenyears and whence do you come now</s> i have been a prisoner of the khalifas among other things</s>  i had fiveyears of that entertainment of which my back would give some evidenceif i were to strip</s>  i think i am about the only man who never embracedislam whom they allowed to live and that was because i am a doctorand therefore a useful person</s>  the rest of the time i have spentwandering about the north african deserts looking for my son roderick</s> you remember the boy or should for you are his godfather and i usedto send you photographs of him as a little chap</s> of course of course said the professor in a new tone i came acrossa christmas letter from him the other day</s>  but my dear adams whathappened</s>  i never heard</s> he went up the river to shoot crocodiles against my orders when he wasabout twelve years oldnot very long after his mothers death and somewandering mahdi tribesmen kidnapped him and sold him as a slave</s>  i havebeen looking for him ever since for the poor boy was passed on fromtribe to tribe among which his skill as a musician enabled me to followhim</s>  the arabs call him the singer of egypt because of his wonderfulvoice and it seems that he has learned to play upon their nativeinstruments</s> and now where is he</s>  asked higgs as one who feared the answer</s> he is or was a favourite slave among a barbarous halfnegroid peoplecalled the fung who dwell in the far interior of north central africa</s> after the fall of the khalifa i followed him there it took me severalyears</s>  some bedouin were making an expedition to trade with these fungand i disguised myself as one of them</s> on a certain night we camped at the foot of a valley outside a greatwall which encloses the holy place where their idol is</s>  i rode up tothis wall and through the open gateway heard some one with a beautifultenor voice singing in english</s>  what he sang was a hymn that i hadtaught my son</s>  it beginsabide with me fast falls the eventide</s> i knew the voice again</s>  i dismounted and slipped through the gatewayand presently came to an open space where a young man sat singing upona sort of raised bench with lamps on either side of him and a largeaudience in front</s>  i saw his face and notwithstanding the turban whichhe wore and his eastern robeyes and the passage of all those yearsiknew it for that of my son</s>  some spirit of madness entered into me andi called aloud roderick roderick</s>  and he started up staring abouthim wildly</s>  the audience started up also and one of them caught sightof me lurking in the shadow</s> with a howl of rage for i had desecrated their sanctuary they sprangat me</s>  to save my life coward that i was i fled back through thegates</s>  yes after all those years of seeking still i fled rather thandie and though i was wounded with a spear and stones managed to reachand spring upon my horse</s>  then as i was headed off from our campi galloped away anywhere still to save my miserable life from thosesavages so strongly is the instinct of selfpreservation implantedin us</s>  from a distance i looked back and saw by the light of the firedtents that the fung were attacking the arabs with whom i had travelledi suppose because they thought them parties to the sacrilege</s>  afterwardsi heard that they killed them every one poor men but i escaped whounwittingly had brought their fate upon them</s> on and on i galloped up a steep road</s>  i remember hearing lions roaringround me in the darkness</s>  i remember one of them springing upon myhorse and the poor beasts scream</s>  then i remember no more till i foundmyselfi believe it was a week or so laterlying on the verandah ofa nice house and being attended by some goodlooking women of anabyssinian cast of countenance</s> sounds rather like one of the lost tribes of israel remarked higgssarcastically puffing at his big meerschaum</s> yes something of that sort</s>  the details i will give you later</s>  themain facts are that these people who picked me up outside their gatesare called abati live in a town called mur and allege themselves tobe descended from a tribe of abyssinian jews who were driven out andmigrated to this place four or five centuries ago</s>  briefly theylook something like jews practise a very debased form of the jewishreligion are civilized and clever after a fashion but in the laststage of decadence from interbreedingabout nine thousand men is theirtotal fighting force although three or four generations ago they hadtwenty thousandand live in hourly terror of extermination by thesurrounding fung who hold them in hereditary hate as the possessorsof the wonderful mountain fortress that once belonged to theirforefathers</s> gibraltar and spain over again suggested orme</s> yes with this differencethat the position is reversed the abati ofthis central african gibraltar are decaying and the fung who answer tothe spaniards are vigorous and increasing</s> well what happened</s>  asked the professor</s> nothing particular</s>  i tried to persuade these abati to organize anexpedition to rescue my son but they laughed in my face</s>  by degreesi found out that there was only one person among them who was worthanything at all and she happened to be their hereditary ruler who borethe highsounding titles of walda nagasta or child of kings and taklawarda or bud of the rose a very handsome and spirited young womanwhose personal name is maquedaone of the names of the first known queens of sheba muttered higgsthe other was belchis</s> under pretence of attending her medically i went on for otherwisetheir wretched etiquette would scarcely have allowed me access to one soexalted i talked things over with her</s>  she told me that the idol ofthe fung is fashioned like a huge sphinx or so i gathered from herdescription of the thing for i have never seen it</s> what</s>  exclaimed higgs jumping up a sphinx in north central africa</s> well after all why not</s>  some of the earlier pharaohs are said to havehad dealings with that part of the world or even to have migrated fromit</s>  i think that the makreezi repeats the legend</s>  i suppose that it isramheaded</s> she told me also i continued that they have a tradition or rathera belief which amounts to an article of faith that if this sphinxor god which by the way is lion not ramheaded and is calledharmacharmac</s>  interrupted higgs again</s>  that is one of the names of thesphinxharmachis god of dawn</s> if this god i repeated should be destroyed the nation of the fungwhose forefathers fashioned it as they say must move away from thatcountry across the great river which lies to the south</s>  i have forgottenits name at the moment but i think it must be a branch of the nile</s> i suggested to her that in the circumstances her people had bettertry to destroy the idol</s>  maqueda laughed and said it was impossiblesince the thing was the size of a small mountain adding that the abatihad long ago lost all courage and enterprise and were content to sit intheir fertile and mountainringed land feeding themselves with tales ofdeparted grandeur and struggling for rank and highsounding titles tillthe day of doom overtook them</s> i inquired whether she were also content and she replied certainlynot but what could she do to regenerate her people she who wasnothing but a woman and the last of an endless line of rulers</s> rid me of the fung she added passionately and i will give yousuch a reward as you never dreamed</s>  the old cavecity yonder is full oftreasure that was buried with its ancient kings long

 are there no means by which this can bedone</s> there are means i replied and i tried to explain to her theproperties of dynamite and of other more powerful explosives</s>

a body however ancient we resumed ourdiscussion</s>  first of all at higgss suggestion i drew up a briefmemorandum of agreement which set out the objects of the expeditionand provided for the equal

desired neither treasurenor antiquities but only the rescue of my son</s>  the others pointed outhowever that like most people i might in future want somethingto live on or that if i did not in the event of his escape my boycertainly would so in the end i gave way</s> then captain orme very sensibly asked for a definition of our respectiveduties and it was settled that i was to be guide to the

opinion thedissentient was to loyally accept the decision of the majority</s> this curious document having been copied out fair i signed and passedit to the professor who hesitated a little but after

all our tremendous journey across the desert until we had passed theforest and reached the plains which surrounded the mountains of murthere are i think but few incidents with which the reader need betroubled</s>  the first of these was at assouan where a letter and varioustelegrams overtook captain orme which as by this time we had becomeintimate he showed to me</s>  they informed him that the clandestine infantwhom his uncle left behind him had suddenly sickened and died of somechildish ailment so that he was once again heir to the large propertywhich he thought he had lost since the widow

said i was going and i mean to go indeed isigned a document to that effect</s> i daresay i answered but circumstances alter cases</s>  if i might sayso an adventure that perhaps was good enough for a

lot toleave i suppose i had better make a will first and post it home whichis a bore</s> just then the professor came in followed by an arab thief of a dealerwith whom he was trying to bargain for some object of antiquity</s>  whenthe dealer had been ejected and the position explained to him higgswho whatever may be his failings in small matters is unselfish enoughin big ones said that he agreed with me and thought that under thecircumstances in his own interest orme ought to leave us and returnhome</s> you may save your breath old fellow answered the captain for thisreason if for no other and he threw him a letter across the tablewhich letter i saw afterwards</s>  to be brief it was from the younglady to whom he had been engaged to be married and who on his loss offortune had jilted him</s>  now she seemed to have changed her mindagain and although she did not mention the matter it is perhaps notuncharitable to suppose that the news of the death of the inconvenientchild

higgs after he had departed and for my parti am glad of it for somehow i think he will be a useful man among thosefung</s>  also if he went i expect that the sergeant would go too andwhere should we be without quick i should like to know</s> afterwards i conversed with the said quick about this same matterrepeating to him my opinions to which the sergeant listened with thedeference which he was always kind enough to show to me</s> begging your pardon sir he said when i had finished but i thinkyou are both right and wrong</s>  everything has two ends hasnt it</s>  yousay that it would be wicked for the captain to get himself killed therebeing now so much money for him to live for seeing that life is commonas dirt while money is precious rare and hard to come by</s>  it aintthe kings

theyd melt so one man dead gives another breadas the saying goes or praps i should say gingerbread in such cases</s> still on the whole sir i admit you are right as to the sinfulness ofwasting luck</s>  but now comes the other end</s>  i know this young lady whatthe captain was engaged to which he never would have been if he hadtaken my advice since of all the fishblooded little serpents that everi set eyes on shes the serpentest though pretty i allow</s>  solomon saidin his haste that an honest woman he had not found but if he had metthe honourable misswell never mind her namehed

has a couple of fins as well like that eel beasti caught in the nile</s>  one of them is that the captain promised and vowedto go through with this expedition and if a mans got to die hedbetter die honest without breaking his word</s>  and the other is whati said to you in london when i signed on that he wont die a minutebefore his time and nothing wont happen to him but whats boundto happen and therefore it aint a haporth of use bothering aboutanything and thats where the easts well ahead of the west</s> and now sir ill go and look after the camels and those halfbredjew boys what you call abati but i call rotten sneaks for if they gettheir thieving fingers into those canisters of picric salts thinkingtheyre jam as i found them trying to do yesterday something mayhappen in egypt thatll make the pharaohs turn in their graves and theten plagues look silly</s> so having finished his oration quick went and in due course westarted for mur</s> the second incident that is perhaps worth recording was an adventurethat happened to us when we had completed about two of our four monthsjourney</s> after weeks of weary desert travelif i remember right it was exactlya fortnight after the dog pharaoh of which i shall soon have plenty tosay had come into ormes possessionwe reached an oasis called zeuwhere i had halted upon my road down to egypt</s>  in this oasis whichalthough not large in extent possesses springs of beautiful water andgroves of datetrees we were as it chanced very welcome since wheni was there before i had been fortunate enough to cure its sheik ofan attack of ophthalmia and to doctor several of his people for variousailments with good results</s>  so although i was burning to get forward iagreed with the others that it would be wise to accede to the requestof the leader of our caravan a clever and resourceful but to my minduntrustworthy abati of the name of shadrach and camp in zeu for a weekor so to rest and feed our camels which had wasted almost to nothing onthe scant herbage of the desert</s> this shadrach i may add here whom his companions for some reasonunknown to me at that time called the cat was remarkable for a tripleline of scars upon his face which he informed me had been set thereby the claws of a lion</s>  now the great enemies of this people of zeu werelions which at certain seasons of the year i suppose when food grewscarce descended from the slopes of a range of hills that stretchedeast and west at a distance of about fifty miles north of the oasisand crossing the intervening desert killed many of the zeu sheepcamels and other cattle and often enough any of the tribe whom theycould catch</s>  as these poor zeus practically possessed no firearms theywere at the mercy of the lions which grew correspondingly bold</s>  indeedtheir only resource was to kraal their animals within stone walls atnight and take refuge in their huts which they seldom left betweensunset and dawn except to replenish the fires that they lit to scareany beast of prey which might be prowling through the town</s> though the lion season was now in full swing as it happened for thefirst five days of our stay at zeu we saw none of these great catsalthough in the darkness we heard them roaring in the distance</s>  on thesixth night however we were awakened by a sound of wailing which camefrom the village about a quarter of a mile away and when we went outat dawn to see what was the matter were met by a melancholy processionadvancing from its walls</s>  at the head of it marched the greyhaired oldchief followed by a number of screaming women who in their excitementor perhaps as a sign of mourning had omitted to make their toiletteand by four men who carried something horrid on a wickerwork door</s> soon we learned what had happened</s>  it seemed that hungry lions two orthree of them had broken through the palmleaf roof of the hut of oneof the sheiks wives she whose remains were stretched upon the doorand in addition to killing her had actually carried off his son</s> now he came to implore us white men who had guns to revenge him on thelions which otherwise having once tasted human flesh would destroymany more of his people</s> through an interpreter who knew arabic for not even higgs couldunderstand the peculiar zeu dialect he explained in excited andincoherent words that the beasts lay up among the sandhills not veryfar away where some thick reeds grew around a little spring of water</s> would we not come out and kill them and earn the blessing of the zeus</s> now i said nothing for the simple reason that having such big matterson hand although i was always fond of sport i did not wish any of usto be led off after these lions</s>  there is a time to hunt and a timeto cease from hunting and it seemed to me except for the purposes offood that this journey of ours was the latter</s>  however as i expectedoliver orme literally leaped at the idea</s>  so did higgs who of latehad been practising with a rifle and began to fancy himself a shot</s> he exclaimed loudly that nothing would give him greater pleasureespecially as he was sure that lions were in fact cowardly and overratedbeasts</s> from that moment i foreboded disaster in my heart</s>  still i said i wouldcome too partly because i had not shot a lion for many a day and hada score to settle with those beasts which it may be remembered nearlykilled me on the mountain of mur and partly because knowing the desertand also the zeu people much better than either the professor or orme ithought that i might possibly be of service</s> so we fetched our rifles and cartridges to which by an afterthought weadded two large waterbottles and ate a hearty breakfast</s>  as we werepreparing to start shadrach the leader of the abati cameldriversthat man with the scarred face who was nicknamed the cat came up to meand asked me whither we were going</s>  i told him whereon he saidwhat have you to do with these savages and their troubles lords</s>  ifa few of them are killed it is no matter but as you should know odoctor if you wish to hunt lions there are plenty in that land whitheryou travel seeing that the lion is the fetish of the fung and thereforenever killed</s>  but the desert about zeu is dangerous and harm may come toyou</s> then accompany us broke in the professor between whom and shadrachthere was no love lost for of course with you we should be quitesafe</s> not so he replied i and my people rest only madmen would go tohunt worthless wild beasts when they might rest</s>  have we not enough ofthe desert and its dangers as it is</s>  if you knew all that i do of lionsyou would leave them alone</s> of the desert we have plenty also but of shooting very littleremarked the captain who talked arabic well</s>  lie in your beds we goto kill the beasts that harass the poor people who have treated us sokindly</s> so be it said shadrach with a smile that struck me as malicious</s>  alion made thispointing to the dreadful threefold scar upon his face</s> may the god of israel protect you from lions</s>  remember lords thatthe camels being fresh again we march the day after tomorrow shouldthe weather hold for if the wind blows on yonder sandhills no man maylive among them and putting up his hand he studied the sky carefullyfrom beneath its shadow then with a grunt turned and vanished behinda hut</s> all this while sergeant quick was engaged at a little distance inwashing up the tin breakfast things to all appearance quite unconsciousof what was going on</s>  orme called him whereupon he advanced andstood to attention</s>  i remember thinking how curious he looked in thosesurroundingshis tall bony frame clothed in semimilitary garmentshis wooden face perfectly shaved his irongrey hair neatly parted andplastered down upon his head with pomade or some equivalent after theold private soldier fashion and his sharp ferretlike grey eyes takingin everything</s> are you coming with us sergeant</s>  asked orme</s> not unless ordered so to do captain</s>  i like a bit of hunting wellenough but with all three officers away some one should mount guardover the stores and transport so i think the dog pharaoh and i had beststop behind</s> perhaps you are right sergeant only tie pharaoh up or hell followme</s>  well what do you want to say</s>  out with it</s> only this captain</s>  although i have served in three campaigns amongthese here arabians to quick all african natives north of the equatorwere arabians and all south of it niggers i cant say i talk theirlingo well</s>  still i made out that the fellow they call cat dont likethis trip of yours and begging your pardon captain whatever else catmay be he aint no fool</s> cant help it sergeant</s>  for one thing it would never do to give in tohis fancies now</s> thats true captain</s>  when once its hoist right or wrong keep theflag flying and no doubt youll come back safe and sound if youremeant to</s> then having relieved his mind the sergeant ran his eye over ourequipment to see that nothing had been forgotten rapidly assuredhimself that the rifles were in working order reported all welland returned to his dishes</s>  little did any of us guess under whatcircumstances we should next meet with him</s> after leaving the town and marching for a mile or so along the oasisaccompanied by a mob of the zeus armed with spears and bows we wereled by the bereaved chief who also acted as tracker out into thesurrounding sands</s>  the desert here although i remembered it wellenough was different from any that we had yet encountered upon thisjourney being composed of huge and abrupt sandhills some of whichwere quite three hundred feet high separated from each other by deepwindcut valleys</s> for a distance while they were within reach of the moist air of theoasis these sandmountains produced vegetation of various sorts</s> presently however we passed out into the wilderness proper and fora while climbed up and down the steep shifting slopes till from thecrest of one of them the chief pointed out what in south africa iscalled a pan or vlei covered with green reeds and explained bysigns that in these lay the lions</s>  descending a steep declivity weposted ourselves i at the top and higgs and orme a little way downeither side of this vlei</s>  this done we dispatched the zeus to beatit out towards us for although the reeds grew thick along the courseof the underground water it was but a narrow place and not more than aquarter of a mile in length</s> scarcely had the beaters entered the tall reeds evidently withtrepidation for a good many of them held back from the adventurewhen a sound of loud wailing informed us that something had happened</s>  aminute or two later we saw two of them bearing away what appeared to bethe mangled remains of the chiefs son who had been carried off on theprevious night</s> just then too we saw something else for halfway down the marsha great male lion broke cover and began to steal off toward thesandhills</s>  it was about two hundred yards from higgs who chanced tobe nearest to it and therefore as any biggame hunter will know forpractical purposes far out of shot</s>  but the professor who was quiteunaccustomed to this or indeed any kind of sport and like allbeginners wildly anxious for blood lifted his rifle and fired as hemight have done at a rabbit</s>  by some marvellous accident the aim wasgood and the bullet from the express striking the lion fair behind theshoulder passed through its heart and knocked it over dead as a stone</s> by jingo</s>  did you see that</s>  screamed higgs in his delight</s>  thenwithout even stopping to reload the empty barrel he set off at the topof his speed toward the prostrate beast followed by myself and by ormeas fast as our astonishment would allow</s> running along the edge of the marsh higgs had covered about a hundredyards of the distance when suddenly charging straight at him out ofthe tall reeds appeared a second lion or rather lioness</s>  higgs wheeledround and wildly fired the left barrel of his rifle without touchingthe infuriated brute</s>  next instant to our horror we saw him uponhis back with the lioness standing over him lashing her tail andgrowling</s> we shouted as we ran and so did the zeus although they made no attemptat rescue with the result that the lioness instead of tearing higgsto pieces turned her head confusedly first to one side and then tothe other</s>  by now i who had a long start of orme was quite closesay within thirty yards though fire i dared not as yet fearing lestshould i do so i might kill my friend</s>  at this moment the lionessrecovering her nerves squatted down on the prostrate higgs and thoughhe hit at her with his fists dropped her muzzle evidently with theintention of biting him through the head</s> now i felt that if i hesitated any more all would be finished</s>  thelioness was much longer than higgsa short stout manand her hindquarters projected beyond his feet</s>  at these i aimed rapidly andpressing the trigger next second heard the bullet clap upon the greatbeasts hide</s>  up she sprang with a roar one hind leg dangling andafter a moments hesitation fled toward the sandhill</s> now orme who was behind me fired also knocking up the dust beneaththe lionesss belly but although he had more cartridges in his riflewhich was a repeater before either he or i could get another chanceit vanished behind a mound</s>  leaving it to go where it would we ran ontowards higgs expecting to find him either dead or badly mauledbut to our amazement and delight up jumped the professor his bluespectacles still on his nose and loading his rifle as he went chargedaway after the wounded lioness</s> come back shouted the captain as he followed</s> not for joe</s>  yelled higgs in his high voice</s>  if you fellows thinkthat im going to let a great cat sit on my stomach for nothing you arejolly well mistaken</s> at the top of the first rise the longlegged orme caught him butpersuade him to return was more than he or i when i arrived could do</s> beyond a scratch on his nose which had stung him and covered himwith blood we found that he was quite uninjured except in temper anddignity</s>  but in vain did we beg him to be content with his luck and thehonours he had won</s> why</s>  he answered adams wounded the beast and id rather kill twolions than one also i have a score to square</s>  but if you fellows areafraid you go home</s> well i confess i felt inclined to accept the invitation but orme whowas nettled repliedcome come that settles the question doesnt it</s>  you must be shakenby your fall or you would not talk like that higgs</s>  look here runsthe spoorsee the blood</s>  well lets go steady and keep our wind</s> we may come on her anywhere but dont you try any more long distanceshots</s>  you wont kill another lion at two hundred and fifty yards</s> all right said higgs dont be offended</s>  i didnt mean anythingexcept that i am going to teach that beast the difference between awhite man and a zeu</s> then we began our march following the blood tracks up and down thesteep sandslopes</s>  when we had been at it for about halfanhour ourspirits were cheered by catching sight of the lioness on a ridge fivehundred yards away</s>  just then too some of the zeus overtook us andjoined the hunt though without zeal</s> meanwhile as the day grew the heat increased until it was so intensethat the hot air danced above the sand slopes like billions of midgesand this although the sun was not visible being hidden by a sort ofmist</s>  a strange silence unusual even in the desert pervaded the earthand sky we could hear the grains of sand trickling from the ridges</s> the zeus who accompanied us grew uneasy and pointed upward with theirspears then behind toward the oasis of which we had long lost sight</s> finally when we were not looking they disappeared</s> now i would have followed them guessing that they had some good reasonfor this sudden departure</s>  but higgs refused to come and orme in whomhis foolish taunt seemed still to rankle only shrugged his shouldersand said nothing</s> let the black curs go exclaimed the professor as he polished his bluespectacles and mopped his face</s>  they are a whitelivered lot of sneaks</s> look</s>  there she is creeping off to the left</s>  if we run round thatsandhill we shall meet her</s> so we ran round the sandhill but we did not meet her although afterlong hunting we struck the blood spoor afresh and followed it forseveral miles first in this direction and then in that until orme andi wondered at higgss obstinacy and endurance</s>  at length when even hewas beginning to despair we put up the lioness in a hollow and firedseveral shots at her as she hobbled over the opposing slope one ofwhich hit her for she rolled over then picked herself up againroaring</s>  as a matter of fact it came from the captains rifle buthiggs who like many an inexperienced person was a jealous sportsmandeclared that it was his and we did not think it worth while tocontradict him</s> on we toiled and just beyond the ridge walked straight into thelioness sitting up like a great dog so injured that she could donothing but snarl hideously and paw at the air</s> now it is my turn old lady ejaculated higgs and straightwaymissed her clean from a distance of five yards</s>  a second shot was moresuccessful and she rolled over dead</s> come on said the exultant professor and well skin her</s>  she sat onme and i mean to sit on her for many a day</s> so we began the job although i who had large experience of thisdesert and did not like the appearance of the weather wished to leavethe beast where it lay and get back to the oasis</s>  it proved long fori was the only one of us who had any practical knowledge of flayinganimals and in that heat extremely unpleasant</s> at length it was done and having doubled the hide over a rifle for twoof us to carry in turns we refreshed ourselves from the waterbottlesi even caught the professor washing the blood off his face and handswith some of the precious fluid</s>  then we started for the oasis only todiscover though we were all sure that we knew the way that not oneof us had a slightest idea of its real direction</s>  in the hurry of ourdeparture we had forgotten to bring a compass and the sun that wouldhave been our guide in ordinary circumstances and to which we alwaystrusted in the open desert was hidden by the curious haze that has beendescribed</s> so sensibly enough we determined to return to the sand crest where wehad killed the lioness and then trace our own footprints backward</s>  thisseemed simple enough for there within halfamile rose the identicalridge</s> we reached it grumbling for the lionskin was heavy only to discoverthat it was a totally different ridge</s>  now after reflection andargument we saw our exact mistake and made for what was obviously thereal ridgewith the same result</s> we were lost in the desert</s> chapter ivthe death windthe fact is said higgs presently speaking with the air of an oraclethe fact is that all these accursed sandhills are as like each otheras mummy beads on the same necklace and therefore it is very difficultto know them apart</s>  give me that waterbottle adams i am as dry as alimekiln</s> no i said shortly you may be drier before the end</s>
what do you mean</s>  oh</s>  i see but thats nonsense those zeus will huntus up or at the worst we have only to wait till the sun gets out</s>
as he spoke suddenly the air became filled with a curious singing soundimpossible to describe caused as i knew who had often heard it beforeby millions and millions of particles of sand being rubbed together</s>  weturned to see whence it came and perceived far away rushing towardsus with extraordinary swiftness a huge and dense cloud preceded byisolated columns and funnels of similar clouds</s> a sandstorm said higgs his florid face paling a little</s>  bad luckfor us</s>  thats what comes of getting out of bed the wrong side firstthis morning</s>  no its your fault adams you helped me to salt lastnight in spite of my remonstrances the professor has sundry littlesuperstitions of this sort particularly absurd in so learned a man</s> well what shall we do</s>  get under the lee of the hill until it blowsover</s> dont suppose it will blow over</s>  cant see anything to do except sayour prayers remarked orme with sweet resignation</s>  oliver is i thinkthe coolest hand in an emergency of any one i ever met except perhapssergeant quick a man of course nearly old enough to be his father</s> the game seems to be pretty well up he added</s>  well you have killedtwo lions higgs and that is something</s> oh hang it</s>  you can die if you like oliver</s>  the world wont miss youbut think of its loss if anything happened to me</s>  i dont intend to bewiped out by a beastly sandstorm</s>  i intend to live to write a book onmur and higgs shook his fist at the advancing clouds with an air thatwas really noble</s>  it reminded me of ajax defying the lightning</s> meanwhile i had been reflecting</s> listen i said</s>  our only chance is to stop where we are for if wemove we shall certainly be buried alive</s>  look there is somethingsolid to lie on and i pointed to a ridge of rock a kind of core ofcongealed sand from which the surface had been swept by gales</s>  downwith you quick i went on and lets draw that lionskin over ourheads</s>  it may help to keep the dust from choking us</s>  hurry men itscoming</s> coming it was indeed with a mighty wailing roar</s>  scarcely had we gotourselves into position our backs to the blast and our mouths andnoses buried after the fashion of camels in a similar predicament thelionskin covering our heads and bodies to the middle with the pawstucked securely beneath us to prevent it from being blown away when thestorm leaped upon us furiously bringing darkness in its train</s>  therewe lay for hour after hour unable to see unable to talk because of theroaring noise about us and only from time to time lifting ourselvesa little upon our hands and knees to disturb the weight of sand thataccumulated on our bodies lest it should encase us in a living tomb</s> dreadful were the miseries we sufferedthe misery of the heat beneaththe stinking pelt of the lion the misery of the dustladen air thatchoked us almost to suffocation the misery of thirst for we could notget at our scanty supply of water to drink</s>  but worst of all perhapswas the pain caused by the continual friction of the sharp sand drivenalong at hurricane speed which incredible as it may seem finally woreholes in our thin clothing and filed our skins to rawness</s> no wonder the egyptian monuments get such a beautiful shine on them iheard poor higgs muttering in my ear again and again for he was growinglightheaded no wonder no wonder</s>  my shinbones will be very usefulto polish quicks tall ridingboots</s>  oh</s>  curse the lions</s>  why did youhelp me to salt you old ass why did you help me to salt</s>  its picklingme behind</s> then he became quite incoherent and only groaned from time to time</s> perhaps however this suffering did us a service since otherwiseexhaustion thirst and dust might have overwhelmed our senses andcaused us to fall into a sleep from which we never should have awakened</s> yet at the time we were not grateful to it for at last the agony becamealmost unbearable</s>  indeed orme told me afterwards that the last thinghe could remember was a quaint fancy that he had made a colossal fortuneby selling the secret of a new torture to the chinesethat of hot sanddriven on to the victim by a continuous blast of hot air</s> after a while we lost count of time nor was it until later that welearned that the storm endured for full twenty hours during the latterpart of which notwithstanding our manifold sufferings we must havebecome more or less insensible</s>  at any rate at one moment i rememberedthe awful roar and the stinging of the sand whips followed by a kindof vision of the face of my sonthat beloved longlost son whom i hadsought for so many years and for whose sake i endured all these things</s> then without any interval as it were i felt my limbs being scorchedas though by hot irons or through a burningglass and with a fearfuleffort staggered up to find that the storm had passed and that thefurious sun was blistering my excoriated skin</s>  rubbing the caked dirtfrom my eyes i looked down to see two mounds like those of graves outof which projected legs that had been white</s>  just then one pair of legsthe longer pair stirred the sand heaved up convulsively and utteringwandering words in a choky voice there arose the figure of oliver orme</s> for a moment we stood and stared at each other and strange spectacleswe were</s> is he dead</s>  muttered orme pointing to the still buried higgs</s> fear so i answered but well look and painfully we began todisinter him</s> when we came to it beneath the lionskin the professors face was blackand hideous to see but to our relief we perceived that he was notdead for he moved his hand and moaned</s>  orme looked at me</s> water would save him i said</s> then came the anxious moment</s>  one of our waterbottles was emptiedbefore the storm began but the other a large patent flask coveredwith felt and having a screw vulcanite top should still contain a goodquantity perhaps three quartsthat is if the fluid had not evaporatedin the dreadful heat</s>  if this had happened it meant that higgswould die and unless help came that soon we should follow him</s>  ormeunscrewed the flask for my hands refused that office and used histeeth to draw the cork which providentially enough the thoughtfulquick had set in the neck beneath the screw</s>  some of the water whichalthough it was quite hot had not evaporated thank god</s>  flew againsthis parched lips and i saw him bite them till the blood came in thefierceness of the temptation to assuage his raging thirst</s>  but heresisted it like the man he is and without drinking a drop handed methe bottle saying simplyyou are the oldest take care of this adams</s> now it was my turn to be tempted but i too overcame and sittingdown laid higgss head upon my knee then drop by drop let a littleof the water trickle between his swollen lips</s> the effect was magical for in less than a minute the professor sat upgrasped at the flask with both hands and strove to tear it away</s> you cruel brute</s>  you cruel selfish brute</s>  he moaned as i wrenched itfrom him</s> look here higgs i answered thickly orme and i want water badlyenough and we have had none</s>  but you might take it all if it would saveyou only it wouldnt</s>  we are lost in the desert and must be sparing</s> if you drank everything now in a few hours you would be thirsty againand die</s> he thought awhile then looked up and saidbeg pardoni understand</s>  im the selfish brute</s>  but theres a good lotof water there lets each have a drink we cant move unless we do</s> so we drank measuring out the water in a little indiarubber cup whichwe had with us</s>  it held about as much as a port wine glass and each ofus drank or rather slowly sipped three cupfuls we who felt as thoughwe could have swallowed a gallon apiece and asked for more</s>  small aswas the allowance it worked wonders in us we were men again</s> we stood up and looked about us but the great storm had changedeverything</s>  where there had been sandhills a hundred feet highnow were plains and valleys where there had been valleys appearedsandhills</s>
 only the high ridge upon which we had lain was as beforebecause it stood above the others and had a core of rock</s>  we tried todiscover the direction of the oasis by the position of the sun only tobe baffled since our two watches had run down and we did not know thetime of day or where the sun ought to be in the heavens</s>
 also inthat howling wilderness there was nothing to show us the points of thecompass</s> higgs whose obstinacy remained unimpaired whatever may have happenedto the rest of his vital forces had one view of the matter and ormeanother diametrically opposed to it</s>  they even argued as to whetherthe oasis lay to our right or to our left for their poor heads wereso confused that they were scarcely capable of accurate thought orobservation</s>  meanwhile i sat down upon the sand and considered</s>  throughthe haze i could see the points of what i thought must be the hillswhence the zeus declared that the lions came although of course foraught i knew they might be other hills</s> listen i said if lions live upon those hills there must be waterthere</s>  let us try to reach them perhaps we shall see the oasis as wego</s> then began our dreadful march</s>  the lionskin that had saved our livesand was now baked hard as a board we left behind but the rifles wetook</s>  all day long we dragged ourselves up and down steep sandslopespausing now again to drink a sip of water and hoping always that fromthe top of the next slope we should see a rescue party headed by quickor perhaps the oasis itself</s>  indeed once we did see it green andshining not more than three miles away but when we got to the head ofthe hill beyond which it should lie we found that the vision was onlya mirage and our hearts nearly broke with disappointment</s>  oh</s>  to mendying of thirst that mirage was indeed a cruel mockery</s> at length night approached and the mountains were yet a long way off</s> we could march no more and sank down exhausted lying on our facesbecause our backs were so cut by the driving sand and blistered bythe sun that we could not sit</s>  by now almost all our water was gone</s> suddenly higgs nudged us and pointed upwards</s>  following the line of hishand we saw not thirty yards away and showing clear against the skya file of antelopes trekking along the sandridge doubtless on a nightjourney from one pasturage to another</s> you fellows shoot he muttered i might miss and frighten them awayfor in his distress poor higgs was growing modest</s> slowly orme and i drew ourselves to our knees cocking our rifles</s>  bythis time all the buck save one had passed there were but six of themand this one marched along about twenty yards behind the others</s>  ormepulled the trigger but his rifle would not go off because as hediscovered afterwards some sand had worked into the mechanism of thelock</s> meanwhile i had also covered the buck but the sunset dazzled myweakened eyes and my arms were feeble also my terrible anxiety forsuccess since i knew that on this shot hung our lives unnerved me</s>  butit must be now or never in three more paces the beast would be down thedip</s> i fired and knowing that i had missed turned sick and faint</s>  theantelope bounded forward a few yards right to the edge of the dip thennever having heard such a sound before and being overcome by some fatalcuriosity stopped and turned around staring at the direction whence ithad come</s> despairingly i fired again almost without taking aim and this time thebullet went in beneath the throat and raking the animal dropped itdead as a stone</s>  we scrambled to it and presently were engaged in anawful meal of which we never afterwards liked to think</s>  happily for usthat antelope must have drunk water not long before</s> our hunger and thirst assuaged after this horrible fashion we sleptawhile by the carcase then arose extraordinarily refreshed and havingcut off some hunks of meat to carry with us started on again</s>  by theposition of the stars we now knew that the oasis must lie somewhere tothe east of us but as between us and it there appeared to be nothingbut these eternal sandhills stretching away for many miles and as infront of us toward the range the character of the desert seemed to bechanging we thought it safer if the word safety can be used in sucha connection to continue to head for that range</s>  all the remainder ofthis night we marched and as we had no fuel wherewith to cook it atdawn ate some of the raw meat which we washed down with the last dropsof our water</s> now we were out of the sandhills and had entered on a great pebblyplain that lay between us and the foot of the mountains</s>  these lookedquiet close but in fact were still far off</s>  feebly and ever more feeblywe staggered on meeting no one and finding no water though here andthere we came across little bushes of which we chewed the stringy andaromatic leaves that contained some moisture but drew up our mouths andthroats like alum</s> higgs who was the softest of us gave out the first though to thelast he struggled forward with surprising pluck even after he had beenobliged to throw away his rifle because he could no longer carry itthough this we did not notice at the time</s>  when he could not supporthimself upon his feet orme took him by one arm and i by the otherand helped him on much as i have seen two elephants do by a woundedcompanion of the herd</s> halfanhour or so later my strength failed me also</s>  although advancedin years i am tough and accustomed to the desert and hardships whowould not be who had been a slave to the khalifa</s>  but now i could do nomore and halting begged the others to go on and leave me</s>  ormes onlyanswer was to proffer me his left arm</s>  i took it for life is sweetto us all especially when one has something to live fora desireto fulfil as i had though to tell the truth even at the time i feltashamed of myself</s> thus then we proceeded awhile resembling a sober man attempting tolead two drunken friends out of reach of that stern policeman death</s> ormes strength must be wonderful or was it his great spirit and histender pity for our helplessness which enabled him to endure beneaththis double burden</s> suddenly he fell down as though he had been shot and lay theresenseless</s>  the professor however retained some portion of his mindalthough it wandered</s>  he became lightheaded and rambled on about ourmadness in having undertaken such a journey just to pot a couple ofbeastly lions and although i did not answer them i agreed heartilywith his remarks</s>  then he seemed to imagine that i was a clergyman andkneeling on the sand he made a lengthy confession of his sins whichso far as i gathered though i did not pay much attention to them fori was thinking of my own appeared chiefly to consist of the unlawfulacquisition of certain objects of antiquity or of having overmatchedothers in the purchase of such objects</s> to pacify him for i feared lest he should go raving mad i pronouncedsome religious absolution whereon poor higgs rolled over and lay stillby orme</s>  yes he the friend whom i had always loved for his veryfailings were endearing was dead or at the point of death like thegallant young man at his side and i myself was dying</s>  tremors shookmy limbs horrible waves of blackness seemed to well up from my vitalsthrough my breast to my brain and thence to evaporate in queer jaggedlines and patches which i realized but could not actually see</s>  gaymemories of my faroff childhood arose in me particularly those of achristmas party where i had met a little girl dressed like an elfa little girl with blue eyes whom i had loved dearly for quite afortnight to be beaten down stamped out swallowed by that visionof the imminent shadow which awaits all mankind the black womb of arebirth if rebirth there be</s> what could i do</s>  i thought of lighting a fire at any rate it wouldserve to scare the lions and other wild beasts which else might preyupon us before we were quite dead</s>  it would be dreadful to lie helplessbut sentient and feel their rending fangs</s>  but i had no strength tocollect the material</s>  to do so at best must have meant a long walk foreven here it was not plentiful</s>  i had a few cartridges leftthree tobe accuratein my repeating rifle the rest i had thrown away to be ridof their weight</s>  i determined to fire them since in my state i thoughtthey could no longer serve either to win food or for the purposes ofdefence although as it happened in this i was wrong</s>  it was possiblethat even in that endless desert some one might hear the shots and ifnotwell goodnight</s> so i sat up and fired the first cartridge wondering in a childishfashion where the bullet would fall</s>  then i went to sleep for awhile</s> the howling of a hyena woke me up and on glancing around i saw thebeasts flaming eyes quite close to me</s>  i aimed and shot at it andheard a yell of pain</s>  that hyena i reflected would want no more foodat present</s> the silence of the desert overwhelmed me it was so terrible that ialmost wished the hyena back for company</s>  holding the rifle above myhead i fired the third cartridge</s>  then i took the hand of higgs in myown for after all it was a linkthe last link with humanity and theworldand lay down in the company of death that seemed to fall upon mein black and smothering veils</s> i woke up and became aware that some one was pouring water down mythroat</s>  heaven</s>  i thought to myself for at that time heaven and waterwere synonymous in my mind</s>  i drank a good deal of it not all i wantedby any means but as much as the pourer would allow then raised myselfupon my hands and looked</s>  the starlight was extraordinarily clear inthat pure desert atmosphere and by it i saw the face of sergeantquick bending over me</s>  also i saw orme sitting up staring about himstupidly while a great yellow dog with a head like a mastiff lickedhis hand</s>  i knew the dog at once it was that which orme had boughtfrom some wandering natives and named pharaoh because he ruled over allother dogs</s>  moreover i knew the two camels that stood near by</s>  so i wasstill on earthunless indeed we had all moved on a step</s> how did you find us sergeant</s>  i asked feebly</s> didnt find you doctor answered quick dog pharaoh found you</s>  in abusiness like this a dog is more useful than man for he can smellwhat one cant see</s>  now if you feel better doctor please look at mr</s> higgs for i fear hes gone</s> i looked and although i did not say so was of the same opinion</s>  hisjaw had fallen and he lay limp and senseless his eyes i could not seebecause of the black spectacles</s> water i said and quick poured some into his mouth where itvanished</s> still he did not stir so i opened his garments and felt his heart</s> at first i could detect nothing then there was the slightest possibleflutter</s> theres hope i said in answer to the questioning looks</s>  you donthappen to have any brandy do you</s>  i added</s> never travelled without it yet doctor replied quick indignantlyproducing a metal flask</s> give him some i said and the sergeant obeyed with liberality andalmost instantaneous effect for higgs sat up gasping and coughing</s> brandy filthy stuff teetotaller</s>  cursed trick</s>  never forgive you</s> water water he spluttered in a thick low voice</s> we gave it to him and he drank copiously until we would let him haveno more indeed</s>  then by degrees his senses came back to him</s>  he thrustup his black spectacles which he had worn all this while and stared atthe sergeant with his sharp eyes</s> i understand he said</s>  so we are not dead after all which perhapsis a pity after getting through the beastly preliminaries</s>  what hashappened</s> dont quite know answered orme ask quick</s> but the sergeant was already engaged in lighting a little fire andsetting a campkettle to boil into which he poured a tin of beefextract that he had brought with other eatables from our stores on thechance that he might find us</s>  in fifteen minutes we were drinking soupfor i forbade anything more solid as yet and oh</s>  what a blessed mealwas that</s>  when it was finished quick fetched some blankets from thecamels which he threw over us</s> lie down and sleep gentlemen he said pharaoh and i will watch</s> the last thing i remember was seeing the sergeant in his own fashion anextremely religious man and not ashamed of it kneeling upon thesand and apparently saying his prayers</s>  as he explained afterwardsof course as a fatalist he knew well that whatever must happen wouldhappen but still he considered it right and proper to return thanks tothe power which had arranged that on this occasion the happenings shouldbe good and not ill a sentiment with which every one of us agreed</s> opposite to him with one of his faithful eyes fixed on orme satpharaoh in grave contemplation</s>  doubtless being an eastern dog heunderstood the meaning of public prayer or perhaps he thought that heshould receive some share of gratitude and thanks</s> when we awoke the sun was already high and to show us that we haddreamed no dream there was quick frying tinned bacon over the firewhile pharaoh sat still and watched himor the bacon</s> look said orme to me pointing to the mountains they are stillmiles away</s>  it was madness to think that we could reach them</s> i nodded then turned to stare at higgs who was just waking up forindeed he was a sight to see</s>  his fiery red hair was full of sand hisnether garments were gone apparently at some stage in our march he haddispensed with the remains of them because they chafed his sore limbsand his fair skin not excluding that of his face was a mass ofblisters raised by the sun</s>  in fact he was so disfigured that his worstenemy would not have known him</s>  he yawned stretched himself always agood sign in man or beast and asked for a bath</s> i am afraid you will have to wash yourself in sand here sir like themfilthy arabians said quick saluting</s>  no water to spare for baths inthis dry country</s>  but ive got a tube of hazeline also a hairbrush anda lookingglass he added producing these articles</s> quite so sergeant said higgs as he took them its sacrilege tothink of using water to wash</s>  i intend never to waste it in that wayagain</s>  then he looked at himself in the glass and let it fall upon thesand ejaculating oh</s>  good lord is that me</s> please be careful sir said the sergeant sternly you told me theother day that its unlucky to break a lookingglass also i have noother</s> take it away said the professor i dont want it any more anddoctor come and oil my face theres a good fellow yes and the restof me also if there is enough hazeline</s> so we treated each other with the ointment which at first made us smartfearfully and then very gingerly sat down to breakfast</s> now sergeant said orme as he finished his fifth pannikin of teatell us your story</s> there isnt much of a story captain</s>  those zeu fellows came backwithout you and not knowing the lingo i could make nothing of theirtale</s>  well i soon made shadrach and co</s>  understand that deathwind orno deathwindthats what they call itthey must come with me to lookfor you and at last we started although they said that i was madas you were dead already</s>  indeed it wasnt until i asked that fellowshadrach if he wanted to be dead tooand the sergeant tapped hisrevolver grimlythat he would let any one go</s> as it proved he was right for we couldnt find you and after awhilethe camels refused to face the storm any longer also one of the abatidrivers was lost and hasnt been heard of since</s>  it was all the restof us could do to get back to the oasis alive nor would shadrach go outagain even after the storm had blown itself away</s>  it was no use arguingwith the pig so as i did not want his blood upon my hands i took twocamels and started with the dog pharaoh for company</s> now this was my thought although i could not explain it to the abaticrowd that if you lived at all you would almost certainly head forthe hills as i knew you had no compass and you would not be able tosee anything else</s>  so i rode along the plain which stretches between thedesert and the mountains keeping on the edge of the sandhills</s>  i rodeall day but when night came i halted since i could see no more</s>  therei sat in that great place thinking and after an hour or two i observedpharaoh prick his ears and look toward the west</s>  so i also startedtoward the west and presently i thought that i saw one faint streakof light which seemed to go upward and therefore couldnt come from afalling star but might have come from a rifle fired toward the sky</s> i listened but no sound reached me only presently some secondsafterwards the dog again pricked his ears as though he heardsomething</s>  that settled me and i mounted and rode forward through thenight toward the place where i thought i had seen the flash</s>  for twohours i rode firing my revolver from time to time then as no answercame gave it up as a bad job and stopped</s>  but pharaoh there wouldntstop</s>  he began to whine and sniff and run forward and at last boltedinto the darkness out of which presently i heard him barking somehundreds of yards away to call me i suppose</s>  so i followed and foundyou three gentlemen dead as i thought at first</s>  thats all the storycaptain</s> one with a good end anyway sergeant</s>  we owe our lives to you</s> beg your pardon captain answered quick modestly not to me at allbut to providence first that arranged everything before we were bornperhaps and next to pharaoh</s>  hes a wise dog pharaoh though fiercewith some and you did a good deal when you bought him for a bottle ofwhisky and a sixpenny pocketknife</s> it was dawn on the following morning before we sighted the oasiswhither we could travel but slowly since owing to the lack of camelstwo of us must walk</s>  of these two as may be guessed the sergeant wasalways one and his master the other for of all the men i ever knew ithink that in such matters orme is the most unselfish</s>  nothing wouldinduce him to mount one of the camels even for halfanhour so thatwhen i walked the brute went riderless</s>  on the other hand once he wason notwithstanding the agonies he suffered from his soreness nothingwould induce higgs to get off</s> here i am and here i stop he said several times in english frenchand sundry oriental languages</s>  ive tramped it enough to last me therest of my life</s> both of us were dozing upon our saddles when suddenly i heard thesergeant calling to the camels to halt and asked what was the matter</s> looks like arabians doctor he said pointing to a cloud of dustadvancing toward us</s> well if so i answered our best chance is to show no fear and goon</s>  i dont think they will harm us</s> so having made ready such weapons as we had we advanced orme and thesergeant walking between the two camels until presently we encounteredthe other caravan and to our astonishment saw none other thanshadrach riding at the head of it mounted on my dromedary which hisown mistress the lady of the abati had given to me</s>  we came face toface and halted staring at each other</s> by the beard of aaron</s>  is it you lords</s>  he asked</s>  we thought youwere dead</s> by the hair of moses</s>  so i gather i answered angrily seeing thatyou are going off with all our belongings and i pointed to the baggagecamels laden with goods</s> then followed explanations and voluble apologies which higgs for oneaccepted with a very bad grace</s>  indeed as he can talk arabic and itsdialects perfectly he made use of that tongue to pour upon the heads ofshadrach and his companions a stream of eastern invective that must haveastonished them ably seconded as it was by sergeant quick in english</s> orme listened for some time then saidthatll do old fellow if you go on you will get up a row andsergeant be good enough to hold your tongue</s>  we have met them so thereis no harm done</s>  now friend shadrach turn back with us to the oasis</s> we are going to rest there for some days</s> shadrach looked sulky and said something about our turning and going onwith them whereon i produced the ancient ring shebas ring which ihad brought as a token from mur</s>  this i held before his eyes sayingdisobey and there will be an account to settle when you come into thepresence of her who sent you forth for even if we four should dieandi looked at him meaninglythink not that you will be able to hide thismatter there are too many witnesses</s> then without more words he saluted the sacred ring and we all wentback to zeu</s> chapter vpharaoh makes troubleanother six weeks or so had gone by and at length the character ofthe country began to change</s>  at last we were passing out of the endlessdesert over which we had travelled for so many hundreds of miles atleast a thousand according to our observations and reckonings which ichecked by those that i had taken upon my eastward journey</s>  our marchafter the great adventure at the oasis was singularly devoid ofstartling events</s>  indeed it had been awful in its monotony and yetoddly enough not without a certain charmat any rate for higgs andorme to whom the experience was new</s> day by day to travel on across an endless sea of sand so remote sounvisited that for whole weeks no man not even a wandering bedouin ofthe desert crossed our path</s>  day by day to see the great red sun riseout of the eastern sands and its journey finished sink into thewestern sands</s>  night by night to watch the moon the same moon on whichwere fixed the million eyes of cities turning those sands to a silversea or in that pure air to observe the constellations by which westeered our path making their majestic march through space</s>  and yet toknow that this vast region now so utterly lonesome and desolate hadonce been familiar to the feet of longforgotten men who had trod thesands we walked and dug the wells at which we drank</s> armies had marched across these deserts also and perished there</s>  foronce we came to a place where a recent fearful gale had almost denudedthe underlying rock and there found the skeletons of thousands uponthousands of soldiers with those of their beasts of burden and amongthem heads of arrows swordblades fragments of armour and of paintedwooden shields</s> here a whole host had died perhaps alexander sent it forth or perhapssome far earlier monarch whose name has ceased to echo on the earth</s> at least they had died for there we saw the memorial of that buriedenterprise</s>  there lay the kings the captains the soldiers and theconcubines for i found the female bones heaped apart some with thelong hair still upon the skulls showing where the poor affrightedwomen had hived together in the last catastrophe of slaughter or offamine thirst and driven sand</s>  oh if only those bones could speakwhat a tale was theirs to tell</s> there had been cities in this desert too where once were oases nowoverwhelmed except perhaps for a sandchoked spring</s>  twice we cameupon the foundations of such places old walls of clay or stone starkskeletons of ancient homes that the shifting sands had disinterredwhich once had been the theatre of human hopes and fears where once menhad been born loved and died where once maidens had been fair andgood and evil wrestled and little children played</s>  some job may havedwelt here and written his immortal plaint or some king of sodom andsuffered the uttermost calamity</s>  the world is very old all we westernslearned from the contemplation of these wrecks of men and of their workswas just that the world is very old</s> one evening against the clear sky there appeared the dim outline oftowering cliffs shaped like a horseshoe</s>  they were the mountains of murmany miles away but still the mountains of mur sighted at last</s>  nextmorning we began to descend through wooded land toward a wide river thatis i believe a tributary of the nile though upon this point i haveno certain information</s>  three days later we reached the banks of thisriver following some old road and faring sumptuously all the waysince here there was much game and grass in plenty for the camels thatafter their long abstinence ate until we thought that they would burst</s> evidently we had not arrived an hour too soon for now the mountains ofmur were hid by clouds and we could see that it was raining upon theplains which lay between us and them</s>  the wet season was setting inand had we been a single week later it might have been impossible forus to cross the river which would then have been in flood</s>  as it waswe passed it without difficulty by the ancient ford the water neverrising above the knees of our camels</s> upon its further bank we took counsel for now we had entered theterritory of the fung and were face to face with the real dangers ofour journey</s>  fifty miles or so away rose the fortress of mur but asi explained to my companions the question was how to pass those fiftymiles in safety</s>  shadrach was called to our conference and at myrequest set out the facts</s> yonder he said rose the impregnable mountain home of the abati butall the vast plain included in the loop of the river which he calledebur was the home of the savage fung race whose warriors could becounted by the ten thousand and whose principal city harmac wasbuilt opposite to the stone effigy of their idol that was also calledharmacharmacthat is harmachis god of dawn</s>  your fung had something todo with the old egyptians or both of them came from a common stockinterrupted higgs triumphantly</s> i daresay old fellow answered orme i think you told us that beforein london but we will go into the archology afterwards if we surviveto do so</s>  let shadrach get on with his tale</s> this city which had quite fifty thousand inhabitants continuedshadrach commanded the mouth of the pass or cleft by which we mustapproach mur having probably been first built there for that verypurpose</s> orme asked if there was no other way into the stronghold which heunderstood the embassy had left by being let down a precipice</s>  shadrachanswered that this was true but that although the camels and theirloads had been let down that precipitous place owing to the formationof its overhanging rocks it would be perfectly impossible to haul themup it with any tackle that the abati possessed</s> he asked again if there was not a way round if that circle of mountainshad no back door</s>  shadrach replied that there was such a back doorfacing to the north some eight days journey away</s>  only at this seasonof the year it could not be reached since beyond the mountains of murin that direction was a great lake out of which flowed the river eburin two arms that enclosed the whole plain of fung</s>  by now this lakewould be full swollen with rains that fell on the hills of northernafrica and the space between it and the mur range nothing but animpassable swamp</s> being still unsatisfied orme inquired whether if we abandoned thecamels we could not then climb the precipice down which the embassyhad descended</s>  to this the answer which i corroborated was that ifour approach were known and help given to us from above it might bepossible provided that we threw away the loads</s> seeing what these loads are and the purpose for which we have broughtthem so far that is out of the question said orme</s>  therefore tellus at once shadrach how we are to win through the fung to mur</s> in one way only o son of orme should it be the will of god that we doso at all by keeping ourselves hidden during the daytime and marchingat night</s>  according to their custom at this season tomorrow aftersunset the fung hold their great spring feast in the city of harmacand at dawn go up to make sacrifice to their idol</s>  but after sunsetthey eat and drink and are merry and then it is their habit to withdrawtheir guards that they may take part in the festival</s>  for this reasoni have timed our march that we should arrive on the night of this feastwhich i know by the age of the moon when in the darkness with godshelp perchance we may slip past harmac and at the first light findourselves in the mouth of the road that runs up to mur</s>  moreover i willgive warning to my people the abati that we are coming so that theymay be at hand to help us if there is need</s> how</s>  asked orme</s> by firing the reedsand he pointed to the dense masses of deadvegetation aboutas i arranged that i would do before we left mur manymonths ago</s>  the fung if they see it will think only that it is thework of some wandering fisherman</s> orme shrugged his shoulders sayingwell friend shadrach you know the place and these people and i donot so we must do what you tell us</s>  but i say at once that if as iunderstand yonder fung will kill us if they can to me your plan seemsvery dangerous</s> it is dangerous he answered adding with a sneer but i thought thatyou men of england were not cowards</s> cowards</s>  you son of a dog</s>  broke in higgs in his high voice</s>  howdare you talk to us like that</s>  you see this man hereand he pointed tosergeant quick who tall and upright stood watching this scene grimlyand understanding most of what passedwell he is the lowest amongusa servant only here the sergeant saluted but i tell you thatthere is more courage in his little finger than in your whole body orin that of all the abati people so far as i can make out</s> here the sergeant saluted again murmuring beneath his breath ihope so sir</s>  being a christian i hope so but till it comes to thestickingpoint one can never be sure</s> you speak big words o higgs answered shadrach insolently for as ithink i have said he hated the professor who smelt the rogue in himand scourged him continually with his sharp tongue but if the fung gethold of you then we shall learn the truth</s> shall i punch his head sir</s>  queried quick in a meditative voice</s> be quiet please interrupted orme</s>  we have troubles enough beforeus without making more</s>  it will be time to settle our quarrels when wehave got through the fung</s> then he turned to shadrach and saidfriend this is no time for angry words</s>  you are the guide of thisparty lead us as you will remembering only that if it comes to war iby the wish of my companions am captain</s>  also there is another thingwhich you should not forgetnamely that in the end you must makeanswer to your own ruler she who i understand from the doctor here iscalled walda nagasta the child of kings</s>  now no more words we marchas you wish and where you wish</s>  on your head be it</s> the abati heard and bowed sullenly</s>  then with a look of hate at higgshe turned and went about his business</s> much better to have let me punch his head soliloquized quick</s>  itwould have done him a world of good and perhaps saved many troublesfor to tell the truth i dont trust that quarterbred hebrew</s> then he departed to see to the camels and the guns while the rest of uswent to our tents to get such sleep as the mosquitoes would allow</s>  inmy own case it was not much since the fear of evil to come weighed uponme</s>  although i knew the enormous difficulty of entering the mountainstronghold of mur by any other way such as that by which i had quittedit burdened as we were with our long train of camels laden with riflesammunition and explosives i dreaded the results of an attempt to passthrough the fung savages</s> moreover it occurred to me that shadrach had insisted upon thisroute from a kind of jealous obstinacy and to be in opposition to usenglishmen whom he hated in his heart or perhaps for some dark andsecret reason</s>  still the fact remained that we were in his power sinceowing to the circumstances in which i had entered and left the place itwas impossible for me to act as guide to the party</s>  if i attempted to doso no doubt he and the abati with him would desert leaving the camelsand their loads upon our hands</s>  why should they not seeing thatthey would be quite safe in concluding that we should never have anopportunity of laying our side of the case before their ruler</s> just as the sun was setting quick came to call me saying that thecamels were being loaded up</s> i dont much like the look of things doctor he said as he helped meto pack my few belongings for the fact is i cant trust that shadrachman</s>  his pals call him cat a good name for him i think</s>  also he isshowing his claws just now the truth being that he hates the lot of usand would like to get back into purr or mur or whatever the name of theplace is having lost us on the road</s>  you should have seen the way helooked at the professor just now</s>  oh</s>  i wish the captain had let mepunch his head</s>  im sure it would have cleared the air a lot</s> as it chanced shadrach was destined to get his head punched afterall but by another hand</s>  it happened thus</s>  the reeds were fired asshadrach had declared it was necessary to do in order that the abatiwatchmen on the distant mountains might see and report the signalalthough in the light of subsequent events i am by no means certain thatthis warning was not meant for other eyes as well</s>  then as arranged westarted out leaving them burning in a great sheet of flame behindus and all that night marched by the shine of the stars along somebrokendown and undoubtedly ancient road</s> at the first sign of dawn we left this road and camped amid theovergrown ruins of a deserted town that had been built almost beneaththe precipitous cliffs of mur fortunately without having met any one orbeing challenged</s>  i took the first watch while the others turned in tosleep after we had all breakfasted off cold meats for here we dared notlight a fire</s>
 below us not more than fifteen or sixteen milesaway and clearly visible through my fieldglasses lay the great townof harmac which during my previous visit to this land i had neverseen as i passed it in the night</s> it was a city of the west central african type with open marketplacesand wide streets containing thousands of white flatroofed houses themost important of which were surrounded by gardens</s>  round it ran a highand thick wall built apparently of sunburnt brick and in front ofthe gateways of which i could see two stood square towers whence thesemight be protected</s>  all about this city the flat and fertile land wasunder cultivation for the season being that of early spring alreadythe maize and other crops showed green upon the ground</s>
beyond this belt of ploughlands with the aid of the fieldglasses icould make out great herds of grazing cattle and horses mixed with wildgame a fact that assured me of the truth of what i had heard duringmy brief visit to mur that the fung had few or no firearms sinceotherwise the buck and quagga would have kept at a distance</s>  far offtoo and even on the horizon i saw what appeared to be other towns andvillages</s>  evidently this was a very numerous people and one which couldnot justly be described as savage</s>  no wonder that the little abati tribefeared them so intensely notwithstanding the mighty precipices by whichthey were protected from their hate</s> about eleven oclock orme came on watch and i turned in having nothingto report</s>  soon i was fast asleep notwithstanding the anxieties thathad i been less weary might well have kept me wakeful</s>  for these weremany</s>  on the coming night we must slip through the fung and beforemidday on the morrow we should either have entered mur or failed tohave entered mur which meantdeath or what was worse captivityamong barbarians and subsequent execution preceded probably by tortureof one sort or another</s> of course however we might come thither without accident travellingwith good guides on a dark night for after all the place was big andthe road lonely and little used so that unless we met a watch whichwe were told would not be there our little caravan had a good chanceto pass unobserved</s>  shadrach seemed to think that we should do so butthe worst of it was that like quick i did not trust shadrach</s>  evenmaqueda the lady of the abati she whom they called child of kings hadher doubts about him or so it had seemed to me</s> at any rate she had told me before i left mur that she chose him forthis mission because he was bold and cunning one of the very few of herpeople also who in his youth had crossed the desert and thereforeknew the road</s>  yet physician she added meaningly watch him foris he not named cat</s>  yes watch him for did i not hold his wife andchildren hostages and were i not sure that he desires to win the greatreward in land which i have promised to him i would not trust you tothis mans keeping</s> well after many experiences in his company my opinion coincided withmaquedas and so did that of quick no mean judge of men</s> look at him doctor he said when he came to tell me that i could turnin for whether it were his watch or not the sergeant never seemed tobe off duty</s>  look at him and he pointed to shadrach who was seatedunder the shade of a tree talking earnestly in whispers with two of hissubordinates with a very curious and unpleasing smile upon his face</s>  ifgod almighty ever made a scamp hes squatting yonder</s>  my belief is thathe wanted to be rid of us all at zeu so that he might steal our goodsand i hope he wont play the same trick again tonight</s>  even the dogcant abide him</s> before i could answer i had proof of this last statement for the greatyellow hound pharaoh that had found us in the desert hearing ourvoices emerged from some corner where it was hidden and advancedtoward us wagging its tail</s>  as it passed shadrach it stopped andgrowled the hair rising on its back whereon he hurled a stone at itand hit its leg</s>  next instant pharaoh a beast of enormous power was onthe top of him and really i thought about to tear out his throat</s> well we got him off before any harm was done but shadrachs facelined with its livid scars was a thing to remember</s>  between rage andfear it looked like that of a devil</s> to return</s>  after this business i went to sleep wondering if it were mylast rest upon the earth and whether having endured so much for hissake it would or would not be my fortune to see the face of my sonagain if indeed he still lived yonder not a score of miles awayoranywhere</s> toward evening i was awakened by a fearful hubbub in which idistinguished the shrill voice of higgs ejaculating language which iwill not repeat the baying of pharaoh and the smothered groans andcurses of an abati</s>  running from the little tent i saw a curioussight that of the professor with shadrachs head under his left armin chancery as we used to call it at school while with his right hepunched the said shadrachs nose and countenance generally with all hisstrength which i may add is considerable</s>  close by holding pharaohby the collar which we had manufactured for him out of the skin of acamel that had died stood sergeant quick a look of grim amusementon his wooden face while around gesticulating after their easternfashion and uttering guttural sounds of wrath were several of theabati drivers</s>  orme was absent being in fact asleep at the time</s> what are you doing higgs</s>  i shouted</s> cantyousee he spluttered accompanying each word with a blow onthe unfortunate shadrachs prominent nose</s>  i am punching this fellowsbeastly head</s>  ah</s>  youd bite would you</s>  then take that and thatandthat</s>  lord how hard his teeth are</s>  well i think he has hadenough and suddenly he released the abati who a gory and mostunpleasant spectacle fell to the ground and lay there panting</s>  hiscompanions seeing their chiefs melancholy plight advanced upon theprofessor in a threatening fashion indeed one of them drew a knife</s> put up that thing sonny said the sergeant or by heaven ill loosethe dog upon you</s>  got your revolver handy doctor</s> evidently if the man did not understand quicks words their purportwas clear to him for he sheathed his knife and fell back with theothers</s>  shadrach too rose from the ground and went with them</s>  at adistance of a few yards however he turned and glaring at higgs outof his swollen eyes saidbe sure accursed gentile that i will remember and repay</s> at this moment too orme arrived upon the scene yawning</s> what the deuce is the matter</s>  he asked</s> id give five bob for a pint of iced stone ginger replied higgsinconsequently</s>  then he drank off a pannikin of warmish muddycolouredwater which quick gave to him and handed it back sayingthanks sergeant thats better than nothing and cold drink is alwaysdangerous if you are hot</s>  whats the matter</s>  oh</s>  not much</s>  shadrachtried to poison pharaoh thats all</s>  i was watching him out of thecorner of my eye and saw him go to the strychnine tin roll a bit ofmeat in it which he had first wetted and throw it to the poor beast</s> i got hold of it in time and chucked it over that wall where you willfind it if you care to look</s>  i asked shadrach why he had done such athing</s>  he answered to keep the dog quiet while we are passing throughthe fung adding that anyhow it was a savage beast and best out of theway as it had tried to bite him that morning</s>  then i lost my temper andwent for the blackguard and although i gave up boxing twenty years agovery soon had the best of it for as you may have observed no orientalcan fight with his fists</s>  thats all</s>  give me another cup of watersergeant</s> i hope it may be answered orme shrugging his shoulders</s>  to tell thetruth old fellow it would have been wiser to defer blacking shadrachseyes till we were safe in mur</s>  but its no use talking now and idaresay i should have done the same myself if i had seen him try topoison pharaoh and he patted the head of the great dog of which wewere all exceedingly fond although in reality it only cared for ormemerely tolerating the rest of us</s> doctor he added perhaps you would try to patch up our guides noseand soothe his feelings</s>  you know him better than we do</s>  give him arifle</s>  no dont do that or he might shoot some one in the backbyaccident done on purpose</s>  promise him a rifle when we get into mur iknow he wants one badly because i caught him trying to steal a carbinefrom the case</s>  promise him anything so long as you can square it up</s> so i went taking a bottle of arnica and some court plaster with me tofind shadrach surrounded by sympathizers and weeping with rage overthe insult which he said had been offered to his ancient anddistinguished race in his own unworthy person</s>  i did my best for himphysically and mentally pointing out as i dabbed the arnica onhis sadly disfigured countenance that he had brought the trouble onhimself seeing that he had really no business to poison pharaoh becausehe had tried to bite him</s>  he answered that his reason for wishing tokill the dog was quite different and repeated at great length what hehad told the professornamely that it might betray us while we werepassing through the fung</s>  also he went on so venomously about revengethat i thought it time to put a stop to the thing</s> see here shadrach i said unless you unsay those words and makepeace at once you shall be bound and tried</s>  perhaps we shall have abetter chance of passing safely through the fung if we leave you deadbehind us than if you accompany us as a living enemy</s> on hearing this he changed his note altogether saying that he sawhe had been wrong</s>  moreover so soon as his injuries were dressed hesought out higgs whose hand he kissed with many apologies vowing thathe had forgotten everything and that his heart toward him was like thatof a twin brother</s> very good friend answered higgs who never bore malice only donttry to poison pharaoh again and for my part ill promise not toremember this matter when we get to mur</s> quite a converted character aint he doctor</s>  sarcastically remarkedquick who had been watching this edifying scene</s>  nasty eastern temperall gone no hebrew talk of eye for eye or tooth for tooth but kissesthe fist that smote him in the best christian spirit</s>  all the same iwouldnt trust the swine further than i could kick him especially inthe dark which he added meaningly is what it will be tonight</s> i made no answer to the sergeant for although i agreed with him therewas nothing to be done and talking about a bad business would only makeit worse</s> by now the afternoon drew towards nighta very stormy night to judgefrom the gathering clouds and rising wind</s>  we were to start a littleafter sundown that is within an hour and having made ready my ownbaggage and assisted higgs with his we went to look for orme and quickwhom we found very busy in one of the rooms of an unroofed house</s>  to allappearance they were engaged quick in sorting pound tins of tobaccoor bakingpowder and orme in testing an electric battery and carefullyexamining coils of insulated wire</s> whats your game</s>  asked the professor</s> better than yours old boy when satan taught your idle hands to punchshadrachs head</s>  but perhaps you had better put that pipe out</s>  theseazoimide compounds are said to burn rather more safely than coal</s> still one never knows the climate or the journey may have changedtheir constitution</s> higgs retreated hurriedly to a distance of fifty yards indeed whencehe returned having knocked out his pipe and even left his matches on astone</s> dont waste time in asking questions said orme as the professorapproached with caution</s>  ill explain</s>  we are going on a queer journeytonightfour white men with about a dozen halfbred mongrel scamps ofdoubtful loyalty so you see quick and i thought it as well to have someof this stuff handy</s>  probably it will never be wanted and if wanted weshall have no time to use it still who knows</s>  there that will do</s>  tencanisters enough to blow up half the fung if they will kindly sit onthem</s>  you take five quick a battery and three hundred yards of wireand ill take five a battery and three hundred yards of wire</s>  yourdetonators are all fixed arent they</s>  well so are mine and withoutmore words he proceeded to stow away his share of the apparatus in thepoacher pockets of his coat and elsewhere while quick did likewise withwhat remained</s>  then the case that they had opened was fastened up againand removed to be laden on a camel</s> chapter vihow we escaped from harmacas finally arranged this was the order of our march first went an abatiguide who was said to be conversant with every inch of the way</s>  thencame orme and sergeant quick conducting the camels that were loadedwith the explosives</s>  i followed in order to keep an eye upon theseprecious beasts and those in charge of them</s>  next marched some morecamels carrying our baggage provisions and sundries and finally inthe rear were the professor and shadrach with two abati</s> shadrach i should explain had selected this situation for the reasonas he said that if he went first after what had passed any mistake oruntoward occurrence might be set down to his malice whereas if he werebehind he could not be thus slandered</s>  on hearing this higgs who isa generous soul insisted upon showing his confidence in the virtue ofshadrach by accompanying him as a rearguard</s>  so violently did he insistand so flattered did shadrach seem to be by this mark of faith thatorme who i should say if i have not already done so was in solecommand of the party now that hostilities were in the air consented tothe plan if with evident reluctance</s> as i know his own view was that it would be best for us four englishmento remain together although if we did so whatever position we choseit would be impossible for us in that darkness to keep touch with theline of camels and their loads which were almost as important to us asour lives</s>  at least having made up our minds to deliver them in mur wethought that they were important perhaps because it is the fashionof the anglosaxon race to put even a selfcreated idea of duty beforepersonal safety or convenience</s> rightly or wrongly so things were settled for in such troublousconditions one can only do what seems best at the moment</s>  criticismsubsequent to the event is always easy as many an unlucky commander hasfound out when the issue went awry but in emergency one must decide onsomething</s>
 westarted quite unobserved so far as we could tell and travellingdownward from the overgrown ruined town gained the old road and incomplete silence for the feet of camels make no noise passed along ittoward the lights of harmac which now and again when the stormcloudslifted we saw glimmering in front of us and somewhat to our left</s> in all my long wanderings i cannot remember a more exciting or a moredisagreeable journey</s>  the blackness relieved only from time to time bydistant lightnings was that of the plagues of egypt the driving rainworked through the openings of our camelhair cloaks and the waterproofswe wore underneath them and wet us through</s>  the cold damp wind chilledus to the bone enervated as we were with the heat of the desert</s> but these discomforts and they were serious enough we forgot in thetremendous issue of the enterprise</s>  should we win through to mur</s>  or asa crown to our many labours and sufferings should we perish presentlyon the road</s>  that was the question as i can assure the reader one thatwe found very urgent and interesting</s> three hours had gone by</s>  now we were opposite to the lights of harmacalso to other lights that shone up a valley in the mountain to ourright</s>  as yet everything was well for this we knew by the wordswhispered up and down the line</s> then of a sudden in front of us a light flashed although as yet itwas a long way off</s>  next came another whispered message of halt</s>  so wehalted and presently one of the front guides crept back informing usthat a body of fung cavalry had appeared upon the road ahead</s>  we tookcounsel</s>  shadrach arrived from the rear and said that if we waitedawhile they might go away as he thought that their presence must beaccidental and connected with the great festival</s>  he implored us to bequite silent</s>  accordingly not knowing what to do we waited</s> now i think i have forgotten to say that the dog pharaoh to preventaccidents occupied a big basket this basket in which he often rodewhen tired being fixed upon one side of ormes camel</s>  here he laypeaceably enough until in an unlucky moment shadrach left me to goforward to talk to the captain whereon smelling his enemy pharaohburst out into furious baying</s>  after that everything was confusion</s> shadrach darted back toward the rear</s>  the light ahead began to movequickly advancing toward us</s>  the front camels left the road as ipresume following their leader according to the custom of these beastswhen marching in line</s> presently i know not how orme quick and myself found ourselvestogether in the darkness at the time we thought higgs was with us alsobut in this we were mistaken</s>  we heard shoutings and strange voicesspeaking a language that we could not understand</s>  by the sudden glare ofa flash of lightning for the thunderstorm was now travelling overus we saw several things</s>  one of these was the professorsridingdromedary which could not be mistaken because of its pure whitecolour and queer method of holding its head to one side passing withinten yards between us and the road having a man upon its back whoevidently was not the professor</s>  then it was that we discovered hisabsence and feared the worst</s> a fung has got his camel i said</s> no answered quick shadrach has got it</s>  i saw his ugly mug againstthe light</s> another vision was that of what appeared to be our baggage camels movingswiftly away from us but off the road which was occupied by a body ofhorsemen in white robes</s>  orme issued a brief order to the effect that wewere to follow the camels with which the professor might be</s>  we startedto obey but before we had covered twenty yards of the cornfield orwhatever it was in which we were standing heard voices ahead that werenot those of abati</s>  evidently the flash which showed the fung to us haddone them a like service and they were now advancing to kill or captureus</s> there was only one thing to doturn and flyand this we did headingwhither we knew not but managing to keep touch of each other</s> about a quarter of an hour later just as we were entering a grove ofpalms or other trees which hid everything in front of us the lightningblazed again though much more faintly for by this time the storm hadpassed over the mountains of mur leaving heavy rain behind it</s>  by theflash i who was riding last and as it chanced looking back over myshoulder saw that the fung horsemen were not fifty yards behind andhunting for us everywhere their line being extended over a long front</s> i was however sure that they had not yet caught sight of us in thedense shadow of the trees</s> get on i said to the others they will be here presently and heardquick addgive your camel his head captain he can see in the dark and perhapswill take us back to the road</s> orme acted on this suggestion which as the blackness round us waspitchy seemed a good one</s>  at any rate it answered for off we went at afair pace the three camels marching in line first over soft groundand afterwards on a road</s>  presently i thought that the rain had stoppedsince for a few seconds none fell on us but concluded from the echo ofthe camels feet and its recommencement that we had passed under somearchway</s>  on we went and at length even through the gloom and rain i sawobjects that looked like houses though if so there were no lights inthem perhaps because the night drew toward morning</s>  a dreadful ideastruck me we might be in harmac</s>  i passed it up for what it was worth</s> very likely whispered orme back</s>  perhaps these camels were bredhere and are looking for their stables</s>  well there is only one thingto dogo on</s> so we went on for a long while only interfered with by the occasionalattentions of some barking dog</s>
 luckily of these pharaoh in his baskettook no heed probably because it was his habit if another dog barked athim to pretend complete indifference until it came so near that hecould spring and fight or kill it</s>  at length we appeared to pass underanother archway after which a hundred and fifty yards or so furtheron the camels came to a sudden stop</s>  quick dismounted and presently iheard him saydoors</s>  can feel the brasswork on them</s>  tower above i think and wallon either side</s>  seem to be in a trap</s>  best stop here till light comes</s> nothing else to be done</s> accordingly we stopped and having tied the camels to each other toprevent their straying took shelter from the rain under the tower orwhatever it might be</s>  to pass away the time and keep life in us for wewere almost frozen with the wet and cold we ate some tinned food andbiscuits that we carried in our saddlebags and drank a dram of brandyfrom quicks flask</s>  this warmed us a little though i do not think thata bottleful would have raised our spirits</s>  higgs whom we all loved wasgone dead probably by that time the abati had lost or desertedus and we three white men appeared to have wandered into a savagestronghold where as soon as we were seen we should be trapped likebirds in a net and butchered at our captors will</s>  certainly theposition was not cheerful</s> overwhelmed with physical and mental misery i began to doze orme grewsilent and the sergeant having remarked that there was no need tobother since what must be must be consoled himself in a corner byhumming over and over again the verse of the hymn which begins  there is a blessed home beyond this land of woe  where trials never come nor tears of sorrow flow</s> fortunately for us shortly before dawn the tears of sorrow asrepresented by the rain ceased to flow</s>  the sky cleared showing thestars suddenly the vault of heaven was suffused with a wonderful andpearly light although on the earth the mist remained so thick that wecould see nothing</s>  then above this sea of mist rose the great ball ofthe sun but still we could see nothing that was more than a few yardsaway from us</s> there is a blessed home beyond this land of woedroned quick beneath his breath for about the fiftieth time sinceapparently he knew no other hymn which he considered suitable to ourcircumstances then ejaculated suddenlyhullo</s>  heres a stair</s>  with your leave ill go up it captain and hedid</s> a minute later we heard his voice calling us softlycome here gentlemen he said and see something worth looking at</s> so we scrambled up the steps and as i rather expected found ourselvesupon the top of one of two towers set above an archway which towerswere part of a great protective work outside the southern gates of acity that could be none other than harmac</s>  soaring above the mist rosethe mighty cliffs of mur that almost exactly opposite to us werepierced by a deep valley</s> into this valley the sunlight poured revealing a wondrous andaweinspiring object of which the base was surrounded by billowyvapours a huge couchant animal fashioned of black stone with a headcarved to the likeness of that of a lion and crowned with the uraeusthe aspcrested symbol of majesty in old egypt</s>  how big the creaturemight be it was impossible to say at that distance for we were quite amile away from it but it was evident that no other monolithicmonument that we had ever seen or heard of could approach its colossaldimensions</s> compared to this tremendous effigy indeed the boasted sphinx of gizehseemed but a toy</s>  it was no less than a small mountain of rock shaped bythe genius and patient labour of some departed race of men to the formof a lionheaded monster</s>  its majesty and awfulness set thus above therolling mists in the red light of the morning reflected on it from thetowering precipices beyond were literally indescribable even in ourmiserable state they oppressed and overcame us so that for awhile wewere silent</s>  then we spoke each after his own mannerthe idol of the fung</s>  said i</s>  no wonder that savages should take itfor a god</s> the greatest monolith in all the world muttered orme and higgs isdead</s>  oh</s>  if only he had lived to see it he would have gone happy</s>  iwish it had been i who was taken i wish it had been i</s>  and he wrunghis hands for it

meantazoimides are pretty active but it will take a lot of stirring ifever we get there</s>  seems a pity too for the old pussy is handsome inhis way</s> come down said orme</s>  we must find out where we are perhaps we canescape in the mist</s> one moment i answered</s>  do you see that</s>  and i pointed to aneedlelike rock that pierced the fog about a mile to the south of theidol valley and say two miles from where we were</s>  thats the whiterock it isnt white really but the vultures roost on it and make itlook so</s>  i have never seen it before for i passed it in the night buti know that it marks the beginning of the cleft which runs up to muryou remember shadrach told us so</s>  well if we can get to that whiterock we have a chance of life</s> orme studied it hurriedly and repeated come down we may be seen uphere</s> we descended and began our investigations in feverish haste</s>  this wasthe sum of them in the arch under the tower were set two great doorscovered with plates of copper or bronze beaten into curious shapes torepresent animals and men and apparently very ancient</s>  these huge doorshad grilles in them through which their defenders could peep out orshoot arrows</s>  what seemed more important to us however was that theylacked locks being secured only by thick bronze bolts and bars such aswe could undo</s> lets clear out before the mist lifts said orme</s>  with luck we mayget to the pass</s> we assented and i ran to the camels that lay resting just outside thearch</s>  before i reached them however quick called me back</s> look through there doctor he said pointing to one of thepeepholes</s> i did so and in the dense mist saw a body of horsemen advancing towardthe door</s> they must have seen us on the top of the wall</s>  fools that we were to gothere</s>  exclaimed orme</s> next instant he started back not a second too soon for through thehole where his face had been flashed a spear which struck the groundbeyond the archway</s>  also we heard other spears rattle upon the bronzeplates of the doors</s> no luck</s>  said orme thats all up they mean to break in</s>  now i thinkwe had better play a bold game</s>  got your rifles sergeant and doctor</s> yes</s>  then choose your loopholes aim and empty the magazines intothem</s>  dont waste a shot</s>  for heavens sake dont waste a shot</s> nowonetwothree fire</s> fire we did into the dense mass of men who had dismounted and wererunning up to the doors to burst them open</s>  at that distance we couldscarcely miss and the magazines of the repeating rifles held five shotsapiece</s>  as the smoke cleared away i counted quite halfadozen fungdown while some others were staggering off wounded</s>  also several ofthe men and horses beyond were struck by the bullets which had passedthrough the bodies of the fallen</s> the effect of this murderous discharge was instantaneous and remarkable</s> brave though the fung might be they were quite unaccustomed to magazinerifles</s>  living as they did perfectly isolated and surrounded by a greatriver even if they had heard of such things and occasionally seen anold gaspipe musket that reached them in the course of trade of modernguns and their terrible power they knew nothing</s>  small blame to themtherefore if their courage evaporated in face of a form of suddendeath which to them must have been almost magical</s>  at any rate they fledincontinently leaving their dead and wounded on the ground</s> now again we thought of flight which perhaps would have proved ourwisest course but hesitated because we could not believe that the funghad left the road clear or done more than retreat a little to waitfor us</s>  while we lost time thus the mist thinned a great deal so muchindeed that we could see our exact position</s>  in front of us towards thecity side lay a wide open space whereof the walls ended againstthose of harmac itself to which they formed a kind of vestibule orantechamber set there to protect this gateway of the town through whichwe had ridden in the darkness not knowing whither we went</s> those inner doors are open said orme nodding his head toward thegreat portals upon the farther side of the square</s>  lets go see if wecan shut them</s>  otherwise we shant hold this place long</s> so we ran across to the further doors that were similar to those throughwhich we had just fired only larger and as we met nobody to interferewith our efforts found that the united strength of the three of us wasjust only just sufficient to turn first one and then the other ofthem upon its hinges and work the various bolts and bars into theirrespective places</s>  two men could never have done the job but beingthree and fairly desperate we managed it</s>  then we retreated to ourarchway and as nothing happened took the opportunity to eat and drinka few mouthfuls quick remarking sagely that we might as well die uponfull as upon empty stomachs</s> when we had crossed the square the fog was thinning rapidly but as thesun rose sucking the vapours from the rainsoaked earth it thickenedagain for awhile</s> sergeant said orme presently these black men are bound to attackus soon</s>  now is the time to lay a mine while they cant see what we areafter</s> i was just thinking the same thing captain the sooner the betterreplied quick</s>  perhaps the doctor will keep a watch here over thecamels and if he sees any one stick up his head above the wall hemight bid him goodmorning</s>  we know he is a nice shot is the doctorand he tapped my rifle</s> i nodded and the two of them set out laden with wires and the packagesthat looked like tobacco tins heading for a stone erection in thecentre of the square which resembled an altar but was i believe arostrum whence the native auctioneers sold slaves and other merchandise</s> what they did there exactly i am sure i do not know indeed i was toomuch occupied in keeping a watch upon the walls whereof i couldclearly see the crest above the mist to pay much attention to theirproceedings</s> presently my vigilance was rewarded for over the great gatewayopposite at a distance of about a hundred and fifty paces from meappeared some kind of a chieftain clad in white robes and wearing a veryfine turban or coloured headdress who paraded up and down waving aspear defiantly and uttering loud shouts</s> this man i covered very carefully lying down to do so</s>  as quick hadsaid i am a good rifle shot having practised that art for many yearsstill one may always miss which although i bore no personal grudgeagainst the poor fellow in the fine headdress on this occasion i didnot wish to do</s>  the sudden and mysterious death of that savage would ifelt sure produce a great effect among his people</s> at length he stopped exactly over the door and began to execute a kindof wardance turning his head from time to time to yell out somethingto others on the farther side of the wall</s>  this was my opportunity</s>  icovered him with as much care as though i were shooting at a targetwith one bulls eye to win</s>
 the cartridge explodedthe bullet went on its way and the man on the wall stopped dancing andshouting and stood quite still</s>  clearly he had heard the shot or feltthe wind of the ball but was

three or four timeshe whirled thus with incredible rapidity then suddenly threw his armswide and dived headlong from the wall like a bather from a plank butbackward and was soon no more</s>  only from the farther side of thosegates arose a wail of wrath and consternation</s> after this no other fung appeared upon the wall so i turned myattention to the spyhole in the doors behind me and seeing somehorsemen moving about at a distance of four or five hundred yards on arocky ridge where the mist did not lie i opened fire on them and at thesecond shot was fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle</s>  oneof those with him who must have been a brave fellow instantly jumpeddown threw him dead or living over the horse leaped up behind himand galloped away accompanied by the others pursued by some probablyineffective bullets that i sent after them</s> now the road to the pass of mur seemed to be clear and i regretted thatorme and quick were not with me to attempt escape</s>  indeed i meditatedfetching or calling them when suddenly i saw them returning buryinga wire or wires in the sand as they came and at the same time hearda noise of thunderous blows of which i could not mistake the meaning</s> evidently the fung were breaking down the farther bronze doors with somekind of batteringram</s>  i ran out to meet them and told my news</s> well done said orme in a quiet voice</s>  now sergeant just join upthose wires to the battery and be careful to screw them in tight</s>  youhave tested it havent you</s>  doctor be good enough to unbar the gates</s> no you cant do

do</s>  i asked as i obeyed</s> show them some fireworks i hope</s>  bring the camels into the archwayso that they cant foul the wire with their feet</s>  sostand still yougrumbling brutes</s>  now for these bolts</s>  heavens</s>  how stiff they are</s>  iwonder why the fung dont grease them</s>  one door will donever mind theother</s> labouring furiously we got it undone and ajar</s>  so far as we could seethere was no one in sight beyond</s>  scared by our bullets or for otherreasons of their own the guard there appeared to have moved away</s> shall we take the risk and ride for it</s>  i suggested</s> no answered orme</s>  if we do even supposing there are no fung waitingbeyond the rise those inside the town will soon catch us on their swifthorses</s>  we must scare them before we bolt and then those that are leftof them may let us alone</s>  now listen to me</s>  when i give the word youtwo take the camels outside and make them kneel about fifty yardsaway not nearer for i dont know the effective range of these newexplosives it may be greater than i think</s>  i shall wait until the fungare well over the mine and then fire it after which i hope to join you</s> if i dont ride as hard as you can go to that white rock and if youreach mur give my compliments to the child of kings or whatever she iscalled and say that although i have been prevented from waiting uponher sergeant quick understands as much about picrates as i do</s>  alsoget shadrach tried and hanged if he is guilty of higgss death</s>  poor oldhiggs</s>  how he would have enjoyed this</s> beg your pardon captain said quick but ill stay with you</s>  thedoctor can see to the baggage animals</s> will you be good enough to obey orders and fall to the rear when youare told sergeant</s>  now no words</s>  it is necessary for the purposes ofthis expedition that one of us two should try to keep a whole skin</s> then sir pleaded quick maynt i take charge of the battery</s> no he answered sternly</s>  ah</s>  the doors are down at last and hepointed to a horde of fung mounted and on foot who poured through thegateway where they had stood shouting after their fashion and went onnow then pick out the captains and pepper away</s>  i want to keep themback a bit so that they come on in a crowd not scattered</s> we took up our repeating rifles and did as orme told us and so densewas the mass of humanity opposite that if we missed one man we hitanother killing or wounding a number of them</s>  the result of the loss ofseveral of their leaders to say nothing of meaner folk was justwhat orme had foreseen</s>  the fung soldiers instead of rushing onindependently spread to right and left until the whole farther side ofthe square filled up with thousands of them a veritable sea of men atwhich we pelted bullets as boys hurl stones at a wave</s> at length the pressure of those behind thrust onward those in frontand the whole fierce tumultuous mob began to flow forward across thesquare a multitude bent on the destruction of three white men armedwith these new and terrible weapons</s>  it was a very strange and thrillingsight never have i seen its like</s> now said orme stop firing and do as i bid you</s>  kneel the camelsfifty yards outside the wall not less and wait till you know the end</s> if we shouldnt meet again well goodbye and good luck</s> so we went quick literally weeping with shame and rage</s> good lord</s>  he exclaimed good lord</s>  to think that after fourcampaigns samuel quick sergeant of engineers with five medals shouldlive to be sent off with the baggage like a potbellied bandmasterleaving his captain to fight about three thousand niggers singlehanded</s> doctor if he dont come out you do the best you can for yourself forim going back to stop with him thats all</s>  there thats fifty pacesdown you go you ugly beasts and he bumped his camel viciously on thehead with the butt of his rifle</s> from where we had halted we could only see through the archway into thespace beyond</s>  by now the square looked like a great sunday meeting inhyde park being filled up with men of whom the first rows were alreadypast the altarlike rostrum in its centre</s> why dont he loose off them stingingbees</s>  muttered quick</s>  oh</s>  i seehis little game</s>  look and he pointed to the figure of orme who hadcrept behind the unopened half of the door on our side of it and waslooking intently round its edge holding the battery in his right hand</s> he wants to let them get nearer so as to make a bigger bag</s>  hei heard no more of quicks remarks for suddenly something like anearthquake took place and the whole sky seemed to turn to one greatflame</s>  i saw a length of the wall of the square rush outward and upward</s> i saw the shut half of the bronzeplated door skipping and hoppingplayfully toward us and in front of it the figure of a man</s>  then itbegan to rain all sorts of things</s> for instance stones none of which hit us luckily and other moreunpleasant objects</s>  it is a strange experience to be knocked backwardby a dead fist separated from its parent body yet on this occasion thisactually happened to me and what is more the fist had a spear in it</s> the camels tried to rise and bolt but they are phlegmatic brutes andas ours were tired as well we succeeded in quieting them</s> whilst we were thus occupied somewhat automatically for the shock haddazed us the figure that had been propelled before the dancing doorarrived reeling in a drunken fashion and through the dust and fallingdbris we knew it for that of oliver orme</s>  his face was blackened hisclothes were torn half off him and blood from a scalp wound ran downhis brown hair</s>  but in his right hand he still held the little electricbattery and i knew at once that he had no limbs broken</s> very successful mine he said thickly</s>  boer melinite shells arentin it with this new compound</s>  come on before the enemy recover from theshock and he flung himself upon his camel</s> in another minute we had started at a trot toward the white rock whilstfrom the city of harmac behind us rose a wail of fear and misery</s>  wegained the top of the rise on which i had shot the horseman and asi expected found that the fung had posted a strong guard in the dipbeyond out of reach of our bullets in order to cut us off shouldwe attempt to escape</s>  now terrified by what had happened to thema supernatural catastrophe they were escaping themselves for weperceived them galloping off to the left and right as fast as theirhorses would carry them</s> so for awhile we went on unmolested though not very quickly because oformes condition</s>  when we had covered about half the distance between usand the white rock i looked round and became aware that we were beingpursued by a body of cavalry about a hundred strong which i supposedhad emerged from some other gate of the city</s> flog the animals i shouted to quick or they will catch us afterall</s> he did so and we advanced at a shambling gallop the horsemen gainingon us every moment</s>  now i thought that all was over especially when ofa sudden from behind the white rock emerged a second squad of horsemen</s> cut off</s>  i exclaimed</s> suppose so sir answered quick but these seem a different crowd</s> i scanned them and saw that he was right</s>  they were a very differentcrowd for in front of them floated the abati banner which i could notmistake having studied it when i was a guest of the tribe acurious triangular green flag

eventsof that morning clearly they had no stomach left for a fight with asuperior force</s> the lady in white rode up to us</s> greetings friend she exclaimed to me for she knew me again at once</s> now who is captain among you</s> i pointed to the shattered orme who sat swaying on his camel with eyeshalf closed</s> noble sir she said addressing him if you can tell me what hashappened</s>  i am

finished translating</s>  but i must consult my council</s> where is my uncle the prince joshua</s> here lady answered a voice from the press behind out of whichpresently emerged mounted on a white horse a stout man well advancedin middle age with a swarthy complexion and remarkably round prominenteyes</s>  he was clad in the usual eastern robes richly worked over whichhe wore a shirt of

hes a perfect devil with a trumpet</s> what does your companion say</s>  asked maqueda again</s> i translated the middle part of ormes remarks but neither thecommencement nor the end but even these amused her very much for sheburst out laughing and said pointing to harmac over which still hunga cloud of dustyes yes joshua my uncle the walls of jericho are down and thequestion is will you not take your opportunity</s>  so in an hour or two weshall be dead or if god goes with us perhaps free from the menace ofthe fung for years</s> the prince joshua stared at her with his great prominent

up</s>  can five hundred men stand against tens ofthousands</s> it seems that three stood against them this morning and worked somedamage my uncle but it is true those three are of a different

now here and there a voice cried i will or some gorgeously dressedperson stepped forward in a hesitating way and that was all</s> you see men of the west</s>  said maqueda after a little pauseaddressing us three</s>  i thank you for the great deeds that you havedone and for your counsel</s>  but i cannot take it because my people arenotwarlike and she covered her face with her hands</s> now there arose a great tumult among her followers who all began totalk at once</s>  joshua in particular drew a large sword and waved itshouting out a recital of the desperate actions of his youth and thenames of fung chieftains whom he alleged he had killed in single combat</s> told you that fat cur was a firstclass trumpeter said ormelanguidly while the sergeant ejaculated in tones of deep disgustgood lord</s>  what a set</s>  why doctor they aint fit to savage a refereein a london football ground</s>  pharaoh there in his basket where he wasbarking loudly would make the whole

the prince who ifhe did not understand quicks words at any rate caught their meaningwonderfully well did as he was told and fell back</s> just then indeed there was a general movement up the pass in thewide mouth of which all this scene took place for suddenly three fungchieftains appeared galloping toward us one of whom was veiled witha napkin in which were cut eyeholes</s>  so universal was this retreatin fact that we three on our camels and the child of kings on herbeautiful mare found ourselves left alone</s> an embassy said maqueda scanning the advancing horsemen who carriedwith them a white flag tied to the blade of a spear</s>  physician willyou and your friends come with me and speak to these messengers</s>  andwithout even waiting for an answer she rode forward fifty yards or soon to the plain and there reined up and halted till we could bringour camels round and join her</s>  as we did so the three fungsplendidlooking blackfaced fellows arrived at a furious galloptheir lances pointed at us</s> stand still friends said maqueda they mean no harm</s> as the words passed her lips the fung pulled the horses to theirhaunches arabfashion lifted spears and saluted</s>  then theirleadernot the veiled man but anotherspoke in a dialect that i whohad spent so many years among the savages of the desert understood wellenough especially as the base of it was arabic</s> o walda nagasta daughter of solomon he said we are the tongues ofour sultan barung son of barung for a hundred generations and we speakhis words to the brave white men who are your guests</s>  thus says barung</s> like the fat one whom i have already captured you white men are heroes</s> three of you alone you held the gate against my army</s>  with the weaponsof the white man you killed us from afar here one and there one</s>  thenat last with a great magic of thunder and lightning and earthquake yousent us by scores into the bosom of our god and shook down our wallsabout our ears and out of that hell you escaped yourselves</s> now o white men this is the offer of barung to you leave the cursof the abati the baboons who gibber and deck themselves out therockrabbits who seek safety in the cliffs and come to him</s>  he willgive you not only life but all your hearts desirelands and wivesand horses great shall you be in his councils and happy shall you live</s> moreover for your sakes he will try to spare your brother the fat onewhose eyes look out of black windows who blows fire from his mouth andreviles his enemies as never man did before</s>  yes although the priestshave doomed him to sacrifice at the next feast of harmac he will try tospare him which perhaps he can do by making him like the singer ofegypt also a priest of harmac and thus dedicate forever to the godwith whom indeed he says he had been familiar for thousands of years</s> this is our message o white men</s> now when i had translated the substance of this oration to orme andquick for as i saw by the quiver that passed through her at thefung insults upon her tribe maqueda understood it their tonguesnot differing greatly orme who for the time at any rate was almosthimself again saidtell these fellows to say to their sultan that he is a good old boyand that we thank him very much also that we are sorry to have beenobliged to kill so many of them in a way that he must have thoughtunsportsmanlike but we had to do it as we are sure he will understandin order to save our skins</s>  tell him also that speaking personallyhaving sampled the abati yonder and on our journey i should like toaccept his invitation</s>  but although as yet we have found no men amongthem only as he says baboons rockrabbits and boasters withouta fight in them we haveand here he bowed his bleeding head tomaquedafound a woman with a great heart</s>  of her salt we have eatenor are about to eat to serve her we have come from far upon her camelsand unless she should be pleased to accompany us we cannot deserther</s> all of this i rendered faithfully while every one and especiallymaqueda listened with much attention</s>  when they had considered ourwords the spokesman of the messengers replied to the effect that themotives of our decision were of a nature that commanded their entirerespect and sympathy especially as their people quite concurred in ourestimate of the character of the abati ruler child of kings</s>  thisbeing so they would amend their proposition knowing the mind of theirsultan and having indeed plenipotentiary powers</s> lady of mur he went on addressing maqueda directly fair daughterof the great god harmac and a mortal queen what we have offered tothe white lords your guests we offer to you also</s>  barung our sultanshall make you his head wife or if that does not please you you shallwed whom you willand perhaps by accident the envoys roving eyesrested for a moment upon oliver orme</s> leave then your rockrabbits who dare not quit their cliffs when butthree messengers wait without with sticks and he glanced at the spearin his hand and come to dwell among men</s>  listen high lady we knowyour case</s>  you do your best in a hopeless task</s>  had it not been for youand your courage mur would have been ours three years ago and it wasours before your tribe wandered thither</s>  but while you can find but ahundred brave warriors to help you you think the place impregnableand you have perhaps that number though we know they are not here theyguard the gates above</s>  yes with a few of your mountaineers whose heartsare as those of their forefathers were so far as you have defied allthe power of the fung and when you saw that the end drew near usingyour womans wit you sent for the white men to come with their magicpromising to pay them with the gold which you have in such plenty in thetombs of our old kings and in the rocks of the mountains</s> who told you that o tongue of barung</s>  asked maqueda in a lowvoice speaking for the first time</s>  the man of the west whom you tookprisonerhe whom you call fat one</s> no no o walda nagasta the lord black windows has told us nothing asyet except sundry things about the history of our god with whom as wesaid he seems to be familiar and to whom therefore we vowed him atonce</s>  but there are others who tell us things for in times of truceour peoples trade together a little and cowards are often spies</s>  forinstance we knew that these white men were coming last night though itis true that we did not know of their fire magic for had we done sowe should not have let the camels slip through since there may be moreof it on themfor your comfort learn that there ismuch more i interrupted</s> ah</s>  replied the tongue shaking his head sadly and yet we sufferedcat whom you call shadrach to make off with that of your fat brotheryes and even gave it to him after his own beast had been lamed byaccident</s>  well it is our bad luck and without doubt harmac is angrywith us today</s>  but your answer o walda nagasta your answer o rose ofmur</s> what can it be o voices of barung the sultan</s>  replied maqueda</s>  youknow that by my blood and by my oath of office i am sworn to protect murto the last</s> and so you shall pleaded the tongue for when we have cleaned it ofbaboons and rockrabbits which if you were among us we soon shoulddo and thus fulfilled our oath to regain our ancient secret city of therocks we will set you there once more as its lady under barung andgive you a multitude of subjects of whom you may be proud</s> it may not be o tongue for they would be worshippers of harmac andbetween jehovah whom i serve and harmac there is war she answeredwith spirit</s> yes sweetsmelling bud of the rose there is war and let it beadmitted that the first battle has gone against harmac thanks to themagic of the white men</s>  yet yonder he sits in his glory as the spiritshis servants fashioned him in the beginning and he pointed with hisspear toward the valley of the idol</s>  you know our prophecythat untilharmac rises from his seat and flies away for where he goes the fungmust followtill then i say we shall hold the plains and the city ofhis namethat is for ever</s> for ever is a long word o mouth of barung</s>  then she paused a littleand added slowly did not certain of the gates of harmac fly farthis morning</s>  now what if your god should follow his gates and thoseworshippers who went with them and be seen no more</s>  or what if theearth should open and swallow him so that he goes down to hell whitheryou cannot follow</s>  or what if the mountains should fall together andbury him from your sight eternally</s>  or what if the lightnings shouldleap out and shatter him to dust</s> at these ominous words the envoys shivered and it seemed to me thattheir faces for a moment turned grey</s> then o child of kings answered the spokesman solemnly the fungwill acknowledge that your god is greater than our god and that ourglory is departed</s> thus he spoke and was silent turning his eyes toward the thirdmessenger he who wore a cloth or napkin upon his head that was piercedwith eyeholes and hung down to the breast</s>  with a quick motion the mandragged off this veil and threw it to the ground revealing a very noblecountenance not black like that of his followers but coppercoloured</s> he was about fifty years of age with deepset flashing eyes hookednose and a flowing grizzled beard</s>  the collar of gold about his neckshowed that his rank was high but when we noticed a second ornamentof gold also upon his brow we knew that it must be supreme</s>  for thisornament was nothing less than the symbol of royalty once worn by theancient pharaohs of egypt the double snakes of the uraeus bendingforward as though to strike which as we had seen rose also from thebrow of the lionheaded sphinx of harmac</s> as he uncovered his two companions leapt to the ground and prostratedthemselves before him crying barung</s>  barung</s>  while all three of usenglishmen saluted involuntarily i think and even the child of kingsbowed</s> the sultan acknowledged our greetings by raising his spear</s>  then hespoke in a grave measured voiceo walda nagasta and you white men sons of great fathers i havelistened to the talk between you and my servants i confirm their wordsand i add to them</s>  i am sorry that my generals tried to kill you lastnight</s>  i was making prayer to my god or it should not have happened</s>  ihave been well repaid for that deed since an army should not make warupon four men even though by their secret power four men can defeat anarmy</s>  i beseech you and you also rose of mur to accept my profferedfriendship since otherwise ere long you will soon be dead and yourwisdom will perish with you for i am weary of this little war against ahandful whom we despise</s> o walda nagasta you have breathed threats against the majesty ofharmac but he is too strong for you nor may the might that can turn afew bricks to dust and shatter the bones of men prevail against him whois shaped from the heart of a mountain and holds the spirit of eternity</s> so at least i think but even if it is decreed otherwise what will thatavail you</s>  if it should please the god to leave us because of your artsthe fung will still remain to avenge him ere they follow</s>  then i swearto you by my majesty and by the bones of my ancestors who sit in thecaves of mur that i will spare but one of the abati jews yourself ochild of kings because of your great heart and the three white menyour guests should they survive the battle because of their courageand their wisdom</s>  as for their brother black windows whom i havecaptured he must be sacrificed since i have sworn it unless youyield when i will plead for his life to the god with what result icannot tell</s>  yield then and i will not even slay the abati theyshall live on and serve the fung as slaves and minister to the glory ofharmac</s>

known more of you butmayhap we shall meet again in war</s>  farewell</s> she ceased and i could see that she was watching us intently throughher thin veil</s>  the sultan also watched us stroking his long beard alook of speculation in his eyes for evidently this play interested himand he wondered how it would end</s> this wont do said orme when he understood the thing</s>  higgs wouldnever forgive us if we ate dirt just on the offchance of saving himfrom sacrifice</s>  hes too straightminded on big things</s>  but of coursedoctor he added jerkily you have interests of your own and mustdecide for yourself</s>  i think i can speak for the sergeant</s> i have decided i answered</s>  i hope that my son would never forgive meeither but if it is otherwise why so it must be</s>  also barung has madeno promises about him</s> tell him then said orme</s>  my head aches infernally and i want to goto bed above ground or under it</s> so i told him although to speak the truth i felt like a man with aknife in his heart for it was bitter to come so near to the desire ofyears to the love of life and then to lose all hope just because ofduty to the head woman of a pack of effete curs to whom one had chancedto make a promise in order to gain this very end</s>  if we could havesurrendered with honour at least i should have seen my son whom now imight never see again</s> one thing however i added on the spur of the momentnamely a requestthat the sultan would tell the professor every word that had passed inorder that whatever happened to him he might know the exact situation</s> my harmac said barung when he had heard how disappointed should ihave been with you if you had answered otherwise when a woman showed youthe way</s>  i have heard of you english beforearabs and traders broughtme tales of you</s>  for instance there was one who died defending a cityagainst a worshipper of the prophet who called himself a prophet downyonder at khartoum on the nilea great death they told me a greatdeath which your people avenged afterwards</s> well i did not quite believe the story and i wished to judge of it byyou</s>  i have judged white lords i have judged and i am sure that yourfat brother black windows will be proud of you even in the lionsjaws</s>  fear not he shall hear every word</s>  the singer of egypt who itappears can talk his tongue shall tell the tale to him and make asong of it to be sung over your honourable graves</s>  and now farewell mayit be my lot to cross swords with one of you before all is done</s>  thatshall not be yet for you need rest especially yonder tall son of a godwho is wounded and he pointed to orme</s>  child of kings with a heart ofkings permit me to kiss your hand and to lead you back to your peoplethat i would were more worthy of you</s>  ah</s>  yes i would that we wereyour people</s> maqueda stretched out her hand and taking it the sultan barelytouched her fingers with his lips</s>  then still holding them he rodewith her toward the pass</s> as we approached its mouth where the abati were crowded togetherwatching our conference i heard them murmur the sultan the sultanhimself</s>  and saw the prince joshua mutter some eager words to theofficers about him</s> look out doctor said quick into my ear</s>  unless im mistook thatporpoise is going to play some game</s> hardly were the words out of his mouth when uttering the most valiantshouts and with swords drawn joshua and a body of his companionsgalloped up and surrounded our little group</s> now yield barung bellowed joshua yield or die</s> the sultan stared at him in astonishment then answeredif i had any weapon he had thrown down his lance when he took maquedaby the hand certainly one of us should die o hog in mans clothes</s> then he turned to maqueda and added child of kings i knew thesepeople of yours to be cowardly and treacherous but is it thus that yousuffer them to deal with envoys under a flag of peace</s> not so not so she cried</s>  my uncle joshua you disgrace me youmake our people a shame a hissing and a reproach</s>  stand back let thesultan of the fung go free</s> but they would not the prize was too great to be readily disgorged</s> we looked at each other</s>  not at all the game said orme</s>  if theycollar him we shall be tarred with their extremely dirty brush</s>  shoveyour camel in front sergeant and if that beggar joshua tries anytricks put a bullet through him</s> quick did not need to be told twice</s>  banging his dromedarys ribs withthe butt end of his rifle he drove it straight on to joshua shoutingout of the light porpoise</s>  with the result that the princes horsetook fright and reared up so high that its rider slid off over its tailto find himself seated on the ground a sorry spectacle in his gorgeousrobes and armour</s> taking advantage of the confusion which ensued we surrounded the sultanand escorted him out of the throng back to his two companions whoseeing that there was something amiss were galloping toward us</s> i am your debtor said barung but o white men make me more so</s> return i pray you to that hog in armour and say that barung sultanof the fung understands from his conduct that he desires to challengehim to single combat and that seeing he is fully armed the sultanalthough he wears no mail awaits him here and now</s> so i went at once with the message</s>  but joshua was far too clever to bedrawn into any such dangerous adventure</s> nothing he said would have given him greater joy than to hack the headfrom the shoulders of this dog of a gentile sheik</s>  but unhappily owingto the conduct of one of us foreigners he had been thrown from hishorse and hurt his back so that he could scarcely stand much lessfight a duel</s> so i returned with my answer whereat barung smiled and said nothing</s> only taking from his neck a gold chain which he wore he proffered itto quick who as he said had induced the prince joshua to show hishorsemanship if not his courage</s>  then he bowed to us one by one andbefore the abati could make up their mind whether to follow him or notgalloped off swiftly with his companions toward harmac</s>
such was our introduction to barung sultan of the fung a barbarianwith many good points among them courage generosity and appreciationof those qualities even in a foe characteristics that may have beenintensified by the blood of his mother who i am told was an arabof high lineage captured by the fung in war and given as a wife to thefather of barung</s> chapter viiithe shadow of fateour ride from the plains up the pass that led to the high tableland ofmur was long and in its way wonderful enough</s>  i doubt whether in thewhole world there exists another home of men more marvellously defendedby nature</s>  apparently the road by which we climbed was cut in the firstinstance not by human hands but by the action of primval floodspouring perhaps from the huge lake which doubtless once covered thewhole area within the circle of the mountains although today it isbut a moderatesized sheet of water about twenty miles long by ten inbreadth</s>  however this may be the old inhabitants had worked on it themarks of their tools may still be seen upon the rock</s> for the first mile or two the road is broad and the ascent so gentlethat my horse was able to gallop up it on that dreadful night whenafter seeing my sons face accident or rather providence enabled meto escape the fung</s>  but from the spot where the lions pulled the poorbeast down its character changes</s>  in places it is so narrow thattravellers must advance in single file between walls of rock hundredsof feet high where the sky above looks like a blue ribbon and even atmidday the path below is plunged in gloom</s>  at other spots the slope isso precipitous that beasts of burden can scarcely keep their footholdindeed we were soon obliged to transfer ourselves from the camels tohorses accustomed to the rocks</s>  at others again it follows the brinkof a yawning precipice an ugly place to ride or turn rectangularcorners which halfadozen men could hold against an army and twice itpasses through tunnels though whether these are natural i do not know</s> besides all these obstacles to an invader there were strong gates atintervals with towers near by where guards were stationed night andday and fosses or dry moats in front of them which could only becrossed by means of drawbridges</s>  so the reader will easily understandhow it came about that whatever the cowardice of the abati though theystrove for generations the fung had as yet never been able to recapturethe ancient stronghold which or so it is said in the beginning theseabati won from them by means of an oriental trick</s> here i should add that although there are two other roads to theplainsthat by which in order to outflank the fung the camels werelet down when i started on my embassy to egypt and that to the northwhere the great swamps liethese are both of them equally if not moreimpassable at any rate to an enemy attacking from below</s> a strange cavalcade we must have seemed as we crawled up this terrificapproach</s>
 next came a company ofhorsemen armed with spears or rather two companies in the centre ofwhich rode the child of kings some of her courtiers and chief officersand ourselves perhaps as quick suggested because infantry in theevent of surprise would find it less easy to run away than those whowere mounted upon horses</s>  last of all rode more cavalry the dutyof whose rear files it was to turn from time to time and afterinspection to shout out that we were not pursued</s> it cannot be said that we who occupied the centre of the advance were acheerful band</s>  orme although so far he had borne up was evidently veryill from the shock of the explosion so much so that men had to be seton each side of him to see that he did not fall from the saddle</s>  alsohe was deeply depressed by the fact that honour had forced us to abandonhiggs to what seemed a certain and probably a cruel death and if hefelt thus what was my own case who left not only my friend but alsomy son in the hands of savage heathens</s> maquedas face was not visible because of the thin spangled veil thatshe wore but there was something about her attitude suggestive of shameand of despair</s>  the droop of the head and even her back showed this asi who rode a little behind and on side of her could see</s>  i think toothat she was anxious about orme for she turned toward him several timesas though studying his condition</s>  also i am sure that she was indignantwith joshua and others of her officers for when they spoke to hershe would not answer or take the slightest notice of them beyondstraightening herself in the saddle</s>  as for the prince himself histemper seemed to be much ruffled although apparently he had overcomethe hurt to his back which prevented him from accepting the sultanschallenge for at a difficult spot in the road he dismounted and ranalong actively enough</s>  at any rate when his subordinates addressed himhe only answered them with muttered oaths and his attitude towards usenglishmen especially quick was not amiable</s>  indeed if looks couldhave killed us i am sure that we should all have been dead before everwe reached the gate of mur</s> this socalled gate was the upper mouth of the pass whence first wesaw lying beneath us the vast mountainringed plain beyond</s>  it wasa beautiful sight in the sunshine</s>  almost at our feet halfhiddenin palms and other trees lay the flatroofed town itself a place ofconsiderable extent as every house of any consequence seemed to beset in a garden since here there was no need for cramping walls anddefensive works</s>  beyond it to the northward farther than the eye couldreach stretching down a gentle slope to the faroff shores of thegreat lake of glistening water were cultivated fields and amongst themvillas and here and there hamlets</s> whatever might be the faults of the abati evidently they were skilledhusbandsmen such as their reputed forefathers the old inhabitants ofjuda must have been before them for of that strain presumably sometrace was still present in their veins</s>  however far he may have driftedfrom such pursuits originally the jew was a tiller of the soil andhere where many of his other characteristics had evaporated underpressure of circumstancesnotably the fierce courage that titusknewthis taste remained to him if only by tradition</s> indeed having no other outlet for their energies and none with whom totrade the interests of the abati were centred in the land</s>  for andby the land they lived and died and since the amount available waslimited by the mountain wall he who had most land was great amongstthem he who had little land was small he who had no land waspractically a slave</s>  their law was in its essentials a law of theland their ambitions their crimes everything to do with them wereconcerned with the land upon the produce of which they existed and grewrich some of them by means of a system of barter</s>  they had no coinagetheir money being measures of corn or other produce horses camelsacres of their equivalent of soil and so forth</s> and yet oddly enough their country is the richest in gold and othermetals that i have ever heard of even in africaso rich that accordingto higgs the old egyptians drew bullion from it to the value ofmillions of pounds every year</s>  this indeed i can well believe for ihave seen the ancient mines which were worked for the most part asopen quarries still showing plenty of visible gold on the face of theslopes</s>  yet to these alleged jews this gold was of no account</s>  imagineit as quick said such a topsyturvy state of things was enough to makea mere christian feel cold down the back and go to bed thinking that theworld must be coming to an end</s> to return the prince joshua who appeared to be generalissimo of thearmy in what was evidently a set phrase exhorted the guards at thelast gates to be brave and if need were deal with the heathen as someone or other dealt with og king of bashan and other unlucky personsof a different faith</s>  in reply he received their earnest congratulationsupon his escape from the frightful dangers of our journey</s> these formalities concluded casting off the iron discipline of warwe descended a joyous mob or rather the abati did to partake of thedelights of peace</s>  really conquerors returning from some desperateadventure could not have been more warmly greeted</s>  as we entered thesuburbs of the town women some of them very handsome ran out andembraced their lords or lovers holding up babies for them to kiss anda little farther on children appeared throwing roses and pomegranateflowers before their triumphant feet</s>  and all this because these gallantmen had ridden to the bottom of a pass and back again</s> heavens</s>  doctor exclaimed the sardonic quick after taking note ofthese demonstrations heavens</s>  what a hero i feel myself to be</s>  andto think that when i got back from the war with them boers after beingleft for dead on spion kop with a bullet through my lung and mentionedin a dispatchyes i sergeant quick mentioned in a dispatch by thebiggest ass of a general as ever i clapped eyes on for a job thati wont detail no one in my native village ever took no note ofme although i had written to the parish clerk who happens to be mybrotherinlaw and told him the train i was coming by</s>  i tell youdoctor no one so much as stood me a pint of beer let alone wine andhe pointed to a lady who was proffering that beverage to some one whomshe admired</s> and as for chucking their arms round my neck and kissing me andhe indicated another episode all my old mother saidshe was alivethenwas that she hoped id done fooling about furrin parts as icalled soldiering and come home to live respectable better late thannever</s>  well doctor circumstances alter cases or blood and climatedo which is the same thing and i didnt miss what i never expectedwhy should i when others like the captain there who had done so muchmore fared worse</s>  but lord</s>  these abati are a sickening lot and iwish we were clear of them</s>  old barungs the boy for me</s> passing down the main street of this charming town of mur accompaniedby these joyous demonstrators we came at last to its central square alarge open space where in the moist and genial climate for the highsurrounding mountains attracted plentiful showers of rain trees andflowers grew luxuriantly</s>  at the head of this square stood a longlow building with whitewashed walls and gilded domes backed by thetowering cliff but at a little distance from it and surrounded bydouble walls with a moat of water between them dug for purposes ofdefence</s> this was the palace which on my previous visit i had only entered onceor twice when i was received by the child of kings in formal audience</s> round the rest of this square each placed in its own garden were thehouses of the great nobles and officials and at its western end amongother public buildings a synagogue or temple which looked like a modelof that built by solomon in jerusalem from the description of which ithad indeed been copied though of course upon a small scale</s> at the gate of the palace we halted and joshua riding up askedmaqueda sulkily whether he should conduct the gentiles for that washis polite description of us to the lodging for pilgrims in the westerntown</s> no my uncle answered maqueda these foreign lords will be housed inthe guestwing of the palace</s> in the guestwing of the palace</s>  it is not usual gobbled

goodnight my uncle when you are recovered we will meetagain for we have much that we must discuss</s>  nay nay you are mostkind but i will not detain you another minute</s>  seek your bed my uncleand forget not to thank god for your escape from many perils</s> at this polite mockery joshua turned perfectly pale with rage like theturkey cock when his wattles fade from scarlet into white</s>  before hecould make any answer however maqueda had vanished under the archwayso his only resource was to curse us and especially quick who hadcaused him to fall from his horse</s>  unfortunately the sergeant understoodquite enough arabic to be aware of the tenor of his remarks which heresented and returnedshut it porpoise he said and keep your eyes where nature put emor theyll fall out</s> what says the gentile</s>  spluttered joshua whereon orme waking up fromone of his fits of lethargy replied in arabiche says that he prays you o prince of princes to close your noblemouth and to keep your highbred eyes within their sockets lest youshould lose them at which words those who were listening broke intoa fit of laughter for one redeeming characteristic among the abati wasthat they had a sense of humour</s> after this i do not quite know what happened for orme showed signs offainting and i had to attend to him</s>  when i looked round again thegates were shut and we were being conducted toward the guestwing of thepalace by a number of gaily dressed attendants</s> they took us to our roomscool lofty chambers ornamented with glazedtiles of quaint colour and beautiful design and furnished somewhatscantily with articles made of richhued woods</s>  this guestwing of thepalace where these rooms were situated formed we noted a separatehouse having its own gateway but so far as we could see no passageor other connection joining it to the main building</s>  in front of it wasa small garden and at its back a courtyard with buildings in which wewere informed our camels had been stabled</s>  at the time we noted no morefor night was falling and even if it had not been we were too wornout to make researches</s> moreover orme was now desperately illso ill that he could scarcelywalk leaning even on our shoulders</s>  still he would not be satisfiedtill he was sure that our stores were safe and before he could bepersuaded to lie down insisted upon being supported to a vault withcopperbound doors which the officers opened revealing the packagesthat had been taken from the camels</s> count them sergeant he said and quick obeyed by the light of a lampthat the officer held at the open door</s>  all correct sir he said sofar as i can make out</s> very good sergeant</s>  lock the door and take the keys</s> again he obeyed and when the officer demurred to their surrenderturned on him so fiercely that the man thought better of it and departedwith a shrug of his shoulders as i supposed to make report to hissuperiors</s> then at length we got orme to bed and as he complained of intolerablepains in his head and would take nothing but some milk and water havingfirst ascertained that he had no serious physical injuries that i coulddiscover i administered to him a strong sleepingdraught from my littletravelling medicine case</s>  to our great relief this took effect upon himin about twenty minutes causing him to sink into a stupor from which hedid not awake for many hours</s> quick and i washed ourselves ate some food that was brought to us andthen took turns to watch orme throughout the night</s>  when i was at mypost about six oclock on the following morning he woke up and asked fordrink which i gave to him</s>  after swallowing it he began to wander inhis mind and on taking his temperature i found that he had over fivedegrees of fever</s>  the end of it was that he went off to sleep againonly waking up from time to time and asking for more drink</s> twice during the night and early morning maqueda sent to inquire as tohis condition and apparently not satisfied with the replies about tenin the forenoon arrived herself accompanied by two waitingladies and alongbearded old gentleman who i understood was the court physician</s> may i see him</s>  she asked anxiously</s> i answered yes if she and those with her were quite quiet</s>  then i ledthem into the darkened room where quick stood like a statue at the headof the bed only acknowledging her presence with a silent salute</s>  shegazed at olivers flushed face and the forehead blackened where thegases from the explosion had struck him and as she gazed i saw herbeautiful violet eyes fill with tears</s>  then abruptly she turned andleft the sickchamber</s>  outside its doors she waved back her attendantsimperiously and asked me in a whisperwill he live</s> i do not know i answered for i thought it best that she should learnthe truth</s>  if he is only suffering from shock fatigue and fever ithink so but if the explosion or the blow on his head where it cut hasfractured the skull thensave him she muttered</s>  i will give you all inay pardon me whatneed is there to tempt you his friend with reward</s>  only save him savehim</s> i will do what i can lady but the issue is in other hands than minei answered and just then her attendants came up and put an end to theconversation</s> to this day the memory of that old rabbi the court physician affectsme like a nightmare for of all the medical fools that ever i met hewas by far the most preeminent</s>  all about the place he followed mesuggesting remedies that would have been absurd even in the middle ages</s> the least harmful of them i remember was that poor ormes head shouldbe plastered with a compound of butter and the bones of a stillbornchild and that he should be given some filthy compound to drink whichhad been specially blessed by the priests</s>  others there were also thatwould certainly have killed him in halfanhour</s> well i got rid of him at last for the time and returned to my vigil</s> it was melancholy work since no skill that i had could tell me whethermy patient would live or die</s>  nowadays the young men might know orsay that they did but it must be remembered that as a doctor i amentirely superannuated</s>  how could it be otherwise seeing that i havepassed the best of my life in the desert without any opportunity ofkeeping up with the times</s> three days went by in this fashion and very anxious days they were</s>  formy part although i said nothing of it to any one i believed that therewas some injury to the patients skull and that he would die or at bestbe paralyzed</s>  quick however had a different opinion</s>  he said that hehad seen two men in this state before from the concussion caused bythe bursting of large shells near to them and that they both recoveredalthough one of them became an idiot</s> but it was maqueda who first gave me any definite hope</s>  on the thirdevening she came and sat by orme for awhile her attendants standingat a little distance</s>  when she left him there was a new look upon herfacea very joyful lookwhich caused me to ask her what had happened</s> oh</s>  he will live she answered</s> i inquired what made her think so</s> this she replied blushing</s>  suddenly he looked up and in my owntongue asked me of what colour were my eyes</s>  i answered that it dependedupon the light in which they might be seen</s> not at all he said</s>  they are always violet whether the curtainis drawn or no</s>  now physician adams tell me what is this colourviolet</s> that of a little wild flower which grows in the west in the spring omaquedaa very beautiful and sweetscented flower which is dark bluelike your eyes</s> indeed physician she said</s>  well i do not know this flower butwhat of that</s>  your friend will live and be sane</s>  a dying man does nottrouble about the colour of a ladys eyes and one who is mad does notgive that colour right</s> are you glad o child of kings</s>  i asked</s> of course she answered seeing that i am told that this captainalone can handle the firestuffs which you have brought with you andtherefore that it is necessary to me that he should not die</s> i understand i replied</s>  let us pray that we may keep him alive</s>  butthere are many kinds of firestuffs o maqueda and of one of themwhich chances to give out violet flames i am not sure that my friend ismaster</s>  yet in this country it may be the most dangerous of all</s> now when she heard these words the child of kings looked me up and downangrily</s>  then suddenly she laughed a little in a kind of silent way thatis peculiar to her and without saying anything beckoned to her ladiesand left the place</s> very variegated thing woman sir remarked quick who was watching</s> i think he meant to say variable</s>  this one for instance comes upthat passage like a tired horseshuffle shuffle shufflefor i couldhear the heels of her slippers on the floor</s>  but now she goes out likea buck seeking its matehead in air and hoof lifted</s>  how do you explainit doctor</s> you had better ask the lady herself quick</s>  did the captain take thatsoup she brought him</s> every drop sir and tried to kiss her hand afterward being stilldazed poor man poor man</s>  i saw him do it knowing no better</s>  hell besorry enough when he comes to himself</s> no doubt sergeant</s>  but meanwhile let us be glad that both theirspirits seem to have improved and if she brings any more soup when iam not there i should let him have it</s>  it is always well to humourinvalids and women</s> yes doctor but he added with a sudden fall of face invalidsrecover sometimes and then how about the women</s> sufficient to the day is the evil thereof i answered you had bettergo out for exercise it is my watch</s>  but to myself i thought that fatewas already throwing its ominous shadow before and that it lay deep inmaquedas violet eyes</s> well to cut a long story short this was the turningpoint of ormesillness and from that day he recovered rapidly for as it provedthere was no secret injury to the skull and he was suffering fromnothing except shock and fever</s>  during his convalescence the child ofkings came to see him several times or to be accurate if my memoryserves me right every afternoon</s>  of course her visits were those ofceremonythat is to say she was always accompanied by several ofher ladies that thorn in my flesh the old doctor and one or twosecretaries and officersinwaiting</s> but as oliver was now moved by day into a huge reception room and thesepeople of the court were expected to stop at one end of it while sheconversed with him at the other to all intents and purposes save forthe presence of myself and quick her calls were of a private nature</s> nor were we always present since now that my patient was out of dangerthe sergeant and i went out riding a good dealinvestigating mur andits surroundings</s> it may be asked what they talked about on these occasions</s>  i can onlyanswer that so far as i heard the general subject was the politicsof mur and its perpetual war with the fung</s>  still there must have beenother topics which i did not hear since incidently i discovered thatorme was acquainted with many of maquedas private affairs whereof hecould only have learned from her lips</s> thus when i ventured to remark that perhaps it was not altogetherwise for a young man in his position to become so intimate with thehereditary ruler of an exclusive tribe like the abati he repliedcheerfully that this did not in the least matter as of courseaccording to their ancient laws she could only marry with one of herown family a fact which made all complications impossible</s>  i inquiredwhich of her cousins of whom i knew she had several was the happy man</s> he repliednone of them</s>  as a matter of fact i believe that she is officiallyaffianced to that fat uncle of hers the fellow who blows his owntrumpet so much but i neednt add that this is only a form to which shesubmits in order to keep the others off</s> ah</s>  i said</s>  i wonder if prince joshua thinks it only a form</s> dont know what he thinks and dont care he replied yawning ionly know that things stand as i say and that the porpoiseman has asmuch chance of becoming the husband of maqueda as you have of marryingthe empress of china</s>  and now to drop this matrimonial conversation andcome to something more important have you heard anything about higgsand your son</s> you are more in the way of learning state secrets than i am orme ianswered sarcastically being rather irritated at the course of eventsand his foolishness</s>  what have you heard</s> this old fellow</s>  i cant say how she knows it but maqueda says thatthey are both in good health and well treated</s>  only our friend barungsticks to his word and proposes to sacrifice poor old higgs on this dayfortnight</s>  now of course that must be prevented somehow and preventedit shall be if it costs me my life</s>  dont you suppose that i have beenthinking about myself all the time for it isnt so only the trouble isthat i cant find any plan of rescue which will hold water</s> then whats to be done orme</s>  i havent spoken much of the matterbefore for fear of upsetting you when you were still weak but now thatyou are all right again we must come to some decision</s> i know i know he answered earnestly and i tell you this thatrather than let higgs die alone there i will give myself up to barungand if i cant save him suffer with him or for him if i can</s>  listenthere is to be a great council held by the child of kings on the dayafter tomorrow which we must attend for it has only been postponeduntil i was well enough</s>  at this council that rogue shadrach is to beput upon his trial and will i believe be condemned to death</s>  also weare formally to return shebas ring which maqueda lent to you to be usedin proof of her story</s>  well we may learn something then or at any ratemust make up our minds to definite action</s>  and now i am to have my firstride am i not</s>  come on pharaoh he added to the dog which had stuckat his bedside all through his illness so closely that it was difficultto entice him away even to eat we are going for a ride pharaoh doyou hear that you faithful beast</s> chapter ixthe swearing of the oathtwo or three days after this conversation i forget exactly which itwas maqueda held her council in the great hall of the palace</s>  when weentered the place in charge of a guard as though we were prisoners wefound some hundreds of abati gathered there who were seated in orderlyrows upon benches</s>  at the farther end in an apseshaped space sat thechild of kings herself on a gilded or perhaps a golden chair of whichthe arms terminated in lions heads</s>  she was dressed in a robe ofglittering silver and wore a ceremonial veil embroidered with starsalso of silver and above it set upon her dark hair a little circletof gold in which shone a single gem that looked like a ruby</s>  thusattired although her stature is small her appearance was verydignified and beautiful especially as the gossamer veil added mysteryto her face</s> behind the throne stood soldiers armed with spears and swords and atits sides and in front of it were gathered her court to the number of ahundred or more including her waitingladies who in two companies werearranged to the right and left</s>  each member of this court was gorgeouslydressed according to his profession</s> there were the generals and captains with prince joshua at the head ofthem in their normanlike chain armour</s>  there were judges in black robesand priests in gorgeous garments there were territorial lords ofwhose attire i remember only that they wore high boots and men who werecalled marketmasters whose business it was to regulate the rate ofexchange of products and with them the representatives of other trades</s> in short here was collected all the aristocracy of the littlepopulation of the town and territory of mur every one of whom as wefound afterwards possessed some highsounding title answering tothose of our dukes and lords and right honourables and knights to saynothing of the princes of the blood of whom joshua was the first</s> really although it looked so fine and gay the spectacle was in asense piteous being evidently but a poor mockery and survival of thepageantry of a people that had once been great</s>  the vast hall in whichthey were assembled showed this since although the occasion was onethat excited public interest it was after all but a quarter filled bythose who had a right to be present</s> with much dignity and to the sound of music we were marched up the broadnave if i may describe it thus for the building with its apse andsupporting cedar columns bore some resemblance to a cathedral tillwe reached the open space in front of the throne where our guardsprostrated themselves in their eastern fashion and we saluted itsoccupant in our own</s>  then chairs having been given to us after a pausea trumpet blew and from a side chamber was produced our late guideshadrach heavily manacled and looking extremely frightened</s> the trial that followed i need not describe at length</s>  it took a longwhile and the three of us were called upon to give evidence as to thequarrel between our companion the professor and the prisoner about thedog pharaoh and other matters</s>  the testimony however that proclaimedthe guilt of shadrach was that of his companion guides who itappeared had been threatened with floggings unless they told the truth</s> these men swore one after the other that the abandonment of higgs hadbeen a preconceived plan</s>  several of them added that shadrach was intraitorous communication with the fung whom he had warned of our adventby firing the reeds and had even contrived to arrange that we were tobe taken while he and the other abati with the camels laden with ourrifles and goods which they hoped to steal passed through in safety</s> in defence shadrach boldly denied the whole story and especially thathe had pushed the gentile higgs off his dromedary as was allegedand mounted it himself because his own beast had broken down or beeninjured</s> however his lies availed him little since after consultation with thechild of kings presently one of the blackrobed judges condemned himto suffer death in a very cruel fashion which was reserved for traitors</s> further his possessions were to be forfeited to the state and his wifeand children and household to become public slaves which meant that themales would be condemned to serve as soldiers and the females allottedto certain officials in the order of their rank</s> several of those who had conspired with him to betray us to the fungwere also deprived of their possessions and condemned to the army whichwas their form of penal servitude</s> thus amidst a mighty wailing of those concerned and of their friendsand relatives ended this remarkable trial of which i give some accountbecause it throws light upon the social conditions of abati</s>  what hopeis there for a people when its criminals are sent not to jail but toserve as soldiers and their womenfolk however innocent are doomedto become the slaves of the judges or whoever these may appoint</s>  be itadded however that in this instance shadrach and his friends deservedall they got since even allowing for a certain amount of falseevidence undoubtedly for the purposes of robbery and private hatethey did betray those whom their ruler had sent them to guide andprotect</s> when this trial was finished and shadrach had been removed howling formercy and attempting to kiss our feet like the cur he was the audiencewho had collected to hear it and to see us the gentile strangersdispersed and the members of the privy council if i may call it sowere summoned by name to attend to their duties</s>  when all had gatheredwe three were requested to advance and take seats which had been placedfor us among the councillors</s> then came a pause and as i had been instructed that i should do iadvanced and laid shebas ring upon a cushion held by one of the courtofficers who carried it to maqueda</s> child of kings i said take back this ancient token which you lentto me to be a proof of your good faith and mine</s>  know that by means ofit i persuaded our brother who is captive a man learned in all thathas to do with the past to undertake this mission and through him thecaptain orme who stands before you and his servant the soldier</s> she took it and after examination showed it to several of the priestsby whom it was identified</s> though i parted from it with fear and doubt the holy ring has servedits purpose well she said and i thank you physician for returningit to my people and to me in safety</s> then she replaced it on the finger from which it had been withdrawn whenshe gave it to me many months before</s> there then that matter ended</s> now an officer criedwalda nagasta speaks</s>  whereon every one repeated walda nagastaspeaks and was silent</s> then maqueda began to address us in her soft and pleasant voice</s> strangers from the western country called england she said bepleased to hear me</s>  you know our case with the fungthat they surroundus and would destroy us</s>  you know that in our extremity i took advantageof the wandering hither of one of you a year ago to beg him to go to hisown land and there obtain firestuffs and those who understand them withwhich to destroy the great and ancient idol of the fung</s>  for that peopledeclare that if this idol is destroyed they will leave the land theydwell in for another such being their ancient prophecy</s> pardon o child of kings interrupted orme but you will rememberthat only the other day barung sultan of the fung said that in thisevent his nation would still live on to avenge their god harmac</s>  alsohe said that of all the abati he would leave you alive alone</s> now at these illomened words a shiver and a murmur went through thecouncil</s>  but maqueda only shrugged her shoulders causing the silvertrimmings on her dress to tinkle</s> i have told you the ancient prophecy she answered and for the restwords are not deeds</s>  if the foul fiend harmac goes i think thatthe fung will follow him</s>  otherwise why do they make sacrifice toearthquake as the evil god they have to fear</s>  and when some fivecenturies ago such an earthquake shook down part of the secret city inthe bowels of the mountains that i will show to you afterwards why didthey fly from mur and take up their abode in the plain as they said toprotect the god</s> i do not know answered oliver</s>  if our brother were here he whomthe fung have captured he might know being learned in the ways ofidolworshipping savage peoples</s> alas</s>  o son of orme she said thanks to that traitor whom but now wehave condemned he is not here and perhaps could tell us nothing ifhe were</s>  at least the saying runs as i have spoken it and for manygenerations because of it we abati have desired to destroy the idol ofthe fung to which so many of us have been offered in sacrifice throughthe jaws of their sacred lions</s>  now i ask and she leaned forwardlooking at oliver will you do this for me</s> speak of the reward my niece broke in joshua in his thick voicewhen he saw that we hesitated what to answer i have heard that thesewestern gentiles are a very greedy people who live and die for the goldwhich we despise</s> ask him captain exclaimed quick if they despise land also sinceyesterday afternoon i saw one of them try to cut the throat of anotherover a piece not bigger than a large dogkennel</s> yes i added for i confess that joshuas remarks nettled me and askhim whether the jews did not despoil the egyptians of their ornamentsof gold in the old days and whether solomon whom he claims as aforefather did not trade in gold to ophir and lastly whether he knowsthat most of his kindred in other lands make a very god of gold</s> so orme as our spokesman put these questions with great gusto tojoshua whom he disliked intensely whereat some of the council thosewho were not of the party of the prince smiled or even laughed and thesilvery ornaments upon maquedas dress began to shake again as thoughshe also were laughing behind her veil</s>  still she did not seem to thinkit wise to allow joshua to answerif he couldbut did so herselfsayingthe truth is o my friends that here we set small store by goldbecause being shut in and unable to trade it is of no use to us saveas an ornament</s>  were it otherwise doubtless we should value it as muchas the rest of the world jew or gentile and shall do so when we arefreed from our foes who hem us in</s>  therefore my uncle is wrong to claimas a virtue that which is only a necessity especially when as yourservant says and she pointed to the sergeant our people make landtheir gold and will spend their lives in gaining more of it even whenthey have enough</s> then do the gentiles seek no reward for their services</s>  sneeredjoshua</s> by no means prince answered oliver we are soldiers of fortunesince otherwise why should we have come here to fight your quarrellaying an unpleasant emphasis on the your against a chief whoif half savage to us seems to have some merits those of honour andcourage for instance</s>  if we risk our lives and do our work we are nottoo proud to take whatever we can earn</s>  why should we be seeing thatsome of us need wealth and that our brother who is as good as deadyonder owing to the treachery of those who were sent to guard himhas relatives in england who are poor and should be compensated for hisloss</s> why indeed</s>  ejaculated maqueda</s>  listen now my friends</s>  in myown name and in that of the abati people i promised to you as manycamelloads of this gold as you can carry away from mur and before theday is done i will show it to you if you dare follow me to where it lieshid</s> first the work then the pay said oliver</s>  now tell us child ofkings what is that work</s> this o son of orme</s>  you must swearif this is not against yourconsciences as christiansthat for the space of one year from todayyou will serve me and fight for me and be subject to my laws strivingall the while to destroy the idol harmac by your western skill andweapons after which you shall be free to go whither you will with yourreward</s> and if we swear lady asked oliver after reflection tell us whatrank shall we hold in your service</s> you shall be my chief captain for this enterprise o son of ormeand those with you shall serve under you in such positions as you mayplease</s> at these words a murmur of dissatisfaction arose from the mailcladgenerals in the council</s> are we then to obey this stranger o child of kings</s>  queried joshuaas their spokesman</s> aye my uncle so far as this great enterprise is concerned as i havesaid</s>  can you handle the firestuffs of which they alone have the secret</s> could any three of you have held the gate of harmac against the armiesof the fung and sent it flying skyward</s> she paused and waited in the midst of a sullen silence</s> you do not answer because you cannot continued maqueda</s>  then forthis purpose be content to serve awhile under the command of those whohave the skill and power which you lack</s> still there was no answer</s> lady said orme in this ominous quiet you are so good as to make mea general among your soldiers but will they obey me</s>  and who are yoursoldiers</s>  does every man of the abati bear arms</s> alas</s>  no she replied fixing upon this latter question perhapsbecause she could not answer the first</s>  alas</s>  no</s>  in the old days itwas otherwise when my great ancestresses ruled and then we did notfear the fung</s>  but now the people will not serve as soldiers</s>  they sayit takes them from their trades and the games they love they say theycannot give the time in youth they say that it degrades a man to obeythe orders of those set over him they say that war is barbarous andshould be abolished and all the while the brave fung wait without tomassacre our men and make our women slaves</s>  only the very poor and thedesperate and those who have offended against the laws will serve in myarmy except it be as officers</s>  oh</s>  and therefore are the abati doomedand throwing back her veil suddenly she burst into tears before usall</s> i do not know that i ever remember seeing a sight more pathetic in itsway than that of this beautiful and highspirited young woman weepingin the presence of her council over the utter degeneracy of the raceshe was called upon to rule</s>  being old and accustomed to these easternexpressions of emotion i remained silent however but oliver was sodeeply affected that i feared lest he should do something foolish</s>  hewent red he went white and was rising from his seat to go to her hadi not caught him by the arm and pulled him back</s>  as for quick he turnedhis eyes to the ceiling as though engaged in prayer and i heard himmutteringthe lord help the poor thing the lord help her the one pearl in thesnout of all these gilded swine</s>  well i understand i am a bit of ageneral now and if i dont make em sit up for her sake my name aintsamuel quick</s> meanwhile there was much consternation and indignant murmuringamongst the court which felt that reflections had been thrown upon itcollectively and individually</s>  at such a crisis as usual prince joshuatook the lead</s>  rising from his seat he knelt not without difficultybefore the throne and saido child of kings why do you distress us with such words</s>  have you notthe god of solomon to protect you</s> god protects those who protect themselves sobbed maqueda</s> and have you not many brave officers</s> what are officers without an army</s> and have you not me your uncle your affianced your lover</s>  and helaid his hand where he conceived his heart to be and stared up at herwith his rolling fishlike eyes</s>  had it not been for the interferenceof these gentiles in whom you seem to put such trust he went onshould i not have taken barung captive the other day and left the fungwithout a head</s> and the abati without such shreds of honour as still belong to them myuncle</s> let us be wed o bud of the rose o flower of mur and soon i will freeyou from the fung</s>  we are helpless because we are separate but togetherwe shall triumph</s>  say o maqueda when shall we be wed</s> when the idol harmac is utterly destroyed and the fung have departedfor ever my uncle she answered impatiently</s>  but is this a time totalk of marriage</s>  i declare the council closed</s>  let the priests bringthe rolls that these strangers from the west may take the oath and thenpardon me if i leave you</s> now from behind the throne there appeared a gorgeous gentleman arrayedin a headdress that reminded me faintly of a bishops mitre andwearing over his robes a breastplate of precious stones roughlypolished which was half hidden by a very long white beard</s> this person who it seemed was the high priest carried in his handa double roll of parchment written over with characters which weafterwards discovered were bastard hebrew very ancient and onlydecipherable by three or four of the abati if indeed any of them couldreally read it</s>  at least it was said to be the roll of the law broughtby their forefathers centuries ago from abyssinia together with shebasring and a few other relics among them the cradle a palpable forgeryin which the child of solomon and maqueda or belchis the first knownqueen of sheba was traditionally reported to have been rocked</s>  thisroll of the law which for generations had been used at all importantceremonies among the abati such as the swearingin of their queens andchief officers was now tendered to us to hold and kiss while we tookthe oath of obedience and allegiance in the names of jehovah and ofsolomon a strange mixture it struck us solemnly vowing to performthose things which i have already set out</s> this seems a pretty wide promise said oliver after it had been readto us and translated by me to quick</s>  do you think that we ought to takeit on</s> i answered yes that was from my point of view since otherwise i sawno chance of achieving the object that had caused me to enter upon thisadventure</s>  then being especially requested to do so the sergeantafter reflecting awhile gave his considered opinion</s> sir he said to orme we are three white men here consorting with amob of quarterbred african jews and one real lady</s>  it seems to me thatwe had best swear anything they want us to trusting to the lady to seeus through the mess since otherwise we shall be mere filibusters in thecountry without official rank and liable therefore to be shot on sightby the enemy or any mutineers who get the upper hand here</s>  also wehave the professor and the doctors son to think of</s>  therefore i sayswear to anything in reason reserving allegiance to the crown of greatbritain and trust to luck</s>  you see captain we are in their poweranyway and this oath may help but cant hurt us while to refuse itmust give offence to all these skunks and perhaps to the lady alsowhich is of more consequence</s> i think you are probably right sergeant said orme</s>  anyway in for apenny in for a pound</s> then he turned to maqueda who had been watching this conference in anunknown tongue with some anxiety or so it seemed to me and added inarabic o child of kings we will take your oath although it is widetrusting to your honour to protect us from any pitfalls which it maycover for we would ask you to remember that we are strangers in yourland who do not understand its laws and customs</s>  only we stipulatethat we retain our allegiance to our own ruler far away remaining thesubjects of that monarch with all rights thereto appertaining</s>  alsowe stipulate that before we enter on our duties or at any rate duringthose duties we shall be at full liberty to attempt the rescue of ourfriend and companion now a prisoner in the hands of the fung and ofthe son of one of us who is believed to be a slave to them and thatwe shall have all the assistance which you can give us in this matter</s> moreover we demand that if we should be tried for any offence underthis oath you to whom we swear allegiance shall be our judge alonenone others intermeddling in the trial</s>  if you accept these termswe will swear the oath otherwise we swear nothing but will act asoccasion may arise</s> now we were requested to stand back while the child of kings consultedwith her advisers which she did for a considerable time sinceevidently the questions raised involved differences of opinion</s>  in theend however she and those who supported her seemed to overrule theobjectors and we were called up and told that our terms had beenaccepted and engrossed upon the form of the oath and that everythingthere included would be faithfully observed by the ruler and council ofthe abati</s> so we signed and swore kissing the book or rather the roll in thecivilized fashion</s>  afterwards very tired for all this business hadbeen anxious we were conducted back to our own quarters to lunch orrather to dine for the abati ate their heaviest meal at midday takinga siesta after it according to the common eastern custom</s> about four oclock of that afternoon i was awakened from my nap by thegrowls of pharaoh and looked up to see a man crouching against thedoor evidently in fear of the dogs fangs</s>  he proved to be a messengerfrom maqueda sent to ask us if we cared to accompany her to a placethat we had never seen</s>  of course we answered yes and were at onceled by the messenger to a disused and dusty hall at the back of thepalace where presently maqueda and three of her ladies joined us andwith them a number of men who carried lighted lamps gourds of oil andbundles of torches</s> doubtless friends said maqueda who was unveiled and appeared tohave quite recovered from our outburst of the morning you have seenmany wonderful places in this africa and other lands but now i am aboutto show you one that i think is stranger than them all</s> following her we came to a door at the end of the hall which the menunbolted and shut again behind us and thence passed into a long passagecut in the rock that sloped continuously downwards and at length ledthrough another doorway to the vastest cave that we had ever heard of orseen</s>  so vast was it indeed that the feeble light of our lamps did notsuffice to reach the roof and only dimly showed to right and left theoutlines of what appeared to be shattered buildings of rock</s> behold the cave city of mur said maqueda waving the lamp sheheld</s>  here it was that the ancients whom we believe to have been theforefathers of the fung had their secret stronghold</s>  these walls werethose of their granaries temples and places of ceremonial but as ihave told you centuries ago an earthquake shattered them leaving themas they are now</s>  also it broke down much of the cave itself causingthe roof to fall so that there are many parts where it is not safe toenter</s>  come now and see what is left</s> we followed her into the depth of the wonderful place our lanterns andtorches making little stars of light in that great blackness</s>  we saw theruins of granaries still filled with the dust of what i suppose had oncebeen corn and came at length to a huge roofless building of whichthe area was strewn with shattered columns and among them overgrownstatues covered so thick by dust that we could only discover that mostof them seemed to be shaped like sphinxes</s> if only higgs were here said oliver with a sigh and passed on tomaqueda who was calling him to look at something else</s> leaving the temple in which it was unsafe to walk she led us to wherea strong spring the water supply of the place bubbled up into a rockbasin and overflowing thence through prepared openings ran away weknew not whither</s> look this fountain is very ancient said maqueda pointing to thelip of the basin that was worn away to the depth of several inches wherethose who drew water had for many generations rested their hands uponthe hard rock</s> how did they light so vast a cavern</s>  asked oliver</s> we do not know she answered since lamps would scarcely have servedthem</s>  it is a secret of the past which none of the abati have cared torecover and another is how the air is always kept fresh so deep inthe bowels of the mountain</s>  we cannot even say whether this place isnatural as i think or hollowed out by men</s> both i expect i answered</s>  but tell me lady do the abati make anyuse of this great cave</s> some corn is still stored here in pits in case of siege she repliedadding sadly but it is not enough to be of real service since almostall of it comes from the estates of the child of kings</s>  in vain havei prayed the people to contribute if only a hundredth part of theirharvest but they will not</s>  each says that he would give if hisneighbour gave and so none give</s>  and yet a day may come when a storeof corn alone would stand between them and death by hungerif the fungheld the valley for instance and she turned impatiently and walkedforward to show us the stables where the ancients kept their horses andthe marks of their chariot wheels in the stone floor</s> nice people the abati sir said quick to me</s>  if it werent forthe women and children and above all for this little lady whom i ambeginning to worship like my master as in duty bound id like to seethem do a bit of hungering</s> there is one more place to show you said maqueda when we hadinspected the stables and argued as to what possible causes could haveinduced the ancients to keep horses underground which perhaps you willthink worth a visit since it holds the treasures that are or shall beyours</s>  come</s> we started forward again along various passages the last of whichsuddenly widened into a broad and steep incline of rock which wefollowed for quite fifty paces till it ended in what seemed to be ablank wall</s>  here maqueda bade her ladies and attendants halt whichindeed they seemed very anxious to do though at the moment we did notknow why</s>  then she went to one end of the wall where it joined that ofthe passage and showing us some loose stones asked me to pull themout which i did not without difficulty</s>  when an aperture had been madelarge enough for a man to creep through she turned to her people andsaidyou i know believe this place to be haunted nor would the bravest ofyou enter it save by express command</s>  but i and these strangers have nosuch fears</s>  therefore give us a gourd of oil and some torches and bidewhere you are till we return setting a lamp in the hole in the wall toguide us in case our own should become extinguished</s>  no do not reasonbut obey</s>  there is no danger for though hot the air within is pure asi know who have breathed it more than once</s> then she gave her hand to oliver and with his assistance crept throughthe hole</s>  we followed to find ourselves in another cavern where asshe had said the temperature was much hotter than that without</s> what is this place</s>
the tomb of the old kings of mur she replied</s>  presently you shallsee and once more she took his hand for the slope was sharp andslippery</s> on we went always descending for perhaps four hundred yards ourfootfalls echoing loudly in the intense silence and our lamps roundwhich the bats circled in hundreds making four stars of light inthe utter blackness till at length the passage widened out into whatappeared to be a vast circular arena with a lofty domelike roof ofrock</s>  maqueda turned to the right and halting before some objects thatglimmered whitely held up her light saying look</s> this was what we saw a great stone chair and piled upon its seatand upon its base human bones</s>  amongst these was a skull and on itgrotesquely tilted a crown of gold while other ornamentssceptresrings necklaces weapons and armourwere mingled with the bones</s>  norwas this all for in a wide circle round the chair were other skeletonsfifty or more of them and amongst them the ornaments that their ownershad worn</s> also in front of each stood a tray of some metal which we afterwardsdiscovered to be silver or copper and heaped upon it every kind ofvaluable such as golden cups and vases toilet utensils necklacespectorals bracelets leglets earrings and beads that seemed to be cutfrom precious stones piles of ring money and a hundred other thingssuch as have been prized by mankind since the beginning of civilization</s> you understand said maqueda as we stared openmouthed at this awfuland marvellous sight he in the chair was the king</s>  those about himwere his officers guards and women</s>  when he was buried they broughthis household here bearing his wealth sat them down about him andkilled them</s>  blow away the dust and you will see that the rock beneathis still stained with their blood also there are the swordmarks ontheir skulls and neckbones</s> quick who was of an inquiring mind stepped forward and verified thesestatements</s> golly</s>  he said throwing down the skull of a man over whom the tiredexecutioners had evidently bungled badly im glad i didnt serve theold kings of mur</s>  but the same game goes on in a small way today inafrica for when i was campaigning on the west coast i came acrossit not a fortnight old only there they had buried the poor beggarsliving</s> perhaps said maqueda when the sergeants remarks had been translatedto her</s>  yet i do not think the custom is one that my people wouldlove and she laughed a little then added forward friends thereare many more of these kings and oil does not burn for ever</s> so we moved on and at a distance of some twenty paces found anotherchair with scattered bones on and about the seat lying where eachhad fallen as the dead man decayed</s>  round it were the skeletons of theunfortunates who had been doomed to accompany him upon his last journeyevery one of them behind his tray of golden objects or of simpletreasure</s>  in front of this kings chair also were the bones of a dogwith a jewelled collar</s> again we proceeded to a third mortuary if it may so be called and heremaqueda pointed out the skeleton of a man in front of which stood atray piled up with what evidently had been the medicine bottles of theperiod and among them a number of rude surgical instruments</s> say o physician adams she remarked with a smile would you havewished to be court doctor to the kings of mur if indeed that was thentheir citys name</s> no lady i answered but i do wish to examine his instruments ifi have your leave and while she hurried forward i stooped down andfilled my pockets</s>  here i may remark that upon subsequent inspectioni found among these instruments manufactured i know not what number ofthousands of years agofor on that point controversy rages among thelearnedmany that with modifications are still in use today</s> of that strange and dreadful sepulchre there is little more to tell</s> from monarch to monarch we marched on till at length we grew weary ofstaring at bones and gold</s>  even quick grew weary who had passed hisearly youth in assisting his father the parish sexton and thereforelike myself regarded these relics with professional interest though ofa different degree</s>  at any rate he remarked that this family vault wasuncommonly hot and perhaps if it pleased her majesty as he calledmaqueda we might take the rest of the deceased gentlemen as read likea recruits attestation questions</s> but just then we came to no</s>  25 according to my counting and wereobliged to stop to wonder for clearly this king had been the greatestof them all since round him lay about two or three times the averagenumber of dead and an enormous quantity of wealth some of it in theform of little statues of men and women or perhaps of gods</s>  yet oddlyenough he was hunchback with a huge skull almost a monstrosity indeed</s> perhaps his mind partook of the abnormal qualities of his body since noless than eleven little children had been sacrificed at his obsequiestwo of whom judging from their crooked bones must have been his own</s> one wonders what chanced in mur and the surrounding territories whichthen acknowledged its sway when king hunchback ruled</s>  alas</s>  historywrites no record</s> chapter xquick lights a matchhere we begin to turn for this cave is a great circle said maquedaover her shoulder</s> but oliver whom she addressed had left her side and was engagedin taking observations behind the hunchbacks funeral chair with aninstrument which he had produced from his pocket</s> she followed him and asked curiously what this thing might be and whyhe made use of it here</s> we call it a compass he answered and it tells me that beyond uslies the east where the sun rises also it shows at what height westand above the sea that great water which you have never seen o childof kings</s>  say now if we could walk through this rock what should wefind out yonder</s> the lionheaded idol of the fung i have been told she answered</s> that which you saw before you blew up the gate of the city harmac</s>  buthow far off it may be i do not know for i cannot see through stone</s> friend adams help me to refill the lamps for they burn low and allthese dead would be ill company in the dark</s>  so at least my peoplethink since there is not one of them that dares to enter this place</s> when first we found it only a few years ago and saw the company it heldthey fled and left me to search it alone</s>  look yonder are my footstepsin the dust</s> so i refilled the shallow handlamps and while i did so orme tooksome hasty observations of which he jotted down the results in hispocketbook</s> what have you learned</s>  she asked when at last he rejoined us somewhatunwillingly for she had been calling to him to come</s> not so much as i should have done if you could have given me moretime he replied adding in explanation lady i was brought up asan engineer that is one who executes works and to do so takesmeasurements and makes calculations</s>  for instance those dead men whohollowed or dressed these caves must have been engineers and no meanones</s> we have such among us now she said</s>  they raise dams and make drainsand houses though not so good as those which were built of old</s>  butagain i askwhat have you learned o wise engineer</s> only that here we stand not so very far above the city harmac of whichi chanced to take the level and that behind yonder chair there wasi think once a passage which has been built up</s>  but be pleased to saynothing of the matter lady and to ask me no more questions at presentas i cannot answer them with certainty</s> i see that you are discreet as well as wise she replied with somesarcasm</s>  well since i may not be trusted with your counsel keep it toyourself</s> oliver bowed and obeyed this curt instruction</s> then we began our return journey passing many more groups of skeletonswhich now we scarcely troubled to look at perhaps because the heavy airfilled with dust that once had been the flesh of men was telling onour energies</s>  only i noticed or rather the observant quick called myattention to the fact that as we went the kings in their chairswere surrounded by fewer and fewer attendants and women and that theofferings placed at their feet were of an everlessening value</s>  indeedafter we had passed another five or six of them their murdered retinuesdwindled to a few female skeletons doubtless those of favourite wiveswho had been singled out for this particular honour</s> at length there were none at all the poor monarchs who now werecrowded close together being left to explore the shades alone adornedmerely with their own jewellery and regalia</s>  ultimately even these werereplaced by funeral goldfoil ornaments and the trays of treasure byearthenware jars which appeared to have contained nothing but food andwine and added to these a few spears and other weapons</s>  the last ofthe occupied chairs for there were empty ones beyond contained boneswhich from their slenderness and the small size of the bracelets amongthem i saw at once had belonged to a woman who had been sent to thegrave without companions or any offerings at all</s> doubtless said maqueda when i pointed this out to her at that timethe ancients had grown weak and poor since after so many kings theypermitted a woman to rule over them and had no wealth to waste upon herburial</s>  that may have been after the earthquake when only a few peoplewere left in mur before the abati took possession of it</s> where then are those of your own house buried</s>  asked oliver staringat the empty chairs</s> oh</s>
 we rest in tombs outside and for mypart i will sleep in the simple earth so that i may live on in grassand flowers if in no other way</s>  but enough of death and doom</s>  soonwho can tell how soon</s>  we shall be as these are and she shuddered</s> meanwhile we breathe so let us make the best of breath</s>  you have seenyour fee say does it content you</s> what fee</s>  he asked</s>  death the reward of life</s>  how can i tell until ihave passed its gate</s> here this philosophical discussion was interrupted by the sudden deceaseof quicks lamp</s> thought there was something wrong with the blooming thing said thesergeant but couldnt turn it up as it hasnt got a screw withoutwhich these oldfashioned colza oils never were no good</s>  hullo</s>  doctorthere goes yours and as he spoke go it did</s> the wicks</s>  exclaimed maqueda we forgot to bring new wicks andwithout them of what use is oil</s>  come be swift we are still far fromthe mouth of this cave where none except the high priests will dare toseek us and taking oliver by the hand she began to run leaving ustwo to follow as best we could</s> steady doctor said quick steady</s>  in the presence of disastercomrades should always stick together as it says in the redbookpresented by the crown to warrant officers but paid for out of theirdeferred allowance</s>  take my arm doctor</s>  ah</s>  i thought so the morehaste the less speed</s>  look there and he pointed to the flying shapesahead now a long way off and with only one lamp between them</s> next instant maqueda turned round holding up this remaining lamp andcalled to us</s>  i saw the faint light gleam upon her beautiful face andglitter down the silver ornaments of her dress</s>  very wild and strangeshe looked in that huge vault seen thus for a single moment then seenno more for presently where the flame had been was but a red spark andthen nothing at all</s> stop still till we come back to you cried oliver and shout atintervals</s> yes sir said quick and instantly let off a fearful yellwhich echoed backward and forward across the vault till i was quitebewildered</s> all right coming answered oliver and his voice sounded so far tothe left that quick thought it wise to yell again</s> to cut a long story short we next heard him on our right and thenbehind us</s> cant trust sounds here sir echoes are too uncertain said thesergeant but come on i think ive placed them now and callingto them not to move we headed in what we were sure was the rightdirection</s> the end of that adventure was that presently i tripped up over askeleton and found myself lying half stunned amidst trays of treasureaffectionately clasping a skull under the impression that it was quicksboot</s> he hauled me up again somehow and as we did not know what to do wesat down amidst the dead and listened</s>  by now the others were apparentlyso far off that the sound of olivers calling only reached us in faintmysterious notes that came from we knew not whence</s> as like idiots we started in such a hurry that we forgot to bring anymatches with us there is nothing to be done except wait i said</s>  nodoubt in due course those abati will get over their fear of ghosts andcome to look for us</s> wish i could do the same sir</s>  i didnt mind those deaders in thelight but the darks a different matter</s>  cant you hear them rattlingtheir shanks and talking all round us</s> certainly i do hear something i answered but i think it must be theecho of our own voices</s> well let us hold our jaw sir and perhaps they will hold theirs forthis kind of conversation aint nice</s> so we were silent but the strange murmuring still went on comingapparently from the wall of the cave behind us and it occurred to methat i had once heard something like it before though at the time icould not think where</s>  afterwards i remembered that it was when asa boy i had been taken to see the whispering gallery in st</s>  paulscathedral in london</s> halfanhour or so went by in this fashion and still there were nosigns of the abati or of our missing pair</s>  quick began to fumble amonghis clothes</s>  i asked him what he was doing</s> cant help thinking ive got a wax match somewhere doctor</s>  i rememberfeeling it in one of the pockets of this coat on the day before we leftlondon and thinking afterwards it wasnt safe to have had it packed ina box marked hold</s>  now if only i could find that match we have gotplenty of torches for ive stuck to my bundle all through although inever thought of them when the lamps were going out</s> having small belief in the sergeants match i made no answer and thesearch went on till presently i heard him ejaculateby jingo here it is in the lining</s>  yes and the head feels all right</s> now doctor hold two of the torches toward me make ready presentfire</s>  and he struck the match and applied it to the heads of theresinous torches</s> instantly these blazed up giving an intense light in that awfuldarkness</s>  by this light for one moment only we saw a strange and notunattractive spectacle</s>  i think i forgot to say that in the centre ofthis vault stood a kind of altar which until that moment indeed ihad not seen</s>  this altar which doubtless had been used for ceremonialpurposes at the funerals of the ancient kings consisted of a plainblock of basalt stone whereon was cut the symbol of a human eye thestone being approached by steps and supported upon carved and crouchingsphinxes</s> on the lowest of these steps near enough to enable us to see them quiteclearly were seated oliver orme and maqueda child of kings</s>  they wereseated very close together indeed if i must tell the truth oliversarm was about maquedas waist her head rested upon his shoulder andapparently he was engaged in kissing her upon the lips</s> right about face hissed the sergeant in a tone of command and marktime</s> so we rightabouted for a decent period then coughing loudlybecauseof the irritant smoke of the torchesadvanced to cross the cavernand by accident stumbled upon our lost companions</s>  i confess that i hadnothing to say but quick rose to the occasion nobly</s> glad to see you captain he said to oliver</s>  was getting very anxiousabout you sir until by good luck i found a match in the lining of mycoat</s>  if the professor had been here hed have had plenty which is anargument in favour of continuous smoking even when ladies are present</s> ah</s>  no wonder her majesty is faint in this hot place poor young thing</s> its lucky you didnt leave hold of her sir</s>  do you think you couldmanage to support her sir as we ought to be moving</s>  cant offer to doso myself as i have lamed my foot with the tooth of a dead king alsomy arms are full of torches</s>  but if you prefer the doctorwhat do yousay sir</s>  that you can manage</s>  there is such an echo in this vaultthat it is difficult to hearvery well let us go on for these torcheswont last for ever and you wouldnt like us to have to spend a wholenight here with the lady in such a delicate condition would youespecially as those nastytempered abati might say that you had doneit on purpose</s>  take her majestys arm doctor and let us trek</s>  ill goahead with the torches</s> to all this artless harangue oliver answered not a single word butglared at us suspiciously over the shape of maqueda who apparently hadfainted</s>  only when i ventured to offer her some professional assistanceshe recovered and said that she could get on quite well alone whichmeant upon ormes arm</s> well the end of it was that she got on and so did we for the torcheslasted until we reached the narrow sloping passage and rounding thecorner saw the lantern burning in the hole in the wall after which ofcourse things were easy</s> doctor said oliver to me in a voice of studied nonchalance thatnight as we were preparing to turn in did you notice anything in thevault of kings this afternoon</s> oh yes i answered lots</s>  of course myself i am not given toarchology like poor higgs but the sight struck me as absolutelyunique</s>  if i were inclined to moralize for instance what a contrastbetween those dead rulers and their young and beautiful successor fullof life and lovehere he looked at me sharplylove of her peoplesuch as i have no doubt in their dayoh shut it adams</s>  i dont want a philosophical lecture withhistorical comparisons</s>  did you notice anything except bones and goldwhen that unutterable ass quick suddenly turned on the lightsi meanstruck the match which unfortunately he had with him</s> now i gave it up and faced the situation</s> well if you want the truth i said not very much myself formy sight isnt as good as it used to be</s>  but the sergeant who hasextraordinarily sharp eyes thought that he saw you kissing maquedaa supposition that your relative attitudes seemed to confirm whichexplains moreover some of the curious sounds we heard before he litthe torches</s>  thats why he asked me to turn my back</s>  but of course wemay have been mistaken</s>  do i understand you to say that the sergeant wasmistaken</s> oliver consigned the sergeants eyes to an ultimate fate worse thanthat which befell those of peeping tom then in a burst of candour forsubterfuge never was his forte owned upyou made no mistake he said we love each other and it came outsuddenly in the dark</s>  i suppose that the unusual surroundings acted onour nerves</s> from a moral point of view i am glad that you love each other iremarked since embraces that are merely nervous cannot be commended</s> but from every other in our circumstances the resulting situationstrikes me as a little short of awful although quick a most observantman warned me to expect it from the first</s> curse quick said oliver again with the utmost energy</s>  ill give hima months notice this very night</s> dont i said for then youll oblige him to take service withbarung where he would be most dangerous</s>  look here orme to dropchaff this is a pretty mess</s> why</s>  whats wrong about it doctor</s>  he asked indignantly</s>  of courseshes a jew of some diluted sort or other and im a christian butthose things adapt themselves</s>  of course too shes my superior butafter all hers is a strictly local rank and in europe we should beon much the same footing</s>  as for her being an eastern what does thatmatter</s>  surely it is not an objection which should have weight withyou</s>  and for the rest did you ever see her equal</s> never never never</s>  i answered with enthusiasm</s>  the young ladyto whom any gentleman has just engaged himself is always absolutelyunequalled and let me admit at once that this is perhaps the mostoriginal and charming that i have ever met in all central africa</s>  onlywhatever may be the case with you i dont know whether this fact willconsole me and quick when our throats are being cut</s>  look here orme iadded didnt i tell you long ago that the one thing you must not dowas to make love to the child of kings</s> did you</s>  really i forget you told me such a lot of things doctorhe answered coolly enough only unfortunately the colour that rose inhis cheeks betrayed his lips</s> at this moment quick who had entered the room unobserved gave a drycough and remarkeddont blame the captain doctor because he dont remember</s>  theresnothing like shock from an explosion for upsetting the memory</s>  iveseen that often in the boer war when after a big shell had gone offsomewhere near them the very bravest soldiers would clean forget thatit was their duty to stand still and not run like rabbits indeed ithappened to me myself</s> i laughed and oliver said something which i could not hear but quickwent on imperturbablystill truth is truth and if the captain has forgotten the morereason that we should remind him</s>  that evening at the professors housein london you did warn him sir and he answered that you neednt botheryour head about the fascinations of a nigger womannigger woman broke out oliver i never used such words i nevereven thought them and you are an impertinent fellow to put them into mymouth</s>  nigger woman</s>  good heavens</s>  its desecration</s> very sorry captain now i come to think of it i believe you saidblack woman speaking in your haste</s>  yes and i begged you not to bragseeing that if you did we might live to see you crawling after her withmyself samuel quick bringing up the rear</s>  well there it is we are andthe worst of it is that i cant blame you being as anticipated in theprophecyfor thats what it was though i didnt know it myself atthe timeexactly in the same state myself though of course at adistance bringing up the rear respectfully as said</s>
you dont mean that you are in love with the child of kings</s>  saidoliver staring at the sergeants grim and battered figure</s> begging your pardon captain that is exactly what i do mean</s>
 if a catmay look at a queen why maynt a man love her</s>  howsoever my kind oflove aint likely to interfere with yours</s>  my kind means sentrygo andperhaps a knife in my gizzard yourswell we saw what yours meansthis afternoon though what it will all lead to we didnt see</s>  stillcaptain speaking as one who hasnt been keen on the sex heretoforei saysail in since its worth it even if youve got to sinkafterwards for this lady although she is half a jew and i nevercould abide jews is the sweetest and the loveliest and the best and thebravest little woman that ever walked gods earth</s> at this point oliver seized his hand and shook it warmly and i maymention that i think some report of quicks summary of her charactermust have reached maquedas ears</s>  at any rate thenceforward until theend she always treated the old fellow with what the french call themost distinguished consideration</s> but as i was not in love no one shook my hand so leaving the othertwo to discuss the virtues and graces of the child of kings i went offto bed filled with the gloomiest forbodings</s>  what a fool i had been notto insist that whatever expert accompanied higgs should be a marriedman</s>  and yet now when i came to think of it that might not havebettered matters and perhaps would only have added to the transactiona degree of moral turpitude which at present was lacking since evenmarried men are sometimes weak</s> the truth was that maquedas attractions were extraordinarily great</s>  toher remarkable beauty she added a wonderful charm of manner and forceof mind</s>  also her situation must touch the heart and pity of any manso helpless was she in the midst of all her hollow grandeur so lonelyamongst a nation of curs whom she strove in vain to save and shouldshe escape destruction with them doomed to so sad and repulsive a fatenamely to become the wife of a fat poltroon who was her own uncle</s>  wellwe know to what emotion pity is akin and the catastrophe had occurred alittle sooner than i had expected that was all</s> doubtless to her in comparison with the men to whom she was accustomedand allowed by etiquette to take as her associates this brave andhandsome young englishman who had come into her care sick and shatteredafter the doing of a great deed must have seemed a veritable fairyprince</s>  and she had helped to nurse him and he had shown himselfgrateful for her kindness and condescension andthe rest followed assurely as the day follows the night</s> but how would it end</s>  sooner or later the secret must come out foralready the abati nobles if i may call them so for want of a bettername and especially joshua were bitterly jealous of the favour theirlady showed to the foreigner and watched them both</s>  then whatwhatwould happen</s>  under the abati law it was death for any one outside ofthe permitted degree of relationship to tamper with the affections ofthe child of kings</s>  nor was this wonderful since that person held herseat in virtue of her supposed direct descent from solomon and the firstmaqueda queen of sheba and therefore the introduction of any alienblood could not be tolerated</s> moreover orme having sworn an oath of allegiance had become subjectto those laws</s>  lastly i could not in the least hope from the characterof the pair concerned that this was but a passing flirtation</s> oh</s>  without a doubt these two had signed their own deathwarrant yonderin the cave of death and incidentally ours also</s>  this must be the endof our adventure and my long search for the son whom i had lost</s> chapter xithe rescue failsour breakfast on the following morning was a somewhat gloomy meal</s>  bycommon consent no allusion was made to the events of the previous dayor to our conversation at bedtime</s> indeed there was no talk at all to speak of since not knowingwhat else to do i thought i could best show my attitude of mind bypreserving a severe silence while quick seemed to be absorbedin philosophical reflections and orme looked rather excited anddishevelled as though he had been writing poetry as i daresay wasthe case</s>  in the midst of this dreary meal a messenger arrived whoannounced that the walda nagasta would be pleased to see us all withinhalfanhour</s> fearing lest orme should say something foolish i answered briefly thatwe would wait upon her and the man went leaving us wondering what hadhappened to cause her to desire our presence</s> at the appointed time we were shown into the small audience room andas we passed its door i ventured to whisper to oliverfor your own sake and hers as well as that of the rest of us iimplore you to be careful</s>  your face is watched as well as your words</s> all right old fellow he answered colouring a little</s>  you may trustme</s> i wish i could i muttered</s> then we were shown in ceremoniously and made our bows to maqueda whowas seated surrounded by some of the judges and officers among themprince joshua and talking to two roughlooking men clad in ordinarybrown robes</s>  she greeted us and after the exchange of the usualcompliments saidfriends i have summoned you for this reason</s>  this morning when thetraitor shadrach was being led out to execution at the hands of thesemen the officers of the law he begged for a delay</s>  when asked why ashis petition for reprieve had been refused he said that if his lifewas spared he could show how your companion he whom they call blackwindows may be rescued from the fung</s> how</s>  asked orme and i in one breath</s> i do not know she answered but wisely they spared the man</s>  let himbe brought in</s> a door opened and shadrach entered his hands bound behind his back andshackles on his feet</s>  he was a very fearful and much chastened shadrachfor his eyes rolled and his teeth chattered with terror as havingprostrated himself to the walda nagasta he wriggled round and tried tokiss ormes boot</s>  the guards pulled him to his feet again and maquedasaidwhat have you to tell us traitor before you die</s> the thing is secret o bud of the rose</s>  must i speak before so many</s> nay she answered and ordered most of those present to leave theroom including the executioners and soldiers</s> the man is desperate and there will be none left to guard him saidjoshua nervously</s> ill do that your highness answered quick in his bad arabic andstepping up behind shadrach he added in english now then pussy youbehave or it will be the worse for you</s> when all had gone again shadrach was commanded to speak and say how hecould save the englishman whom he had betrayed into the hands of thefung</s> thus child of kings he answered black windows as we know isimprisoned in the body of the great idol</s> how do you know it man</s> o lady i do know it and also the sultan said so did he not</s>  welli can show a secret road to that idol whence he may be reached andrescued</s>  in my boyhood i who am called cat because i can climb sowell found that road and when the fung took me afterward and threwme to the lions where i got these scars upon my face by it i escaped</s> spare me and i will show it to you</s> it is not enough to show the road said maqueda</s>  dog you must savethe foreign lord whom you betrayed</s>  if you do not save him you die</s>  doyou understand</s> that is a hard saying lady answered the man</s>  am i god that i shouldpromise to save this stranger who perchance is already dead</s>  yet iwill do my best knowing that if i fail you will kill me and that ifi succeed i shall be spared</s>  at any rate i will show you the road towhere he is or was imprisoned although i warn you that it is a roughone</s> where you can travel we can follow said maqueda</s>  tell us now what wemust do</s> so he told her and when he had done the prince joshua intervenedsaying that it was not fitting that the child of kings in her own sacredperson should undertake such a dangerous journey</s>  she listened to hisremonstrances and thanked him for his care of her</s> still i am going she said not for the sake of the stranger who iscalled black windows but because if there is a secret way out of muri think it well that i should know that way</s>  yet i agree with youmy uncle that on such a journey i ought not to be unprotected andtherefore i pray that you will be ready to start with us at noon sincei am sure that then we shall all be safe</s> now joshua began to make excuses but she would not listen to them</s> no no she said you are too honest</s>  the honour of the abati isinvolved in this manner since alas</s>  it was an abati that betrayedblack windows and an abatinamely yourselfmust save him</s>  you haveoften told me my uncle how clever you are at climbing rocks and nowyou shall make proof of your skill and courage before these foreigners</s> it is a command speak no more and she rose to show that the audiencewas finished</s> that same afternoon shadrach by mountain paths that were known to himled a little company of people to the crest of the western precipice ofmur</s>  fifteen hundred feet or more beneath us lay the great plains uponwhich some miles away could be seen the city of harmac</s>  but the idolin the valley we could not see because here the precipice bent over andhid it from our sight</s> what now fellow said maqueda who was clad in the rough sheepskinof a peasant woman which somehow looked charming upon her</s>  here is thecliff there lies the plain i see no road between the two and my wiseuncle the prince tells me that he never heard of one</s> lady answered the man now i take command and you must follow me</s> but first let us see that nobody and nothing are lacking</s> then he went round the company and numbered them</s>  in all we weresixteen maqueda and joshua we three englishmen armed with repeatingrifles and revolvers our guide shadrach and some picked mountaineerschosen for their skill and courage</s>  for even in mur there were brave menleft especially among the shepherds and huntsmen whose homes were onthe cliffs</s>  these sturdy guides were laden with ropes lamps and longslender ladders that could be strapped together</s> when everything had been checked and all the ladders and straps testedshadrach went to a clump of bushes which grew feebly on the windsweptcrest of the precipice</s>  in the midst of these he found and removed alarge flat stone revealing what evidently had been the head of a stairalthough now its steps were much worn and crumbled by the water that inthe wet season followed this natural drain to the depths below</s> this is that road the ancients made for purposes of their ownexplained shadrach which as i have said i chanced to discover wheni was a boy</s>  but let none follow it who are afraid for it is steep andrough</s> now joshua who was already weary with his long ride and walk up to thecrest of the precipice implored maqueda almost passionately to abandonthe idea of entering this horrid hole while oliver backed up hisentreaties with few words but many appealing glances for on this pointthough for different reasons the prince and he were at one</s> but she would not listen</s> my uncle she said with you the experienced mountaineer why shouldi be afraid</s>  if the doctor here who is old enough to be the father ofeither of us so far as joshua was concerned this remark lacked truthis willing to go surely i can go also</s>  moreover if i remained behindyou would wish to stay to guard me and never should i forgive myselfif i deprived you of such a great adventure</s>  also like you i loveclimbing</s>  come let us waste no more time</s> so we were roped up</s>  first went shadrach with quick next to him aposition which the sergeant insisted upon occupying as his custodianand several of the mountaineers carrying ladders lamps oil food andother things</s>  then in a second gang came two more of these men olivermaqueda myself and next to me joshua</s>  the remaining mountaineersbrought up the rear carrying spare stores ladders and so forth</s>  whenall was ready the lamps were lit and we started upon a very strangejourney</s> for the first two hundred feet or so the stairs though worn and almostperpendicular for the place was like the shaft of a mine were notdifficult to descend to any of us except joshua whom i heard puffingand groaning behind me</s>  then came a gallery running eastward at a steepslope for perhaps fifty paces and at the end of it a second shaft ofabout the same depth as the first but with the stairs much more wornapparently by the washing of water of which a good deal trickled out ofthe sides of the shaft</s>  another difficulty was that the air rushing upfrom below made it hard to keep the lamps alight</s> toward the bottom of this section there was scarcely any stair left andthe climbing became very dangerous</s>  here indeed joshua slipped andwith a wail of terror slid down the shaft and landed with his legsacross my back in such a fashion that had i not happened to havegood hand and foot hold at the time he would have propelled me on tomaqueda and we must have all rolled down headlong probably to ourdeaths</s> as it was this fat and terrified fellow cast his arms about my neck towhich he clung nearly choking me until just when i was about to faintbeneath his weight and pressure the mountaineers in the third partyarrived and dragged him off</s>  when they had got him in charge for irefused to move another step while he was immediately behind me wedescended by a ladder which the first party had set up to the secondlevel where began another long eastward sloping passage that ended atthe mouth of a third pit</s> here arose the great question as to what was to be done with the princejoshua who vowed that he could go no farther and demanded loudly to betaken back to the top of the cliff although shadrach assured him thatthenceforward the road was much easier</s>  at length we were obliged torefer the matter to maqueda who settled it in very few words</s> my uncle she said you tell us that you cannot come on and itis certain that we cannot spare the time and men to send you back</s> therefore it seems that you must stop where you are until we returnand if we should not return make the best of your own way up the shaft</s> farewell my uncle this place is safe and comfortable and if you arewise you will rest awhile</s> heartless woman</s>  gobbled joshua who was shaking like a jelly withfear and rage</s>  would you leave your affianced lord and lover alone inthis haunted hole while you scramble down rocks like a wild cat withstrangers</s>  if i must stay do you stay with me</s> certainly not replied maqueda with decision</s>  shall it be said thatthe child of kings is afraid to go where her guests can travel</s> well the end of it was that joshua came on in the centre of the thirdbody of mountaineers who were practically obliged to carry him</s> shadrach was right since for some reason or other the stairsthenceforward remained more perfect</s>  only they seemed almost endlessand before we reached our goal i calculated that we must have descendedquite twelve hundred feet into the bowels of the rock</s>  at length when iwas almost tired out and maqueda was so breathless that she was obligedto lean on oliver dragging me behind her like a dog on a string of asudden we saw a glimmer of daylight that crept into the tunnel through asmall hole</s>  by the mouth of yet another pit or shaft we found shadrachand the others waiting for us</s>  saluting he said that we must unropeleave our lamps behind and follow him</s>  oliver asked him whither thislast shaft led</s> to a still lower level lord he answered but one which you willscarcely care to explore since it ends in the great pit where the fungkeep their sacred lions</s> indeed said oliver much interested for reasons of his own and heglanced at quick who nodded his head and whistled</s> then we all followed shadrach to find ourselves presently upon a plateauabout the size of a racquet court which either by nature or by the handof man had been recessed into the face of that gigantic cliff</s>  goingto the edge of this plateau whereon grew many treeferns and some thickgreen bushes that would have made us invisible from below even had therebeen any one to see us we saw that the sheer precipice ran down beneathfor several hundred feet</s>  of these yawning depths however we did notat the moment make out much partly because they were plunged in shadowand partly for another reason</s> rising out of the gulf below was what we took at first to be a roundedhill of black rock oblong in shape from which projected a giganticshaft of stone ending in a kind of fretted bush that alone was of thesize of a cottage</s>  the point of this bushlike rock was exactly oppositethe little plateau on to which we had emerged and distant from it notmore than thirty or at most forty feet</s> what is that</s>  asked maqueda of shadrach pointing in front of her asshe handed back to one of the mountaineers a cup from which she had beendrinking water</s> that o walda nagasta he answered is nothing else than the backof the mighty idol of the fung which is shaped like a lion</s>  the greatshaft of rock with the bush at the end of it is the tail of the lion</s> doubtless this platform on which we stand is a place whence the oldpriests when they owned mur as well as the land of the fung used tohide themselves to watch whatever it was they wanted to see</s>  look andhe pointed to certain grooves in the face of the rock i think thathere there was once a bridge which could be let down at will on to thetail of the liongod though long ago it has rotted away</s>  yet ere now ihave travelled this road without it</s> we stared at him astonished and in the silence that followed i heardmaqueda whisper to oliverperhaps that is how he whom we call cat escaped from the fung orperhaps that is how he communicates with them as a spy</s> or perhaps he is a liar my lady interrupted quick who had alsooverheard their talk a solution which i confess commended itself tome</s> why have you brought us here</s>  asked maqueda presently</s> did i not tell you in mur ladyto rescue black windows</s>  listen nowit is the custom of the fung to allow those who are imprisoned withinthe idol to walk unguarded upon its back at dawn and sunset</s>  at leastthis is their custom with black windowsask me not how i know it thisis truth i swear it on my life which is at stake</s>  now this is my plan</s> we have with us a ladder which will reach from where we stand to thetail of the idol</s>  should the foreign lord appear upon the back of thegod which if he still lives as i believe he does he is almost sureto do at sundown as a man who dwells in the dark all day will love thelight and air when he can get them then some of us must cross and bringhim back with us</s>  perhaps it had best be you my lord orme since ifi went alone or even with these men after what is past black windowsmight not altogether trust me</s> fool broke in maqueda how can a man do such a thing</s> o lady it is not so difficult as it looks</s>  a few steps across thegulf and then a hundred feet or so along the tail of the lion whichis flat on the top and so broad that one may run down it if careful tofollow the curves that is on a still daynothing more</s>  but of courseif the lord orme is afraid which i did not think who have heard so muchof his courage and the rogue shrugged his shoulders and paused</s> afraid fellow said oliver well i am not ashamed to be afraid ofsuch a journey</s>  yet if there is need i will make it though not beforei see my brother alone yonder on the rock since all this may be buta trick of yours to deliver me to the fung among whom i know that youhave friends</s> it is madness you shall not go said maqueda</s>  you will fall and bedashed to pieces</s>  i say that you shall not go</s> why should he not go my niece</s>  interrupted joshua</s>  shadrach isright we have heard much of the courage of this gentile</s>  now let us seehim do something</s> she turned on the prince like a tiger</s> very good my uncle then you shall go with him</s>  surely one of theancient blood of the abati will not shirk from what a gentile dares</s> on hearing this joshua relapsed into silence and i have no clear memoryof what he did or said in connection with the rest of that thrillingscene</s> now followed a pause in the midst of which oliver sat down and began totake off his boots</s> why do you undress yourself friend</s>  asked maqueda nervously</s> because lady he answered if i have to walk yonder road it is saferto do so in my stockings</s>  have no fear he added gently from boyhoodi have been accustomed to such feats and when i served in my countrysarmy it was my pleasure to give instruction in them although it is truethat this one surpasses all that ever i attempted</s> still i do fear she said</s> meanwhile quick had sat down and begun to take off his boots</s> what are you doing sergeant</s>  i asked</s> getting ready to accompany the captain upon forlorn hope doctor</s> nonsense i said you are too old for the game sergeant</s>  if any onegoes i should seeing that i believe my son is over there but i canttry it as i know my head would give out and i should fall in a secondwhich would only upset everybody</s> of course broke in oliver who had overheard us im in commandhere and my orders are that neither of you shall come</s>  remembersergeant that if anything happens to me it is your business to takeover the stores and use them if necessary which you alone can do</s>  nowgo and see to the preparations and find out the plan of campaign for iwant to rest and keep quiet</s>  i daresay the whole thing is humbug and weshall see nothing of the professor still one may as well be prepared</s> so quick and i went to superintend the lashing of two of the lightladders together and the securing of some planks which we had broughtwith us upon the top of the rungs so as to make these ladders easy towalk on</s>  i asked who would be of the party besides shadrach and ormeand was told no one as all were afraid</s>  ultimately however a mannamed japhet one of the mountaineers volunteered upon being promiseda grant of land from the child of kings herself which grant sheproclaimed before them all was to be given to his relatives in the eventof his death</s> at length everything was ready and there came another spell of silencefor the nerves of all of us were so strained that we did not seem ableto talk</s>  it was broken by a sound of sudden and terrible roaring thatarose from the gulf beneath</s> it is the hour of the feeding of the sacred lions which the fung keepin the pit about the base of the idol explained shadrach</s>  then headded unless he should be rescued i believe that black windowswill be given to the lions tonight which is that of full moon and afestival of harmac though maybe he will be kept till the next full moonwhen all the fung come up to worship</s> this information did not tend to raise anyones spirits although quickwho always tried to be cheerful remarked that it was probably false</s> the shadows began to gather in the valley of harmac whereby we knewthat the sun was setting behind the mountains</s>  indeed had it not beenfor a clear and curious glow reflected from the eastern sky the gulfwould have plunged us in gloom</s>  presently far away upon a rise of rockwhich we knew must be the sphinx head of the huge idol a little figureappeared outlined against the sky and there began to sing</s>  the momentthat i heard the distant voice i went near to fainting and indeedshould have fallen had not quick caught me</s> what is it adams</s>  asked oliver looking up from where he and maquedasat whispering to each other while the fat joshua glowered at them inthe background</s>  has higgs appeared</s> no i answered but thank god my son still lives</s>  that is hisvoice</s>  oh</s>  if you can save him too</s> now there was much suppressed excitement and some one thrust a pairof fieldglasses into my hand but either they were wrongly set or thestate of my nerves would not allow me to see through them</s>  so quick tookthem and reported</s> tall slim figure wearing a white robe but at the distance in thislight cant make out the face</s>  one might hail him perhaps only itwould give us away</s>  ah</s>  the hymn is done and hes gone seemed to jumpinto a hole in the rock which shows that hes all right anyway orhe couldnt jump</s>  so cheer up doctor for you have much to be thankfulfor</s> yes i repeated after him much to be thankful for but still i wouldthat i had more after all these years to search</s>  to think that i shouldbe so close to him and he know nothing of it</s> after the ceasing of the song and the departure of my son thereappeared upon the back of the idol three fung warriors fine fellowsclad in long robes and armed with spears and behind them a trumpeterwho carried a horn or hollowed elephants tusk</s>  these men marched up anddown the length of the platform from the rise of the neck to the root ofthe tail apparently to make an inspection</s>  having found nothing forof course they could not see us hidden behind the bushes on our littleplateau of which no doubt they did not even know the existence andmuch less that it was connected with the mountain plain of mur thetrumpeter blew a shrill blast upon his horn and before the echoes of ithad died away vanished with his companions</s> sunset tour of inspection</s>  seen the same kind of thing as at gib</s> said the sergeant</s>  oh</s>  by jingo</s>  pussy isnt lying after alltherehe is and he pointed to a figure that rose suddenly out of the blackstone of the idols back just as the guards had done</s> it was higgs higgs without a doubt higgs wearing his batteredsunhelmet and his dark spectacles higgs smoking his big meerschaumpipe and engaged in making notes in a pocketbook as calmly as thoughhe sat before a new object in the british museum</s> i gasped with astonishment for somehow i had never expected that weshould really see him but orme rising very quietly from his seatbeside maqueda only saidyes thats the old fellow right enough</s>  well now for it</s>  youshadrach run out your ladder and cross first that i may be sure youplay no trick</s> nay broke in maqueda this dog shall not go for never would hereturn from his friends the fung</s>  man she said addressing japhet themountaineer to whom she had promised land go you over first and holdthe end of the ladder while this lord crosses</s>  if he returns safe yourreward is doubled</s> japhet saluted the ladder was run out and its end set upon theroughnesses in the rock that represented the hair of the sphinxs tail</s> the mountaineer paused a moment with hands and face uplifted evidentlyhe was praying</s>  then bidding his companions hold the hither end of theladder and having first tested it with his foot and found that it hungfirm calmly he walked across being a brave fellow and presently wasseen seated on the opposing mass of rock</s> now came olivers turn</s>  he nodded to maqueda who went white as a sheetmuttering some words to her that did not reach me</s>  then he turned andshook my hand</s> if you can save my son also i whispered</s> ill do my best if i can get hold of him he answered</s>  sergeant ifanything happens to me you know your duty</s> ill try and follow your example captain under all circumstancesthough that will be hard replied quick in a rather shaky voice</s> oliver stepped out on the ladder</s>  i reckoned that twelve or fourteenshort paces would take him across and the first half of these heaccomplished with quiet certainty</s>  when he was in the exact middle ofthe passage however the end of one of the uprights of the ladder atthe farther side slipped a little notwithstanding the efforts of japhetto keep it straight with the result that the plank bound on the rungslost its level sinking an inch or so to the right and nearly causingoliver to fall from it into the gulf</s>  he wavered like a windshakenreed attempted to step forward hesitated stopped and slowly sank onto his hands and knees</s> ah</s>  panted maqueda</s> the gentile has lost his head began joshua in a voice full of thetriumph that he could not hide</s>  hewilljoshua got no further for quick turning threatened him savagely withhis fist saying in englishstow your jaw if you dont want to follow him you swine whereonjoshua who understood the gesture if not the words relapsed intosilence</s> now the mountaineer on the farther side spoke sayinghave no fear the ladder is safe</s> for a moment oliver remained in his crouching posture on the boardwhich was all that separated him from an awful death in the gulfbeneath</s>  next while we watched agonized he rose to his feet againand with perfect calmness walked across to its other end</s> well done our side</s>  said quick addressing joshua why dont yourroyal highness cheer</s>  no you leave that knife alone or presentlytherell be a hog the less in this world and stooping down he relievedthe prince of the weapon which he was fingering with his round eyesfixed upon the sergeant</s> maqueda who had noted all now interfered</s> my uncle she said brave men are risking their lives yonder while wesit in safety</s>  be silent and cease from quarrelling i pray you</s> next moment we had forgotten all about joshua being utterly absorbed inwatching the drama in progress upon the farther side of the gulf</s>  aftera slight pause to recover his nerve or breath orme rose and precededby japhet climbed up the bushlike rock till he reached the shaftof the sphinxs tail</s>  here he turned and waved his hand to usthen following the mountaineer walked apparently with the utmostconfidence along the curves of the tail to where it sprang from thebody of the idol</s>  at this spot there was a little difficulty in climbingover the smooth slope of rock on to the broad terracelike back</s>  soonhowever they surmounted it and vanishing for a few seconds intothe hollow of the loins which of course was a good many feet deepreappeared moving toward the shoulders</s>  between these we could seehiggs standing with his back toward us utterly unconscious of all thatwas passing behind him</s> passing japhet oliver walked up to the professor and touched him onthe arm</s>  higgs turned stared at the pair for a moment and then inhis astonishment or so we guessed sat down plump upon the rock</s>  theypulled him to his feet orme pointing to the cliff behind and evidentlyexplaining the situation and what must be done</s>  then followed a shortand animated talk</s>  through the glasses we could even see higgs shakinghis head</s>  he told them something they came to a determination fornow he turned stepped forward a pace or two and vanished as i learntafterwards to fetch my son without whom he would not try to escape</s> a while went by it seemed an age but really was under a minute</s>  weheard the sound of shouts</s>  higgss white helmet reappeared and then hisbody with two fung guards clinging on to him</s>  he yelled out in englishand the words reached us faintlysave yourself</s>  ill hold these devils</s>  run you infernal fool run</s> oliver hesitated although the mountaineer was pulling at him till theheads of more fung appeared</s>  then with a gesture of despair he turnedand fled</s>  first ran oliver then japhet whom he had outpaced and afterthem came a number of priests or guards waving knives while in thebackground higgs rolled on the rock with his captors</s> the rest was very short</s>  orme slid down the rump of the idol on to thetail followed by the mountaineer and after them in single file camethree fung who apparently thought no more of the perilous nature oftheir foothold than do the sheiks of the egyptian pyramids when theyswarm about those monuments like lizards</s>  nor for the matter of thatdid oliver or japhet who doubled down the tail as though it were a racetrack</s>  oliver swung himself on to the ladder and in a second washalf across it we holding its other end when suddenly he heard hiscompanion cry out</s>  a fung had got hold of japhet by the leg and he layface downward on the board</s> oliver halted and slowly turned round drawing his revolver as he didso</s>  then he aimed and fired and the fung leaving go of japhets legthrew up his arms and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath</s>  the nextthing i remember is that they were both among us and somebody shoutedpull in the ladder</s> no said quick wait a bit</s> vaguely i wondered why till i perceived that three of those courageousfung were following across it resting their hands upon each othersshoulders while their companions cheered them</s> now pull brothers pull</s>  shouted the sergeant and pull we did</s>  poorfung</s>  they deserved a better fate</s> always inflict loss upon the enemy when you get a chance remarked thesergeant as he opened fire with his repeating rifle upon other fungwho by now were clustering upon the back of the idol</s>  this positionhowever they soon abandoned as untenable except one or two of them whoremained there dead or wounded</s> a silence followed in the midst of which i heard quick saying to joshuain his very worst arabicnow does your royal highness think that we gentiles are cowardsalthough it is true those fung are as good men as we any day</s> joshua declined argument and i turned to watch oliver who had coveredhis face with his hands and seemed to be weeping</s> what is it o friend what is it</s>  i heard maqueda say in her gentlevoicea voice full of tears tears of gratitude i think</s>  you have donea great deed you have returned safe all is well</s> nay he answered forgetting her titles in his distress all is ill</s> i have failed and tonight they throw my brother to the lions</s>  he toldme so</s> maqueda finding no answer stretched out her hand to the mountaineerhis companion in adventure who kissed it</s> japhet she said i am proud of you your reward is fourfold andhenceforth you are a captain of my mountaineers</s> tell us what happened i said to oliver</s> this he answered i remembered about your son and so did higgs</s>  infact he spoke of him firstthey seem to have become friends</s>  he saidhe would not escape without him and could fetch him in a moment ashe was only just below</s>  well he went to do so and must have found theguard instead who i suppose had heard us talking</s>  you know as muchabout the rest as i do</s>  tonight when the full moon is two hours highthere is to be a ceremony of sacrifice and poor higgs will be let downinto the den of lions</s>  he was writing his will in a notebook when wesaw him as barung had promised to send it to us</s> doctor said the sergeant in a confidential voice when he haddigested this information would you translate for me a bit as i wantto have a talk with cat there and my arabic dont run to it</s> i nodded and we went to that corner of the plateau where shadrach stoodapart watching and listening</s> now cat said the sergeant i give his remarks in his own languageleaving out my rendering just listen to me and understand that ifyou tell lies or play games either you or i dont reach the top of thiscliff again alive</s>  do you catch on</s> shadrach replied that he caught on</s> very well</s>  youve told us that once you were a prisoner among thefung and thrown to these holy lions but got out</s>  now just explain whathappened</s> this o quick</s>  after ceremonies that do not matter i was let down inthe foodbasket into the feedingden and thrown out of the basket likeany other meat</s>  then the gates were lifted up by the chains and thelions came in to devour me according to their custom</s> and what happened next shadrach</s> what happened</s>  why of course i hid myself in the shadow as much aspossible right against the walls of the precipice until a satan ofa shelion snuffled me out and gave a stroke at me</s>  look here are themarks of her claws and he pointed to the scars upon his face</s>  thoseclaws stung like scorpions they made me mad</s>  the terror which i hadlost when i saw their yellow eyes came back to me</s>  i rushed at theprecipice as a cat that is hunted by a dog rushes at a wall</s>  i clungto its smooth side with my nails with my toes with my teeth</s>  a lionleaped up and tore the flesh of my leg here here and he showed themarks which we could scarcely see in that dim light</s>  he ran back foranother spring</s>  above me i saw a tiny ledge big enough for a hawk tosit onno more</s>  i jumped i caught it drawing up my legs so that thelion missed me</s>  i made the effort a man makes once in his life</s>  somehowi dragged myself to that ledge i rested one thigh upon it and pressedagainst the rock to steady myself</s>  then the rock gave and i tumbledbackward into the bottom of a tunnel</s>  afterwards i escaped to the topof the cliff in the dark o god of israel</s>  in the dark smelling my wayclimbing like a baboon risking death a thousand times</s>  it took me twowhole days and nights and the last of those nights i knew not what idid</s>  yet i found my way and that is why my people name me cat</s> i understand said quick in a new and more respectful voice andhowever big a rascal you may be youve got pluck</s>  now say rememberingwhat i told you and he tapped the handle of his revolver is thatfeedingden where it used to be</s> i believe so o quick why should it be changed</s>  the victims are letdown from the belly of the god just there between his thighs where aredoors</s>  the feedingplace lies in a hollow of the cliff this platform onwhich we stand is over it</s>  none saw my escape therefore none searchedfor the means of it since they thought that the lions had devouredme as they have devoured thousands</s>  no one enters there only when thebeasts have fed full they draw back to their sleepingdens and thosewho watch above let down the bars</s>  listen and as he spoke we heard acrash and a rattle far below</s>  they fall now the lions having eaten</s> when black windows and perhaps others are thrown to them by and bythey will be drawn up again</s> is that hole in the rock still there shadrach</s> without doubt though i have not been down to look</s> then my boy you are going now remarked quick grimly</s> chapter xiithe den of lionswe returned to the others and told them everything that we had learnedfrom shadrach</s> whats your plan sergeant</s>  asked oliver when he had heard</s>  tell mefor i have none my head is muddled</s> this captain for what it is worth that i should go down through thehole that cat here speaks of and get into the den</s>  then when they letdown the professor if they do and pull up the gates that i shouldkeep back the lions with my rifle while he bolts to the ladder which isready for him and i follow if i can</s> capital said orme but you cant go alone</s>  ill come too</s> and i also i said</s> what schemes do you make</s>  asked maqueda eagerly for of course shecould not understand our talk</s> we explained</s> what my friend she said to oliver reproachfully would you riskyour life again tonight</s>  surely it is tempting the goodness of god</s> it would be tempting the goodness of god much more if i left my friendto be eaten by lions lady he answered</s> then followed much discussions</s>  in the end it was agreed that we shoulddescend to the level of the den if this were possible that oliver andquick should go down into the den with japhet who instantly volunteeredto accompany them and that i with some of the mountaineers shouldstop in the mouth of the hole as a reserve to cover their retreat fromthe lions</s>  i pleaded to be allowed to take a more active part but ofthis they would not hear saying with some truth that i was by far thebest shot of the three and could do much more to help them from aboveif as was hoped the moon should shine brightly</s> but i knew they really meant that i was too old to be of service in suchan adventure as this</s>  also they desired to keep me out of risk</s> then came the question as to who should descend the last tunnel to theplace of operations</s>  oliver wished maqueda to return to the top of thecliff and wait there but she said at once that she could not think ofattempting the ascent without our aid also that she was determined tosee the end of the matter</s>  even joshua would not go i think that beingan unpopular character among them he distrusted the mountaineers whoseduty it would have been to escort him</s> it was suggested that he should remain where he was until we returnedif we did return but this idea commended itself to him still less thanthe other</s>  indeed he pointed out with much truth what we had overlookednamely that now the fung knew of the passage and were quite capableof playing our own game that is of throwing a bridge across from thesphinxs tail and attempting the storm of mur</s> and then what should i do if they found me here alone</s>  he addedpathetically</s> maqueda answered that she was sure she did not know but that meanwhileit might be wise to block the mouth of the tunnel by which we hadreached the plateau in such a fashion that it could not easily beforced</s> yes answered oliver and if we ever get out of this to blow theshaft in and make sure that it cannot be used</s> that shaft might be useful captain said quick doubtfully</s> there is a better way sergeant if we want to mine under the sphinxi mean through the tomb of kings</s>  i took the levels roughly and the endof it cant be far off</s>  anyhow this shaft is of no more use to us nowthat the fung have found it out</s> then we set to work to fill in the mouth of the passage with such loosestones as we could find</s>  it was a difficult business but in the end themountaineers made a very fair job of it under our direction piling therocks in such a fashion that they could scarcely be cleared away in anyshort time without the aid of explosives</s>
 to our relief just as we had finished building upthe hole they returned with the news that now after they had removed afallen stone or two it was quite practicable with the aid of ropes andladders</s> so in the same order as before we commenced its passage and in abouthalfanhour for it was under three hundred feet in depth arrivedsafely at the foot</s>  here we found a bathaunted place like a room thatevidently had been hollowed out by man</s>  as shadrach had said at itseastern extremity was a large oblong boulder so balanced that if evenone person pushed on either of its ends it swung around leaving oneach side a passage large enough to allow a man to walk through in acrouching attitude</s> very silently we propped open this primval door and looked out</s>  now thefull moon was up and her brilliant light had begun to flood the gulf</s> by it we saw a dense shadow that reached from the ground to threehundred feet or so above us</s>  this we knew to be that thrown by theflanks of the gigantic sphinx which projected beyond the mountain ofstone whereon it rested those flanks whence according to shadrachhiggs would be lowered in a foodbasket</s>  in this shadow and on eitherside of it covering a space of quite a hundred yards square lay thefeedingden whence arose a sickly and horrible odour such as is commonto any place frequented by cats mingled with the more pungent smell ofdecaying flesh</s> this darksome den was surrounded on three sides by precipices and onthe fourth that toward the east enclosed by a wall or barrier of rockpierced with several gates made of bars of metal or so we judged by thelight that flowed through them</s> from beyond this eastern wall came dreadful sounds of roars snarls andwhimperings</s>  evidently there the sacred lions had their home</s> only one more thing need be mentioned</s>  on the rock floor almostimmediately beneath us lay remains which from their torn clothes andhair we knew must be human</s>  as somebody explained i think it wasshadrach they were those of the man whom orme had shot upon the tail ofthe sphinx and of his companions who had been tilted off the ladder</s> for awhile we gazed at this horrible hole in silence</s>  then oliver tookout his watch which was a repeater and struck it</s> higgs told me he said that he was to be thrown to the lions twohours after moonrise which is within fifteen minutes or so</s>  sergeant ithink we had better be getting ready</s> yes captain answered quick but everything is quite readyincluding those brutes to judge by the noise they make exceptingperhaps samuel quick who never felt less ready for anything in hislife</s>  now then pussy run out that ladder</s>  heres your rifle captainand six reload clips of cartridges five hollownosed bullets in each</s> youll never want more than that and its no use carrying extra weight</s> in your righthand pocket captain dont forget</s>  ive the same in mine</s> doctor heres a pile for you laid upon that stone</s>  if you lie thereyoull have a good light and rest for your elbow and at this rangeought to make very pretty shooting even in the moonlight</s>  best keepyour pistol on the safe captain at least im doing so as we mightget a fall and these newfangled weapons are very hairtriggered</s> heres japhet ready too so give us your marching orders sir and wewill go to business the doctor will translate to japhet</s> we descend the ladder said orme and advance about fifty paces intothe shadow where we can see without being seen where also accordingto shadrach the foodbasket is let down</s>  there we shall stand and awaitthe arrival of this basket</s>  if it contains the professor he whom thefung and the abati know as black windows japhet you are to seize himand lead or if necessary carry him to the ladder up which some of themountaineers must be ready to help him</s>  your duty sergeant and minealso that of the doctor firing from above will be to keep off the lionsas best we can should any lions appear retreating as we fire</s>  if thebrutes get one of us he must be left since it is foolish that bothlives should be sacrificed needlessly</s>  for the rest you sergeantand you japhet must be guided by circumstances and act upon your owndiscretion</s>  do not wait for special orders from me which i may not beable to give</s>  now come on</s>  if we do not return adams you will see thechild of kings safely up the shafts and conduct her to mur</s>  goodbyelady</s> goodbye answered maqueda in a brave voice i could not see herface in the darkness</s>  presently i am sure you will return with yourbrother</s> just then joshua broke ini will not be outdone in courage by these gentiles he said</s>  lackingtheir terrible weapons i cannot advance into the den but i willdescend and guard the foot of the ladder</s> very well sir answered orme in an astonished voice glad to haveyour company i am sure</s>  only remember that you must be quick in goingup it again since hungry lions are active and let all take notice thatwe are not responsible for anything that may happen to you</s> surely you had better stop where you are my uncle remarked maqueda</s> to be mocked by you for ever after my niece</s>  no i go to face thelions and very slowly he crept through the hole and began to descendthe ladder</s>  indeed when quick followed after an interval he foundhim only halfway down and had to hurry his movements by accidentallytreading on his fingers</s> a minute or two later peeping over the edge i saw that they were allin the den that is except joshua who had reascended the ladder to theheight of about six feet and stood on it face outward holding to therock on either side with his hands as though he had been crucified</s> fearing lest he should be seen there even in the shadow i suggested tomaqueda that she should order him either to go down or to return whichshe did vigorously but without effect</s>  so in the end we left him alone</s> meanwhile the three had vanished into the shadow of the sphinx and wecould see nothing of them</s>  the great round moon rose higher and higherflooding the rest of the charnelhouse with light and save for anoccasional roar or whimper from the lions beyond the wall the silencewas intense</s>  now i could make out the metal gates in this wall and evendark and stealthy forms which passed and repassed beyond their bars</s> then i made out something else also the figures of men gathering on thetop of the wall though whence they came i knew not</s>  by degrees theirnumber increased till there were hundreds of them for the wall wasbroad as a roadway</s> evidently these were spectators come to witness the ceremony ofsacrifice</s> prince i whispered to joshua you must get down off the ladder oryou will betray us all</s>  nay it is too late to come up here again foralready the moonlight strikes just above your head</s>  go down or we willcast the ladder loose and let you fall</s> so he went down and hid himself among some ferns and bushes where wesaw no more of him for a while and to tell the truth forgot hisexistence</s> far far above us from the back of the idol i suppose came a faintsound of solemn chanting</s>  it sank and we heard shouts</s>  then suddenlyit swelled again</s>  now maqueda who knelt near me touched my arm andpointed to the shadow which gradually was becoming infiltrated with themoonlight flowing into it from either side</s>  i looked and high inthe air perhaps two hundred feet from the ground saw something darkdescending slowly</s>  doubtless it was the basket containing higgs andwhether by coincidence or no at this moment the lions on the fartherside of the wall burst into peal upon peal of terrific roaring</s>  perhapstheir sentries watching at the gate saw or smelt the familiar basketand communicated the intelligence to their fellows</s> slowly slowly it descended till it was within a few feet of theground when it began to sway backward and forward like a pendulum ateach swing covering a wider arc</s>  presently when it hung over the edgeof the shadow that was nearest to us it was let down with a run andoverset and out of it looking very small in those vast surroundingsand that mysterious light rolled the figure of a man</s>  although atthat distance we could see little of him accident assured us of hisidentity for as he rolled the hat he wore fell from him and i knewit at once for higgss sunhelmet</s>  he rose from the ground limped veryslowly and painfully after the helmet picked it up and proceeded touse it to dust his knees</s>  at this moment there was a clanking sound</s> oh</s>  they lift the gates</s>  murmured maqueda</s> then followed more sounds this time of wild beasts raging for theirprey and of other human beasts shrieking with excitement on the wallabove</s>  the professor turned and saw</s>  for a moment he seemed about torun then changed his mind clapped the helmet on his head folded hisarms and stood still reminding me in some curious way perhaps becauseof the shortness of his thick figure of a picture i had seen of thegreat napoleon contemplating a disaster</s> to describe what followed is extremely difficult for we watched notone but several simultaneous scenes</s>  for instance there were the lionswhich did not behave as might have been expected</s>  i thought that theywould rush through the doors and bound upon the victim but whether itwas because they had already been fed that afternoon or because theythought that a single human being was not worth the trouble they acteddifferently</s> through the open gates they came in two indolent yellow lines malelions female lions halfgrown lions cub lions that cuffed each otherin play in all perhaps fifty or sixty of them</s>  of these only two orthree looked towards the professor for none of them ran or gallopedwhile the rest spread over the den some of them vanishing into theshadow at the edge of the surrounding cliff where the moonlight couldnot reach</s> here one of them at any rate must have travelled fast enough for itseemed only a few seconds later that we heard a terrific yell beneathus and craning over the rock i saw the prince joshua running up theladder more swiftly than ever did any london lamplighter when i was aboy</s> but quickly as he came the long thin sinuous thing beneath camequicker</s>  it reared itself on its hind legs it stretched up a greatpawi can see the gleaming claws in it nowand struck or hooked atpoor joshua</s>  the paw caught him in the small of the back and seemedto pin him against the ladder</s>  then it was drawn slowly downwardand heaven</s>  how joshua howled</s>  up came the other paw to repeat theoperation when stretching myself outward and downward with an abatiholding me by the ankles i managed to shoot the beast through thehead so that it fell all of a heap taking with it a large portion ofjoshuas nether garments</s> a few seconds later he was among us and tumbled groaning into a cornerwhere he lay in charge of some of the mountaineers for i had no time toattend to him just then</s> when the smoke cleared at length i saw that japhet had reached higgsand was gesticulating to him to run while two lions a male and afemale stood at a little distance regarding the pair in an interestedfashion</s>  higgs after some brief words of explanation pointed to hisknee</s>  evidently he was lamed and could not run</s>  japhet rising to theoccasion pointed to his back and bent down</s>  higgs flung himself uponit and was hitched up like a sack of flour</s>  the pair began to advancetoward the ladder japhet carrying higgs as one schoolboy carriesanother</s> the lion sat down like a great dog watching this strange proceedingwith mild interest but the lioness filled with feminine curiosityfollowed sniffing at higgs who looked over his shoulder</s>  taking off hisbattered helmet he threw it at the beast hitting her on the head</s> she growled then seized the helmet playing with it for a moment asa kitten does with a ball of wool and next instant finding itunsatisfying uttered a short and savage roar ran forward and crouchedto spring lashing her tail</s>  i could not fire because a bullet thatwould hit her must first pass through japhet and higgs</s> but just when i thought that the end had come a rifle went off in theshadow and she rolled over kicking and biting the rock</s>  thereon theindolent male lion seemed to awake and sprang not at the men but atthe wounded lioness and a hellish fight ensued of which the detailsand end were lost in a mist of dust and flying hair</s> the crowd upon the wall becoming alive to the real situation began toscream in indignant excitement which quickly communicated itself tothe less savage beasts</s>  these set up a terrible roaring and ran aboutkeeping for the most part to the shadows while japhet and his burdenmade slow but steady progress toward the ladder</s> then from the gloom beneath the hindquarters of the sphinx rose asound of rapid firing and presently orme and quick emerged into themoonlight followed by a number of angry lions that advanced in shortrushes</s>  evidently the pair had kept their heads and were acting on aplan</s> one of them emptied his rifle at the pursuing beasts while the otherran back a few paces thrusting in a fresh clip of cartridges as hewent</s>  then he began to fire and his companion in turn retreated behindhim</s>  in this way they knocked over a number of lions for the range wastoo short for them to miss often and the expanding bullets did theirwork very well paralyzing even when they did not kill</s>  i also openedfire over their heads and although in that uncertain light themajority of my shots did no damage the others disposed of severalanimals which i saw were becoming dangerous</s> so things went on until all four that is japhet with higgs uponhis back and orme and quick were within twenty paces of the ladderalthough separated from each other by perhaps half the length of acricket pitch</s>  we thought that they were safe and shouted in our joywhile the hundreds of spectators on the wall who fortunately dared notdescend into the den because of the lions which are undiscriminatingbeasts yelled with rage at the imminent rescue of the sacrifice</s> then of a sudden the position changed</s>  from every quarter fresh lionsseemed to arrive ringing the men round and clearly bent on slaughteralthough the shouting and the sound of firearms which they had neverheard before frightened them and made them cautious</s> a halfgrown cub rushed in and knocked over japhet and higgs</s>  i firedand hit it in the flank</s>  it bit savagely at its wound then sprang on tothe prostrate pair and stood over them growling but in such pain thatit forgot to kill them</s>  the ring of beasts closed inwe could see theiryellow eyes glowing in the gloom</s>  orme and quick might have got throughby the help of their rifles but they could not leave the others</s>  thedreadful climax seemed at hand</s> follow me said maqueda who all this while had watched panting at myside and rose to run to the ladder</s>  i thrust her back</s> nay i shouted</s>  follow me abati</s>  shall a woman lead you</s> of how i descended that ladder i have no recollection nor do i in theleast know how the mountaineers came after me but i think that the mostof them rolled and scrambled down the thirty feet of rock</s>  at least totheir honour be it said they did come yelling like demons and wavinglong knives in their hands</s> the effect of our sudden arrival from above was extraordinary</s>  scaredby the rush and the noise the lions gave way then bolted in everydirection the wounded cub which could not or would not move beingstabbed to death where it stood over higgs and japhet</s> five minutes more and all of us were safe in the mouth of the tunnel</s> that was how we rescued higgs from the den of the sacred lions whichguarded the idol of the fung</s> chapter xiiithe adventures of higgsa more weary and dishevelled set of people than that which about thehour of dawn finally emerged from the mouth of the ancient shaft on tothe cliffs of mur it has seldom been my lot to behold</s>  yet with a singleexception the party was a happy one for we had come triumphant throughgreat dangers and actually effected our objectthe rescue ofhiggs which under the circumstances most people would have thoughtimpossible</s>  yes there he was in the flesh before us having injured hisknee and lost his hat but otherwise quite sound save for a few triflingscratches inflicted by the cub and still wearing what the nativescalled his black windows</s> even the prince joshua was happy though wrapped in a piece of coarsesacking because the lion had taken most of his posterior clothing andterribly sore from the deep cuts left by the claws</s> had he not dared the dangers of the den and thus proved himself a herowhose fame would last for generations</s>  had i not assured him that hishonourable wounds though painful as a matter of fact after they hadset they kept him stiff as a mummy for some days so that unless hestood upon his feet he had to be carried or lie rigid on his facewould probably not prove fatal</s>  and had he not actually survived toreach the upper air again which was more than he ever expected to do</s> no wonder that he was happy</s> i alone could not share in the general joy since although my friendwas restored to me my son still remained a prisoner among the fung</s>  yeteven in this matter things might have been worse since i learnedthat he was well treated and in no danger</s>  but of that i will writepresently</s> never shall i forget the scene after the arrival of higgs in our holewhen the swinging boulder had been closed and made secure and the lampslighted</s>  there he sat on the floor his red hair glowing like a torchhis clothes torn and bloody his beard ragged and stretching in anewgate frill to his ears</s>  indeed his whole appearance accentuated bythe blue spectacles with wire gauze sidepieces was more disreputablethan words can tell moreover he smelt horribly of lion</s>  he put hishand into his pocket and produced his big pipe which had remainedunbroken in its case</s> some tobacco please he said</s>
 those were his first words to us</s>  ihave finished mine saved up the last to smoke just before they put meinto that stinking basket</s>
i gave him some and as he lit his pipe the light of the match fell uponthe face of maqueda who was staring at him with amused astonishment</s> what an uncommonly pretty woman he said</s>  whats she doing down hereand who is she</s> i told him whereon he rose or rather tried to felt for his hatwhich of course had gone with the idea of taking it off andinstantly addressed her in his beautiful and fluent arabic saying howglad he was to have this unexpected honour and so forth</s> she congratulated him on his escape whereon his face grew serious</s> yes a nasty business he said as yet i can hardly remember whethermy name is daniel or ptolemy higgs</s>  then he turned to us and addedlook here you fellows if i dont thank you it isnt because i am notgrateful but because i cant</s>  the truth is im a bit dazed</s>  your sonis all right adams hes a good fellow and we grew great friends</s> safe</s>  oh</s>  yes hes safe as a church</s>  old barung hes the sultan andanother good fellow although he did throw me to the lionsbecause thepriests made himis very fond of him and is going to marry him to hisdaughter</s> at this moment the men announced that everything was ready for ourascent and when i had attended to joshua with a heart made thankful byhiggss news we began that toilsome business and as i have alreadysaid at length accomplished it safely</s>  but even then our labours werenot ended since it was necessary to fill up the mouth of the shaft soas to make it impossible that it should be used by the fung who nowknew of its existence</s> nor was this a business that could be delayed for as we passed theplateau whence oliver and japhet had crossed to the sphinx we heard thevoices of men on the farther side of the rough wall that we had builtthere</s>  evidently the priests or idol guards infuriated by the rescueof their victim had already managed to bridge the gulf and werecontemplating assault a knowledge which caused us to hurry ourmovements considerably</s>  if they had got through before we passed themour fate would have been terrible since at the best we must have slowlystarved in the pit below</s> indeed as soon as we reached the top and had blocked it temporarilyquick weary as he was was sent off on horseback accompanied bymaqueda shadrach now under the terms of his contract once more a freeman and two mountaineers to gallop to the palace of mur and fetch asupply of explosives</s>  the rest of us for higgs declined to leave andwe had no means of carrying joshua remained watching the place orrather the abati watched while we slept with our rifles in our hands</s> before noon quick returned accompanied by many men with litters and allthings needful</s> then we pulled out the stones and oliver japhet and some othersdescended to the first level and arranged blasting charges</s>  awhile afterhe reappeared with his companions looking somewhat pale and anxiousand shouted to us to get back</s>  following our retreat to a certaindistance unwinding a wire as he came presently he stopped and pressedthe button of a battery which he held in his hand</s>  there was a muffledexplosion and a tremor of the soil like to that of an earthquake whilefrom the mouth of the shaft stones leapt into the air</s> it was over and all that could be noted was a sinkage in the groundwhere the ancient pit had been</s> i am sorry for them said oliver presently but it had to be done</s> sorry for whom</s>  i asked</s> for those fung priests or soldiers</s>  the levels below are full of themdead or alive</s>  they were pouring up at our heels</s>  well no one willtravel that road again</s> later in the guest house at mur higgs told us his story</s>  after hisbetrayal by shadrach which it appeared was meant to include us allfor the professor overheard the hurried talk between him and a fungcaptain he was seized and imprisoned in the body of the great sphinxwhere many chambers and dungeons had been hollowed out by the primvalrace that fashioned it</s>  here barung the sultan visited him and informedhim of his meeting with the rest of us to whom apparently he had takena great liking and also that we had refused to purchase a chance of hisrelease at the price of being false to our trust</s> you know said higgs that when first i heard this i was very angrywith you and thought you a set of beasts</s>  but on considering thingsi saw the other side of it and that you were right although i nevercould come to fancy the idea of being sacrificed to a sphinx by beingchucked like a piece of horseflesh to a lot of holy lions</s>  howeverbarung an excellent fellow in his way assured me that there was noroad out of the matter without giving grave offence to the priests whoare very powerful among the fung and bringing a fearful curse on thenation</s> meanwhile he made me as comfortable as he could</s>  for instance iwas allowed to walk upon the back of the idol to associate with thepriests a suspicious and most exclusive set and to study their entirereligious system from which i have no doubt that of egypt was derived</s> indeed i have made a great discovery which if ever we get out of thiswill carry my name down to all generations</s>  the forefathers ofthese fung were undoubtedly also the forefathers of the predynasticegyptians as is shown by the similarity of their customs and spiritualtheories</s>  further intercourse was kept up between the fung who thenhad their headquarters here in mur and the egyptians in the time ofthe ancient empire till the twentieth dynasty indeed if not later</s> my friends in the dungeons in which i was confined there is aninscription or rather a graffite made by a prisoner extradited tomur by rameses ii</s>  after twenty years residence in egypt which waswritten by him on the night before he was thrown to the sacred lionsthat even in those days were an established institution</s>  and i have gota copy of that inscription in my pocketbook</s>  i tell you he added ina scream of triumph ive got a certified copy of that inscriptionthanks to shadrach on whose dirty head be blessings</s> i congratulated him heartily upon this triumph and before he proceededto give us further archological details asked him for some informationabout my boy</s> oh said higgs he is a very nice young man and extremely goodlooking</s>  indeed i am quite proud to have such a godson</s>  he was muchinterested to hear that you were hunting for him after so many yearsquite touched indeed</s>  he still talks english though with a fung accentand of course would like to escape</s>  meanwhile he is having a verygood time being chief singer to the god for his voice is reallybeautiful an office which carries with it all sorts of privileges</s>  itold you didnt i that he is to be married to barungs only legitimatedaughter on the night of the next full moon but one</s>  the ceremony isto take place in harmac city and will be the greatest of its sort forgenerations a feast of the entire people in short</s>  i should very muchlike to be present at it but being an intelligent young man he haspromised to keep notes of everything which i hope may become availablein due course</s> and is he attached to this savage lady</s>  i asked dismayed</s> attached</s>  oh dear no i think he said he had never seen her and onlyknew that she was rather plain and reported to possess a haughty temper</s> he is a philosophical young man however as might be expected from onewho has undergone so many vicissitudes and therefore takes thingsas they come thanking heaven that they are no worse</s>  you see asthe husband of the sultans daughter unless the pair quarrel veryviolently he will be safe from the lions and he could never quite sayas much before</s>  but we didnt go into these domestic matters very deeplyas there were so many more important things to interest us both</s>  hewanted to know all about you and our plans and naturally i wanted toknow all about the fung and the ritual and traditions connected with theworship of harmac so that we were never dull for a single moment</s> in fact i wish that we could have had longer together for we becameexcellent friends</s>  but whatever happens i think that i have collectedthe cream of his information and he tapped a fat notebook in hishands addingwhat an awful thing it would have been if a lion had eaten this</s>  formyself it did not matter there may be many better egyptologists but idoubt if any one of them will again have such opportunities of originalresearch</s>  however i took every possible precaution to save my notesby leaving a copy of the most important of them written with nativeink upon sheepskin in charge of your son</s>  indeed i meant to leave theoriginals also but fortunately forgot in the excitement of my veryhurried departure</s> i agreed with him that his chances had been unique and that he was amost lucky archologist and presently he went on puffing at his pipe</s> of course when oliver turned up in that unexpected fashion on the backof the idol remembering your wishes and natural desire to recoveryour son i did my best to rescue him also</s>  but he wasnt in the roombeneath where i thought i should find him</s>  the priests were thereinstead and they had heard us talking above and you know the rest</s> well as it happens it didnt matter though that descent into theden of lionsthere were two or three hundred feet of it and the ropeseemed worn uncommonly thin with usewas a trying business to thenerves</s> what did you think about all the time</s>  asked oliver curiously</s> think about</s>  i didnt think much was in too great a fright</s>  i justwondered whether st</s>  paul had the same sensations when he was let downin a basket wondered what the early christian martyrs felt like inthe arena wondered whether barung with whom my parting was quiteaffectionate would come in the morning and look for me as darius didfor daniel and how much he would find if he did hoped that my specswould give one of those brutes appendicitis and so forth</s>  my word</s>  itwas sickening especially that kind of schooltreat swing and bump atthe end</s>  i never could bear swinging</s>  still it was all for the best asi shouldnt have gone a yard along that sphinxs tail without tumblingoff tightrope walking not being in my line and ill tell you whatyou are just the best three fellows in the whole world</s>  dont you thinki forget that because i havent said much</s>  and now lets have your yarnfor i want to hear how things stand which i never expected to do thisside of judgmentday</s> so we told him all while he listened openmouthed</s>  when we came to thedescription of the tomb of the kings his excitement could scarcely berestrained</s> you havent touched them he almost screamed dont say you have beenvandals enough to touch them for every article must be catalogued insitu and drawings must be made</s>  if possible specimen groups with theirsurrounding offerings should be moved so that they can be set up againin museums</s>  why theres six months work before me at least</s>  and tothink that if it hadnt been for you by now i should be in process ofdigestion by a lion a stinking mangy sacred lion</s> next morning i was awakened by higgs limping into my room in some weirdsleepingsuit that he had contrived with the help of quick</s> i say old fellow he said tell me some more about that girl waldanagasta</s>  what a sweet face shes got and what pluck</s>  of course suchthings aint in my line never looked at a woman these twenty yearspast hard enough to remember her next morning but by jingo</s>  the eyesof that one made me feel quite queer here and he hit the sleepingsuitsomewhere in the middle though perhaps it was only because she wassuch a contrast to the lions</s> ptolemy i answered in a solemn voice let me tell you that she ismore dangerous to meddle with than any lion and whats more if youdont want to further complicate matters with a flaming row you hadbetter keep to your old habits and leave her eyes alone</s>  i mean thatoliver is in love with her</s> of course he is</s>  i never expected anything else but whats that got todo with it</s>  why shouldnt i be in love with her too</s>  though i admithe added sadly contemplating his rotund form the chances are in hisfavour especially as hes got the start</s> they are ptolemy for shes in love with him and i told him what wehad seen in the tomb of kings</s> first he roared with laughter then on second thoughts grew exceedinglyindignant</s> i call it scandalous of oliver compromising us all in this waythelucky dog</s>  these selfish amorous adventures will let us in for no endof trouble</s>  it is even probably adams that you and i may come to amiserable end solely because of this young mans erotic tendencies</s> just fancy neglecting business in order to run after a prettyroundfaced jewess that is if she is a jewess which i doubt as theblood must have got considerably mixed by now and the first queen ofsheba if she ever existed was an ethiopian</s>  as a friend almost oldenough to be his father i shall speak to him very seriously</s> all right i called after him as he hobbled off to take his bathonly if you are wise you wont speak to maqueda for she mightmisinterpret your motives if you go on staring at her as you didyesterday</s> that morning i was summoned to see the prince joshua and dress hiswounds which although not of a serious nature were very painful</s>  themoment that i entered the mans presence i noticed a change in his face</s> like the rest of us i had always set this fellow down as a mere poltroonand windbag a blower of his own trumpet as oliver had called him</s>  nowi got an insight into his real nature which showed me that althoughhe might be these things and worse he was also a very determined anddangerous person animated by ambitions which he meant to satisfy at allhazards</s> when i had done what i could for him and told him that in my opinion hehad no ill results to fear from his hurts since the thick clothes hewas wearing at the time had probably cleaned the lions paws of anypoison that might have been on them he saidphysician i desire private words with you</s> i bowed and he went onthe child of kings hereditary ruler of this land somewhat against theadvice of her council has thought fit to employ you and your gentilecompanions in order that by your skill and certain arts of which you aremasters you may damage its ancient enemies the fung and in reward haspromised to pay you well should you succeed in your endeavours</s>  now iwish you to understand that though you think yourselves great men andmay for aught i know be great in your own country here you are butservants like any other mercenaries whom it may please us to hire</s> his tone was so offensive that though it might have been wiser to keepsilent i could not help interrupting him</s> you use hard words prince i said let me then explain what is thereal pay for which we work and undergo some risks</s>  mine is the hope ofrecovering a son who is the slave of your enemies</s>  that of the captainorme is the quest of adventure and war since being a rich man in hisown country he needs no further wealth</s>  that of him whom you call blackwindows but whose name is higgs is the pure love of learning</s>  inengland and throughout the west he is noted for his knowledge of deadpeoples their languages and customs and it is to study these that hehas undertaken so terrible a journey</s>  as for quick he is ormes manwho has known him from childhood an old soldier who has served with himin war and comes hither to be with the master whom he loves</s> ah</s>  said joshua a servant a person of no degree who yet dares tothreaten me the premier prince of the abati to my face</s> in the presence of death all men are equal prince</s>  you acted in afashion that might have brought his lord who was daring a desperatedeed to a hideous doom</s> and what do i care about his lords desperate deeds physician</s>  i seethat you set store by such things and think those who accomplish themgreat and wonderful</s>  well we do not</s>  there is no savage among thebarbarous fung would not do all that your orme does and more justbecause he is a savage</s>  we who are civilized we who are cultivatedwe who are wise know better</s>  our lives were given us to enjoy not tothrow away or to lose at the swords point and therefore no doubtyou would call us cowards</s> yet prince those who bear that title of coward which you hold one ofhonour are apt to perish at the swords point</s>  the fung wait withoutyour gates o prince</s> and therefore o gentile we hire you to fight the fung</s>  still ibear no grudge against your servant quick who is himself but awhiteskinned fung for he acted according to his nature and i forgivehim only in the future let him beware</s>  and nowfor a greater matter</s> the child of kings is beautiful she is young and high spirited a newface from another land may perchance touch her fancy</s>  but he addedmeaningly let the owner of that face remember who she is and whathe is let him remember that for any outside the circle of the ancientblood to lift his eyes to the daughter of solomon is to earn deathdeath slow and cruel for himself and all who aid and abet him</s>  let himremember lastly that this highborn lady to whom he an unknown andvagrant gentile dares to talk as equal to equal has from childhoodbeen my affianced who will shortly be my wife although it may pleaseher to seem to flout me after the fashion of maidens and that we abatiare jealous of the honour of our women</s>  do you understand</s> yes prince i answered for by now my temper was roused</s>  but i wouldhave you understand something alsothat we are men of a high race whosearm stretches over half the world and that we differ from the littletribe of the abati whose fame is not known to us in thisthat we arejealous of our own honour and do not need to hire strangers to fightthe foes we fear to face</s>  next time i come to attend to your woundso prince i trust that they will be in front and not behind</s>  one wordmore if you will be advised by me you will not threaten that captainwhom you call a gentile and a mercenary lest you should learn that itis not always well to be a coward of blood however ancient</s> then in a towering rage i left him feeling that i had made a thoroughfool of myself</s>  but the truth was that i could not sit still and hearmen such as my companions to say nothing of myself spoken of thus bya bloated cur who called himself a prince and boasted of his ownpoltroonery</s>  he glowered at me as i went and the men of his party whohung about the end of the great room and in his courts glowered atme also</s>  clearly he was a very dangerous cur and i almost wished thatinstead of threatening to slap his face down in the tunnel quick hadbroken his neck and made an end of him</s> so did the others when i told them the story although i think it openedtheir eyes and especially those of oliver to the grave and growingdangers of the situation</s>  afterward he informed me that he had spoken ofthe matter with maqueda and that she was much frightened for our sakesand somewhat for her own</s>  joshua she said was a man capable of anycrime who had at his back the great majority of the abati a jealousmean and intolerant race who made up in cunning for what they lacked incourage</s> yet as i saw well the peril of their situation did nothing to separatethis pair or to lessen their love</s>  indeed rather did it seem to bindthem closer together and to make them more completely one</s>  in shortthe tragedy took its appointed course whilst we stood by and watched ithelplessly</s> on the afternoon of my angry interview with joshua we were summoned toa meeting of the council whither we went not without some trepidationexpecting trouble</s>  trouble there was but of a different sort to thatwhich we feared</s>  scarcely had we entered the great room where the childof kings was seated in her chair of state surrounded by all the pomp andceremony of her mimic court when the big doors at the end of it wereopened and through them marched three graybearded men in white robeswhom we saw at once were heralds or ambassadors from the fung</s>  thesemen bowed to the veiled maqueda and turning toward where we stood in alittle group apart bowed to us also</s> but of joshua who was there supported by two servants for he could notyet stand alone and the other notables and priests of the abati theytook not the slightest heed</s> speak said maqueda</s> lady answered the spokesman of the embassy we are sent by oursultan barung son of barung ruler of the fung nation</s>  these are thewords of barung o walda nagasta</s>  by the hands and the wit of the whitelords whom you have called to your aid you have of late done much evilto the god harmac and to me his servant</s>  you have destroyed one of thegates of my city and with it many of my people</s>  you have rescued aprisoner out of my hands robbing harmac of his sacrifice and therebybringing his wrath upon us</s>  you have slain sundry of the sacred beaststhat are the mouth of sacrifice you have killed certain of the priestsand guards of harmac in a hole of the rocks</s>  moreover my spies tell methat you plan further ills against the god and against me</s>  now i sendto tell you that for these and other offences i will make an end of thepeople of the abati whom hitherto i have spared</s>  in a little while imarry my daughter to the white man that priest of harmac who is calledsinger of egypt and who is said to be the son of the physician inyour service but after i have celebrated this feast and my people havefinished the hoeing of their crops i take up the sword in earnest norwill i lay it down again until the abati are no more</s> learn that last night after the holy beasts had been slain andthe sacrifice snatched away the god harmac spoke to his priests inprophecy</s>  and this was his prophecy that before the gathering in of theharvest his head should sleep above the plain of mur</s>  we know not theinterpretation of the saying but this i know that before the gatheringof the harvest i or those who rule after me will lie down to sleepwithin my city of mur</s> now choosesurrender forthwith and save for the dog joshua whothe other day tried to entrap me against the custom of peoples and tenothers whom i shall name i will spare the lives of all of you thoughjoshua and these ten i will hang since they are not worthy to die bythe sword</s>  or resist and by harmac himself i swear that every man amongthe abati shall die save the white lords whom i honour because they arebrave and that servant of yours who stood with them last night in theden of lions and that every woman shall be made a slave save you owalda nagasta because of your great heart</s>  your answer o lady of theabati</s> now maqueda looked around the faces of her council and saw fear writtenupon them all</s>  indeed as we noted many of them shook in their terror</s> my answer will be short ambassadors of barung she replied still iam but one woman and it is fitting that those who represent the peopleshould speak for the people</s>  my uncle joshua you are the first of mycouncil what have you to say</s>  are you willing to give up your life withten others whose names i do not know that there may be peace between usand the fung</s> what</s>  answered joshua with a splutter of rage do i live to hear awalda nagasta suggest that the first prince of the land her uncle andaffianced husband should be surrendered to our hereditary foes to behanged like a wornout hound and do you o unknown ten who doubtlessstand in this chamber live to hear it also</s> my uncle you do not</s>  i asked if such was your wish that is all</s> then i answer that it is not my wish nor the wish of the ten nor thewish of the abati</s>  nay we will fight the fung and destroy them andof their beastheaded idol harmac we will make blocks to build oursynagogues and stones to pave our roads</s>  do you hear savages of fung</s> and assisted by his two servants he hobbled towards them grinning intheir faces</s> the envoys looked him up and down with their quiet eyes</s>  we hear and weare very glad to hear their spokesman answered since we fung loveto settle our quarrels with the sword and not by treaty</s>  but to youjoshua we say make haste to die before we enter mur since the rope isnot the only means of death whereof we know</s> very solemnly the three ambassadors saluted first the child of kingsand next ourselves then turned to go</s> kill them</s>  shouted joshua they have threatened and insulted me theprince</s> but no one lifted a hand against the men who passed safely out of thepalace to the square where an escort waited with their horses</s> chapter xivhow pharaoh met shadrachwhen the ambassadors had gone at first there was silence a very heavysilence since even the frivolous abati felt that the hour was big withfate</s>  of a sudden however the members of the council began to chatterlike so many monkeys each talking without listening to what hisneighbour said till at length a gorgeously dressed person i understoodthat he was a priest stepped forward and shouted down the others</s> then he spoke in an excited and venomous fashion</s>  he pointed out that wegentiles had brought all this trouble upon mur since before we came theabati although threatened had lived in peace and gloryhe actuallyused the word glory</s> for generations</s>  but now we had stung the fung asa hornet stings a bull and made them mad so that they wished to tossthe abati</s>  he proposed therefore that we should at once be ejectedfrom mur</s> at this point i saw joshua whisper into the ear of a man who calledoutno no for then they would go to their friend barung a savage likethemselves and having learned our secrets would doubtless use themagainst us</s>  i say that they must be killed instantly and he drew asword and waved it</s> quick walked up to the fellow and clapped a pistol to his head</s> drop that sword he said or youll never hear the end of thestory and he obeyed whereupon quick came back</s> now maqueda began to speak quietly enough although i could see thatshe was quaking with passion</s> these men are our guests she said come hither to serve us</s>  do youdesire to murder our guests</s>  moreover of what use would that be</s>  onething alone can save us the destruction of the god of the fungsince according to the ancient saying of that people when the idol isdestroyed the fung will leave their city of harmac</s>  moreover as to thisnew prophecy of the priests of the idol that before the gathering inof the harvest his head shall sleep above the plain of mur how canthat happen if it is destroyed unless indeed it means that harmac shallsleep in the heavens</s>  therefore what have you to fear from threats builtupon that which cannot happen</s> but can you destroy this false god harmac or dare you fight thefung</s>  you know that it is not so for had it been so what need was therefor me to send for these westerns</s>  and if you murder them will barungthereby be appeased</s>  nay i tell you that being a brave and honourableman although our enemy he will become ten times more wroth with youthan he was before and exact a vengeance even more terrible</s>  i tell youalso that then you must find another walda nagasta to rule over yousince i maqueda will do so no more</s> that is impossible said some one you are the last woman of the trueblood</s> then you can choose one of blood that is not true or elect a kingas the jews elected saul for if my guests are butchered i shall die ofvery shame</s> these words of hers seemed to cow the council one of whom asked whatwould she have them do</s> do</s>  she replied throwing back her veil why be men raise an armyof every male who can carry a sword help the foreigners and they willlead you to victory</s>  people of the abati would you be slaughteredwould you see your women slaves and your ancient name blotted out fromthe list of peoples</s> now some of them cried no</s> then save yourselves</s>  you are still many the strangers here have skillin war they can lead if you will follow</s>
 be brave a while and i swearto you that by harvest the abati shall sit in the city of harmac and notthe fung in mur</s>  i have spoken now do what you will and rising fromher chair of state maqueda left the chamber motioning to us to dolikewise</s> the end of all this business was that a peace was made between us andthe council of the abati</s>  after their pompous pedantic fashion theyswore solemnly on the roll of the law that they would aid us in everyway to overcome the fung and even obey such military orders as wemight give them subject to the confirmation of these orders by a smallcouncil of their generals</s>  in short being very frightened for a timethey forgot their hatred of us foreigners</s> so a scheme of operations was agreed upon and some law passed by thecouncil the only governing body among the abati for they possessed norepresentative institutions under which law a kind of conscription wasestablished for a while</s>  let me say at once that it met with the mostintense opposition</s>  the abati were agriculturalists who loathed militaryservice</s>  from their childhood they had heard of the imminence ofinvasion but no actual invasion had ever yet taken place</s>  the fung werealways without and they were always within an inland isle the wall ofrock that they thought impassable being their sea which protected themfrom danger</s> they had no experience of slaughter and rapine their imaginations werenot sufficiently strong to enable them to understand what these thingsmeant they were lost in the pettiness of daily life and its pressinglocal interests</s>  their homes in flames they themselves massacred theirwomen and children dragged off to be the slaves of the victors a poorremnant left to die of starvation among the wasted fields or to becomewild men of the rocks</s>  all these things they looked upon as a mere talea romance such as their local poets repeated in the evenings of awet season dim and faroff events which might have happened to thecanaanites and jebusites and amalekites in the ancient days whereof thebook of their law told them but which could never happen to them thecomfortable abati</s>  in that book the israelites always conquered in theend although the philistines alias fung sat at their gates</s>  for itwill be remembered that it includes no account of the final fall ofjerusalem and awful destruction of its citizens of which they hadlittle if any knowledge</s> so it came about that our recruiting parties perhaps press gangs wouldbe a better term were not well received</s>  i know it for this branch ofthe business was handed over to me of course as adviser to the abaticaptains and on several occasions when riding round the villages onthe shores of their beautiful lake we were met by showers of stonesand were even the object of active attacks which had to be put down withbloodshed</s>  still an army of five or six thousand men was got togethersomehow and formed into camps whence desertions were incessant onceor twice accompanied by the murder of officers</s> its opeless downright opeless doctor said quick to me droppinghis hs as he sometimes did in the excitement of the moment</s>  what canone do with a crowd of pigs everyone of them bent on bolting to his ownsty or anywhere except toward the enemy</s>  the sooner the fung get themthe better for all concerned say i and if it wasnt for our ladyyonder quick always called maqueda after our lady after it had beenimpressed upon him that her majesty was an incorrect title my adviceto the captain and you gentlemen would be get out of this infernal holeas quick as your legs can carry you and lets do a bit of hunting onthe way home leaving the abati to settle their own affairs</s> you forget sergeant that i have a reason for staying in this part ofthe world and so perhaps have the others</s>  for instance the professoris very fond of those old skeletons down in the cave and i paused</s> yes doctor and the captain is very fond of something much better thana skeleton and so are we all</s>  well weve got to see it through butsomehow i dont think that every one of us will have that luck thoughits true that when a man has lived fairly straight according to hislights a few years more or less dont matter much one way or the other</s> after all except you gentlemen who is there that will miss samuelquick</s> then without waiting for an answer drawing himself up straight as aramrod he marched off to assist some popinjays of abati officers whomhe hated and who hated him to instil the elements of drill into a newlyraised company leaving me to wonder what fears or premonitions filledhis honest soul</s> but this was not quicks principal work since for at least six hoursof every day he was engaged in helping oliver in our great enterprise ofdriving a tunnel from the end of the tomb of kings deep into the solidrock that formed the base of the mighty idol of the fung</s>  the taskwas stupendous and would indeed have been impossible had not ormesconjecture that some passage had once run from the extremity of the cavetoward the idol proved to be perfectly accurate</s>  such a passage indeedwas found walled up at the back of the chair containing the bones of thehunchbacked king</s>  it descended very sharply for a distance of severalhundred yards after which for another hundred yards or more its wallsand roof were so riven and shaky that for fear of accidents we foundit necessary to timber them as we went</s> at last we came to a place where they had fallen in altogether shakendown i presume by the great earthquake which had destroyed so muchof the ancient cavecity</s>  at this spot if olivers instruments andcalculations could be trusted we were within about two hundred feetof the floor of the den of lions to which it seemed probable that thepassage once led and of course the question arose as to what should bedone</s> a council was held to discuss this problem at which maqueda and a fewof the abati notables were present</s>  to these oliver explained that evenif that were possible it would be useless to clear out the old passageand at the end find ourselves once more in the den of lions</s> what then is your plan</s>  asked maqueda</s> lady he answered i your servant am instructed to attempt todestroy the idol harmac by means of the explosives which we havebrought with us from england</s>  first i would ask you if you still clingto that design</s> why should it be abandoned</s>  inquired maqueda</s>  what have you againstit</s> two things lady</s>  as an act of war the deed seems useless sincesupposing that the sphinx is shattered and a certain number of priestsand guards are destroyed how will that advance your cause</s>  secondlysuch destruction will be very difficult if it can be done at all</s>  thestuff we have with us it is true is of fearful strength yet who canbe sure that there is enough of it to move this mountain of hard rockof which i cannot calculate the weight not having the measurements orany knowledge of the size of the cavities within its bulk</s>  lastly ifthe attempt is to be made a tunnel must be hollowed of not less thanthree hundred feet in length first downward and then upward into thevery base of the idol and if this is to be done within six weeks thatis by the night of the marriage of the daughter of barung the workwill be very hard if indeed it can be completed at all althoughhundreds of men labour day and night</s> now maqueda thought a while then looked up and saidfriend you are brave and skilful tell us all your mind</s>  if you sat inmy place what would you do</s> lady i would lead out every ablebodied man and attack the city of thefung say on the night of the great festival when they are off theirguard</s>  i would blow in the gates of the city of harmac and storm it anddrive away the fung and afterwards take possession of the idol and ifit is thought necessary destroy it piecemeal from within</s> now maqueda consulted with her councillors who appeared to be muchdisturbed at this suggestion and finally called us back and gave us herdecision</s> these lords of the council she said speaking with a ring of contemptin her voice declare that your plan is mad and that they will neversanction it because the abati could not be persuaded to undertake sodangerous an enterprise as an attack upon the city of harmac whichwould end they think in all of them being killed</s>  they point out oorme that the prophecy is that the fung will leave the plain of harmacwhen their god is destroyed and not before and that therefore it mustbe destroyed</s>  they say further o orme that for a year you and yourcompanions are the sworn servants of the abati and that it is yourbusiness to receive orders not to give them also that the conditionupon which you earn your pay is that you destroy the idol of the fung</s> this is the decision of the council spoken by the mouth of the princejoshua who command further that you shall at once set about thebusiness to execute which you and your companions are present here inmur</s> is that your command also o child of kings</s>  answered olivercolouring</s> since i also think that the abati can never be forced to attack thecity of the fung it is o orme though the words in which it is couchedare not my words</s> very well o child of kings i will do my best</s>  only blame us not ifthe end of this matter is other than these advisers of yours expect</s> prophecies are twoedged swords to play with and i do not believe thata race of fighting men like the fung will fly and leave you triumphantjust because a stone image is shattered if that can be done in the timeand with the means which we possess</s>  meanwhile i ask that you shouldgive me two hundred and fifty picked men of the mountaineers not ofthe townspeople under the captaincy of japhet who must choose them toassist us in our work</s> it shall be done she answered and we made our bows and went</s>  as wepassed through the council we heard joshua say in a loud voice meant forus to hearthanks be to god these hired gentiles have been taught their place atlast</s> oliver turned on him so fiercely that he recoiled thinking that he wasabout to strike him</s> be careful prince joshua he said that before this business isfinished you are not taught yours which i think may be lowly and helooked meaningly at the ground</s> so the labour began and it was heavy indeed as well as dangerous</s> fortunately in addition to the picrate compounds that quick calledazure stinging bees we had brought with us a few cases of dynamiteof which we now made use for blasting purposes</s>  a hole was drilled inthe face of the tunnel and the charge inserted</s>  then all retreated backinto the tomb of kings till the cartridge had exploded and the smokecleared off which took a long while when our people advanced with ironbars and baskets and cleared away the dbris after which the processmust be repeated</s> oh</s>  the heat of that narrow hole deep in the bowels of the rock andthe reek of the stagnant air which sometimes was so bad that the lightswould scarcely burn</s>  indeed after a hundred feet had been completedwe thought that it would be impossible to proceed since two men diedof asphyxiation and the others although they were good fellows enoughrefused to return into the tunnel</s>  at length however orme and japhetpersuaded some of the best of them to do so and shortly after this theatmosphere improved very much i suppose because we cut some cranny orshaft which communicated with the open air</s> there were other dangers also notably of the collapse of the wholeroof where the rock was rotten as we found it to be in places</s>  thenit proved very hard to deal with the water for once or twice westruck small springs impregnated with copper or some other mineral thatblistered the feet and skin since every drop of this acid water had tobe carried out in wooden pails</s>  that difficulty we overcame at last bysinking a narrow well down to the level of the ancient tunnel of which ihave spoken as having been shaken in by the earthquake</s> thus we or rather oliver and quick with the mountaineers toiled on</s> higgs did his best but after a while proved quite unable to bear theheat which became too much for so stout a man</s>  the end of it was thathe devoted himself to the superintendence of the removal of the rubbishinto the tomb of kings the care of the stores and so forth</s>  at leastthat was supposed to be his business but really he employed most of histime in drawing and cataloguing the objects of antiquity and the groupsof bones that were buried there and in exploring the remains of theunderground city</s>  in truth this task of destruction was most repellentto the poor professor</s> to think he said to us to think that i who all my life havepreached the iniquity of not conserving every relic of the past shouldnow be employed in attempting to obliterate the most wonderful objectever fashioned by the ancients</s>  it is enough to make a vandal weep andi pray heaven that you may not succeed in your infamous design</s>  whatdoes it matter if the abati are wiped out as lots of better people havebeen before them</s>  what does it matter if we accompany them to oblivionso long as that noble sphinx is preserved to be the wonder of futuregenerations</s>  well thank goodness at any rate i have seen it which ismore probably than any of you will ever do</s>  there another brute isdumping his rubbish over the skull of no</s>  14</s> thus we laboured continually each at his different task for the workin the mine never stopped oliver being in charge during the day andquick at night for a whole week since on each sunday they changed withtheir gangs quick taking the day shift and oliver the night or viceversa</s>  sometimes maqueda came down the cave to inspect progressalways i noticed at those hours when oliver happened to be off duty</s> then on this pretext or on that they would wander away together to visiti know not what in the recesses of the underground city or elsewhere</s> in vain did i warn them that their every step was dogged and thattheir every word and action were noted by spies who crept after themcontinually since twice i caught one of these gentry in the act</s>  theywere infatuated and would not listen</s> at this time oliver only left the underground city twice or thrice aweek to breathe the fresh air for an hour or two</s>  in truth he had noleisure</s>  for this same reason he fitted himself up a bed in what hadbeen a priests chamber or a sanctuary in the old temple and sleptthere generally with no other guard but the great dog pharaoh hisconstant companion even in the recesses of the mine</s> it was curious to see how this faithful beast accustomed itself to thedarkness and made its other senses especially that of smell servethe purpose of eyes as do the blind</s>  by degrees too it learned allthe details of the operations thus when the cartridge was in place forfiring it would rise and begin to walk out of the tunnel even beforethe men in charge</s> one night the tragedy that i feared very nearly happened and indeedmust have happened had it not been for this same hound pharaoh</s>  aboutsix oclock in the evening oliver came off duty after an eighthourshift in the tunnel leaving higgs in command for a little while untilit was time for quick to take charge</s>  i had been at work outside all dayin connection with the new conscript army a regiment of which wasin revolt because the men most of whom were what we should callsmallholders declared that they wanted to go home to weed their crops</s> indeed it had proved necessary for the child of kings herself to besummoned to plead with them and condemn some of the ringleaders topunishment</s> when at length this business was over we left together and the poorlady exasperated almost to madness sharply refusing the escort of anyof her people requested me to accompany her to the mine</s> at the mouth of the tunnel she met oliver as probably she had arrangedto do and after he had reported progress to her wandered away with himas usual each of them carrying a lamp into some recess of the buriedcity</s>  i followed them at a distance not from curiosity or because iwished to see more of the wonders of that city whereof i was heartilysick but because i suspected that they were being spied upon</s> the pair vanished round a corner that i knew ended in a culdesac soextinguishing my lamp i sat down on a fallen column and waited till ishould see their light reappear when i proposed to effect my retreat</s> whilst i sat thus thinking on many things and to tell the truth verydepressed in mind i heard a sound as of some one moving and instantlystruck a match</s>  the light of it fell full upon the face of a man whomi recognized at once as a bodyservant of the prince joshua thoughwhether he was passing me toward the pair or returning from theirdirection i could not be sure</s> what are you doing here</s>  i asked</s> what is that to you physician</s>  he answered</s> then the match burnt out and before i could light another he hadvanished like a snake into a stone wall</s> my first impulse was to warn maqueda and oliver that they were beingwatched but reflecting that the business was awkward and that the spywould doubtless have given over his task for this day i left it aloneand went down to the tomb of the kings to help higgs</s>  just afterwardsquick came on duty long before his time the fact being that he had noconfidence in the professor as a director of mining operations</s>  when heappeared higgs and i retreated from that close and filthy tunneland by way of recreation put in an hour or so at the cataloguing andarchological research in which his soul delighted</s> if only we could get all this lot out of mur he said with a sweep ofhis hand we should be the most famous men in europe for at least threedays and rich into the bargain</s> ptolemy i answered we shall be fortunate if we get ourselves aliveout of mur let alone these bones and ancient treasures and i told himwhat i had seen that evening</s> his fat and kindly face grew anxious</s> ah</s>  he said</s>  well i dont blame him should probably do the samemyself if i got the chance and so would youif you were twenty yearsyounger</s>  no i dont blame him or her either for the fact is thatalthough their race education and circumstances are so different theyare one of natures pairs and while they are alive nothing will keepthem apart</s>  you might as well expect a magnet and a bit of iron toremain separate on a sheet of notepaper</s>  moreover they give themselvesaway as people in that state always do</s>  the pursuit of archology hasits dangers but it is a jolly sight safer than that of woman though itdid land me in a den of lions</s>  whats going to happen old fellow</s> cant say but i think it very probable that oliver will be murderedand that we shall follow the same road or if we are lucky be onlybundled out of mur</s>  well its time for dinner if i get a chance i willgive them a hint</s> so we made our way to the old temple in the great cave where we keptour stores and oliver had his headquarters</s>  here we found him waitingfor us and our meal ready for food was always brought to us by thepalace servants</s>  when we had eaten and these men had cleared away welit our pipes and fed the dog pharaoh upon the scraps that had beenreserved for him</s>  then i told oliver about the spy whom i had caughttracking him and maqueda</s> well what of it</s>  he said colouring in his telltale fashion sheonly took me to see what she believed to be an ancient inscription on acolumn in that northern aisle</s> then shed have done better to take me my boy said higgs</s>  what wasthe character like</s> dont know he answered guiltily</s>  she could not find it again</s> an awkward silence followed which i broke</s> oliver i said i dont think you ought to go on sleeping here alone</s> you have too many enemies in this place</s> rubbish he answered though its true pharaoh seemed uneasy lastnight and that once i woke up and thought i heard footsteps in thecourt outside</s>  i set them down to ghosts in which i have almost come tobelieve in this haunted place and went to sleep again</s> ghosts be blowed</s>  said higgs vulgarly if there were such things ihave slept with too many mummies not to see them</s>  that confounded joshuais the wizard who raises your ghosts</s>  look here old boy he addedlet me camp with you tonight since quick must be in the tunnel andadams has to sleep outside in case he is wanted on the army business</s> not a bit of it he answered you know you are too asthmatical to geta wink in this atmosphere</s>  i wont hear of such a thing</s> then come and sleep with us in the guesthouse</s> cant be done the sergeant has got a very nasty job down there aboutone oclock and i promised to be handy in case he calls me up and hepointed to the portable field telephone that fortunately we had broughtwith us from england which was fixed closed by adding if only thatsilly thing had another few hundred yards of wire id come but yousee it hasnt and i must be in touch with the work</s> at this moment the bell tinkled and orme made a jump for the receiverthrough which for the next five minutes he was engaged in giving rapidand to us quite unintelligible directions</s> there you are he said when he had replaced the mouthpiece on itshook if i hadnt been here they would probably have had the roofof the tunnel down and killed some people</s>  no no i cant leave thatreceiver unless i go back to the mine which i am too tired to do</s> however dont you fret</s>  with a pistol a telephone and pharaoh imsafe enough</s>  and now good night you fellows had better be getting homeas i must be up early tomorrow and want to sleep while i can</s> on the following morning about five oclock higgs and i were awakened bysome one knocking at our door</s>  i rose and opened it whereon in walkedquick a grim and grimy figure for as his soaked clothes and soiledface told us he had but just left his work in the mine</s> captain wants to see you as soon as possible gentlemen he said</s> whats the matter sergeant</s>  asked higgs as we got into our garments</s> youll see for yourself presently professor was the laconic replynor could we get anything more out of him</s> five minutes later we were advancing at a run through the dense darknessof the underground city each of us carrying a lamp</s>  i reached the ruinsof the old temple first for quick seemed very tired and lagged behindand in that atmosphere higgs was scant of breath and could not travelfast</s>  at the doorway of the place where he slept stood the tall formof oliver holding a lamp aloft</s>  evidently he was waiting for us</s>  by hisside sat the big yellow dog pharaoh that when he smelt us gambolledforward wagging his tail in greeting</s> come here said orme in a low and solemn voice i have something toshow you and he led the way into the priests chamber or sanctuarywhatever it may have been where he slept upon a rough nativemadebedstead</s>  at the doorway he halted lowered the lamp he held andpointed to something dark on the floor to the right of his bedsteadsaying look</s> there lay a dead man and by his side a great knife that evidently hadfallen from his hand</s>  at the first glance we recognised the face whichby the way was singularly peaceful as though it were that of oneplunged in deep sleep</s>  this seemed odd since the throat below wasliterally torn out</s> shadrach</s>  we said with one voice</s> shadrach it was shadrach our former guide who had betrayed usshadrach who to save his own life had shown us how to rescue higgsand for that service been pardoned as i think i mentioned</s>  shadrach andno other</s> pussy seems to have been on the prowl and to have met a dog remarkedquick</s> do you understand what has happened</s>  asked oliver in a dry hardvoice</s>  perhaps i had better explain before anything is moved</s>  shadrachmust have crept in here last nighti dont know at what time for islept through it allfor purposes of his own</s>  but he forgot his oldenemy pharaoh and pharaoh killed him</s>  see his throat</s>  when pharaohbites he doesnt growl and of course shadrach could say nothing oras he had dropped his knife for the matter of that do anything either</s> when i was woke up about an hour ago by the telephone bell the dog wasfast asleep for he is accustomed to that bell with his head restingupon the body of shadrach</s>  now why did shadrach come into my room atnight with a drawn knife in his hand</s> doesnt seem a difficult question to answer replied higgs in thehigh voice which was common to him when excited</s>  he came here to murderyou and pharaoh was too quick for him thats all</s>  that dog was thecheapest purchase you ever made friend oliver</s> yes answered orme he came here to murder meyou were right aboutthe risk after allbut what i wonder is who sent him</s> and so you may go on wondering for the rest of your life captainexclaimed quick</s>  still i think we might guess if we tried</s> then news of what had happened was sent to the palace and within littleover an hour maqueda arrived accompanied by joshua and several othermembers of her council</s>  when she saw and understood everything she washorrified and sternly asked joshua what he knew of this business</s>  ofcourse he proved to be completely innocent and had not the slightestidea of who had set the murderer on to work this deed of darkness</s> nor had anybody else the general suggestion being that shadrach hadattempted it out of revenge and met with the due reward of his crime</s> only that day poor pharaoh was poisoned</s>  well he had done his work andhis memory is blessed</s> chapter xvsergeant quick has a presentimentfrom this time forward all of us and especially oliver were guardednight and day by picked men who it was believed could not be corrupted</s> as a consequence the tsar of russia scarcely leads a life more irksomethan ours became at mur</s>  of privacy there was none left to us sincesentries and detectives lurked at every corner while tasters wereobliged to eat of each dish and drink from each cup before it touchedour lips lest our fate should be that of pharaoh whose loss we mournedas much as though the poor dog had been some beloved human being</s> most of all was it irksome i think to oliver and maqueda whoseopportunities of meeting were much curtailed by the exigencies of thisrigid espionage</s>  who can murmur sweet nothings to his adored when twosoldiers armed to the teeth have been instructed never to let him outof their sight</s>  particularly is this so if the adored happens to be theruler of those soldiers to whom the person guarded has no right tobe making himself agreeable</s>  for when off duty even the most faithfulguardians are apt to talk</s>  of course the result was that the pair tookrisks which did not escape observation</s>  indeed their intimate relationsbecame a matter of gossip throughout the land</s> still annoying as they might be these precautions succeeded for noneof us were poisoned or got our throats cut although we were constantlythe victims of mysterious accidents</s>  thus a heavy rock rolled down uponus when we sat together one evening upon the hillside and a flightof arrows passed between us while we were riding along the edge ofa thicket by one of which higgss horse was killed</s>  only when themountain and the thicket were searched no one could be found</s>  moreovera great plot against us was discovered in which some of the lordsand priests were implicated but such was the state of feeling in thecountry that beyond warning them privately that their machinations wereknown maqueda did not dare to take proceedings against these men</s> a little later on things mended so far as we were concerned for thefollowing reason one day two shepherds arrived at the palace with someof their companions saying that they had news to communicate</s>  on beingquestioned these peasants averred that while they were herding theirgoats upon the western cliffs many miles away suddenly on the top ofthe hills appeared a body of fifteen fung who bound and blindfoldedthem telling them in mocking language to take a message to the counciland to the white men</s> this was the message that they had better make haste to destroy thegod harmac since otherwise his head would move to mur according to theprophecy and that when it did so the fung would follow as they knewhow to do</s>  then they set the two men on a rock where they could beseen and on the following morning were in fact found by some of theirfellows those who accompanied them to the court and corroborated thisstory</s> of course the matter was duly investigated but as i know for i wentwith the search party when we got to the place no trace of the fungcould be found except one of their spears of which the handle had beendriven into the earth and the blade pointed toward mur evidentlyin threat or defiance</s>  no other token of them remained for as ithappened a heavy rain had fallen and obliterated their footprintswhich in any case must have been faint on this rocky ground</s> notwithstanding the most diligent search by skilled men their mode ofapproach and retreat remained a mystery as indeed it does to thisday</s>  the only places where it was supposed to be possible to scalethe precipice of mur were watched continually so that they could haveclimbed up by none of these</s>  the inference was therefore that the funghad discovered some unknown path and if fifteen men could climb thatpath why not fifteen thousand</s> only where was this path</s>  in vain were great rewards in land andhonours offered to him who should discover it for although suchdiscoveries were continually reported on investigation these werefound to be inventions or mares nests</s>  nothing but a bird could havetravelled by such roads</s> then at last we saw the abati thoroughly frightened for withadditions the story soon passed from mouth to mouth till the wholepeople talked of nothing else</s>  it was as though we english learned thata huge foreign army had suddenly landed on our shores and having cutthe wires and seized the railways was marching upon london</s>  the effectof such tidings upon a nation that always believed invasion to beimpossible may easily be imagined only i hope that we should take thembetter than did the abati</s> their swagger their selfconfidence their talk about the rocky wallsof mur evaporated in an hour</s>  now it was only of the disciplined andterrible regiments of the fung among whom every man was trained to warand of what would happen to them the civilized and domesticated abatia peaceloving people who rightly enough as they declared had refusedall martial burdens should these regiments suddenly appear in theirmidst</s>  they cried out that they were betrayedthey clamoured for theblood of certain of the councillors</s>  that carpet knight joshua lostpopularity for a while while maqueda who was known always to have beenin favour of conscription and perfect readiness to repel attack gainedwhat he had lost</s> leaving their farms they crowded together into the towns and villageswhere they made what in south africa are called laagers</s>  religion whichpractically had been dead among them for they retained but few tracesof the jewish faith if indeed they had ever really practised itbecame the craze of the hour</s>  priests were at a premium sheep andcattle were sacrificed it was even said that after the fashion oftheir foes the fung some human beings shared the same fate</s>  at anyrate the almighty was importuned hourly to destroy the hated fung andto protect his peoplethe abatifrom the results of their own baseselfishness and cowardly neglect</s> well the world has seen such exhibitions before today and willdoubtless see more of them in the instance of greater peoples who allowluxury and pleasureseeking to sap their strength and manhood</s> the upshot of it all was that the abati became obsessed with thesaying of the fung scouts to the shepherds which after all was buta repetition of that of their envoys delivered to the council a littlewhile before that they should hasten to destroy the idol harmac lesthe should move himself to mur</s>  how an idol of such proportions or evenits head could move at all they did not stop to inquire</s>  it was obviousto them however that if he was destroyed there would be nothing tomove and further that we gentiles were the only persons who couldpossibly effect such destruction</s>  so we also became popular for a littlewhile</s>  everybody was pleasant and flattered useverybody even joshuabowed when we approached and took a most lively interest in theprogress of our work which many deputations and prominent individualsurged us to expedite</s> better still the untoward accidents such as those i have mentionedceased</s>  our dogs for we had obtained some others were no longerpoisoned rocks that appeared fixed did not fall no arrows whistledamong us when we went out riding</s>  we even found it safe occasionally todispense with our guards since it was every ones interest to keep usalivefor the present</s>  still i for one was not deceived for a singlemoment and in season and out of season warned the others that the windwould soon blow again from a less favourable quarter</s> we worked we worked we worked</s>  heaven alone knows how we did work</s> think of the task which after all was only one of several</s>  a tunnelmust be bored for i forget how far through virgin rock with thehelp of inadequate tools and unskilled labour and this tunnel must befinished by a certain date</s>  a hundred unexpected difficulties arose andone by one were conquered</s>  great dangers must be run and were avoidedwhile the responsibility of this tremendous engineering feat lay uponthe shoulders of a single individual oliver orme who although he hadbeen educated as an engineer had no great practical experience of suchenterprises</s> truly the occasion makes the man for orme rose to it in a way thati can only call heroic</s>  when he was not actually in the tunnel he waslabouring at his calculations of which many must be made or takinglevels with such instruments as he had</s>  for if there proved to be theslightest error all this toil would be in vain and result only in theblowing of a useless hole through a mass of rock</s>  then there was agreat question as to the effect which would be produced by the amount ofexplosive at his disposal since terrible as might be the force of thestuff unless it were scientifically placed and distributed it wouldassuredly fail to accomplish the desired end</s> at last after superhuman efforts the mine was finished</s>  our stock ofconcentrated explosive about four full camel loads of it was set inas many separate chambers each of them just large enough to receive thecharge hollowed in the primval rock from which the idol had been hewn</s> these chambers were about twenty feet from each other although if therehad been time to prolong the tunnel the distance should have beenat least forty in order to give the stuff a wider range of action</s> according to olivers mathematical reckoning they were cut in the exactcentre of the base of the idol and about thirty feet below the actualbody of the crouching sphinx</s>  as a matter of fact this reckoning waswrong in several particulars the charges having been set farthertoward the east or head of the sphinx and higher up in the base thanhe supposed</s>  when it is remembered that he had found no opportunityof measuring the monument which practically we had only seen once frombehind under conditions not favourable to accuracy in such respects orof knowing its actual length and depth these trifling errors were notremarkable</s> what was remarkable is that his general plan of operations founded upona mere hypothetical estimate should have proved as accurate as it did</s> at length all was prepared and the deadly castiron flasks had beenpacked in sand together with dynamite cartridges the necessarydetonators electric wires and so forth an anxious and indeed awfultask executed entirely in that stifling atmosphere by the hands of ormeand quick</s>  then began another labour that of the filling in of thetunnels</s>  this it seems was necessary or so i understood lest theexpanding gases following the line of least resistance should blowback as it were through the venthole</s>  what made that task the moredifficult was the need of cutting a little channel in the rock tocontain the wires and thereby lessen the risk of the fracture of thesewires in the course of the buildingup process</s>  of course if by anyaccident this should happen the circuit would be severed and noexplosion would follow when the electric battery was set to work</s> the arrangement was that the mine should be fired on the night ofthat full moon on which we had been told and spies confirmed theinformation the feast of the marriage of barungs daughter to my sonwould be celebrated in the city of harmac</s>  this date was fixed becausethe sultan had announced that so soon as that festivity which coincidedwith the conclusion of the harvest was ended he meant to deliver hisattack on mur</s> also we were anxious that it should be adhered to for another reasonsince we knew that on this day but a small number of priests and guardswould be left in charge of the idol and my son could not be among them</s> now whatever may have been the views of the abati we as christians whobore them no malice did not at all desire to destroy an enormous numberof innocent fung as might have happened if we had fired our mine whenthe people were gathered to sacrifice to their god</s> the fatal day arrived at last</s>  all was completed save for the blockingof the passage which still went on or rather was being reinforced bythe piling up of loose rocks against its mouth at which a hundred or somen laboured incessantly</s>  the firing wires had been led into that littlechamber in the old temple where the dog pharaoh tore out the throat ofshadrach and no inch of them was left unguarded for fear of accident ortreachery</s> the electric batteriestwo of them in case one should failhad beentested but not connected with the wires</s>  there they stood upon thefloor looking innocent enough and we four sat round them like wizardsround their magic pot who await the working of some spell</s>  we were notcheerful who could be under so intense a strain</s>  orme indeed whohad grown pale and thin with continuous labour of mind and body seemedquite worn out</s>  he could not eat nor smoke and with difficulty ipersuaded him to drink some of the native wine</s>  he would not even go tolook at the completion of the work or to test the wires</s> you can see to it he said i have done all i can</s>  now things musttake their chance</s> after our midday meal he lay down and slept quite soundly for severalhours</s>  about four oclock those who were labouring at the piling up ofdbris over the mouth of the tunnel completed their task and in chargeof quick were marched out of the underground city</s> then higgs and i took lamps and went along the length of the wireswhich lay in a little trench covered over with dust removing the dustand inspecting them at intervals</s>  discovering nothing amiss we returnedto the old temple and at its doorway met the mountaineer japhet whothroughout all these proceedings had been our prop and stay</s>  indeedwithout his help and that of his authority over the abati the mine couldnever have been completed at any rate within the time</s> the light of the lamp showed that his face was very anxious</s> what is the matter</s>  i asked</s> o physician he answered i have words for the ear of the captainorme</s>  be pleased to lead me to him</s> we explained that he slept and could not be disturbed but japhet onlyanswered as before addingcome you with me my words are for your ears as well as his</s> so we went into the little room and awoke oliver who sprang up in agreat fright thinking that something untoward had happened at the mine</s> whats wrong</s>  he asked of japhet</s>  have the fung cut the wires</s> nay o orme a worse thing i have discovered that the prince joshuahas laid a plot to steal away herwhosenameishigh</s>
 set out all the story japhet said oliver</s> it is short lord</s>  i have some friends one of whomhe is of my ownblood but ask me not his nameis in the service of the prince</s>  wedrank a cup of wine together which i needed and i suppose it loosedhis tongue</s>  at any rate he told me and i believed him</s>  this is thestory</s>  for his own sake and that of the people the prince desires thatyou should destroy the idol of fung and therefore he has kept hishands off you of late</s>  yet should you succeed he does not know what mayhappen</s>  he fears lest the abati in their gratitude should set you up asgreat men</s> then he is an ass</s>  interrupted quick for the abati have nogratitude</s> he fears went on japhet other things also</s>  for instance that thechild of kings may express that gratitude by a mark of her signal favourtoward one of you and he stared at orme who turned his head aside</s> now the prince is affianced to this great lady whom he desires to wedfor two reasons first because this marriage will make him the chiefman amongst the abati and secondly because of late he has come tothink that he loves her whom he is afraid that he may lose</s>  so he hasset a snare</s> what snare</s>  asked one of us for japhet paused</s> i dont know answered japhet and i do not think that my friend kneweither or if he did he would not tell me</s>  but i understand the plotis that the child of kings is to be carried off to the prince joshuascastle at the other end of the lake six hours ride away and there beforced to marry him at once</s> indeed said orme and when is all this to happen</s> i dont know lord</s>  i know nothing except what my friend told me whichi thought it right to communicate to you instantly</s>  i asked him thetime however and he said that he believed the date was fixed for onenight after next sabbath</s> next sabbath is five days hence so that this matter does not seem tobe very pressing remarked oliver with a sigh of relief</s>  are you surethat you can trust your friend japhet</s> no lord i am not sure especially as i have always known him to be aliar</s>  still i thought that i ought to tell you</s> very kind of you japhet but i wish that you had let me have my sleepout first</s>  now go down the line and see that all is right then returnand report</s> japhet saluted in his native fashion and went</s> what do you think of this story</s>  asked oliver as soon as he was outof hearing</s> all bosh answered higgs the place is full of talk and rumours andthis is one of them</s> he paused and looked at me</s> oh</s>  i said i agree with higgs</s>  if japhets friend had reallyanything to tell he would have told it in more detail</s>  i daresay thereare a good many things joshua would like to do but i expect he willstop there at any rate for the present</s>  if you take my advice you willsay nothing of the matter especially to maqueda</s> then we are all agreed</s>  but what are you thinking of sergeant</s> asked oliver addressing quick who stood in a corner of the room lostapparently in contemplation of the floor</s> i captain he replied coming to attention</s>  well begging theirpardon i was thinking that i dont hold with these gentlemen except inso far that i should say nothing of this job to our lady who has plentyto bother her just now and wont need to be frightened as well</s>  stillthere may be something in it for though that japhet is stupid heshonest and honest men sometimes get hold of the right end of the stick</s> at least he believes there is something and thats what weighs withme</s> well if thats your opinion whats best to be done sergeant</s>  i agreethat the child of kings should not be told and i shant leave thisplace till after ten oclock tonight at the earliest if we stick toour plans as we had better do for all that stuff in the tunnel wantsa little time to settle and for other reasons</s>  what are you drawingthere</s>  and he pointed to the floor in the dust of which quick wastracing something with his finger</s> a plan of our ladys private rooms captain</s>  she told you she was goingto rest at sundown didnt she or earlier for she was up most of lastnight and wanted to get a few hours sleep beforesomething happens</s> well her bedchamber is there isnt it</s>  and another before it inwhich her maids sleep and nothing behind except a high wall and a ditchwhich cannot be climbed</s> thats quite true interrupted higgs</s>  i got leave to make a planof the palace only there is a passage six feet wide and twenty longleading from the guard chamber to the ladies anteroom</s> just so professor and that passage has a turn in it if i rememberright so that two wellarmed men could hold it against quite a lot</s> supposing now that you and i professor should go and take a nap inthat guardroom which will be empty for the watch is set at the palacegate</s>  we shant be wanted here since if the captain cant touch offthat mine no one can with the doctor to help him just in case anythinggoes wrong and japhet guarding the line</s>  i daresay theres nothingin this yarn but who knows</s>  there might be and then we should blameourselves</s>  what do you say professor</s> i</s>  oh ill do anything you wish though i should rather have liked toclimb the cliff and watch what happens</s> youd see nothing higgs interrupted oliver except perhaps thereflection of a flash in the sky so if you dont mind i wish youwould go with the sergeant</s>  somehow although i am quite certain thatwe ought not to alarm maqueda i am not easy about her and if you twofellows were there i should know she was all right and it would be aweight off my mind</s> that settles it said higgs well be off presently</s>  look here giveus that portable telephone which is of no use anywhere else now</s>  thewire will reach to the palace and if the machine works all right we cantalk to you and tell each other how things are going on</s> ten minutes later they had made their preparations</s>  quick stepped up tooliver and stood at attention sayingready to march</s>  any more orders captain</s> i think not sergeant he answered lifting his eyes from the littlebatteries that he was watching as though they were live things</s>  youknow the arrangements</s>  at ten oclockthat is about two hours henceitouch this switch</s>  whatever happens it must not be done before for fearlest the doctors son should not have left the idol to say nothing ofall the other poor beggars</s>  the spies say that the marriage feast willnot be celebrated until at least three hours after moonrise</s> and thats what i heard when i was a prisoner interrupted higgs</s> i daresay answered orme but it is always well to allow a marginin case the procession should be delayed or something</s>  so until tenoclock ive got to stop where i am and you may be sure doctor thatunder no circumstances shall i fire the mine before that hour as indeedyou will be here to see</s>  after that i cant say what will happen butif we dont appear you two had better come to look for usin caseof accidents you know</s>  do your best at your end according tocircumstances the doctor and i will do our best at ours</s>  i think thatis all sergeant</s>  report yourselves by the telephone if the wire is longenough and it will work which i daresay it wont and anyway look outfor us about halfpast ten</s>  goodbye</s> goodbye captain answered quick then stretched out his handshook that of orme and without another word took his lamp and left thechamber</s> an impulse prompted me to follow him leaving orme and higgs discussingsomething before they parted</s>  when he had walked about fifty yards inthe awful silence of that vast underground town of which the ruinedtenements yawned on either side of us the sergeant stopped and saidsuddenlyyou dont believe in presentiments do you doctor</s> not a bit i answered</s> glad of it doctor</s>  still i have got a bad one now and it is that ishant see the captain or you any more</s> then thats a poor lookout for us quick</s> no doctor for me</s>  i think you are both all right and the professortoo</s>  its my name they are calling up aloft or so it seems to me</s>  welli dont care much for though no saint i have tried to do my dutyand if it is done its done</s>  if its written its got to come to passhasnt it</s>  for everything is written down for us long before we beginor so ive always thought</s>  still ill grieve to part from the captainseeing that i nursed him as a child and id have liked to know him wellout of this hole and safely married to that sweet lady first though idont doubt that it will be so</s> nonsense sergeant i said sharply you are not yourself all thiswork and anxiety has got on your nerves</s> as it well might doctor not but i daresay thats true</s>  anyhow if theother is the true thing and you should all see old england again withsome of the stuff in that deadhouse ive got three nieces living downat home whom you might remember</s>  dont say nothing of what i told you tothe captain till this nights game is played seeing that it might upsethim and hell need to keep cool up to ten oclock and afterwards tooperhaps</s>  only if we shouldnt meet again say that samuel quick sent himhis duty and gods blessing</s>  and the same on yourself doctor and yourson too</s>  and now here comes the professor so goodbye</s> a minute later they had left me and i stood watching them until the twostars of light from their lanterns vanished into the blackness</s> chapter xviharmac comes to murslowly and in very bad spirits i retraced my steps to the old templefollowing the line of the telephone wire which higgs and quick hadunreeled as they went</s>  in the sergeants prognostications of evil ihad no particular belief as they seemed to me to be born of thecircumstances which surrounded us and in different ways affected allour minds even that of the buoyant higgs</s> to take my own case for instance</s>  here i was about to assist in an actwhich for aught i knew might involve the destruction of my only son</s>  itwas true we believed that this was the night of his marriage at the townof harmac some miles away and that the tale of our spies supportedthis information</s>  but how could we be sure that the date or the placeof the ceremony had not been changed at the last moment</s>  supposingfor instance that it was held not in the town as arranged but in thecourts of the idol and that the fearful activities of the fiery agentwhich we were about to wake to life should sweep the celebrants intonothingness</s> the thought made me turn cold and yet the deed must be done roderickmust take his chance</s>  and if all were well and he escaped that dangerwere there not worse behind</s>  think of him a christian man the husbandof a savage woman who worshipped a stone image with a lions head boundto her and her tribe a state prisoner trebly guarded whom so faras i could see there would be no hope of rescuing</s>  it was awful</s>  thenthere were other complications</s>  if the plan succeeded and the idol wasdestroyed my own belief was that the fung must thereby be exasperated</s> evidently they knew some road into this stronghold</s>  it would be used</s> they would pour their thousands up it a general massacre would followof which justly we should be the first victims</s> i reached the chamber where oliver sat brooding alone for japhet waspatrolling the line</s> i am not happy about maqueda doctor he said to me</s>  i am afraidthere is something in that story</s>  she wanted to be with us indeed shebegged to be allowed to come almost with tears</s>  but i wouldnt have itsince accidents may always happen the vibration might shake in the roofor something in fact i dont think you should be here</s>  why dont yougo away and leave me</s> i answered that nothing would induce me to do so for such a job shouldnot be left to one man</s> no youre right he said i might faint or lose my head or anything</s> i wish now that we had arranged to send the spark from the palacewhich perhaps we might have done by joining the telephone wire on tothe others</s>  but to tell you the truth im afraid of the batteries</s> the cells are new but very weak for time and the climate have affectedthem and i thought it possible the extra difference might make thedifference and that they would fail to work</s>  thats why i fixed this asthe firing point</s>  hullo theres the bell</s>  what have they got to say</s> i snatched the receiver and presently heard the cheerful voice ofhiggs announcing that they had arrived safely in the little anteroom tomaquedas private apartments</s> the palace seems very empty he added we only met one sentry for ithink that everybody else except maqueda and a few of her ladieshave cleared out being afraid lest rocks should fall on them when theexplosion occurs</s> did the man say so</s>  i asked of higgs</s> yes something of that sort also he wanted to forbid us to come heresaying that it was against the prince joshuas orders that we gentilesshould approach the private apartments of the child of kings</s>  well wesoon settled that and he bolted</s>  where to</s>  oh</s>  i dont know to reporthe said</s> hows quick</s>  i asked</s> much the same as usual</s>  in fact he is saying his prayers in thecorner looking like a melancholy brigand with rifles revolvers andknives stuck all over him</s>  i wish he wouldnt say his prayers addedhiggs and his voice reached me in an indignant squeak it makes mefeel uncomfortable as though i ought to join him</s>  but not having beenbrought up a dissenter or a moslem i cant pray in public as he does</s> hullo</s>  wait a minute will you</s> then followed a longish pause and after it higgss voice again</s> its all right it said</s>  only one of maquedas ladies who had heardus and come to see who we were</s>  when she learns i expect she will joinus here as the girl says shes nervous and cant sleep</s> higgs proved right in his anticipations for in about ten minutes wewere rung up again this time by maqueda herself whereon i handed thereceiver to oliver and retired to the other end of the room</s> nor to tell the truth was i sorry for the interruption since itcheered up oliver and helped to pass the time</s> the next thing worth telling that happened was that an hour or morelater japhet arrived looking very frightened</s>  we asked him our usualquestion if anything was wrong with the wires</s>  with a groan he answeredno the wires seemed all right but he had met a ghost</s> what ghost you donkey</s>  i said</s> the ghost of one of the dead kings o physician yonder in the burialcave</s>  it was he with the bent bones who sits in the farthest chair</s>  onlyhe had put some flesh on his bones and i tell you he looked fearful avery fierce man or rather ghost</s> indeed and did he say anything to you japhet</s> oh</s>  yes plenty o physician only i could not understand it allbecause his language was somewhat different to mine and he spat outhis words as a green log spits out sparks</s>  i think that he asked mehowever how my miserable people dared to destroy his god harmac</s>  ianswered that i was only a servant and did not know adding that heshould put his questions to you</s> and what did he say to that japhet</s> i think he said that harmac would come to mur and settle his accountwith the abati and that the foreign men would be wise to fly fast andfar</s>  thats all i understood ask me no more who would not return intothat cave to be made a prince</s> hes got hold of what barungs envoys told us said oliverindifferently and no wonder this place is enough to make anybody seeghosts</s>  ill repeat it to maqueda it will amuse her</s> i wouldnt if i were you i answered for it isnt exactly a cheerfulyarn and perhaps shes afraid of ghosts too</s>  also and i pointedto the watch that lay on the table beside the batteries it is fiveminutes to ten</s> oh</s>  that last five minutes</s>  it seemed as many centuries</s>  like stonestatues we sat each of us lost in his own thoughts though for my partthe power of clear thinking appeared to have left me</s>  visions of a sortflowed over my mind without sinking into it as water flows over marble</s> all i could do was fix my eyes on the face of that watch of which inthe flickering lamplight the secondhand seemed to my excited fancy togrow enormous and jump from one side of the room to the other</s> orme began to count aloud</s>  one two three four fivenow</s>  andalmost simultaneously he touched the knob first of one battery and nextof the other</s>  before his finger pressed the lefthand knob i felt thesolid rock beneath us surgeno other word conveys its movement</s>  thenthe great stone crosspiece weighing several tons that was set asa transom above the tall door of our room dislodged itself and fellquite gently into the doorway which it completely blocked</s> other rocks fell also at a distance making a great noise and somehowi found myself on the ground my stool had slid away from me</s>  nextfollowed a muffled awful roar and with it came a blast of wind blowingwhere wind never blew before since the beginning of the world that witha terrible wailing howled itself to silence in the thousand recesses ofthe cave city</s>  as it passed our lamps went out</s>  lastly quite a minutelater i should think there was a thud as though something of enormousweight had fallen on the surface of the earth far above us</s> then all was as it had been all was darkness and utter quietude</s> well thats over said oliver in a strained voice which sounded verysmall and far away through that thick darkness all over for good orill</s>  i neednt have been anxious the first battery was strong enoughfor i felt the mine spring as i touched the second</s>  i wonder he wenton as though speaking to himself what amount of damage nearly a tonand a half of that awful azoimide compound has done to the old sphinx</s> according to my calculations it ought to have been enough to break thething up if we could have spread the charge more</s>  but as it is iam by no means certain</s>  it may only have driven a hole in its bulkespecially if there were hollows through which the gases could run</s> well with luck we may know more about it later</s>  strike a match adamsand light those lamps</s>  why whats that</s>  listen</s> as he spoke from somewhere came a series of tiny noises thatthough they were so faint and small suggested rifles fired at a greatdistance</s>  crack crack crack</s>  went the infinitesimal noises</s> i groped about and finding the receiver of the field telephone setit to my ear</s>  in an instant all grew plain to me</s>  guns were being firednear the other end of the wire and the transmitter was sending us thesound of them</s>  very faintly but with distinctness i could hear higgsshigh voice saying look out sergeant theres another rush coming</s> and quick answering shoot low professor for the lords sake shootlow</s>  you are empty sir</s>  load up load up</s>  heres a clip of cartridges</s> dont fire too fast</s>  ah</s>  that devil got me but ive got him hellnever throw another spear</s> they are being attacked</s>  i exclaimed</s>  quick is wounded</s>  now maquedais talking to you</s>  she says oliver come</s>  joshuas men assail me</s> oliver come</s> then followed a great sound of shouting answered by more shots and justas orme snatched the receiver from my hand the wire went dead</s>  in vainhe called down it in an agonized voice</s>  as well might he have addressedthe planet saturn</s> the wires cut he exclaimed dashing down the receiver and seizingthe lantern which japhet had just succeeded in relighting comeon theres murder being done and he sprang to the doorway only tostagger back again from the great stone with which it was blocked</s> good god</s>  he screamed were shut in</s>  how can we get out</s>  how canwe get out</s>
 and he began to run round and round the room and even tospring at the walls like a frightened cat</s>  thrice he sprang striving toclimb to the coping for the place had no roof each time falling backsince it was too high for him to grasp</s>  i caught him round the middleand held him by main force although he struck at me</s>
be quiet i said do you want to kill yourself</s>  you will be no gooddead or maimed</s>  let me think</s> meanwhile japhet was acting on his own account for he too had heardthe tiny ominous sounds given out by the telephone and guessed theirpurport</s>  first he ran to the massive transom that blocked the doorwayand pushed</s>  it was useless not even an elephant could have stirred it</s> then he stepped back examining it carefully</s> i think it can be climbed physician he said</s>  help me now and hemotioned to me to take one end of the heavy table on which the batteriesstood</s>  we dragged it to the doorway and seeing his purpose oliverjumped on to it with him</s>  then at japhets direction while i supportedthe table to prevent its oversetting orme rested his foreheadagainst the stone making what schoolboys call a back up which themountaineer climbed actively until he stood upon his shoulders andby stretching himself was able to grasp the end of the fallen transom</s> next while i held up the lamp to give him light he gripped theroughnesses of the hewn stone with his toes and in a few moments wasupon the coping of the wall twenty feet or more above the floor line</s> the rest was comparatively easy for taking off his linen robe japhetknotted it once or twice and let it down to us</s>  by the help of thisimprovised rope with orme supporting me beneath i too was draggedup to the coping of the wall</s>  then both of us pulled up oliver whowithout a word swung himself over the wall hanging to japhets armsand loosing his hold dropped to the ground on the farther side</s>  nextcame my turn</s>  it was a long fall and had not oliver caught me i thinkthat i should have hurt myself</s>  as it was the breath was shaken outof me</s>  lastly japhet swung himself down landing lightly as a cat</s>  thelamps he had already dropped to us and in another minute they were alllighted and we were speeding down the great cavern</s> be careful i cried there may be fallen rocks about</s> as it happened i was right for at that moment oliver struck his legsagainst one of them and fell cutting himself a good deal</s>  in a momenthe was up again but after this our progress grew slow for hundreds oftons of stone had been shaken from the roof and blocked the path</s>  alsowhole buildings of the ancient and underground city had been throwndown although these were mostly blown inward by the rush of air</s>  atlength we came to the end of the cave and halted dismayed for herewhere the blast of the explosion had been brought to a full stop theplace seemed to be crowded with rocks which it had rolled before it</s> my god</s>  i believe we are shut in exclaimed oliver in despair</s> but japhet lantern in hand was already leaping from block to blockand presently from the top of the dbris called to us to come to him</s> i think there is a road left though a bad one lords he said andpointed to a jagged welllike hole blown out as i believe by therecoil of the blast</s>  with difficulty and danger for many of the piledup stones were loose we climbed down this place and at its bottomsqueezed ourselves through a narrow aperture on to the floor of thecave praying that the huge door which led to the passage beyond mightnot be jammed since if it were as we knew well our small strengthwould not avail to move it</s>  happily this fear at least provedgroundless since it opened outward and the force of the compressed airhad torn it from its massive stone hinges and thrown it shattered to theground</s> we scrambled over it and advanced down the passage our revolversin our hands</s>  we reached the audience hall which was empty and indarkness</s>  we turned to the left crossing various chambers and in thelast of them through which one of the gates of the palace could beapproached met with the first signs of the tragedy for there werebloodstains on the floor</s> orme pointed to them as he hurried on and suddenly a man leapt out ofthe darkness as a buck leaps from a bush and ran past us holding hishands to his side where evidently he had some grievous hurt</s>  now weentered the corridor leading to the private apartments of the child ofkings and found ourselves walking on the bodies of dead and dying men</s> one of the former i observed as one does notice little things at sucha moment held in his hand the broken wire of the field telephone</s>  ipresume that he had snatched and severed it in his death pang at themoment when communication ceased between us and the palace</s> we rushed into the little antechamber in which lights were burning andthere saw a sight that i for one never shall forget</s> in the foreground lay more dead men all of them wearing the livery ofprince joshua</s>  beyond was sergeant quick seated on a chair</s>  he seemedto be literally hacked to pieces</s>  an arrow that no one had attempted toremove was fast in his shoulder his head which maqueda was spongingwith wet clothswell i will not describe his wounds</s> leaning against the wall near by stood higgs also bleeding andapparently quite exhausted</s>  behind besides maqueda herself were two orthree of her ladies wringing their hands and weeping</s>  in face of thisterrible spectacle we came to a sudden halt</s>  no word was spoken of byany one for the power of speech had left us</s> the dying quick opened his eyes lifted his hand upon which there wasa ghastly swordcut to his forehead as though to shade them from thelightah</s>  how well i recall that pathetic motionand from beneath thisscreen stared at us a while</s>  then he rose from the chair touched histhroat to show that he could not speak as i suppose saluted ormeturned and pointed to maqueda and with a triumphant smile sank downanddied</s> such was the noble end of sergeant quick</s> to describe what followed is not easy for the scene was confused</s>  alsoshock and sorrow have blurred its recollection in my mind</s>  i remembermaqueda and orme falling into each others arms before everybody</s> i remember her drawing herself up in that imperial way of hers andsaying as she pointed to the body of quickthere lies one who has shown us how to die</s>  this countryman of yourswas a hero o oliver and you should hold his memory in honour since hesaved me from worse than death</s> whats the story</s>  asked orme of higgs</s> a simple one enough he answered</s>  we got here all right as we toldyou over the wire</s>  then maqueda talked to you for a long while untilyou rang off saying you wanted to speak to japhet</s>  after that at tenoclock precisely we heard the thud of the explosion</s>  next as we werepreparing to go out to see what had happened joshua arrived aloneannounced that the idol harmac had been destroyed and demanded thatthe child of kings for state reasons should accompany him to his owncastle</s>  she declined and as he insisted i took it upon myself to kickhim out of the place</s>  he retired and we saw no more of him but a fewminutes later there came a shower of arrows down the passage and afterthem a rush of men who called death to the gentiles</s>  rescue therose</s> so we began to shoot and knocked over a lot of them but quick gotthat arrow through his shoulder</s>  three times they came on like that andthree times we drove them back</s>
 they hung amoment but moved forward again and all seemed up</s> then quick went mad</s>  he snatched the sword of a dead abati and ran atthem roaring like a bull</s>  they hacked and cut at him but the end ofit was that he drove them right out of the passage while i followedfiring past him</s> well those who were left of the blackguards bolted and when they hadgone the sergeant tumbled down</s>  the women and i carried him back herebut he never said another word and at last you turned up</s>  now hesgone god rest him for if ever there was a hero in this world he waschristened samuel quick</s>  and turning aside the professor pushed upthe blue spectacles he always wore on to his forehead and wiped hiseyes with the back of his hand</s> with grief more bitter than i can describe we lifted up the body of thegallant quick and bearing it into maquedas private apartment placedit on her own bed for she insisted that the man who had died to protecther should be laid nowhere else</s>  it was strange to see the grim oldsoldier whose face now that i had washed his wounds looked calm andeven beautiful laid out to sleep his last sleep upon the couch of thechild of kings</s>  that bed i remember was a rich and splendid thingmade of some black wood inlaid with scrolls of gold and having hungabout it curtains of white net embroidered with golden stars such asmaqueda wore upon her official veil</s> there upon the scented pillows and silken coverlet we set our burdendown the workworn hands clasped upon the breast in an attitude ofprayer and one by one bid our farewell to this faithful and uprightman whose face as it chanced we were never to see again except inthe glass of memory</s>  well he had died as he had lived and would havewished to diedoing his duty and in war</s>  and so we left him</s>  peace beto his honoured spirit</s> in the bloodstained anteroom while i dressed and stitched up theprofessors wounds a swordcut on the head an arrowgraze along theface and a spearprick in the thigh none of them happily at all deepor dangerous we held a brief council</s> friends said maqueda who was leaning on her lovers arm it isnot safe that we should stop here</s>  my uncles plot has failed for themoment but it was only a small and secret thing</s>  i think that soon hewill return again with a thousand at his back and thenwhat is in your mind</s>  asked oliver</s>  to fly from mur</s> how can we fly she answered when the pass is guarded by joshuasmen and the fung wait for us without</s>  the abati hate you my friendsand now that you have done your work i think that they will kill you ifthey can whom they bore with only till it was done</s>  alas</s>  alas</s>  that ishould have brought you to this false and ungrateful country and shebegan to weep while we stared at each other helpless</s> then japhet who all this while had been crouched on the floor rockinghimself too and fro and mourning in his eastern fashion for quickwhom he had loved rose and coming to the child of kings prostratedhimself before her</s> o walda nagasta he said hear the words of your servant</s>  only threemiles away near to the mouth of the pass are encamped five hundredmen of my own people the mountaineers who hate prince joshua and hisfollowing</s>  fly to them o walda nagasta for they will cleave to you andlisten to me whom you have made a chief among them</s>  afterwards you canact as may seem wisest</s> maqueda looked at oliver questioningly</s> i think that is good advice he said</s>  at any rate we cant be worseoff among the mountaineers than we are in this undefended place</s>  tellyour women to bring cloaks that we can throw over our heads and let usgo</s> five minutes later a forlorn group filled with fears we had stolenover the dead and dying in the passage and made our way to the sidegate of the palace that we found open and over the bridge that spannedthe moat beyond which was down</s>  doubtless joshuas ruffians had usedit in their approach and retreat</s>  disguised in the long cloaks withmonklike hoods that the abati wore at night or when the weather wascold and wet we hurried across the great square</s>  here since we couldnot escape them we mingled with the crowd that was gathered at itsfarther end all of themmen women and childrenchattering likemonkeys in the treetops and pointing to the cliff at the back of thepalace beneath which it will be remembered lay the underground city</s> a band of soldiers rode by thrusting their way through the people andin order to avoid them we thought it wise to take refuge in the shadowof a walk of greenleaved trees which grew close at hand for we fearedlest they might recognize oliver by his height</s>  here we turned andlooked up at the cliff to discover what it was at which every one wasstaring</s>  at that moment the full moon which had been obscured by acloud broke out and we saw a spectacle that under the circumstanceswas nothing less than terrifying</s> the cliff behind the palace rose to a height of about a hundred andfifty feet and as it chanced just there a portion of it jutted outin an oblong shape which the abati called the lion rock althoughpersonally heretofore i had never been able to see in it any greatresemblance to a lion</s>  now however it was different for on the veryextremity of this rock staring down at mur sat the head and neck ofthe huge lionfaced idol of the fung</s>  indeed in that light with thepromontory stretching away behind it it looked as though it werethe idol itself moved from the valley upon the farther side of theprecipice to the top of the cliff above</s> oh</s>  oh</s>  oh</s>  groaned japhet the prophecy is fulfilledthe head ofharmac has come to sleep at mur</s> you mean that we have sent him there whispered higgs</s>  dont befrightened man cant you understand that the power of our medicine hasblown the head off the sphinx high into the air and landed it where itsits now</s> yes i put in and what we felt in the cave was the shock of itsfall</s> i dont care what brought him replied japhet who seemed quiteunstrung by all that he had gone through</s>  all i know is that theprophecy is fulfilled and harmac has come to mur and where harmac goesthe fung follow</s> so much the better said the irreverent higgs</s>  i may be able tosketch and measure him now</s> but i saw that maqueda was trembling for she too thought thisoccurrence a very bad omen and even oliver remained silent perhapsbecause he feared its effect upon the abati</s> nor was this wonderful since from the talk around us clearly thateffect was great</s>  evidently the people were terrified like japhet</s>  wecould hear them foreboding ill and cursing us gentiles as wizardswho had not destroyed the idol of the fung as we promised but had onlycaused him to fly to mur</s> here i may mention that as a matter of fact they were right</s>  as wediscovered afterwards the whole force of the explosion instead ofshattering the vast bulk of the stone image had rushed up through thehollow chambers in its interior until it struck against the solid head</s> lifting this as though it were a toy the expanding gas had hurled thatmighty mass an unknown distance into the air to light upon the crest ofthe cliffs of mur where probably it will remain forever</s> well i said when we had stared a little while at this extraordinaryphenomenon thank god it did not travel farther and fall upon thepalace</s> oh</s>  had it done so whispered maqueda in a tearful voice i think youmight have thanked god indeed for then at least i should be freefrom all my troubles</s>  come friends let us be going before we arediscovered</s> chapter xviii find my sonour road toward the pass ran through the camping ground of the newlycreated abati army and what we saw on our journey thither told usmore vividly than any words or reports could do how utter was thedemoralization of that people</s>  where should have been sentries wereno sentries where should have been soldiers were groups of officerstalking with women where should have been officers were camp followersdrinking</s> through this confusion and excitement we made our way unobserved orat any rate unquestioned till at length we came to the regiment of themountaineers who for the most part were goatherds poor people wholived upon the slopes of the precipices that enclosed the land of mur</s> these folk having little to do with their more prosperous brethren ofthe plain were hardy and primitive of nature and therefore retainedsome of the primeval virtues of mankind such as courage and loyalty</s> it was for the first of these reasons and indeed for the second alsothat they had been posted by joshua at the mouth of the pass which heknew well they alone could be trusted to defend in the event of seriousattack</s>  moreover it was desirable from his point of view to keep themout of the way while he developed his plans against the person of thechild of kings for whom these simpleminded men had a hereditary andalmost a superstitious reverence</s> as soon as we were within the lines of these mountaineers we found thedifference between them and the rest of the abati</s>  the other regimentswe had passed unchallenged but here we were instantly stopped by apicket</s>  japhet whispered something into the ear of its officer thatcaused him to stare hard at us</s>  then this officer saluted the veiledfigure of the child of kings and led us to where the commander of theband and his subordinates were seated near a fire sitting together</s>  atsome sign or word that did not reach us the commander an old fellowwith a long grey beard rose and saidyour pardon but be pleased to show your faces</s> maqueda threw back her hood and turned so that the light of the moonfell full upon her whereon the old man dropped to his knee sayingyour commands o walda nagasta</s> summon your regiment and i will give them she answered and seatedherself on a bench by the fire we three and japhet standing behind her</s> the commander issued orders to his captains and presently themountaineers formed up on three sides of a square above us to thenumber of a little over five hundred men</s>  when all were gathered maquedamounted the bench upon which she had been sitting threw back her hoodso that every one could see her face in the light of the fire andaddressed themmen of the mountainside this night just after the idol of the funghad been destroyed the prince joshua my uncle came to me demandingmy surrender to him whether to kill me or to imprison me in his castlebeyond the end of the lake for reasons of state as he said or forother vile purposes i do not know</s> at these words a murmur rose from the audience</s> wait said maqueda holding up her hand there is worse to come</s> i told my uncle prince joshua that he was a traitor and had best begone</s>  he went threatening me and when i do not know withdrew theguards that should be stationed at my palace gates</s>  now some rumour ofmy danger had reached the foreigners in my service and two of themhe who is called black windows whom we rescued from the fung and thesoldier named quick came to watch over me while the lord orme and thedoctor adams stayed in the cave to send out that spark of fire whichshould destroy the idol</s>  nor did they come back without need forpresently arrived a band of prince joshuas men to take me</s> then black windows and the soldier his companion fought a good fightthey two holding the narrow passage against many and slaying a numberof them with their terrible weapons</s>  the end of it was men of themountains that the warrior quick charging down the passage droveaway those servants of joshua who remained alive</s>  but in so doing he waswounded to the death</s>  yes that brave man lies dead having given hislife to save the child of kings from the hands of her own people</s>  blackwindows also was woundedsee the bandages about his head</s>  then came thelord orme and the doctor adams and with them your brother japhet whohad barely escaped with their lives from the cave city and knowing thati was no longer safe in the palace where even my sleepingroom has beendrenched with blood with them i have fled to you for succour</s>  will younot protect me o men of the mountainside</s> yes yes they answered with a great shout</s>  command we obey</s>  whatshall we do o child of kings</s> now maqueda called the officers of the regiment apart and consulted withthem asking their opinions one by one</s>  some of them were in favour offinding out where joshua might be and attacking him at once</s>  crush thesnakes head and its tail will soon cease wriggling</s>  these said and iconfess this was a view that in many ways commended itself to us</s> but maqueda would have none of it</s> what</s>  she exclaimed shall i begin a civil war among my people whenfor aught i know the enemy is at our gates</s>  adding aside to us alsohow can these few hundred men brave though they be hope to standagainst the thousands under the command of joshua</s> what then would you do</s>  asked orme</s> return to the palace with these mountaineers o oliver and by help ofthat garrison hold it against all enemies</s> very well he replied</s>  to those who are quite lost one road is asgood as another they must trust to the stars to guide them</s> quite so echoed higgs and the sooner we go the better for my leghurts and i want a sleep</s> so maqueda gave her commands to the officers by whom they were conveyedto the regiment which received them with a shout and instantly beganto strike its camp</s> then it was coming hotfoot after so much sorrow loss and doubt thatthere followed the happiest event of all my life</s>  utterly tired out andvery despondent i was seated on an arrowchest awaiting the order tomarch idly watching oliver and maqueda talking with great earnestnessat a little distance and in the intervals trying to prevent poor higgsat my side from falling asleep</s>  while i was thus engaged suddenly iheard a disturbance and by the bright moonlight caught sight of a manbeing led into the camp in charge of a guard of abati soldiers whomfrom their dress i knew to belong to a company that just then wasemployed in watching the lower gates of the pass</s> i took no particular heed of the incident thinking only that they mighthave captured some spy till a murmur of astonishment and the generalstir warned me that something unusual had occurred</s>  so i rose from mybox and strolled towards the man who now was hidden from me by a groupof mountaineers</s>  as i advanced this group opened the men who composedit bowing to me with a kind of wondering respect that impressed me idid not know why</s> then for the first time i saw the prisoner</s>  he was a tall athleticyoung man dressed in festal robes with a heavy gold chain about hisneck and i wondered vaguely what such a person should be doing herein this time of national commotion</s>  he turned his head so that themoonlight showed his dark eyes his somewhat ovalshaped face ending ina peaked black beard and his finely cut features</s>  in an instant i knewhim</s> it was my son roderick</s> next moment for the first time for very many years he was in my arms</s> the first thing that i remember saying to him was a typicallyanglosaxon remark for however much we live in the east or elsewherewe never really shake off our native conventions and habits of speech</s> it was how are you my boy and how on earth did you come here</s> to which he answered slowly it is true and speaking with a foreignaccentall right thank you father</s>  i ran upon my legs</s> by this time higgs hobbled up and was greeting my son warmly for ofcourse they were old friends</s> thought you were to be married tonight roderick</s>  he said</s> yes yes he answered i am half married according to fung customwhich counts not to my soul</s>  look this is the dress of marriage andhe pointed to his fine embroidered robe and rich ornaments</s> then wheres your wife</s>  asked higgs</s> i do not know and i do not care he answered for i did not likethat wife</s>  also it is all nothing as i am not quite married to her</s> fung marriage between big people takes two days to finish and if notfinished does not matter</s>  so she marry some one else if she like and itoo</s> what happened then</s>  i asked</s> oh this father</s>  when we had eaten the marriage feast but before wepast before priest suddenly we hear a thunder and see a pillar of fireshoot up into sky and sitting on top of it head of harmac which vanishinto heaven and stop there</s>  then everybody jump up and saymagic of white man</s>  magic of white man</s>  white man kill the god whosit there from beginning of world now day of fung finished according toprophecy</s>  run away people of fung run away</s> barung the sultan tear his clothes too and sayrun away fungand my halfwife she tear her clothes and say nothing but run likeantelope</s>  so they all run toward east where great river is and leaveme alone</s>  then i get up and run tootoward west for i know from blackwindows and he pointed to higgs when we shut up together in belly ofgod before he let down to lions what all this game mean and thereforenot frightened</s>  well i run meeting no one in night till i come topass run up it and find guards to whom i tell story so they not killme but let me through and at last i come here quite safe withoutfung wife thank god and that end of tale</s> i am afraid you are wrong there my boy i said out of thefryingpan into the fire thats all</s> out of fryingpan into fire he repeated</s>  not understand father mustremember i only little fellow when khalifas people take me andsince then speak no english till i meet black windows</s>  only he give mebiblebook that he have in pocket when he go down to be eat by lions</s> here higgs blushed for no one ever suspected him a severe critic ofall religions of carrying a bible in his pocket and muttered somethingabout ancient customs of the hebrews</s> well went on roderick read that book ever since and as you seeall my english come back</s> the question is said higgs evidently in haste to talk of somethingelse will the fung come back</s> oh</s>  black windows dont know cant say</s>  think not</s>  their prophecy wasthat harmac move to mur but when they see his head jump into sky andstop there they run every man toward the sunrise and i think go onrunning</s> but harmac has come to mur roderick i said at least his head hasfallen on to the cliff that overlooks the city</s> oh</s>  my father he answered then that make great difference</s>  whenfung find out that head of harmac has come here no doubt they comeafter him for head his most holy bit especially as they want hang allthe abati whom they not like</s> well lets hope that they dont find out anything about it ireplied to change the subject</s>  then taking roderick by the hand i ledhim to where maqueda stood a yard or two apart listening to our talkbut of course understanding very little of it and introduced him toher explaining in a few words the wonderful thing that had happened</s> she welcomed him very kindly and congratulated me upon my sons escape</s> meanwhile roderick had been staring at her with evident admiration</s>  nowhe turned to us and said in his quaint broken englishwalda nagasta most lovely woman</s>  no wonder king solomon love hermother</s>  if barungs daughter my wife had been like her think i runthrough great river into rising sun with fung</s> oliver instantly translated this remark which made us all laughincluding maqueda herself and very grateful we were to find theopportunity for a little innocent merriment upon that tragic night</s> by this time the regiment was ready to start and had formed up intocompanies</s>  before the march actually began however the officer of theabati patrol in whose charge roderick had been brought to usdemanded his surrender that he might deliver his prisoner to thecommanderinchief prince joshua</s>  of course this was refused whereonthe man asked roughlyby whose order</s> as it happened maqueda of whose presence he was not aware heard himand acting on some impulse came forward and unveiled</s> by mine she said</s>  know that the child of kings rules the abati notthe prince joshua and that prisoners taken by her soldiers are hersnot his</s>  be gone back to your post</s> the captain stared saluted and went with his companions not to thepass indeed as he had been ordered but to joshua</s>  to him he reportedthe arrival of the gentiles son and the news he brought that thenation of the fung dismayed by the destruction of their god were infull flight from the plains of harmac purposing to cross the greatriver and to return no more</s> this glad tidings spread like wildfire so fast indeed that almostbefore we had begun our march we heard the shouts of exultation withwhich it was received by the terrified mob gathered in the great square</s> the cloud of terror was suddenly lifted from them</s>  they went madin their delight they lit bonfires they drank they feasted theyembraced each other and boasted of their bravery that had caused themighty nation of the fung to flee away for ever</s> meanwhile our advance had begun nor in the midst of the generaljubilation was any particular notice taken of us till we were in themiddle of the square of mur and within half a mile of the palacewhen we saw by the moonlight that a large body of troops two or threethousand of them were drawn up in front of us apparently to bar ourway</s>  still we went on till a number of officers rode up and addressingthe commander of the regiment of mountaineers demanded to know why hehad left his post and whither he went</s> i go whither i am ordered he answered for there is one here greaterthan i</s> if you mean the gentile orme and his fellows the command of the princejoshua is that you hand them over to us that they may make report to himof their doings this night</s> and the command of the child of kings is replied the captain of themountaineers that i take them with her back to the palace</s> it has no weight said the spokesman insolently not being endorsedby the council</s>  surrender the gentiles hand over to us the person ofthe child of kings of whom you have taken possession and return to yourpost till the pleasure of the prince joshua be known</s> then the wrath of maqueda blazed up</s> seize those men</s>  she said and it was done instantly</s>  now cut thehead from him who dared to demand the surrender of my person and ofmy officers and give it to his companions to take back to the princejoshua as my answer to his message</s> the man heard and being a coward like all the abati flung himself uponhis face before maqueda trying to kiss her robe and pleading for mercy</s> dog</s>  she answered you were one of those who this very night daredto attack my chamber</s>  oh</s>  lie not i knew your voice and heard yourfellowtraitors call you by your name</s>  away with him</s> we tried to interfere but she would not listen even to orme</s> would you plead for your brothers murderer</s>  she asked alluding toquick</s>  i have spoken</s> so they dragged him off behind us and presently we saw a melancholyprocession returning whence they came carrying something on a shield</s> it reached the opposing ranks whence there arose a murmur of wrath andfear</s> march on</s>  said maqueda and gain the palace</s> so the regiment formed into a square and setting maqueda and ourselvesin the centre of it advanced again</s> then the fight began</s>  great numbers of the abati surrounded us and asthey did not dare to make a direct attack commenced shooting arrowswhich killed and wounded a number of men</s>  but the highlanders also werearchers and carried stronger bows</s>  the square was halted the firstranks kneeling and the second standing behind them</s>  then at a givenword the stiff bows which these hardy people used against the lion andthe buffalo upon their hills were drawn to the ear and loosed again andagain with terrible effect</s> on that open place it was almost impossible to miss the mobs of theabati who having no experience of war were fighting without order</s>  norcould the light mail they wore withstand the rush of the heavy barbedarrows which pierced them through and through</s>  in two minutes they beganto give in three they were flying back to their main body those whowere left of them a huddled rout of men and horses</s>  so the frenchmust have fled before the terrible longbows of the english at crcyand poitiers for in fact we were taking part in just such a medivalbattle</s> oliver who was watching intently went to japhet and whisperedsomething in his ear</s>  he nodded and ran to seek the commander of theregiment</s>  presently the result of that whisper became apparent forthe sides of the hollow square wheeled outward and the rear moved up tostrengthen the centre</s> now the mountaineers were ranged in a double or triple line behindwhich were only about a dozen soldiers who marched round maquedaholding their shields aloft in order to protect her from stray arrows</s> with these too came our four selves a number of campfollowers andothers carrying on their shields those of the regiment who were toobadly wounded to walk</s> leaving the dead where they lay we began to advance pouring in volleysof arrows as we went</s>  twice the abati tried to charge us and twicethose dreadful arrows drove them back</s>  then at the word of command thehighlanders slung their bows upon their backs drew their short swordsand in their turn charged</s> five minutes afterwards everything was over</s>  joshuas soldiers threwdown their arms and ran or galloped to right and left save a numberof them who fled through the gates of the palace which they had openedand across the drawbridge into the courtyards within</s>  after them orrather mixed up with them followed the mountaineers killing all whomthey could find for they were out of hand and would not listen to thecommands of maqueda and their officers that they should show mercy</s> so just as the dawn broke this strange moonlit battle ended a smallaffair it is true for there were only five hundred men engaged uponour side and three or four thousand on the other yet one that costa great number of lives and was the beginning of all the ruin thatfollowed</s> well we were safe for a while since it was certain after the lessonwhich he had just learned that joshua would not attempt to storm thedouble walls and fosse of the palace without long preparation</s>  yet evennow a new trouble awaited us for by some means we never discoveredhow that wing of the palace in which maquedas private rooms weresituated suddenly burst into flames</s> personally i believe that the fire arose through the fact that a lamphad been left burning near the bed of the child of kings upon whichwas laid the body of sergeant quick</s>  perhaps a wounded man hidden thereoverturned the lamp perhaps the draught blowing through the open doorsbrought the goldspangled curtains into contact with the wick</s> at any rate the woodpanelled chambers took fire and had it nothappened that the set of the wind was favourable the whole palacemight have been consumed</s>  as it was we succeeded in confining theconflagration to this particular part of it which within two hours hadburnt out leaving nothing standing but the stark stone walls</s> such was the funeral pyre of sergeant quick a noble one i thought tomyself as i watched it burn</s> when the fire was so well under control for we had pulled down theconnecting passage where higgs and quick fought their great fight thatthere was no longer any danger of its spreading and the watches hadbeen set at length we got some rest</s>
maqueda and two or three of her ladies one of them i remember herold nurse who had brought her up for her mother died at her birth tookpossession of some empty rooms of which there were many in the palacewhile we lay or rather fell down in the guestchambers where we hadalways slept and never opened our eyes again until the evening</s> i remember that i woke thinking that i was the victim of some wonderfuldream of mingled joy and tragedy</s>  oliver and higgs were sleeping likelogs but my son roderick still dressed in his bridal robes had risenand sat by my bed staring at me a puzzled look upon his handsome face</s> so you are here i said taking his hand</s>  i thought i dreamed</s> no father he answered in his odd english no dream all true</s> this is a strange world father</s>  look

here come man to talk to you</s> the man proved to be japhet who had been sent by the child of kings tosummon us as she had news to tell</s>  so i woke the others and after ihad dressed the professors flesh wounds which were stiff and sorewe joined her where she sat in the gateway tower of the inner wall</s>  shegreeted us rather sadly asked oliver how he had slept and higgs if hiscuts hurt him</s>  then she turned to my son and congratulated him upon hiswonderful escape and upon having found a father if he had lost a wife</s> truly she added you are a fortunate man to be so well loved oson of adams</s>  to how many sons are given fathers who for fourteen longyears abandoning all else would search for them in peril of theirlives enduring slavery and blows and starvation and the deserts

back to him and to hismemory until the last hour of your life child of adams</s> i will indeed i will o walda nagasta answered roderick andthrowing his arms about my neck he embraced me before them all</s>  it isnot too much to say that this kiss of filial devotion more than repaidme for all i had undergone for his beloved sake</s>  for now i knew that ihad not toiled and suffered for one of no

laugh for i know nothow long our store will last</s>  listen</s>  i have received a last offer frommy uncle joshua</s>  an arrow brought itnot a man i think that no manwould come lest his fate should

have bewitchedyou and led you to shed the blood of so many of your people and withthem the officers of the mountaineers and the rest shall be spared</s>  youalso i will forgive and make my wife</s>  resist and all who cling to youshall be put to the sword and to yourself i promise nothing</s> written by order of the counciljoshua prince of the abati</s> what answer shall i send</s>  she asked looking at us curiously</s> upon my word replied orme shrugging his shoulders if it were notfor those faithful officers i am not sure but that you would be wiseto accept the terms</s>  we are cooped up here but a few surrounded bythousands who if they dare not assault still can starve us out asthis place is not victualled for a siege</s> you forget one of those terms o oliver</s>  she said slowly pointingwith her finger to the passage in the letter which stated that joshuawould make her his wife now do you still counsel surrender</s> how can i</s>  he answered flushing and was silent</s> well it does not matter what you counsel she went on with a smileseeing that i have already sent my answer also by arrow</s>  see here isa copy of it and she readto my rebellious people of the abatisurrender to me joshua my uncle and the members of the council whohave lifted sword against me to be dealt with according to the ancientlaw and the rest of you shall go unharmed</s>  refuse and i swear to youthat before the night of the new moon has passed there shall be such woein mur as fell upon the city of david when the barbarian standards wereset upon her walls</s>  such is the counsel that has come to me the childof solomon in the watches of the night and i tell you that it is true</s> do what you will people of the abati or what you must since your fateand ours are written</s>  but be sure that in me and the western lords liesyour only hope</s> walda nagasta</s> what do you mean o maqueda i asked about the counsel that came toyou in the watches of the night</s> what i say o adams she answered calmly</s>  after we parted at dawn islept heavily and in my sleep a dark and royal woman stood beforeme whom i knew to be my great ancestress the beloved of solomon</s>  shelooked on me sadly yet as i thought with love</s>  then she drew back asit were a curtain of thick cloud that hid the future and revealed to methe young moon riding the sky and beneath it mur a blackened ruin herstreets filled with dead</s>  yes and she showed to me other things thoughi may not tell them which also shall come to pass then held her handsover me as if in blessing and was gone</s> old hebrew prophet business</s>  very interesting i heard higgs mutterbelow his breath while in my own heart i set the dream down toexcitement and want of food</s>  in fact only two of us were impressed myson very much and oliver a little perhaps because everything maquedasaid was gospel to him</s> doubtless all will come to pass as you say walda nagasta saidroderick with conviction</s>  the day of the abati is finished</s> why do you say that son</s>  i asked</s> because father among the fung people from a child i have two officesthat of singer to the god and that of reader of dreams</s>  oh</s>  do notlaugh</s>  i can tell you many that have come true as i read them thus thedream of barung which i read to mean that the head of harmac would cometo mur and see there it sit and turning he pointed through thedoorway of the tower to the grim lionhead of the idol crouched upon thetop of the precipice watching mur as a beast of prey watches the victimupon which it is about to spring</s>  i know when dreams true and whendreams false it my gift like my voice</s>  i know that this dream truethat all and as he ceased speaking i saw his eyes catch maquedas anda very curious glance pass between them</s> as for orme he only saidyou easterns are strange people and if you believe a thing maquedathere may be something in it</s>
 but you understand that this message ofyours means war to the last a very unequal war and he looked at thehordes of the abati gathering on the great square</s> yes she answered quietly i understand but however sore ourstraits and however strange may seem the things that happen have nofear of the end of that war o my friends</s> chapter xviiithe burning of the palaceorme was right</s>  maquedas defiance did mean war an unequal war</s>  thiswas our position</s>
 we were shut up in a long range of buildings of whichone end had been burned that on account of their moat and double wallif defended with any vigour could only be stormed by an enemy of greatcourage and determination prepared to face a heavy sacrifice oflife</s>  this was a circumstance in our favour since the abati were notcourageous and very much disliked the idea of being killed or eveninjured</s> but here our advantage ended</s>  deducting those whom we had lost onthe previous night the garrison only amounted to something over fourhundred men of whom about fifty were wounded some of them dangerously</s> moreover ammunition was short for they had shot away most of theirarrows in the battle of the square and we had no means of obtainingmore</s>  but worst of all the palace was not provisioned for a siegeand the mountaineers had with them only three days rations of sundriedbeef or goats flesh and a hard kind of biscuit made of indian cornmixed with barley meal</s>  thus as we saw from the beginning unless wecould manage to secure more food our case must soon grow hopeless</s> there remained yet another danger</s>  although the palace itself wasstonebuilt its gilded domes and ornamental turrets were of timber andtherefore liable to be fired as indeed had already happened</s>  the roofalso was of ancient cedar beams thinly covered with concrete while theinterior containing an enormous quantity of panels or rather boardingcut from some resinous wood</s> the abati on the other hand were amply supplied with every kind ofstore and weapon and could bring a great force to blockade us thoughthat force was composed of a timid and undisciplined rabble</s> well we made the best preparations that we could although of these idid not see much since all that day my time was occupied in attendingto the wounded with the help of my son and a few rough orderlies whoseexperience in doctoring had for the most part been confined to cattle</s> a pitiful business it proved without the aid of ansthetics or a propersupply of bandages and other appliances</s>  although my medicine chest hadbeen furnished upon a liberal scale it proved totally inadequate to thecasualties of battle</s>  still i did my best and saved some lives thoughmany cases developed gangrene and slipped through my fingers</s> meanwhile higgs who worked nobly notwithstanding his flesh woundswhich pained him considerably and orme were also doing their bestwith the assistance of japhet and the other officers of the highlandregiment</s>  the palace was thoroughly examined and all weak places in itsdefences were made good</s>  the available force was divided into watchesand stationed to the best advantage</s>  a number of men were set to work tomanufacture arrow shafts from cedar beams of which there were plentyin the wooden stables and outhouses that lay at the back of the mainbuilding and to point and wing the same from a supply of iron barbs andfeathers which fortunately was discovered in one of the guardhouses</s>  afew horses that remained in a shed were killed and salted down for foodand so forth</s> also every possible preparation was made to repel attempts to stormpaving stones being piled up to throw upon the heads of assailants andfires lighted on the walls to heat pitch and oil and water for the samepurpose</s> but to our disappointment no direct assault was delivered suchdesperate methods not commending themselves to the abati</s>  their plan ofattack was to take cover wherever they could especially among the treesof the garden beyond the gates and thence shoot arrows at any one whoappeared upon the walls or even fire them in volleys at the clouds asthe normans did at hastings so that they might fall upon the headsof persons in the courtyards</s>  although these cautious tactics cost usseveral men they had the advantage of furnishing us with a supply ofammunition which we sorely needed</s>  all the spent arrows were carefullycollected and made use of against the enemy at whom we shot wheneveropportunity offered</s>  we did them but little damage however since theywere extremely careful not to expose themselves</s> in this fashion three dreary days went past unrelieved by any incidentexcept a feint for it was scarcely more which the abati made uponthe second night apparently with the object of forcing the great gatesunder cover of a rainstorm</s>  the advance was discovered at once andrepelled by two or three volleys of arrows and some rifle shots</s>  ofthese rifles indeed whereof we possessed about a score the abati wereterribly afraid</s>  picking out some of the most intelligent soldiers wetaught them how to handle our spare guns and though of course theirshooting was extremely erratic the result of it backed up by ourown more accurate marksmanship was to force the enemy to take cover</s> indeed after one or two experiences of the effect of bullets not a manwould show himself in the open within five hundred yards until night hadfallen</s> on the third afternoon we held a council to determine what must be donesince for the last twentyfour hours it had been obvious that thingscould not continue as they were</s>  to begin with we had only sufficientfood left to keep our force from starvation for two more days</s>  alsothe spirits of our soldiers brave men enough when actual fightingwas concerned were beginning to flag in this atmosphere of inaction</s> gathered into groups they talked of their wives and children and ofwhat would happen to them at the hands of joshua also of their cattleand crops saying that doubtless these were being ravaged and theirhouses burned</s>  in vain did maqueda promise them fivefold their losswhen the war was ended for evidently in their hearts they thought itcould only end one way</s>  moreover as they pointed out she could notgive them back their children if these were killed</s> at this melancholy council every possible plan was discussed to findthat these resolved themselves into two alternativesto surrenderor to take the bull by the horns sally out of the palace at night andattack joshua</s>  on the face of it this latter scheme had the appearanceof suicide but in fact it was not so desperate as it seemed</s>  theabati being such cowards it was quite probable that they would run intheir thousands before the onset of a few hundred determined men andthat if once victory declared itself for the child of kings the bulkof her subjects would return to their allegiance</s>  so we settled on it inpreference to surrender which we knew meant death to ourselves and formaqueda a choice between that last grim solution of her troubles and aforced marriage</s> but there were others to be convinced namely the mountaineers</s>  japhetwho had been present at the council was sent to summon all of themexcept those actually on guard and when they were assembled in thelarge inner court maqueda went out and addressed them</s> i do not remember the exact words of her speech and i made no note ofthem but it was extremely beautiful and touching</s>  she pointed out herplight and that we could halt no longer between two opinions who musteither fight or yield</s>  for herself she said she did not care sincealthough she was young and their ruler she set no store upon her lifeand would give it up gladly rather than be driven into a marriagewhich she considered shameful and forced to pass beneath the yoke oftraitors</s> but for us foreigners she did care</s>  we had come to her country at herinvitation we had served her nobly one of us had given his life toprotect her person and now in violation of her safeguard and that ofthe council we were threatened with a dreadful death</s>  were they hersubjects so lacking in honour and hospitality that they would suffersuch a thing with no blow struck to save us</s> now the majority of them shouted no but some were silent and one oldcaptain advanced saluted and spoke</s> child of kings he said let us search out the truth of this matter</s> is it not because of your love of the foreign soldier orme that allthis trouble has arisen</s>  is not that love unlawful according to our lawand are you not solemnly affianced to the prince joshua</s> maqueda considered awhile before she replied and said slowlyfriend my heart is my own therefore upon this point answer yourquestion for yourself</s>  as regards my uncle joshua if there existed anyabiding contract between us it was broken when a few nights ago he senthis servants armed to attack and drag me off i know not whither</s>  wouldyou have me marry a traitor and a coward</s>  i have spoken</s> no again shouted the majority of the soldiers</s> then in the silence that followed the old captain replied with acanniness that was almost scotchon the point raised by you o child of kings i give no opinion sinceyou being but a woman if a highborn one would not listen to me if idid but will doubtless follow that heart of yours of which you speak towhatever end is appointed</s>  settle the matter with your betrothed joshuaas you will</s>  but we also have a matter to settle with joshua who is atoad with a long tongue that if he seems slow yet never misses his fly</s> we took up your cause and have killed a great number of his people ashe has killed some of ours</s>  this he will not forget</s>  therefore it seemsto me that it will be wise that we should make what we can of the nestthat we have built since it is better to die in battle than on thegallows</s>  for this reason then since we can stay here no longer formy part i am willing to go out and fight for you this night althoughjoshuas people being so many and ours so few i shall think myselffortunate if i live to see another sun</s> this hard and reasoned speech seemed to appeal to the dissentients withthe result that they withdrew their opposition and it was agreed thatwe should attempt to break our way through the besieging army about onehour before the dawn when they would be heavily asleep and most liableto panic</s> yet as it chanced that sortie was destined never to take place whichperhaps was fortunate for us since i am convinced that it would haveended in failure</s>  it is true that we might have forced our way throughjoshuas army but afterwards those of us who remained alive would havebeen surrounded starved out and when our strength and ammunition wereexhausted taken prisoners or cut down</s> however that may be events shaped a different course for us perhapsbecause the abati got wind of our intention and had no stomach fora pitched battle with desperate men</s>  as it happened this night fromsunset on to moonrise was one of a darkness so remarkable that it wasimpossible to see anything even a foot away also a wind blowing fromthe east made sounds very inaudible</s>  only a few of our men were onguard since it was necessary that they should be rested till it wastime for them to prepare for their great effort</s>  also we had littlefear of any direct attack</s> about eight oclock however my son roderick one of the watchstationed in the gateway towers who was gifted with very quick earsreported that he thought he heard people moving on the farther side ofthe massive wooden doors beyond the moat</s>  accordingly some of us went tolisten but could distinguish nothing and concluded therefore that hewas mistaken</s>  so we retired to our posts and waited patiently for themoon to rise</s>  but as it chanced no moon rose or rather we could notsee her because the sky was completely covered by thick banks ofthunderclouds presaging the breakup of a period of great heat</s>  theseas the wind had now died down remained quite stationary upon the faceof the sky blotting out all light</s> perhaps another hour had passed when chancing to look behind me i sawwhat i thought was a meteor falling from the crest of the cliff againstwhich the palace was built that cliff whither the head of the idolharmac had been carried by the force of the explosion</s> look at that shooting star i said to oliver who was at my side</s> it is not a shooting star it is fire he replied in a startled voiceand as he spoke other streaks of light scores of them began to raindown from the brow of the cliff and land upon the wooden buildings tothe rear of the palace that were dry as tinder with the drought andwhat was worse upon the gilded timber domes of the roof</s> dont you understand the game</s>  he went on</s>  they have tied firebrandsto arrows and spears to burn us out</s>  sound the alarm</s>  sound the alarm</s> it was done and presently the great range of buildings began to humlike a hive of bees</s>  the soldiers still half asleep rushed hitherand thither shouting</s>  the officers also developing the characteristicexcitement of the abati race in this hour of panic yelled and screamedat them beating them with their fists and swords till some kind ofcontrol was established</s> then attempts were made to extinguish the flames which by this timehad got hold in halfadozen places</s>  from the beginning the effort wasabsolutely hopeless</s>  it is true that there was plenty of water in themoat which was fed by a perennial stream that flowed down the face ofthe precipice behind but pumping engines of any sort were quite unknownto the abati who if a building took fire just let it burn contentingthemselves with safeguarding those in its neighbourhood</s>  moreovereven in the palace such articles as pails jugs or other vessels werecomparatively few and far between</s> those that we could find however were filled with water and passedby lines of men to the places in most dangerthat is practicallyeverywherewhile other men tried to cut off the advance of the flamesby pulling down portions of the building</s> but as fast as one fire was extinguished others broke out for the rainof burning darts and of lighted pots or lamps filled with oil descendedcontinuously from the cliff above</s>  a strange and terrible sight it wasto see them flashing down through the darkness like the fiery dartsthat shall destroy the wicked in the day of armageddon</s> still we toiled on despairingly</s>  on the roof we four white men andsome soldiers under the command of japhet were pouring water on toseveral of the gilded domes which now were well alight</s>  close bywrapped in a dark cloak and attended by some of her ladies stoodmaqueda</s>  she was quite calm although sundry burning arrows and spearsfalling with great force from the cliff above struck the flat roofsclose to where she stood</s> her ladies however were not calm</s>  they wept and wrung their handswhile one of them went into violent hysterics in her very naturalterror</s>  maqueda turned and bade them descend to the courtyard of thegateway where she said she would join them presently</s>  they rushed offrejoicing to escape the sight of those burning arrows one of which hadjust pierced a man and set his clothes and hair on fire causing him toleap from the roof in his madness</s> at olivers request i ran to the child of kings to lead her to somesafer place if it could be found</s>  but she would not stir</s> let me be o adams she said</s>
 buti do not think that is fated and with her foot she kicked aside aburning spear that had struck the cement roof and rebounding fallenquite close to her</s>  if my people will not fight she went on withbitter sarcasm at least they understand the other arts of war forthis trick of theirs is clever</s>  they are cruel also</s>  listen to themmocking us in the square</s>  they ask whether we will roast alive or comeout and have our throats cut</s>  oh</s>  she went on clenching her handsoh</s>  that i should have been born the head of such an accursed race</s>  letsheol take them all for in the day of their tribulation no finger willi lift to save them</s> she was silent for a moment and down below near the gateway i heardsome brute screaming pretty pigeons</s>  pretty pigeons are your featherssingeing</s>  come then into our pie pretty pigeons pretty pigeons</s> followed by shouts of ribald laughter</s> but it chanced it was this hound himself who went into the pie</s> presently when the flames were brighter i saw him in the midst of acrowd of his admirers singing his foul song another verse of it aboutmaqueda which i will not repeat and by good fortune managed to put abullet through his head</s>  it was not a bad shot considering the light andcircumstances and the only one i fired that night</s>  i trust also that itwill be the last i shall ever fire at any human being</s> just as i was about to leave maqueda and return with her message toorme to the effect that she would not move the final catastropheoccurred</s>  amongst the stables was a large shed filled with dry fodderfor the palace horses and camels</s>  suddenly this burst into a mass offlame that spread in all directions</s>  then came the last hideous panic</s> from every part of the palace the mountaineers men and officerstogether rushed down to the gateway</s>  in a minute with the singleexception of japhet we four and maqueda were left alone upon theroof where we stood overwhelmed not knowing what to do</s>  we heardthe drawbridge fall we heard the great doors burst upon beneath thepressure of a mob of men we heard a coarse voicei thought it was thatof joshuayellkill whom you will my children but death to him who harms the childof kings</s>  she is my spoil</s> then followed terrible sights and sounds</s>  the cunning abati hadstretched ropes outside the doors it was the noise they made at thiswork which had reached rodericks ears earlier during the darkness</s>  theterrified soldiers flying from the fire stumbled and fell over theseropes nor could they rise again because of those who pressed behind</s> what happened to them all i am sure i do not know but doubtless manywere crushed to death and many more killed by joshuas men</s>  i trusthowever that some of them escaped since compared to the rest of theabati they were as lions are to cats although like all their racethey lacked the stamina to fight an uphill game</s> it was at the commencement of this terrific scene that i shot thefoulmouthed singer</s> you shouldnt have done that old fellow screamed higgs in his highvoice striving to make himself heard above the tumult as it will showthose swine where we are</s> i dont think they will look for us here anyway i answered</s> then we watched awhile in silence</s> come said orme at length taking maqueda by the hand</s> where are you going o oliver</s>  she asked hanging back</s>  sooner will iburn than yield to joshua</s> i am going to the cave city he answered we have nowhere else togo and little time to lose</s>  four men with rifles can hold that placeagainst a thousand</s>  come</s> i obey she answered bowing her head</s> we went down the stairway that led from the roof on which theinhabitants of the palace were accustomed to spend much of their dayand even to sleep in hot weather as is common in the east</s>  anotherminute and we should have been too late</s>  the fire from one of the domeshad spread to the upper story and was already appearing in littletongues of flame mingled with jets of black smoke through cracks in thecrumbling partition wall</s> as a matter of fact this wall fell in just as my son roderick the lastof us was passing down the stairs</s>  with the curiosity of youth he hadlingered for a few moments to watch the sad scene below a delay whichnearly cost him his life</s> on the ground floor we found ourselves out of immediate danger sincethe fire was attacking this part of the palace from above and burningdownward</s>  we had even time to go to our respective sleepingplaces andcollect such of our possessions and valuables as we were able to carry</s> fortunately among other things these included all our notebookswhich today are of priceless value</s>  laden with these articles we metagain in the audience hall which although it was very hot seemed asit had always been a huge empty place whereof the roof painted withstars was supported upon thick cedar columns each of them hewn from asingle tree</s> passing down that splendid apartment which an hour later had ceased toexist lamps in hand for these we had found time to fetch and lightwe reached the mouth of the passage that led to the underground citywithout meeting a single human being</s> had the abati been a different race they could perfectly well havedashed in and made us prisoners for the drawbridge was still intact</s> but their cowardice was our salvation for they feared lest they shouldbe trapped by the fire</s>  so i think at least but justice compels me toadd that on the spur of the moment they may have found it impossibleto clear the gateways of the mass of fallen or dead soldiers over whichit would have been difficult to climb</s> such at any rate was the explanation that we heard afterwards</s> we reached the mouth of the vast cave in perfect safety and clamberedthrough the little orifice which was left between the rocks rolledthither by the force of the explosion or shaken down from the roof</s> this hole for it was nothing more we proceeded to stop with a fewstones in such a fashion that it could not be forced without much toiland considerable noise only leaving one little tortuous channel throughwhich if necessary a man could creep</s> the labour of rockcarrying in which even maqueda shared occupied ourminds for awhile and induced a kind of fictitious cheerfulness</s>  butwhen it was done and the chilly silence of that enormous cave sostriking in comparison with the roar of the flames and the hideous humantumult which we had left without fell upon us like sudden cold andblinding night upon a wanderer in windy sunlit mountains all ourexcitement perished</s>  in a flash we understood our terrible positionwe who had but escaped from the red fire to perish slowly in the blackdarkness</s> still we strove to keep our spirits as best we could</s>  leaving higgs towatch the blocked passage a somewhat superfluous task since the firewithout was our best watchman the rest of us threaded our way up thecave following the telephone wire which poor quick had laid on thenight of the blowingup of the god harmac till we came to what had beenour headquarters during the digging of the mine</s>  into the room whichwas olivers whence we had escaped with so much difficulty afterthat event we could not enter because of the transom that blocked thedoorway</s>  still there were plenty of others at hand in the old templealthough they were foul with the refuse of the bats that wheeled aboutus in thousands for these creatures evidently had some unknown accessto the open air</s>  one of these rooms had served as our storechamber andafter a few rough preparations we assigned it to maqueda</s> friends she said as she surveyed its darksome entrance it lookslike the door of a tomb</s>  well in the tomb there is rest and rest imust have</s>  leave me to sleep who were it not for you o oliver wouldpray that i might never wake again</s> man she added passionately before us all for now in face of thelast peril every false shame and wish to conceal the truth had left herman why were you born to bring woe upon my head and joy to my heart</s> well well the joy outweighs the woe and even if the angel who led youhither is named azrael still i shall bless him who has revealed to memy soul</s>  yet for you i weep and if only your life could be spared tofulfil itself in happiness in the land that bore you oh</s>  for you iwould gladly die</s> now oliver who seemed deeply moved stepped to her and began to whisperinto her ear evidently making some proposal of which i think i canguess the nature</s>  she listened to him smiling sadly and made a motionwith her hand as though to thrust him away</s> not so she said it is nobly offered but did i accept throughwhatever universes i may wander those who came after me would know meby my trail of blood the blood of him who loved me</s>  perhaps too bythat crime i should be separated from you for ever</s>  moreover i tellyou that though all seems black as this thick darkness i believe thatthings will yet end well for you and mein this world or another</s> then she was gone leaving orme staring after her like a man in atrance</s> i daresay they will remarked higgs sotto voce to me and thatsfirstrate so far as they are concerned</s>  but what i should jolly welllike to know is how they are going to end for us who havent got acharming lady to see us across the styx</s> you neednt puzzle your brain over that i answered gloomily fori think there will soon be a few more skeletons in this beastly cavethats all</s>  dont you see that those abati will believe we are burned inthe palace</s> chapter xixstarvationi was right</s>  the abati did think that we had been burned</s>  it neveroccurred to them that we might have escaped to the underground city</s> so at least i judged from the fact that they made no attempt to seekus there until they learned the truth in the fashion that i am about todescribe</s>  if anything this safety from our enemies added to the trialsof those hideous days and nights</s>  had there been assaults to repel andthe excitement of striving against overwhelming odds at any rate weshould have found occupation for our minds and remaining energies</s> but there were none</s>  by turns we listened at the mouth of the passagefor the echo of footsteps that never came</s>  nothing came to break asilence so intense that at last our ears craving for sound magnifiedthe soft flitter of the bats into a noise as of eagles wings tillat last we spoke in whispers because the full voice of man seemed toaffront the solemn quietude seemed intolerable to our nerves</s> yet for the first day or two we found occupation of a sort</s>  of courseour first need was to secure a supply of food of which we had only alittle originally laid up for our use in the chambers of the old templetinned meats that we had brought from london and so forth now nearlyall consumed</s>  we remembered that maqueda had told us of corn fromher estates which was stored annually in pits to provide against thepossibility of a siege of mur and asked her where it was</s> she led us to a place where round stone covers with rings attached tothem were let into the floor of the cave not unlike those which stopthe coalshoots in a town pavement only larger</s>  with great difficultywe prised one of these up to me it did not seem to have been movedsince the ancient kings ruled in mur and after leaving it open for along while for the air within to purify lowered roderick by a rope wehad to report its contents</s>  next moment we heard him saying want tocome up please</s>  this place is not pleasant</s> we pulled him out and asked what he had found</s> nothing good to eat he answered only plenty of dead bones and onerat that ran up my leg</s> we tried the next two pits with the same resultthey were full of humanbones</s>  then we crossexamined maqueda who after reflection informedus that she now remembered that about five generations before a greatplague had fallen on mur which reduced its population by onehalf</s>  shehad heard also that those stricken with the plague were driven intothe underground city in order that they might not infect the othersand supposed that the bones we saw were their remains</s>  this informationcaused us to close up those pits again in a great hurry though reallyit did not matter whether we caught the plague or no</s> still as she was sure that corn was buried somewhere we went toanother group of pits in a distant chamber and opened the first one</s> this time our search was rewarded to the extent that we found at thebottom of it some mouldering dust that years ago had been grain</s>  theother pits two of which had been sealed up within three years as thedate upon the wax showed were quite empty</s> then maqueda understood what had happened</s> surely the abati are a people of rogues she said</s>  see now theofficers appointed to store away my corn which i gave them have stolenit</s>  oh</s>  may they live to lack bread even more bitterly than we dotoday</s> we went back to our sleepingplace in silence</s>  well might we be silentfor of food we had only enough left for a single scanty meal</s>  waterthere was in plenty but no food</s>  when we had recovered a little fromour horrible disappointment we consulted together</s> if we could get through the mine tunnel said oliver we mightescape into the den of lions which were probably all destroyed by theexplosion and so out into the open country</s> the fung would take us there suggested higgs</s> no no broke in roderick fung all gone or if they do anythingbetter than this black hole yes even my wife</s> let us look i said and we started</s> when we reached the passage that led from the city to the tomb of kingsit was to find that the wall at the end of it had been blown bodily backinto the parent cave leaving an opening through which we could walkside by side</s>  of course the contents of the tomb itself were scattered</s> in all directions lay bones objects of gold and other metals oroverturned thrones</s>  the roof and walls alone remained as they had been</s> what vandalism</s>  exclaimed higgs indignant even in his misery</s>  whywouldnt you let me move the things when i wanted to orme</s> because they would have thought that we were stealing them old fellow</s> also those mountaineers were superstitious and i did not want them todesert</s>  but what does it matter anyway</s>  if you had they would havebeen burned in the palace</s> by this time we had reached that end of the vast tomb where thehunchbacked king used to sit and saw at once that our quest was vain</s> the tunnel which we had dug beyond was utterly choked with masses offallen rock that we could never hope to move even with the aid ofexplosives of which we had none left</s> so we returned our last hope gone</s> also another trouble stared us in the face our supply of the crudemineral oil which the abati used for lighting purposes was beginning torun low</s>  measurement of what remained of the store laid up for our usewhile the mine was being made revealed the fact that there was onlyenough left to supply four lamps for about three days and nights onefor maqueda one for ourselves one for the watchman near the tunnelmouth and one for general purposes</s> this generalpurpose lamp as a matter of fact was mostly made use ofby higgs</s>  truly he furnished a striking instance of the ruling passionstrong in death</s>  all through those days of starvation and utter miseryuntil he grew too weak and the oil gave out he trudged backward andforward between the old temple and the tomb of kings carrying a largebasket on his arm</s>  going out with this basket empty he would bringit back filled with gold cups and other precious objects that he hadcollected from among the bones and scattered rubbish in the tomb</s>  theseobjects he laboriously catalogued in his pocketbook at night andafterwards packed away in empty cases that had contained our supplies ofexplosive and other goods carefully nailing them down when filled</s> what on earth are you doing that for higgs</s>  i asked petulantly as hefinished off another case i think it was his twentieth</s> i dont know doctor he answered in a thin voice for like the restof us he was growing feeble on a waterdiet</s>  i suppose it amuses meto think how jolly it would be to open all these boxes in my rooms inlondon after a firstrate dinner of fried sole and steak cut thick andhe smacked his poor hungry lips</s>  yes yes he went on to take themout one by one and show them to  and  and he mentioned by nameofficials of sundry great museums with whom he was at war and see themtear their hair with rage and jealousy while they wondered in theirhearts if they could not manage to seize the lot for the crown astreasuretrove or do me out of them somehow and he laughed a littlein his old pleasant fashion</s> of course i never shall he added sadly but perhaps one day someother fellow will find them here and get them to europe and if he isa decent chap publish my notes and descriptions of which i have puta duplicate in each box and so make my name immortal</s>  well im offagain</s>  there are four more cases to fill before the oil gives out andi must get that great gold head into one of them though it is an awfuljob to carry it far at a time</s>  doctor what disease is it that makesyour legs suddenly give way beneath you so that you find yourselfsitting in a heap on the floor without knowing how you came there</s>  youdont know</s>  well no more do i but ive got it bad</s>  i tell you imdownright sore behind from continual and unexpected contact with therock</s> poor old higgs</s>  i did not like to tell him that his disease wasstarvation</s> well he went on with his fetching and carrying and cataloguing andpacking</s>  i remember that the last load he brought in was the golden headhe had spoken of the wonderful likeness of some prehistoric king whichhas since excited so much interest throughout the world</s>  the thing beingtoo heavy for him to carry in his weakened state for it is much overlifesize he was obliged to roll it before him which accounts for thepresent somewhat damaged condition of the nose and semiegyptian diadem</s> never shall i forget the sight of the professor as he appeared out ofthe darkness shuffling along upon his knees where his garments wereworn into holes and by the feeble light of the lamp that he moved fromtime to time painfully pushing the great yellow object forward only afoot or two at each push</s> here it is at last he gasped triumphantly whilst we watched him withindifferent eyes</s>  japhet help me to wrap it up in the mat and liftit into the box</s>  no no you donkeyface upwardso</s>  never mind thecorners ill fill them with ringmoney and other trifles and out ofhis wide pockets he emptied a golden shower amongst which he siftedhandfuls of dust from the floor and anything else he could find to serveas packing finally covering all with a goatshair blanket which hetook from his bed</s> then very slowly he found the lid of the box and nailed it down restingbetween every few strokes of the hammer whilst we watched him in ourintent but idle fashion wondering at the strange form of his madness</s> at length the last nail was driven and seated on the box he put hishand into an inner pocket to find his notebook then incontinentlyfainted</s>  i struggled to my feet and sprinkled water over his face tillhe revived and rolled on to the floor where presently he sank intosleep or torpor</s>  as he did so the first lamp gave out</s> light it japhet said maqueda it is dark in this place</s> o child of kings answered the man i would obey if i could butthere is no more oil</s> halfanhour later the second lamp went out</s>  by the light that remainedwe made such arrangements as we could knowing that soon darkness wouldbe on us</s>  they were few and simple the fetching of a jar or twoof water the placing of arms and ammunition to our hands and thespreading out of some blankets on which to lie down side by side uponwhat i for one believed would be our bed of death</s> while we were thus engaged japhet crawled into our circle from theouter gloom</s>  suddenly i saw his haggard face appear looking like thatof a spirit rising from the grave</s> my lamp is burned out he moaned it began to fail whilst i wason watch at the tunnel mouth and before i was halfway here it diedaltogether</s>  had it not been for the wire of the thingthatspeakswhich guided me i could never have reached you</s>  i should have been lostin the darkness of the city and perished alone among the ghosts</s> well you are here now said oliver</s>  have you anything to report</s> nothing lord or at least very little</s>  i moved some of the small rocksthat we piled up and crept down the hole till i came to a place wherethe blessed light of day fell upon me only one little ray of it butstill the light of day</s>  i think that something has fallen upon thetunnel and broken it perhaps one of the outer walls of the palace</s> at least i looked through a crack and saw everywhere ruinsruins thatstill smoke</s>  from among them i heard the voices of men shouting to eachother</s> one of them called to his companion that it was strange if thegentiles and the child of kings had perished in the fire that they hadnot found their bones which would be known by the guns they carried</s>  hisfriend answered that it was strange indeed but being magicians perhapsthey had hidden away somewhere</s>  for his part he hoped so as then sooneror later they would be found and put to death slowly as they deservedwho had led astray the child of kings and brought so many of theheavendescended abati to their death</s>  then fearing lest they shouldfind and kill me for they drew near as i could tell by their voices icrept back again and that is all my story</s> we said nothing there seemed to be nothing to say but sat in our sadcircle and watched the dying lamp</s>  when it began to flicker leaping upand down like a thing alive a sudden panic seized poor japhet</s> o walda nagasta he cried throwing himself at her feet you havecalled me a brave man but i am only brave where the sun and the starsshine</s>  here in the dark amongst so many angry spirits and with hungergnawing at my bowels i am a great coward joshua himself is not such acoward as i</s>  let us go out into the light while there is yet time</s>  letus give ourselves up to the prince</s>  perhaps he will be merciful andspare our lives or at least he will spare yours and if we die it willbe with the sun shining on us</s> but maqueda only shook her head whereon he turned to orme and went onlord would you have the blood of the child of kings upon your hands</s> is it thus that you repay her for her love</s>  lead her forth</s>  no harm willcome to her who otherwise must perish here in misery</s> you hear what the man says maqueda</s>  said orme heavily</s>  there is sometruth in it</s>  it really does not matter to us whether we die in the powerof the abati or here of starvation in fact i think that we shouldprefer the former end and doubtless no hand will be laid on you</s>  willyou go</s> nay she answered passionately</s>  a hand would be laid on me the handof joshua and rather than that he should touch me i will die a hundreddeaths</s>  let fate take its course for as i have told you i believe thatthen it will open to us some gate we cannot see</s>  and if i believe invain why there is another gate which we can pass together o oliverand beyond that gate lies peace</s>  bid the man be silent or drive himaway</s>  let him trouble me no more</s>
 it flickered once twice thrice each timeshowing the pale drawn faces of us six seated about it like wizardsmaking an incantation like corpses in a tomb</s> then it went out</s> how long were we in that place after this</s>  at least three whole days andnights i believe if not more but of course we soon lost all count oftime</s>  at first we suffered agonies from famine which we strove in vainto assuage with great draughts of water</s>  no doubt these kept us alivebut even higgs who it may be remembered was a teetotaller afterwardsconfessed to me that he has loathed the sight and taste of water eversince</s>  indeed he now drinks beer and wine like other people</s>  it wastorture we could have eaten anything</s>  in fact the professor did manageto catch and eat a bat that got entangled in his red hair</s>  he offered mea bite of it i remember and was most grateful when i declined</s> the worst of it was also that we had a little food a few hard shipsbiscuits which we had saved up for a purpose namely to feed maqueda</s> this was how we managed it</s>  at certain intervals i would announce thatit was time to eat and hand maqueda her biscuit</s>  then we would allpretend to eat also saying how much we felt refreshed by the food andhow we longed for more smacking our lips and biting on a piece of woodso that she could not help hearing us</s> this piteous farce went on for fortyeight hours or more until atlast the wretched japhet who was quite demoralized and in no mood foracting betrayed us exactly how i cannot remember</s>  after this maquedawould touch nothing more which did not greatly matter as there was onlyone biscuit left</s>  i offered it to her whereon she thanked me and allof us for our courtesy toward a woman took the biscuit and gave it tojaphet who ate it like a wolf</s> it was some time after this incident that we discovered japhet to bemissing at least we could no longer touch him nor did he answer whenwe called</s>  therefore we concluded that he had crept away to die andi am sorry to say thought little more about it for after all what hesuffered or had suffered we suffered also</s> i recall that before we were overtaken by the last sleep a strangefit came upon us</s>  our pangs passed away much as the pain does whenmortification follows a wound and with them that horrible craving fornutriment</s>  we grew cheerful and talked a great deal</s>  thus roderick gaveme the entire history of the fung people and of his life among them andother savage tribes</s>  further he explained every secret detail of theiridol worship to higgs who was enormously interested and tried tomake some notes by the aid of our few remaining matches</s>  when even thatsubject was exhausted he sang to us in his beautiful voiceenglishhymns and arab songs</s>  oliver and maqueda also chatted together quitegaily for i heard them laughing and gathered that he was engaged intrying to teach her english</s> the last thing that i recollect is the scene as it was revealed by themomentary light of one of the last matches</s>  maqueda sat by oliver</s>  hisarm was about her waist her head rested upon his shoulder her longhair flowed loose her large and tender eyes stared from her white wanface up toward his face which was almost that of a mummy</s> then on the other side stood my son supporting himself against the wallof the room and beyond him higgs a shadow of his former self feeblywaving a pencil in the air and trying apparently to write a note uponhis panama straw hat which he held in his left hand as i supposeimagining it to be his pocketbook</s>  the incongruity of that sunhat ina place where no sun had ever come made me laugh and as the match wentout i regretted that i had forgotten to look at his face to ascertainwhether he was still wearing his smoked spectacles</s> what is the use of a straw hat and smoked spectacles in kingdomcome</s> i kept repeating to myself while roderick whose arm i knew was aboutme seemed to answerthe fung wizards say that the sphinx harmac once wore a hat but myfather i do not know if he had spectacles</s> then a sensation as of being whirled round and round in some vastmachine down the sloping sides of which i sank at last into a vortex ofutter blackness whereof i knew the name was death</s> dimly very dimly i became aware that i was being carried</s>  i heardvoices in my ears but what they said i could not understand</s>  then afeeling of light struck upon my eyeballs which gave me great pain</s>  agonyran all through me as it does through the limbs of one who is beingbrought back from death by drowning</s>  after this something warm waspoured down my throat and i went to sleep</s> when i awoke again it was to find myself in a large room that i did notknow</s>  i was lying on a bed and by the light of sunrise which streamedthrough the windowplaces i saw the three others my son roderick ormeand higgs lying on the other beds but they were still asleep</s> abati servants entered the room bringing food a kind of rough soup withpieces of meat in it of which they gave me a portion in a wooden bowlthat i devoured greedily</s>  also they shook my companions until they awokeand almost automatically ate up the contents of similar bowls afterwhich they went to sleep again as i did thanking heaven that we wereall still alive</s> every few hours i had a vision of these men entering with the bowlsof soup or porridge until at last life and reason came back to me inearnest and i saw higgs sitting up on the bed opposite and staring atme</s> i say old fellow he said are we alive or is this hades</s> cant be hades i answered because there are abati here</s> quite right he replied</s>  if the abati go anywhere its to hellwhere they havent whitewashed walls and fourpost beds</s>  oliver wakeup</s>  we are out of that cave anyway</s> orme raised himself on his hand and stared at us</s> wheres maqueda</s>  he asked a question to which of course we couldgive no answer till presently roderick woke also and saidi remember something</s>  they carried us all out of the cave japhet waswith them</s>  they took the child of kings one way and us another that isall i know</s> shortly afterwards the abati servants arrived bearing food more solidthan the soup and with them came one of their doctors not that oldidiot of a court physician who examined us and announced thatwe should all recover a fact which we knew already</s>  we asked manyquestions of him and the servants but could get no answer forevidently they were sworn to silence</s>  however we persuaded them tobring us water to wash in</s>  it came and with it a polished piece ofmetal such as the abati use for a lookingglass in which we saw ourfaces the terrible wasted faces of those who have gone within a hairsbreadth of death by starvation in the dark</s> yet although our gaolers would say nothing something in their aspecttold us that we were in sore peril of our lives</s>  they looked at ushungrily as a terrier looks at rats in a wire cage of which the doorwill presently be opened</s>  moreover roderick who as i think i havesaid has very quick ears overheard one of the attendants whisper toanotherwhen does our service on these hounds of gentiles come to an end</s>  towhich his fellow answered the council has not yet decided but i thinktomorrow or the next day if they are strong enough</s>  it will be a greatshow</s> also that evening about sunset we heard a mob shouting outside thebarrack in which we were imprisoned for that was its real use give usthe gentiles</s>  give us the gentiles</s>  we are tired of waiting until atlength some soldiers drove them away</s> well we talked the thing over only to conclude that there was nothingto be done</s>  we had no friend in the place except maqueda and sheit appeared was a prisoner like ourselves and therefore could notcommunicate with us</s>  nor could we see the slightest possibility ofescape</s> out of the fryingpan into the fire remarked higgs gloomily</s>  i wishnow that they had let us die in the cave</s>  it would have been better thanbeing baited to death by a mob of abati</s>
yes answered oliver with a sigh for he was thinking of maqueda butthats why they saved us the vindictive beasts to kill us for whatthey are pleased to call high treason</s> high treason</s>
 exclaimed higgs</s>  i hope to goodness their punishmentfor the offence is not that of medival england hanging is badenoughbut the rest</s> i dont think the abati study european history i broke in but itis no use disguising from you that they have methods of their own</s>  lookhere friends i added i have kept something about me in casethe worst should come to the worst and i produced a little bottlecontaining a particularly swift and deadly poison done up into tabloidsand gave one to each of them</s>  my advice is i added that if you seewe are going to be exposed to torture or to any dreadful form of deathyou should take one of these as i mean to do and cheat the abati oftheir vengeance</s> that is all very fine said the professor as he pocketed his tabloidbut i never could swallow a pill without water at the best of timesand i dont believe those beasts will give one any</s>  well i suppose imust suck it thats all</s>  oh</s>  if only the luck would turn if only theluck would turn</s> three more days went by without any sign of higgss aspiration beingfulfilled</s>  on the contrary except in one respect the luck remainedsteadily against us</s>  the exception was that we got plenty to eat andconsequently regained our normal state of health and strength morerapidly than might have been expected</s>  with us it was literally a caseof let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die</s> only somehow i dont think that any of us really believed that we shoulddie though whether this was because we had all except poor quicksurvived so much or from a sneaking faith in maquedas optimisticdreams i cannot say</s>  at any rate we ate our food with appetite tookexercise in an inner yard of the prison and strove to grow as strong aswe could feeling that soon we might need all our powers</s>  oliver was themost miserable among us not for his own sake but because poor fellowhe was haunted with fears as to maqueda and her fate although of thesehe said little or nothing to us</s>  on the other hand my son roderick wasby far the most cheerful</s>  he had lived for so many years upon the brinkof death that this familiar gulf seemed to have no terrors for him</s> all come right somehow my father he said airily</s>  who can know whathappen</s>  perhaps child of king drag us out of mudhole for after allshe was very strong cow or what you call it heifer and i think tossjoshua if he drive her into corner</s>  or perhaps other thing occur</s> what other thing roderick</s>  i asked</s> oh</s>  dont know cant say but i think fung thing</s>  believe we not donewith fung yet believe they not run far</s>  believe they take thought formorrow and come back again</s>  only he added sadly hope my wife notcome back for that old girl too full of lofty temper for me</s>  stillcheer up not dead yet by long days march and meanwhile food goodand this very jolly rest after beastly underground city</s>  now i tellprofessor some more stories about fung religion den of lions and soforth</s> on the morning after this conversation a crisis came</s>  just as we hadfinished breakfast the doors of our chamber were thrown open and inmarched a number of soldiers wearing joshuas badge</s>  they were headed byan officer of his household who commanded us to rise and follow him</s> where to</s>  asked orme</s> to take your trial before the child of kings and her council gentileupon the charge of having murdered certain of her subjects answeredthe officer sternly</s> thats all right said higgs with a sigh of relief</s>  if maqueda ischairman of the bench we are pretty certain of an acquittal for ormessake if not for our own</s> dont you be too sure of that i whispered into his ear</s>  thecircumstances are peculiar and women have been known to change theirminds</s> adams he replied glaring at me through his smoked spectacles ifyou talk like that we shall quarrel</s>  maqueda change her mind indeed</s> why it is an insult to suggest such a thing and if you take my adviceyou wont let oliver hear you</s>  dont you remember man that shes inlove with him</s> oh yes i answered but i remember also that prince joshua is inlove with her and that she is his prisoner</s> chapter xxthe trial and afterthey set us in a line four raggedlooking fellows all of us withbeards of various degrees of growth that is all the other three formine had been an established fact for years and everything having beentaken away from us we possessed neither razor nor scissors</s> in the courtyard of our barrack we were met by a company of soldierswho encircled us about with a triple line of men as we thought toprevent any attempt of escape</s>  so soon as we passed the gates i foundhowever that this was done for a different reason namely to protectus from the fury of the populace</s>  all the way from the barrack to thecourthouse whither we were being taken now that the palace was burnedthe people were gathered in hundreds literally howling for our blood</s> it was a strange and in a way a dreadful sight to see even thebrightly dressed women and children shaking their fists and spitting atus with faces distorted by hate</s> why they love you so little father when you do so much for them</s> asked roderick shrugging his shoulders and dodging a stone that nearlyhit him on the head</s> for two reasons i answered</s>  because their lady loves one of us toomuch and because through us many of their people have lost their lives</s> also they hate strangers and are by nature cruel like most cowardsand now that they have no more fear of the fung they think it will besafe to kill us</s> ah</s>  said roderick yet harmac has come to mur and he pointed to thegreat head of the idol seated on the cliff and i think where harmacgoes fung follow and if so they make them pay plenty for my life fori great man among fung fung myself husband of sultans daughter</s>  thesefools like children because they see no fung think there are no fung</s> well in one year or perhaps one month they learn</s> i daresay my boy i answered but i am afraid that wont help us</s> by now we were approaching the courthouse where the abati priests andlearned men tried civil and some criminal cases</s>  through a mob of noblesand soldiers who mocked us as we went we were hustled into the largehall of judgment that was already full to overflowing</s> up the centre of it we marched to a clear space reserved for the partiesto a cause or prisoners and their advocates beyond which against thewall were seats for the judges</s>  these were five members of the councilone of whom was joshua while in the centre as president of the courtand wearing her veil and beautiful robes of ceremony sat maquedaherself</s> thank god shes safe</s>  muttered oliver with a gasp of relief</s> yes answered higgs but whats she doing there</s>  she ought to be inthe dock too not on the bench</s> we reached the open space and were thrust by soldiers armed with swordsto where we must stand and although each of us bowed to her i observedthat maqueda took not the slightest notice of our salutations</s>  she onlyturned her head and said something to joshua on her right which causedhim to laugh</s> then with startling suddenness the case began</s>  a kind of publicprosecutor stood forward and droned out the charge against us</s>  it wasthat we who were in the employ of the abati had traitorously takenadvantage of our position as mercenary captains to stir up a civilwar in which many people had lost their lives and some been actuallymurdered by ourselves and our companion who was dead</s>  moreover thatwe had caused their palace to be burned and greatest crime of all hadseized the sacred person of the walda nagasta rose of mur and draggedher away into the recesses of the underground city whence she was onlyrescued by the chance of an accomplice of ours one japhet betrayingour hidingplace</s> this was the charge which it will be noted contained no allusionwhatever to the love entanglement between maqueda and oliver</s>  when itwas finished the prosecutor asked us what we pleaded whereon oliveranswered as our spokesman that it was true there had been fighting andmen killed also that we had been driven into the cave but as to allthe rest the child of kings knew the truth and must speak for us as shewished</s> now the audience began to shout they plead guilty</s>  give them todeath</s>  and so forth while the judges rising from their seats gatheredround maqueda and consulted her</s> by heaven</s>  i believe she is going to give us away</s>  exclaimed higgswhereon oliver turned on him fiercely and bade him hold his tongueaddingif you were anywhere else you should answer for that slander</s> at length the consultation was finished the judges resumed their seatsand maqueda held up her hand</s>  thereon an intense silence fell upon theplace</s>  then she began to speak in a cold constrained voicegentiles she said addressing us you have pleaded guilty to thestirring up of civil war in mur and to the slaying of numbers of itspeople facts of which there is no need for evidence since many widowsand fatherless children can testify to them today</s>  moreover you didas alleged by my officer commit the crime of bearing off my person intothe cave and keeping me there by force to be a hostage for your safety</s> we heard and gasped higgs ejaculating good gracious what a lie</s>  butnone of the rest of us said anything</s> for these offences went on maqueda you are all of you justly worthyof a cruel death</s>  then she paused and added yet as i have the powerto do i remit the sentence</s>  i decree that this day you and all thegoods that remain to you which have been found in the cave city andelsewhere together with camels for yourselves and your baggage shallbe driven from mur and that if any one of you returns hither he shallwithout further trial be handed over to the executioners</s>  this i dobecause at the beginning of your service a certain bargain was made withyou and although you have sinned so deeply i will not suffer thatthe glorious honour of the abati people shall be tarnished even by thebreath of suspicion</s>  get you gone wanderers and let us see your facesno more for ever</s> now the mob gathered in the hall shouted in exultation though i heardsome crying out no kill them</s>  kill them</s> when the tumult had died down maqueda spoke again sayingo noble and generous abati you approve of this deed of mercy you whowould not be held merciless in far lands o abati where although youmay not have heard of them there are i believe other peoples whothink themselves as great as you</s>  you would not have it whispered isay that we who are the best of the world we the children of solomonhave dealt harshly even with stray dogs that have wandered to our gates</s> moreover we called these dogs to hunt a certain beast for us thelionheaded beast called fung and to be just to them they huntedwell</s>  therefore spare them the noose though they may have deserved itand let them run hence with their bone say you the bone which theythink that they have earned</s>  what does a bone more or less matter to therich abati if only their holy ground is not defiled with the blood ofgentile dogs</s> nothing at all</s>  nothing at all</s>  they shouted</s>  tie it to their tailsand let them go</s> it shall be done o my people</s>  and now that we have finished with thesedogs i have another word to say to you</s>  you may have thought or heardthat i was too fond of them and especially of one of them and sheglanced toward oliver</s>  well there are certain dogs who will not workunless you pat them on the head</s>  therefore i patted this one on thehead since after all he is a clever dog who knows things that we donot know for instance how to destroy the idol of the fung</s>  o greatabati can any of you really have believed that i of the ancient raceof solomon and sheba i the child of kings purposed to give my noblehand to a vagrant gentile come hither for hire</s>  can you really havebelieved that i the solemnly betrothed to yonder prince of princesjoshua my uncle would for a moment even in my heart have preferred tohim such a man as that</s>  and once again she looked at oliver who madea wild motion as though he were about to speak</s>  but before he could somuch as open his lips maqueda went onwell if you believed not guessing all the while i was working for thesafety of my people soon shall you be undeceived since tomorrow nighti invite you to the great ceremony of my nuptials when according tothe ancient custom i break the glass with him whom on the followingnight i take to be my husband and rising she bowed thrice to theaudience then stretched out her hand to joshua</s> he too rose puffing himself out like a great turkeycock and takingher hand kissed it gobbling some words which we did not catch</s> wild cheering followed and in the momentary silence which followedoliver spoke</s> lady he said in a cold and bitter voice we gentiles have heardyour words</s>  we thank you for your kind acknowledgment of our servicesnamely the destruction of the idol of the fung at the cost of somerisk and labour to ourselves</s>  we thank you also for your generosity inallowing us as the reward of that service to depart from mur withinsult and hard words and such goods as remain to us instead ofconsigning us to death by torture as you and your council have thepower to do</s>  it is indeed a proof of your generosity and of that of theabati people which we shall always remember and repeat in our own landshould we live to reach it</s>  also we trust that it will come to theears of the savage fung so that at length they may understand thattrue nobility and greatness lie not in brutal deeds of arms but in thehearts of men</s>  but now walda nagasta i have a last request to make ofyou namely that i may see your face once more to be sure that it isyou who have spoken to us and not another beneath your veil and thatif this be so i may carry away with me a faithful picture of one sotrue to her country and noble to her guests as you have shown yourselfthis day</s> she listened then very slowly lifted her veil revealing such acountenance as i had never seen before</s>  it was maqueda without a doubtbut maqueda changed</s>  her face was pale which was only to be expectedafter all she had gone through her eyes glowed in it like coals herlips were set</s>  but it was her expression at once defiant and agonizedwhich impressed me so much that i never shall forget it</s>  i confess icould not read it in the least but it left upon my mind the belief thatshe was a false woman and yet ashamed of her own falsity</s>  there was thegreatest triumph of her art that in those terrible circumstances sheshould still have succeeded in conveying to me and to the hundreds ofothers who watched this conviction of her own turpitude</s> for a moment her eyes met those of orme but although he searchedthem with pleading and despair in his glance i could trace in hers norelenting sign but only challenge not unmixed with mockery</s>  then witha short hard laugh she let fall her veil again and turned to talk withjoshua</s>  oliver stood silent a little while long enough for higgs towhisper to mei say isnt this downright awful</s>  id rather be back in the den oflions than live to see it</s> as he spoke i saw oliver put his hand to where his revolver usuallyhung but of course it had been taken from him</s>  next he began tosearch in his pocket and finding that tabloid of poison which i hadgiven him lifted it toward his mouth</s>  but just as it touched his lipsmy son who was next to him saw also</s>  with a quick motion he struck itfrom his fingers and ground it to powder on the floor beneath his heel</s> oliver raised his arm as though to hit him then without a sound fellsenseless</s>  evidently maqueda noted all this also for i saw a kind ofquiver go through her and her hands gripped the arms of her chair tillthe knuckles showed white beneath the skin</s>  but she only saidthis gentile has fainted because he is disappointed with his reward</s> take him hence and let his companion the doctor adams attend to him</s> when he is recovered conduct them all from mur as i have decreed</s>  seethat they go unharmed taking with them plenty of food lest it be saidthat we only spared their lives here in order that they might starvewithout our gates</s> then waving her hand to show that the matter was done with she roseand followed by the judges and officers left the court by some doorbehind them</s> while she spoke a strong body of guards had surrounded us some of whomcame forward and lifted the senseless oliver on to a stretcher</s>  theycarried him down the court the rest of us following</s> look jeered the abati as he passed look at the gentile pig whothought to wear the bud of the rose upon his bosom</s>  he has got the thornnow not the rose</s>  is the swine dead think you</s> thus they mocked him and us</s> we reached our prison in safety and there i set to work to reviveoliver a task in which i succeeded at length</s>  when he had come tohimself again he drank a cup of water and said quite quietlyyou fellows have seen all so there is no need for talk andexplanations</s>  one thing i beg of you if you are any friends of mineand it is that you will not reproach or even speak of maqueda to me</s> doubtless she had reasons for what she did moreover her bringing uphas not been the same as ours and her code is different</s>  do not let usjudge her</s>  i have been a great fool that is all and now i am payingfor my folly or rather i have paid</s>  come let us have some dinnerfor we dont know when we shall get another meal</s> we listened to this speech in silence only i saw roderick turn aside tohide a smile and wondered why he smiled</s> scarcely had we finished eating or pretending to eat when an officerentered the room and informed us roughly that it was time for us tobe going</s>  as he did so some attendants who had followed him threw usbundles of clothes and with them four very beautiful camelhair cloaksto protect us from the cold</s>  with some of these garments we replaced ourrags for they were little more tying them and the rest of the outfitup into bundles</s> then clothed as abati of the upper class we were taken to the gatesof the barrack where we found a long train of riding camels waiting forus</s>  the moment that i saw these beasts i knew that they were the bestin the whole land and of very great value</s>  indeed that to which oliverwas conducted was maquedas own favourite dromedary which upon stateoccasions she sometimes rode instead of a horse</s>  he recognized it atonce poor fellow and coloured to the eyes at this unexpected mark ofkindness the only one she had vouchsafed to him</s> come gentiles said the officer and take count of your goods thatyou may not say that we have stolen anything from you</s>  here are yourfirearms and all the ammunition that is left</s>  these will be given to youat the foot of the pass but not before lest you should do more murderon the road</s>  on those camels are fastened the boxes in which you broughtup the magic fire</s>  we found them in your quarters in the cave cityready packed but what they contain we neither know nor care</s>  full orempty take them they are yours</s>  those and he pointed to two otherbeasts are laden with your pay which the child of kings sends to yourequesting that you will not count it till you reach egypt or your ownland since she wishes no quarrelling with you as to the amount</s>  therest carry food for you to eat also there are two spare beasts</s>  nowmount and begone</s> so we climbed into the embroidered saddles of the kneeling dromedariesand a few minutes later were riding through mur toward the passaccompanied by our guard and hooting mobs that once or twice becamethreatening but were driven off by the soldiers</s> i say doctor said higgs to me excitedly do you know that wehave got all the best of the treasure of the tomb of kings in thosefiveandtwenty crates</s>  i have thought since that i was crazy when ipacked them picking out the most valuable and rare articles with suchcare and filling in the cracks with ring money and small curiositiesbut now i see it was the inspiration of genius</s>  my subliminal self knewwhat was going to happen and was on the job thats all</s>  oh if onlywe can get it safe away i shall not have played daniel and been nearlystarved to death for nothing</s>  why id go through it all again for thatgolden head alone</s>  shove on shove on before they change their mindsit seems too good to be true</s> just then a rotten egg thrown by some sweet abati youth landed full onthe bridge of his nose and dispersing itself into his mouth and overhis smoked spectacles cut short the professors eloquence or ratherchanged its tenor</s>  so absurd was the sight that in spite of myself iburst out laughing and with that laugh felt my heart grow lighter asthough our clouds of trouble were lifting at length</s> at the mouth of the pass we found joshua himself waiting for us cladin all his finery and chain armour and looking more like a porpoise onhorseback than he had ever done</s> farewell gentiles he said bowing to us in mockery we wish you aquick journey to sheol or wherever such swine as you may go</s>  listenyou orme</s>  i have a message for you from the walda nagasta</s>  it is thatshe is sorry she could not ask you to stop for her nuptial feast whichshe would have done had she not been sure that if you stayed thepeople would have cut your throat and she did not wish the holy soil ofmur to be defiled with your dogs blood</s>  also she bids me say that shehopes that your stay here will have taught you a lesson and that infuture you will not believe that every woman who makes use of you forher own ends is therefore a victim of your charms</s>  tomorrow night andthe night after i pray you think of our happiness and drink a cup ofwine to the walda nagasta and her husband</s>  come will you not wish mejoy o gentile</s> orme turned white as a sheet and gazed at him steadily</s>  then a strangelook came into his grey eyes almost a look of inspiration</s> prince joshua he said in a very quiet voice who knows what mayhappen before the sun rises thrice on mur</s>  all things that begin well donot end well as i have learned and as you also may live to learn</s>  atleast soon or late your day of reckoning must come and you too maybe betrayed as i have been</s>  rather should you ask me to forgive yoursoul the insults that in your hour of triumph you have not been ashamedto heap upon one who is powerless to avenge them and he urged hiscamel past him</s> as we followed i saw joshuas face turn as pale as olivers had doneand his great round eyes protrude themselves like those of a fish</s>
 said the prince to his companions</s>  pray god he isnot a prophet of evil</s>  even now i have a mindno let him go</s>  to breakmy marriage vow might bring bad luck upon me</s>  let him go</s>  and he glaredafter oliver with fear and hatred written on his coarse features</s> that was the last we ever saw of joshua uncle of maqueda and firstprince among the abati</s> down the pass we went and through the various gates of thefortifications which were thrown open as we came and closed behind us</s> we did not linger on that journey</s>  why should we when our guards wereanxious to be rid of us and we of them</s>  indeed so soon as the last gatewas behind us either from fear of the fung or because they were in ahurry to return to share in the festivities of the approaching marriagesuddenly the abati wheeled round bade us farewell with a parting curseand left us to our own devices</s> so having roped the camels into a long line we went on alone trulythankful to be rid of them and praying every one of us that neverin this world or the next might we see the face or hear the voice ofanother abati</s> we emerged on to the plain at the spot where months before we had heldour conference with barung sultan of the fung and where poor quick hadforced his camel on to joshuas horse and dismounted that hero</s>  here wepaused awhile to arrange our little caravan and arm ourselves withthe rifles revolvers and cartridges which until now we had not beenallowed to touch</s> there were but four of us to manage the long train of camels so we wereobliged to separate</s>  higgs and i went ahead since i was best acquaintedwith the desert and the road oliver took the central station androderick brought up the rear because he was very keen of sight andhearing and from his long familiarity with them knew how to drivecamels that showed signs of obstinacy or a wish to turn</s> on our right lay the great city of harmac</s>  we noted that it seemed to bequite deserted</s>  there rebuilt now frowned the gateway through which wehad escaped from the fung after we had blown so many of them to piecesbut beneath it none passed in or out</s>  the town was empty and althoughthey were dead ripe the rich crops had not yet been reaped</s>  apparentlythe fung people had now left the land</s> now we were opposite to the valley of harmac and saw that the hugesphinx still sat there as it had done for unknown thousands of years</s> only its head was gone for that had moved to mur and in its neckand shoulders appeared great clefts caused by the terrific force of theexplosion</s>  moreover no sound came from the enclosures where the sacredlions used to be</s>  doubtless every one of them was dead</s> dont you think suggested higgs whose archological zeal wasrekindling fast that we might spare halfanhour to go up the valleyand have a look at harmac from the outside</s>  of course both roderick andi are thoroughly acquainted with his inside and the den of lions andso forth but i would give a great deal just to study the rest of himand take a few measurements</s>  you know one must camp somewhere and if wecant find the camera at dawn one might make a sketch</s> are you mad</s>  i asked by way of answer and higgs collapsed but tothis hour he has never forgiven me</s> we looked our last upon harmac the god whose glory we had destroyedand went on swiftly till darkness overtook us almost opposite to thatruined village where shadrach had tried to poison the hound pharaohwhich afterwards tore out his throat</s>  here we unloaded the camels nolight task and camped for near this spot there was water and a patchof maize on which the beasts could feed</s> before the light quite faded roderick rode forward for a little way toreconnoitre and presently returned announcing shortly that he had seenno one</s>  so we ate of the food with which the abati had provided us notwithout fear lest it should be poisoned and then held a council of war</s> the question was whether we should take the old road toward egypt ornow that the swamps were dry strike up northward by the other route ofwhich shadrach had told us</s>  according to the map this should be shorterand higgs advocated it strongly as i discovered afterwards because hethought there might be more archological remains in that direction</s> i on the other hand was in favour of following the road we knewwhich although long and very wearisome was comparatively safe as inthat vast desert there were few people to attack us while oliver ourcaptain listened to all we had to say and reserved his opinion</s> presently however the question was settled for us by roderick whoremarked that if we travelled to the north we should probably fall inwith the fung</s>  i asked what he meant and he replied that when he madehis reconnaissance an hour or so before although it was true that hehad seen no one not a thousand yards from where we sat he had comeacross the track of a great army</s>  this army from various indicationshe felt sure was that of barung which had passed there within twelvehours</s> perhaps my wife with them so i no want to go that way father headded with sincere simplicity</s> where could they be travelling</s>  i asked</s> dont know he answered but think they go round to attack mur fromother side or perhaps to find new land to north</s> we will stick to the old road said oliver briefly</s>  like roderick ihave had enough of all the inhabitants of this country</s>  now let us restawhile we need it</s> about two oclock we were up again and before it was dawn on thefollowing morning we had loaded our camels and were on the road</s>  by thefirst faint light we saw that what roderick had told us was true</s>  wewere crossing the track of an army of many thousand men who had passedthere recently with laden camels and horses</s>  moreover those men werefung for we picked up some articles that could have belonged to noother people such as a headdress that had been lost or thrown awayand an arrow that had fallen from a quiver</s> however we saw nothing of them and travelling fast to our greatrelief by midday reached the river ebur which we crossed withoutdifficulty for it was now low</s>  that night we camped in the forestlandsbeyond having all the afternoon marched up the rising ground at thefoot of which ran the river</s> toward dawn higgs whose turn it was to watch the camels came and wokeme</s> sorry to disturb you old fellow he said but there is a mostcurious sky effect behind us which i thought you might like to see</s> i rose and looked</s>  in the clear starlight night i could just discernthe mighty outline of the mountains of mur</s>  above them the firmament wassuffused with a strange red glow</s>  i formed my own conclusion at oncebut only saidlet us go to tell orme and led the way to where he had lain downunder a tree</s> he was not sleeping indeed i do not think he had closed his eyes allnight the night of maquedas marriage</s>  on the contrary he was standingon a little knoll staring at the distant mountains and the glow abovethem</s> mur is on fire he said solemnly</s>  oh my god mur is on fire</s>  andturning he walked away</s> just then roderick joined us</s> fung got into mur he said and now cut throat of all abati</s>  we wellout of that but pig joshua have very warm wedding feast because barunghate joshua who try to catch him not fairly which he never forgetoften talk of it</s> poor maqueda</s>  i said to higgs what will happen to her</s> i dont know he answered but although once like everybody elsei adored that girl really as a matter of justice she deserves all shegets the falsehearted little wretch</s>  still it is true he addedrelenting she gave us very good camels to say nothing of theirloads</s> but i only repeated poor maqueda</s> that day we made but a short journey since we wished to rest ourselvesand fill the camels before plunging into the wilderness and feelingsure that we should not be pursued had no cause to hurry</s>  at night wecamped in a little hollow by a stream that ran at the foot of a rise</s>  asdawn broke we were awakened by the voice of roderick who was on watchcalling to us in tones of alarm to get up as we were followed</s>  wesprang to our feet seizing our rifles</s> where are they</s>  i asked</s> there there he said pointing toward the rise behind us</s> we ran round some intervening bushes and looked to see upon its crest asolitary figure seated on a very tired horse for it panted and its headdrooped</s>  this figure which was entirely hidden in a long cloak witha hood appeared to be watching our camp just as a spy might do</s>  higgslifted his rifle and fired at it but oliver who was standing by himknocked the barrel up so that the bullet went high sayingdont be a fool</s>  if it is only one man theres no need to shoot himand if there are more you will bring them on to us</s> then the figure urged the weary horse and advanced slowly and i noticedthat it was very small</s>  a boy i thought to myself who is bringingsome message</s> the rider reached us and slipping from the horse stood still</s> who are you</s>  asked oliver scanning the cloaked form</s> one who brings a token to you lord was the answer spoken in a lowand muffled voice</s>  here it is and a hand a very delicate hand wasstretched out holding between the fingers a ring</s> i knew it at once it was shebas ring which maqueda had lent to me inproof of her good faith when i journeyed for help to england</s>  this ringit will be remembered we returned to her with much ceremony at ourfirst public audience</s>  oliver grew pale at the sight of it</s> how did you come by this</s>  he asked hoarsely</s>  is she who alone maywear it dead</s> yes yes answered the voice a feigned voice as i thought</s>  the childof kings whom you knew is dead and having no more need for this ancientsymbol of her power she bequeathed it to you whom she remembered kindlyat the last</s> oliver covered his face with his hands and turned away</s> but went on the speaker slowly the woman maqueda whom once it issaid you lovedhe dropped his hands and stared</s> the woman maqueda whom once it is said youlovedstill lives</s> then the hood slipped back and in the glow of the rising sun we saw theface beneath</s> it was that of maqueda herself</s> a silence followed that in its way was almost awful</s> my lord oliver asked maqueda presently do you accept my offering ofqueen shebas ring</s> note by maquedaonce called walda nagasta and takla warda that is child of kings andbud of the rose once also by birth ruler of the abati people the sonsof solomon and sheba</s> i maqueda write this by the command of oliver my lord who desiresthat i should set out certain things in my own words</s> truly all men are fools and the greatest of them is oliver my lordthough perhaps he is almost equalled by the learned man whom the abaticalled black windows and by the doctor son of adam</s>  only he who isnamed roderick child of adam is somewhat less blind because havingbeen brought up among the fung and other people of the desert he hasgathered a little wisdom</s>  this i know because he has told me that healone saw through my plan to save all their lives but said nothing ofit because he desired to escape from mur where certain death waited onhim and his companions</s>  perhaps however he lies to please me</s> now for the truth of the matter which not being skilled in writing iwill tell briefly</s> i was carried out of the cave city with my lord and the othersstarving starving too weak to kill myself which otherwise i wouldhave done rather than fall into the hands of my accursed uncle joshua</s> yet i was stronger than the rest because as i have learned theytricked me about those biscuits pretending to eat when they were noteating for which never will i forgive them</s>  it was japhet a gallantman on one side but a coward on the other like the rest of the abatiwho betrayed us driven thereto by emptiness within which after allis an ill enemy to fight</s>  he went out and told joshua where we lay hidand then of course they came</s> well they took away my lord and the others and me too they bore toanother place and fed me till my strength returned and oh</s>  how good wasthat honey which first i ate for i could touch nothing else</s>  when i wasstrong again came prince joshua to me and said now i have you in mynet now you are mine</s> then i answered joshua fool your net is of air i will fly throughit</s> how</s>  he asked</s>  by death i answered of which a hundred means lieto my hand</s>  you have robbed me of one but what does that matter when somany remain</s>  i will go where you and your love cannot pursue me</s> very well child of kings he said but how about that tall gentilewho has caught your eyes and his companions</s>  they too have recoveredand they shall die every one of them after a certain fashion which imaqueda will not set down since there are some things that ought notto be written</s>
now i looked this way and that and found that there was no escape</s>  so imade a bargain</s> joshua i said let these men go and i swear upon the name of ourmother she of sheba that i will marry you</s>  keep them and kill themand you will have none of me</s> well in the end because he desired me and the power that went with mehe consented</s> then i played my part</s>  my lord and his companions were brought beforeme and in presence of all the people i mocked them i spat in theirfaces and oh</s>  fools fools fools they believed me</s>  i lifted my veiland showed them my eyes and they believed also what they seemed to seein my eyes forgetting that i am a woman who can play a part at need</s> yes they forgot that there were others to deceive as well all theabati people who if they thought i tricked them would have torn theforeigners limb from limb</s>  that was my bitterest morsel that i shouldhave succeeded in making even my own lord believe that of all the wickedwomen that ever trod this world i was the most vile</s>  yet i did so andhe cannot deny it for often we have talked of this thing till he willhear of it no more</s> well they went with all that i could give them though i knew well thatmy lord cared nothing for what i could give nor the doctor child ofadam either who cared only for his son that god had restored to him</s> only black windows cared not because he loves wealth but because heworships all that is old and ugly for of such things he fashions up hisgod</s> they went for their going was reported to me and i i entered intohell because i knew that my lord thought me false and that he wouldnever learn the truth namely that what i did i did to save his lifeuntil at length he came to his own country if ever he came there andopened the chests of treasure if ever he opened them which perhaps hewould not care to do</s>  and all that while he would believe me the wifeof joshua andoh</s>  i cannot write of it</s>  and i i should be dead i icould not tell him the truth until he joined me in that land of deathif there men and women can talk together any more</s> for this and no other was the road that i had planned to walk</s>  when heand his companions had gone so far that they could not be followedthen i would tell joshua and the abati all the truth in such language asshould never be forgotten for generations and kill myself before theireyes so that joshua might lack a wife and the abati a child of kings</s> i sat through the feast of preparation and smiled and smiled</s>  it passedand the next day passed and came the night of the feast of marriage</s> the glass was broken the ceremony was fulfilled</s>  joshua rose up topledge me before all the priests lords and headmen</s>  he devoured mewith his hateful eyes me who was already his</s>  but i i handled theknife in my robe wishing such was the rage in my heart that i couldkill him also</s> then god spoke and the dream that i had dreamed came true</s>  far awaythere rose a single cry and after it other cries and the sounds ofshouting and of marching feet</s>  far away tongues of fire leapt into theair and each man asked his neighbour what is this</s>  then from all thethousands of the feasting people rose one giant scream and that screamsaid fung</s>  fung</s>  the fung are on us</s>  fly fly fly</s> come shouted joshua seizing me by the arm but i drew my dagger onhim and he let go</s>  then he fled with the other lords and i remained inmy high seat beneath the golden canopy alone</s> the people fled past me without fighting they fled into the cave citythey fled to the rocks they hid themselves among the precipices andafter them came the fung slaying and burning till all mur went up inflames</s>  and i i sat and watched waiting till it was time for me to diealso</s> at last i know not how long afterwards appeared before me barung ared sword in his hand which he lifted to me in salute</s> greeting child of kings he said</s>  you see harmac is come to sleep atmur</s> yes i answered harmac is come to sleep at mur and many of thosewho dwelt there sleep with him</s>  what of it</s>  say barung will you killme or shall i kill myself</s> neither child of kings he answered in his high fashion</s>  did i notmake you a promise yonder in the pass of mur when i spoke with you andthe western men and does a fung sultan break his word</s>  i have takenback the city that was ours as i swore to do and purified it withfire and he pointed to the raging flames</s>  now i will rebuild it andyou shall rule under me</s> not so i answered but in place of that promise i ask of you threethings</s> name them said barung</s> they are these first that you give me a good horse and five daysfood and let me go where i will</s>  secondly that if he still lives youadvance one japhet a certain mountaineer who befriended me and broughtothers to do likewise to a place of honour under you</s>  thirdly that youspare the rest of the abati people</s> you shall go whither you desire and i think i know where you will goanswered barung</s>  certain spies of mine last night saw four white menriding on fine camels towards egypt and reported it to me as i led myarmy to the secret pass that harmac showed me which you abati couldnever find</s>  but i said let them go it is right that brave men whohave been the mock of the abati should be allowed their freedom</s>  yesi said this although one of them was my daughters husband or near toit</s>  but she will have no more of him who fled to his father rather thanwith her so it was best that he should go also since if i brought himback it must be to his death</s> yes i answered boldly i go after the western men i who have donewith these abati</s>  i wish to see new lands</s> and find an old love who thinks ill of you just now he said strokinghis beard</s>  well no wonder for here has been a marriage feast</s>  saywhat were you about to do o child of kings</s>  take the fat joshua to yourbreast</s> nay barung i was about to take this husband to my breast and ishowed him the knife that was hidden in my marriage robe</s> no he said smiling i think the knife was for joshua first</s>  stillyou are a brave woman who could save the life of him you love atthe cost of your own</s>  yet bethink you child of kings for many ageneration your mothers have been queens and under me you may stillremain a queen</s>  how will one whose blood has ruled so long endure toserve a western man in a strange land</s> that is what i go to find out barung and if i cannot endure then ishall come back again though not to rule the abati of whom i wash myhands for ever</s>  yet barung my heart tells me i shall endure</s> the child of kings has spoken he said bowing to me</s>  my best horseawaits her and five of my bravest guards shall ride with her to keepher safe till she sights the camp of the western men</s>  i say happy is heof them who was born to wear the sweetscented bud of the rose upon hisbosom</s>  for the rest the man japhet is in my hands</s>  he yielded himselfto me who would not fight for his own people because of what they haddone to his friends the white men</s>  lastly already i have given ordersthat the slaying should cease since i need the abati to be my slavesthey who are cowards but cunning in many arts</s>  only one more man shalldie he added sternly and that is joshua who would have taken me bya trick in the mouth of the pass</s>  so plead not for him for by the headof harmac it is in vain</s> now hearing this i did not plead fearing lest i should anger barungand but waste my breath</s> at daybreak i started on the horse having with me the five fungcaptains</s>  as we crossed the marketplace i met those that remained aliveof the abati being driven in hordes like beasts to hear their doom</s> among them was prince joshua my uncle whom a man led by a rope abouthis neck while another man thrust him forward from behind since joshuaknew that he went to his death and the road was one which he did notwish to travel</s>  he saw me and cast himself down upon the ground cryingto me to save him</s>  i told him that i could not though it is the truthi swear it before god that notwithstanding all the evil he had workedtoward me toward oliver my lord and his companions bringing to hisend that gallant man who died to protect me i would still have savedhim if i could</s>  but i could not for although i tried once more barungwould not listen</s>  so i answeredplead o joshua with him who has the power in mur today for i havenone</s>  you have fashioned your own fate and must travel the road youchose</s> what road do you ride mounted on a horse of the plains maqueda</s>  oh</s> what need is there for me to ask</s>  you go to see that accursed gentilewhom i would i had killed by inches as i would that i could kill you</s> then calling me by evil names joshua sprang at me as though to strikeme down but he who held the rope about his neck jerked him backward sothat he fell and i saw his face no more</s> but oh</s>  it was sad that journey across the great square for thecaptive abati by hundredsmen women and children togetherwith tearsand lamentations cried to me to preserve them from death or slavery atthe hands of the fung</s>  but i answeredyour sins against me and the brave foreign men who fought so wellfor you i forgive but search your hearts o abati and say if you canforgive yourselves</s>  if you had listened to me and to those whom i calledin to help us you might have beaten back the fung and remained freefor ever</s>  but you were cowards you would not learn to bear arms likemen you would not even watch your mountain walls and soon or late thepeople who refuse to be ready to fight must fall and become the servantsof those who are ready</s> and now my oliver i have no more to write save that i am glad to haveendured so many things and thereby win the joy that is mine today</s> not yet have i maqueda wished to reign again in mur who have foundanother throne</s> </s>
