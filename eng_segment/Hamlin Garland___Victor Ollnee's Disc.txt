there were some talltin horns standing in the corner</s>  oh yes and always an old walnuttable</s>  theres something queer about that</s>  i dont understand why mymother should have taken that table

me just thesame</s>  im going to earn her living and mine in some honest way</s> two or three of his most intimate friends came up after breakfast andstarted in to chaff but being far past the stage

adorable</s>  the poise of her bustand her fine head appealed to him with power but her humor her coolclear gaze checked the crude compliments which he was moved to utter</s> she could not be

 you mended itdidnt you</s> yes i mended it</s> and you had a message from altair</s>

yes father</s> take the boysitthe old place</s>  leave pettus out</s> yes father</s> i will be there</s>  pettus is under investigation</s> much obliged said victor and then he heard close to his ear

explained the whisper</s>  altair is smiling at you</s>  she says she willbe with us tonight</s> all this was very shocking to victor</s>  utterly disconcerted and unable toconfront her at the moment

question of how she did it it was a question of her right to deceivehim</s> he seized the time between tea and dinner to return to the library</s>  foran hour he dug into the spongy soil of metaphysics and it happened thathe fell at last upon the crookes and zllner experiments quoted atgreater length in a volume of collected experience and found thereclear and direct testimony as to the minds mastery of matter</s>  there wasabundant evidence of the handling of fire by the medium home andslades ability to float in the air was attested by wellknownwitnesses but beyond this and closer to his own day he came upon adetailed study of an italian psychic with her supernumerary hands astory which should have made the materialization of a letter seem verysimple</s>  but it did not</s>  all the testimony of these great men abundantas it was slid from his mind as harmlessly as water from oiled silk</s> apparently it failed to alter the texture of his thought in theslightest degree</s>

of manner</s>  his own position had beenweakened he felt by his acquiescence in the sitting</s>  his desire tosatisfy himself to solve his mothers mystery had led him to abandonhis stern resolutionand he regretted it</s>  he ate sparingly and took nowine being resolved to retain a perfectly clear head for the eveningsexperiment</s>  he was grateful to leo for keeping the talk on subjects ofgeneral

tonight</s> the papers of the day had remained free from any further allusion tothe spiritual bloodsuckers and it really seemed as if the cloudmight be lifting and this consideration made his participation in thesitting all the more like a return to a lower and less defensibleposition</s>  he was irritated by the methodical action with which hismother proceeded to set the stage for her farce</s>  wood who seemed quiteat home assisted in these preparations leaving victor leaning insullen silence against the wall</s> mrs</s>  joyce took a seat directly opposite the little psychic wood

irritated and wellnighestranged him</s>  why should his life be thrown into the midst of suchcheap and illodored drama</s>  this shall never happen again he vowedbeneath his breath</s> there was not much talk during the first halfhour for the reason thatvictor was too selfaccusing to talk and the others were too solemn andtoo eager for results to enter upon general conversation</s>  for the mostpart they spoke in low voices and waited and listened</s> the first indication of anything unusual aside from the tapping was abreeze a deathly cold wind which began to blow faintly over the tablefrom his mother bearing a peculiar perfume an odor like that fromsome oriental rug which grew in power till each of the sittersremarked upon it</s>  this current of air continued so long and souninterruptedly that victor began to wonder</s>  could it be his mothersbreath</s>  if she were not fraudulently producing it then it must be thatsome window had been opened</s>  the network of her

mrs</s>  joyce explained</s>  she is gone</s> again the cold breeze set in with a strong steady swell and with itwas borne a low humming note which grew in volume and depth till itresembled the roaring rush of a november blast through the branches ofan oak</s>  it became awesome at last with its majesty of moaning song andsaddening with its somber suggestion of autumn and of death</s>  it openedthe shabby little room upon an empty and limitless space upon aninfinite and vacant and obscure desert wherein night and stormscontended</s>  it died away at last leaving the air chill and pulselessand the chamber darker than before</s> before any comment could be made upon this astounding phenomenon victorperceived a faint glow of phosphorus upon the table</s>  it increased inbrilliancy till it presented a clearcut square of some greenishglowing substance and then a large hand in a ruffled sleeve appearedabove it as if in the act of writing</s> it is watts whispered leo</s>  he is writing for us</s> bending forward victor was able to read this message outlined in darkscript on the glowing surface of what seemed to be the slate thedreams of today are the realities

the glowing slate and held it like a lamp to his mothers faceso that all might see her</s>  she sat with hands outspread upon the tableher head thrown back her eyes closed</s>  her arms extended in rigid lines</s> it seemed that the invisible ones desired to prove to victor that hismother could not and was not holding the slate</s> swift as light the glowing mirror disappeared and then as if through awindow opened in the air before his eyes victor perceived a strangeface confronting him the face of a girl with deep and tender eyesincredibly beautiful</s>  her eyes were in shadow but the pure oval of hercheeks the dainty grace of her chin the broad full brow and somethingineffably pure in the faintly happy smile stopped his breath with awe</s> he forgot his mother his problems his doubts in study of theunearthly beauty of this vision</s>
mrs</s>  joyce whispered in ecstasy it is altair</s> the angelic lips parted and a low voice so gentle it was like themurmur of a leaf replied yes it is altair</s>

there was no question of hismothers honesty in his mind</s>  he did not relate the vision to her andhe winced with pain as leo spoke</s>  he wished to recall the face to hearthat whisper again</s>  the effect upon him was enormous instantunfolding</s>  in all his life nothing mystic nothing to disturb or rousehis imagination had hitherto come to him and now this transcendentmarvel this face born
