 and there rides ney with his redhead and lefebvre with his bulldog jaw and lannes with his gasconswagger and then amidst the gleam of brass and the flaunting feathers icatch a glimpse of him the man with the pale smile the roundedshoulders and the faroff eyes</s>  there is an end of my sleep myfriends for up i spring from my chair with a cracked voice calling anda silly hand outstretched so that madame titaux has one more laugh atthe old fellow who lives among the shadows</s> although i was a full chief of brigade when the wars came to an end andhad every hope of soon being made a general of division it is stillrather to my earlier days that i turn when i wish to talk of the gloriesand the trials of a soldiers life</s>  for you will understand that when anofficer has so many men and horses under him he has his mind full ofrecruits and remounts fodder and farriers and quarters so that evenwhen he is not in the face of the enemy life is a very serious matterfor him</s>  but when he is only a lieutenant or a captain he has nothingheavier than his epaulettes upon his shoulders so that he can clink hisspurs and swing his dolman drain his glass and kiss his girl thinkingof nothing save of enjoying a gallant life</s>  that is the time when he islikely to have adventures and it is often to that time that i shallturn in the stories which i may have for you</s>  so it will be tonight wheni tell you of my visit to the castle of gloom of the strange mission ofsublieutenant duroc and of the horrible affair of the man who was onceknown as jean carabin and afterwards as the baron straubenthal</s> you must know then that in the february of 1807 immediately after thetaking of danzig major legendre and i were commissioned to bring fourhundred remounts from prussia into eastern poland</s> the hard weather and especially the great battle at eylau had killedso many of the horses that there was some danger of our beautiful tenthof hussars becoming a battalion of light infantry</s>  we knew thereforeboth the major and i that we should be very welcome at the front</s>  wedid not advance very rapidly however for the snow was deep the roadsdetestable and we had but twenty returning invalids to assist us</s> besides it is impossible when you have a daily change of forage andsometimes none at all to move horses faster than a walk</s>  i am awarethat in the storybooks the cavalry whirls past at the maddest ofgallops but for my own part after twelve campaigns i should be verysatisfied to know that my brigade could always walk upon the march andtrot in the presence of the enemy</s>  this i say of the hussars andchasseurs mark you so that it is far more the case with cuirassiers ordragoons</s> for myself i am fond of horses and to have four hundred of them ofevery age and shade and character all under my own hands was a verygreat pleasure to me</s>  they were from pomerania for the most part thoughsome were from normandy and some from alsace and it amused us to noticethat they differed in character as much as the people of thoseprovinces</s>  we observed also what i have often proved since that thenature of a horse can be told by his colour from the coquettish lightbay full of fancies and nerves to the hardy chestnut and from thedocile roan to the pigheaded rustyblack</s>  all this has nothing in theworld to do with my story but how is an officer of cavalry to get onwith his tale when he finds four hundred horses waiting for him at theoutset</s>  it is my habit you see to talk of that which interests myselfand so i hope that i may interest you</s> we crossed the vistula opposite marienwerder and had got as far asriesenberg when major legendre came into my room in the posthouse withan open paper in his hand</s> you are to leave me said he with despair upon his face</s> it was no very great grief to me to do that for he was if i may sayso hardly worthy to have such a subaltern</s>  i saluted however insilence</s> it is an order from general lasalle he continued you are toproceed to rossel instantly and to report yourself at the headquartersof the regiment</s> no message could have pleased me better</s>  i was already very well thoughtof by my superior officers</s>  it was evident to me therefore that thissudden order meant that the regiment was about to see service once moreand that lasalle understood how incomplete my squadron would be withoutme</s>  it is true that it came at an inconvenient moment for the keeper ofthe posthouse had a daughterone of those ivoryskinned blackhairedpolish girlswith whom i had hoped to have some further talk</s>  still itis not for the pawn to argue when the fingers of the player move himfrom the square so down i went saddled my big black charger rataplanand set off instantly upon my lonely journey</s> my word it was a treat for those poor poles and jews who have solittle to brighten their dull lives to see such a picture as thatbefore their doors</s>  the frosty morning air made rataplans great blacklimbs and the beautiful curves of his back and sides gleam and shimmerwith every gambade</s>  as for me the rattle of hoofs upon a road and thejingle of bridle chains which comes with every toss of a saucy headwould even now set my blood dancing through my veins</s>  you may thinkthen how i carried myself in my fiveandtwentieth yeari etiennegerard the picked horseman and surest blade in the ten regiments ofhussars</s>  blue was our colour in the tentha skyblue dolman and pelissewith a scarlet frontand it was said of us in the army that we couldset a whole population running the women towards us and the men away</s> there were bright eyes in the riesenberg windows that morning whichseemed to beg me to tarry but what can a soldier do save to kiss hishand and shake his bridle as he rides upon his way</s> it was a bleak season to ride through the poorest and ugliest country ineurope but there was a cloudless sky above and a bright cold sunwhich shimmered on the huge snowfields</s>  my breath reeked into thefrosty air and rataplan sent up two feathers of steam from hisnostrils while the icicles drooped from the sideirons of his bit</s>  ilet him trot to warm his limbs while for my own part i had too much tothink of to give much heed to the cold</s>  to north and south stretched thegreat plains mottled over with dark clumps of fir and lighter patchesof larch</s>  a few cottages peeped out here and there but it was onlythree months since the grand army had passed that way and you know whatthat meant to a country</s>  the poles were our friends it was true butout of a hundred thousand men only the guard had waggons and the resthad to live as best they might</s>  it did not surprise me therefore tosee no signs of cattle and no smoke from the silent houses</s>  a weal hadbeen left across the country where the great host had passed and it wassaid that even the rats were starved wherever the emperor had led hismen</s> by midday i had got as far as the village of saalfeldt but as i was onthe direct road for osterode where the emperor was wintering and alsofor the main camp of the seven divisions of infantry the highway waschoked with carriages and carts</s>  what with artillery caissons andwaggons and couriers and the everthickening stream of recruits andstragglers it seemed to me that it would be a very long time before ishould join my comrades</s>  the plains however were five feet deep insnow so there was nothing for it but to plod upon our way</s>  it was withjoy therefore that i found a second road which branched away from theother trending through a firwood towards the north</s>  there was a smallauberge at the crossroads and a patrol of the third hussars ofconflansthe very regiment of which i was afterwards colonelweremounting their horses at the door</s>  on the steps stood their officer aslight pale young man who looked more like a young priest from aseminary than a leader of the devilmaycare rascals before him</s> goodday sir said he seeing that i pulled up my horse</s> goodday i answered</s>  i am lieutenant etienne gerard of the tenth</s> i could see by his face that he had heard of me</s>  everybody had heard ofme since my duel with the six fencing masters</s>  my manner howeverserved to put him at his ease with me</s> i am sublieutenant duroc of the third said he</s> newly joined</s>  i asked</s>
i had thought as much from his white face and from the way in which helet his men lounge upon their horses</s>  it was not so long however sincei had learned myself what it was like when a schoolboy has to giveorders to veteran troopers</s>  it made me blush i remember to shoutabrupt commands to men who had seen more battles than i had years andit would have come more natural for me to say with your permission weshall now wheel into line or if you think it best we shall trot</s>  idid not think the less of the lad therefore when i observed that hismen were somewhat out of hand but i gave them a glance which stiffenedthem in their saddles</s> may i ask monsieur whether you are going by this northern road</s>  iasked</s> my orders are to patrol it as far as arensdorf said he</s> then i will with your permission ride so far with you said i</s>  itis very clear that the longer way will be the faster</s> so it proved for this road led away from the army into a country whichwas given over to cossacks and marauders and it was as bare as theother was crowded</s>  duroc and i rode in front with our six troopersclattering in the rear</s>  he was a good boy this duroc with his headfull of the nonsense that they teach at st cyr knowing more aboutalexander and pompey than how to mix a horses fodder or care for ahorses feet</s>  still he was as i have said a good boy unspoiled asyet by the camp</s>  it pleased me to hear him prattle away about hissister marie and about his mother in amiens</s>  presently we foundourselves at the village of hayenau</s>  duroc rode up to the posthouse andasked to see the master</s> can you tell me said he whether the man who calls himself the baronstraubenthal lives in these parts</s> the postmaster shook his head and we rode upon our way</s>  i took nonotice of this but when at the next village my comrade repeated thesame question with the same result i could not help asking him whothis baron straubenthal might be</s> he is a man said duroc with a sudden flush upon his boyish face towhom i have a very important message to convey</s> well this was not satisfactory but there was something in mycompanions manner which told me that any further questioning would bedistasteful to him</s>  i said nothing more therefore but duroc wouldstill ask every peasant whom we met whether he could give him any newsof the baron straubenthal</s>
for my own part i was endeavouring as an officer of light cavalryshould to form an idea of the lay of the country to note the course ofthe streams and to mark the places where there should be fords</s>  everystep was taking us farther from the camp round the flanks of which wewere travelling</s>  far to the south a few plumes of grey smoke in thefrosty air marked the position of some of our outposts</s>  to the northhowever there was nothing between ourselves and the russian winterquarters</s>  twice on the extreme horizon i caught a glimpse of the glitterof steel and pointed it out to my companion</s>  it was too distant for usto tell whence it came but we had little doubt that it was from thelanceheads of marauding cossacks</s>
 a farmer with his cart wasapproaching usa mattedhaired downcast fellow in a sheepskin jacket</s> what village is this</s>  asked duroc</s> it is arensdorf he answered in his barbarous german dialect</s> then here i am to stay the night said my young companion</s>  thenturning to the farmer he asked his eternal question can you tell mewhere the baron straubenthal lives</s> why it is he who owns the castle of gloom said the farmer pointingto the dark turrets over the distant fir forest</s> duroc gave a shout like the sportsman who sees his game rising in frontof him</s>  the lad seemed to have gone off his headhis eyes shining hisface deathly white and such a grim set about his mouth as made thefarmer shrink away from him</s>  i can see him now leaning forward on hisbrown horse with his eager gaze fixed upon the great black tower</s> why do you call it the castle of gloom</s>  i asked</s> well its the name it bears upon the countryside said the farmer</s> by all accounts there have been some black doings up yonder</s>  its notfor nothing that the wickedest man in poland has been living there thesefourteen years past</s> a polish nobleman</s>  i asked</s> nay we breed no such men in poland he answered</s> a frenchman then</s>  cried duroc</s> they say that he came from france</s> and with red hair</s> as red as a fox</s>
 it is the hand of providence which has led me here</s>  who cansay that there is not justice in this world</s>  come monsieur gerard fori must see the men safely quartered before i can attend to this privatematter</s> he spurred on his horse and ten minutes later we were at the door ofthe inn of arensdorf where his men were to find their quarters for thenight</s> well all this was no affair of mine and i could not imagine what themeaning of it might be</s>  rossel was still far off but i determined toride on for a few hours and take my chance of some wayside barn in whichi could find shelter for rataplan and myself</s>  i had mounted my horsetherefore after tossing off a cup of wine when young duroc camerunning out of the door and laid his hand upon my knee</s> monsieur gerard he panted i beg of you not to abandon me likethis</s> my good sir said i if you would tell me what is the matter and whatyou would wish me to do i should be better able to tell you if i couldbe of any assistance to you</s> you can be of the very greatest he cried</s>  indeed from all that ihave heard of you monsieur gerard you are the one man whom i shouldwish to have by my side tonight</s> you forget that i am riding to join my regiment</s> you cannot in any case reach it tonight</s>  tomorrow will bring you torossel</s>  by staying with me you will confer the very greatest kindnessupon me and you will aid me in a matter which concerns my own honourand the honour of my family</s>  i am compelled however to confess to youthat some personal danger may possibly be involved</s> it was a crafty thing for him to say</s>  of course i sprang fromrataplans back and ordered the groom to lead him back into the stables</s> come into the inn said i and let me know exactly what it is thatyou wish me to do</s> he led the way into a sittingroom and fastened the door lest we shouldbe interrupted</s>  he was a wellgrown lad and as he stood in the glare ofthe lamp with the light beating upon his earnest face and upon hisuniform of silver grey which suited him to a marvel i felt my heartwarm towards him</s>  without going so far as to say that he carried himselfas i had done at his age there was at least similarity enough to makeme feel in sympathy with him</s> i can explain it all in a few words said he</s>  if i have not alreadysatisfied your very natural curiosity it is because the subject is sopainful a one to me that i can hardly bring myself to allude to it</s>  icannot however ask for your assistance without explaining to youexactly how the matter lies</s> you must know then that my father was the wellknown bankerchristophe duroc who was murdered by the people during the septembermassacres</s>  as you are aware the mob took possession of the prisonschose three socalled judges to pass sentence upon the unhappyaristocrats and then tore them to pieces when they were passed out intothe street</s>  my father had been a benefactor of the poor all his life</s> there were many to plead for him</s>  he had the fever too and was carriedin halfdead upon a blanket</s>  two of the judges were in favour ofacquitting him the third a young jacobin whose huge body and brutalmind had made him a leader among these wretches dragged him with hisown hands from the litter kicked him again and again with his heavyboots and hurled him out of the door where in an instant he was tornlimb from limb under circumstances which are too horrible for me todescribe</s>  this as you perceive was murder even under their ownunlawful laws for two of their own judges had pronounced in my fathersfavour</s> well when the days of order came back again my elder brother began tomake inquiries about this man</s>  i was only a child then but it was afamily matter and it was discussed in my presence</s>  the fellows namewas carabin</s>  he was one of sansterres guard and a noted duellist</s>  aforeign lady named the baroness straubenthal having been dragged beforethe jacobins he had gained her liberty for her on the promise that shewith her money and estates should be his</s>
 he had married her taken hername and title and escaped out of france at the time of the fall ofrobespierre</s>  what had become of him we had no means of learning</s> you will think doubtless that it would be easy for us to find himsince we had both his name and his title</s>
 you must remember howeverthat the revolution left us without money and that without money such asearch is very difficult</s>  then came the empire and it became moredifficult still for as you are aware the emperor considered that the18th brumaire brought all accounts to a settlement and that on that daya veil had been drawn across the past</s>  none the less we kept our ownfamily story and our own family plans</s> my brother joined the army and passed with it through all southerneurope asking everywhere for the baron straubenthal</s>  last october hewas killed at jena with his mission still unfulfilled</s>  then it becamemy turn and i have the good fortune to hear of the very man of whom iam in search at one of the first polish villages which i have to visitand within a fortnight of joining my regiment</s>  and then to make thematter even better i find myself in the company of one whose name isnever mentioned throughout the army save in connection with some daringand generous deed</s> this was all very well and i listened to it with the greatest interestbut i was none the clearer as to what young duroc wished me to do</s> how can i be of service to you</s>  i asked</s> by coming up with me</s> to the castle</s> precisely</s> when</s> at once</s> but what do you intend to do</s> i shall know what to do</s>  but i wish you to be with me all the same</s> well it was never in my nature to refuse an adventure and besides ihad every sympathy with the lads feelings</s>  it is very well to forgiveones enemies but one wishes to give them something to forgive also</s>  iheld out my hand to him therefore</s> i must be on my way for rossel tomorrow morning but tonight i amyours said i</s> we left our troopers in snug quarters and as it was but a mile to thecastle we did not disturb our horses</s>  to tell the truth i hate to seea cavalry man walk and i hold that just as he is the most gallant thingupon earth when he has his saddleflaps between his knees so he is themost clumsy when he has to loop up his sabre and his sabretasche in onehand and turn in his toes for fear of catching the rowels of his spurs</s> still duroc and i were of the age when one can carry things off and idare swear that no woman at least would have quarrelled with theappearance of the two young hussars one in blue and one in grey whoset out that night from the arensdorf posthouse</s>  we both carried ourswords and for my own part i slipped a pistol from my holster into theinside of my pelisse for it seemed to me that there might be some wildwork before us</s> the track which led to the castle wound through a pitchblack firwoodwhere we could see nothing save the ragged patch of stars above ourheads</s>  presently however it opened up and there was the castle rightin front of us about as far as a carbine would carry</s>  it was a hugeuncouth place and bore every mark of being exceedingly old withturrets at every corner and a square keep on the side which was nearestto us</s>  in all its great shadow there was no sign of light save from asingle window and no sound came from it</s>  to me there was somethingawful in its size and its silence which corresponded so well with itssinister name</s>  my companion pressed on eagerly and i followed him alongthe illkept path which led to the gate</s> there was no bell or knocker upon the great ironstudded door and itwas only by pounding with the hilts of our sabres that we could attractattention</s>  a thin hawkfaced man with a beard up to his templesopened it at last</s>  he carried a lantern in one hand and in the other achain which held an enormous black hound</s>  his manner at the first momentwas threatening but the sight of our uniforms and of our faces turnedit into one of sulky reserve</s> the baron straubenthal does not receive visitors at so late an hoursaid he speaking in very excellent french</s> you can inform baron straubenthal that i have come eight hundredleagues to see him and that i will not leave until i have done sosaid my companion</s>  i could not myself have said it with a better voiceand manner</s> the fellow took a sidelong look at us and tugged at his black beard inhis perplexity</s> to tell the truth gentlemen said he the baron has a cup or two ofwine in him at this hour and you would certainly find him a moreentertaining companion if you were to come again in the morning</s> he had opened the door a little wider as he spoke and i saw by thelight of the lamp in the hall behind him that three other rough fellowswere standing there one of whom held another of these monstrous hounds</s> duroc must have seen it also but it made no difference to hisresolution</s> enough talk said he pushing the man to one side</s>  it is with yourmaster that i have to

beard who had shut and barred the front door appearedto be the only one among them who could speak french</s> well you shall have your way said he with a sinister smile</s>  youshall see the baron</s>  and perhaps before you have finished you willwish that you had taken my advice</s> we followed him down the hall which was stoneflagged and veryspacious with skins scattered upon the floor and the heads of wildbeasts upon the walls</s>  at the farther end he threw open a door and weentered</s> it was a small room scantily furnished with the same marks of neglectand decay which met us at every

lionlike head and a great shock of orangecoloured hair</s>  hisbeard was of the same glaring hue matted and tangled and coarse as ahorses mane</s>  i have seen some strange faces in my time but never onemore brutal than that with its small vicious blue eyes its whitecrumpled cheeks and the thick hanging lip which protruded over hismonstrous beard</s>  his head swayed about on his shoulders and he lookedat us with the vague dim gaze of a drunken man</s>  yet he was not so drunkbut that our uniforms carried their message to him</s> well my brave boys he hiccoughed</s>  what is the latest news

thesnowcovered path until we were on the fringe of the fir forest</s>  it wasat that moment that i heard a crash behind me and glancing round sawa great spout of fire shoot up into the wintry sky</s>

it was some weeks before i came to myself in the posthouse ofarensdorf and longer still before i could be told all that had befallenme</s>  it was duroc already able to go soldiering who came to my

run toarensdorf how she had roused our hussars and how she had only justbrought them back in time to save us from the spears of the cossacks whohad been summoned from their bivouac by that same blackbeardedsecretary whom we had seen galloping so swiftly over the snow</s>
 as to thebrave lady who had twice saved our lives i could not learn very muchabout her at that moment from duroc but when i chanced to meet him inparis two years later after the campaign of wagram i was not verymuch surprised to find that i needed no introduction to his bride andthat by the queer turns of fortune he had himself had he chosen to useit that very name and title of the baron straubenthal which showed himto be the owner of the blackened ruins of the castle of gloom</s> footnotesfootnote a the term brigadier is used throughout in its english andnot in its french sense</s> 2</s>  how the brigadier slew the brothers of ajacciowhen the emperor needed an agent he was always very ready to do me thehonour of recalling the name of etienne gerard though it occasionallyescaped him when rewards were to be distributed</s>
 still i was a colonelat twentyeight and the chief of a brigade at thirtyone so that ihave no reason to be dissatisfied with my career</s>  had the wars lastedanother two or three years i might have grasped my bton and the manwho had his hand upon that was only one stride from a throne</s>  murat hadchanged his hussars cap for a crown and another light cavalry manmight have done as much</s>  however all those dreams were driven away bywaterloo and although i was not able to write my name upon history itis sufficiently well known by all who served with me in the great warsof the empire</s> what i want to tell you tonight is about the very singular affair whichfirst started me upon my rapid upward course and which had the effectof establishing a secret bond between the emperor and myself</s> there is just one little word of warning which i must give you before ibegin</s>  when you hear me speak you must always bear in mind that you arelistening to one who has seen history from the inside</s>  i am talkingabout what my ears have heard and my eyes have seen so you must not tryto confute me by quoting the opinions of some student or man of the penwho has written a book of history or memoirs</s>  there is much which isunknown by such people and much which never will be known by the world</s> for my own part i could tell you some very surprising things were itdiscreet to do so</s>  the facts which i am about to relate to you tonightwere kept secret by me during the emperors lifetime because i gavehim my promise that it should be so but i do not think that there canbe any harm now in my telling the remarkable part which i played</s> you must know then that at the time of the treaty of tilsit i was asimple lieutenant in the 10th hussars without money or interest</s>  it istrue that my appearance and my gallantry were in my favour and that ihad already won a reputation as being one of the best swordsmen in thearmy but amongst the host of brave men who surrounded the emperor itneeded more than this to insure a rapid career</s>  i was confidenthowever that my chance would come though i never dreamed that it wouldtake so remarkable a form</s> when the emperor returned to paris after the declaration of peace inthe year 1807 he spent much of his time with the empress and the courtat fontainebleau</s>  it was the time when he was at the pinnacle of hiscareer</s>  he had in three successive campaigns humbled austria crushedprussia and made the russians very glad to get upon the right side ofthe niemen</s>  the old bulldog over the channel was still growling but hecould not get very far from his kennel</s>  if we could have made aperpetual peace at that moment france would have taken a higher placethan any nation since the days of the romans</s>  so i have heard the wisefolk say though for my part i had other things to think of</s>  all thegirls were glad to see the army back after its long absence and you maybe sure that i had my share of any favours that were going</s>  you mayjudge how far i was a favourite in those days when i say that even nowin my sixtieth yearbut why should i dwell upon that which is alreadysufficiently well known</s> our regiment of hussars was quartered with the horse chasseurs of theguard at fontainebleau</s>  it is as you know but a little place buriedin the heart of the forest and it was wonderful at this time to see itcrowded with grand dukes and electors and princes who thronged roundnapoleon like puppies round their master each hoping that some bonemight be thrown to him</s>  there was more german than french to be heard inthe street for those who had helped us in the late war had come to begfor a reward and those who had opposed us had come to try and escapetheir punishment</s> and all the time our little man with his pale face and his cold greyeyes was riding to the hunt every morning silent and brooding all ofthem following in his train in the hope that some word would escapehim</s>  and then when the humour seized him he would throw a hundredsquare miles to that man or tear as much off the other round off onekingdom by a river or cut off another by a chain of mountains</s>  that washow he used to do business this little artilleryman whom we had raisedso high with our sabres and our bayonets</s>  he was very civil to usalways for he knew where his power came from</s>  we knew also and showedit by the way in which we carried ourselves</s>  we were agreed youunderstand that he was the finest leader in the world but we did notforget that he had the finest men to lead</s> well one day i was seated in my quarters playing cards with youngmorat of the horse chasseurs when the door opened and in walkedlasalle who was our colonel</s>  you know what a fine swaggering fellow hewas and the skyblue uniform of the tenth suited him to a marvel</s>  myfaith we youngsters were so taken by him that we all swore and dicedand drank and played the deuce whether we liked it or no just that wemight resemble our colonel</s>  we forgot that it was not because he drankor gambled that the emperor was going to make him the head of the lightcavalry but because he had the surest eye for the nature of a positionor for the strength of a column and the best judgment as to wheninfantry could be broken or whether guns were exposed of any man inthe army</s>  we were too young to understand all that however so wewaxed our moustaches and clicked our spurs and let the ferrules of ourscabbards wear out by trailing them along the pavement in the hope thatwe should all become lasalles</s>  when he came clanking into my quartersboth morat and i sprang to our feet</s> my boy said he clapping me on the shoulder the emperor wants tosee you at four oclock</s> the room whirled round me at the words and i had to lean my hands uponthe edge of the cardtable</s> what</s>  i cried</s>  the emperor</s> precisely said he smiling at my astonishment</s> but the emperor does not know of my existence colonel i protested</s> why should he send for me</s> well thats just what puzzles me cried lasalle twirling hismoustache</s>  if he wanted the help of a good sabre why should he descendto one of my lieutenants when he might have found all that he needed atthe head of the regiment</s>  however he added clapping me on theshoulder again in his hearty fashion every man has his chance</s>  i havehad mine otherwise i should not be colonel of the tenth</s>  i must notgrudge you yours</s>  forwards my boy and may it be the first step towardschanging your busby for a cocked hat</s> it was but two oclock so he left me promising to come back and toaccompany me to the palace</s>  my faith what a time i passed and how manyconjectures did i make as to what it was that the emperor could want ofme</s>  i paced up and down my little room in a fever of anticipation</s> sometimes i thought that perhaps he had heard of the guns which we hadtaken at austerlitz but then there were so many who had taken guns atausterlitz and two years had passed since the battle</s>  or it might bethat he wished to reward me for my affair with the aidedecamp of therussian emperor</s>  but then again a cold fit would seize me and i wouldfancy that he had sent for me to reprimand me</s>  there were a few duelswhich he might have taken in ill part and there were one or two littlejokes in paris since the peace</s> but no</s>  i considered the words of lasalle</s>  if he had need of a braveman said lasalle</s> it was obvious that my colonel had some idea of what was in the wind</s>  ifhe had not known that it was to my advantage he would not have been socruel as to congratulate me</s>  my heart glowed with joy as this convictiongrew upon me and i sat down to write to my mother and to tell her thatthe emperor was waiting at that very moment to have my opinion upon amatter of importance</s>  it made me smile as i wrote it to think thatwonderful as it appeared to me it would probably only confirm my motherin her opinion of the emperors good sense</s> at halfpast three i heard a sabre come clanking against every step ofmy wooden stair</s>  it was lasalle and with him was a lame gentleman veryneatly dressed in black with dapper ruffles and cuffs</s>  we did not knowmany civilians we of the army but my word this was one whom we couldnot afford

 hisfigure however and his way of carrying his head and his hands were sowell known that he was always recognized and then the talkers would saywhatever they thought would please him best</s> my first thought was that he would be angry with me for having kept himwaiting but as i approached him we heard the big church clock offontainebleau clang out the hour of ten</s>  it was evident therefore thatit was he who was too soon and not i too late</s>  i remembered his orderthat i should make no remark so contented myself with halting withinfour paces of him clicking my spurs together grounding my sabre andsaluting</s>  he glanced at me and then without a word he turned and walkedslowly through the forest i keeping always about the same distancebehind him</s>  once or twice he seemed to me

ragged patches of moonshinebetween the great black shadows of the trees</s>  my ears are as quick asmy eyes and once or twice i thought that i heard a twig crack but youknow how many sounds there are in a forest at night and how difficultit is even to say what direction they come from</s> we walked for rather more than a mile and i knew exactly what ourdestination was long before we got there</s>  in the centre of one of theglades there is the shattered stump of what must at some time have beena most gigantic tree</s>  it is called the abbots beech and there are somany ghostly stories about it

as we came nearer theyemerged from its shadow and walked forward to meet us</s>  the emperorglanced back at me and slackened his pace a little so that i camewithin arms length of him</s>  you may think that i had my hilt well to thefront and that i had a very good look at these two people who wereapproaching us</s> the one was tall remarkably so and of very spare frame while theother was rather below the usual height and had a brisk determined wayof walking</s>  they each wore black cloaks which were slung right acrosstheir figures and hung down upon one side like the mantles of muratsdragoons</s>  they had flat black caps like those i have since seen inspain which threw their faces into darkness though i could see thegleam of their eyes from beneath them</s>  with the moon behind them andtheir long black shadows walking in front they were such figures as onemight expect to meet at night near the abbots beech</s>  i can rememberthat they had a stealthy way of moving and that as they approached themoonshine formed two white diamonds between their legs and the legs oftheir shadows</s> the emperor had paused and these two strangers came to a stand alsowithin a few paces of us</s>  i had drawn up close to my companions elbowso that the four of us were facing each other without a word spoken</s>  myeyes were particularly fixed upon the taller one because he wasslightly the nearer to me and i became certain as i watched him that hewas in the last state of nervousness</s>  his lean figure was quivering allover and i heard a quick thin panting like that of a tired dog</s> suddenly one of them gave a short hissing signal</s>  the tall man bent hisback and his knees like a diver about to spring but before he couldmove i had jumped with drawn sabre in front of him</s>  at the same instantthe smaller man bounded past me and buried a long poniard in theemperors heart</s> my god</s>  the horror of that moment</s>  it is a marvel that i did not dropdead myself</s>  as in a dream i saw the grey coat whirl convulsivelyround and caught a glimpse in the moonlight of three inches of redpoint which jutted out from between the shoulders</s>  then down he fellwith a dead mans gasp upon the grass and the assassin leaving hisweapon buried in his victim threw up both his hands and shrieked withjoy</s>  but ii drove my sword through his midriff with such franticforce that the mere blow of the hilt against the end of his breastbonesent him six paces before he fell and left my reeking blade ready forthe other</s>  i sprang round upon him with such a lust for blood upon me asi had never felt and never have felt in all my days</s>  as i turned adagger flashed before my eyes and i felt the cold wind of it pass myneck and the villains wrist jar upon

at me over hisshoulder he gave a shriek of despair</s>  the next instant he had vanishedfrom my sight</s> vanished utterly you understand</s>  i rushed to the spot and gazed downinto the black abyss</s>  had he hurled himself over</s>  i had almost made upmy mind that he had done so when a gentle sound rising and falling cameout of the darkness beneath me</s>  it was his breathing once more

labourers</s> it was into this then that he had darted</s>  perhaps he had thought thefool that in the darkness i would not venture to follow him</s>  helittle knew etienne gerard</s>  with a spring i was on the platform withanother i was through the doorway and then hearing him in the corneri hurled myself down upon the top of him</s> he fought like a wild cat but he never had a chance with his shorterweapon</s>  i think that i must have transfixed him with that first madlunge for though he struck and struck his blows had no power in themand presently his dagger tinkled down upon the floor</s>  when i was surethat he was dead i rose up and passed out into the moonlight</s>  i climbedon to the heath again and wandered across it as nearly out of my mindas a man could be</s> with the blood singing in my ears and my naked sword still clutched inmy hand i walked aimlessly on until looking round me i found that ihad come as far as the glade of the abbots beech and saw in thedistance

not hear of my crossing the mountains without anescort for he assured me that el cuchillo the spanish guerilla chiefwas out that way with his band and that it meant a death by torture tofall into his

my faith</s>  it was enough to make a man mad to see this fellow riding awayso gaily to join his beefbarrels and his brandycasks and then tothink of my five hundred beautiful hussars without their

countryseemed deserted which is not to be wondered at when you think that thefrench the english and the guerillas had each in turn had command overit</s>  so bleak and wild was it one great brown wrinkled cliff succeedinganother and the pass growing narrower and narrower that i ceased tolook out but sat in silence thinking of this and that of women whom ihad loved and of horses which i had handled</s>  i was suddenly brought backfrom my dreams however by observing the difficulties of my companionwho was trying with a sort of bradawl which he had drawn out to borea hole through the leathern strap which held up his waterflask</s>  as heworked with twitching fingers the strap escaped his grasp and thewooden bottle fell at my feet</s>  i stooped to pick it up and as i did sothe priest silently leaped upon my shoulders and drove his bradawl intomy eye</s> my friends i am as you know a man steeled to face every danger</s>
 it mayconsole some of you when your own nerves play you tricks to rememberthat you have heard even me brigadier gerard say that i have beenscared</s>  and besides my terror at this horrible attack and the maddeningpain of my wound there was a sudden feeling of loathing such as youmight feel were some filthy tarantula to strike its fangs into you</s> i clutched the creature in both hands and hurling him on to the floorof the coach i stamped on him with my heavy boots</s>  he had drawn apistol from the front of his soutane but i kicked it out of his handand again i fell with my knees upon his chest</s>  then for the first timehe screamed horribly while i half blinded felt about for the swordwhich he had so cunningly concealed</s>  my hand had just lighted upon itand i was dashing the blood from my face to see where he lay that imight transfix him when the whole coach turned partly over upon itsside and my weapon was jerked out of my grasp by the shock</s> before i could recover myself the door was burst open and i wasdragged by the heels on to the road</s>  but even as i was torn out on tothe flint stones and realized that thirty ruffians were standing aroundme i was filled with joy for my pelisse had been pulled over my headin the struggle and was covering one of my eyes and it was with mywounded eye that i was seeing this gang of brigands</s>  you see foryourself by this pucker and scar how the thin blade passed betweensocket and ball but it was only at that moment when i was dragged fromthe coach that i understood that my sight was not gone for ever</s>  thecreatures intention doubtless was to drive it through into my brainand indeed he loosened some portion of the inner bone of my head sothat i afterwards had more trouble from that wound than from any one ofthe seventeen which i have received</s> they dragged me out these sons of dogs with curses and execrationsbeating me with their fists and kicking me as i lay upon the ground</s>  ihad frequently observed that the mountaineers wore cloth swathed roundtheir feet but never did i imagine that i should have so much cause tobe thankful for it</s>  presently seeing the blood upon my head and that ilay quiet they thought that i was unconscious whereas i was storingevery ugly face among them into my memory so that i might see them allsafely hanged if ever my chance came round</s>  brawny rascals they werewith yellow handkerchiefs round their heads and great red sashesstuffed with weapons</s>  they had rolled two rocks across the path whereit took a sharp turn and it was these which had torn off one of thewheels of the coach and upset us</s>  as to this reptile who had acted thepriest so cleverly and had told me so much of his parish and his motherhe of course had known where the ambuscade was laid and had attemptedto put me beyond all resistance at the moment when we reached it</s> i cannot tell you how frantic their rage was when they drew him out ofthe coach and saw the state to which i had reduced him</s>  if he had notgot all his deserts he had at least something as a souvenir of hismeeting with etienne gerard for his legs dangled aimlessly about andthough the upper part of his body was convulsed with rage and pain hesat straight down upon his feet when they tried to set him upright</s>  butall the time his two little black eyes which had seemed so kindly andso innocent in the coach were glaring at me like a wounded cat and hespat and spat and spat in my direction</s>  my faith</s>  when the wretchesjerked me on to my feet again and when i was dragged off up one of themountain paths i understood that a time was coming when i was to needall my courage and resource</s>  my enemy was carried upon the shoulders oftwo men behind me and i could hear his hissing and his reviling firstin one ear and then in the other as i was hurried up the winding track</s> i suppose that it must have been for an hour that we ascended and whatwith my wounded ankle and the pain from my eye and the fear lest thiswound should have spoiled my appearance i have made no journey to whichi look back with less pleasure</s>  i have never been a good climber at anytime but it is astonishing what you can do even with a stiff anklewhen you have a coppercoloured brigand at each elbow and a nineinchblade within touch of your whiskers</s> we came at last to a place where the path wound over a ridge anddescended upon the other side through thick pinetrees into a valleywhich opened to the south</s>  in time of peace i had little doubt that thevillains were all smugglers and that these were the secret paths bywhich they crossed the portuguese frontier</s>  there were many muletracksand once i was surprised to see the marks of a large horse where astream had softened the track</s>  these were explained when on reaching aplace where there was a clearing in the fir wood i saw the animalitself haltered to a fallen tree</s>  my eyes had hardly rested upon itwhen i recognized the great black limbs and the white near foreleg</s>  itwas the very horse which i had begged for in the morning</s> what then had become of commissariat vidal</s>  was it possible thatthere was another frenchman in as perilous a plight as myself</s>  thethought had hardly entered my head when our party stopped and one ofthem uttered a peculiar cry</s>  it was answered from among the brambleswhich lined the base of a cliff at one side of a clearing and aninstant later ten or a dozen more brigands came out from amongst themand the two parties greeted each other</s>  the newcomers surrounded myfriend of the bradawl with cries of grief and sympathy and thenturning upon me they brandished their knives and howled at me like thegang of assassins that they were</s>  so frantic were their gestures that iwas convinced that my end had come and was just bracing myself to meetit in a manner which should be worthy of my past reputation when one ofthem gave an order and i was dragged roughly across the little glade tothe brambles from which this new band had emerged</s> a narrow pathway led through them to a deep grotto in the side of thecliff</s>  the sun was already setting outside and in the cave itself itwould have been quite dark but for a pair of torches which blazed from asocket on either side</s>  between them there was sitting at a rude table avery singularlooking person whom i saw instantly from the respectwith which the others addressed him could be none other than thebrigand chief who had received on account of his dreadful characterthe sinister name of el cuchillo</s> the man whom i had injured had been carried in and placed upon the topof a barrel his helpless legs dangling about in front of him and hiscats eyes still darting glances of hatred at me</s>  i understood from thesnatches of talk which i could follow between the chief and him that hewas the lieutenant of the band and that part of his duties was to liein wait with his smooth tongue and his peaceful garb for travellers likemyself</s>  when i thought of how many gallant officers may have been luredto their death by this monster of hypocrisy it gave me a glow ofpleasure to think that i had brought his villainies to an endthough ifeared it would be at the price of a life which neither the emperor northe army could well spare</s> as the injured man still supported upon the barrel by two comrades wasexplaining in spanish all that had befallen him i was held by severalof the villains in front of the table at which the chief was seated andhad an excellent opportunity of observing him</s>  i have seldom seen anyman who was less like my idea of a brigand and especially of a brigandwith such a reputation that in a land of cruelty he had earned so dark anickname</s>  his face was bluff and broad and bland with ruddy cheeks andcomfortable little tufts of sidewhiskers which gave him the appearanceof a welltodo grocer of the rue st antoine</s>  he had not any of thoseflaring sashes or gleaming weapons which distinguished his followersbut on the contrary he wore a good broadcloth coat like a respectablefather of a family and save for his brown leggings there was nothing toindicate a life among the mountains</s>  his surroundings too correspondedwith himself and beside his snuffbox upon the table there stood agreat brown book which looked like a commercial ledger</s>  many otherbooks were ranged along a plank between two powdercasks and there wasa great litter of papers some of which had verses scribbled upon them</s> all this i took in while he leaning indolently back in his chair waslistening to the report of his lieutenant</s>  having heard everything heordered the cripple to be carried out again and i was left with mythree guards waiting to hear my fate</s>  he took up his pen and tappinghis forehead with the handle of it he pursed up his lips and looked outof the corner of his eyes at the roof of the grotto</s> i suppose said he at last speaking very excellent french that youare not able to suggest a rhyme for the word covilha</s>
i answered him that my acquaintance with the spanish language was solimited that i was unable to oblige him</s> it is a rich language said he but less prolific in rhymes thaneither the german or the english</s>
 that is why our best work has beendone in blank verse a form of composition which is capable of reachinggreat heights</s>  but i fear that such subjects are somewhat outside therange of a hussar</s> i was about to answer that if they were good enough for a guerilla theycould not be too much for the light cavalry but he was already stoopingover his halffinished verse</s>  presently he threw down the pen with anexclamation of satisfaction and declaimed a few lines which drew a cryof approval from the three ruffians who held me</s>  his broad face blushedlike a young girl who receives her first compliment</s> the critics are in my favour it appears said he we amuse ourselvesin our long evenings by singing our own ballads you understand</s>  i havesome little facility in that direction and i do not at all despair ofseeing some of my poor efforts in print before long and with madridupon the titlepage too</s>  but we must get back to business</s>
etienne gerard</s> rank</s> colonel</s> corps</s> the third hussars of conflans</s> you are young for a colonel</s> my career has been an eventful one</s> tut that makes it the sadder said he with his bland smile</s> i made no answer to that but i tried to show him by my bearing that iwas ready for the worst which could befall me</s> by the way i rather fancy that we have had some of your corps heresaid he turning over the pages of his big brown register</s>  weendeavour to keep a record of our operations</s>  here is a heading underjune 24th</s>  have you not a young officer named soubiron a tall slightyouth with light hair</s> certainly</s> i see that we buried him upon that date</s> poor lad</s>  i cried</s>
we buried him</s> but before you buried him</s> you misunderstand me colonel</s>  he was not dead before we buried him</s>
you buried him alive</s> for a moment i was too stunned to act</s>  then i hurled myself upon theman as he sat with that placid smile of his upon his lips and i wouldhave torn his throat out had the three wretches not dragged me away fromhim</s>  again and again i made for him panting and cursing shaking offthis man and that straining and wrenching but never quite free</s>  atlast with my jacket torn nearly off my back and blood dripping from mywrists i was hauled backwards in the bight of a rope and cords passedround my ankles and my arms</s> you sleek hound</s>  i cried</s>  if ever i have you at my swords point iwill teach you to maltreat one of my lads</s>  you will find youbloodthirsty beast that my emperor has long arms and though you liehere like a rat in its hole the time will come when he will tear youout of it and you and your vermin will perish together</s> my faith i have a rough side to my tongue and there was not a hardword that i had learned in fourteen campaigns which i did not let fly athim but he sat with the handle of his pen tapping against his foreheadand his eyes squinting up at the roof as if he had conceived the idea ofsome new stanza</s>  it was this occupation of his which showed me how imight get my point into him</s> you spawn</s>  said i you think that you are safe here but your lifemay be as short as that of your absurd verses and god knows that itcould not be shorter than that</s> ah you should have seen him bound from his chair when i said the words</s> this vile monster who dispensed death and torture as a grocer servesout his figs had one raw nerve then which i could prod at pleasure</s>  hisface grew livid and those little bourgeois sidewhiskers quivered andthrilled with passion</s> very good colonel</s>  you have said enough he cried in a chokingvoice</s>  you say that you have had a very distinguished career</s>  i promiseyou also a very distinguished ending</s>  colonel etienne gerard of thethird hussars shall have a death of his own</s> and i only beg said i that you will not commemorate it in verse</s>  ihad one or two little ironies to utter but he cut me short by a furiousgesture which caused my three guards to drag me from the cave</s> our interview which i have told you as nearly as i can remember itmust have lasted some time for it was quite dark when we came out andthe moon was shining very clearly in the heavens</s>  the brigands hadlighted a great fire of the dried branches of the firtrees not ofcourse for warmth since the night was already very sultry but to cooktheir evening meal</s>  a huge copper pot hung over the blaze and therascals were lying all round in the yellow glare so that the scenelooked like one of those pictures which junot stole out of madrid</s>  thereare some soldiers who profess to care nothing for art and the like buti have always been drawn towards it myself in which respect i show mygood taste and my breeding</s>  i remember for example that when lefebvrewas selling the plunder after the fall of danzig i bought a very finepicture called nymphs surprised in a wood and i carried it with methrough two campaigns until my charger had the misfortune to put hishoof through it</s> i only tell you this however to show you that i was never a mererough soldier like rapp or ney</s>  as i lay in that brigands camp i hadlittle time or inclination to think about such matters</s>  they had thrownme down under a tree the three villains squatting round and smokingtheir cigarettes within hands touch of me</s>  what to do i could notimagine</s>  in my whole career i do not suppose that i have ten times beenin as hopeless a situation</s>  but courage thought i</s>  courage my braveboy</s>  you were not made a colonel of hussars at twentyeight because youcould dance a cotillon</s>  you are a picked man etienne a man who hascome through more than two hundred affairs and this little one issurely not going to be the last</s>  i began eagerly to glance about forsome chance of escape and as i did so i saw something which filled mewith great astonishment</s> i have already told you that a large fire was burning in the centre ofthe glade</s>  what with its glare and what with the moonlight everythingwas as clear as possible</s>  on the other side of the glade there was asingle tall firtree which attracted my attention because its trunk andlower branches were discoloured as if a large fire had recently beenlit underneath it</s>  a clump of bushes grew in front of it which concealedthe base</s>  well as i looked towards it i was surprised to seeprojecting above the bush and fastened apparently to the tree a pairof fine riding boots with the toes upwards</s>  at first i thought that theywere tied there but as i looked harder i saw that they were secured bya great nail which was hammered through the foot of each</s>  and thensuddenly with a thrill of horror i understood that these were notempty boots and moving my head a little to the right i was able to seewho it was that had been fastened there and why a fire had been litbeneath the tree</s>  it is not pleasant to speak or to think of horrors myfriends and i do not wish to give any of you bad dreams tonightbut icannot take you among the spanish guerillas without showing you whatkind of men they were and the sort of warfare that they waged</s>  i willonly say that i understood why monsieur vidals horse was waitingmasterless in the grove and that i hoped he had met this terrible fatewith sprightliness and courage as a good frenchman ought</s> it was not a very cheering sight for me as you can imagine</s>  when i hadbeen with their chief in the grotto i had been so carried away by myrage at the cruel death of young soubiron who was one of the brightestlads who ever threw his thigh over a charger that i had never given athought to my own position</s>  perhaps it would have been more politic hadi spoken the ruffian fair but it was too late now</s>  the cork was drawnand i must drain the wine</s>  besides if the harmless commissariat manwere put to such a death what hope was there for me who had snappedthe spine of their lieutenant</s>  no i was doomed in any case and it wasas well perhaps that i should have put the best face on the matter</s>  thisbeast could bear witness that etienne gerard had died as he had livedand that one prisoner at least had not quailed before him</s>  i lay therethinking of the various girls who would mourn for me and of my dear oldmother and of the deplorable loss which i should be both to myregiment and to the emperor and i am not ashamed to confess to you thati shed tears as i thought of the general consternation which mypremature end would give rise to</s> but all the time i was taking the very keenest notice of everythingwhich might possibly help me</s>  i am not a man who would lie like a sickhorse waiting for the farrier sergeant and the poleaxe</s>  first i wouldgive a little tug at my ankle cords and then another at those whichwere round my wrists and all the time that i was trying to loosen themi was peering round to see if i could find something which was in myfavour</s>  there was one thing which was very evident</s>  a hussar is but halfformed without a horse and there was my other half quietly grazingwithin thirty yards of me</s>  then i observed yet another thing</s>  the pathby which we had come over the mountains was so steep that a horse couldonly be led across it slowly and with difficulty but in the otherdirection the ground appeared to be more open and to lead straight downinto a gentlysloping valley</s>  had i but my feet in yonder stirrups andmy sabre in my hand a single bold dash might take me out of the powerof these vermin of the rocks</s> i was still thinking it over and straining with my wrists and my ankleswhen their chief came out from his grotto and after some talk with hislieutenant who lay groaning near the fire they both nodded their headsand looked across at me</s>  he then said some few words to the band whoclapped their hands and laughed uproariously</s>  things looked ominous andi was delighted to feel that my hands were so far free that i couldeasily slip them through the cords if i wished</s>  but with my ankles ifeared that i could do nothing for when i strained it brought such paininto my lancewound that i had to gnaw my moustache to keep from cryingout</s>  i could only lie still halffree and halfbound and see what turnthings were likely to take</s> for a little i could not make out what they were after</s>  one of therascals climbed up a wellgrown firtree upon one side of the glade andtied a rope round the top of the trunk</s>  he then fastened another rope inthe same fashion to a similar tree upon the other side</s>  the two looseends were now dangling down and i waited with some curiosity and justa little trepidation also to see what they would do next</s>  the wholeband pulled upon one of the ropes until they had bent the strong youngtree down into a semicircle and they then fastened it to a stump soas to hold it so</s>  when they had bent the other tree down in a similarfashion the two summits were within a few feet of each other thoughas you understand they would each spring back into their originalposition the instant that they were released</s>  i already saw thediabolical plan which these miscreants had formed</s> i presume that you are a strong man colonel said the chief comingtowards me with his hateful smile</s> if you will have the kindness to loosen these cords i answered iwill show you how strong i am</s> we were all interested to see whether you were as strong as these twoyoung saplings said he</s>  it is our intention you see to tie one endof each rope round your ankles and then let the trees go</s>  if you arestronger than the trees then of course no harm would be done if onthe other hand the trees are stronger than you why in that casecolonel we may have a souvenir of you upon each side of our littleglade</s> he laughed as he spoke and at the sight of it the whole forty of themlaughed also</s>  even now if i am in my darker humour or if i have a touchof my old lithuanian ague i see in my sleep that ring of dark savagefaces with their cruel eyes and the firelight flashing upon theirstrong white teeth</s> it is astonishingand i have heard many make the same remarkhow acuteones senses become at such a crisis as this</s>  i am convinced that at nomoment is one living so vividly so acutely as at the instant when aviolent and foreseen death overtakes one</s>  i could smell the resinousfagots i could see every twig upon the ground i could hear everyrustle of the branches as i have never smelled or seen or heard save atsuch times of danger</s>  and so it was that long before anyone else beforeeven the time when the chief had addressed me i had heard a lowmonotonous sound far away indeed and yet coming nearer at everyinstant</s>  at first it was but a murmur a rumble but by the time he hadfinished speaking while the assassins were untying my ankles in orderto lead me to the scene of my murder i heard as plainly as ever iheard anything in my life the clinking of horseshoes and the jinglingof bridlechains with the clank of sabres against stirrupirons</s>  is itlikely that i who had lived with the light cavalry since the first hairshaded my lip would mistake the sound of troopers on the march</s> help comrades help</s>  i shrieked and though they struck me acrossthe mouth and tried to drag me up to the trees i kept on yelling helpme my brave boys</s>  help me my children</s>  they are murdering yourcolonel</s> for the moment my wounds and my troubles had brought on a delirium andi looked for nothing less than my five hundred hussars kettledrums andall to appear at the opening of the glade</s> but that which really appeared was very different to anything which ihad conceived</s>  into the clear space there came galloping a fine youngman upon a most beautiful roan horse</s>  he was freshfaced andpleasantlooking with the most debonair bearing in the world and themost gallant way of carrying himselfa way which reminded me somewhatof my own</s>  he wore a singular coat which had once been red all over butwhich was now stained to the colour of a withered oakleaf wherever theweather could reach it</s>  his shoulderstraps however were of goldenlace and he had a bright metal helmet upon his head with a coquettishwhite plume upon one side of its crest</s>  he trotted his horse up theglade while behind him rode four cavaliers in the same dressallcleanshaven with round comely faces looking to me more like monksthan dragoons</s>  at a short gruff order they halted with a rattle ofarms while their leader cantered forward the fire beating upon hiseager face and the beautiful head of his charger</s>  i knew of course bythe strange coats that they were english</s>  it was the first sight that ihad ever had of them but from their stout bearing and their masterfulway i could see at a glance that what i had always been told was trueand that they were excellent people to fight against</s> well well well</s>  cried the young officer in sufficiently bad frenchwhat game are you up to here</s>  who was that who was yelling for helpand what are you trying to do to him</s> it was at that moment that i learned to bless those months whichobriant the descendant of the irish kings had spent in teaching me thetongue of the english</s>  my ankles had just been freed so that i had onlyto slip my hands out of the cords and with a single rush i had flownacross picked up my sabre where it lay by the fire and hurled myselfon to the saddle of poor vidals horse</s>  yes for all my wounded ankle inever put foot to stirrup but was in the seat in a single bound</s>  i torethe halter from the tree and before these villains could so much assnap a pistol at me i was beside the english officer</s> i surrender to you sir i cried though i daresay my english was notvery much better than his french</s>  if you will look at that tree to theleft you will see what these villains do to the honourable gentlemen whofall into their hands</s> the fire had flared up at that moment and there was poor vidal exposedbefore them as horrible an object as one could see in a nightmare</s> godam</s>  cried the officer and godam</s>  cried each of the fourtroopers which is the same as with us when we cry mon dieu</s>  outrasped the five swords and the four men closed up</s>  one who wore asergeants chevrons laughed and clapped me on the shoulder</s> fight for your skin froggy said he</s> ah it was so fine to have a horse between my thighs and a weapon in mygrip</s>  i waved it above my head and shouted in my exultation</s>  the chiefhad come forward with that odious smiling face of his</s> your excellency will observe that this frenchman is our prisoner saidhe</s> you are a rascally robber said the englishman shaking his sword athim</s>  it is a disgrace to us to have such allies</s>  by my faith if lordwellington were of my mind we would swing you up on the nearest tree</s> but my prisoner</s>  said the brigand in his suave voice</s> he shall come with us to the british camp</s> just a word in your ear before you take him</s> he approached the young officer and then turning as quick as a flashhe fired his pistol in my face</s>  the bullet scored its way through myhair and burst a hole on each side of my busby</s>  seeing that he hadmissed me he raised the pistol and was about to hurl it at me when theenglish sergeant with a single backhanded cut nearly severed his headfrom his body</s>  his blood had not reached the ground nor the last cursedied on his lips before the whole horde was upon us but with a dozenbounds and as many slashes we were all safely out of the glade andgalloping down the winding track which led to the valley</s> it was not until we had left the ravine far behind us and were right outin the open fields that we ventured to halt and to see what injuries wehad sustained</s>  for me wounded and weary as i was my heart was beatingproudly and my chest was nearly bursting my tunic to think that ietienne gerard had left this gang of murderers so much by which toremember me</s>  my faith they would think twice before they ventured againto lay hands upon one of the third hussars</s>  so carried away was i that imade a small oration to these brave englishmen and told them who it wasthat they had helped to rescue</s>  i would have spoken of glory also andof the sympathies of brave men but the officer cut me short</s> thats all right said he</s>  any injuries sergeant</s> trooper joness horse hit with a pistol bullet on the fetlock</s> trooper jones to go with us</s>  sergeant halliday with troopers harveyand smith to keep to the right until they touch the vedettes of thegerman hussars</s> so these three jingled away together while the officer and i followedat some distance by the trooper whose horse had been wounded rodestraight down in the direction of the english camp</s>  very soon we hadopened our hearts for we each liked the other from the beginning</s>  hewas of the nobility this brave lad and he had been sent out scoutingby lord wellington to see if there were any signs of our advancingthrough the mountains</s>  it is one advantage of a wandering life likemine that you learn to pick up those bits of knowledge whichdistinguish the man of the world</s>
 i have for example hardly ever met afrenchman who could repeat an english title correctly</s>  if i had nottravelled i should not be able to say with confidence that this youngmans real name was milor the hon</s>  sir russell bart</s>  this last beingan honourable distinction so that it was as the bart that i usuallyaddressed him just as in spanish one might say the don</s>
as we rode beneath the moonlight in the lovely spanish night we spokeour minds to each other as if we were brothers</s>  we were both of an ageyou see both of the light cavalry also the sixteenth light dragoonswas his regiment and both with the same hopes and ambitions</s>  neverhave i learned to know a man so quickly as i did the bart</s>  he gave methe name of a girl whom he had loved at a garden called vauxhall andfor my own part i spoke to him of little coralie of the opera</s>  he tooka lock of hair from his bosom and i a garter</s>  then we nearly quarrelledover hussar and dragoon for he was absurdly proud of his regiment andyou should have seen him curl his lip and clap his hand to his hilt wheni said that i hoped it might never be its misfortune to come in the wayof the third</s>  finally he began to speak about what the english callsport and he told such stories of the money which he had lost overwhich of two cocks could kill the other or which of two men couldstrike the other the most in a fight for a prize that i was filled withastonishment</s>  he was ready to bet upon anything in the most wonderfulmanner and when i chanced to see a shooting star he was anxious to betthat he would see more than me twentyfive francs a star and it wasonly when i explained that my purse was in the hands of the brigandsthat he would give over the idea</s> well we chatted away in this very amiable fashion until the day beganto break when suddenly we heard a great volley of musketry fromsomewhere in front of us</s>  it was very rocky and broken ground and ithought although i could see nothing that a general engagement hadbroken out</s>  the bart laughed at my idea however and explained that thesound came from the english camp where every man emptied his piece eachmorning so as to make sure of having a dry priming</s> in another mile we shall be up with the outposts said he</s> i glanced round at this and i perceived that we had trotted along at sogood a pace during the time that we were keeping up our pleasant chatthat the dragoon with the lame horse was altogether out of sight</s>  ilooked on every side but in the whole of that vast rocky valley therewas no one save only the bart and iboth of us armed you understandand both of us well mounted</s>  i began to ask myself whether after all itwas quite necessary that i should ride that mile which would bring me tothe british outposts</s> now i wish to be very clear with you on this point my friends for iwould not have you think that i was acting dishonourably or ungratefullyto the man who had helped me away from the brigands</s>  you must rememberthat of all duties the strongest is that which a commanding officer owesto his men</s>  you must also bear in mind that war is a game which isplayed under fixed rules and when these rules are broken one must atonce claim the forfeit</s>  if for example i had given a parole then ishould have been an infamous wretch had i dreamed of escaping</s>  but noparole had been asked of me</s>  out of overconfidence and the chance ofthe lame horse dropping behind the bart had permitted me to get uponequal terms with him</s>  had it been i who had taken him i should haveused him as courteously as he had me but at the same time i shouldhave respected his enterprise so far as to have deprived him of hissword and seen that i had at least one guard beside myself</s>  i reinedup my horse and explained this to him asking him at the same timewhether he saw any breach of honour in my leaving him</s> he thought about it and several times repeated that which the englishsay when they mean mon dieu</s> you would give me the slip would you</s>  said he</s> if you can give no reason against it</s> the only reason that i can think of said the bart is that i shouldinstantly cut your head off if you were to attempt it</s> two can play at that game my dear bart said i</s> then well see who can play at it best he cried pulling out hissword</s> i had drawn mine also but i was quite determined not to hurt thisadmirable young man who had been my benefactor</s> consider said i you say that i am your prisoner</s>  i might with equalreason say that you are mine</s>  we are alone here and though i have nodoubt that you are an excellent swordsman you can hardly hope to holdyour own against the best blade in the six light

a verydashing leader but he ruined himself with wine and folly</s>  now ietienne gerard was always totally devoid of swagger and at the sametime i was very abstemious except maybe at the end of a campaign orwhen i met an old comradeinarms</s>  for these reasons i might perhapshad it not been for a certain diffidence have claimed to be the mostvaluable officer in my own branch of the service</s>  it is true that inever rose to be more than a chief of brigade but then as everyoneknows no one had a chance of rising to the top unless he had the goodfortune to be with the emperor in his early campaigns</s>  except lasalleand labau and drouet i can hardly remember any one of the generals whohad not already made his name before the egyptian business</s>  even i withall my brilliant qualities could only attain the head of my brigadeand also the special medal of honour which i received from the emperorhimself and which i keep at home in a leathern pouch</s> but though i never rose higher than this my qualities were very wellknown to those who had served with me and also to the english</s>  afterthey had captured me in the way which i described to you the othernight they kept a very good guard over me at oporto and i promise youthat they did not give such a formidable opponent a chance of slippingthrough their fingers</s>  it was on the 10th of august that i was escortedon board the transport which was to take us to england and behold mebefore the end of the month in the great prison which had been built forus at dartmoor</s> lhtel franais et pension we used to call it for you understandthat we were all brave men there and that we did not lose our spiritsbecause we were in adversity</s> it was only those officers who refused to give their parole who wereconfined at dartmoor and most of the prisoners were seamen or from theranks</s>  you ask me perhaps why it was that i did not give this paroleand so enjoy the same good treatment as most of my brother officers</s> well i had two reasons and both of them were sufficiently strong</s> in the first place i had so much confidence in myself that i was quiteconvinced that i could escape</s>  in the second my family though of goodrepute has never been wealthy and i could not bring myself to takeanything from the small income of my mother</s>  on the other hand it wouldnever do for a man like me to be outshone by the bourgeois society of anenglish country town or to be without the means of showing courtesiesand attentions to those ladies whom i should attract</s>  it was for thesereasons that i preferred to be buried in the dreadful prison ofdartmoor</s>  i wish now to tell you of my adventures in england and howfar milor wellingtons words were true when he said that his king wouldhold me</s> and first of all i may say that if it were not that i have set off totell you about what befell myself i could keep you here until morningwith my stories about dartmoor itself and about the singular thingswhich occurred there</s>  it was one of the very strangest places in thewhole world for there in the middle of that great desolate waste wereherded together seven or eight thousand menwarriors you understandmen of experience and courage</s>  around there were a double wall and aditch and warders and soldiers but my faith</s>  you could not coop menlike that up like rabbits in a hutch</s>  they would escape by twos and tensand twenties and then the cannon would boom and the search partiesrun and we who were left behind would laugh and dance and shoutvive lempereur until the warders would turn their muskets upon us intheir passion</s>  and then we would have our little mutinies too and upwould come the infantry and the guns from plymouth and that would setus yelling vive lempereur once more as though we wished them to hearus in paris</s>  we had lively moments at dartmoor and we contrived thatthose who were about us should be lively also</s> you must know that the prisoners there had their own courts of justicein which they tried their own cases and inflicted their ownpunishments</s>  stealing and quarrelling were punishedbut most of alltreachery</s>  when i came there first there was a man meunier fromrheims who had given information of some plot to escape</s>  well thatnight owing to some form or other which had to be gone through theydid not take him out from among the other prisoners and though he weptand screamed and grovelled upon the ground they left him there amongstthe comrades whom he had betrayed</s>  that night there was a trial with awhispered accusation and a whispered defence a gagged prisoner and ajudge whom none could see</s>  in the morning when they came for their manwith papers for his release there was not as much of him left as youcould put upon your thumbnail</s>  they were ingenious people theseprisoners and they had their own way of managing</s> we officers however lived in a separate wing and a very singulargroup of people we were</s>  they had left us our uniforms so that therewas hardly a corps which had served under victor or massena or neywhich was not represented there and some had been there from the timewhen junot was beaten at vimiera</s>  we had chasseurs in their greentunics and hussars like myself and bluecoated dragoons andwhitefronted lancers and voltigeurs and grenadiers and the men ofthe artillery and engineers</s>  but the greater part were naval officersfor the english had had the better of us upon the seas</s>  i could neverunderstand this until i journeyed myself from oporto to plymouth wheni lay for seven days upon my back and could not have stirred had i seenthe eagle of the regiment carried off before my eyes</s>  it was inperfidious weather like this that nelson took advantage of us</s> i had no sooner got into dartmoor than i began to plan to get out againand you can readily believe that with wits sharpened by twelve years ofwarfare it was not very long before i saw my way</s> you must know in the first place that i had a very great advantage inhaving some knowledge of the english language</s>  i learned it during themonths that i spent before danzig from adjutant obriant of theregiment irlandais who was sprung from the ancient kings of thecountry</s>  i was quickly able to speak it with some facility for i do nottake long to master anything to which i set my mind</s>  in three months icould not only express my meaning but i could use the idioms of thepeople</s>  it was obriant who taught me to say be jabers just as wemight say ma foi and also the curse of crummle</s>
 many a time i have seen the english smile with pleasure when theyhave heard me speak so much like one of themselves</s> we officers were put two in a cell which was very little to my tastefor my roommate was a tall silent man named beaumont of the flyingartillery who had been taken by the english cavalry at astorga</s> it is seldom i meet a man of whom i cannot make a friend for mydisposition and manners areas you know them</s>  but this fellow had nevera smile for my jests nor an ear for my sorrows but would sit lookingat me with his sullen eyes until sometimes i thought that his two yearsof captivity had driven him crazy</s>  ah how i longed that old bouvet orany of my comrades of the hussars was there instead of this mummy of aman</s>  but such as he was i had to make the best of him and it was veryevident that no escape could be made unless he were my partner in itfor what could i possibly do without him observing me</s>  i hinted at ittherefore and then by degrees i spoke more plainly until it seemed tome that i had prevailed upon him to share my lot</s> i tried the walls and i tried the floor and i tried the ceiling butthough i tapped and probed they all appeared to be very thick andsolid</s>  the door was of iron shutting with a spring lock and providedwith a small grating through which a warder looked twice in everynight</s>  within there were two beds two stools two washstandsnothingmore</s>  it was enough for my wants for when had i had as much duringthose twelve years spent in camps</s>  but how was i to get out</s>  night afternight i thought of my five hundred hussars and had dreadful nightmaresin which i fancied that the whole regiment needed shoeing or that myhorses were all bloated with green fodder or that they were founderedfrom bogland or that six squadrons were clubbed in the presence of theemperor</s>  then i would awake in a cold sweat and set to work picking andtapping at the walls once more for i knew very well that there is nodifficulty which cannot be overcome by a ready brain and a pair ofcunning hands</s> there was a single window in our cell which was too small to admit achild</s>  it was further defended by a thick iron bar in the centre</s>  it wasnot a very promising point of escape as you will allow but i becamemore and more convinced that our efforts must be directed towards it</s>  tomake matters worse it only led out into the exercise yard which wassurrounded by two high walls</s>  still as i said to my sullen comrade itis time to talk of the vistula when you are over the rhine</s>  i got asmall piece of iron therefore from the fittings of my bed and i setto work to loosen the plaster at the top and the bottom of the bar</s> three hours i would work and then leap into my bed upon the sound ofthe warders step</s>  then another three hours and then very often anotheryet for i found that beaumont was so slow and clumsy at it that it wason myself only that i could rely</s> i pictured to myself my third of hussars waiting just outside thatwindow with kettledrums and standards and leopardskin schabraques allcomplete</s>  then i would work like a madman until my iron was crustedwith blood as if with rust</s>  and so night by night i loosened thatstony plaster and hid it away in the stuffing of my pillow until thehour came when the iron shook and then with one good wrench it came offin my hand and my first step had been made towards freedom</s> you will ask me what better off i was since as i have said a childcould not have fitted through the opening</s>  i will tell you</s>  i had gainedtwo thingsa tool and a weapon</s>  with the one i might loosen the stonewhich flanked the window</s>  with the other i might defend myself when ihad scrambled through</s>  so now i turned my attention to that stone and ipicked and picked with the sharpened end of my bar until i had workedout the mortar all round</s>  you understand of course that during the dayi replaced everything in its position and that the warder was neverpermitted to see a speck upon the floor</s>  at the end of three weeks i hadseparated the stone and had the rapture of drawing it through andseeing a hole left with ten stars shining through it where there hadbeen but four before</s>  all was ready for us now and i had replaced thestone smearing the edges of it round with a little fat and soot so asto hide the cracks where the mortar should have been</s>  in three nightsthe moon would be gone and that seemed the best time for our attempt</s> i had now no doubt at all about getting into the yards but i had veryconsiderable misgivings as to how i was to get out again</s>  it would betoo humiliating after trying here and trying there to have to go backto my hole again in despair or to be arrested by the guards outsideand thrown into those damp underground cells which are reserved forprisoners who are caught in escaping</s>  i set to work therefore to planwhat i should do</s>  i have never as you know had the chance of showingwhat i could do as a general</s>  sometimes after a glass or two of wine ihave found myself capable of thinking out surprising combinations andhave felt that if napoleon had intrusted me with an army corps thingsmight have gone differently with him</s>  but however that may be there isno doubt that in the small stratagems of war and in that quickness ofinvention which is so necessary for an officer of light cavalry i couldhold my own against anyone</s>  it was now that i had need of it and i feltsure that it would not fail me</s> the inner wall which i had to scale was built of bricks 12ft</s>  highwith a row of iron spikes 3in</s>  apart upon the top</s>  the outer i had onlycaught a glimpse of once or twice when the gate of the exercise yardwas open</s>  it appeared to be about the same height and was also spikedat the top</s>  the space between the walls was over twenty feet and i hadreason to believe that there were no sentries there except at thegates</s>  on the other hand i knew that there was a line of soldiersoutside</s>  behold the little nut my friends which i had to open with nocrackers save these two hands</s> one thing upon which i relied was the height of my comrade beaumont</s>  ihave already said that he was a very tall man six feet at least and itseemed to me that if i could mount upon his shoulders and get my handsupon the spikes i could easily scale the wall</s>  could i pull my bigcompanion up after me</s>  that was the question for when i set forth witha comrade even though it be one for whom i bear no affection nothingon earth would make me abandon him</s>  if i climbed the wall and he couldnot follow me i should be compelled to return to him</s>  he did not seemto concern himself much about it however so i hoped that he hadconfidence in his own activity</s> then another very important matter was the choice of the sentry whoshould be on duty in front of my window at the time of our attempt</s> they were changed every two hours to insure their vigilance but i whowatched them closely each night out of my window knew that there was agreat difference between them</s>  there were some who were so keen that arat could not cross the yard unseen while others thought only of theirown ease and could sleep as soundly leaning upon a musket as if theywere at home upon a feather bed</s>  there was one especially a fat heavyman who would retire into the shadow of the wall and doze socomfortably during his two hours that i have dropped pieces of plasterfrom my window at his very feet without his observing it</s>  by good luckthis fellows watch was due from twelve to two upon the night which wehad fixed upon for our enterprise</s> as the last day passed i was so filled with nervous agitation that icould not control myself but ran ceaselessly about my cell like amouse in a cage</s>  every moment i thought that the warder would detect thelooseness of the bar or that the sentry would observe the unmortaredstone which i could not conceal outside as i did within</s>  as for mycompanion he sat brooding upon the end of his bed looking at me in asidelong fashion from time to time and biting his nails like one who isdeep in thought</s> courage my friend</s>  i cried slapping him upon the shoulder</s>  you willsee your guns before another month be past</s> that is very well said he</s>  but whither will you fly when you getfree</s> to the coast i answered</s>  all comes right for a brave man and ishall make straight for my regiment</s> you are more likely to make straight for the underground cells or forthe portsmouth hulks said he</s> a soldier takes his chances i remarked</s>  it is only the poltroon whoreckons always upon the worst</s> i raised a flush in each of his sallow cheeks at that and i was gladof it for it was the first sign of spirit which i had ever observed inhim</s>  for a moment he put his hand out towards his waterjug as thoughhe would have hurled it at me but then he shrugged his shoulders andsat in silence once more biting his nails and scowling down at thefloor</s>  i could not but think as i looked at him that perhaps i wasdoing the flying artillery a very bad service by bringing him back tothem</s> i never in my life have known an evening pass as slowly as that one</s> towards nightfall a wind sprang up and as the darkness deepened it blewharder and harder until a terrible gale was whistling over the moor</s>
 the rain was pouringdown and what with its hissing and splashing and the howling andscreaming of the wind it was impossible for me to hear the steps of thesentinels</s>  if i cannot hear them thought i then it is unlikely thatthey can hear me and i waited with the utmost impatience until thetime when the inspector should have come round for his nightly peepthrough our grating</s>  then having peered through the darkness and seennothing of the sentry who was doubtless crouching in some corner out ofthe rain i felt that the moment was come</s>
 i removed the bar pulled outthe stone and motioned to my companion to pass through</s> after you colonel said he</s> will you not go first</s>  i asked</s> i had rather you showed me the way</s> come after me then but come silently as you value your life</s> in the darkness i could hear the fellows teeth chattering and iwondered whether a man ever had such a partner in a desperateenterprise</s>  i seized the bar however and mounting upon my stool ithrust my head and shoulders into the hole</s>  i had wriggled through asfar as my waist when my companion seized me suddenly by the knees andyelled at the top of his voice help</s>  help</s>  a prisoner is escaping</s> ah my friends what did i not feel at that moment</s>  of course i saw inan instant the game of this vile creature</s>  why should he risk his skinin climbing walls when he might be sure of a free pardon from theenglish for having prevented the escape of one so much moredistinguished than himself</s>  i had recognized him as a poltroon and asneak but i had not understood the depth of baseness to which he coulddescend</s>  one who has spent his life among gentlemen and men of honourdoes not think of such things until they happen</s> the blockhead did not seem to understand that he was lost more certainlythan i</s>  i writhed back in the darkness and seizing him by the throat istruck him twice with my iron bar</s>  at the first blow he yelped as alittle cur does when you tread upon its paw</s>  at the second down he fellwith a groan upon the floor</s>  then i seated myself upon my bed andwaited resignedly for whatever punishment my gaolers might inflict uponme</s> but a minute passed and yet another with no sound save the heavysnoring breathing of the senseless wretch upon the floor</s>  was itpossible then that amid the fury of the storm his warning cries hadpassed unheeded</s>  at first it was but a tiny hope another minute and itwas probable another and it was certain</s>  there was no sound in thecorridor none in the courtyard</s>  i wiped the cold sweat from my browand asked myself what i should do next</s> one thing seemed certain</s>  the man on the floor must die</s>  if i left him icould not tell how short a time it might be before he gave the alarm</s>  idare not strike a light so i felt about in the darkness until my handcame upon something wet which i knew to be his head</s>  i raised my ironbar but there was something my friends which prevented me frombringing it down</s>  in the heat of fight i have slain many menmen ofhonour too who had done me no injury</s>  yet here was this wretch acreature too foul to live who had tried to work me so great a mischiefand yet i could not bring myself to crush his skull in</s>  such deeds arevery well for a spanish partidaor for that matter a sansculotte of thefaubourg st antoinebut not for a soldier and a gentleman like me</s> however the heavy breathing of the fellow made me hope that it might bea very long time before he recovered his senses</s>  i gagged himtherefore and bound him with strips of blanket to the bed so that inhis weakened condition there was good reason to think that in any casehe might not get free before the next visit of the warder</s>  but now againi was faced with new difficulties for you will remember that i hadrelied upon his height to help me over the walls</s>  i could have sat downand shed tears of despair had not the thought of my mother and of theemperor come to sustain me</s>  courage</s>  said i</s>  if it were anyone butetienne gerard he would be in a bad fix now that is a young man who isnot so easily caught</s> i set to work therefore upon beaumonts sheet as well as my own and bytearing them into strips and then plaiting them together i made a veryexcellent rope</s>  this i tied securely to the centre of my iron bar whichwas a little over a foot in length</s>
 ikept in the shadow of the prison wall but it was as black as the ace ofspades and i could not see my own hand in front of me</s>  unless i walkedinto the sentinel i felt that i had nothing to fear from him</s>  when i hadcome under the wall i threw up my bar and to my joy it stuck the veryfirst time between the spikes at the top</s>  i climbed up my rope pulledit after me and dropped down on the other side</s>  then i scaled thesecond wall and was sitting astride among the spikes upon the top wheni saw something twinkle in the darkness beneath me</s>  it was the bayonetof the sentinel below and so close was it the second wall being ratherlower than the first that i could easily by leaning over haveunscrewed it from its socket</s>  there he was humming a tune to himselfand cuddling up against the wall to keep himself warm little thinkingthat a desperate man within a few feet of him was within an ace ofstabbing him to the heart with his own weapon</s>  i was already bracingmyself for the spring when the fellow with an oath shouldered hismusket and i heard his steps squelching through the mud as he resumedhis beat</s>  i slipped down my rope and leaving it hanging i ran at thetop of my speed across the moor</s> heavens how i ran</s>  the wind buffeted my face and buzzed in my nostrils</s> the rain pringled upon my skin and hissed past my ears</s>  i stumbled intoholes</s>  i tripped over bushes</s>  i fell among brambles</s>  i was torn andbreathless and bleeding</s>  my tongue was like leather my feet like leadand my heart beating like a kettledrum</s>  still i ran and i ran and iran</s> but i had not lost my head my friends</s>  everything was done with apurpose</s>  our fugitives always made for the coast</s>  i was determined to goinland and the more so as i had told beaumont the opposite</s>  i would flyto the north and they would seek me in the south</s>  perhaps you will askme how i could tell which was which on such a night</s>  i answer that itwas by the wind</s>  i had observed in the prison that it came from thenorth and so as long as i kept my face to it i was going in the rightdirection</s> well i was rushing along in this fashion when suddenly i saw twoyellow lights shining out of the darkness in front of me</s>  i paused for amoment uncertain what i should do</s>  i was still in my hussar uniformyou understand and it seemed to me that the very first thing that ishould aim at was to get some dress which should not betray me</s>  if theselights came from a cottage it was probable enough that i might findwhat i wanted there</s>  i approached therefore feeling very sorry that ihad left my iron bar behind for i was determined to fight to the deathbefore i should be retaken</s> but very soon i found that there was no cottage there</s>  the lights weretwo lamps hung upon each side of a carriage and by their glare i sawthat a broad road lay in front of me</s>  crouching among the bushes iobserved that there were two horses to the equipage that a smallpostboy was standing at their heads and that one of the wheels waslying in the road beside him</s>  i can see them now my friends thesteaming creatures the stunted lad with his hands to their bits andthe big black coach all shining with the rain and balanced upon itsthree wheels</s>  as i looked the window was lowered and a pretty littleface under a bonnet peeped out from it</s> what shall i do</s>  the lady cried to the postboy in a voice ofdespair</s>  sir charles is certainly lost and i shall have to spend thenight upon the moor</s> perhaps i can be of some assistance to madame said i scrambling outfrom among the bushes into the glare of the lamps</s>  a woman in distressis a sacred thing to me and this one was beautiful</s>

for another three hours during which i still guidedmyself you understand by keeping the wind in my face</s>  at the end ofthat time i calculated that i had put nearly twenty miles between theprison and myself</s>  day was about to break so i crouched down among theheather upon the top of one of those small hills which abound in thatcountry with the intention of hiding myself until nightfall</s>  it was nonew thing for me to sleep in the wind and the rain so wrapping myselfup in my thick warm cloak i soon sank into a doze</s> but it was not a refreshing slumber</s>  i tossed and tumbled amid a seriesof vile dreams in which everything seemed to go wrong with me</s>  at lasti remember i was charging an unshaken square of hungarian grenadierswith a single squadron upon spent horses just as i did at elchingen</s>  istood in my stirrups to shout vive lempereur</s>  and as i did so therecame the answering roar from my hussars vive lempereur</s>  i sprangfrom my rough bed with the words still ringing in my ears and then asi rubbed my eyes and wondered if i were mad the same cry came againfive thousand voices in one longdrawn yell</s>  i looked out from my screenof brambles and saw in the clear light of morning the very last thingthat i should either have expected or chosen</s> it was dartmoor prison</s>  there it stretched grim and hideous within afurlong of me</s>  had i run on for a few more minutes in the dark i shouldhave butted my shako against the wall</s>  i was so taken aback at thesight that i could scarcely realize what had happened</s>  then it allbecame clear to me and i struck my head with my hands in my despair</s> the wind had veered from north to south during the night and i keepingmy face always towards it had run ten miles out and ten miles inwinding up where i had started</s>  when i thought of my hurry my falls mymad rushing and jumping all ending in this it seemed so absurd thatmy grief changed suddenly to amusement and i fell among the bramblesand laughed and laughed until my sides were sore</s>  then i rolled myselfup in my cloak and considered seriously what i should do</s> one lesson which i have learned in my roaming life my friends isnever to call anything a misfortune until you have seen the end of it</s> is not every hour a fresh point of view</s>  in this case i soon perceivedthat accident had done for me as much as the most profound cunning</s>  myguards naturally commenced their search from the place where i had takensir charles merediths coat and from my hidingplace i could see themhurrying along the road to that point</s>  not one of them ever dreamed thati could have doubled back from there and i lay quite undisturbed in thelittle bushcovered cup at the summit of my knoll</s>  the prisoners had ofcourse learned of my escape and all day exultant yells like thatwhich had aroused me in the morning resounded over the moor bearing awelcome message of sympathy and companionship to my ears</s>  how little didthey dream that on the top of that very mound which they could see fromtheir windows was lying the comrade whose escape they were celebrating</s> as for mei could look down upon this poor herd of idle warriors asthey paced about the great exercise yard or gathered in little groupsgesticulating joyfully over my success</s>  once i heard a howl ofexecration and i saw beaumont his head all covered with bandagesbeing led across the yard by two of the warders</s>  i cannot tell you thepleasure which this sight gave me for it proved that i had not killedhim and also that the others knew the true story of what had passed</s> they had all known me too well to think that i could have abandoned him</s> all that long day i lay behind my screen of bushes listening to thebells which struck the hours below</s> my pockets were filled with bread which i had saved out of my allowanceand on searching my borrowed overcoat i came upon a silver flask fullof excellent brandy and water so that i was able to get through the daywithout hardship</s>  the only other things in the pockets were a red silkhandkerchief a tortoiseshell snuffbox and a blue envelope with ared seal addressed to the governor of dartmoor prison</s>  as to the firsttwo i determined to send them back when i should return the coatitself</s> the letter caused me more perplexity for the governor had always shownme every courtesy and it offended my sense of honour that i shouldinterfere with his correspondence</s>  i had almost made up my mind to leaveit under a stone upon the roadway within musketshot of the gate</s>  thiswould guide them in their search for me however and so on the wholei saw no better way than just to carry the letter with me in the hopethat i might find some means of sending it back to him</s>  meanwhile ipacked it safely away in my innermost pocket</s>
 i promise you that there were no mistakes this time</s>  itook the stars for my guides as every hussar should be taught to doand i put eight good leagues between myself and the prison</s>  my plan nowwas to obtain a complete suit of clothes from the first person whom icould waylay and i should then find my way to the north coast wherethere were many smugglers and fishermen who would be ready to earn thereward which was paid by the emperor to those who brought escapingprisoners across the channel</s>  i had taken the panache from my shako sothat it might escape notice but even with my fine overcoat i fearedthat sooner or later my uniform would betray me</s>  my first care must beto provide myself with a complete disguise</s> when day broke i saw a river upon my right and a small town upon myleftthe blue smoke reeking up above the moor</s>  i should have liked wellto have entered it because it would have interested me to see somethingof the customs of the english which differ very much from those ofother nations</s>  much as i should have wished however to have seen themeat their raw meat and sell their wives it would have been dangerousuntil i had got rid of my uniform</s>  my cap my moustache and my speechwould all help to betray me</s>  i continued to travel towards the norththerefore looking about me continually but never catching a glimpse ofmy pursuers</s> about midday i came to where in a secluded valley there stood a singlesmall cottage without any other building in sight</s>  it was a neat littlehouse with a rustic porch and a small garden in front of it with aswarm of cocks and hens</s>  i lay down among the ferns and watched it forit seemed to be exactly the kind of place where i might obtain what iwanted</s>  my bread was finished and i was exceedingly hungry after mylong journey i determined therefore to make a short reconnaissanceand then to march up to this cottage summon it to surrender and helpmyself to all that i needed</s>  it could at least provide me with a chickenand with an omelette</s>  my mouth watered at the thought</s> as i lay there wondering who could live in this lonely place a brisklittle fellow came out through the porch accompanied by another olderman who carried two large clubs in his hands</s>
 the other standing beside him appeared towatch him with great attention and occasionally to advise him</s>  finallyhe took a rope and began skipping like a girl the other still gravelyobserving him</s>  as you may think i was utterly puzzled as to what thesepeople could be and could only surmise that the one was a doctor andthe other a patient who had submitted himself to some singular method oftreatment</s> well as i lay watching and wondering the older man brought out agreatcoat and held it while the other put it on and buttoned it to hischin</s>  the day was a warmish one so that this proceeding amazed me evenmore than the other</s>  at least thought i it is evident that hisexercise is over but far from this being so the man began to run inspite of his heavy coat and as it chanced he came right over the moorin my direction</s>  his companion had reentered the house so that thisarrangement suited me admirably</s>  i would take the small mans clothingand hurry on to some village where i could buy provisions</s>  the chickenswere certainly tempting but still there were at least two men in thehouse so perhaps it would be wiser for me since i had no arms to keepaway from

to be a very solidmanbut smallso small that i feared that his clothes might be oflittle use to me</s>  when i jumped out upon him he stopped running andlooked at me in the greatest astonishment</s>

knew nothing of the methods offighting which these people have but on horse or on foot with arms orwithout them i am always ready to take my own part</s>  you understand thata soldier cannot always choose his own methods and that it is time tohowl when you are living among wolves</s>  i rushed at him therefore witha warlike shout and kicked him with both my feet</s>  at the same moment myheels

it for two days</s> since the night before last</s> and never looked at the contents</s> i showed him by my manner that he had committed an indiscretion inasking a question which one gentleman should

 they would hold the elbe until the great army ofconscripts which the emperor was raising in france should be ready tohelp them to cross it once more</s> but the cavalry was in a deplorable condition</s>  my own hussars were atborna and when i paraded them first i burst into tears at the sight ofthem</s>  my fine men and my beautiful horsesit broke my heart to see thestate to which they were reduced</s>  but courage i thought they havelost much but their colonel is still left to them</s>  i set to worktherefore to repair their disasters and had already constructed twogood squadrons

doubtless that i was overjoyed at this chance ofvisiting home once more</s>  i will not deny that it was a pleasure to me toknow that i should see my mother again and there were a few girls whowould

no arguingwhen the blue paper with the little red seal arrives so within an houri was off upon my great ride from the elbe to the vosges</s>  at last i wasto have a period of quiet</s>  war lay behind my mares tail and peace infront of her nostrils</s>  so i thought as the sound of the bugles died inthe distance and the long white road curled away in front of methrough plain and forest and mountain with france somewhere beyond theblue haze which lay upon the horizon</s> it is interesting but it is also fatiguing to ride in the rear of anarmy</s>  in the harvest time our soldiers could do without supplies forthey had been trained to pluck the grain in the fields as they passedand to grind it for themselves in their bivouacs</s>  it was at that time ofyear therefore that those swift marches were performed which were thewonder and the despair of europe</s>  but now the starving men had to bemade robust once more and i was forced to draw into the ditchcontinually as the coburg sheep and the bavarian bullocks came streamingpast with waggon loads of berlin beer and good french cognac</s>  sometimestoo i would hear the dry rattle of the drums and the shrill whistle ofthe fifes and long columns of our good little infantry men would swingpast me with the white dust lying thick upon their blue tunics</s>  thesewere old soldiers drawn from the garrisons of our german fortresses forit was not until may that the new conscripts began to arrive fromfrance</s> well i was rather tired of this eternal stopping and dodging so that iwas not sorry when i came to altenburg to find that the road dividedand that i could take the southern and quieter branch</s>  there were fewwayfarers between there and greiz and the road wound through groves ofoaks and beeches which shot their branches across the path</s>  you willthink it strange that a colonel of hussars should again and again pullup his horse in order to admire the beauty of the feathery branches andthe little green newbudded leaves but if you had spent six monthsamong the fir trees of russia you would be able to understand me</s> there was something however which pleased me very much less than thebeauty of the forests and that was the words and looks of the folk wholived in the woodland villages</s>  we had always been excellent friendswith the germans and during the last six years they had never seemed tobear us any malice for having made a little free with their country</s>  wehad shown kindnesses to the men and received them from the women sothat good comfortable germany was a second home to all of us</s>  but nowthere was something which i could not understand in the behaviour of thepeople</s>  the travellers made no answer to my salute the foresters turnedtheir heads away to avoid seeing me and in the villages the folk wouldgather into knots in the roadway and would scowl at me as i passed</s>  evenwomen would do this and it was something new for me in those days tosee anything but a smile in a

moustache and to wash the dust out of poor violettes throat</s> it was my way to give some little compliment or possibly a kiss to themaid who served me but this one would have neither the one nor theother but darted a glance at me like a bayonetthrust</s>  then when iraised my glass to the folk who drank their beer by the door they turnedtheir backs on me save only one fellow who cried heres a toast foryou boys</s>  heres to the letter t</s>  at that they all emptied their beermugs and laughed but it was not a laugh that had goodfellowship in it</s> i was turning this over in my head and wondering what their boorishconduct could mean when i saw as i rode from the village a great tnew carved upon a tree</s>  i had already seen more than one in my morningsride but i had given no thought to them until the words of thebeerdrinker gave them an importance</s>  it chanced that arespectablelooking person was riding past me at the moment so i turnedto him for information</s> can you tell me sir said i what this letter t is</s> he looked at it and then at me in the most singular fashion</s>  youngman said he it is not the letter n</s>  then before i could ask furtherhe clapped his spurs into his horses ribs and rode stomach to earthupon his way</s> at first his words had no particular significance in my mind but as itrotted onwards violette chanced to half turn her dainty head and

germany thenduring our absence and the giant sleeper had begun to stir</s>  i thoughtof the mutinous faces that i had seen and i felt that if i could onlyhave looked into the hearts of these people i might have had somestrange news to bring into france with me</s>  it made me the more eager toget my remounts and to see ten strong squadrons behind my kettledrumsonce more</s> while these thoughts were passing through my head i had been alternatelywalking and trotting as a man should who has a long journey before anda willing horse beneath him</s>  the woods were very open at this pointand beside the road there lay a great heap of fagots</s>  as i passed therecame a sharp sound from among them and glancing round i saw a facelooking out at mea hot red face like that of a man who is

broken voice histwitching face and his eyes glancing swiftly to right and left andopening in horror whenever a branch cracked upon a tree</s>  it was clearthat he was in the last extremity of terror and it is possible that hehad cause for shortly after i had left him i heard a distant gunshotand a shouting from somewhere behind me</s>  it may have been some sportsmanhalloaing to his dogs but i never again heard of or saw the man who hadgiven me my warning</s> i kept a good lookout after this riding swiftly where the country wasopen and slowly where there might be an ambuscade</s>  it was serious forme since 500 good miles of german soil lay in front of me but somehowi did not take it very much to heart for the germans had always seemedto me to be a kindly gentle people whose hands closed more readilyround a pipestem than a swordhiltnot out of want of valour youunderstand but because they are genial open souls who would rather beon good terms with all men</s>  i did not know then that beneath that homelysurface there lurks a devilry as fierce as and far more persistentthan that of the castilian or the italian</s> and it was not long before i had shown to me that there was somethingmore serious abroad than rough words and hard looks</s>  i had come to aspot where the road runs upwards through a wild tract of heathland andvanishes into an oak wood</s>  i may have been halfway up the hill whenlooking forward i saw something gleaming under the shadow of thetreetrunks and a man came out with a coat which was so slashed andspangled with gold that he blazed like a fire in the sunlight</s>  heappeared to be very drunk for he reeled and staggered as he cametowards me</s>  one of his hands was held up to his ear and clutched a greatred handkerchief which was fixed to his neck</s> i had reined up the mare and was looking at him with some disgust forit seemed strange to me that one who wore so gorgeous a uniform shouldshow himself in such a state in broad daylight</s>  for his part he lookedhard in my direction and came slowly onwards stopping from time to timeand swaying about as he gazed at me</s>  suddenly as i again advanced hescreamed out his thanks to christ and lurching forwards he fell witha crash upon the dusty road</s>  his hands flew forward with the fall and isaw that what i had taken for a red cloth was a monstrous wound whichhad left a great gap in his neck from which a dark bloodclot hunglike an epaulette upon his shoulder</s> my god</s>  i cried as i sprang to his aid</s>  and i thought that you weredrunk</s> not drunk but dying said he</s>  but thank heaven that i have seen afrench officer while i have still strength to speak</s> i laid him among the heather and poured some brandy down his throat</s>  allround us was the vast countryside green and peaceful with nothingliving in sight save only the mutilated man beside me</s> who has done this</s>  i asked and what are you</s>  you are french and yetthe uniform is strange to me</s> it is that of the emperors new guard of honour</s>  i am the marquis ofchteau st arnaud and i am the ninth of my blood who has died in theservice of france</s>  i have been pursued and wounded by the nightridersof lutzow but i hid among the brushwood yonder and waited in the hopethat a frenchman might pass</s>  i could not be sure at first if you werefriend or foe but i felt that death was very near and that i must takethe chance</s> keep your heart up comrade said i i have seen a man with a worsewound who has lived to boast of it</s> no no he whispered i am going

castle of hof</s>  he is still true to us but theprincess is our deadly enemy</s>  she is striving to make him declareagainst us</s>  if he does so it will determine all those who are waveringfor the

perhaps youwill have saved all germany for the emperor</s>  had my horse not been shoti might wounded as i am he choked and the cold hand tightenedinto a grip which left mine as bloodless as itself</s>  then with a groanhis head jerked back and it was all over with him</s> here was a fine start for my journey home</s>  i was left with a commissionof which i knew little which would lead me to delay the pressing needsof my hussars and which at the same time was of such importance that itwas impossible for me to avoid it</s>  i opened the marquiss tunic thebrilliance of which had been devised by the emperor in order to attractthose young aristocrats from whom he hoped to raise these new regimentsof his guard</s>  it was a small packet of papers which i drew out tied upwith silk and addressed to the prince of saxefelstein</s>  in the cornerin a sprawling untidy hand which i knew to be the emperors own waswritten pressing and most important</s>  it was an order to me thosefour wordsan order as clear as if it had come straight from the firmlips with the cold grey eyes looking into mine</s>  my troopers might waitfor their horses the dead marquis might lie where i had laid himamongst the heather but if the mare and her rider had a breath left inthem the papers should reach the prince that night</s> i should not have feared to ride by the road through the wood for ihave learned in spain that the safest time to pass through a guerillacountry is after an outrage and that the moment of danger is when allis peaceful</s>  when i came to look upon my map however i saw that hoflay further to the south of me and that i might reach it more directlyby keeping to the moors</s>  off i set therefore and had not gone fiftyyards before two carbine shots rang out of the brushwood and a bullethummed past me like a bee</s>  it was clear that the nightriders werebolder in their ways than the brigands of spain and that my missionwould have ended where it had begun if i had kept to the road</s> it was a mad ride thata ride with a loose rein girthdeep in heatherand in gorse plunging through bushes flying down hillsides with myneck at the mercy of my dear little violette</s>  but sheshe neverslipped she never faltered as swift and as surefooted as if she knewthat her rider carried the fate of all germany beneath the buttons ofhis pelisse</s>  and ii had long borne the name of being the besthorseman in the six brigades of light cavalry but i never rode as irode then</s>  my friend the bart had told me of how they hunt the fox inengland but the swiftest fox would have been

though the emperor would not have thankedme for it for he had many men but only onewell cavalry leaders ofthe first class are rare</s> but here i had an object which was indeed worth a sacrifice and ithought no more of my life than of the clods of earth that flew from mydarlings heels</s> we struck the road once more as the light was failing and galloped intothe little village of lobenstein</s>  but we had hardly got upon thecobblestones when off came one of the mares shoes and i had to leadher to the village smithy</s>  his fire was low and his days work done sothat it would be an hour at the least before i could hope to push on tohof</s>  cursing at the delay i strode into the village inn and ordered acold chicken and some wine to be served for my dinner</s>  it was but a fewmiles to hof and i had every hope that i might deliver my papers to theprince on that very night and be on my way for france next morning withdespatches for the emperor in my bosom</s>  i will tell you now what befellme in the inn of lobenstein</s> the chicken had been served and the wine drawn and i had turned uponboth as a man may who has ridden such a ride when i was aware of amurmur and a scuffling in the hall outside my door</s>  at first i thoughtthat it was some brawl between peasants in their cups and i left themto settle their own affairs</s>  but of a sudden there broke from among thelow sullen growl of the voices such a sound as would send etiennegerard leaping from his deathbed</s>  it was the whimpering cry of a womanin pain</s>  down clattered my knife and my fork and in an instant i wasin the thick of the crowd which had gathered outside my door</s> the heavycheeked landlord was there and his flaxenhaired wife the twomen from the stables a chambermaid and two or three villagers</s>  all ofthem women and men were flushed and angry while there in the centreof them with pale cheeks and terror in her eyes stood the loveliestwoman that ever a soldier would wish to look upon</s>  with her queenly headthrown back and a touch of defiance mingled with her fear she lookedas she gazed round her like a creature of a different race from thevile coarsefeatured crew who surrounded her</s>  i had not taken two stepsfrom my door before she sprang to meet me her hand resting upon my armand her blue eyes sparkling with joy and triumph</s> a french soldier and gentleman</s>  she cried</s>
yes madam you are safe said i and i could not resist taking herhand in mine in order that i might reassure her</s>  you have only tocommand me i added kissing the hand as a sign that i meant what i wassaying</s>
 they abuseme because i love the french</s>  i do not know what they might have done tome had heaven not sent you to my help</s> i kissed her hand again lest she should doubt my intentions</s>  then iturned upon the crew with such an expression as i know how to assume</s>  inan instant the hall was empty</s> countess said i you are now under my protection</s>  you are faint anda glass of wine is necessary to restore you</s>  i offered her my arm andescorted her into my room where she sat by my side at the table andtook the refreshment which i offered her</s>
 she lit up the room with her beauty</s>  she must have read myadmiration in my eyes and it seemed to me that i also could seesomething of the sort in her own</s>  ah</s>  my friends i was

mothers have to fear</s>  for myself i feltthat i was the guardian of this lonely lady and knowing what adangerous man i had to deal with i kept strict watch upon myself</s> still even a guardian has

tocharpentier he had the kind of horse which a horse grenadier or acuirassier would be likely to ride a back like a bedstead youunderstand and legs like the posts</s>  he is a hulking fellow himself sothat they looked a singular pair</s>  and yet in his insane conceit he ogledthe girls as they waved their handkerchiefs to me from the windows andhe twirled his ugly red moustache up into his eyes

conscripts</s>  the artillery and theheavy cavalry were also good if there were more of them but theinfantry privates with their under officers looked like schoolboys withtheir masters</s>  and we had no reserves</s>  when one considered that therewere 80000 prussians to the north and 150000 russians and austrians tothe south it might make even the bravest man grave</s> for my own part i confess that i shed a tear until the thought camethat the emperor was still with us and that on that very morning he hadplaced his hand upon my dolman and had promised me a medal of honour</s> this set me singing and i spurred violette on until charpentier had tobeg me to have mercy on his great snorting panting camel</s>  the road wasbeaten into paste and rutted two feet deep by the artillery so that hewas right in saying that it was not the place for a gallop</s> i have never been very friendly with this charpentier and now fortwenty miles of the way i could not draw a word from him</s>  he rode withhis brows puckered and his chin upon his breast like a man who is heavywith thought</s>  more than once i asked him what was on his mind thinkingthat perhaps with my quicker intelligence i might set the matterstraight</s>  his answer always was that it was his mission of which he wasthinking which surprised me because although i had never thought muchof his intelligence still it seemed to me to be impossible that anyonecould be puzzled by so simple and soldierly a task</s> well we came at last to bazoches where he was to take the southernroad and i the northern</s>  he half turned in his saddle before he left meand he looked at me with a singular expression of inquiry in his face</s> what do you make of it brigadier</s>  he asked</s> of what</s> of our mission</s> surely it is plain enough</s> you think so</s>  why should the emperor tell us his plans</s> because he recognized our intelligence</s> my companion laughed in a manner which i found annoying</s> may i ask what you intend to do if you find these villages full ofprussians</s>  he asked</s> i shall obey my orders</s> but you will be killed</s> very possibly</s> he laughed again and so offensively that i clapped my hand to my sword</s> but before i could tell him what i thought of his stupidity and rudenesshe had wheeled his horse and was lumbering away down the other road</s>  isaw his big fur cap vanish over the brow of the hill and then i rodeupon my way wondering at his conduct</s>  from time to time i put my handto the breast of my tunic and felt the paper crackle beneath my fingers</s> ah my precious paper which should be turned into the little silvermedal for which i had yearned so long</s>  all the way from braine tosermoise i was thinking of what my mother would say when she saw it</s> i stopped to give violette a meal at a wayside auberge on the side of ahill not far from soissonsa place surrounded by old oaks and with somany crows that one could scarce hear ones own voice</s>  it was from theinnkeeper that i learned that marmont had fallen back two days beforeand that the prussians were over the aisne</s>  an hour later in the fadinglight i saw two of their vedettes upon the hill to the right and thenas darkness gathered the heavens to the north were all glimmering fromthe lights of a bivouac</s> when i heard that blucher had been there for two days i was muchsurprised that the emperor should not have known that the countrythrough which he had ordered me to carry my precious letter was alreadyoccupied by the enemy</s>  still i thought of the tone of his voice when hesaid to charpentier that a soldier must not choose but must obey</s>  ishould follow the route he had laid down for me as long as violettecould move a hoof or i a finger upon her bridle</s>  all the way fromsermoise to soissons where the road dips up and down curving among firwoods i kept my pistol ready and my swordbelt braced pushing onswiftly where the path was straight and then coming slowly round thecorners in the way we learned in spain</s> when i came to the farmhouse which lies to the right of the road justafter you cross the wooden bridge over the crise near where the greatstatue of the virgin stands a woman cried to me from the field sayingthat the prussians were in soissons</s>  a small party of their lancers shesaid had come in that very afternoon and a whole division was expectedbefore midnight</s>  i did not wait to hear the end of her tale but clappedspurs into violette and in five minutes was galloping her into thetown</s> three uhlans were at the mouth of the main street their horsestethered and they gossiping together each with a pipe as long as mysabre</s>  i saw them well in the light of an open door but of me theycould have seen only the flash of violettes grey side and the blackflutter of my cloak</s>  a moment later i flew through a stream of themrushing from an open gateway</s>  violettes shoulder sent one of themreeling and i stabbed at another but missed him</s>  pang pang went twocarbines but i had flown round the curve of the street and never somuch as heard the hiss of the balls</s>  ah we were great both violetteand i</s>  she lay down to it like a coursed hare the fire flying from herhoofs</s>  i stood in my stirrups and brandished my sword</s>  someone sprangfor my bridle</s>  i sliced him through the arm and i heard him howlingbehind me</s>  two horsemen closed upon me</s>  i cut one down and outpaced theother</s>  a minute later i was clear of the town and flying down a broadwhite road with the black poplars on either side</s>  for a time i heard therattle of hoofs behind me but they died and died until i could not tellthem from the throbbing of my own heart</s>  soon i pulled up and listenedbut all was silent</s>  they had given up the chase</s> well the first thing that i did was to dismount and to lead my mareinto a small wood through which a stream ran</s>  there i watered her andrubbed her down giving her two pieces of sugar soaked in cognac from myflask</s>  she was spent from the sharp chase but it was wonderful to seehow she came round with a halfhours rest</s>  when my thighs closed uponher again i could tell by the spring and the swing of her that it wouldnot be her fault if i did not win my way safe to paris</s> i must have been well within the enemys lines now for i heard a numberof them shouting one of their rough drinking songs out of a house by theroadside and i went round by the fields to avoid it</s>  at another timetwo men came out into the moonlight for by this time it was a cloudlessnight and shouted something in german but i galloped on withoutheeding them and they were afraid to fire for their own hussars aredressed exactly as i was</s>  it is best to take no notice at these timesand then they put you down as a deaf man</s> it was a lovely moon and every tree threw a black bar across the road</s> i could see the countryside just as if it were daytime and verypeaceful it looked save that there was a great fire raging somewhere inthe north</s>  in the silence of the nighttime and with the knowledge thatdanger was in front and behind me the sight of that great distant firewas very striking and awesome</s>  but i am not easily clouded for i haveseen too many singular things so i hummed a tune between my teeth andthought of little lisette whom i might see in paris</s>
i am an excellent soldier</s>  i do not say this because i am prejudiced inmy own favour but because i really am so</s>  i can weigh every chance in amoment and decide with as much certainty as though i had brooded for aweek</s>  now i saw like a flash that come what might i should be chasedand on a horse which had already done a long twelve leagues</s>  but it wasbetter to be chased onwards than to be chased back</s>  on this moonlitnight with fresh horses behind me i must take my risk in either casebut if i were to shake them off i preferred that it should be nearsenlis than near soissons</s> all this flashed on me as if by instinct you understand</s>  my eyes hadhardly rested on the bearded faces under the brass helmets before myrowels had touched violette and she was off with a rattle like apasdecharge</s>  oh the shouting and rushing and stamping from behind us</s> three of them fired and three swung themselves on to their horses</s>  abullet rapped on the crupper of my saddle with a noise like a stick on adoor</s>  violette sprang madly forward and i thought she had been woundedbut it was only a graze above the near forefetlock</s>  ah the dear littlemare how i loved her when i felt her settle down into that long easygallop of hers her hoofs going like a spanish girls castanets</s>  i couldnot hold myself</s>  i turned on my saddle and shouted and raved vivelempereur</s>  i screamed and laughed at the gust of oaths that came backto me</s> but it was not over yet</s>  if she had been fresh she might have gained amile in five</s>  now she could only hold her own with a very little over</s> there was one of them a young boy of an officer who was better mountedthan the others</s>  he drew ahead with every stride</s>  two hundred yardsbehind him were two troopers but i saw every time that i glanced roundthat the distance between them was increasing</s>  the other three who hadwaited to shoot were a long way in the rear</s> the officers mount was a baya fine horse though not to be spoken ofwith violette yet it was a powerful brute and it seemed to me that ina few miles its freshness might tell</s>  i waited until the lad was a longway in front of his comrades and then i eased my mare down a littleavery very little so that he might think he was really catching me</s> when he came within pistolshot of me i drew and cocked my own pistoland laid my chin upon my shoulder to see what he would do</s>  he did notoffer to fire and i soon discerned the cause</s>  the silly boy had takenhis pistols from his holsters when he had camped for the night</s>  hewagged his sword at me now and roared some threat or other</s>  he did notseem to understand that he was at my mercy</s>  i eased violette down untilthere was not the length of a long lance between the grey tail and thebay muzzle</s> rendezvous</s>  he yelled</s> i must compliment monsieur upon his french said i resting the barrelof my pistol upon my bridlearm which i have always found best whenshooting from the saddle</s>  i aimed at his face and could see even inthe moonlight how white he grew when he understood that it was all upwith him</s>  but even as my finger pressed the trigger i thought of hismother and i put my ball through his horses shoulder</s>  i fear he hurthimself in the fall for it was a fearful crash but i had my letter tothink of so i stretched the mare into a gallop once more</s> but they were not so easily shaken off these brigands</s>  the two troopersthought no more of their young officer than if he had been a recruitthrown in the ridingschool</s>  they left him to the others and thunderedon after me</s>  i had pulled up on the brow of a hill thinking that i hadheard the last of them but my faith i soon saw there was no time forloitering so away we went the mare tossing her head and i my shako toshow what we thought of two dragoons who tried to catch a hussar</s>  but atthis moment even while i laughed at the thought my heart stood stillwithin me for there at the end of the long white road was a black patchof cavalry waiting to receive me</s>  to a young soldier it might haveseemed the shadow of the trees but to me it was a troop of hussarsand turn where i could death seemed to be waiting for me</s> well i had the dragoons behind me and the hussars in front</s>  never sincemoscow have i seemed to be in such peril</s>  but for the honour of thebrigade i had rather be cut down by a light cavalryman than by a heavy</s> i never drew bridle therefore or hesitated for an instant but i letviolette have her head</s>  i remember that i tried to pray as i rode but iam a little out of practice at such things and the only words i couldremember were the prayer for fine weather which we used at the school onthe evening before holidays</s>  even this seemed better than nothing and iwas pattering it out when suddenly i heard french voices in front ofme</s>  ah mon dieu but the joy went through my heart like a musketball</s> they were oursour own dear little rascals from the corps of marmont</s> round whisked my two dragoons and galloped for their lives with themoon gleaming on their brass helmets while i trotted up to my friendswith no undue haste for i would have them understand that though ahussar may fly it is not in his nature to fly very fast</s>  yet i fearthat violettes heaving flanks and foamspattered muzzle gave the lieto my careless bearing</s> who should be at the head of the troop but old bouvet whom i saved atleipzig</s>  when he saw me his little pink eyes filled with tears

cannot go</s> i prefer to go where the enemy is i answered</s> but why not go straight to paris with your despatch</s>  why should youchoose to pass through the one place where you are almost sure to betaken or killed</s> a soldier does not choosehe obeys said i just as i had heardnapoleon say it</s> old bouvet laughed in his wheezy way until i had to give my moustachiosa twirl and look him up and down in a manner which brought him toreason</s> well said he you had best come along with us for we are all boundfor senlis</s>  our orders are to reconnoitre the place</s>  a squadron ofponiatowskis

with the polesfine old soldiers all of them though a trifleheavy for their horses</s>  it was a treat to see them for they could nothave carried themselves better if they had belonged to my own brigade</s> we rode together until in the early morning we saw the lights ofsenlis</s>  a peasant was coming along with a cart and from him we learnedhow things were going there</s> his information was certain for his brother was the mayors coachmanand he had spoken with him late the night before</s>  there was a singlesquadron of cossacksor a polk as they call it in their

woods to the northbut only the cossacks were in senlis</s>  ah what a chance to avengeourselves upon these barbarians whose cruelty to our poor countryfolkwas the talk at every camp fire</s> we were into the town like a torrent hacked down the vedettes rodeover the guard and were smashing in the doors of the mayors housebefore they understood that there was a frenchman within twenty miles ofthem</s>  we saw horrid heads at the windowsheads bearded to the templeswith tangled hair and sheepskin caps and silly gaping mouths</s>  hourra</s> hourra</s>  they shrieked and fired with their carbines but our fellowswere into the house and at their throats before they had wiped the sleepout of their eyes</s>  it was dreadful to see how the poles flung themselvesupon them like starving

 their equipment is of course much lighter since they arewithout the cuirass backplate and helmet</s> well it was at this point that i made an errora very serious error itmust be admitted</s>  up to this moment i had carried out my mission in amanner which only my modesty prevents me from describing as remarkable</s> but now i did that which an official would condemn and a soldier excuse</s> there is no doubt that the mare was spent but still it is true that imight have galloped on through senlis and reached the country where ishould have had no enemy between me and paris</s>  but what hussar can ridepast a fight and never draw rein</s>  it is to ask too much of him</s> besides i thought that if violette had an hour of rest i might havethree hours the better at the other end</s>  then on the top of it camethose heads at the windows with their sheepskin hats and theirbarbarous cries</s>  i sprang from my saddle threw violettes bridle over arailpost and ran into the house with the rest</s>  it is true that i wastoo late to be of service and that i was nearly wounded by alancethrust from one of these dying savages</s>  still it is a pity tomiss even the smallest affair for one never knows what opportunity foradvancement may present itself</s>  i have seen more soldierly work inoutpost skirmishes and little gallopandhack affairs of the kind thanin any of the emperors big battles</s> when the house was cleared i took a bucket of water out for violetteand our peasant guide showed me where the good mayor kept his fodder</s>  myfaith but the little sweetheart was ready for it</s>  then i sponged downher legs and leaving her still tethered i went back into the house tofind a mouthful for myself so that i should not need to halt againuntil i was in paris</s> and now i come to the part of my story which may seem singular to youalthough i could tell you at least ten things every bit as queer whichhave happened to me in my lifetime</s>  you can understand that to a manwho spends his life in scouting and vedette duties on the bloody groundwhich lies between two great armies there are many chances of strangeexperiences</s>  ill tell you however exactly what occurred</s> old bouvet was waiting in the passage when i entered and he asked mewhether we might not crack a bottle of wine together</s>  my faith we mustnot be long said he</s>  there are ten thousand of theilmanns prussiansin the woods up yonder</s> where is the wine</s>  i asked</s> ah you may trust two hussars to find where the wine is said he andtaking a candle in his hand he led the way down the stone stairs intothe kitchen</s> when we got there we found another door which opened on to a windingstair with the cellar at the bottom</s>  the cossacks had been there beforeus as was easily seen by the broken bottles littered all over it</s> however the mayor was a bonvivant and i do not wish to have abetter set of bins to pick from</s>  chambertin graves alicant white wineand red sparkling and still they lay in pyramids peeping coyly out ofsawdust</s>  old bouvet stood with his candle looking here and peepingthere purring in his throat like a cat before a milkpail</s>  he hadpicked upon a burgundy at last and had his hand outstretched to thebottle when there came a roar of musketry from above us a rush of feetand such a yelping and screaming as i have never listened to</s>  theprussians were upon us</s> bouvet is a brave man i will say that for him</s>  he flashed out his swordand away he clattered up the stone steps his spurs clinking as he ran</s> i followed him but just as we came out into the kitchen passage atremendous shout told us that the house had been recaptured</s> it is all over i cried grasping at bouvets sleeve</s> there is one more to die he shouted and away he went like a madmanup the second stair</s>  in effect i should have gone to my death also hadi been in his place for he had done very wrong in not throwing out hisscouts to warn him if the germans advanced upon him</s>  for an instant iwas about to rush up with him and then i bethought myself that afterall i had my own mission to think of and that if i were taken theimportant letter of the emperor would be sacrificed</s>  i let bouvet diealone therefore and i went down into the cellar again closing thedoor behind me</s> well it was not a very rosy prospect down there either</s>  bouvet haddropped the candle when the alarm came and i pawing about in thedarkness could find nothing but broken bottles</s>  at last i came uponthe candle which had rolled under the curve of a cask but try as iwould with my tinderbox i could not light it</s>  the reason was that thewick had been wet in a puddle of wine so suspecting that this might bethe case i cut the end off with my sword</s>  then i found that it lightedeasily enough</s>  but what to do i could not imagine</s>  the scoundrelsupstairs were shouting themselves hoarse several hundred of them fromthe sound and it was clear that some of them would soon want to moistentheir throats</s>
 i thought of my mother and i thought of theemperor</s>  it made me weep to think that the one would lose so excellent ason and the other the best light cavalry officer he ever had sincelasalles time</s>  but presently i dashed the tears from my eyes</s> courage</s>  i cried striking myself upon the chest</s>  courage my braveboy</s>  is it possible that one who has come safely from moscow without somuch as a frostbite will die in a french winecellar</s>  at the thought iwas up on my feet and clutching at the letter in my tunic for thecrackle of it gave me courage</s> my first plan was to set fire to the house in the hope of escaping inthe confusion</s>  my second to get into an empty winecask</s>  i was lookinground to see if i could find one when suddenly in the corner i espieda little low door painted of the same grey colour as the wall so thatit was only a man with quick sight who would have noticed it</s>  i pushedagainst it and at first i imagined that it was locked</s>  presentlyhowever it gave a little and then i understood that it was held by thepressure of something on the other side</s>  i put my feet against ahogshead of wine and i gave such a push that the door flew open and icame down with a crash upon my back the candle flying out of my handsso that i found myself in darkness once more</s>  i picked myself up andstared through the black archway into the gloom beyond</s> there was a slight ray of light coming from some slit or grating</s>  thedawn had broken outside and i could dimly see the long curving sidesof several huge casks which made me think that perhaps this was wherethe mayor kept his reserves of wine while they were maturing</s>  at anyrate it seemed to be a safer hidingplace than the outer cellar sogathering up my candle i was just closing the door behind me when isuddenly saw something which filled me with amazement and even iconfess with the smallest little touch of fear</s> i have said that at the further end of the cellar there was a dim greyfan of light striking downwards from somewhere near the roof</s>  well as ipeered through the darkness i suddenly saw a great tall man skip intothis belt of daylight and then out again into the darkness at thefurther end</s>  my word i gave such a start that my shako nearly broke itschinstrap</s>  it was only a glance but none the less i had time to seethat the fellow had a hairy cossack cap on his head and that he was agreat longlegged broadshouldered brigand with a sabre at his waist</s> my faith even etienne gerard was a little staggered at being left alonewith such a creature in the dark</s> but only for a moment</s>  courage</s>  i thought</s>  am i not a hussar abrigadier too at the age of thirtyone and the chosen messenger ofthe emperor</s>  after all this skulker had more cause to be afraid of methan i of him</s>  and then suddenly i understood that he wasafraidhorribly afraid</s>  i could read it from his quick step and hisbent shoulders as he ran among the barrels like a rat making for itshole</s>  and of course it must have been he who had held the door againstme and not some packingcase or winecask as i had imagined</s>  he was thepursued then and i the pursuer</s>  aha i felt my whiskers bristle as iadvanced upon him through the darkness</s>  he would find that he had nochicken to deal with this robber from the north</s>  for the moment i wasmagnificent</s> at first i had feared to light my candle lest i should make a mark ofmyself but now after cracking my shin over a box and catching myspurs in some canvas i thought the bolder course the wiser</s>  i lit ittherefore and then i advanced with long strides my sword in my hand</s> come out you rascal</s>  i cried</s>  nothing can save you</s>  you will at lastmeet with your deserts</s>
 he had a gold chevron on his blackcap and the expression of his face told me in an instant that he was anofficer and a man of refinement</s> monsieur he cried in excellent french i surrender myself

with that he handed his sword over the top of thebarrel and i bowed with the candle on my heart</s>  whom have i the honourof capturing</s>  i asked</s> i am the count boutkine of the emperors own don

inquire howyou came into the back cellar</s> nothing more simple said he</s>  it was our intention to start at earlydawn</s>  feeling chilled after dressing i thought that a cup of wine woulddo me no harm so i came down to see what i could find</s>  as i wasrummaging about the house was suddenly carried by assault so rapidlythat by the time i had climbed the stairs it was all over</s>  it onlyremained for me to save myself so i came down here and hid myself inthe back cellar where you have found me</s> i thought of how old bouvet had behaved under the same conditions andthe tears sprang to my eyes as i contemplated the glory of france</s>  theni had to consider what i should do next</s>  it was clear that this russiancount being in the back cellar while we were in the front one had notheard the sounds which would have told him that the house was once againin the hands of his own allies</s>  if he should once understand this thetables would be turned and i should be his prisoner instead of he beingmine</s>  what was i to do</s>  i was at my wits end when suddenly there cameto me an idea so brilliant that i could not but be amazed at my owninvention</s> count boutkine said i i find myself in a most difficult position</s> and why</s>  he asked</s> because i have promised you your life</s> his jaw dropped a little</s> you would not withdraw your promise</s>  he cried</s> if the worst comes to the worst i can die in your defence said ibut the difficulties are great</s> what is it then</s>  he asked</s> i will be frank with you said i</s>  you must know that our fellows andespecially the poles are so incensed against the cossacks that the meresight of the uniform drives them mad</s>  they precipitate themselvesinstantly upon the wearer and tear him limb

to go up together at this moment icannot promise how far i could protect you</s> i am in your hands he cried</s>  what would you suggest that we shoulddo</s>  would it not be best that i should remain

mine</s>  that will make you sacred to every french soldier</s> it is not the french i fear so much as the poles</s> but my uniform will be a safeguard against either</s> how can i thank you</s>  he cried</s>  but youwhat are you to wear</s> i will wear yours</s> and perhaps fall a victim to your generosity</s> it is my duty to take the risk i answered but i have no fears</s>  iwill ascend in your uniform</s>  a hundred swords will be turned upon me</s> hold</s>  i will shout i am the brigadier gerard</s>  then they will see myface</s>  they will know me</s>  and i will tell them about you</s>  under theshield of these clothes you will be sacred</s> his fingers trembled with eagerness as he tore off his tunic</s>  his bootsand breeches were much like my own so there was no need to change thembut i gave him my hussar jacket my dolman my shako my swordbelt andmy sabretasche while i took in exchange his high sheepskin cap withthe gold chevron his furtrimmed coat and his crooked sword</s>  be itwell understood that in changing the tunics i did not forget to changemy thriceprecious letter also from my old one to my new</s> with your leave said i i shall now bind you to a barrel</s> he made a great fuss over this but i have learned in my soldieringnever to throw away chances and how could i tell that he might notwhen my back was turned see how the matter really stood and break inupon my plans</s>  he was leaning against a barrel at the time so i ran sixtimes round it with a rope and then tied it with a big knot behind</s>  ifhe wished to come upstairs he would at least have to carry a thousandlitres of good french wine for a knapsack</s>  i then shut the door of theback cellar behind me so that he might not hear what was going forwardand tossing the candle away i ascended the kitchen stair</s> there were only about twenty steps and yet while i came up them iseemed to have time to think of everything that i had ever hoped to do</s> it was the same feeling that i had at eylau when i lay with my brokenleg and saw the horse artillery galloping down upon me</s>
 of course iknew that if i were taken i should be shot instantly as being disguisedwithin the enemys lines</s>  still it was a glorious deathin the directservice of the emperorand i reflected that there could not be lessthan five lines and perhaps seven in the moniteur about me</s>  palarethad eight lines and i am sure that he had not so fine a career</s>
when i made my way out into the hall with all the nonchalance in myface and manner that i could assume the very first thing that i saw wasbouvets dead body with his legs drawn up and a broken sword in hishand</s>  i could see by the black smudge that he had been shot at closequarters</s>  i should have wished to salute as i went by for he was agallant man but i feared lest i should be seen and so i passed on</s> the front of the hall was full of prussian infantry who were knockingloopholes in the wall as though they expected that there might be yetanother attack</s>  their officer a little man was running about givingdirections</s>  they were all too busy to take much notice of me butanother officer who was standing by the door with a long pipe in hismouth strode across and clapped me on the shoulder pointing to thedead bodies of our poor hussars and saying something which was meantfor a jest for his long beard opened and showed every fang in his head</s> i laughed heartily also and said the only russian words that i knew</s>  ilearned them from little sophie at wilna and they meant if the nightis fine we shall meet under the oak tree but if it rains we shall meetin the byre</s>  it was all the same to this german however and i have nodoubt that he gave me credit for saying something very witty indeed forhe roared laughing and slapped me on my shoulder again</s>  i nodded to himand marched out of the halldoor as coolly as if i were the commandantof the garrison</s> there were a hundred horses tethered about outside most of thembelonging to the poles and hussars</s>  good little violette was waitingwith the others and she whinnied when she saw me coming towards her</s> but i would not mount her</s>  no</s>  i was much too cunning for that</s>  on thecontrary i chose the most shaggy little cossack horse that i could seeand i sprang upon it with as much assurance as though it had belonged tomy father before me</s>  it had a great bag of plunder slung over its neckand this i laid upon violettes back and led her along beside me</s>  neverhave you seen such a picture of the cossack returning from the foray</s>  itwas superb</s> well the town was full of prussians by this time</s>  they lined thesidewalks and pointed me out to each other saying as i could judgefrom their gestures there goes one of those devils of cossacks</s>  theyare the boys for foraging and plunder</s> one or two officers spoke to me with an air of authority but i shook myhead and smiled and said if the night is fine we shall meet under theoak tree but if it rains we shall meet in the byre at which theyshrugged their shoulders and gave the matter up</s>  in this way i workedalong until i was beyond the northern outskirt of the town</s>  i could seein the roadway two lancer vedettes with their black and white pennonsand i knew that when i was once past these i should be a free man oncemore</s>  i made my pony trot therefore violette rubbing her nose againstmy knee all the time and looking up at me to ask how she had deservedthat this hairy doormat of a creature should be preferred to her</s>  i wasnot more than a hundred yards from the uhlans when suddenly you canimagine my feelings when i saw a real cossack coming galloping along theroad towards me</s> ah my friend you who read this if you have any heart you will feelfor a man like me who had gone through so many dangers and trials onlyat this very last moment to be confronted with one which appeared to putan end to everything</s>  i will confess that for a moment i lost heart andwas inclined to throw myself down in my despair and to cry out that ihad been betrayed</s>  but no i was not beaten even now</s>  i opened twobuttons of my tunic so that i might get easily at the emperors messagefor it was my fixed determination when all hope was gone to swallow theletter and then die sword in hand</s>  then i felt that my little crookedsword was loose in its sheath and i trotted on to where the vedetteswere waiting</s>  they seemed inclined to stop me but i pointed to theother cossack who was still a couple of hundred yards off and theyunderstanding that i merely wished to meet him let me pass with asalute</s> i dug my spurs into my pony then for if i were only far enough from thelancers i thought i might manage the cossack without much difficulty</s>  hewas an officer a large bearded man with a gold chevron in his capjust the same as mine</s>  as i advanced he unconsciously aided me bypulling up his horse so that i had a fine start of the vedettes</s>  on icame for him and i could see wonder changing to suspicion in his browneyes as he looked at me and at my pony and at my equipment</s>  i do notknow what it was that was wrong but he saw something which was as itshould not be</s>  he shouted out a question and then when i gave no answerhe pulled out his sword</s>  i was glad in my heart to see him do so for ihad always rather fight than cut down an unsuspecting enemy</s>  now i madeat him full tilt and parrying his cut i got my point in just underthe fourth button of his tunic</s>  down he went and the weight of himnearly took me off my horse before i could disengage</s>  i never glanced athim to see if he were living or dead for i sprang off my pony and on toviolette with a shake of my bridle and a kiss of my hand to the twouhlans behind me</s>  they galloped after me shouting but violette had hadher rest and was just as fresh as when she started</s>  i took the firstside road to the west and then the first to the south which would takeme away from the enemys country</s>  on we went and on every stride takingme further from my foes and nearer to my friends</s>  at last when ireached the end of a long stretch of road and looking back from itcould see no sign of any pursuers i understood that my troubles wereover</s> and it gave me a glow of happiness as i rode to think that i had doneto the letter what the emperor had ordered</s>  what would he say when hesaw me</s>  what could he say which would do justice to the incredible wayin which i had risen above every danger</s>  he had ordered me to go throughsermoise soissons and senlis little dreaming that they were all threeoccupied by the enemy</s>  and yet i had done it</s>  i had borne his letter insafety through each of these towns</s>  hussars dragoons lancerscossacks and infantryi had run the gauntlet of all of them and hadcome out unharmed</s> when i had got as far as dammartin i caught a first glimpse of our ownoutposts</s>  there was a troop of dragoons in a field and of course icould see from the horsehair crests that they were french</s>  i gallopedtowards them in order to ask them if all was safe between there andparis and as i rode i felt such a pride at having won my way back to myfriends again that i could not refrain from waving my sword in the air</s> at this a young officer galloped out from among the dragoons alsobrandishing his sword and it warmed my heart to think that he shouldcome riding with such ardour and enthusiasm to greet me</s>  i madeviolette caracole and as we came together i brandished my sword moregallantly than ever but you can imagine my feelings when he suddenlymade a cut at me which would certainly have taken my head off if i hadnot fallen forward with my nose in violettes mane</s>  my faith itwhistled just over my cap like an east wind</s>  of course it came fromthis accursed cossack uniform which in my excitement i had forgottenall about and this young dragoon had imagined that i was some russianchampion who was challenging the french cavalry</s>  my word he was afrightened man when he understood how near he had been to killing thecelebrated brigadier gerard</s> well the road was clear and about three oclock in the afternoon i wasat st denis though it took me a long two hours to get from there toparis for the road was blocked with commissariat waggons and guns ofthe artillery reserve which was going north to marmont and mortier</s>
 word had gotabout from the dragoons two of whom had come with me and everybodyknew about my adventures and how i had come by my uniform</s>  it was atriumphmen shouting and women waving their handkerchiefs and blowingkisses from the windows</s> although i am a man singularly free from conceit still i must confessthat on this one occasion i could not restrain myself from showingthat this reception gratified me</s>  the russians coat had hung very looseupon me but now i threw out my chest until it was as tight as asausageskin</s>  and my little sweetheart of a mare tossed her mane andpawed with her front hoofs frisking her tail about as though she saidweve done it together this time</s>  it is to us that commissions shouldbe intrusted</s>  when i kissed her between the nostrils as i dismounted atthe gate of the tuileries there was as much shouting as if a bulletinhad been read from the grand army</s> i was hardly in costume to visit a king but after all if one has asoldierly

him or isuppose i should call him the duke of benevento but i confess that ilike old names best</s>  he read my letter when joseph buonaparte handed itto him and then he looked at me with the strangest expression in thosefunny little twinkling eyes of his</s> were you the only messenger</s>  he asked</s> there was one other sir said i</s>  major charpentier of the horsegrenadiers</s> he has not yet arrived said the king of spain</s> if you had seen the legs of his horse sire you would not wonder atit i remarked</s> there may be other reasons said talleyrand and he gave that singularsmile of his</s> well they paid me a compliment or two though they might have said agood deal more and yet have said too little</s>  i bowed myself out andvery glad i was to get away for i

together in his rooms and all my dangers wereforgotten</s>  in the morning i found violette ready for anothertwentyleague stretch</s>  it was my intention to return instantly to theemperors

but whenhis eyes fell upon me he dropped the pen on to the chart and he sprangup with a look in his pale face which struck me cold</s> what the deuce are you doing here</s>  he shouted</s>  when he was angry hehad a voice like a peacock</s> i have the honour to report to you sire said i that i havedelivered your despatch safely to the king of spain</s> what</s>  he yelled and his two eyes

made this request andeven went so far as to promise that he would provide for his own wantsand cease to be an expense to the british government if it were grantedto him</s>  but his guardians knew

had been taken in the battle and we were left withsilent guns and empty caissons</s>  our cavalry too was in a deplorablecondition and my own brigade had been destroyed in the charge atcraonne</s>  then came the news that the enemy had taken paris that thecitizens had mounted the white cockade and finally most terrible ofall that marmont and his corps had gone over to the bourbons</s>  we lookedat each other and asked how many more of our generals were going to turnagainst us</s>  already there were jourdan marmont murat bernadotte andjominithough nobody minded much about jomini for

to say that he wished tosee me</s> he had a suite of rooms at the end of the gallery of francis the firstnot very far from those of the emperor</s>  in the antechamber were waitingtwo men whom i knew
