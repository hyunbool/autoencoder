 adulfo sanchez of montereyat last after so many years i have the pleasure of reintroducing youto prince otto whom you will remember a very little fellow nobigger in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by yourkind hand</s>  the sight of his name will carry you back to an old woodenhouse embowered in creepers a house that was far gone in therespectable stages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the greengarden in which it stood and that yet was a seatraveller in itsyounger days and had come round the horn piecemeal in the belly of aship and might have heard the seamen stamping and shouting and the noteof the boatswains whistle</s>  it will recall to you the nondescriptinhabitants now so widely scatteredthe two horses the dog and thefour cats some of them still looking in your face as you read theselinesthe poor lady so unfortunately married to an authorthe chinaboy by this time perhaps baiting his line by the banks of a river inthe flowery landand in particular the scot who was then sickapparently unto death and whom you did so much to cheer and keep ingood behaviour</s> you may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs so soon ashe had his health again completely you may remember the fortune he wasto earn the journeys he was to go upon the delights he was to enjoyand confer and among other matters the masterpiece he was to make ofprince otto</s> well we will not give in that we are finally beaten</s>  we readtogether in those days the story of braddock and how as he was carrieddying from the scene of his defeat he promised himself to do betteranother time a story that will always touch a brave heart and a dyingspeech worthy of a more fortunate commander</s>  i try to be of braddocksmind</s>  i still mean to get my health again i still purpose by hook orcrook this book or the next to launch a masterpiece and i stillintendsomehow some time or otherto see your face and to hold yourhand</s> meanwhile this little

the bygone state ofgrnewald</s>  an independent principality an infinitesimal member of thegerman empire she played for several centuries her part in thediscord of europe and at last in the ripeness of time and at thespiriting of several bald diplomatists vanished like a morning ghost</s> less fortunate than poland she left not a regret behind her and thevery memory of her boundaries has faded</s> it was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood</s>  many streamstook their beginning in the glens of grnewald turning mills for theinhabitants</s>  there was one town mittwalden and many brown woodenhamlets climbing roof above roof along the steep bottom of dells andcommunicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents</s>  thehum of watermills the splash of running water the clean odour of pinesawdust the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerablearmy of the mountain pines the dropping fire of huntsmen the dullstroke of the woodaxe intolerable roads fresh trout for supper in theclean bare chamber of an inn and the song of birds and the music of thevillagebellsthese were the recollections of the grnewald tourist</s> north and east the foothills of grnewald sank with varying profileinto a vast plain</s>  on these sides many small states bordered with theprincipality gerolstein an extinct grand duchy among the number</s>  onthe south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of seaboardbohemia celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears and inhabited bya people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart</s>  severalintermarriages had in the course of centuries united the crownedfamilies of grnewald and maritime bohemia and the last prince ofgrnewald whose history i purpose to relate drew his descent throughperdita the only daughter of king florizel the first of bohemia</s>  thatthese intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough manly stockof the first grnewalds was an opinion widely held within the bordersof the principality</s>  the charcoal burner the mountain sawyer thewielder of the broad axe among the congregated pines of grnewald proudof their hard hands proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savagelore looked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character andmanners of the sovereign race</s> the precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to theconjecture of the reader</s>  but for the season of the year which in sucha story is the more important of the two it was already so far forwardin the spring that when mountain people heard horns echoing all dayabout the northwest corner of the principality they told themselvesthat prince otto and his hunt were up and out for the last time till thereturn of autumn</s> at this point the borders of grnewald descend somewhat steeply hereand there breaking into crags and this shaggy and trackless countrystands in a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below</s>  it wastraversed at that period by two roads alone one the imperial highwaybound to brandenau in gerolstein descended the slope obliquely and bythe easiest gradients</s>  the other ran like a fillet across the veryforehead of the hills dipping into savage gorges and wetted by thespray of tiny waterfalls</s>  once it passed beside a certain tower orcastle built sheer upon the margin of a formidable cliff andcommanding a vast prospect of the skirts of grnewald and the busyplains of gerolstein</s>  the felsenburg so this tower was called servednow as a prison now as a huntingseat and for all it stood so lonesometo the naked eye with the aid of a good glass the burghers of brandenaucould count its windows from the limetree terrace where they walked atnight</s> in the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads the hornscontinued all day long to scatter tumult and at length as the sunbegan to draw near to the horizon of the plain a rousing triumphannounced the slaughter of the quarry</s>  the first and second huntsman haddrawn somewhat aside and from the summit of a knoll gazed down beforethem on the drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse ofplain</s>  they covered their eyes for the sun was in their faces</s>  theglory of its going down was somewhat pale</s>  through the confused traceryof many thousands of naked poplars the smoke of so many houses and theevening steam ascending from the fields the sails of a windmill on agentle eminence moved very conspicuously like a donkeys ears</s>  and hardby like an open gash the imperial highroad ran straight sunward anartery of travel</s> there is one of natures spiritual ditties that has not yet been set towords or human music the invitation to the road an air continuallysounding in the ears of gipsies and to whose inspiration our nomadicfathers journeyed all their days</s>  the hour the season and the sceneall were in delicate accordance</s>  the air was full of birds of passagesteering westward and northward over grnewald an army of specks to theuplooking eye</s>  and below the great practicable road was bound for thesame quarter</s> but to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard</s> they were indeed in some concern of mind scanning every fold of thesubjacent forest and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatientgestures</s> i do not see him kuno said the first huntsman nowherenot atrace not a hair of the mares tail</s>  no sir hes off broke cover andgot away</s>  why for twopence i would hunt him with the dogs</s> mayhap hes gone home said kuno but without conviction</s> home</s>  sneered the other</s>  i give him twelve days to get home</s>  no itsbegun again its as it was three years ago before he married adisgrace</s>  hereditary prince hereditary fool</s>  there

have his blood and you know it</s> you have him on the brain retorted his companion</s> there he goes</s> he cried the next moment</s> and sure enough about a mile down the mountain a rider on a whitehorse was seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among thetrees on the farther side</s> in ten minutes hell be over the border into gerolstein said kuno</s> its past cure</s> well if he founders that mare ill never forgive him added theother gathering his reins</s> and as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades the sundipped and disappeared and the woods fell instantly into the gravityand greyness of the early night</s> chapter iiin which the prince plays harounalraschidthe night fell upon the prince while he was threading green tracks inthe lower valleys of the wood and though the stars came out overheadand displayed the interminable order of the pinetree pyramids regularand dark like cypresses their light was of small service to a travellerin such lonely paths and from thenceforth he rode at random</s>  theaustere face of nature the uncertain issue of his course the open skyand the free air delighted him like wine and the hoarse chafing of ariver on his left sounded in his ears agreeably</s> it was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded and he issued atlast out of the forest on the firm white highroad</s>  it lay downhillbefore him with a sweeping eastward trend faintly bright between thethickets and otto paused and gazed upon it</s>  so it ran league afterleague still joining others to the farthest ends of europe thereskirting the seasurge here gleaming in the lights of cities and theinnumerable army of tramps and travellers moved upon it in all lands asby a common impulse and were now in all places drawing near to the inndoor and the nights rest</s>  the pictures swarmed and vanished in hisbrain a surge of temptation a beat of all his blood went over him toset spur to the mare and to go on into the unknown for ever</s>  and then itpassed away hunger and fatigue and that habit of middling actionswhich we call common sense resumed their empire and in that changedmood his eye lighted upon two bright windows on his left hand betweenthe road and river</s> he turned off by a byroad and in a few minutes he was knocking withhis whip on the door of a large farmhouse and a chorus of dogs from thefarmyard were making angry answer</s>  a very tall old whiteheaded mancame shading a candle at the summons</s>  he had been of great strength inhis time and of a handsome countenance but now he was fallen away histeeth were quite gone and his voice when he spoke was broken andfalsetto</s> you will pardon me said otto</s>  i am a traveller and have entirelylost my way</s> sir said the old man in a very stately shaky manner you are atthe river farm and i am killian gottesheim at your disposal</s>  we arehere sir at about an equal distance from mittwalden in grnewald andbrandenau in gerolstein six leagues to either and the road excellentbut there is not a winebush not a carters alehouse anywhere between</s> you will have to accept my hospitality for the night rough hospitalityto which i make you freely welcome for sir he added with a bow itis god who sends the guest</s> amen</s>  and i most heartily thank you replied otto bowing in his turn</s> fritz said the old man turning towards the interior lead roundthis gentlemans horse and you sir condescend to enter</s> otto entered a chamber occupying the greater part of the groundfloor ofthe building</s>  it had probably once been divided for the farther end wasraised by a long step above the nearer and the blazing fire and thewhite suppertable seemed to stand upon a das</s>  all around were darkbrassmounted cabinets and cupboards dark shelves carrying ancientcountry crockery guns and antlers and broadside ballads on the wall atall old clock with roses on the dial and down in one corner thecomfortable promise of a winebarrel</s>  it was homely elegant andquaint</s> a powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey mare and when mr</s> killian gottesheim had presented him to his daughter ottilia ottofollowed to the stable as became not perhaps the prince but the goodhorseman</s>  when he returned a smoking omelette and some slices ofhomecured ham were waiting him these were followed by a ragout and acheese and it was not until his guest had entirely satisfied hishunger and the whole party drew about the fire over the winejug thatkillian gottesheims elaborate courtesy permitted him to address aquestion to the prince</s> you have perhaps ridden far sir</s>  he inquired</s> i have as you say ridden far replied otto and as you have seeni was prepared to do justice to your daughters cookery</s> possibly sir from the direction of brandenau</s>  continued killian</s> precisely and i should have slept tonight had i not wandered inmittwalden answered the prince weaving in a patch of truth accordingto the habit of all liars</s> business leads you to mittwalden</s>  was the next question</s> mere curiosity said otto</s>  i have never yet visited the principalityof grnewald</s> a pleasant state sir piped the old man nodding a very pleasantstate and a fine race both pines and people</s>  we reckon ourselves partgrnewalders here lying so near the borders and the river there is allgood grnewald water every drop of it</s>  yes sir a fine state</s>  a man ofgrnewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man ofgerolstein could hardly lift and the pines why deary me there mustbe more pines in that little state sir than people in this whole bigworld</s>  tis twenty years now since i crossed the marshes for we growhomekeepers in old age but i mind it as if it was yesterday</s>  up anddown the road keeps right on from here to mittwalden and nothing allthe way but the good green pinetrees big and little and waterpower</s> waterpower at every step sir</s>  we once sold a bit of forest up therebeside the highroad and the sight of minted money that we got for ithas set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in grnewald wouldamount to</s> i suppose you see nothing of the prince</s>  inquired otto</s> no said the young man speaking for the first time nor want to</s> why so</s>  is he so much disliked</s>  asked otto</s> not what you might call disliked replied the old gentleman butdespised sir</s> indeed said the prince somewhat faintly</s> yes sir despised nodded killian filling a long pipe and to myway of thinking justly despised</s>  here is a man with greatopportunities and what does he do with them</s>  he hunts and he dressesvery prettilywhich is a thing to be ashamed of in a manand he actsplays and if he does aught else the news of it has not come here</s> yet these are all innocent said otto</s>  what would you have himdomake war</s> no sir replied the old man</s>  but here it is i have been fifty yearsupon this river farm and wrought in it day in day out i haveploughed and sowed and reaped and risen early and waked late and thisis the upshot that all these years it has supported me and my familyand been the best friend that ever i had set aside my wife and nowwhen my time comes i leave it a better farm than when i found it</s>  so itis if a man works hearty in the order of nature he gets bread and hereceives comfort and whatever he touches breeds</s>
 and it humbly appearsto me if that prince was to labour on his throne as i have labouredand wrought in my farm he would find both an increase and a blessing</s> i believe with you sir otto said and yet the parallel is inexact</s> for the farmers life is natural and simple but the princes is bothartificial and complicated</s>  it is easy to do right in the one andexceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other</s>  if your crop isblighted you can take off your bonnet and say gods will be donebut if the prince meets with a reverse he may have to blame himself forthe attempt</s>  and perhaps if all the kings in europe were to confinethemselves to innocent amusement the subjects would be the better off</s> ay said the young man fritz you are in the right of it there</s>  thatwas a true word spoken</s>  and i see you are like me a good patriot and anenemy to princes</s> otto was somewhat abashed at this deduction and he made haste to changehis ground</s>  but said he you surprise me by what you say of thisprince otto</s>  i have heard him i must own more favourably painted</s>  iwas told he was in his heart a good fellow and the enemy of no onebut himself</s> and so he is sir said the girl a very handsome pleasant princeand we know some who would shed their blood for him</s> o</s>  kuno</s>  said fritz</s>  an ignoramus</s> ay kuno to be sure quavered the old farmer</s>  well since thisgentleman is a stranger to these parts and curious about the prince ido believe that story might divert him</s>  this kuno you must know siris one of the hunt servants and a most ignorant intemperate man aright grnewalder as we say in gerolstein</s>  we know him well in thishouse for he has come as far as here after his stray dogs and i makeall welcome sir without account of state or nation</s>  and indeedbetween gerolstein and grnewald the peace has held so long that theroads stand open like my door and a man will make no more of thefrontier than the very birds themselves</s> ay said otto it has been a long peacea peace of centuries</s> centuries as you say returned killian the more the pity that itshould not be for ever</s>  well sir this kuno was one day in fault andotto who has a quick temper up with his whip and thrashed him they dosay soundly</s>  kuno took it as best he could but at last he broke outand dared the prince to throw his whip away and wrestle like a man forwe are all great at wrestling in these parts and its so that wegenerally settle our disputes</s>  well sir the prince did so and beinga weakly creature found the tables turned for the man whom he had justbeen thrashing like a negro slave lifted him with a back grip and threwhim heels overhead</s> he broke his bridlearm cried fritzand some say his nose</s>  servehim right say i</s>  man to man which is the better at that</s> and then</s>  asked otto</s> o then kuno carried him home and they were the best of friends fromthat day forth</s>  i dont say its a discreditable story you observecontinued mr</s>  gottesheim but its droll and thats the fact</s>  a manshould think before he strikes for as my nephew says man to man wasthe old valuation</s> now if you were to ask me said otto i should perhaps surprise you</s> i think it was the prince that conquered</s> and sir you would be right replied killian seriously</s>  in the eyesof god i do not question but you would be right but men sir look atthese things differently and they laugh</s> they made a song of it observed fritz</s>  how does it go</s> tatumtara</s> </s> </s> </s> well interrupted otto who had no great anxiety to hear the songthe prince is young he may yet mend</s> not so young by your leave cried fritz</s>  a man of forty</s> thirtysix corrected mr</s>  gottesheim</s> o cried ottilia in obvious disillusion a man of middle age</s>  andthey said he was so handsome when he was young</s> and bald too added fritz</s> otto passed his hand among his locks</s>  at that moment he was far fromhappy and even the tedious evenings at mittwalden palace began to smileupon him by comparison</s> o sixandthirty</s>  he protested</s>  a man is not yet old atsixandthirty</s>  i am that age myself</s> i should have taken you for more sir piped the old farmer</s>  but ifthat be so you are of an age with master ottekin as people call himand i would wager a crown have done more service in your time</s>  thoughit seems young by comparison with men of a great age like me yet itssome way through life for all that and the mere fools and fiddlers arebeginning to grow weary and to look old</s>  yes sir by sixandthirty ifa man be a follower of gods laws he should have made himself a homeand a good name to live by he should have got a wife and a blessing onhis marriage and his works as the word says should begin to followhim</s> ah well the prince is married cried fritz with a coarse burst oflaughter</s> that seems to entertain you sir said otto</s> ay said the young boor</s>  did you not know that</s>  i thought all europeknew it</s>  and he added a pantomime of a nature to explain his accusationto the dullest</s> ah sir said mr</s>  gottesheim it is very plain that you are not fromhereabouts</s>  but the truth is that the whole princely family and courtare rips and rascals not one to mend another</s>  they live sir inidleness andwhat most commonly follows itcorruption</s>  the princesshas a lover a baron as he calls himself from east prussia and theprince is so little of a man sir that he holds the candle</s>  nor is thatthe worst of it for this foreigner and his paramour are suffered totransact the state affairs while the prince takes the salary and leavesall things to go to wrack</s>  there will follow upon this some manifestjudgment which though i am old i may survive to see</s> good man you are in the wrong about gondremark said fritz showing agreatly increased animation but for all the rest you speak the godstruth like a good patriot</s>  as for the prince if he would take andstrangle his wife i would forgive him yet</s> nay fritz said the old man that would be to add iniquity to evil</s> for you perceive sir he continued once more addressing himself tothe unfortunate prince this otto has himself to thank for thesedisorders</s>  he has his young wife and his principality and he has swornto cherish both</s> sworn at the altar</s>  echoed fritz</s>  but put your faith in princes</s> well sir he leaves them both to an adventurer from east prussiapursued the farmer leaves the girl to be seduced and to go on from badto worse till her names become a taproom byword and she not yettwenty leaves the country to be overtaxed and bullied with armamentsand jockied into warwar</s>  cried otto</s> so they say sir those that watch their ongoings say to warasseverated killian</s>  well sir that is very sad it is a sad thing forthis poor wicked girl to go down to hell with peoples curses its asad thing for a tight little happy country to be misconducted butwhoever may complain i humbly conceive sir that this otto cannot</s> what he has worked for that he has got and may god have pity on hissoul for a great and a silly sinners</s> he has broke his oath then he is a perjurer</s>  he takes the money andleaves the work why then plainly hes a thief</s>  a cuckold he wasbefore and a fool by birth</s>  better me that</s>  cried fritz and snappedhis fingers</s> and now sir you will see a little continued the farmer why wethink so poorly of this prince otto</s>  theres such a thing as a man beingpious and honest in the private way and there is such a thing sir asa public virtue but when a man has neither the lord lighten him</s>  eventhis gondremark that fritz here thinks so much ofay interrupted fritz gondremarks the man for me</s>  i would we hadhis like in gerolstein</s> he is a bad man said the old farmer shaking his head and there wasnever good begun by the breach of gods commandments</s>  but so far i willgo with you he is a man that works for what he has</s> i tell you hes the hope of grnewald cried fritz</s>  he doesnt suitsome of your highanddry old ancient ideas but hes a downrightmodern mana man of the new lights and the progress of the age</s>  he doessome things wrong so they all do but he has the peoples interestsnext his heart and you mark meyou sir who are a liberal and theenemy of

doingstomorrow said the old man</s>  for there is one thing certain thatthis gondremark has one foot in the court backstairs and the other inthe masons lodges</s>  he gives himself out sir for what nowadays theycall a patriot a man from east prussia</s> give himself out</s>  cried fritz</s>  he is</s>  he is to lay by his title assoon as the republic is declared i heard it in a speech</s> lay by

mystrength</s>  if you would show me to a bed i should be grateful</s> ottilia a candle</s>  said the old man</s>  indeed sir you look paley</s>  alittle cordial water</s>  no</s>  then follow me i beseech you and i willbring you to the strangers bed</s>  you are not the first by many who hasslept well below my roof continued the old gentleman mounting thestairs before his guest for good food honest wine a gratefulconscience and a little pleasant chat before a man retires are worthall the possets and apothecarys drugs</s>  see sir and here he opened adoor and ushered otto into a little whitewashed sleepingroom here youare in port</s>  it is small but it is airy and the sheets are clean andkept in lavender</s>  the window too looks out above the river andtheres no music like a little rivers</s>  it plays the same tune andthats the favourite over and over again and yet does not weary of itlike men fiddlers</s>  it takes the mind out of doors and though we shouldbe grateful for good houses there is after all no house like godsoutofdoors</s>  and lastly sir it quiets a man down like saying hisprayers</s>  so here sir i take my kind leave of you until tomorrow andit is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a prince</s> and the old man with the twentieth courteous inclination left hisguest alone</s> chapter iiiin which the prince comforts age and beauty and delivers a lecture ondiscretion in lovethe prince was early abroad in the time of the first chorus of birdsof the pure and quiet air of the slanting sunlight and the milelongshadows</s>  to one who had passed a miserable night the freshness of thathour was tonic and reviving to steal a march upon his slumberingfellows to be the adam of the coming day composed and fortified hisspirits and the prince breathing deep and pausing as he went walkedin the wet fields beside his shadow and was glad</s> a trellised path led down into the valley of the brook and he turned tofollow it</s>  the stream was a breakneck bolling highland river</s>  hard bythe farm it leaped a little precipice in a thick greymares tail oftwisted filaments and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn</s>  intothe middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded shelving to a capeand thither otto scrambled and sat down to ponder</s> soon the sun struck through the screen of branches and thin early leavesthat made a hanging bower above the fall and the golden lights andflitting shadows fell upon and marbled the surface of that seething potand rays plunged deep among the turning waters and a spark as brightas a diamond lit upon the swaying eddy</s>  it began to grow warm whereotto lingered warm and heady the lights swam weaving their mazeacross the shaken pool on the impending rock reflections danced likebutterflies and the air was fanned by the waterfall as by a swingingcurtain</s> otto who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid phantoms ofremorse and jealousy instantly fell dead in love with thatsunchequered echoing corner</s>  holding his feet he stared out of adrowsy trance wondering admiring musing losing his way amonguncertain thoughts</s>  there is nothing that so apes the external bearingof free will as

beauty that comes of happiness andhealth</s>  but her confusion lent her for the moment an additional charm</s> goodmorning said otto rising and moving towards her</s>  i arose earlyand was in a

dismounted and as he did so a memory came backto him a whisper of dishonest grooms and stolen corn once heard longforgotten and now recurring in the nick of opportunity</s>  he crossed thebridge and

closed on her at firstwith a horror of fainting but when she ceased to struggle kindlyembracing her</s>  so she was taken home for a little from all her toilsand sorrows to her fathers arms</s>  and there in the meanwhile her bodylay exposed by the highwayside in tattered finery and on either handfrom the woods the birds came flying by and calling upon others anddebated in their own tongue this

hatred</s>  but the way there wasnothing to the journey back for the mere sight of the place ofbusiness as well as every detail of its transactions was enough topoison life for any finsbury</s> josephs name was still over the door it was he who still signed thecheques but this was only policy on the part of morris and designed todiscourage other members of the tontine</s>  in reality the

whole careerto have hiscostume examined his collar pulled up the presence of his mittensverified and to be taken out and brought home in custody like aninfant with a nurse</s>  at the thought of it his soul would swell withvenom and he would make haste to hang up his hat and coat and thedetested mittens and slink upstairs to julia and his notebooks</s>  thedrawingroom at least was sacred from

unfair</s>  here then were all the elements ofcompromise assembled and morris suddenly beholding his seven thousandeight hundred pounds restored to him and himself dismissed from thevicissitudes of the leather trade hastened the next morning to theoffice of his cousin michael</s> michael was something of a public character</s>  launched upon the law at avery early age and quite without protectors he had become a traffickerin shady affairs</s>  he was known to be the man for a lost cause it wasknown he could extract testimony from a stone and interest from a goldmine and his office

far to sober him and it was knownthat in the matter of investments he preferred the solid to thebrilliant</s>  what was yet more to the purpose he had been all his life aconsistent scoffer at the finsbury tontine</s> it was therefore with little fear for the result that morris presentedhimself before his cousin and proceeded feverishly to set forth hisscheme</s>  for near upon a quarter of an

unusual act ofinsubordination had already troubled him and these mutinous words nowsounded ominously in his ears</s>  he looked at the old gentleman uneasily</s> upon one occasion many years before when joseph was delivering alecture the audience had revolted in a body finding their entertainersomewhat dry they had taken the question of amusement into their ownhands and the lecturer along with the board schoolmaster the baptistclergyman and a workingmans candidate who made up his bodyguard wasultimately driven from the scene</s>  morris had not been present on thatfatal day if he had he

in a tweed suit on thecontinent of europe and years of galignanis messenger having atlength undermined his eyesight he suddenly remembered the rivers ofassyria and came to london to consult an oculist</s>  from the oculist tothe dentist and from both to the physician the step appearsinevitable presently he was in the hands of sir faraday robed inventilating cloth and sent to bournemouth and to that domineeringbaronet who was his only friend upon his native soil he was nowreturning to report</s>  the case of these tweedsuited wanderers is unique</s> we have all seen them entering the

halfcrown poorer at the years end and thehotelkeepers of europe about the same date would be mourning a smallbut quite observable decline in profits</s>  and that would be literallyall</s>  perhaps the old gentleman thought something of the sort for helooked melancholy enough as he pulled his bare grey head back into thecarriage and the train smoked under the bridge and forth with everquickening speed across the mingled heaths and woods of the new forest</s> not many hundred yards beyond browndean however a sudden jarring ofbrakes set everybodys teeth on edge and there was a brutal stoppage</s> morris finsbury was aware of a confused uproar of voices and sprang tothe window</s>  women were screaming men were tumbling from the windows onthe track the guard was crying to them to stay where they were at thesame time the train began to gather way and move very slowly backwardtoward browndean and the next moment all these various sounds wereblotted out in the apocalyptic whistle and the thundering onslaught ofthe down express</s> the actual collision morris did not hear</s>  perhaps he fainted</s>  he had awild dream of having seen the carriage double up and fall to pieces likea pantomime trick and sure enough when he came to himself he waslying on the bare earth and under the open sky</s>  his head ached savagelyhe carried his hand to his brow and was not surprised to see it redwith blood</s>  the air was filled with an intolerable throbbing roarwhich he expected to find die away with the return of consciousness andinstead of that it seemed but to swell the louder and to pierce the morecruelly through his ears</s>  it was a raging bellowing thunder like aboilerriveting factory</s> and now curiosity began to stir and he sat up and looked about him</s>  thetrack at this point ran in a sharp curve about a wooded hillock all ofthe near side was heaped with the wreckage of the bournemouth trainthat of the express was mostly hidden by the trees and just at theturn under clouds of vomiting steam and piled about with cairns ofliving coal lay what remained of the two engines one upon the other</s> on the heathy margin of the line were many people running to and froand crying aloud as they ran and many others lying motionless likesleeping tramps</s> morris suddenly drew an inference</s>  there has been an accident</s>  thoughthe and was elated at his perspicacity</s>  almost at the same time his eyelighted on john who lay close by as white as paper</s>  poor old john</s> poor old cove</s>  he thought the schoolboy expression popping forth fromsome forgotten treasury and he took his brothers hand in his withchildish tenderness</s>  it was perhaps the touch that recalled him atleast john opened his eyes sat suddenly up and after severalineffectual movements of his lips whats the row</s>  said he in aphantom voice</s> the din of that devils smithy still thundered in their ears</s>  let usget away from that morris cried and pointed to the vomit of steamthat still spouted from the broken engines</s>  and the pair helped eachother up and stood and quaked and wavered and stared about them at thescene of death</s> just then they were approached by a party of men who had alreadyorganised themselves for the purposes of rescue</s> are you hurt</s>  cried one of these a young fellow with the sweatstreaming down his pallid face and who by the way he was treated wasevidently the doctor</s> morris shook his head and the young man nodding grimly handed him abottle of some spirit</s> take a drink of that he said your friend looks as if he needed itbadly</s>  we want every man we can get he added theres terrible workbefore us and nobody should shirk</s>  if you can do no more you can carrya stretcher</s> the doctor was hardly gone before morris under the spur of the dramawoke to the full possession of his wits</s> my god</s>  he cried</s>  uncle joseph</s> yes said john where can he be</s>  he cant be far off</s>  i hope the oldparty isnt damaged</s> come and help me to look said morris with a snap of savagedetermination strangely foreign to his ordinary bearing and then forone moment he broke forth</s>  if hes dead</s>  he cried and shook his fistat heaven</s> to and fro the brothers hurried staring in the faces of the wounded orturning the dead upon their backs</s>  they must have thus examined fortypeople and still there was no word of uncle joseph</s>  but now the courseof their search brought them near the centre of the collision where theboilers were still blowing off steam with a deafening clamour</s>  it was apart of the field not yet gleaned by the rescuing party</s>  the groundespecially on the margin of the wood was full of inequalitieshere apit there a hillock surmounted with a bush of furze</s>  it was a placewhere many bodies might lie concealed and they beat it like pointersafter game</s>  suddenly morris who was leading paused and reached forthhis index with a tragic gesture</s>  john followed the direction of hisbrothers hand</s> in the bottom of a sandy hole lay something that had once been human</s> the face had suffered severely and it was unrecognisable but that wasnot required</s>  the snowy hair the coat of marten the ventilating cloththe hygienic flanneleverything down to the health boots from messrs</s> dall and crumbies identified the body as that

pounds if we hadnt chivied him in the train</s> but there was no sentiment in the face of morris as he gazed upon thedead</s>  gnawing his nails with introverted eyes his brow marked with thestamp of tragic indignation and tragic intellectual effort he stoodthere silent</s>  here was a last injustice he had been robbed while he wasan orphan at school he had been lashed to a decadent leather businesshe had been saddled with miss hazeltine his cousin had been defraudinghim of the tontine and he had borne all this we might almost say withdignity and now they had gone and killed his

morris as he took the corpse by theshoulders</s>  am i to carry him myself</s> they were close upon the borders of the wood in ten or twelve pacesthey were under cover and a little farther back in a sandy clearingof the trees they laid their burthen down and stood and looked at itwith loathing</s> what do you mean to do</s>  whispered john</s> bury him to be sure</s>  responded morris and he opened his pocketknifeand began feverishly to dig</s> youll never make a hand of it with that objected the other</s> if you wont help me you cowardly shirk screamed morris you can goto the devil</s> its the childishest folly said john but no man shall call me acoward and he began to help his brother grudgingly</s> the soil was sandy and light but matted with the roots of thesurrounding firs</s>  gorse tore their hands and as they baled the sandfrom the grave it was often discoloured with their blood</s>  an hourpassed of unremitting energy upon the part of morris of lukewarm helpon that of john and still the trench was barely nine inches in depth</s> into this the body was rudely flung sand was piled upon it and thenmore sand must be dug and gorse had to be cut to pile on that andstill from one end of the sordid mound a pair of feet projected andcaught the light upon their patentleather toes</s>  but by this time thenerves of both were shaken even morris had enough of his grisly

butits the merest nonsense</s>  weve lost it and theres an end</s> i tell you said morris uncle masterman is dead</s>  i know it theresa voice that tells me so</s> well and so is uncle joseph said

we bury him in the cellar whichseems made for it and then all i have to do is to start out and find avenal doctor</s> why cant we leave him where he is</s>  asked john</s> because we know nothing about the country retorted morris</s>  this woodmay be a regular lovers walk</s>  turn your mind to the real difficulty</s> how are we to get him up to bloomsbury</s> various schemes were mooted and rejected</s>  the railway station atbrowndean was of course out of the question for it would now be acentre of curiosity and gossip and of all things they would be leastable to despatch a dead body

view to cheapening the place remarked on this defect</s> well returned the man if you cant sleep two abed youd bettertake a villa residence</s> and then pursued morris theres no water</s>  how do you get yourwater</s> we fill that from the spring replied the carpenter pointing to abig barrel that stood beside the door</s>  the spring aint so very faroff after all and its easy brought in

observed returning to the blighted cottage having along with themthe key which was the symbol of their tenancy a spiritlamp withwhich they fondly told themselves they would be able to cook a pork pieof suitable dimensions and a quart of the worst whisky in hampshire</s> nor was this all they had effected already under the plea that theywere landscapepainters they had hired for dawn on the morrow a lightbut solid twowheeled cart so that when they entered in their newcharacter they were able to tell themselves that the back of thebusiness was already broken</s> john proceeded to get tea while morris foraging about the house waspresently delighted by discovering the lid of the waterbutt upon thekitchen shelf</s>  here then was the packingcase complete in the absenceof straw the blankets which he himself at least had not the smallestintention of using for their present purpose would exactly take theplace of packing and morris as the difficulties began to vanish fromhis path rose almost to the brink of exultation</s>  there was howeverone difficulty not yet faced one upon which his whole scheme depended</s> would john consent to remain alone in the cottage</s>  he had not yet daredto put the question</s> it was with high goodhumour that the pair sat down to the deal tableand proceeded to fallto on the pork pie</s>  morris retailed the discoveryof the lid and the great vance was pleased to applaud by beating on thetable with his fork in true musichall style</s> thats the dodge he cried</s>  i always said a waterbutt was what youwanted for this business</s> of course

not do for both of us to appear in london we could never concealthe absence of the old man</s> johns jaw dropped</s> o come</s>  he cried</s>  you can stay in this hole yourself</s>  i wont</s> the

thedoorwayand was deposited at length with a formidable convulsion inthe far end of the lobby which it almost blocked</s>  the artisans of thisvictory smiled upon each other as the dust subsided</s>  it was true theyhad smashed a bust of apollo and ploughed the wall into deep ruts butat least they were no longer one of the public spectacles of london</s> well sir said the vanman i never see such a job</s> gideon eloquently expressed his concurrence in this sentiment bypressing a couple of sovereigns in the mans hand</s> make it three sir and ill stand sam to everybody here</s>  cried thelatter and this having been done the whole body of volunteer portersswarmed into the van which drove off in the direction of the nearestreliable publichouse</s>  gideon closed the door on their departure andturned to julia their eyes met the most uncontrollable mirth seizedupon them both and they made the house ring with their laughter</s>  thencuriosity awoke in julias mind and she went and examined the box andmore especially the label</s> this is the strangest thing that ever happened she said with anotherburst of laughter</s>  it is certainly morriss handwriting and i had aletter from him only this morning telling me to expect a barrel</s>  isthere a barrel coming too do you think mr</s>  forsyth</s> statuary with care fragile read gideon aloud from the paintedwarning on the box</s>  then you were told nothing about this</s> no responded julia</s>  o mr</s>  forsyth dont you think we might take apeep at it</s> yes indeed cited gideon</s>  just let me have a hammer</s> come down and ill show you where it is cried julia</s>  the shelf istoo high for me to reach and opening the door of the kitchen stairshe bade gideon follow her</s>  they found both the hammer and a chisel butgideon was surprised to see no sign of a servant</s>  he also discoveredthat miss hazeltine had a very pretty little foot and ankle and thediscovery embarrassed him so much that he was glad to fall at once uponthe packingcase</s> he worked hard and earnestly and dealt his blows with the precision ofa blacksmith julia the while standing silently by his side andregarding rather the workman than the work</s>  he was a handsome fellowshe told herself she had never seen such beautiful arms</s>  and suddenlyas though he had overheard these thoughts gideon turned and smiled toher</s>  she too smiled and coloured and the double change became her soprettily that gideon forgot to turn away his eyes and swinging thehammer with a will discharged a smashing blow on his own knuckles</s>  withadmirable presence of mind he crushed down an oath and substituted theharmless comment butter fingers</s>  but the pain was sharp his nervewas shaken and after an abortive trial he found he must desist fromfurther operations</s> in a moment julia was off to the pantry in a moment she was back againwith a basin of water and a sponge and had begun to bathe his woundedhand</s> i am dreadfully sorry</s>  said gideon apologetically</s>  if i had had anymanners i should have opened the box first and smashed my handafterward</s>  it feels much better he added</s>  i assure you it does</s> and now i think you are well enough to direct operations said she</s> tell me what to do and ill be your workman</s> a very pretty workman said gideon rather forgetting himself</s>  sheturned and looked at him with a suspicion of a frown and theindiscreet young man was glad to direct her attention to thepackingcase</s>  the bulk of the work had been accomplished and presentlyjulia had burst through the last barrier and disclosed a zone of straw</s> in a moment they were kneeling side by side engaged like haymakersthe next they were rewarded with a glimpse of something white andpolished and the next again laid bare an unmistakable marble leg</s> he is surely a very athletic person said julia</s> i never saw anything like it responded gideon</s>  his muscles stand outlike penny rolls</s> another leg was soon disclosed and then what seemed to be a third</s>  thisresolved itself however into a knotted club resting upon a pedestal</s> it is a hercules cried gideon i might have guessed that from hiscalf</s>  im supposed to be rather partial to statuary but when it comesto hercules the police should interfere</s>  i should say he addedglancing with disaffection at the swollen leg that this was about thebiggest and the worst in europe</s>  what in heavens name can have inducedhim to come here</s> i suppose nobody else would have a gift of him said julia</s>  and forthat matter i think we could have done without the monster very well</s> o dont say that returned gideon</s>  this has been one of the mostamusing experiences of my life</s> i dont think youll forget it very soon said julia</s>  your hand willremind you</s> well i suppose i must be going said gideon reluctantly</s> no pleaded julia</s>  why should you</s>  stay and have tea with me</s> if i thought you really wished me to stay said gideon looking at hishat of course i should only be too delighted</s> what a silly person you must take me for</s>  returned the girl</s>  why ofcourse i do and besides i want some cakes for tea and ive nobody tosend</s>  here is the latchkey</s> gideon put on his hat with alacrity and casting one look at misshazeltine and another at the legs of hercules threw open the door anddeparted on his errand</s> he returned with a large bag of the choicest and most tempting of cakesand tartlets and found julia in the act of spreading a small teatablein the lobby</s> the rooms are all in such a state she cried that i thought weshould be more cosy and comfortable in our own lobby and under our ownvine and statuary</s> ever so much better cried gideon delightedly</s> o what adorable cream tarts</s>  said julia opening the bag and thedearest little cherry tartlets with all the cherries spilled out intothe cream</s> yes said gideon concealing his dismay i knew they would mixbeautifully the woman behind the counter told me so</s> now said julia as they began their little festival i am going toshow you morriss letter read it aloud please perhaps theressomething i have missed</s> gideon took the letter and spreading it out on his knee read asfollows dear juliai write you from browndean where we are stopping over for a few days</s>  uncle was much shaken in that dreadful accident of which i dare say you have seen the account</s>  tomorrow i leave him here with john and come up alone but before that you will have received a barrel containing specimens for a

seems to be nothing about the monument andhe nodded as he spoke at the marble legs</s>  miss hazeltine hecontinued would you mind me asking a few questions</s> certainly not replied julia and if you can make me understand whymorris has sent a statue of hercules instead of a barrel containingspecimens for a friend i shall be grateful till my dying day</s>  and whatare specimens for a friend</s> i havent a guess said gideon</s>  specimens are usually bits of stonebut rather smaller than our friend the monument</s>  still that is not thepoint</s>  are you quite alone in this big house</s> yes i am at present returned julia</s>  i came up before them toprepare the house and get another servant</s>  but i couldnt get one iliked</s> then you are utterly alone said gideon in amazement</s>  are you notafraid</s> no responded julia stoutly</s>  i dont see why i should be more afraidthan you would be i am weaker of course but when i found i must sleepalone in the house i bought a revolver wonderfully cheap and made theman show me how to use it</s> and how do you use it</s>  demanded gideon much amused at her courage</s> why said she with a smile you pull the little trigger thing ontop and then pointing it very low for it springs up as you fire youpull the underneath little trigger thing and it goes off as well as ifa man had done it</s> and how often have you used it</s>  asked gideon</s> o i have not used it yet said the determined young lady but i knowhow and that makes me wonderfully courageous especially when ibarricade my door with a chest of drawers</s> im awfully glad they are coming back soon said gideon</s>  thisbusiness strikes me as excessively unsafe if it goes on much longer icould provide you with a maiden aunt of mine or my landlady if youpreferred</s> lend me an aunt</s>  cried julia</s>  o what generosity</s>  i begin to think itmust have been you that sent the hercules</s> believe me cried the young man i admire you too much to send yousuch an

in a startled voice and she ran to the doorand opened it</s> it was indeed morris that stood before them not the morris of ordinarydays but a wildlooking fellow pale and haggard with bloodshot eyesand

histongue was loosed and he overwhelmed the girl with torrents of abuse</s> such fire such directness such a choice of ungentlemanly languagenone had ever before suspected morris to possess and the

julia had scarcely handed the key to morris before an empty hansom drovesmartly into john street</s>  it was hailed by both men and as the cabmandrew up his restive horse morris made a dash into the

specimens</s> i dont know about specimens replied bill but the party as receivedthe barrel i mean raised a sight of trouble</s> whats that</s>  cried morris in the agitation of the moment pressing apenny into the mans hand</s> you see sir the barrel arrived at onethirty</s>  no one claimed it tillabout three when a small sicklylooking gentleman probably a curatecame up and sez he have you got

for a pot of beer</s>  he had lost his book too and thereceipts and his men were all as mortal as himself</s>  o they were alllikeand bill paused for a similelike lords</s>  the superintendentsacked them on the spot</s> o come but thats not so bad said morris with a bursting sigh</s>  hecouldnt tell where he took the packingcase then</s> not he said bill nor yet nothink else</s> and whatwhat did pitman do</s>  asked morris</s> o he went off with the barrel in a fourwheeler very trembling likereplied bill</s>  i dont believe hes a gentleman as has good health</s> well so the barrels gone said morris half to himself</s> you may depend on that sir returned the porter</s>  but you had bettersee the superintendent</s> not in the least its of no account said morris</s>  it only containedspecimens</s>  and he walked hastily away</s> ensconced once more in a hansom he proceeded to reconsider hisposition</s>  suppose he thought suppose he should accept defeat anddeclare his

  and dont send me to gaol  he will want a fortune</s> o this seems to be a very onesided business exclaimed morris</s> theres not so much in this method as i was led to think</s>  he crumpledthe paper up and threw it down and then the next moment picked it upagain and ran it over</s>  it seems its on the financial point that myposition is weakest he reflected</s>  is there positively no way

theres onecomfort its not morally wrong i can try it on with a clearconscience and even if i was found out i wouldnt greatlycaremorally i mean</s>  and then if i succeed and if pitman isstaunchtheres

shopfronts had begunto glitter down the endless streets the lobby was pitchdark and asthe devil would have it morris barked his shins and sprawled all hislength over the pedestal of hercules</s>  the pain was sharp his temper wasalready thoroughly undermined by a last misfortune his hand closed onthe hammer as he fell and in a spasm of childish irritation he turnedand struck at the offending statue</s>  there was a splintering crash</s> o lord what have i done next</s>  wailed morris and he groped his way tofind a candle</s>  yes he reflected as he stood with the light in hishand and looked upon the mutilated leg from which about a pound ofmuscle was detached</s>  yes i have destroyed a genuine antique i may bein for thousands</s>  and then there sprung up in his bosom a sort of angryhope</s>  let me see he thought</s>  julias got rid of theres nothing toconnect me with that beast forsyth the men were all drunk and whatsbetter theyve been all discharged</s>  o come i think

it was indeed no more ambitious atask for de lesseps with all his men and horses to attack the hills ofpanama than for a single slim young gentleman with no previousexperience of labour in a quarry to measure himself against thatbloated monster on his pedestal</s>  and yet the pair were well encounteredon the one side bulkon the other genuine heroic fire</s> down you shall come you great big ugly brute</s>  cried morris aloudwith something of that passion which swept the parisian mob against thewalls of the bastille</s>  down you shall come this night</s>  ill have noneof you in my lobby</s>

fathom andhalf in his stockingfeetoffered a preliminary obstacle to thisattack</s>  but here in the first skirmish of the battle intellect alreadybegan to triumph over matter</s>  by means of a pair of library steps theinjured householder gained a posture of advantage and with greatswipes of the coalaxe proceeded to decapitate the brute</s> two hours later what had been the erect image of a

sentiment of triumphlooked round upon the scene of his achievements</s>  yes he could deny allknowledge of it now the lobby beyond the fact that it was partlyruinous betrayed no trace of the passage of hercules</s>  but it was aweary morris that crept up to bed his arms and shoulders ached thepalms of his hands burned from the rough kisses of the coalaxe andthere was one smarting finger that stole continually to his mouth</s>  sleeplong delayed to visit the dilapidated hero and with the first peep ofday it had again deserted him</s> the morning as though to accord with his disastrous fortunes dawnedinclemently</s>  an easterly gale was shouting in the streets flaws of rainangrily assailed the windows and as morris dressed the draught fromthe fireplace vividly played about his legs</s> i think he could not help observing bitterly that with all i haveto bear they might have given me decent weather</s> there was no bread in the house for miss hazeltine like all women leftto themselves had subsisted entirely upon cake</s>  but some of this wasfound and along with what the poets call a glass of fair cold watermade up a semblance of a morning meal and then down he sat undauntedlyto his delicate task</s> nothing can be more interesting than the study of signatures writtenas they are before meals and after during indigestion andintoxication written when the signer is

proofs</s>  a clerk would simply gibe at themsaid he</s>  well theres nothing else but tracing possible</s> he waited till a squall had passed and there came a blink of scowlingdaylight</s>  then he went to the window and in the face of all john streettraced his uncles signature</s>  it was a poor thing at the best</s>  but itmust do said he as he stood gazing woefully on his handiwork</s>  hesdead anyway</s>  and he filled up the cheque for a couple of hundred andsallied forth for the anglopatagonian bank</s> there at the desk at which he was accustomed to transact business andwith as much indifference as he could assume morris presented theforged cheque to the big redbearded scots teller</s>  the teller seemed toview it with surprise and as he turned it this way and that and evenscrutinised the signature with a magnifyingglass his surprise appearedto warm into disfavour</s>  begging to be excused for a moment he passedaway into the rearmost quarters of the bank whence

this time they had reached the corner of the bystreet and therewas the faithful shoeblack standing by the horses heads with asplendid assumption of dignity and there was the piano figuringforlorn upon the cart while the rain beat upon its unprotected sidesand trickled down its elegantly varnished legs</s> the shoeblack was again put in requisition to bring five or six strongfellows from the neighbouring publichouse and the last battle of thecampaign opened</s>  it is probable that mr</s>  gideon forsyth had not yettaken his seat in the train for hampton court before michael opened thedoor of the chambers and the grunting porters deposited the broadwoodgrand in the middle of the floor</s> and now said the lawyer after he had sent the men about theirbusiness one more precaution</s>  we must leave him the key of the pianoand we must contrive that he shall find it</s>  let me see</s>  and he built asquare tower of cigars upon the top of the instrument and dropped thekey into the middle</s> poor young man said the artist as they descended the stairs</s> he is in a devil of a position assented michael drily</s>  itll bracehim up</s> and that reminds me observed

nothing toprocrastinate the crash and when it came when prying eyes began to beapplied to every joint of his behaviour two questions could not fail tobe addressed sooner or later to a speechless and perspiring insolvent</s> where is mr</s>  joseph finsbury</s>  and how about your visit to the bank</s> questions how easy to put</s> ye gods how impossible to answer</s>  the manto whom they should be addressed went certainly to gaol andeh</s>  whatwas this</s> possibly to the gallows</s>  morris was trying to shave when thisidea struck him and he laid the razor down</s>  here in michaels wordswas the total disappearance of a valuable uncle here was a time ofinexplicable conduct on the part of a nephew who had been in bad bloodwith the old man any time these seven years what a chance

mind morris finsburydescended to the hall of the house in john street still halfshaven</s> there was a letter in the box he knew the handwriting john at last</s> well i think i might have been spared

stay hes as helpless as the dead</s>  and then he broke forth againcomplains does he</s>  and hes never even heard of bent pitman</s>  if he hadwhat i have on my mind he might complain with a good grace</s> but these were not honest arguments or not wholly honest there was astruggle in the mind of morris he could not disguise from himself thathis brother john was miserably situated at browndean without newswithout money without bedclothes without society or anyentertainment and by the time he had been shaved and picked a hastybreakfast at a coffee tavern morris had arrived at a compromise</s> poor johnny he said to himself hes in an awful box</s>  i cant sendhim coins but ill tell you what ill do ill send him the pinkunitll cheer john up and besides itll do his credit good gettinganything by post</s> accordingly on his way to the leather business whither he proceededaccording to his thrifty habit on foot morris purchased anddespatched a single copy of that enlivening
