falka reminiscenceby joseph conradseveral of us all more or less connected with the sea were dining ina small riverhostelry not more than thirty miles from london and lessthan twenty from that shallow and dangerous puddle to which our coastingmen give the grandiose name of german ocean</s>  and through the widewindows we had a view of the thames an enfilading view down the lowerhope reach</s>  but the dinner was execrable and all the feast was for theeyes</s> that flavour of saltwater which for so many of us had been the verywater of life permeated our talk</s>  he who hath known the bitterness ofthe ocean shall have its taste forever in his mouth</s>  but one or twoof us pampered by the life of the land complained of hunger</s>  it wasimpossible to swallow any of that stuff</s>  and indeed there was a strangemustiness in everything</s>  the wooden diningroom stuck out over the mudof the shore like a lacustrine dwelling the planks of the floor seemedrotten a decrepit old waiter tottered pathetically to and fro beforean antediluvian and wormeaten sideboard the chipped plates might havebeen disinterred from some kitchen midden near an inhabited lake andthe chops recalled times more ancient still</s>  they brought forcibly toones mind the night of ages when the primeval man evolving the firstrudiments of cookery from his dim consciousness scorched lumps of fleshat a fire of sticks in the company of other good fellows then gorgedand happy sat him back among the gnawed bones to tell his artless talesof experiencethe tales of hunger and huntand of women perhaps</s> but luckily the wine happened to be as old as the waiter</s>  socomparatively empty but upon the whole fairly happy we sat back andtold our artless tales</s>  we talked of the sea and all its works</s>  thesea never changes and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped inmystery</s>  but we agreed that the times were changed</s>  and we talked of oldships of seaaccidents of breakdowns dismastings and of a man whobrought his ship safe to liverpool all the way from the river platteunder a jury rudder</s>  we talked of wrecks of short rations and ofheroismor at least of what the newspapers would have called heroismat seaa manifestation of virtues quite different from the heroism ofprimitive times</s>  and now and then falling silent all together we gazedat the sights of the river</s> a p</s>   o</s>  boat passed bound down</s>  one gets jolly good dinners on boardthese ships remarked one of our band</s>  a man with sharp eyes readout the name on her bows arcadia</s>  what a beautiful model of a ship</s> murmured some of us</s>  she was followed by a small cargo steamer and theflag they hauled down aboard while we were looking showed her to be anorwegian</s>  she made an awful lot of smoke and before it had quite blownaway a highsided short wooden barque in ballast and towed by apaddletug appeared in front of the windows</s>  all her hands were forwardbusy setting up the headgear and aft a woman in a red hood quite alonewith the man at the wheel paced the length of the poop back and forthwith the grey wool of some knitting work in her hands</s> german i should think muttered one</s>  the skipper has his wife onboard remarked another and the light of the crimson sunset allablaze behind the london smoke throwing a glow of bengal light upon thebarques spars faded away from the hope reach</s> then one of us who had not spoken before a man of over fifty that hadcommanded ships for a quarter of a century looking after the barque nowgliding far away all black on the lustre of the river saidthis reminds me of an absurd episode in my life now many years agowhen i got first the command of an iron barque loading then in acertain eastern seaport</s>  it was also the capital of an eastern kingdomlying up a river as might be london lies up this old thames of ours</s> no more need be said of the place for this sort of thing might havehappened anywhere where there are ships skippers tugboats and orphannieces of indescribable splendour</s>  and the absurdity of the episodeconcerns only me my enemy falk and my friend hermann</s> there seemed to be something like peculiar emphasis on the words myfriend hermann which caused one of us for we had just been speakingof heroism at sea to say idly and nonchalantlyand was this hermann a hero</s> not at all said our grizzled friend</s>  no hero at all</s>  he was aschifffuhrer shipconductor</s>  thats how they call a master marinerin germany</s>  i prefer our way</s>  the alliteration is good and there issomething in the nomenclature that gives to us as a body the senseof corporate existence apprentice mate master in the ancient andhonourable craft of the sea</s>  as to my friend hermann he might havebeen a consummate master of the honourable craft but he was calledofficially schifffuhrer and had the simple heavy appearance of awelltodo farmer combined with the goodnatured shrewdness of a smallshopkeeper</s>  with his shaven chin round limbs and heavy eyelids he didnot look like a toiler and even less like an adventurer of the sea</s> still he toiled upon the seas in his own way much as a shopkeeperworks behind his counter</s>  and his ship was the means by which hemaintained his growing family</s> she was a heavy strong bluntbowed affair awakening the ideas ofprimitive solidity like the wooden plough of our forefathers</s>  and therewere about her other suggestions of a rustic and homely nature</s>  theextraordinary timber projections which i have seen in no other vesselmade her square stern resemble the tail end of a millers waggon</s>  butthe four stern ports of her cabin glazed with six little greenish paneseach and framed in wooden sashes painted brown might have been thewindows of a cottage in the country</s>  the tiny white curtains and thegreenery of flower pots behind the glass completed the resemblance</s>  onone or two occasions when passing under stern i had detected from myboat a round arm in the act of tilting a watering pot and the bowedsleek head of a maiden whom i shall always call hermanns niece becauseas a matter of fact ive never heard her name for all my intimacy withthe family</s> this however sprang up later on</s>  meantime in common with the restof the shipping in that eastern port i was left in no doubt as tohermanns notions of hygienic clothing</s>  evidently he believed inwearing good stout flannel next his skin</s>  on most days little frocks andpinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship ora tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards but once afortnight the family washing was exhibited in force</s>  it covered thepoop entirely</s>  the afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabbyactivity all that crowded mass of clothing with its vague suggestionsof drowned mutilated and flattened humanity</s>  trunks without heads wavedat you arms without hands legs without feet kicked fantastically withcollapsible flourishes and there were long white garments that takingthe wind fairly through their neck openings edged with lace became fora moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisiblebodies</s>  on these days you could make out that ship at a great distanceby the multicoloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast</s> she had her berth just ahead of me and her name was dianadiana notof ephesus but of bremen</s>  this was proclaimed in white letters a footlong spaced widely across the stern somewhat like the lettering of ashopsign under the cottage windows</s>  this ridiculously unsuitable namestruck one as an impertinence towards the memory of the most charmingof goddesses for apart from the fact that the old craft was physicallyincapable of engaging in any sort of chase there was a gang of fourchildren belonging to her</s>  they peeped over the rail at passing boatsand occasionally dropped various objects into them</s>  thus sometimebefore i knew hermann to speak to i received on my hat a horridragdoll belonging to hermanns eldest daughter</s>  however theseyoungsters were upon the whole well behaved</s>  they had fair heads roundeyes round little knobby noses and they resembled their father a gooddeal</s> this diana of bremen was a most innocent old ship and seemed to knownothing of the wicked sea as there are on shore households that knownothing of the corrupt world</s>  and the sentiments she suggested wereunexceptionable and mainly of a domestic order</s>  she was a home</s>  allthese dear children had learned to walk on her roomy quarterdeck</s>  insuch thoughts there is something pretty even touching</s>  their teeth ishould judge they had cut on the ends of her running gear</s>  i havemany times observed the baby hermann nicholas engaged in gnawing thewhipping of the foreroyal brace</s>  nicholas favourite place of residencewas under the main fiferail</s>  directly he was let loose he wouldcrawl off there and the first seaman who came along would bring himcarefully held aloft in tarry hands back to the cabin door</s>  i fancythere must have been a standing order to that effect</s>  in the course ofthese transportations the baby who was the only peppery person in theship tried to smite these stalwart young german sailors on the face</s> mrs</s>  hermann an engaging stout housewife wore on board baggy bluedresses with white dots</s>  when as happened once or twice i caught her atan elegant little washtub rubbing hard on white collars babys socksand hermanns summer neckties she would blush in girlish confusion andraising her wet hands greet me from afar with many friendly nods</s>  hersleeves would be rolled up to the elbows and the gold hoop of herwedding ring glittered among the soapsuds</s>  her voice was pleasant shehad a serene brow smooth bands of very fair hair and a goodhumouredexpression of the eyes</s>  she was motherly and moderately talkative</s>  whenthis simple matron smiled youthful dimples broke out on her fresh broadcheeks</s>  hermanns niece on the other hand an orphan and very silent inever saw attempt a smile</s>  this however was not gloom on her part butthe restraint of youthful gravity</s>
 hermann as hermann mentionedonce to me</s>  it had been very necessary while they were all little hehad added in a vexed manner</s>  it was her arm and her sleek head thati had glimpsed one morning through the sternwindows of the cabinhovering over the pots of fuchsias and mignonette but the first time ibeheld her full length i surrendered to her proportions</s>  they fix herin my mind as great beauty great intelligence quickness of witor kindness of heart might have made some her other woman equallymemorable</s> with her it was form and size</s>  it was her physical personality that hadthis imposing charm</s>  she might have been witty intelligent and kind toan exceptional degree</s>  i dont know and this is not to the point</s>  alli know is that she was built on a magnificent scale</s>  built is the onlyword</s>  she was constructed she was erected as it were with a regallavishness</s>  it staggered you to see this reckless expenditure ofmaterial upon a chit of a girl</s>  she was youthful and also perfectlymature as though she had been some fortunate immortal</s>  she was heavytoo perhaps but thats nothing</s>  it only added to that notion ofpermanence</s>  she was barely nineteen</s>  but such shoulders</s>  such roundarms</s>  such a shadowing forth of mighty limbs when with three longstrides she pounced across the deck upon the overturned nicholasitsperfectly indescribable</s>  she seemed a good quiet girl vigilant asto lenas needs gustavs tumbles the state of carls dear littlenoseconscientious hardworking and all that</s>  but what magnificenthair she had</s>  abundant long thick of a tawny colour</s>  it had the sheenof precious metals</s>  she wore it plaited tightly into one single tresshanging girlishly down her back and its end reached down to her waist</s> the massiveness of it surprised you</s>  on my word it reminded one of aclub</s>  her face was big comely of an unruffled expression</s>  she had agood complexion and her blue eyes were so pale that she appeared tolook at the world with the empty white candour of a statue</s>  you couldnot call her goodlooking</s>  it was something much more impressive</s> the simplicity of her apparel the opulence of her form her imposingstature and the extraordinary sense of vigorous life that seemed toemanate from her like a perfume exhaled by a flower made her beautifulwith a beauty of a rustic and olympian order</s>  to watch her reaching upto the clothesline with both arms raised high above her head causedyou to fall a musing in a strain of pagan piety</s>  excellent mrs</s> hermanns baggy cotton gowns had some sort of rudimentary frills at neckand bottom but this girls print frocks hadnt even a wrinkle nothingbut a few straight folds in the skirt falling to her feet and thesewhen she stood still had a severe and statuesque quality</s>  she wasinclined naturally to be still whether sitting or standing</s>  however idont mean to say she was statuesque</s>  she was too generously alive butshe could have stood for an allegoric statue of the earth</s>  i dont meanthe wornout earth of our possession but a young earth a virginalplanet undisturbed by the vision of a future teeming with the monstrousforms of life and death clamorous with the cruel battles of hunger andthought</s> the worthy hermann himself was not very entertaining though his englishwas fairly comprehensible</s>  mrs</s>  hermann who always let off one speechat least at me in an hospitable cordial tone and in plattdeutsch isuppose i could not understand</s>  as to their niece however satisfactoryto look upon and she inspired you somehow with a hopeful view as tothe prospects of mankind she was a modest and silent presence mostlyengaged in sewing only now and then as i observed falling over thatwork into a state of maidenly meditation</s>  her aunt sat opposite hersewing also with her feet propped on a wooden footstool</s>  on the otherside of the deck hermann and i would get a couple of chairs out of thecabin and settle down to a smoking match accompanied at long intervalsby the pacific exchange of a few words</s>  i came nearly every evening</s> hermann i would find in his shirt sleeves</s>  as soon as he returned fromthe shore on board his ship he commenced operations by taking off hiscoat then he put on his head an embroidered round cap with a tasseland changed his boots for a pair of cloth slippers</s>  afterwards he smokedat the cabindoor looking at his children with an air of civic virtuetill they got caught one after another and put to bed in variousstaterooms</s>  lastly we would drink some beer in the cabin whichwas furnished with a wooden table on cross legs and with blackstraightbacked chairsmore like a farm kitchen than a ships cuddy</s> the sea and all nautical affairs seemed very far removed from thehospitality of this exemplary family</s> and i liked this because i had a rather worrying time on board my ownship</s>  i had been appointed exofficio by the british consul to takecharge of her after a man who had died suddenly leaving for theguidance of his successor some suspiciously unreceipted bills a fewdrydock estimates hinting at bribery and a quantity of vouchers forthree years extravagant expenditure all these mixed up together in adusty old violincase lined with ruby velvet</s>  i found besides a largeaccountbook which when opened hopefully turned out to my infiniteconsternation to be filled with versespage after page of rhymeddoggerel of a jovial and improper character written in the neatestminute hand i ever did see</s>  in the same fiddlecase a photograph of mypredecessor taken lately in saigon represented in front of a gardenview and in company of a female in strange draperies

the only traceon board was the case its empty husk as it were but of the two lastfreights the ship had indubitably earned of late there were not eventhe husks left</s>  it was impossible to say where all that money had goneto</s>  it wasnt on board</s>  it had not been remitted home for a letterfrom the owners preserved in a desk evidently by the merest accidentcomplained mildly enough that they had not been favoured by a scratchof the pen for the last eighteen months</s>  there were next to no stores onboard not an inch of spare rope or a yard of canvas</s>  the ship had beenrun bare and i foresaw no end of difficulties before i could get herready for sea</s> as i was young thennot thirty yeti took myself and my troubles veryseriously</s>  the old mate who had acted as chief mourner at the captainsfuneral was not particularly pleased at my coming</s>  but the fact is thefellow was not legally qualified for command and the consul was boundif at all possible to put a properly certificated man on board</s>  as tothe second mate all i can say his name was tottersen or something likethat</s>  his practice was to wear on his head in that tropical climate amangy fur cap</s>  he was without exception the stupidest man i had everseen on board ship</s>  and he looked it too</s>  he looked so confoundedlystupid that it was a matter of surprise for me when he answered to hisname</s> i drew no great comfort from their company to say the least of itwhile the prospect of making a long sea passage with those two fellowswas depressing</s>  and my other thoughts in solitude could not be of agay complexion</s>  the crew was sickly the cargo was coming very slow iforesaw i would have lots of trouble with the charterers and doubtedwhether they would advance me enough money for the ships expenses</s> their attitude towards me was unfriendly</s>  altogether i was not gettingon</s>  i would discover at odd times generally about midnight that iwas totally inexperienced greatly ignorant of business and hopelesslyunfit for any sort of command and when the steward had to be taken tothe hospital ill with choleraic symptoms i felt bereaved of the onlydecent person at the after end of the ship</s>  he was fully expected torecover but in the meantime had to be replaced by some sort of servant</s> and on the recommendation of a certain schomberg the proprietor of

those chinamen of the deathshead type of face andcompletely inscrutable</s>  before the end of the third day he had revealedhimself as a confirmed opiumsmoker a gambler a most audacious thiefand a firstclass sprinter</s>  when he departed at the top of his speedwith thirtytwo golden sovereigns of my own hardearned savings it wasthe last straw</s>  i had reserved that money in case my difficulties cameto the worst</s>  now it was gone i felt as poor and naked as a fakir</s>  iclung to my ship for all the bother she caused me but what i could notbear were the long lonely evenings in her cuddy where the atmospheremade smelly by a leaky lamp was agitated by the snoring of the mate</s> that fellow shut himself up in his stuffy cabin punctually at eight andmade gross and revolting noises like a waterlogged trump</s>  it was odiousnot to be able to worry oneself in comfort on board ones own ship</s> everything in this world i reflected even the command of a nice littlebarque may be made a delusion and a snare for the unwary spirit ofpride in man</s> from such reflections i was glad to make any escape on board that bremendiana</s>  there apparently no whisper of the worlds iniquities had everpenetrated</s>  and yet she lived upon the wide sea and the sea tragicand comic the sea with its horrors and its peculiar scandals the seapeopled by men and ruled by iron necessity

the roaring lusts of the sea</s>  and yet i haveknown the sea too long to believe in its respect for decency</s>  anelemental force is ruthlessly frank</s>  it may of course have beenhermanns skilful seamanship but to me it looked as if the alliedoceans had refrained from smashing these high bulwarks unshippingthe lumpy rudder frightening the children and generally opening thisfamilys eyes out of sheer reticence</s>  it looked like reticence</s>  theruthless disclosure was in the end left for a man to make a man strongand elemental enough and driven to unveil some secrets of the sea by thepower of a simple and elemental desire</s> this however occurred much later and meantime i took sanctuary inthat serene old ship early every evening</s>  the only person on board thatseemed to be in trouble was little lena and in due course i perceivedthat the health of the ragdoll was more than delicate</s>  this object leda sort of in extremis existence in a wooden box placed against

the way these children would work up theircompassion for that bedraggled thing i wouldnt have touched with a pairof tongs</s>
 i was only surprised thatmrs</s>  hermann let lena cherish and hug that bundle of rags to thatextent it was so disreputably and completely unclean</s>  but mrs</s>  hermannwould raise her fine womanly eyes from her needlework to look on withamused sympathy and did not seen to see it somehow that thisobject of affection was a disgrace to the ships purity</s>  purity notcleanliness is the word</s>  it was pushed so far that i seemed to detectin this too a sentimental excess as if dirt had been removed invery love</s>  it is impossible to give you an idea of such a meticulousneatness</s>  it was as if every morning that ship had been arduouslyexplored withwith toothbrushes</s>  her very bowsprit three times a weekhad its toilette made with a cake of soap and a piece of soft flannel</s> arrayedi must say arrayedarrayed artlessly in dazzling white paintas to wood and dark green as to ironwork the simpleminded distributionof these colours evoked the images of simpleminded peace of arcadianfelicity and the childish comedy of disease and sorrow struck mesometimes as an abominably real blot upon that ideal state</s> i enjoyed it greatly and on my part i brought a little mild excitementinto it</s>  our intimacy arose from the pursuit of that thief</s>  it was inthe evening and hermann who contrary to his habits had stayed onshore late that day was extricating himself backwards out of a littlegharry on the river bank opposite his ship when the hunt passed</s> realising the situation as though he had eyes in his shoulderblades hejoined us with a leap and took the lead</s>  the chinaman fled silent likea rapid shadow on the dust of an extremely oriental road</s>  i followed</s>  along way in the rear my mate whooped like a savage</s>  a young moon threwa bashful light on a plain like a monstrous waste ground thearchitectural mass of a buddhist temple far away projected itselfin dead black on the sky</s>  we lost the thief of course but in mydisappointment i had to admire hermanns presence of mind</s>  the velocitythat stodgy man developed in the interests of a complete stranger earnedmy warm gratitudethere was something truly cordial in his exertions</s> he seemed as vexed as myself at our failure and would hardly listen tomy thanks</s>  he said it was nothings and invited me on the spot tocome on board his ship and drink a glass of beer with him</s>  we pokedsceptically for a while amongst the bushes peered without convictioninto a ditch or two</s>  there was not a sound patches of slime glimmeredfeebly amongst the reeds</s>  slowly we trudged back drooping under thethin sickle of the moon and i heard him mutter to himself himmel</s>
 he was impressed by the figure of my loss</s>  fora long time we had ceased to hear the mates whoops and yells</s> then he said to me everybody has his troubles and as we went onremarked that he

afterwards i daresay i did tell them some of myadventuressuch as they wereand they marvelled greatly at the extentof my experience</s>  hermann would translate what he thought the moststriking passages</s>  getting up on his legs and as if delivering alecture on a phenomenon he addressed himself with gestures to the twowomen who would let their sewing sink slowly on their laps</s>  meantimei sat before a glass of hermanns beer trying to look modest</s>  mrs</s> hermann would glance at me quickly emit slight achs</s>  the girl nevermade a sound</s>  never</s>  but she too would

scrutinising inspection of thestars</s>  you were drowned in it and imagined yourself to appear blurred</s> and yet this same glance when turned upon christian falk must have beenas efficient as the searchlight of a battleship</s> falk was the other assiduous visitor on board but from his behaviourhe might have been coming to see the quarterdeck capstan</s>  he certainlyused to stare at it a good deal when keeping us company outside thecabin door with one muscular arm thrown over the back of the chair andhis big shapely legs in very tight white trousers extended far out andending in a pair of black shoes as roomy as punts</s>  on arrival he wouldshake hermanns hand with a mutter bow to the women and take up hiscareless and misanthropic attitude by our side</s>  he departed abruptlywith a jump going through the performance of grunts handshakes bowas if in a panic</s>  sometimes with a sort of discreet and convulsiveeffort he approached the women and exchanged a few low words with themhalf a dozen at most</s>  on these occasions hermanns usual stare becamepositively glassy and mrs</s>  hermanns kind countenance would colour up</s> the girl herself never turned a hair</s> falk was a dane or perhaps a norwegian i cant tell now</s>  at all eventshe was a scandinavian of some sort and a bloated monopolist to boot</s> it is possible he was unacquainted with the word but he had a clearperception of the thing itself</s>  his tariff of charges for towing shipsin and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort ihad ever seen</s>  he was the commander and owner of the only tugboat onthe river a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more as elegantlyneat as a yacht with a round wheelhouse rising like a glazed turrethigh above her sharp bows and with one slender varnished pole mastforward</s>  i daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who rememberfalk and his tug very well</s>  he extracted his pound and a half offlesh from each of us

 but my advice is gentlemendont you have anything to do with him if you can help it</s> this advice apart from unavoidable business relations was easy tofollow because falk intruded upon no one</s>  it seems absurd to compare atugboat skipper to a centaur but he reminded me somehow of an engravingin a little book i had as a boy which represented centaurs at a streamand there was one especially in the foreground prancing bow and arrowsin hand with regular severe features and an immense curled wavy beardflowing down his breast</s>  falks face reminded me of that centaur</s> besides he was a composite creature</s>  not a manhorse it is true buta manboat</s>  he lived on board his tug which was always dashing up anddown the river from early morn till dewy eve</s>
in the last rays of the setting sun you could pick out far away downthe reach his beard borne high up on the white structure foaming upstream to anchor for the night</s>  there was the whiteclad mans body andthe rich brown patch of the hair and nothing below the waist but thethwartship white lines of the bridgescreens that lead the eye to thesharp white lines of the bows cleaving the muddy water of the river</s>
separated from his boat to me at least he seemed incomplete</s>  the tugherself without his head and torso on the bridge looked mutilated as itwere</s>  but he left her very seldom</s>  all the time i remained in harbouri saw him only twice on shore</s>  on the first occasion it was at mycharterers where he came in misanthropically to get paid for towing outa french barque the day before</s>  the second time i could hardly believemy eyes for i beheld him reclining under his beard in a canebottomedchair in the billiardroom of schombergs hotel</s> it was very funny to see schomberg ignoring him pointedly</s>  theartificiality of it contrasted strongly with falks natural unconcern</s> the big alsatian talked loudly with his other customers going from onelittle table to the other and passing

being made towonder at such a movement breaking some long period of stillness</s>  it wasa passionate and inexplicable gesture</s>  he used to make it at all sortsof times as likely as not after he had been listening to little lenaschatter about the suffering doll for instance</s>  the hermann childrenalways besieged him about his legs closely though in a gentle way heshrank from them a little</s>  he seemed however to feel a great affectionfor the whole family</s>  for hermann himself especially</s>  he sought hiscompany</s>  in this case for instance he must have been waiting for himbecause as soon as he appeared falk rose hastily and they went outtogether</s>  then schomberg expounded in my hearing to three or four peoplehis theory that falk was after captain hermanns niece and assertedconfidently that nothing would come of it</s>  it was the same last yearwhen captain hermann was loading here he said</s> naturally i did not believe schomberg but i own that for a time iobserved closely what went on</s>  all i discovered was some impatience onhermanns part</s>  at the sight of falk stepping over the gangway theexcellent man would begin to mumble and chew between his teeth somethingthat sounded like german swearwords</s>  however as ive said im notfamiliar with the language and hermanns soft roundeyed countenanceremained unchanged</s>  staring stolidly ahead he greeted him with wiegehts or in english how are you</s>  with a throaty enunciation</s>  thegirl would look up for an instant and move her lips slightly mrs</s> hermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk volubly to him for aminute or so in her pleasant voice before she went on with her sewingagain</s>  falk would throw himself into a chair stretch his big legs aslike as not draw his hands down his face passionately</s>  as to myself hewas not pointedly impertinent it was rather as though he could not bebothered with such trifles as my existence and the truth is that beinga monopolist he was under no necessity to be amiable</s>  he was sure to gethis own extortionate terms out of me for towage whether he frownedor smiled</s>  as a matter of fact he did neither but before many dayselapsed he managed to astonish me not a little and to set schombergstongue clacking more than ever</s> it came about in this way</s>  there was a shallow bar at the mouth of theriver which ought to have been kept down but the authorities of thestate were piously busy gilding afresh the great buddhist pagoda justthen and i suppose had no money to spare for dredging operations</s>  idont know how it may be now but at the time i speak of that sandbankwas a great nuisance to the shipping</s>  one of its consequences was thatvessels of a certain draught of water like hermanns or mine could notcomplete their loading in the river</s>  after taking in as much as possibleof their cargo they had to go outside to fill up</s>  the whole procedurewas an unmitigated bore</s>  when you thought you had as much on board asyour ship could carry safely over the bar you went and gave notice toyour agents</s>  they in their turn notified falk that soandso was readyto go out</s>  then falk ostensibly when it fitted in with his other workbut if the truth were known simply when his arbitrary spirit movedhim after ascertaining carefully in the office that there was enoughmoney to meet his bill would come along unsympathetically glaringat you with his yellow eyes from the bridge and would drag you outdishevelled as to rigging lumbered as to the decks with unfeelinghaste as if to execution</s>  and he

werealarmed by finding themselves floating amongst detached pieces of ice</s> but the fear of sinking passed away like their vigour like their hopesthe shocks of the floes knocking against the ships

memory</s>  next day thedoors of the chartroom were swinging open to the roll of the ship andthe captain had disappeared</s>  he must during the night have jumped intothe sea</s>  falk locked both the doors and kept the keys</s> the organised life of the ship had come to an end</s>  the solidarity ofthe men had gone</s>  they became indifferent to each other</s>  it was falkwho took in hand the

was ready to put his hand on him the man let go hishold and sank like a stone</s>  falk reflected on these sights</s>  his heartrevolted against the horror of death and he said to himself that hewould

carpenterremained on deck together</s>  falk liked the big carpenter</s>  he had been thebest man of the lot helpful and ready as long as there was anything todo the longest hopeful and had preserved to the last some vigour anddecision of mind</s> they did not speak to each other</s>  henceforth no voices were to be heardconversing sadly on board that ship</s>  after a time the carpenter totteredaway forward but later on falk going to drink at the freshwater pumphad the inspiration to turn his head</s>  the carpenter had stolen upon himfrom behind and summoning all his strength was aiming with a crowbara blow at the back of his skull</s> dodging just in time falk made his escape and ran into his cabin</s>  whilehe was loading his revolver there he heard the sound of heavy blowsstruck upon the bridge</s>  the locks of the chartroom doors were slightthey flew open and the carpenter possessing himself of the captainsrevolver fired a shot of defiance</s> falk was about to go on deck and have it out at once when he remarkedthat one of the ports of his cabin commanded the approaches to thefreshwater pump</s>  instead of going out he remained in and secured thedoor</s>  the best man shall survive he said to himselfand the otherhe reasoned must at some time or other come there to drink</s>  thesestarving men would drink often to cheat the pangs of their hunger</s>  butthe carpenter too must have noticed the position of the port</s>  they werethe two best men in the ship and the game was with them</s>  all the restof the day falk saw no one and heard no sound</s>  at night he strained hiseyes</s>  it was darkhe heard a rustling noise once but he was certainthat no one could have come near the pump</s>  it was to the left of hisdeck port and he could not have

and had not given way to the horror of the situation</s>  hewanted to live</s> but during the night the carpenter without at all trying to approachthe pump had managed to creep quietly along the starboard bulwark andunseen had crouched down right under falks deck port</s>  when daylightcame he rose up suddenly looked in and putting his arm through theround brass framed opening fired at falk within a foot</s>  he missedandfalk instead of attempting to seize the arm holding the weapon openedhis door unexpectedly and with the muzzle of his long revolver nearlytouching the others side shot

out into the cold cruel dawn of antarcticregions from various hidingplaces over the deck of that dismantledcorpse of a ship floating on a grey sea ruled by iron necessity and witha heart of icethere
