was very busy but she would not let him</s>  so hebeganwell once there was a little pigshe put her hand over his mouth and stopped him at the word</s>  she saidshe had heard little pigstories till she was perfectly sick of them</s> well what kind of story shall i tell then</s> about christmas</s>  its getting to be the season</s>  its past thanksgivingalready</s> it seems to me her papa argued that ive told as often aboutchristmas as i have about little pigs</s> no difference</s>  christmas is more interesting</s> well</s>  her papa roused himself from his writing by a great effort</s> well then ill tell you about the little girl that wanted itchristmas every day in the year</s>  how would you like that</s> firstrate</s>  said the little girl and she nestled into comfortableshape in his lap ready for listening</s> very well then this little pigoh what are you pounding me for</s> because you said little pig instead of little girl</s> i should like to know whats the difference between a little pig and alittle girl that wanted it christmas every day</s> papa said the little girl warningly if you dont go on illgive it to you</s>  and at this her papa darted off like lightning andbegan to tell the story as fast as he could</s>  well once there was a little girl who liked christmas so much that she wanted it to be christmas every day in the year and as soon as thanksgiving was over she began to send postalcards to the old christmas fairy to ask if she mightnt have it</s>  but the old fairy never answered any of the postals and after a while the little girl found out that the fairy was pretty particular and wouldnt notice anything but lettersnot even correspondence cards in envelopes but real letters on sheets of paper and sealed outside with a monogramor your initial anyway</s>  so then she began to send her letters and in about three weeksor just the day before christmas it wasshe got a letter from the fairy saying she might have it christmas every day for a year and then they would see about having it longer</s>  the little girl was a good deal excited already preparing for the oldfashioned onceayear christmas that was coming the next day and perhaps the fairys promise didnt make such an impression on her as it would have made at some other time</s>  she just resolved to keep it to herself and surprise everybody with it as it kept coming true and then it slipped out of her mind altogether</s>  she had a splendid christmas</s>  she went to bed early so as to let santa claus have a chance at the stockings and in the morning she was up the first of anybody and went and felt them and found hers all lumpy with packages of candy and oranges and grapes and pocketbooks and rubber balls and all kinds of small presents and her big brothers with nothing but the tongs in them and her young lady sisters with a new silk umbrella and her papas and mammas with potatoes and pieces of coal wrapped up in tissuepaper just as they always had every christmas</s>  then she waited around till the rest of the family were up and she was the first to burst into the library when the doors were opened and look at the large presents laid out on the librarytablebooks and portfolios and boxes of stationery and breastpins and dolls and little stoves and dozens of handkerchiefs and inkstands and skates and snowshovels and photographframes and little easels and boxes of watercolors and turkish paste and nougat and candied cherries and dolls houses and waterproofsand the big christmastree lighted and standing in a wastebasket in the middle</s>  she had a splendid christmas all day</s>  she ate so much candy that she did not want any breakfast and the whole forenoon the presents kept pouring in that the expressman had not had time to deliver the night before and she went round giving the presents she had got for other people and came home and ate turkey and cranberry for dinner and plumpudding and nuts and raisins and oranges and more candy and then went out and coasted and came in with a stomachache crying and her papa said he would see if his house was turned into that sort of fools paradise another year and they had a light supper and pretty early everybody went to bed cross</s> here the little girl pounded her papa in the back again</s> well what now</s>  did i say pigs</s> you made them act like pigs</s> well didnt they</s> no matter you oughtnt to put it into a story</s> very well then ill take it all out</s> her father went on the little girl slept very heavily and she slept very late but she was wakened at last by the other children dancing round her bed with their stockings full of presents in their hands</s>  what is it</s>  said the little girl and she rubbed her eyes and tried to rise up in bed</s>  christmas</s>  christmas</s>  christmas</s>  they all shouted and waved their stockings</s>  nonsense</s>  it was christmas yesterday</s>  her brothers and sisters just laughed</s>  we dont know about that</s>  its christmas today anyway</s>  you come into the library and see</s>  then all at once it flashed on the little girl that the fairy was keeping her promise and her year of christmases was beginning</s>  she was dreadfully sleepy but she sprang up like a larka lark that had overeaten itself and gone to bed crossand darted into the library</s>  there it was again</s>  books and portfolios and boxes of stationery and breastpinsyou neednt go over it all papa i guess i can remember just what wasthere said the little girl</s>  well and there was the christmastree blazing away and the family picking out their presents but looking pretty sleepy and her father perfectly puzzled and her mother ready to cry</s>  im sure i dont see how im to dispose of all these things said her mother and her father said it seemed to him they had had something just like it the day before but he supposed he must have dreamed it</s>  this struck the little girl as the best kind of a joke and so she ate so much candy she didnt want any breakfast and went round carrying presents and had turkey and cranberry for dinner and then went out and coasted and came in with apapa</s> well what now</s> what did you promise you forgetful thing</s> oh</s>
 well the next day it was just the same thing over again but everybody getting crosser and at the end of a weeks time so many people had lost their tempers that you could pick up lost tempers anywhere they perfectly strewed the ground</s>  even when people tried to recover their tempers they usually got somebody elses and it made the most dreadful mix</s>  the little girl began to get frightened keeping the secret all to herself she wanted to tell her mother but she didnt dare to and she was ashamed to ask the fairy to take back her gift it seemed ungrateful and illbred and she thought she would try to stand it but she hardly knew how she could for a whole year</s>  so it went on and on and it was christmas on st</s>  valentines day and washingtons birthday just the same as any day and it didnt skip even the first of april though everything was counterfeit that day and that was some little relief</s>  after a while coal and potatoes began to be awfully scarce so many had been wrapped up in tissuepaper to fool papas and mammas with</s>  turkeys got to be about a thousand dollars apiecepapa</s> well what</s> youre beginning to fib</s> well two thousand then</s>  and they got to passing off almost anything for turkeyshalfgrown hummingbirds and even rocs out of the arabian nightsthe real turkeys were so scarce</s>  and cranberrieswell they asked a diamond apiece for cranberries</s>  all the woods and orchards were cut down for christmastrees and where the woods and orchards used to be it looked just like a stubblefield with the stumps</s>  after a while they had to make christmastrees out of rags and stuff them with bran like oldfashioned dolls but there were plenty of rags because people got so poor buying presents for one another that they couldnt get any new clothes and they just wore their old ones to tatters</s>  they got so poor that everybody had to go to the poorhouse except the confectioners and the fancystore keepers and the picturebook sellers and the expressmen and they all got so rich and proud that they would hardly wait upon a person when he came to buy</s>  it was perfectly shameful</s>  well after it had gone on about three or four months the little girl whenever she came into the room in the morning and saw those great ugly lumpy stockings dangling at the fireplace and the disgusting presents around everywhere used to just sit down and burst out crying</s>  in six months she was perfectly exhausted she couldnt even cry any more she just lay on the lounge and rolled her eyes and panted</s>  about the beginning of october she took to sitting down on dolls wherever she found themfrench dolls or any kindshe hated the sight of them so and by thanksgiving she was crazy and just slammed her presents across the room</s>  by that time people didnt carry presents around nicely any more</s>  they flung them over the fence or through the window or anything and instead of running their tongues out and taking great pains to write for dear papa or mamma or brother or sister or susie or sammie or billie or bobbie or jimmie or jennie or whoever it was and troubling to get the spelling right and then signing their names and xmas 18 they used to write in the giftbooks take it you horrid old thing</s>  and then go and bang it against the front door</s>  nearly everybody had built barns to hold their presents but pretty soon the barns overflowed and then they used to let them lie out in the rain or anywhere</s>  sometimes the police used to come and tell them to shovel their presents off the sidewalk or they would arrest them</s> i thought you said everybody had gone to the poorhouse interruptedthe little girl</s> they did go at first said her papa but after a while thepoorhouses got so full that they had to send the people back to theirown houses</s>  they tried to cry when they got back but they couldntmake the least sound</s> why couldnt they</s> because they had lost their voices saying merry christmas so much</s> did i tell you how it was on the fourth of july</s> no how was it</s>  and the little girl nestled closer in expectation ofsomething uncommon</s>  well the night before the boys stayed up to celebrate as they always do and fell asleep before twelve oclock as usual expecting to be wakened by the bells and cannon</s>  but it was nearly eight oclock before the first boy in the united states woke up and then he found out what the trouble was</s>  as soon as he could get his clothes on he ran out of the house and smashed a big cannontorpedo down on the pavement but it didnt make any more noise than a damp wad of paper and after he tried about twenty or thirty more he began to pick them up and look at them</s>  every single torpedo was a big raisin</s>  then he just streaked it upstairs and examined his firecrackers and toypistol and twodollar collection of fireworks and found that they were nothing but sugar and candy painted up to look like fireworks</s>  before ten oclock every boy in the united states found out that his fourth of july things had turned into christmas things and then they just sat down and criedthey were so mad</s>  there are about twenty million boys in the united states and so you can imagine what a noise they made</s>  some men got together before night with a little powder that hadnt turned into purple sugar yet and they said they would fire off one cannon anyway</s>  but the cannon burst into a thousand pieces for it was nothing but rockcandy and some of the men nearly got killed</s>  the fourth of july orations all turned into christmas carols and when anybody tried to read the declaration instead of saying when in the course of human events it becomes necessary he was sure to sing god rest you merry gentlemen</s>  it was perfectly awful</s> the little girl drew a deep sigh of satisfaction</s>
and how was it at thanksgiving</s> her papa hesitated</s>  well im almost afraid to tell you</s>  im afraidyoull think its wicked</s>
well tell anyway said the little girl</s>  well before it came thanksgiving it had leaked out who had caused all these christmases</s>  the little girl had suffered so much that she had talked about it in her sleep and after that hardly anybody would play with her</s>  people just perfectly despised her because if it had not been for her greediness it wouldnt have happened and now when it came thanksgiving and she wanted them to go to church and have squashpie and turkey and show their gratitude they said that all the turkeys had been eaten up for her old christmas dinners and if she would stop the christmases they would see about the gratitude</s>  wasnt it dreadful</s>  and the very next day the little girl began to send letters to the christmas fairy and then telegrams to stop it</s>  but it didnt do any good and then she got to calling at the fairys house but the girl that came to the door always said not at home or engaged or at dinner or something like that and so it went on till it came to the old onceayear christmas eve</s>  the little girl fell asleep and when she woke up in the morningshe found it was all nothing but a dream suggested the little girl</s> no indeed</s>  said her papa</s>  it was all every bit true</s> well what did she find out then</s> why that it wasnt christmas at last and wasnt ever going to be anymore</s>  now its time for breakfast</s> the little girl held her papa fast around the neck</s> you shant go if youre going to leave it so</s> how do you want it left</s>
all right said her papa and he went on again</s>  well there was the greatest rejoicing all over the country and it extended clear up into canada</s>  the people met together everywhere and kissed and cried for joy</s>  the city carts went around and gathered up all the candy and raisins and nuts and dumped them into the river and it made the fish perfectly sick and the whole united states as far out as alaska was one blaze of bonfires where the children were burning up their giftbooks and presents of all kinds</s>  they had the greatest time</s>
 the little girl went to thank the old fairy because she had stopped its being christmas and she said she hoped she would keep her promise and see that christmas never never came again</s>  then the fairy frowned and asked her if she was sure she knew what she meant and the little girl asked her why not</s>  and the old fairy said that now she was behaving just as greedily as ever and shed better look out</s>  this made the little girl think it all over carefully again and she said she would be willing to have it christmas about once in a thousand years and then she said a hundred and then she said ten and at last she got down to one</s>  then the fairy said that was the good old way that had pleased people ever since christmas began and she was agreed</s>  then the little girl said whatre your shoes made of</s>  and the fairy said leather</s>  and the little girl said bargains done forever and skipped off and hippityhopped the whole way home she was so glad</s> how will that do</s>  asked the papa</s> firstrate</s>  said the little girl but she hated to have the storystop and was rather sober</s>  however her mamma put her head in at thedoor and asked her papaare you never coming to breakfast</s>  what have you been telling thatchild</s> oh just a moral tale</s> the little girl caught him around the neck again</s> we know</s>  dont you tell what papa</s>  dont you tell what</s> turkeys turning the tables</s> well you see the papa began on christmas morning when the littlegirl had snuggled in his lap into just the right shape for listeningit was the night after thanksgiving and you know how everybody feelsthe night after thanksgiving</s> yes but you neednt begin that way papa said the little girl imnot going to have any moral to it this time</s> no indeed</s>  but it can be a true story cant it</s> i dont know said the little girl i like madeup ones</s> well this is going to be a true one anyway and its no usetalking</s>  all the relations in the neighborhood had come to dinner and then gone back to their own houses but some of the relations had come from a distance and these had to stay all night at the grandfathers</s>  but whether they went or whether they stayed they all told the grandmother that they did believe it was the best thanksgiving dinner they had ever eaten in their born days</s>  they had had cranberry sauce and theyd had mashed potato and theyd had mincepie and pandowdy and theyd had celery and theyd had hubbard squash and theyd had tea and coffee both and theyd had appledumpling with hard sauce and theyd had hot biscuit and sweet pickle and mangoes and frosted cake and nuts and cauliflowerdont mix them all up so</s>  pleaded the little girl</s>  its perfectlyconfusing</s>  i cant hardly tell what they had now</s> well they mixed them up just in the same way and i suppose thatsone of the reasons why it happened</s>  whenever a child wanted to go back from dumpling and frosted cake to mashed potato and hubbard squashthey were oldfashioned kind of people and they had everything on the table at once because the grandmother and the aunties cooked it and they couldnt keep jumping up all the time to change the platesand its mother said it shouldnt its grandmother said indeed it should then and helped it herself and the childs father would say well he guessed he would go back too for a change and the childs mother would say she should think he would be ashamed and then they would get to going back till everything was perfectly higgledypiggledy</s> oh shouldnt you like to have been there papa</s>  sighed the littlegirl</s> you mustnt interrupt</s>  where was i</s> higgledypiggledy</s> oh yes</s>  well but the greatest thing of all was the turkey that they had</s>  it was a gobbler i tell you that was nearly as big as a giraffe</s> papa</s>  it took the premium at the county fair and when it was dressed it weighed fifteen poundswell maybe twentyand it was so heavy that the grandmothers and the aunties couldnt put it on the table and they had to get one of the papas to do it</s>  you ought to have heard the hurrahing when the children saw him coming in from the kitchen with it</s>  it seemed as if they couldnt hardly talk of anything but that turkey the whole dinnertime</s>  the grandfather hated to carve and so one of the papas did it and whenever he gave anybody a piece the grandfather would tell some new story about the turkey till pretty soon the aunties got to saying now father stop</s>  and one of them said it made it seem as if the gobbler was walking about on the table to hear so much about him and it took her appetite all away and that made the papas begin to ask the grandfather more and more about the turkey</s> yes said the little girl thoughtfully i know what papas are</s> yes theyre pretty much all alike</s>  and the mammas began to say they acted like a lot of silly boys and what would the children think</s>  but nothing could stop it and all through the afternoon and evening whenever the papas saw any of the aunties or mammas round they would begin to ask the grandfather more particulars about the turkey</s>  the grandfather was pretty forgetful and he told the same things right over</s>  well and so it went on till it came bedtime and then the mammas and aunties began to laugh and whisper together and to say they did believe they should dream about that turkey and when the papas kissed the grandmother goodnight they said well they must have his mate for christmas and then they put their arms round the mammas and went out hawhawing</s> i dont think they behaved very dignified said the little girl</s> well you see they were just funning and had got going and it wasthanksgiving anyway</s>  well in about half an hour everybody was fast asleep and dreamingis it going to be a dream</s>  asked the little girl with somereluctance</s> didnt i say it was going to be a true story</s> yes</s> how can it be a dream then</s> you said everybody was fast asleep and dreaming</s> well but i hadnt got through</s>  everybody except one little girl</s> now papa</s> what</s> dont you go and say her name was the same as mine and her eyes thesame color</s> what an idea</s>  this was a very good little girl and very respectful to her papa and didnt suspect him of tricks but just believed everything he said</s>  and she was a very pretty little girl and had red eyes and blue cheeks and straight hair and a curly nosenow papa if you get to cutting upwell i wont then</s>  well she was rather a delicate little girl and whenever she overate or anythinghave bad dreams</s>  aha</s>  i told you it was going to be a dream</s> you wait till i get through</s>  she was apt to lie awake thinking and some of her thinks were pretty dismal</s>  well that night instead of thinking and tossing and turning and counting a thousand it seemed to this other little girl that she began to see things as soon as she had got warm in bed and before even</s>  and the first thing she saw was a large bronzecoloredturkey gobbler</s> no maam</s>  turkey gobblers ghost</s> foo</s>  said the little girl rather uneasily whoever heard of aturkeys ghost i should like to know</s> never mind that said the papa</s>  if it hadnt been a ghost could themoonlight have shone through it</s>  no indeed</s>  the stuffing wouldnt havelet it</s>  so you see it must have been a ghost</s>
 it had a red pasteboard placard round its neck with first premium printed on it and so she knew that it was the ghost of the very turkey they had had for dinner</s>  it was perfectly awful when it put up its tail and dropped its wings and strutted just the way the grandfather said it used to do</s>  it seemed to be in a wide pasture like that back of the house and the children had to cross it to get home and they were all afraid of the turkey that kept gobbling at them and threatening them because they had eaten him up</s>  at last one of the boysit was the other little girls brothersaid he would run across and get his papa to come out and help them and the first thing she knew the turkey was after him gaining gaining gaining and all the grass was full of henturkeys and turkey chicks running after him and gaining gaining gaining and just as he was getting to the wall he tripped and fell over a turkeypen and all at once she was in one of the aunties room and the aunty was in bed and the turkeys were walking up and down over her and stretching out their wings and blaming her</s>  two of them carried a platter of chicken pie and there was a large pumpkin jackolantern hanging to the bedpost to light the room and it looked just like the other little girls brother in the face only perfectly ridiculous</s> illustration the old gobbler first premium said they were going toturn the tables now</s>  then the old gobbler first premium clapped his wings and said come on chickchickledren</s>
 the old gobbler first premium said they were going to turn the tables now and she knew what he meant for they had had that in the reader at school just before vacation and the teacher had explained it</s>  he made a long speech with his hat on and kept pointing at her with one of his wings while he told the other turkeys that it was her grandfather who had done it and now it was their turn</s>  he said that human beings had been eating turkeys ever since the discovery of america and it was time for the turkeys to begin paying them back if they were ever going to</s>  he said she was pretty young but she was as big as he was and he had no doubt they would enjoy her</s>  the other little girl tried to tell him that she was not to blame and that she only took a very very little piece</s>  but it was right off the breast said the gobbler and he shed tears so that the other little girl cried too</s>  she didnt have much hopes they all seemed so spiteful especially the little turkey chicks but she told them that she was very tenderhearted and never hurt a single thing and she tried to make them understand that there was a great difference between eating people and just eating turkeys</s>  what difference i should like to know</s>  says the old henturkey pretty snappishly</s>  people have got souls and turkeys havent says the other little girl</s>  i dont see how that makes it any better says the old henturkey</s>  it dont make it any better for the turkeys</s>  if we havent got any souls we cant live after weve been eaten up and you can</s>  the other little girl was awfully frightened to have the henturkey take that tack</s> i should think she would a been said the little girl and shecuddled snugger into her papas arms</s>  what could she say</s>  ugh</s>  goon</s>  well she didnt know what to say thats a fact</s>  you see she never thought of it in that light before</s>  all she could say was well people have got reason anyway and turkeys have only got instinct so there</s>  youd better look out says the old henturkey and all the little turkey chicks got so mad they just hopped and the oldest little heturkey that was just beginning to be a gobbler he dropped his wings and spread his tail just like his father and walked round the other little girl till it was perfectly frightful</s> i should think they would a been ashamed</s>  well perhaps old first premium was a little because he stopped them</s>  my dear he says to the old henturkey and chickchickledren you forget yourselves you should have a little consideration</s>  perhaps you wouldnt behave much better yourselves if you were just going to be eaten</s>  and they all began to scream and to cry weve been eaten and were nothing but turkey ghosts</s> there now papa says the little girl sitting up straight so asto argue better i knew it wasnt true all along</s>  how could turkeyshave ghosts if they dont have souls i should like to know</s> oh easily said the papa</s> tell how said the little girl</s> now look here said the papa are you telling this story or am i</s> you are said the little girl and she cuddled down again</s>  go on</s> well then dont you interrupt</s>  where was i</s>  oh yes</s>  well he couldnt do anything with them old first premium couldnt</s>  they acted perfectly ridiculous and one little brat of a spiteful little chick piped out i speak for a drumstick ma</s>  and then they all began i want a wing ma</s>  and im going to have the wishbone</s>  and i shall have just as much stuffing as ever i please shant i ma</s>  till the other little girl was perfectly disgusted with them she thought they oughtnt to say it before her anyway but she had hardly thought this before they all screamed out they used to say it before us and then she didnt know what to say because she knew how people talked before animals</s> i dont believe i ever did said the little girl</s>  go on</s>  well old first premium tried to quiet them again and when he couldnt he apologized to the other little girl so nicely that she began to like him</s>  he said they didnt mean any harm by it they were just excited and chickledren would be chickledren</s>  yes said the other little girl but i think you might take some older person to begin with</s>  its a perfect shame to begin with a little girl</s>  begin</s>  says old first premium</s>  do you think were just beginning</s>  why when do you think it is</s>  the night after thanksgiving</s>
 1886</s>  they all gave a perfect screech</s>  why its christmas eve 1900 and every one of your friends has been eaten up long ago says old first premium and he began to cry over her and the old henturkey and the little turkey chicks began to wipe their eyes on the backs of their wings</s> i dont think they were very neat said the little girl</s> well they were kindhearted anyway and they felt sorry for the otherlittle girl</s>  and she began to think she had made some little impressionon them when she noticed the old henturkey beginning to untie herbonnet strings and the turkey chicks began to spread round her in acircle with the points of their wings touching so that she couldntget out and they commenced dancing and singing and after a while thatlittle heturkey says whos it</s>  and the other little girl shedidnt know why says im it and old first premium says do youpromise</s>  and the other little girl says yes i promise and she knewshe was promising if they would let her go that people should nevereat turkeys any more</s>  and the moon began to shine brighter and brighterthrough the turkeys and pretty soon it was the sun and then it was notthe turkeys but the

says the papa</s> by going on with the story says the little girl and she cuddled downagain</s> oh well thats easy enough</s>  as soon as it was light in the room the other little girl could see that the place was full of people crammed and jammed and they were all awfully excited and kept yelling down with the traitress</s>  away with the renegade</s>  shame on the little sneak</s>  till it was worse than the turkeys ten times</s>  she knew that they meant her and she tried to explain that she just had to promise and that if they had been in her place they would have promised too and of course they could do as they pleased about keeping her word but she was going to keep it anyway and never never never eat another piece of turkey either at thanksgiving or at christmas</s>  very well

pacific express</s> christmas eve after the children had hung up their stockings and gotall ready for st</s>  nic they climbed up on the papas lap to kiss himgoodnight and when they both got their arms round his neck they saidthey were not going to bed till he told them a christmas story</s>  then hesaw that he would have to mind for they were awfully severe with himand always made him do exactly what they told him it was the way theyhad brought him up</s>  he tried his best to get out of it for a while butafter they had shaken him first this side and then that side andpulled him backward and forward till he did not know where he was hebegan to think perhaps he had better begin</s>  the first thing he saidafter he opened his eyes and made believe he had been asleep orsomething was well what did i leave off at</s>  and that made them justperfectly boiling for they understood his tricks and they knew he wastrying to pretend that he had told part of the story already and theysaid he had not left off anywhere because he had not commenced and hesaw it was no use</s>  so he commenced</s> once there was a little pony engine that used to play round thefitchburg depot on the side tracks and sleep in among the biglocomotives in the carhousethe little girl lifted her head from the papas shoulder where she haddropped it</s>  is it a sad story papa</s> how is it going to end</s>  asked the boy</s> well its got a moral said the papa</s> oh all right if its got a moral said the children they had a gooddeal of fun with the morals the papa put to his stories</s>  the boy addedgo on and the little girl prompted carhouse</s> the papa said now every time you stop me i shall have to begin allover again</s>  but he saw that this was not going to spite them any so hewent on one of the locomotives was its mother and she had got hurtonce in a big smashup so that she couldnt run long trips any more</s> she was so weak in the chest you could hear her wheeze as far as youcould see her</s>  but she could work round the depot and pull empty carsin and out and shunt them off on the side tracks and she was soanxious to be useful that all the other engines respected her and theywere very kind to the little pony engine on her account though it wasalways getting in the way and under their wheels and everything</s>  theyall knew it was an orphan for before its mother got hurt its fatherwent through a bridge one dark night into an arm of the sea and wasnever heard of again he was supposed to have been drowned</s>  the oldmother locomotive used to say that it would never have happened if shehad been there but poor dear no</s>  236 was always so venturesome and shehad warned him against that very bridge time and again</s>  then she wouldwhistle so dolefully and sigh with her airbrakes enough to makeanybody cry</s>  you see they used to be a very happy family when they wereall together before the papa locomotive got drowned</s>  he was very fondof the little pony engine and told it stories at night after they gotinto the carhouse at the end of some of his long runs</s>  it would get upon his cowcatcher and lean its chimney up against his and listen tillit fell asleep</s>  then he would put it softly down and be off again inthe morning before it was awake</s>  i tell you those were happy days forpoor no</s>  236</s>  the little pony engine could just remember him it wasawfully proud of its papa</s> the boy lifted his head and looked at the little girl who suddenly hidher face in the papas other shoulder</s>  well i declare papa she wasputting up her lip</s> i wasnt any such thing</s>  said the little girl</s>  and i dont care</s> so</s>  and then she sobbed</s> now never you mind said the papa to the boy</s>
 well and then she used to caution thelittle pony engine against getting in the way of the big locomotivesand told it to keep close round after her and try to do all it could tolearn about shifting empty cars</s>  you see she knew how ambitious thelittle pony engine was and how it wasnt contented a bit just to growup in the ponyengine business and be tied down to the depot all itsdays</s>  once she happened to tell it that if it was good and always didwhat it was bid perhaps a cowcatcher would grow on it some day andthen it could be a passenger locomotive</s>  mammas have to promise allsorts of things and she was almost distracted when she said that</s> i dont think she ought to have deceived it papa said the boy</s>  butit ought to have known that if it was a pony engine to begin with itnever could have a cowcatcher</s> couldnt it</s>  asked the little girl gently</s> no theyre kind of mooley</s> the little girl asked the papa what makes pony engines mooley</s>  forshe did not choose to be told by her brother he was only two yearsolder than she was anyway</s> well its pretty hard to say</s>  you see when a locomotive is firsthatchedoh are they hatched papa</s>  asked the boy</s> well well call it hatched said the papa but they knew he wasjust funning</s>  theyre about the size of teakettles at first and itsa chance whether they will have cowcatchers or not</s>  if they keep theirspouts they will and if their spouts drop off they wont</s> what makes the spout ever drop off</s> oh sometimes the pip or the gapesthe children both began to shake the papa and he was glad enough to goon sensibly</s>  well anyway the mother locomotive certainly oughtnt tohave deceived it</s>  still she had to say something and perhaps thelittle pony engine was better employed watching its buffers with itsheadlight to see whether its cowcatcher had begun to grow than itwould have been in listening to the stories of the old locomotives andsometimes their swearing</s> do they swear papa</s>  asked the little girl somewhat shocked and yetpleased</s> well i never heard them near by</s>  but it sounds a good deal likeswearing when you hear them on the upgrade on our hill in the night</s> where was i</s> swearing said the boy</s>  and please dont go back now papa</s> well i wont</s>  itll be as much as i can do to get through this storywithout going over any of it again</s>  well the thing that the little ponyengine wanted to be the most in this world was the locomotive of thepacific express that starts out every afternoon at three you know</s>  itintended to apply for the place as soon as its cowcatcher was grownand it was always trying to attract the locomotives attention backingand filling on the track alongside of the train and once it raced it alittle piece and beat it before the express locomotive was under wayand almost got in front of it on a switch</s>  my but its mother wasscared</s>  she just yelled to it with her whistle and that night she sentit to sleep without a particle of coal or water in its tender</s> but the little pony engine didnt care</s>  it had beaten the pacificexpress in a hundred yards and what was to hinder it from beating it aslong as it chose</s>  the little pony engine could not get it out of itshead</s>  it was just like a boy who thinks he can whip a man</s> the boy lifted his head</s>  well a boy can papa if he goes to do itthe right way</s>  just stoop down before the man knows it and catch him bythe legs and tip him right over</s> ho</s>  i guess you see yourself</s>  said the little girl scornfully</s> well i could</s>  said the boy and some day ill just show you</s> now little cocksparrow now</s>  said the papa and he laughed</s>  wellthe little pony engine thought he could beat the pacific expressanyway and so one dark snowy blowy afternoon when his mother was offpushing some empty coal cars up past the knownothing crossing beyondcharlestown he got on the track in front of the express and when heheard the conductor say all aboard and the starting gong struck andthe brakemen leaned out and waved to the engineer he darted off likelightning</s>  he had his steam up and he just scuttled</s> well he was so excited for a while that he couldnt tell whether theexpress was gaining on him or not but after twenty or thirty miles hethought he heard it pretty near</s>  of course the express locomotive wasdrawing a heavy train of cars and it had to make a stop or twoatcharlestown and at concord junction and at ayerso the pony enginedid really gain on it a little and when it began to be scared it gaineda good deal</s>  but the first place where it began to feel sorry and towant its mother was in hoosac tunnel</s>  it never was in a tunnel beforeand it seemed as if it would never get out</s>  it kept thinking what ifthe pacific express was to run over it there in the dark and its motheroff there at the fitchburg depot in boston looking for it among thesidetracks</s>  it gave a perfect shriek and just then it shot out of thetunnel</s>  there were a lot of locomotives loafing around there at northadams and one of them shouted out to it as it flew by whats yourhurry little one</s>  and it just screamed back pacific express</s>  andnever stopped to explain</s>  they talked in locomotive languageoh what did it sound like</s>  the boy asked</s> well pretty queer ill tell you some day</s>  it knew it had no time tofool away and all through the long dark night whenever a locomotivehailed it it just screamed pacific express</s>  and kept on</s>  and theexpress kept gaining on it</s>  some of the locomotives wanted to stop itbut they decided they had better not get in its way and so it whizzedalong across new york state and ohio and indiana till it got tochicago</s>  and the express kept gaining on it</s>  by that time it was sohoarse it could hardly whisper but it kept saying pacific express</s> pacific express</s>  and it kept right on till it reached the mississippiriver</s>  there it found a long train of freight cars before it on thebridge</s>  it couldnt wait and so it slipped down from the track to theedge of the river and jumped across and then scrambled up theembankment to the track again</s> papa</s>  said the little girl warningly</s> truly it did said the papa</s> ho</s>  thats nothing said the boy</s>  a whole train of cars did it inthat jules verne book</s> well the papa went on after that it had a little rest for theexpress had to wait for the freight train to get off the bridge and thepony engine stopped at the first station for a drink of water and amouthful of coal and then it flew ahead</s>  there was a kind oldlocomotive at omaha that tried to find out where it belonged and whatits mothers name was but the pony engine was so bewildered it couldnttell</s>  and the express kept gaining on it</s>  on the plains it was chased bya pack of prairie wolves but it left them far behind and the antelopeswere scared half to death</s>  but the worst of it was when the nightmaregot after it</s> the nightmare</s>  goodness</s>  said the boy</s> ive had the nightmare said the little girl</s> oh yes a mere human nightmare said the papa</s>  but a locomotivenightmare is a very different thing</s> why whats it like</s>  asked the boy</s>  the little girl was almost afraidto ask</s> well it has only one leg to begin with</s>
pshaw</s> wheel i mean</s>
 and it has four cowcatchers and four headlights andtwo boilers and eight whistles and it just goes whirling andscreeching along</s>  of course it wobbles awfully and as its only got onewheel it has to keep skipping from one track to the other</s> i should think it would run on the crossties said the boy</s> oh very well then</s>  said the papa</s>  if you know so much more about itthan i do</s>  whos telling this story anyway</s>  now i shall have to go backto the beginning</s>  once there was a little pony enthey both put their hands over his mouth and just fairly begged him togo on and at last he did</s>  well it got away from the nightmare aboutmorning but not till the nightmare had bitten a large piece out of itstender and then it braced up for the homestretch</s>  it thought that ifit could once beat the express to the sierras it could keep the startthe rest of the way for it could get over the mountains quicker thanthe express could and it might be in san francisco before the expressgot to sacramento</s>  the express kept gaining on it</s>  but it just zippedalong the upper edge of kansas and the lower edge of nebraska and onthrough colorado and utah and nevada and when it got to the sierras itjust stooped a little and went over them like a goat it did trulyjust doubled up its fore wheels under it and jumped</s>  and the expresskept gaining on it</s>  by this time it couldnt say pacific express anymore and it didnt try</s>  it just said express</s>  express</s>  and thenpress</s>  press</s>  and then ess</s>  ess</s>  and pretty soon only ss</s> ss</s>  and the express kept gaining on it</s>  before they reached sanfrancisco the express locomotives cowcatcher was almost touching thepony engines tender it gave one howl of anguish as it felt the expresslocomotives hot breath on the place where the nightmare had bitten thepiece out and tore through the end of the san francisco depot andplunged into the pacific ocean and was never seen again</s>  there nowsaid the papa trying to make the children get down thats all</s>  go tobed</s>  the little girl was crying and so he tried to comfort her bykeeping her in his lap</s> the boy cleared his throat</s>  what is the moral papa</s>  he askedhuskily</s> children obey your parents said the papa</s> and what became of the mother locomotive</s>  pursued the boy</s> she had a brainfever and never quite recovered the use of her mindagain</s> the boy thought awhile</s>  well i dont see what it had to do withchristmas anyway</s> why it was christmas eve when the pony engine started from boston andchristmas afternoon when it reached san francisco</s> ho</s>  said the boy</s>  no locomotive could get across the continent in aday and a night let alone a little pony engine</s> but this pony engine had to</s>  did you never hear of the beaver thatclomb the tree</s> no</s>  tellyes some other time</s> but how could it get across so quick</s>  just one day</s> well perhaps it was a year</s>  maybe it was the next christmas afterthat when it got to san francisco</s> the papa set the little girl down and started to run out of the roomand both of the children ran after him to pound him</s> when they were in bed the boy called downstairs to the papa wellanyway i didnt put up my lip</s> the pumpkingloryillustrationthe papa had told the story so often that the children knew just exactlywhat to expect the moment he began</s>  they all knew it as well as he knewit himself and they could keep him from making mistakes or forgetting</s> sometimes he would go wrong on purpose or would pretend to forget andthen they had a perfect right to pound him till he quit it</s>  he usuallyquit pretty soon</s> the children liked it because it was very exciting and at the same timeit had no moral so that when it was all over they could feel that theyhad not been excited just for the moral</s>  the first time the little girlheard it she began to cry when it came to the worst part but the boyhad heard it so much by that time that he did not mind it in the leastand just laughed</s> the story was in season any time between thanksgiving and new years butthe papa usually began to tell it in the early part of october when thefarmers were getting in their pumpkins and the children were askingwhen they were going to have any squash pies and the boy had made hisfirst jackolantern</s> well the papa said once there were two little pumpkin seeds andone was a good little pumpkin seed and the other was badvery proudand vain and ambitious</s> the papa had told them what ambitious was and so the children did notstop him when he came to that word but sometimes he would stop of hisown accord and then if they could not tell what it meant he wouldpretend that he was not going on but he always did go on</s> well the farmer took both the seeds out to plant them in thehomepatch because they were a very extra kind of seeds and he was notgoing to risk them in the cornfield among the corn</s>  so before he putthem in the ground he asked each one of them what he wanted to be whenhe came up and the good little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up apumpkin and be made into a pie and be eaten at thanksgiving dinnerand the bad little pumpkin seed said he wanted to come up amorningglory</s> morningglory</s>  says the farmer</s>  i guess youll come up apumpkinglory first thing you know and then he hawhawed and toldhis son who was helping him to plant the garden to keep watch of thatparticular hill of pumpkins and see whether that little seed came up amorningglory or not and the boy stuck a stick into the hill so hecould tell it</s>  but one night the cow got in and the farmer was so madhaving to get up about one oclock in the morning to drive the cow outthat he pulled up the stick without noticing to whack her over theback with it and so they lost the place</s>
the good little pumpkin vine said oh im just going to stay hereand grow and grow and put out all the blossoms i can and let them alldrop off but one and then grow that into the biggest and fattest andsweetest pumpkin that ever was for thanksgiving pies</s> illustration two little pumpkin seeds</s> well thats what i am going to do too said the bad little pumpkinvine all but the pies but im not going to stay here to do it</s>  imgoing to that fence over there where the morningglories were lastsummer and im going to show them what a pumpkinglory is like</s>  imjust going to cover myself with blossoms and blossoms that wont shutup either when the sun comes out but ll stay open as if they hadntanything to be ashamed of and that wont drop off the first dayeither</s>  i noticed those morningglories all last summer when i wasnothing but one of the blossoms myself and i just made up my mind thatas soon as ever i got to be a vine i would show them a thing or two</s> maybe i cant be a morningglory but i can be a pumpkinglory and iguess thats glory enough</s> it made the cold chills run over the good little vine to hear itsbrother talk like that and it begged him not to do it and it began tocrywhats that</s>  the papa stopped short and the boy stopped whispering inhis sisters ear and she answeredhe said he bet it was a girl</s>  the tears stood in her eyes and the boysaidwell anyway it was like a girl</s> very well sir</s>  said the papa</s>  and supposing it was</s>  which is betterto stay quietly at home and do your duty and grow up and be eaten ina pie at thanksgiving or go gadding all over the garden and climbingfences and everything</s>  the good little pumpkin vine was perfectlyright and the bad little pumpkin would have been saved a good deal ifit had minded its little sister</s> the farmer was pretty busy that summer and after the first two orthree hoeings he had to leave the two pumpkin vines to the boy that hadhelped him to plant the seed and the boy had to go fishing so much andthen in swimming that he perfectly neglected them and let them runwild if they wanted to and if the good little pumpkin vine had notbeen the best little pumpkin vine that ever was it would have runwild</s>  but it just stayed where it was and thickened up and covereditself with blossoms till it was like one mass of gold</s>  it was veryfond of all its blossoms and it couldnt bear hardly to think of losingany of them but it knew they couldnt every one grow up to be a verylarge pumpkin and so it let them gradually drop off till it only hadone left and then it just gave all its attention to that one and dideverything it could to make it grow into the kind of pumpkin it said itwould</s> all this time the bad little pumpkin vine was carrying out its plan ofbeing a pumpkinglory</s>  in the first place it found out that if itexpected to get through by fall it couldnt fool much putting out a lotof blossoms and waiting for them to drop off before it began to devoteitself to business</s>  the fence was a good piece off and it had to reachthe fence in the first place for there wouldnt be any fun in being apumpkinglory down where nobody could see you or anything</s>  so the badlittle pumpkin vine began to pull and stretch towards the fence andsometimes it thought it would surely snap in two it pulled andstretched so hard</s>  but besides the pulling and stretching it had tohide and go round because if it had been seen it wouldnt have beenallowed to go to the fence</s>  it was a good thing there were so manyweeds that the boy was too lazy to pull up and the bad little pumpkinvine could hide among</s>  but then they were a good deal of a hinderancetoo because they were so thick it could hardly get through them</s>  it hadto pass some rows of pease that were perfectly awful they tiedthemselves to it and tried to keep it back and there was one hill ofcucumbers that acted ridiculously they said it was a cucumber vinerunning away from home and they would have kept it from going anyfarther if it hadnt tugged with all its might and main and got awayone night when the cucumbers were sleeping it was pretty stronganyway</s>  when it got to the fence at last it thought it was going todie</s>  it was all pulled out so thin that it wasnt any thicker than apiece of twine in some places and its leaves just hung in tatters</s>  ithadnt had time to put out more than one blossom and that was such apoor little sickly thing that it could hardly hang on</s>  the question washow can a pumpkin vine climb a fence anyway</s> its knees and elbows were all worn to strings getting there or thatswhat the pumpkin thought till it wound one of those tendrils round asplinter of the fence without thinking and happened to pull and thenit was perfectly surprised to find that it seemed to lift itself off theground a little</s>  it said to itself lets try a few more and ittwisted some more of the tendrils round some more splinters and thistime it fairly lifted itself off the ground</s>  it said ah i see</s>  as ifit had somehow expected to do something of the kind all along but ithad to be pretty careful getting up the fence not to knock its blossomoff for that would have been the end of it and when it did get upamong the morningglories it almost killed the poor thing keeping itopen night and day and showing it off in the hottest sun and notgiving it a bit of shade but just holding it out where it could be seenthe whole time</s>  it wasnt very much of a blossom compared with theblossoms on the good little pumpkin vine but it was bigger than any ofthe morningglories and that was some satisfaction and the bad littlepumpkin vine was as proud as if it was the largest blossom in the world</s> when the blossoms leaves dropped off and a little pumpkin began togrow on in its place the vine did everything it could for it just gaveitself up to it and put all its strength into it</s>  after all it was apretty queerlooking pumpkin though</s>  it had to grow hanging down andnot resting on anything and after it started with a round head likeother pumpkins its neck began to pull out and pull out till it lookedlike a gourd or a big pear</s>  thats the way it looked in the fallhanging from the vine on the fence when the first light frost came andkilled the vine</s>  it was the day when the farmer was gathering hispumpkins in the cornfield and he just happened to remember the seeds hehad planted in the homepatch and he got out of his wagon to see whathad become of them</s>  he was perfectly astonished to see the size of thegood little pumpkin you could hardly get it into a bushel basket andhe gathered it and sent it to the county fair and took the firstpremium with it</s> how much was the premium</s>  asked the boy</s>  he yawned he had heard allthese facts so often before</s> illustration took the first premium at the county fair</s> it was fifty cents but you see the farmer had to pay two dollars toget a chance to try for the premium at the fair and so it was somesatisfaction</s>  anyway he took the premium and he tried to sell thepumpkin and when he couldnt he brought it home and told his wife theymust have it for thanksgiving</s>  the boy had gathered the bad littlepumpkin and kept it from being fed to the cow it was so funnylookingand the day before thanksgiving the farmer found it in the barn and hesaidhollo</s>  heres that little fool pumpkin</s>  wonder if it thinks its amorningglory yet</s> and the boy said oh father maynt i have it</s> and the father said guess so</s>  what are you going to do with it</s> but the boy didnt tell because he was going to keep it for asurprise but as soon as his father went out of the barn he picked upthe bad little pumpkin by its long neck and he kind of balanced itbefore him and he said well now im going to make a pumpkingloryout of you</s> illustration heres that little fool pumpkin said the farmer</s> and when the bad little pumpkin heard that all its seeds fairlyrattled in it for joy</s>  the boy took out his knife and the first thingthe pumpkin knew he was cutting a kind of lid off the top of it it waslike getting scalped but the pumpkin didnt mind it because it wasjust the same as war</s>  and when the boy got the top off he poured theseeds out and began to scrape the inside as thin as he could withoutbreaking through</s>  it hurt awfully and nothing but the hope of being apumpkinglory could have kept the little pumpkin quiet but it didntsay a word even after the boy had made a mouth for it with two rows ofsplendid teeth and it didnt cry with either of the eyes he made forit just winked at him with one of them and twisted its mouth to oneside so as to let him know it was in the joke and the first thing itdid when it got one was to turn up its nose at the good little pumpkinwhich the boys mother came into the barn to get</s> show how it looked said the boy</s> and the papa twisted his mouth and winked with one eye and wrinkledhis nose till the little girl begged him to stop</s>  then he went onthe boy hid the bad pumpkin behind him till his mother was gonebecause he didnt want her in the secret and then he slipped into thehouse and put it under his bed</s>  it was pretty lonesome up there in theboys roomhe slept in the garret and there was nothing but brokenfurniture besides his bed but all day long it could smell the goodlittle pumpkin boiling and boiling for pies and late at night afterthe boy had gone to sleep it could smell the hot pies when they cameout of the oven</s>  they smelt splendid but the bad little pumpkin didntenvy them a bit it just said pooh</s>  whats twenty pumpkin pies to onepumpkinglory</s> it ought to have said what are oughtnt it papa</s>  asked thelittle girl</s> it certainly ought said the papa</s>  but if nothing but its grammarhad been bad there wouldnt have been much to complain of about it</s> i dont suppose it had ever heard much good grammar from the farmersfamily suggested the boy</s>  farmers always say cowcumbers instead ofcucumbers</s> oh do tell us about the cowcumber and the bullcumber and thelittle calfcumbers papa</s>  the little girl entreated and she claspedher hands to show how anxious she was</s> what</s>  and leave off at the most exciting part of the pumpkinglory</s> the little girl saw what a mistake she had made the boy just gave herone look and she cowered down into the papas lap and the papa wenton</s> well they had an extra big thanksgiving at the farmers that day</s>  lotsof the relations came from out west the grandmother who was livingwith the farmer was getting pretty old and every year or two shethought she wasnt going to live very much longer and she wrote to therelations in wisconsin and everywhere that if they expected to see heralive again they had better come this time and bring all theirfamilies</s>  she kept doing it till she was about ninety and then she justconcluded to live along and not mind how old she was</s>  but this was justbefore her eightyninth birthday and she had drummed up so many sonsand sonsinlaw and daughters and daughtersinlaw and grandsons andgreatgrandsons and granddaughters and greatgranddaughters that thehouse was perfectly packed with them</s>  they had to sleep on the floor agood many of them and you could hardly step for them the boys slept inthe barn and they laughed and cut up so the whole night that theroosters thought it was morning and kept crowing till they made theirthroats sore and had to wear wet compresses round them every night fora week afterwards</s> when the papa said anything like this the children had a right to poundhim but they were so anxious not to have him stop that this time theydid not do it</s>  they said go on go on</s>
 and the little girl said andthen the tables</s> tables</s>  well i should think so</s>  they got all the tables there were inthe house up stairs and down for dinner thanksgiving day and theytook the grandmothers workstand and put it at the head and she satdown there only she was so used to knitting by that table that she keptlooking for her knittingneedles all through dinner and couldnt seemto remember what it was she was missing</s>  the other end of the table wasthe carpenters bench that they brought in out of the barn and they putthe youngest and funniest papa at that</s>  the tables stretched from thekitchen into the diningroom and clear through that out into the halland across into the parlor</s>
 they hadnt tablecloths enough to go thewhole length and the end of the carpenters bench where the funniestpapa sat was bare and all through dinnertime he kept making fun</s>  thevise was right at the corner and when he got his help of turkey hepretended that it was so tough he had to fasten the bone in the viseand cut the meat off with his knife like a drawshave</s> it was the drumstick i suppose papa</s>  said the boy</s>  a turkeysdrumstick is all full of little wooden splinters anyway</s> and what did the mamma say</s>  asked the little girl</s> illustration caught his trousers on a shinglenail and stuck</s> oh she kept saying now you behave</s>  and well i should think youdbe ashamed</s>  but the funniest papa didnt mind her a bit and everybodylaughed till they could hardly stand it</s>  all this time the boys were outin the barn waiting for the second table and playing round</s>  thefarmers boy went up to his room over the woodshed and got in at thegarret window and brought out the pumpkinglory</s>  only he began toslip when he was coming down the roof and hed have slipped clear offif he hadnt caught his trousers on a shinglenail and stuck</s>  it made apretty bad tear but the other boys pinned it up so that it wouldntshow and the pumpkinglory wasnt hurt a bit</s>  they all said that it wasabout the best jackolantern they almost ever saw on account of thelong neck there was to it and they made a plan to stick the end of theneck into the top of the pump and have fun hearing what the folks wouldsay when they came out after dark and saw it all lit up and then theynoticed the pigpen at the corner of the barn and began to plague thepig and so many of them got up on the pen that they broke the middleboard off and they didnt like to nail it on again because it wasthanksgiving day and you mustnt hammer or anything so they just stuckit up in its place with a piece of wood against it and the boy said hewould fix it in the morning</s> the grown folks stayed so long at the table that it was nearly darkwhen the boys got to it and they would have been almost starved if thefarmboy hadnt brought out apples and doughnuts every little while</s>  asit was they were pretty hungry and they began on the pumpkin pie atonce so as to keep eating till the mother and the other mothers thatwere helping could get some of the things out of the oven that they hadbeen keeping hot for the boys</s>  the pie was so nice that they kept eatingat it all along and the mother told them about the good little pumpkinthat it was made of and how the good little pumpkin had never had anywish from the time it was nothing but a seed except to grow up and bemade into pies and eaten at thanksgiving and they must all try to begood too and grow up and do likewise</s>  the boys didnt say anythingbecause their mouths were so full but they looked at each other andwinked their left eyes</s>  there were about forty or fifty of them andwhen they all winked their left eyes it made it so dark you could hardlysee and the mother got the lamp but the other mothers saw what theboys were doing and they just shook them till they opened their eyesand stopped their mischief</s> show how they looked</s>  said the boy</s> i cant show how fifty boys looked said the papa</s>  but they looked agood deal like the pumpkinglory that was waiting quietly in the barnfor them to get through and come out and have some fun with it</s>  whenthey had all eaten so much that they could hardly stand up they gotdown from the table and grabbed their hats and started for the door</s> but they had to go out the back way because the table took up thefront entry and that gave the farmers boy a chance to find a piece ofcandle out in the kitchen and some matches and then they rushed to thebarn</s>  it was so dark there already that they thought they had betterlight up the pumpkinglory and try it</s>  they lit it up and it workedsplendidly but they forgot to put out the match and it caught somestraw on the barn floor and a little more and it would have burnt thebarn down</s>  the boys stamped the fire out in about half a second andafter that they waited till it was dark outside before they lit up thepumpkinglory again</s>  then they all bent down over it to keep the windfrom blowing the match anywhere and pretty soon it was lit up and thefarmers boy took the pumpkinglory by its long neck and stuck thepoint in the hole in the top of the pump and just then the funniestpapa came round the corner of the woodhouse and saidwhat have you got there boys</s>  jackolantern</s>  well well</s>  thats agood one</s> he came up and looked at the pumpkinglory and he bent back and hebent forward and he doubled down and he straightened up and laughedtill the boys thought he was going to kill himself</s> they had all intended to burst into an indian yell and dance round thepumpkinglory but the funniest papa said now all you fellows keepstill half a minute and the next thing they knew he ran into thehouse and came out walking his wife before him with both his handsover her eyes</s>  then the boys saw he was going to have some fun with herand they kept as still as mice and waited till he walked her up to thepumpkinglory and she was saying all the time now john if this issome of your fooling ill give it to you</s>  when he got her close uphe took away his hands and she gave a kind of a whoop and then shebegan to laugh the pumpkinglory was so funny and to chase thefunniest papa all round the yard to box his ears and as soon as she hadboxed them she said now lets go in and send the rest out and inabout a quarter of a second all the other papas came out holding theirhands over the other mothers eyes till they got them up to thepumpkinglory and then there was such a yelling and laughing andchasing and earboxing that you never heard anything like it and all atonce the funniest papa hallooed out wheres gramma</s>  grammas got tosee it</s>  grandmall enjoy it</s>  its just grammas kind of joke and thenthe mothers all got round him and said he shouldnt fool thegrandmother anyway and he said he wasnt going to he was just goingto bring her out and let her see it and his wife went along with him towatch that he didnt begin acting up</s> the grandmother had been sitting all alone in her room ever sincedinner because she was always afraid somehow that if you enjoyedyourself it was a sign you were going to suffer for it and she hadenjoyed herself a good deal that day and she was feeling awfully aboutit</s>  when the funniest papa and his wife came in she said what is it</s> what is it</s>  is the world aburnin up</s>
 well you got to wrap up warmthen or youll ketch your death o cold runnin and then stoppin torest with your pores all open</s> the funniest papas wife she went up and kissed her and said nograndmother the worlds all right and then she told her just how itwas and how they wanted her to come out and see the jackolanternjust to please the children and she must come anyway because it wasthe funniest jackolantern there ever was and then she told how thefunniest papa had fooled her and then how they had got the other papasto fool the other mothers and they had all had the greatest fun thenyou ever saw</s>  all the time she kept putting on her things for her andthe grandmother seemed to get quite in the notion and she laughed alittle and they thought she was going to enjoy it as much as anybodythey really did because they were all very tender of her and theywouldnt have scared her for anything and everybody kept cheering herup and telling her how much they knew she would like it till they gother to the pump</s>  the little pumpkinglory was feeling awfully proud andselfsatisfied for it had never seen any flower or any vegetabletreated with half so much honor by human beings</s>  it wasnt sure at firstthat it was very nice to be laughed at so much but after a while itbegan to conclude that the papas and the mammas were just laughing atthe joke of the whole thing</s>  when the old grandmother got up closeit thought it would do something extra to please her or else the heatof the candle had dried it up so that it cracked without intending to</s> anyway it tried to give a very broad grin and all of a sudden it splitits mouth from ear to ear</s> illustration my sakes</s>  its comin to life</s> you didnt say it had any ears before said the boy</s> no it had them behind said the papa and the boy felt like givinghim just one pound but he thought it might stop the story and so helet the papa go on</s> as soon as the grandmother saw it open its mouth that way she just gaveone scream my sakes</s>  its comin to life</s>  and she threw up her armsand she threw up her feet and if the funniest papa hadnt been there tocatch her and if there hadnt been forty or fifty other sons anddaughters and grandsons and daughters and greatgrandsons andgreatgranddaughters very likely she might have fallen</s>  as it wasthey piled round her and kept her up but there were so many of themthey jostled the pump and the first thing the pumpkinglory knew itfell down and burst open and the pig that the boys had plagued andthat had kept squealing all the time because it thought

the pig ate the candle it looked like the magician when heputs burning tow in his mouth said the boy</s> exactly said the papa</s> the children were both silent for a moment</s>  then the boy said thisstory never had any moral i believe papa</s> not a bit said the papa</s>  unless he added the moral was that youhad better not be ambitious unless you want to come to the sad end ofthis proud little pumpkinglory</s> why but the good little pumpkin was eaten up too said the boy</s> thats true the papa acknowledged</s> well said the little girl theres a great deal of differencebetween being eaten by persons and eaten by pigs</s> all the difference in the world said the papa and he laughed andran out of the library before the boy could get at him</s> illustrationbutterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterflyillustrationone morning when the papa was on a visit to the grandfather the nephewand the niece came rushing into his room and got into bed with him</s>  hepretended to be asleep and even when they grabbed hold of him and shookhim he just let his teeth clatter and made no sign of waking up</s>  butthey knew he was fooling and they kept shaking him till he opened hiseyes and looked round and said oh oh</s>  where am i</s>  as if he were allbewildered</s> youre in bed with us</s>  they shouted and they acted as if they wereafraid he would try to get away from them by the way they held on tohis arms</s> but he lay quite still and he only said i should say you were inbed with me</s>  it seems to be my bed</s> its the same thing</s>  said the nephew</s> how do you make that out</s>  asked the papa</s>  its the same thing if itsenchantment</s>  but if it isnt it isnt</s> the niece said what enchantment</s>  for she thought that would be apretty good chance to get what they had come for</s> she was perfectly delighted and gave a joyful thrill all over when thepapa said oh thats a long story</s> well the longer the better i should say shouldnt you brother</s> she returned</s> the nephew hemmed twice in his throat and asked drowsily is it alittlepig story or a fairyprince story</s>  for he had heard from hiscousins that their papa would tell you a littlepig story if he got thechance and you had to look out and ask him which it was going to bebeforehand</s> well i cant tell said the papa</s>  its a fairyprince story to beginwith but it may turn out a littlepig story before it gets to the end</s> it depends upon how the prince behaves</s>  but im not anxious to tellit and the papa put his face into the pillow and pretended to fallinstantly asleep again</s> now brother you see</s>  said the niece</s>  being so particular</s> well sister said the nephew it wasnt my fault</s>  i had to askhim</s>  you know what they said</s> well i suppose weve got to wake him up all over again said theniece with a little sigh and they began to pull at the papa this wayand that but they could not budge him</s>  as soon as they stopped heopened his eyes</s> now dont say where am i</s>  said the niece</s> the papa could not help laughing because that was just the very thinghe was going to say</s>  well all right</s>  what about that story</s>  do youwant to hear it and take your chances of its being a prince to theend</s> i suppose well have to wont we sister</s> yes well leave it all to you uncle said the niece and she thoughtshe would coax him up a little and so she went on i know you wont bemean about it</s>  will he brother</s> no said the nephew</s>  ill bet the prince will keep a prince all theway through</s>  whatll you bet sister</s> i wont bet anything said the niece and she put her arm round thepapas neck and pressed her cheek up against his</s>  ill just leave itto uncle and if it does turn into a littlepig story itll be forthe moral</s> the nephew was not quite sure what a moral was but at the bottom of hisheart he would just as soon have it a littlepig story as not</s>  he hadgot to thinking how funny a little pig would look in a princes clothesand he said yes itll be for the moral</s> the papa was very contrary that morning</s>  well said he i dont knowabout that</s>  im not sure theres going to be any moral</s> oh goody</s>  said the niece and she clapped her hands in great delight</s> then its going to be a prince story all through</s> if you interrupt me in that way its not going to be any story atall</s> i didnt know you had begun it uncle pleaded the niece</s> well i hadnt</s>  but i was just going to</s>  the papa lay quiet a while</s> the fact is he had not thought up any story at all and he was so tiredof all the stories he used to tell his own children that he could notbear to tell one of them though he knew very well that the niece andnephew would be just as glad of it as if it were new and maybe gladderfor they had heard a great deal about these stories how perfectlysplendid they werelike the pumpkinglory and the little pig that tookthe poison pills and the proud little horsecar that fell in love withthe pullman sleeper and jap doll hopsings adventures in crossing thecontinent and the enchantment of the greedy travellers and the littleboy whose legs turned into bicycle wheels</s>  at last the papa said thisis a very peculiar kind of a story</s>  its about a prince and a princess</s> oh</s>  went both of the children and then they stopped themselves andstuffed the covering into their mouths</s> the papa lifted himself on his elbow and stared severely at them firstat one and then at the other</s>  have you finished</s>  he asked as ifthey had interrupted him but he really wanted to gain time so as tothink up a story of some kind</s>  the children were afraid to say anythingand the papa went on with freezing politeness because if you have imight like to say something myself</s>  this story is about a prince and aprincess but the thing of it is that they had names almost exactlyalike</s>  they were twins the prince was a boy and the princess was agirl that was a point that their fairy godmother carried against thewicked enchantress who tried to have it just the other way but it madethe wicked enchantress so mad that the fairy godmother had to give in toher a little and let them be named almost exactly alike</s> here the papa stopped and after waiting for him to go on the nephewventured to ask very respectfully indeed would you mind telling uswhat their names were uncle</s> the papa rubbed his forehead</s>
 i have such a bad memory for names</s>  holdon</s>  wait a minute</s>  i remember now</s>  their names were butterflyflutterbyand flutterbybutterfly</s>  of course he had just thought up the names</s>
and which was which uncle dear</s>  asked the niece not only veryrespectfully but very affectionately too she was so afraid he wouldget mad again and stop altogether</s> why i should think you would know a girls name when you heard it</s> butterflyflutterby was the prince and flutterbybutterfly was theprincess</s> i dont see how were ever going to keep them apart sighed the niece</s> youve got to keep them apart said the papa</s>  because its thegreat thing about the story that if you cant remember which is theprince and which is the princess whenever i ask you the story has tostop</s>  it cant help it and i cant help it</s> they knew he was just setting a trap for them and the same thoughtstruck them both at once</s>  they rose up and leaned over the papa withtheir arms across and their fluffy heads together in the form of acapital letter a and whispered in each others ears you say its oneand ill say its the other and then well have it right between us</s> they dropped back and pulled the covering up to their chins andshouted dont you tell</s>  dont you tell</s>  and just perfectly wriggledwith triumph</s> the papa had heard every word they were laughing so that they whisperedalmost as loud as talking but he pretended that he had not understoodand he made up his mind that he would have them yet</s>  a little and amore he said and i should never have gone on again</s> go on</s>  go on</s>  they called out and then they wriggled and giggledtill anybody would have thought they were both crazy</s> well where was i</s>  this was another of the papas tricks to gain time</s> whenever he could not think of anything more he always asked wellwhere was i</s>  he now added oh yes</s>  i remember</s>  well once there were aprince and a princess and their names were butterflyflutterby andflutterbybutterfly and they were both twins and both orphans but theymade their home with their fairy godmother as long as they were littleand they used to help her about the house for part board and she helpedthem about their kingdom and kept it in good order for them and leftthem plenty of time to play and enjoy themselves</s>  she was the greatestperson for order there ever was and if she found a speck of dust ordirt on the kingdom anywhere she would have out the whole army and makethem wash it up and then sandpaper the place and polish it with acoarse towel till it perfectly glistened</s>  the father of the prince andprincess had taken the precaution before he died to subdue all hisenemies and the consequence was that the longest kind of peace had setin and the army had nothing to do but keep the kingdom clean</s>  that wasthe reason why the fairy godmother had made the generalinchief taketheir guns away and arm them with long featherdusters</s>  they marchedwith the poles on their shoulders and carried the dusters in theirbelts like bayonets and whenever they came to a place that the fairygodmother said needed dustingshe always went along with them in adiamond chariotshe made the general halloo out fix dusters</s>  makeready</s>  aim</s>  dust</s>  and then the place would be cleaned up</s>  but thegeneralinchief used to go out behind the church and cry it mortifiedhim so to have to give such orders and it reminded him so painfully ofthe good old times when he would order his men to charge the enemy andcover the field with gore and blood instead of having it so awfullyspickandspan as it was now</s>  still he did what the fairy godmother toldhim because he said it was his duty and he kept his troops suppliedwith sudsine and dustene to clean up with and brushes and towels</s>  thefairy godmotherillustration fix dusters</s>  make ready</s>  aim</s>  dust</s> excuse me uncle said the nephew with extreme deference but ishould just like to ask you one question</s>  will you let me</s> what is it</s>  said the papa in the grimmest kind of manner he could puton</s> ah brother</s>  murmured the niece for she knew that he was rathersarcastic and she was afraid that something ironical was coming</s> illustration the generalinchief used to go behind the church andcry</s> well i just wanted to ask whether this story was about the fairygodmother or about the prince and princess</s> very well now said the papa</s>  youve asked your question</s>  i didntpromise to answer it and im happy to say it stops the story</s>  illguess ill go to sleep again</s>  i dont like being waked up this way inthe middle of the night anyhow</s> now brother i hope youre satisfied</s>  said the niece</s> the nephew evaded the point</s>  he said well sister if the story reallyisnt going on i should like to ask uncle another question</s>  how big wasthe fairy godmothers diamond chariot</s> it was the usual sized chariot answered the papa</s> whew</s>  it must have been a pretty big diamond then</s> it was a very big diamond said the papa and he seemed to forgetall about being mad or else he had thought up some more of the storyto tell for he went on just as if nothing had happened</s>  the fairygodmother was so severe with the dirt she found because it was a royalprerogativethat is nobody but the king or the kings family had aright to make a mess and if other people did it they were infringingon the royal prerogative</s> you know the papa explained that in old times and countries theroyal family have been allowed to do things that no other family wouldhave been associated with if they had done them</s>  that is about the onlyuse there is in having a royal family</s>  but the fairy godmother ofprincebutterflyflutterby said the niece</s> and princessflutterbybutterfly said the nephew</s> correct said the papa</s> the children rose up into a capital a again and whispered he didntcatch us that time and fell back laughing and the papa had to goon</s> the fairy godmother thought she would try to bring up the prince andprincess rather better than most princes and princesses were brought upand so she said that the only thing they should be allowed to dodifferent from other people was to make a mess</s>  if any other personswere caught making a mess they were banished and there was another lawthat was perfectly awful</s> whatwasitgoahead</s>  said the nephew running all his words togetherhe was so anxious to know</s> why if any person was found clearing up anywhere and it turned out tobe a mess that the royal twins had made the person was thrown from atower</s> did it kill them</s>  the niece inquired rather faintly</s> well no it didnt kill them exactly but it bounced them up prettyhigh</s>  you see they fell on a bed of indiarubber about twenty feetdeep</s>
 it gave them a good scare and thats the great thing in throwingpersons from a high tower</s> the nephew hastened to improve the opportunity which seemed to be givenfor asking questions</s> what do you mean exactly by making a mess uncle</s>
oh scattering scraps of paper about or scuffing the landscape orgetting jam or molasses on the face of nature or having bonfires in theback yard of the palace or leaving dolls around on the throne</s>  but whatdid i say about asking questions</s>  now theres another thing about thisstory when it comes to the exciting part if you move the least bit oreven breathe loud the story stops just as if you didnt know which wasthe prince and which was the princess</s>  now do you understand</s> the children both said yes in a very small whisper and cowered downalmost under the clothing and held on tight so as to keep fromstirring</s> illustration the young khan and khant entered the kingdom with amagnificent retinue</s> the papa went on well about the time they had got these two laws infull force and forty or fifty thousand boys and girls had been banishedfor making a mess and pretty nearly all the neat old ladies in thekingdom had been thrown from a high tower for cleaning up after theprince and princess butterflyflutterby and flutterbybutterfly theyoung khan and khant of tartary entered the kingdom with a magnificentretinue of followers to select a bride and groom from the children ofthe royal family</s>  as there were no children in the royal family exceptthe twins the choice of the khan and khant naturally fell upon theprincebutterflyflutterby</s> and the princessflutterbybutterfly</s> correct</s>  it also happened that the khan and the khant were brother andsister but if you cant tell which was the brother and which was thesister the story stops at this point</s> why but uncle said the little girl reproachfully you haventever told us which is which yourself yet</s> i know it</s>  because im waiting to find out</s>  you see with these asiaticnames its impossible sometimes to tell which is which</s>  you have to waitand see how they will act</s>  if there had been a battle anywhere and oneof them had screamed and run away then i suppose i should have beenpretty sure it was the sister but even then i shouldnt know which wasthe khan and which was the khant</s> well what are we going to do about it then</s>  asked the nephew</s> i dont know said the papa</s>  we shall just have to keep on and see</s> perhaps when they meet the prince and princess we shall find out</s>  idont suppose a boy would fall in love with a boy</s> no said the niece but he might want to go off with him and havefun or something</s> thats true said the papa</s>  weve got to all watch out</s>  of course thekhan and the khant scuffed the landscape awfully as they came alongthrough the kingdom and got the face of nature all daubed up withmarmaladethey were the greatest persons for marmaladeand when theyreached the palace of the prince and princess they had to camp out inthe back yard and they had to have bonfires to cook by and they made afrightful mess</s> well there was the greatest excitement about it that there ever was</s> the generalinchief kept his men under arms night and day and thefairy godmother was so worked up she almost had a brainfever and ifshe had not taken six of aconite every night when she went to bed

family and sonobody dared to clean up after them</s>  the whole kingdom was in the mostdisgusting state and whenever the fairy godmother looked into the backyard of the palace she felt as if she would go through the floor</s> illustration she was going to take the case into her own hands</s> well it kept on going from bad to worse</s>  the only person that enjoyedherself was the wicked enchantress she never had such a good time inher life and when the fairy godmother got hold of the grand vizier andthe cadi and told them to make a new law so as to allow the army toclean up after royal visitors without being thrown from a high towerthe wicked enchantress enchanted the whole mess so that the army couldnot tell which the prince and princess had made and which the khan andkhant had made they were all four always playing together anyway</s> it seemed as if the poor old fairy godmother would go perfectly wildand she almost made the general crazy giving orders in one breath andtaking them back in the next</s>  she said that now something had got to bedone she had stood it long enough and she was going to take the caseinto her own hands</s>  she saw that she should have no peace of her lifetill the prince and princess and the khan and khant were married</s>  shesent for the head imam and told him to bring those children right inand marry them and she would be responsible</s> the imam put his head to the floorand it was pretty hard on him forhe was short and stout and he had to do it kind of sidewaysand saidto hear was to obey but he could not marry them unless he knew whichwas which</s> the fairy godmother screamed out i dont care which is which</s>  marrythem all just as they are</s> but when she came to think it over she saw that this would not do andso she tried to invent some way out of the trouble</s>  one morning she wokeup with a splendid idea and she could hardly wait to have breakfastbefore she sent for the generalinchief</s>  her nerves were all gone andas soon as she saw him she yelled at him a sham battletodaynowthisvery instant</s>
illustration the imam put his head to the floor</s> the general got her to explain herself and then he understood that shewanted him to have a grand review and sham battle of all the troops inhonor of the khan and khant and the whole court had to be present andespecially the timidest of the ladies that would almost scare a personto death by the way they screamed when they were frightened</s>  the generalwas just going to say that the guns and cannon had all got rusty andthe powder was spoiled from not having been used for so long with theeverlasting cleaning up that had been going on but the fairy godmotherstamped her foot and sent him flying</s>  so the only thing he could do wasto set all the gnomes at work making guns and cannon and powder andabout twelve oclock they had them ready and just after lunch the shambattle began</s> the troops marched and countermarched and fired away the wholeafternoon and sprang mines and blew up magazines and threw cannoncrackers and cannon torpedoes</s>  there was such an awful din and racketthat you couldnt hear yourself think and some of the court ladies weremade perfectly sick by it</s>  they all asked to be excused but the fairygodmother wouldnt excuse one of them</s>  she just kept them there on theseats round the battlefield and let them shriek themselves hoarse</s>  somany of them fainted that they had to have the garden hose brought andthey kept it sprinkling away on their faces all the afternoon</s> illustration they began to scream oh the cow</s>  the cow</s> but it was a failure as far as the khan and the khant were concerned</s> the fairy godmother expected that as soon as the loudest firing beganthe girl whichever it was would scream and so they would knowwhich was which</s>  but the khan and khants father had been a famouswarrior and he had been in the habit of taking his children to battlewith him from their earliest years partly because his wife was dead andhe didnt dare trust them with the careless nurse at home and partlybecause he wanted to harden their nerves</s>  so now they just clapped theirhands and enjoyed the sham battle down to the ground</s> about sunset the fairy godmother gave it up</s>  she had to anyway</s>  thetroops had shot away all their powder and the gnomes couldnt make anymore till the next day</s>  so she set out to return to the city with allthe court following her diamond chariot and i can tell you she feltpretty gloomy</s>  she told the grand vizier that now she didnt see any endto the trouble and she was just going into hysterics when a barefootedboy came along driving his cow home from the pasture</s>  the fairygodmother didnt mind it much for she was in her chariot but the courtladies were on foot and they began to scream oh the cow</s>  the cow</s> and to take hold of the knights and to get on to the fence till it wasperfectly packed with them and who do you think the fairy godmotherfound had scrambled up on top of her chariot</s> the nephew and niece were afraid to risk a guess and the papa had tosaythe khant</s>  the fairy godmother pulled her inside and hugged her andkissed her she was so glad to find out that she was the one and shestopped the procession on the spot and she called up the imam and hemarried the khant to princethe papa stopped and as the niece and nephew hesitated he said verysternly well</s> the fact is they had got so mixed up about the khan and the khant oftartary that they had forgotten which was butterflyflutterby and whichwas flutterbybutterfly</s>  they tried shouting out one the one and theother the other but the papa saidoh no</s>  that wont work</s>  ive had that sort of thing tried on me beforeand it never works</s>  i heard you whispering what you would do andyou have simply added the crime of doubledealing to the crime ofinattention</s>  the story has stopped and stopped forever</s> the nephew stretched himself and then sat up in bed</s>  well it had gotto the end anyway</s> oh had it</s>  what became of the wicked enchantress</s>  the nephew laydown again in considerable dismay</s> uncle said the niece very coaxingly i didnt say it had come tothe end</s> but it has said the papa</s>  and im mighty glad you forgot theprinces name for the rule of this story is that it has to go on aslong as any one listening remembers and it might have gone onforever</s> i suppose the nephew said a person may guess</s> he may if he guesses right</s>
