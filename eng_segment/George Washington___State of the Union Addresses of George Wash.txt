announce to you that duringyour recess some of the citizens of the united states have been foundcapable of insurrection</s>  it is due however to the character of ourgovernment and to its stability which can not be shaken by the enemies oforder freely to unfold the course of this event</s> during the session of the year 1790 it was expedient to exercise thelegislative power granted by the constitution of the united states to layand collect excises</s>  in a majority of the states scarcely an objection washeard to this mode of taxation</s>  in some indeed alarms were at firstconceived until they were banished by reason and patriotism</s>  in the fourwestern counties of pennsylvania a prejudice fostered and imbittered bythe artifice of men who labored for an ascendency over the will of othersby the guidance of their passions produced symptoms of riot and violence</s> it is well known that congress did not hesitate to examine the complaintswhich were presented and to relieve them as far as justice dictated orgeneral convenience would permit</s>  but the impression which this moderationmade on the discontented did not correspond with what it deserved</s>  the artsof delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designingindividuals</s>  the very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpretedinto a fear of urging the execution of the laws and associations of menbegan to denounce threats against the officers employed</s>  from a belief thatby a more formal concert their operation might be defeated certainselfcreated societies assumed the tone of condemnation</s>  hence while thegreater part of pennsylvania itself were conforming themselves to the actsof excise a few counties were resolved to frustrate them</s>  it is nowperceived that every expectation from the tenderness which had beenhitherto pursued was unavailing and that further delay could only createan opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government</s>  legal processwas therefore delivered to the marshal against the rioters and delinquentdistillers</s> no sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty than the vengeanceof armed men was aimed at his person and the person and property of theinspector of the revenue</s>  they fired upon the marshal arrested him anddetained him for some time as a prisoner</s>  he was obliged by the jeopardyof his life to renounce the service of other process on the west side ofthe allegheny mountain and a deputation was afterwards sent to him todemand a surrender of that which he had served</s>  a numerous body repeatedlyattacked the house of the inspector seized his papers of office andfinally destroyed by fire his buildings and whatsoever they contained</s>  bothof these officers from a just regard to their safety fled to the seat ofgovernment it being avowed that the motives to such outrages were tocompel the resignation of the inspector to withstand by force of arms theauthority of the united states and thereby to extort a repeal of the lawsof excise and an alteration in the conduct of government</s> upon testimony of these facts an associate justice of the supreme court ofthe united states notified to me that in the counties of washington andallegheny in pennsylvania laws of the united states were opposed and theexecution thereof obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressedby the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested inthe marshal of that district</s> on this call momentous in the extreme i sought and weighted what mightbest subdue the crisis</s>  on the one hand the judiciary was pronounced to bestripped of its capacity to enforce the laws crimes which reached the veryexistence of social order were perpetrated without control the friends ofgovernment were insulted abused and overawed into silence or an apparentacquiescence and to yield to the treasonable fury of so small a portion ofthe united states would be to violate the fundamental principle of ourconstitution which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail</s>  onthe other to array citizen against citizen to publish the dishonor ofsuch excesses to encounter the expense and other embarrassments of sodistant an expedition were steps too delicate too closely interwoven withmany affecting considerations to be lightly adopted</s> i postponed therefore the summoning of the militia immediately into thefield but i required them to be held in readiness that if my anxiousendeavors to reclaim the deluded and to convince the malignant of theirdanger should be fruitless military force might be prepared to act beforethe season should be too far advanced</s>
 they were authorized to conferwith any bodies of men or individuals</s>  they were instructed to becandid and explicit in stating the sensations which had been excited in theexecutive and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to coercion torepresent however that without submission coercion must be the resortbut to invite them at the same time to return to the demeanor of faithfulcitizens by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of executivepower</s>  pardon too was tendered to them by the government of the unitedstates and that of pennsylvania upon no other condition than asatisfactory assurance of obedience to the laws</s> although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness andabilities and must unite all virtuous men by shewing that the means ofconciliation have been exhausted all of those who had committed or abettedthe tumults did not subscribe the mild form which was proposed as theatonement and the indications of a peaceable temper were neithersufficiently general nor conclusive to recommend or warrant the furthersuspension of the march of the militia</s> thus the painful alternative could not be discarded</s>
it was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision the lowest degreeof force competent to the quelling of the insurrection</s>  from a respectindeed to economy and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to themilitia it would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate</s>  my veryreluctance to ascribe too much importance to the opposition had its extentbeen accurately seen would have been a decided inducement to the smallestefficient numbers</s>  in this uncertainty therefore i put into motion fifteenthousand men as being an army which according to all human calculationwould be prompt and adequate in every view and might perhaps by renderingresistance desperate prevent the effusion of blood</s>  quotas had beenassigned to the states of new jersey pennsylvania maryland and virginiathe governor of pennsylvania having declared on this occasion an opinionwhich justified a requisition to the other states</s> as commander in chief of the militia when called into the actual

the laws were secure fromobstruction that the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such ofthe most culpable as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty andmay be deemed fit objects of

actuated manyof the offenders</s>  if the state of things had afforded reason for thecontinuance of my presence with the army it would not have beenwithholden</s>  but every appearance assuring such an issue as will redound tothe reputation and strength of the united states i have judged it mostproper to resume my duties at the seat of government leaving the chiefcommand with the governor of

betoo early occupied with this subject</s> among the discussions which may arise from this aspect of our affairs andfrom the documents which will be submitted to congress it will not escapetheir observation that not only the inspector of the revenue but otherofficers of the united states in pennsylvania have from their fidelity inthe discharge of their functions sustained material injuries to

whether it has not been fomented by combinations of men whocareless of consequences and disregarding the unerring truth that those whorouse can not always appease a civil convulsion have disseminated from anignorance or perversion of facts suspicions jealousies and accusationsof the whole government</s> having thus fulfilled the engagement which i took when i entered intooffice to the best of my
