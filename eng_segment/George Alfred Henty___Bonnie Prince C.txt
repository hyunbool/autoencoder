bonnie prince charliea tale of fontenoy and cullodenby g</s>  a</s>  hentychapter i the return of a prodigal</s> it was a dull evening in the month of september 1728</s>  the apprenticeshad closed and barred the shutters and the days work was over</s>  supperwas laid in the long room over the shop the viands were on the tableand round it were standing bailie anderson and his wife his foreman johngillespie and his two apprentices</s>  the latter were furtively eying theeatables and wondering how much longer the grace which their master wasdelivering would be</s>  suddenly there was a knock at the door below</s>  no onestirred until the bailie had finished his grace before which time theknock had been twice repeated</s> elspeth woman the bailie said when he had brought the grace to anend go down below and see who knocks so impatiently look through thegrille before you open the door these are nor times when one opens tothe first stranger who knocks</s> the old servant who had been standing behind her mistress wentdownstairs</s>  the door was opened and they heard an exclamation ofsurprise at the answer to her question who is it thats knocking as ifthe house belonged to him</s> those gathered up stairs heard the bolts withdrawn</s>  there was a confusedsound of talking and then a heavy step was heard ascending the stairsand without introduction a tall man wrapped in a cloak and carrying achild of some two years old strode into the room</s>  he threw his hat on toa settle and advanced straight towards the bailie who looked in surpriseat this unceremonious entry</s> dont you know me andrew</s> heaven preserve us the bailie exclaimed why its malcolm</s> malcolm himself the visitor repeated sound in wind and limb</s> the lord be praised</s>  the bailie exclaimed as he grasped the othershand and wrung it warmly</s>  i had thought you dead years and years ago</s> janet this is my brother malcolm of whom you have often heard me speak</s> and of whom you can have heard little good mistress if my brother hasspoken the truth concerning me</s>  i was ever a neer do well while andrewstruck hard and fast to our fathers trade</s> my husband has ever spoken with affection of you janet anderson said</s> the bailie is not given to speak ill of any much less of his own fleshand blood</s> and now sit down malcolm</s>  supper is waiting and you are i doubt notready for it</s>  it is ill talking to a fasting man</s>  when you have done youshall tell me what you have been doing for the last fifteen years andhow it comes that you thus suddenly come back among us with your boy</s> he is no boy of mine malcolm said but i will tell you all about itpresently</s>  first let me lay him down on that settle for the poor littlechap is fast asleep and dead tired out</s>  elspeth roll up my cloak andmake a pillow for him</s>  thats right he will do nicely now</s>  you arechanged less than any of us elspeth</s>  just as hard to look at and idoubt not just as soft at heart as you used to be when you tried toshield me when i got into scrapes</s>  and now to supper</s> little was said during the meal fortunately the table was bounteouslyspread for the newcomers appetite was prodigious but at last he wassatisfied and after a long drink at the horn beside him which elspethhad kept filled with ale he saidtheres nothing like a scottish meal after all andrew</s>  french living iswell enough for a time but one tires of it and many a time when i havebeen lying down supperless on the sod after marching and fighting thewhole day i have longed for a bowl of porridge and a platter well filledwith oatmeal cakes</s> supper over john and the apprentices retired</s>  elspeth went off toprepare the guests chamber and to make up a little bed for the child</s> now brother let us hear your story but first of all perhaps youwant to light your pipe</s> that do i malcolm replied if mistress janet has no objectionthereto</s> she is accustomed to it the bailie said answering for her</s>  i smokemyself i deem that tobacco like other things was given for our useand methinks that with a pipe between the lips mens brains work moreeasily and that it leadeth to pleasant converse</s> janet went to a cupboard brought out two long pipes and a jar oftobacco placed two tumblers a flat bottle and a jug of water on thetable</s> that is right the bailie said</s>  i do not often touch strong waters</s> the habit as i see too plainly is a harmful one and in this good cityof glasgow there are many even of those so placed that they should be anexample to their fellows who are given nightly to drink more than isgood for them but on an occasion like the present i deem it no harm totake a glass</s> i should think not malcolm said heartily it is long since i tasted aglass of real scotch spirit and i never need an excuse for taking aglass of whatever it be that comes in my way</s>  not mistress janet that iam a toper</s>  i dont say that at the sack of a town or at times whenliquor is running so to speak to waste i am more backward than therest but my hand wouldnt be as steady as it is if i had been one ofthose who are never so happy as when they are filling themselves withliquor</s>  and now andrew to my story</s>  you know that when i saw you last just when the troubles in 15 began  in spite of all your warningsto the contrary i must needs throw myself into the thick of them</s>  youlike a wise man stuck to your shop and here you are now a bailie ofglasgow while i who have been wandering over the face of the earthfighting for the cause of france and risking my life a thousand times ina matter which concerned me in no way have returned just as penniless asi set out</s> it is said brother malcolm janet said mildly that a rolling stonegathers no moss</s> that is true enough malcolm assented and yet do you know there arefew rolling stones who if their time were to come over again wouldremain fixed in their bed</s>  of course we have not the pleasures of homeof wives and children but the life of adventure has its own joys whichi for one would not change for the others</s>  however brother as youknow i threw myself heart and soul into that business</s> the last time i saw you was just as i was starting with a score ofothers to make our way to join the earl of mars army at perth</s>  i haveseen many an army since but never did i see sixteen thousand finerfighting men than were there assembled</s>  the laird of mackintosh broughtfive hundred clansmen from inverness shire the marquis of huntly hadfive hundred horse and two thousand foot and the earl marischal had athousand men</s>  the laird of glenlyon brought five hundred campbells andthe marquis of tullibardine fourteen hundred and a score of other chiefsof less power were there with their clansmen</s>  there were enough men thereto have done anything had they been properly armed and led but thougharms and ammunition had been promised from france none came and theearl of mar had so little decision that he would have wrecked the finestarmy that ever marched</s> the army lay doing nothing for weeks and just before we were expectinga movement the company i belonged to was sent with a force ofhighlanders under mackintosh to join the army under the lordsderwentwater kenmure and nithsdale</s>  lord derwentwater had risen with anumber of other gentlemen and with their attendants and friends hadmarched against newcastle</s>  they had done nothing there but remained idlenear hexham till joined by a force raised in the lowlands of scotland bythe earls of nithsdale carnwath and wintoun the united army marchednorth again to kelso where we joined them</s> we scots soon saw that we had gained nothing by the change ofcommanders</s>  lord derwentwater was ignorant of military affairs and hewas greatly swayed by a mr</s>  forster who was somehow at the head of thebusiness and who was not only incompetent but proved to be a coward ifnot as most folks believed a traitor</s>  so dissension soon broke out andfour hundred highlanders marched away north</s>  after a long delay it wasresolved to move south where it was said we should be joined by greatnumbers in lancashire but by this time all had greatly lost spirit andhope in the enterprise</s>  we crossed the border and marched down throughpenrith appleby and kendal to lancaster and then on to preston</s> i was little more than a lad andrew but even to me it seemed madnessthus to march into england with only two thousand men</s>  of these twelvehundred were foot commanded by brigadier mackintosh the others werehorse</s>  there were two troops of stanhopes dragoons quartered in prestonbut these retired when we neared the town and we entered withoutopposition</s>  next day which was i remember the 10th of november thechevalier was proclaimed king and some country gentlemen with theirtenants came in and joined us</s> i suppose it would have come to the same thing in the end but neverwere things so badly managed as they were by mr</s>  forster</s> preston was a strong natural position an enemy coming from the southcould only reach it by crossing a narrow bridge over the river ribble amile and a half away and this could have been held by a company againstan army</s>  from the bridge to the town the road was so narrow that inseveral places two men could not ride abreast</s>  it ran between two highand steep banks and it was here that cromwell was nearly killed when heattacked charless troops</s> well all these places where we might certainly have defendedourselves were neglected and we were all kept in the town where weformed four main posts</s>  one was in the churchyard and this was commandedby brigadier mackintosh</s>  in support of this was the volunteer horse underderwentwater and the three other lords</s>  lord charles murray was incommand at a barricade at a little distance from the churchyard</s>  colonelmackintosh had charge of a post at a windmill and the fourth was in thecentre of the town</s> lord derwentwater was a poor general but he was a brave man</s>  he and histwo brothers the ratcliffs rode about everywhere setting an example ofcoolness animating the soldiers and seeing to the work on the barriers</s> two days after we reached the town we heard that general wilde wasapproaching</s>  colonel farquharson was sent forward with a portion ofmackintoshs battalion to hold the bridge and the pass but mr</s>  forsterwho went out on horseback no sooner saw the enemy approaching than hegave orders to farquharson and his men to retreat to the town</s>  if i hadbeen in farquharsons place i would have put a bullet through thecowards head and would have defended the bridge till the last</s> after that everything was confusion the highlanders came back into thetown furious and disheartened</s>  the garrison prepared to receive theenemy</s>  mr</s>  forster was seen no more and in fact he went straight back tothe house where he was lodging and took his bed where he remained tillall was over</s>  the enemy came on slowly</s>  they could not understand whystrong posts should be left undefended and feared falling in anambuscade</s>  i was at the post commanded by brigadier mackintosh</s>  i hadjoined a company commanded by leslie of glenlyon who had brought withhim some twenty men and had made up his company with men who likemyself came up without a leader</s>  his company was attached tomackintoshs regiment</s> presently the english came in sight and as soon as they ascertainedthat we were still there which they had begun to doubt they attackedus</s>  we beat them back handsomely and derwentwater with his cavalrycharged their dragoons so fiercely that he drove them out of the town</s>  itwas late in the afternoon when the fight began and all night thestruggle went on</s>  at each of our posts we beat them back over and overagain</s>  the town was on fire in half a dozen places but luckily the nightwas still and the flames did not spread</s>  we knew that it was a hopelessfight we were making for from some prisoners we learned that threeregiments of dragoons were also coming up against us and had alreadyarrived at clitheroe</s>  from some inhabitants i suppose the enemy learnedthat the street leading to wigan had nor been barricaded and lordforrester brought up prestons regiment by this way and suddenly fell onthe flank of our barrier</s>  it was a tough fight but we held our own tillthe news came that forster had agreed to capitulate</s> i dont say that our case wasnt hopeless</s>  we were outnumbered and hadno leader sooner or later we must have been overpowered</s>  still nocapitulation should have been made except on the terms of mercy to allconcerned</s>  but forster no doubt felt safe about himself and that was allhe cared for and the end showed that he knew what he was about forwhile all the brave young noblemen and numbers of others were eitherexecuted or punished in other ways forster who had been the leadingspirit who had persuaded them to rise and led them into this strait wasafter a short imprisonment suffered to go free</s>  i tell you brotherandrew if i were to meet him now even if it were in a church i woulddrive my dagger into his heart</s> however there we were</s>  so furious were we that it was with difficultythe officers could prevent us from sallying out sword in hand and tryingto cut our way through the enemy</s>  as to forster if he had appeared inthe streets he would have been hewn to pieces</s>  however it was useless toresist now the english troops marched in and we laid down our arms andour battalions marched into a church and were guarded as prisoners</s>  itwas not a great army they had taken for there were but one thousand fourhundred and ninety captured including noblemen gentlemen and officers</s> many of us were wounded more or less</s>  i had got a slice on the shoulderfrom a dragoons sword</s>  this i gained when rushing out to rescue lesliewho had been knocked down and would have been slain by three dragoonshad i not stood over him till some of our men rushed out and carried himin</s>  he was not badly hurt the sword having turned as it cut through hisbonnet</s>  my action won his regard and from that time until a month sincewe have never been separated</s>  under a strong escort of soldiers we weremarched south</s>  in most places the country people mocked us as we passedbut here and there we saw among the crowds who gathered in the streets ofthe towns through which we passed faces which we passed faces whichexpressed pity and sympathywe were not badly treated on the march by our guard and had little tocomplain of</s>  when we reached barnet we fell out as usual when the marchwas over and i went up to the door of a house and asked a woman wholooked pityingly at us for a drink of water</s>  she brought me some andwhile i drank she saidwe are catholics and well wishers of the chevalier if you can manageto slip in here after it is dark we will furnish you with a disguise andwill direct you to friends who will pass you on until you can escape</s> can you give me disguises for two</s>  i asked</s>  i will not go without mycaptain</s> yes she said for two but no more</s> i will steal away after dark i said as i gave her back the jug</s> i told leslie what had happened and he agreed to join me in time toescape for there was no saying what fate might befall us in london andindeed the very next morning severities commenced the whole of thetroops being obliged to suffer the indignity of having their arms tiedbehind them and so being marched into london</s> after it was dark leslie and i managed to steal away from our guardswho were not very watchful for our uniform would at once have betrayedus and the country people would have seized and handed us over</s>  thewoman was on the watch and as soon as we neared the door she opened it</s> her husband was with her and received us kindly</s>  he at once furnished uswith the attire of two countrymen and letting us out by a back waystarted with us across the country</s> after walking twenty miles he brought us to the house of anotheradherent of the chevalier where we remained all day</s>  so we were passedon until we reached the coast where we lay hid for some days until anarrangement was made with the captain of a fishing boat to take us tosea and either to land us at calais or to put us on board a frenchfishing boat</s>  so we got over without trouble</s> long before that as you know the business had virtually come to an endhere</s>  the earl of mars army lay week after week at perth till at lastit met the enemy under argyle at sheriffmuir</s> you know how that went</s>  the highland clans in the right and centrecarried all before them and drove the enemy from the field but on theleft they beat us badly</s>  so both parties claimed the victory</s>  butvictory or defeat it was fatal to the cause of the chevalier</s>  half thehighland clans went off to their homes that night and mar had to fallback to perth</s> well that was really the end of it</s>  the chevalier landed and for awhile our hopes rose</s>  he did nothing and our hopes fell</s>  at last he tookship and went away and the affair was over except for the hangings andslaughterings</s> leslie like most of the scottish gentlemen who succeeded in reachingfrance took service with the french king and of course i did thesame</s>  it would have done your heart good to see how the scottishregiments fought on many a field the very best troops of france werenever before us and many a tough field was decided by our charge</s>  lesliewas a cornet</s>  he was about my age and you know i was but twenty whensheriffmuir was fought</s>  he rose to be a colonel and would have given mea pair of colours over and over again if i would have taken them but ifelt more comfortable among our troopers than i should have done amongthe officers who were almost all men of good highland family so iremained leslies right hand</s> a braver soldier never swung a leg over saddle but he was always insome love affair or another</s>  why he didnt marry i couldnt make out</s>  isuppose he could never stick long enough to one woman</s>  however some fouryears ago he got into an affair more serious than any he had been inbefore and this time he stuck to it in right earnest</s>  of course she wasprecisely one of the women he oughtnt to have fallen in love withthough i for one couldnt blame him for a prettier creature wasnt to befound in france</s>  unfortunately she was the only daughter of the marquisde recambours one of the wealthiest and most powerful of french noblesand there was no more chance of his giving his consent to her throwingherself away upon a scottish soldier of fortune than to her going into anunnery less in fact</s>  however she was as much in love with leslie ashe was with her and so they got secretly married</s>  two years ago thischild was born but she managed somehow to keep it from her father whowas all this time urging her to marry the duke de chateaurouge</s> at last as ill luck would have it he shut her up in a convent just aweek before she had arranged to fly with leslie to germany where heintended to take service until her father came round</s>  leslie would havegot her out somehow but his regiment was ordered to the frontier and itwas eighteen months before we returned to paris where the child had beenin keeping with some people with whom he had placed it</s>  the very eveningof his return i was cleaning his arms when he rushed into the room</s> all is discovered he said here is my signet ring go at once andget the child and make your way with it to scotland take all the moneyin the escritoire quick</s> i heard feet approaching and dashed to the bureau and transferred thebag of louis there to my pocket</s>  an official with two followers entered</s> colonel leslie he said it is my duty to arrest you by order of hisgracious majesty and he held out an order signed by the king</s> i am unconscious of having done any wrong sir to his majesty whom ihave served for the last sixteen years</s>  however it is not for me todispute his orders thereupon he unbuckled his sword and handed it tothe officers</s>  you will look after the things till i return malcolm</s>  asi am sure i can clear myself of any charge that may be brought againstme i trust to be speedily back again</s> your trooper need not trouble himself the officer said the officialwith me will take charge of everything and will at once affix my seal toall your effects</s> i went down stairs and saw the colonel enter a carriage with the twoofficials then i went straight to the major</s>  colonel leslie has beenarrested sir on what charge i know not</s>  he has intrusted a commissionto me</s>  therefore if you find i am absent from parade in the morning youwill understand i am carrying out his orders</s> the major was thunderstruck at the news but told me to do as thecolonel had ordered me whatever it might be</s>  i mounted the colonelshorse at once and rode to the house where the child was in keeping</s>  thepeople knew me well as i had often been there with messages from thecolonel</s>  when i showed them the signet ring and told them that i hadorders to take the child to his father they made no opposition</s>  i said iwould return for him as soon as it was dusk</s>  i then went and purchased asuit of civilian clothes and returning to the house attired myself inthese and taking the child on the saddle before me rode for thefrontier</s> following unfrequented roads travelling only at night and passing aday in a wood i passed the frontier unmolested and made my way toostend where i sold the horse and took passage in the first ship sailingfor leith</s>  i arrived there two days ago and have walked here with anoccasional lift in a cart and here i am brother andrew to ask you forhospitality for a while for myself and leslies boy</s>  i have a hundredlouis but these of course belong to the child</s>  as for myself iconfess i have nothing saving has never been in my line</s> you are heartily welcome malcolm as long as you choose to stop but itrust that ere long you will hear of colonel leslie</s> i trust so malcolm said but if you knew the court of france as wellas i do you would not feel very sanguine about it</s>  it is easier to getinto a prison than out of one</s> but the colonel has committed no crime</s>  the bailie said</s> his chance would be a great deal better if he had malcolm laughed</s>  acolonel of one of his majestys scottish regiments can do a good deal inthe way of crime without much harm befalling him but when it comes tomarrying the daughter of a nobleman who is a great personage at courtwithout his consent it is a different affair altogether i can tell you</s> leslie has powerful friends and his brother officers will do what theycan for him but i can tell you services at the court of france go forvery little</s>  influence is everything and as the nobleman the marquisintended to be the husband of his daughter is also a great personage atcourt and a friend of louiss there is no saying how serious a matterthey may make of it</s>  men have been kept prisoners for life for a far lessserious business than this</s> but supposing he is released does he know where to communicate withyou</s> i am afraid he doesnt malcolm said ruefully</s>  he knows that i comefrom glasgow but that is all</s>  still when he is freed no doubt he willcome over himself to look for his son and i am sure to hear of his beinghere</s> you might do and you might not the bailie said</s>  still we must hopefor the best malcolm</s>  at any rate i am in no haste for the colonel tocome</s>  now i have got you home again after all these years i do not wishto lose you again in a hurry</s> malcolm only remained for a few weeks at his brothers house</s>  therestraint of life at the bailies was too much for him</s>  andrews was awell ordered household</s>  the bailie was methodical and regular a leadingfigure in the kirk far stricter than were most men of his time as toundue consumption of liquor strong in exhortation in season and out ofseason</s>  his wife was kindly but precise and as outspoken as andrewhimself</s>  for the first day or two the real affection which andrew had forhis younger brother and the pleasure he felt at his return shieldedmalcolm from comment or rebuke but after the very first day the bailieswife had declared to herself that it was impossible that malcolm couldlong remain an inmate of the house</s>  she was not inhospitable and wouldhave made great sacrifices in some directions for the long missingbrother of her husband but his conduct outraged all the best feelings ofa good scotch housewife</s> even on that first day he did not come punctually to his meals</s>  he wasaway about the town looking up old acquaintance came in at dinner andagain at supper after the meal had already begun and dropped into hisplace and began to eat without saying a word of grace</s>  he stamped aboutthe house as if he had cavalry spurs still on his heels talked in avoice that could be heard from attic to basement used french and flemishoaths which horrified the good lady although she did not understandthem smoked at all hours of the day whereas andrew always confinedhimself to his after supper pipe and in spite of his assertions on theprevious evening consumed an amount of liquor which horrified the goodwoman</s> at his meals he talked loudly kept the two apprentices in a titter withhis stories of campaigning spoke slightingly of the city authoritiesand joked the bailie with a freedom and roughness which scandalized her</s> andrew was slow to notice the incongruity of his brothers demeanour andbearing with the atmosphere of the house although he soon became dimlyconscious that there was a jarring element in the air</s>  at the end of aweek malcolm broached the subject to him</s> andrew he said you are a good fellow though you are a bailie and anelder of the kirk and i thank you for the hearty welcome you have givenme and for your invitation to stay for a long time with you but it willnot do</s>  janet is a good woman and a kindly but i can see that i keep herperpetually on thorns</s>  in good truth fifteen years of campaigning arebut an indifferent preparation for a man as an inmate of a respectablehousehold</s>  i did not quite know myself how thoroughly i had become adevil may care trooper until i came back to my old life here</s>  the ways ofyour house would soon be as intolerable to me as my ways are to your goodwife and therefore it is better by far that before any words have passedbetween you and me and while we are as good friends as on the eveningwhen i returned i should get out of this</s>  i met an old friend today oneof the lads who went with me from glasgow to join the earl of mar atperth</s>  he is well to do now and trades in cattle taking them in drovesdown into england</s>  for the sake of old times he has offered meemployment and methinks it will suit me as well as any other</s> but you cannot surely be going as a drover malcolm</s> why not</s>  the life is as good as any other</s>  i would not sit down afterthese years of roving to an indoor life</s>  i must either do that or crossthe water again and take service abroad</s>  i am only six and thirty yetand am good for another fifteen years of soldiering and right gladlywould i go back if leslie were again at the head of his regiment but ihave been spoiled by him</s>  he ever treated me as a companion and as afriend rather than as a trooper in his regiment and i should miss himsorely did i enter any other service</s>  then too i would fain be here tobe ready to join him again if he sends for me or comes and i should wishto keep an eye always on his boy</s>  you will continue to take charge ofhim wont you andrew</s>  he is still a little strange but he takes toelspeth and will give little trouble when he once learns the language</s> i dont like it at all malcolm the bailie said</s> no andrew but you must feel it is best</s>  i doubt not that ere this yourwife has told you her troubles concerning me</s> as the bailie on the preceding night had listened to a long string ofcomplaints and remonstrances on the part of his wife as to his brothersgeneral conduct he could not deny the truth of malcolms supposition</s> just so andrew malcolm went on i knew that it must be so</s>  mistressjanet has kept her lips closed firm to me but i could see how difficultit was for her sometimes to do so</s>  it could not be otherwise</s>  i am asmuch out of place here as a wolf in a sheepfold</s>  as to the droving ishall not mention to all i meet that i am brother to one of the bailiesof glasgow</s>  i shall like the life</s>  the rough pony i shall ride willdiffer in his paces from my old charger but at least it will be life inthe saddle</s>  i shall be earning an honest living if i take more than isgood for me i may get a broken head and none be the wiser whereas if iremain here and fall foul of the city watch it would be grief and painfor you</s> the bailie was silenced</s>  he had already begun to perceive that malcolmsways and manners were incompatible with the peace and quiet of arespectable household and that janets complaints were not altogetherunreasonable</s>  he had seen many of his acquaintances lift their eyebrowsin disapprobation at the roystering talk of his brother and had foreseenthat it was probable trouble would come</s> at the same rime he felt a repugnance to the thought that after so manyyears of absence his brother should so soon quit his house</s>  it seemed areflection alike on his affection and hospitality</s> you will take charge of the child wont you</s>  malcolm pleaded</s>  thereis a purse of a hundred louis which will i should say pay for anyexpense to which he may put you for some years</s> as if i would take the bairns money</s>  andrew exclaimed angrily</s>  whatdo you take me for malcolm</s>  assuredly i will take the child</s>  janet and ihave no bairn of our own and its good for a house to have a child init</s>  i look upon it as if it were yours for it is like enough you willnever hear of its father again</s>  it will have a hearty welcome</s>  it is abright little fellow and in time i doubt not that janet will takegreatly to it</s>  the charge of a child is a serious matter and we cannothope that we shall not have trouble with it but there is trouble in allthings</s>  at any rate malcolm we will do our best and if at the end of ayear i find that janet has not taken to it we will see about some otherarrangement</s>  and malcolm i do trust that you will stay with us foranother week or two</s>  it would seem to me as if i had turned you out of myhouse were you to leave me so soon</s> so malcolm made a three weeks stay at his brothers and then startedupon his new occupation of driving highland cattle down into lancashire</s> once every two or three months he came to glasgow for a week or twobetween his trips</s>  in spite of andrews entreaties he refused on theseoccasions to take up his abode with him but took a lodging not far offcoming in the evening for an hour to smoke a pipe with his brother andnever failing of a morning to come in and take the child for a long walkwith him carrying him upon his shoulder and keeping up a steady talkwith him in his native french which he was anxious that the boy shouldnor forget as at some time or other he might again return to france</s> some weeks after malcolms return to scotland he wrote to colonelleslie briefly giving his address at glasgow but making no allusion tothe child as if the colonel were still in prison the letter would besure to be opened by the authorities</s>  he also wrote to the major givinghim his address and begging him to communicate it to colonel lesliewhenever he should see him that done there was nothing for it but towait quietly</s>  the post was so uncertain in those days that he had butslight hope that either of his letters would ever reach theirdestination</s>  no answer came to either of his letters</s> four years later malcolm went over to paris and cautiously madeinquiries but no one had heard anything of colonel leslie from the dayhe had been arrested</s>  the regiment was away fighting in the lowcountries and the only thing malcolm could do was to call upon thepeople who had had charge of the child to give them his address in casethe colonel should ever appear to inquire of them</s>  he found however thehouse tenanted by other people</s>  he learned that the last occupants hadleft years before</s>  the neighbors remembered that one morning early someofficers of the law had come to the house and the man had been seizedand carried away</s>  he had been released some months later only to findthat his wife had died of grief and anxiety and he had then sold off hisgoods and gone no one knew whither</s>  malcolm therefore returned toglasgow with the feeling that he had gained nothing by his journey</s> chapter ii the jacobite agent</s> so twelve years passed</s>  ronald leslie grew up a sturdy lad full of funand mischief in spite of the sober atmosphere of the bailies house andneither flogging at school nor lecturing at home appeared to have theslightest effect in reducing him to that state of sober tranquillitywhich was in mrs</s>  andersons eyes the thing to be most desired in boys</s> andrew was less deeply shocked than his wife at the discovery of ronaldsvarious delinquencies but his sense of order and punctuality wasconstantly outraged</s>  he was however really fond of the lad and evenmrs</s>  anderson greatly as the boys ways constantly disturbed and ruffledher was at heart as fond of him as was her husband</s>  she considered andnot altogether wrongly that his wilderness as she called it was in noslight degree due to his association with her husbands brother</s> ronald looked forward to the periodical visits of the drover with intenselonging</s>  he was sure of a sympathetic listener in malcolm who listenedwith approval to the tales of the various scrapes into which he had gotsince his last visit of how instead of going to school he had playedtruant and with another boy his own age had embarked in a fishermansboat and gone down the river and had not been able to get back until nextday how he had played tricks upon his dominie and had conquered insingle combat the son of councillor duff the butcher who had spokenscoffing words at the stuarts</s>  malcolm was in fact delighted to findthat in spite of repression and lectures his young charge was growing upa lad of spirit</s>  he still hoped that some day leslie might return and heknew how horrified he would be were he to find that his son was becominga smug and well conducted citizen</s>  no small portion of his time on eachof his visits to glasgow malcolm spent in training the boy in the use ofarms</s> your father was a gentleman he would say to him and it is fittingthat you should know how to handle a gentlemans arms</s>  clubs are wellenough for citizens apprentices but i would have you handle rapier andbroadsword as well as any of the young lairds</s>  when you get old enoughronald you and i will cross the seas and together we will try and getto the bottom of the mystery of your fathers fate and if we find thatthe worst has come to the worst we will seek our your mother</s>  she willmost likely have married again</s>  they will be sure to have forced her intoit but even if she dare not acknowledge you as her son her influencemay obtain for you a commission in one of the kings regiments and evenif they think im too old for a trooper i will go as your follower</s>  thereare plenty of occasions at the court of france when a sharp sword and astout arm even if it be somewhat stiffened by age can do good service</s> the lessons began as soon as ronald was old enough to hold a light bladeand as between the pauses of exercise malcolm was always ready to tellstories of his adventures in the wars of france the days were full ofdelight to ronald</s>  when the latter reached the age of fourteen malcolmwas not satisfied with the amount of proficiency which the lad was ableto gain during his occasional visits and therefore took him for furtherinstruction to a comrade who had like himself served in france and hadreturned and settled down in glasgow where he opened a fencing schoolhaving been a maitre darmes among the scotch regiments</s> the arrangement was however kept a profound secret from andrew and hiswife but on half holidays and on any other days when he could manage toslip away for an hour ronald went to his instructor and worked hard andsteadily with the rapier</s>  had mrs</s>  anderson had an idea of the manner inwhich he spent his time she would have been horrified and wouldcertainly have spared her encomiums on his improved conduct and theabsence of the unsatisfactory reports which had before been so common</s> the cloud of uncertainty which hung over his fathers fate could not buthave an influence upon the boys character and the happy carelessnessand gaiety which were its natural characteristics were modified by thethought that his father might be languishing in a dungeon</s>  sometimes hewould refuse to accompany his school fellows on their rambles or fishingexpeditions and would sit for hours thinking over all sorts of wildplans by which he might penetrate to him and aid him to escape</s>  he wasnever tired of questioning malcolm anderson as to the prisons in whichif still alive his father would be likely to be confined</s>  he would askas to their appearance the height of their walls whether they weremoated or not and whether other houses abutted closely upon them</s>  oneday malcolm asked him the reason of these questions and he replied ofcourse i want to see how it will be possible to get my father out</s>  andalthough malcolm tried to impress upon him that it would be an almostimpossible task even to discover in which prison his father was kept hewould not allow himself to be discouraged</s> there must be some way of finding out malcolm</s>  you tell me thatprisoners are not even known by their name to the warders but only undera number</s>  still someone must know  there must be lists kept of those inprison and i shall trust to my mother to find out for me</s>  a great ladyas she is must be able to get at people if she sets about it and ascertainly she must have loved my father very very much or she neverwould have married him secretly and got into such trouble for it</s>  i amsure she will do her best when she finds that you and i have come over toget him out</s>  when we know that i think we ought to be able to manage</s> you could get employment as a warder or i could go disguised as a womanor as a priest or somehow</s>  i feel sure we shall succeed if we do butfind out that he is alive and where he is</s> malcolm knew too much about the strong and well guarded prisons of franceto share in the boys sanguine hopes but he did not try to discouragehim</s>  he thought that with such an object in life before him the boy woulddevote himself all the more eagerly to exercises which would strengthenhis arm increase his skill with weapons and render him a brave andgallant officer and in this he was right</s>  as the time went on ronaldbecame more and more serious</s>  he took no part whatever in the school boygames and frolics in which he had been once a leader</s>  he worked hard athis school tasks the sooner to be done with them and above all devotedhimself to acquiring a mastery of the sword with a perseverance andenthusiasm which quite surprised his instructor</s> i tell you malcolm man he said one day to his old comrade afterronald had been for upwards of two years his pupil if i had known whenyou first asked me to teach the lad to handle a sword how much of mytime he was going to occupy i should have laughed in your face for tentimes the sum you agreed to pay me would not have been enough buthaving begun it for your sake i have gone on for the lads</s>  it has beena pleasure to teach him so eager was he to learn  so ready to workheart and soul to improve</s>  the boys wrist is as strong as mine and hiseye as quick</s>  i have long since taught him all i know and it is practicenow and not teaching that we have every day</s>  i tell you i have work tohold my own with him he knows every trick and turn as well as i do andis quicker with his lunge and riposte</s>  were it not that i have my extralength of arm in my favour i could not hold my own</s>  as you know i havemany of the officers of the garrison among my pupils and some of themhave learned in good schools but there is not one of them could defendhimself for a minute against that boy</s>  if it were not that the matter hasto be kept secret i would set him in front of some of them and you wouldsee what short work he would make of them</s>  have you heard the rumoursmalcolm that the young chevalier is likely to follow the example of hisfather thirty years back and to make a landing in scotland</s> i have heard some such rumours malcolm replied though whether therebe aught in them i know not</s>  i hope that if he does so he will at anyrate follow the example of his father no further</s>  as you know i hold tothe stuarts but i must own they are but poor hands at fighting</s>  charlesthe first ruined his cause james the second threw away the crown ofireland by galloping away from the battle of the boyne the chevaliershowed here in 15 that he was no leader of men and unless this lad ismade of very different stuff to his forefathers he had best stay infrance</s> but if he should come malcolm i suppose you will join him</s>  i am afraidi shall be fool enough to do so even with my fifty years on my head</s>  andyou</s> i suppose i shall be a fool too malcolm said</s>  the stuarts are scotchyou see and with all their faults i would rather a thousand times have ascottish king than these germans who govern us from london</s>  if theenglish like them let them keep them and let us have a king of our own</s> however nought may come of it it may be but a rumour</s>  it is a cardwhich louis has threatened to play a score of times whenever he wishesto annoy england</s>  it is more than likely that it will come to nought asit has so often done before</s> but they tell me that there are agents travelling about among thehighland clans and that this time something is really to be done</s> they have said so over and over again and nothing has come of it</s>  formy part i dont care which way it goes</s>  after the muddle that was madeof it thirty years ago it does not seem to me more likely that we shallget rid of the hanoverians now</s>  besides the hangings and slaughteringsthen would i should think make the nobles and the heads of clans thinktwice ere they risked everything again</s> that is true but when mens blood is up they do not count the costbesides the highland clans are always ready to fight</s>  if prince charlescomes you will see there will not be much hanging back whatever theconsequences may be</s>  well you and i have not much to lose except ourlives</s> that is true enough old friend and i would rather die that way thanany other</s>  still to tell you the truth i would rather keep my head onmy shoulders for a few years if i can</s> well nothing may come of it but if it does i shall strike a blow againfor the old cause</s> at home ronald heard nothing but expressions of loyalty to the crown</s>  themere fact that the highlanders espoused the cause of the stuarts wassufficient in itself to make the lowlanders take the opposite side</s>  thereligious feeling which had always counted for so much in the lowlandsand had caused scotland to side with the parliament against king charleshad not lost its force</s>  the leanings of the stuarts were it was knownstill strongly in favour of the catholic religion and although princecharles edward was reported to be more protestant in feelings than therest of his race this was not sufficient to counterbalance the effect ofthe hereditary catholic tendency</s>  otherwise there was no feeling ofactive loyalty towards the reigning king in scotland</s>  the first andsecond georges had none of the attributes which attract loyal affection</s> the first could with difficulty speak the language of the people overwhom he ruled</s>  their feelings and sympathies were hanoverian rather thanenglish and all court favours were bestowed as fast as possible upontheir countrymen</s>  they had neither the bearing nor manner which menassociate with royalty nor the graces and power of attraction whichdistinguished the stuarts</s>  commonplace and homely in manner in figureand in bearing they were not men whom their fellows could look up to orrespect their very vices were coarse and the hanoverian men and womenthey gathered round them were hated by the english people</s> thus neither in england nor scotland was there any warm feeling ofloyalty for the reigning house and though it was possible that but fewwould adventure life and property in the cause of the stuarts it wasequally certain that outside the army there were still fewer who woulddraw sword for the hanoverian king</s>  among the people of the lowlandcities of scotland the loyalty which existed was religious rather thancivil and rested upon the fact that their forefathers had fought againstthe stuarts while the highlanders had always supported their cause</s> thus although in the household and in kirk ronald had heard king georgeprayed for regularly he had heard no word concerning him calculated towaken a boyish feeling of loyalty still less of enthusiasm</s>  upon theother hand he knew that his father had fought and suffered for thestuarts and was an exile in their cause and that hanoverians had handedover the estate of which he himself would now be the heir to one of theiradherents</s> it is no use talking of these matters to andrew malcolm impressed uponhim it would do no good</s>  when he was a young man he took the side ofthe hanoverians and he wont change now while did mistress janet guessthat your heart was with the stuarts she would say that i was ruiningyou and should bring you to a gallows</s>  she is not fond of me now thoughshe does her best to be civil to her husbands brother but did she knowthat you had become a jacobite like enough she would move andrew to puta stop to your being with me and there would be all sorts of trouble</s> but they could nor prevent my being with you ronald said indignantly</s> my father gave me into your charge not into theirs</s> thats true enough laddie but it is they who have cared for you andbrought you up</s>  when you are a man you can no doubt go which way itpleases you but till then you owe your duty and respect to them and notto me who have done nought for you but just carry you over here in mycloak</s> i know they have done everything for me ronald said penitently</s>  theyhave been very good and kind and i love them both but for all that itis only natural that my father should be first and that my heart shouldbe in the cause that he fought for</s> that is right enough ronald and i would not have it otherwise and ihave striven to do my best to make you as he would like to see you</s>  didhe never come back again i should be sorry indeed to see colonel lesliesson growing up a glasgow tradesman as my brother no doubt intends you tobe for i know he has long since given up any thought of hearing fromyour father but in that you and i will have a say when the time comes</s> until then you must treat andrew as your natural guardian and there isno need to anger him by letting him know that your heart is with the kingover the water any more than that you can wield a sword like agentleman</s>  let us have peace as long as we can</s>  you are getting on forsixteen now another two years and we will think about going to paristogether</s>  i am off again tomorrow ronald it will not be a long tripthis time but maybe before i get back we shall have news from francewhich will set the land on fire</s> a short time after this conversation as ronald on his return fromcollege for he was now entered at the university passed through theshop the bailie was in conversation with one of the city magistratesand ronald caught the wordshe is somewhere in the city</s>  he came down from the highlands where hehas been going to and fro two days since</s>
 i have a warrant out againsthim and the constables are on the lookout</s>  i hope to have him in jailbefore tonight</s>  these pestilent rogues are a curse to the land though icannot think the clans would be fools enough to rise again even thoughcharles stuart did come</s> ronald went straight up to his room and for a few minutes sat inthought</s>  the man of whom they spoke was doubtless an emissary of princecharles and his arrest might have serious consequences perhaps bringruin on all with whom he had been in communication</s>  who he was or what hewas like ronald knew not but he determined at any rate to endeavour todefeat the intentions of the magistrate to lay hands on him</s>  accordinglya few minutes later while the magistrate was still talking with andrewhe again went out</s> ronald waited about outside the door till he left and then followed himat a short distance</s>  the magistrate spoke to several acquaintances on theway and then went to the council chamber</s>  waiting outside ronald sawtwo or three of the magistrates enter</s>  an hour later the magistrate hewas watching came out but he had gone but a few paces when a manhurrying up approached him</s>  they talked earnestly for a minute or two</s> the magistrate then reentered the building remained there a fewminutes and then joined the man who was waiting outside</s>  ronald hadstolen up and taken his stand close by</s> it is all arranged the magistrate said as soon as night has fallen aparty will go down surround the house and arrest him</s>  it is better notto do it in daylight</s>  i shall lead the party which will come round to myhouse so if the men you have left on watch bring you news that he haschanged his hiding place let me know at once</s> the magistrate walked on</s>  ronald stood irresolute</s>  he had obtained noclue as to the residence of the person of whom they were in search andafter a moments thought he determined to keep an eye upon the constablewho would most likely join his comrade on the watch</s>  this however hedid not do immediately</s>  he had probably been for some time at work andnow took the opportunity of going home for a meal for he at once madehis way to a quiet part of the city and entered a small house</s> it was half an hour before he came out again and ronald fidgeted withimpatience for it was already growing dusk</s>  when he issued out ronaldsaw that he was armed with a heavy cudgel</s>  he walked quickly now andronald following at a distance passed nearly across the town and downa quiet street which terminated against the old wall running from thecastle port to a small tower</s>  when he got near the bottom of the street aman came out from an archway and the two spoke together</s>  from theirgestures ronald felt sure that it was the last house on the left handside of the street that was being watched</s>  he had not ventured to followfar down the street for as there was no thoroughfare he would at once beregarded with suspicion</s>  the question now was how to warn the man of hisdanger</s>  he knew several men were on the watch and as only one was in thestreet doubtless the others were behind the house</s>  if anything was to bedone there was no time to be lost for the darkness was fast closing in</s> after a minutes thought he went quickly up the street and then startedat a run and then came down upon a place where he could ascend the wallwhich was at many points in bad repair</s>  with some difficulty he climbedup and found that he was exactly opposite the house he wished to reach</s> it was dark now</s>  even in the principal streets the town was only lit byoil lamps here and there and there was no attempt at illumination in thequiet quarters persons who went abroad after nightfall always carrying alantern with them</s>  there was still sufficient light to show ronald thatthe house stood at a distance of some fourteen feet from the wall</s>  theroof sloped too steeply for him to maintain his holding upon it buthalfway along the house was a dormer window about three feet above thegutter</s>  it was unglazed and doubtless gave light to a granary or storeroom</s> ronald saw that his only chance was to alight on the roof close enough tothis window to be able to grasp the woodwork</s>  at any other moment hewould have hesitated before attempting such a leap</s>  the wall was only afew feet wide and he could therefore get but little run for a spring</s> his blood was however up and having taken his resolution he did nothesitate</s>  drawing back as far as he could he took three steps and thensprang for the window</s>  its sill was some three feet higher than the edgeof the wall from which he sprang</s> the leap was successful his feet struck just upon the gutter and theimpetus threw forward his body and his hands grasped the woodwork of thewindow</s>  in a moment he had dragged himself inside</s>  it was quite darkwithin the room</s>  he moved carefully for the floor was piled with disusedfurniture boxes sacking and rubbish</s>  he was some time finding thedoor but although he moved as carefully as he could he knocked over aheavy chest which was placed on a rickety chair the two falling with acrash on the floor</s>  at last he found the door and opened it</s>  as he did soa light met his eyes and he saw ascending the staircase a man with adrawn sword and a woman holding a light above her head followingclosely</s>  the man uttered an exclamation on seeing ronald appear</s> a thief</s>  he said</s>  surrender or i will run you through at once</s> i am no thief ronald replied</s>  my name is ronald leslie and i am astudent at the university</s>  i have come here to warn someone whom i knownot in this house that it is watched and that in a few minutes at theoutside a band of the city watch will be here to capture him</s> the man dropped the point of his sword and taking the light from thewoman held it closer to ronalds face</s> how came you here</s>  he asked</s>  how did you learn this news</s> the house is watched both sides below ronald said and i leapt fromthe wall through the dormer window</s>  i heard a magistrate arranging withone of the constables for a capture and gathered that he of whom theywere in search was a jacobite and as i come of a stock which has alwaysbeen faithful to the stuarts i hastened to warn him</s> the woman uttered a cry of alarm</s> i thank you with all my heart young sir</s>  i am he for whom they are insearch and if i get free you will render a service indeed to our causebut there is no time to talk now if what you tell me be true</s>  you saythe house is watched from both sides</s> yes there are two men in the lane below one or more i know not howmany behind</s> there is no escape behind the man said the walls are high and otherhouses abut upon them</s>  i will sally out and fight through the men infront</s> i can handle the sword ronald put in and if you will provide me witha weapon i will do my best by your side</s> you are a brave lad the man said and i accept your aid</s> he led the way down stairs and entered a room took down a sword fromover the fireplace and gave it to ronald</s> as he took it in his hand there was a loud knocking at the door</s> too late</s>  the man exclaimed</s>  quick the light mary</s>  at any rate imust burn my papers</s> he drew some letters from his pocket lit them at the lamp and threwthem on the hearth then opening a cabinet he drew forth a number ofother papers and crumpling them up added them to the blaze</s> thank god that is safe</s>  he said the worst evil is averted</s> can you not escape by the way by which i came hither</s>  ronald said</s>  thedistance is too great to leap but if you have got a plank or can pullup a board from the floor you could put it across to the wall and makeyour escape that way</s>  i will try to hold the stairs till you are away</s> i will try at least the man said</s>  mary bring the light and aid mewhile our brave friend does his best to give us time</s> so saying he sprang upstairs while ronald made his way down to the door</s> who is making such a noise at the door of a quiet house at this time ofnight</s>  he shouted</s> open in the kings name was the reply we have a warrant to arrestone who is concealed here</s> there is no one concealed here ronald replied and i doubt that youare as you say officers of the peace but if so pass your warrantthrough the grill and if it be signed and in due form i will open toyou</s> i will show my warrant when need be the voice answered</s>  once moreopen the door or we will break it in</s> do it at your peril ronald replied</s>  how can i tell you are notthieves who seek to ransack the house and that your warrant is apretence</s>  i warn you that the first who enters i will run him through thebody</s> the reply was a shower of blows on the door and a similar attack wasbegun by a party behind the house</s>  the door was strong and after aminute or two the hammering ceased and then there was a creakingstraining noise and ronald knew they were applying a crowbar to force itopen</s>  he retreated to a landing halfway up the stairs placed a lampbehind him so that it would show its light full on the faces of thoseascending the stairs and waited</s>  a minute later there was a crash thelock had yielded but the bar still held the door in its place</s>  then theblows redoubled mingled with the crashing of wood then there was thesound of a heavy fall and a body of men burst in</s> there was a rush at the stairs but the foremost halted at the sight ofronald with his drawn sword</s> keep back he shouted or beware</s>  the watch will be here in a fewminutes and then you will all be laid by the heels</s> fools</s>  we are the watch one of the men exclaimed and dashing up thestairs aimed a blow at ronald</s>  he guarded it and ran the man through theshoulder</s>  he dropped his sword and fell back with a curse</s> at this moment the woman ran down stairs from above and nodded to ronaldto signify that the fugitive had escaped</s> you see i hold to my word ronald said in a loud voice</s>  if ye be thewatch which i doubt show me the warrant or if ye have one in authoritywith you let him proclaim himself</s> here is the warrant and here am i james mwhirtle a magistrate ofthis city</s> why did you not say so before</s>  ronald exclaimed lowering his sword</s> if it be truly the worshipful mr</s>  mwhirtle let him show himself forsurely i know him well having seen him often in the house of myguardian bailie anderson</s> mr</s>  mwhirtle who had been keeping well in the rear now came forward</s> it is himself</s>  ronald said</s>  why did you not say you were here at oncemr</s>  mwhirtle instead of setting your men to break down the door as ifthey were highland caterans on a foray</s> we bade you open in the kings name the magistrate said and youwithstood us and it will be hanging matter for you for you have aidedthe kings enemies</s> the kings enemies</s>  ronald said in a tone of surprise</s>  how can therebe any enemies of the king here seeing there are only myself and thegood woman up stairs</s>  you will find no others</s> search the house the magistrate said furiously and take thismalapert lad into custody on the charge of assisting the kings enemiesof impeding the course of justice of withstanding by force of arms theissue of a lawful writ and with grievously wounding one of the citywatch</s> ronald laughed</s> it is a grievous list worshipful sir but mark you as soon as youshowed your warrant and declared yourself i gave way to you</s>  i onlyresisted so long as it seemed to me you were evildoers breaking into apeaceful house</s> two of the watch remained as guard over ronald one of the otherssearched the house from top to bottom</s>  no signs of the fugitive werediscovered</s> he must be here somewhere the magistrate said since he was seen toenter and the house has been closely watched ever since</s>  see there area pile of ashes on the hearth as if papers had been recently burned</s> sound the floors and the walls</s> the investigation was particularly sharp in the attic for a board washere found to be loose and there were signs of its being recentlywrenched out of its place but as the room below was unceiled thisdiscovery led to nothing</s>  at last the magistrate was convinced that thefugitive was not concealed in the house and after placing his seals onthe doors of all the rooms and leaving four men in charge he left theplace ronald under the charge of four men accompanying him</s> on the arrival at the city tolbooth ronald was thrust into a cell andthere left until morning</s>  he was then brought before mr</s>  mwhirtle andtwo other of the city magistrates</s>  andrew anderson was in attendancehaving been notified the night before of what had befallen ronald</s>  thebailie and his wife had at first been unable to credit the news and wereconvinced that some mistake had been made</s>  andrew had tried to obtain hisrelease on his promise to bring him up in the morning but mr</s>  mwhirtleand his colleagues who had been hastily summoned together would nothear of it</s> its a case of treason man</s>  treason against his gracious majestyaiding and abetting one of the kings enemies to say nought of brawlingand assaulting the city watch</s> the woman found in the house had also been brought up but no precisecharge was made against her</s>  the court was crowded for andrew in hiswrath at being unable to obtain ronalds release had not been backwardin publishing his grievance and many of his neighbours were present tohear this strange charge against ronald leslie</s> the wounded constable and another first gave their evidence</s> i myself can confirm what has been said mr</s>  mwhirtle remarkedseeing that i was present with the watch to see the arrest of a personagainst whom a warrant had been issued</s> who is that person</s>  ronald asked</s>  seeing that i am charged with aidingand abetting his escape it seems to me that i have a right to know who heis</s> the magistrates looked astounded at the effrontery of the question butafter a moments consultation together mr</s>  mwhirtle said that in theinterest of justice it was unadvisable at the present moment to state thename of the person concerned</s> what have you to say prisoner to the charge made against you</s>  inconsideration of our good friend bailie anderson known to be a worthycitizen and loyal subject of his majesty we would be glad to hear whatyou have to say anent this charge</s> i have nothing to say ronald replied quietly</s>  being in the house whenit was attacked with as much noise as if a band of border ruffians wereat the gate i stood on the defence</s>  i demanded to see what warrant theyhad for forcing an entry and as they would show me none i did my bestto protect the house but the moment mr</s>  mwhirtle proclaimed who he wasi lowered my sword and gave them passage</s> there was a smile in the court at the boys coolness</s> but how came ye there young sir</s>  how came ye to be in the house at allif ye were there for a good motive</s> that i decline to say ronald answered</s>  it seems to me that any onemay be in a house by the consent of its owners without having to givehis reasons therefor</s> it will be the worse for you if you defy the court</s>  i ask you again howcame you there</s> i have no objection to tell you how i came there ronald said</s>  i waswalking on the old wall which as you know runs close by the housewhen i saw an ill looking loon hiding himself as if watching the houselooking behind i saw another ruffianly looking man there</s>  two gasps ofindignation were heard from the porch at the back of the court</s>  thinkingthat there was mischief on hand i leapt from the wall to the dormerwindow to warn the people of the house that there were ill doers who haddesigns upon the place and then remained to see what came of it</s>  that isthe simple fact</s> there was an exclamation of incredulity from the magistrates</s> if you doubt me ronald said you can send a man to the wall</s>  i feltmy feet loosen a tile and it slid down into the gutter</s> one of the magistrates gave an order and two of the watch left thecourt</s> and who did you find in the house</s> i found this good woman and sorely frightened she was when i told herwhat kind of folk were lurking outside</s> and was there anyone else there</s> there was a man there ronald said quietly and he seemed alarmedtoo</s> what became of him</s> i cannot say for certain ronald replied but if you ask my opinion ishould say that having no stomach for meeting people outside he justwent out the way i came in especially as i heard the worshipfulmagistrate say that a board in the attic had been lifted</s> the magistrates looked at each other in astonishment the mode of escapehad not occurred to any and the disappearance of the fugitive was nowexplained</s> i never heard such a tale one of the magistrates said after a pause</s> it passes belief that a lad belonging to the family of a worthy andrespectable citizen a bailie of the city and one who stands well withhis fellow townsmen should take a desperate leap from the wall through awindow of a house where a traitor was in hiding warn him that the housewas watched and give him time to escape while he defended the stairs</s> such a tale sure was never told in a court</s>  what say you bailie</s> i can say nought andrew said</s>  the boy is a good boy and a quiet onegiven to mischief like other boys of his age doubtless but alwaysamenable</s>  what can have possessed him to behave in such a wild manner icannot conceive but it seems to me that it was but a boys freak</s> it was no freak when he ran his sword through peter muirs shouldermr</s>  mwhirtle said</s>  ye will allow that neighbour anderson</s> the man must have run against the sword the bailie said seeing theboy scarce knows one end of a weapon from another</s> you are wrong there bailie one of the constables said for i haveseen him many a time going into the school of james macklewain and ihave heard a comrade say who knows james that the lad can handle asword with the best of them</s> i will admit at once ronald said that i have gone to macklewainsschool and learned fencing of him</s>  my father colonel leslie of glenlyonwas a gentleman and it was right that i should wield a sword and jamesmacklewain who had fought in the french wars and knew my father wasgood enough to teach me</s>  i may say that my guardian knew nothing ofthis</s> no indeed andrew said</s>  i never so much as dreamt of it</s>  if i haddone so he and i would have talked together to a purpose</s> leslie of glenlyon was concerned in the 15 was he not</s>  mr</s>  mwhirtlesaid and had to fly the country and his son seems to be treading inhis steps bailie</s>  i doubt ye have been nourishing a viper in yourbosom</s> at this moment the two constables returned and reported that certainly atile was loose as the prisoner had described and there were scratches asif of the feet of someone entering the window but the leap was one thatvery few men would undertake</s> your story is so far confirmed prisoner but it does not seem to usthat even had you seen two men watching a house it would be reasonablethat you would risk your neck in this way without cause</s>  clearly you haveaided and abetted a traitor to escape justice and you will be remanded</s> i hope before you are brought before us again you will make up yourmind to make a clean breast of it and throw yourself on the kingsmercy</s> ronald was accordingly led back to the cell the bailie being too muchoverwhelmed with surprise at what he had heard to utter any remonstrance</s> chapter iii free</s> after ronald had been removed from the court the woman was questioned</s> she asserted that her master was away and was she believed in franceand that in his absence she often let lodgings to strangers</s>  that twodays before a man whom she knew not came and hired a room for a fewdays</s>  that on the evening before hearing a noise in the attic she wentup with him and met ronald coming down stairs</s>  that when ronald saidthere were strange men outside the house and when immediately afterwardsthere was a great knocking at the door the man drew his sword andordered her to come up stairs with him</s>  that he then made her assist himto pull up a plank and thrust it from the attic to the wall and orderedher to replace it when he had gone</s>  she supposed he was a thief flyingfrom justice but was afraid to refuse to do his bidding</s> and why did you not tell us all this woman when we came in</s>  mr</s> mwhirtle asked sternly</s>  had ye told us we might have overtaken him</s> i was too much frightened the woman answered</s>  there were swords outand blood running and men using words contrary both to the law andscripture</s>  i was frighted enough before and i just put my apron over myhead and sat down till the hubbub was over</s>  and then as no one asked meany questions and i feared i might have done wrong in aiding a thief toescape i just held my tongue</s> no cross questioning could elicit anything further from the woman whoindeed seemed frightened almost out of her senses and the magistrate atlast ordered her to return to the house and remain there under thesupervision of the constable until again sent for</s> andrew anderson returned home sorely disturbed in his mind</s>  hitherto hehad told none even of his intimates that the boy living in his housewas the son of colonel leslie but had spoken of him as the child of anold acquaintance who had left him to his care</s>  the open announcement ofronald that he was the son of one of the leaders in the last rebellioncoming just as it did when the air was thick with rumours of anotherrising troubled him greatly and there was the fact that the boy hadunknown to him been learning fencing and lastly this interferencewhich had enabled a notorious emissary of the pretender to escape arrest</s> the boys story may be true as far as it goes he said to his wife whenrelating to her the circumstances for i have never known him to tell alie but i cannot think it was all the truth</s>  a boy does not take such adreadful leap as that and risk breaking his neck simply because he seestwo men near the house</s>  he must somehow have known that man was thereand went to give him warning</s>  now i think of it he passed through theshop when peter mwhirtle was talking to me about it though indeed hedid not know then where the loon was in hiding</s>  the boy went out soonafterwards and must somehow have learned if indeed he did not knowbefore</s>  janet i fear that you and i have been like two blind owls withregard to the boy and i dread sorely that my brother malcolm is at thebottom of all this mischief</s> this mrs</s>  anderson was ready enough to credit but she was too muchbewildered and horrified to do more than to shake her head and weep</s> will they cut off his head andrew</s>  she asked at last</s> no theres no fear of that but they may imprison him for a bit andperhaps give him a good flogging  the young rascal</s>  but there dontfret over it janet</s>  i will do all i can for him</s>  and in truth i thinkmalcolm is more to blame than he is and we have been to blame too forletting the lad be so much with him seeing that we might be sure hewould put all sorts of notions in the boys head</s> but what is to be done andrew</s>  we cannot let the poor lad remain inprison</s> we have no choice in the matter janet</s>  in prison he is and in prisonhe has to remain until he is let out and i see no chance of that</s>  if ithad only been a brawl with the watch it could have been got over easilyenough but this is an affair of high treason  aiding and abetting thekings enemies and the rest of it</s>  if it were in the old times theywould put the thumb screws on him to find out all he knew about it forthey will never believe he risked his life in the plot and the fact thathis father before him was in arms for the chevalier tells that way</s>  ishould not be surprised if an order comes for him to be sent to london tobe examined by the kings councillors but i will go round now and askthe justices what they think of the matter</s> his tidings when he returned were not encouraging the general opinion ofthe magistrates being that ronald was certainly mixed up in the jacobiteplot that the matter was altogether too serious to be disposed of bythem being of the nature of high treason and that nothing could be doneuntil instructions were received from london</s>  no clue had been obtainedas to the whereabouts of the man who had escaped and it was thoughtprobable that he had at once dropped beyond the walls and made for thewest</s> malcolm arrived ten days later from a journey in lancashire and therewas a serious quarrel between him and andrew on his presenting himself atthe house</s> it is not only that you led the lad into mischief malcolm but that youtaught him to do it behind my back</s> you may look at it in that way if you will andrew and its naturalenough from your point of view but i take no blame to myself you treatedthe boy as if he had been your son and i thank you with all my heart foryour kindness to him but i could not forget leslie of glenlyon and i donot blame myself that i have kept the same alive in his mind also</s>  it wasmy duty to see that the young eagle was not turned into a barn door fowlbut i never thought he was going to use his beak and his claws so soon</s> a nice thing you will have to tell his father that owing to yourteachings his son is a prisoner in the tower maybe for life</s>  but there theres no fear of that</s>  you will never have to render that accountfor theres no more chance of your ever hearing more of him than there isof my becoming king of scotland</s>  its bad enough that you have alwaysbeen a neer do well yourself without training that unfortunate boy tohis ruin</s> well well andrew i will not argue with you and i dont blame you atbeing sore and angry over the matter nor do i deny what you have saidabout myself its true enough and you might say worse things against mewithout my quarreling with ye over it</s>  however the less said the better</s> i will take myself off and think over whats to be done</s> you had better come up and have your supper with us andrew saidmollified by his brothers humility</s> not for twenty golden guineas andrew would i face mistress janet</s>  shehas borne with me well though i know in her heart she disapproves of mealtogether but after this scrape into which i have got the boy i darentface her</s>  she might not say much but to eat with her eye upon me wouldchoke me</s> malcolm proceeded at once to the establishment of his friend macklewain</s> this is a nice kettle of fish malcolm about young leslie</s>  i have hadthe justices down here asking me all sorts of questions and they havegot into their minds that i taught him not only swordplay but treasonand they have been threatening to put me in the stocks as a vagabond buti snapped my fingers in their faces saying i earned my money as honestlyas they did and that i concern myself in no way in politics but teachenglish officers and the sons of glasgow tradesmen as well as those ofhighland gentlemen</s>  they were nicely put out i can tell you but ididnt care for that for i knew i was in the right of it</s>  but what onearth made the young cock meddle in this matter</s>  how came he to be mixedup in a jacobite plot</s>  have you got your finger in it</s> not i james and how it happens that he is concerned in it is more thani can guess</s>  i know of course his heart is with the king over thewater but how he came to get his hand into the pie is altogether beyondme</s> the people here are well nigh mad about it</s>  i know not who the gallantwho has escaped is but it is certain that his capture was considered avery important one and that the justices here expected to have gained nosmall credit by his arrest whereas now they will be regarded as foolsfor letting him slip through their fingers</s> i cannot for the life of me make out how he came to be mixed up in sucha matter</s>  no one but you and i could have known that he was a lad ofmettle who might be trusted in such a business</s>  it can hardly be thatthey would have confided any secrets to him still the fact that he wasin the house with the man they are in search of and that he drew andrisked his life and certain imprisonment to secure his escape shows thathe must have been heart and soul in the plot</s> and what do you think of doing malcolm</s> i shall get him out somehow</s>  i can lay hands on a score or two or moreof our old comrades here in glasgow and i doubt not that they will allstrike a blow with me for leslies son to say nothing of his being afollower of the stuarts</s> you are not thinking man of attacking the jail</s>  that would be aserious matter</s>  the doors are strong and you would have the soldiers tosay nought of the town guard and the citizens upon you before you hadreached him</s> no no james i am thinking of no such foolishness</s>  i guess that theywill not be trying him for withstanding the watch thats but a smallmatter they will be sending him south for the kings ministers to getout of him what he knows about the jacobite plot and the names of allconcerned and its upon the road that we must get him out of theirhands</s>  like enough they will only send four troopers with him and we caneasily master them somewhere in the dales</s> its more like malcolm they will send him by ship</s>  they will know wellenough that if the lad knows aught there will be plenty whose interest itis to get him out of their hands</s>  i think they will take the safer way ofputting him on board ship</s> like enough they will malcolm agreed and in that case it will be aharder job than i deemed it</s>  but at any rate i mean to try</s>  ronalds notthe lad to turn traitor he will say nothing whatever they do to him youmay be sure and he may lie for years in an english prison if we do notget him out of their hands before he gets there</s>  at any rate what we havegot to do now is to mark every ship in the port sailing for london andto find out whether passages are taken for a prisoner and his guard inany of them</s>  i will make that my business and between times get a scoreof trusty fellows together in readiness to start if they should send himby land but i doubt not that you are right and that he will be takenoff by ship</s> the days of waiting passed slowly to ronald and andrew anderson once ortwice obtained permission to see him</s>  the bailie wisely abstained fromany reproaches and sought only to persuade him to make a clean breast ofthe business and to tell all he knew about a plot which could but end infailure and ruin to all concerned</s>  although his belief in ronaldstruthfulness was great he could not credit that the story which he hadtold contained all the facts of the matter</s>  to the bailie it seemedincredible that merely from an abstract feeling in favour of the stuartsronald would have risked his life and liberty in aiding the escape of ajacobite agent unless he was in some way deeply involved in the plotand he regarded ronalds assurances to the contrary as the outcome ofwhat he considered an entirely mistaken sense of loyalty to the stuartcause</s> its all very well ronald he said shaking his head sadly but whenthey get you to london they will find means to make you open your mouth</s> they have done away with the thumb screws and the rack but there areother ways of making a prisoner speak and it would be far better for youto make a clean breast of it at once</s>  janet is grieving for you as if youwere her own son and i cannot myself attend to my business</s>  who wouldhave thought that so young a lad should have got himself mixed up in suchsair trouble</s> i have really told you all bailie though you will not believe me andi am sorry indeed for the trouble i have brought upon you and my aunt for ronald had from the first been taught to address the bailie and hiswife as if malcolm anderson had been his real father anyhow i wish theywould settle it</s>  i would rather know the worst than go on from day to dayexpecting something that never happens</s> you have to wait ronald till word comes from london</s>  if they writefrom there that your case can be dealt with merely for the assault uponthe watch i can promise you that a few weeks in jail are all that you arelike to have but i fear that there is little chance of that</s>  they aresure to send for you to london and whether you will ever come back alivethe gude lord only knows</s>  we know what came of treason thirty years agoand like enough they will be even more severe now seeing that they willhold that folks have all the less right to try and disturb matters solong settled</s> have you seen malcolm</s>  ronald asked to change the conversation</s> ay lad i have seen him and the meeting was not altogether a pleasantone for either of us</s> i hope you have not quarrelled with him on my account</s>  ronald saideagerly</s> we have not exactly quarrelled but we have had words</s>  i could not buttell him my opinion as to his learning you to take such courses but weparted friends but i doubt it will be long before janet can see him withpatience</s> the jailer who was present at the interview here notified that thebailies time was up</s> i shall see you again ronald before they take you south</s>  i would thati could do more to help you besides just coming to see you</s> i know you cannot uncle</s>  i have got into the scrape and must take theconsequences but if i were placed in the same position i should do itagain</s> a few days afterwards as he was eating his ration of prison breadronald found in it a small pellet of paper and on opening it read thewords keep up your courage friends are at work for you</s>  you will hearmore yet of m</s>  a</s> ronald was glad to know that his old friend was thinking of him butknowing how strong was the prison he had little hopes that malcolm wouldbe able to effect anything to help him</s>  still the note gave him comfort</s> three days later andrew called again to bid him goodbye telling him thatorders had been received from london that he was to be sent thither byship</s> i should like to have seen malcolm before i went if i could ronaldsaid</s> i have not seen him for several days the bailie said</s>  i have sentdown several times to the house where he lodges but he is always awaybut whether or no there would be no chance of your seeing him</s>  i myselfhad difficulty in getting leave to see you though a bailie and known tobe a loyal citizen</s>  but malcolm knows that there would be no chance ofone with such a character as his getting to see you and that it woulddraw attention to him even to ask such a thing which if he has a handin this mad brain plot he would not wish</s> malcolm would not mind a straw whether they kept a watch on him or notronald said</s>  will you tell him when you see him next that i got hismessage</s> what message</s>  i have given you no message that i know of</s> he will know what i mean</s>  tell him whether aught comes of it or not ithank him and for all his kindness to me as i do you and aunt janet</s> at the same time with the order that ronald should be sent to london theauthorities of glasgow received an intimation that the ministers feltgreat surprise at the lukewarmness which had been shown in allowing sonotorious and important an enemy of his majesty to escape and that theking himself had expressed marked displeasure at the conduct of the cityauthorities in the matter</s>  greatly mortified at the upshot of an affairfrom which they had hoped to obtain much credit from government andbelieving it certain that there were many greatly interested in gettingronald out of the hands of his captors the authorities took everyprecaution to prevent it</s>  he was taken down to the river side under astrong escort and in addition to the four warders who were to be incharge of the prisoner as far as london they put on board twelve men ofthe city guard</s>  these were to remain with the ship until she was well outat sea and then to return in a boat which the vessel was to row behindher</s> ronald could not but smile when he saw all these formidable preparationsfor his safety</s>  at the same time he felt that any hope he had entertainedthat malcolm might as the message hinted make an attempt at rescue wereblighted</s>  the vessel dropped down with the tide</s>  the orders of thejustices had been so strict and urgent that the whole of the men placedon board kept a vigilant watch</s> just as they were abreast of dumbarton the sound of oars was heard andpresently a boat was seen approaching</s>  as it got nearer two men were seento be rowing and two others seated in the stern but as the craft was alarge one there was room for others to be lying in the bottom</s>  theconstable in charge shouted to the boat to keep them off</s> stop rowing he cried and come no nearer</s>  if you do we fire and as idont want to shed your blood i warn you that i have sixteen armed menhere</s> as his words were emphasized by the row of men who with levelled musketsranged themselves along at the side of the ship the boat ceased rowing</s> what are you afraid of</s>  one of the men in the stern shouted</s>  cannot afishermans boat row out without being threatened with shooting</s>  what areyou and your sixteen armed men doing on board</s>  are you expecting a frenchfleet off the coast</s>  and do you think you will beat them off if theyboard you</s>  how long have the glasgow traders taken to man their shipswith fighting men</s> ronald was in the cabin under the poop it opened on to the waist andreceived its light from an opening in the door at which two armed menhad stationed themselves when the boat was heard approaching</s>  had thecabin possessed a porthole through which he could have squeezed himselfhe would long before have jumped overboard and tried to make his escapeby swimming under cover of the darkness</s>  he now strove to force the dooropen for he recognized malcolms voice and doubted not that his friendhad spoken in order to let him know that he was there that he might ifpossible leap over and swim to the boat but it was fastened stronglywithout and the guards outside shouted that they would fire unless heremained quiet</s> no reply was made to the taunts of the man in the boat and slowly forthe wind was but just filling her sails the vessel dropped down theriver and the boat was presently lost sight of</s> in the morning the breeze freshened</s>  it was not till the ship was eightmiles beyond the mouth of the river that the boat was pulled upalongside and the guard taking their places on board hoisted sail andstarted on their return to glasgow</s> once fairly at sea ronald was allowed to leave his cabin</s>  now that he wasenjoying the fresh air his spirits soon recovered the tone which they hadlost somewhat during his three weeks confinement in prison and hethoroughly enjoyed his voyage</s>  the man who was in charge of the guard hadat first wished to place some restriction on his going about on board ashe chose but the crew sided with the young prisoner and threw suchridicule on the idea that four warders and a head constable were afraideven for a moment to lose sight of a boy on board a ship at sea that hegave way and allowed ronald free liberty of action although he warnedhis subordinates that they must nor relax their caution for a moment</s> the crew are all with him</s>  they think it a shame that a lad like thisshould be hauled to london as a prisoner charged with treasonablepractices and sailors when they once get an idea into their head areas obstinate as highland cattle</s>  i have told them that he drew a swordand held the staircase against us all while a noted traitor made hisescape and that he ran one of us through the shoulder and they onlyshouted with laughter and said he was a brave young cock</s>  like as notif they had a chance these men would aid him to escape and then weshould have to answer for it and heavily too loss of place andimprisonment would be the least of what we might expect so though whileat sea and in full daylight he can do as he pleases we must be doublyvigilant at night or in port if the vessel should have to put in</s> accordingly to the great disgust of the sailors the watch by turns stoodsentry outside ronalds door at night thereby defeating a plan which thesailors had formed of lowering a boat the first night they passed nearland and letting ronald make his escape to shore</s> the wind was favourable until the vessel rounded the lands end</s>  afterthat it became baffling and fickle and it was more than three weeksafter the date of her sailing from glasgow that the vessel entered themouth of the thames</s>  by this time ronalds boyish spirits had allayed allsuspicion on the part of his guards</s>  he joked with the sailors climbedabout the rigging like a cat and was so little affected by his positionthat the guards were convinced that he was free from the burden of anystate secret and that no apprehension of any serious consequence tohimself was weighing upon him</s> poor lad</s>  the head warder said he will need all his spirits</s>  he willhave hard work to make the kings council believe that he interfered insuch a matter as this from pure love of adventure</s>  he will have many aweary month to pass in prison before they free him i reckon</s>  it goesagainst my heart to hand over such a mere laddie as a prisoner still itis no matter of mine</s>  i have my duty to do and its not for me toquestion the orders i have received or to argue whether a prisoner isinnocent or guilty</s> as the vessel anchored off gravesend to wait for the turn of the tide totake her up a boat rowed by a waterman and with a man sitting in thestern passed close by the ship</s>  the head warder had now redoubled hisvigilance and one of the guards with loaded musket was standing on thedeck not far from ronald who was standing on the taffrail</s>  as the boatpassed some twenty yards astern of the ship the man who was not rowingturned round for a moment and looked up at ronald</s>  it was but a momentaryglance that the lad caught of his face and he suppressed with difficultya cry of surprise for he recognized malcolm anderson</s>  the rowercontinued steadily to ply his oars and continued his course towardsanother ship anchored lower down the river</s>  ronald stood watching theboat and saw that after making a wide sweep it was rowed back again togravesend</s> ronald had no doubt that malcolm had come south in hopes of effecting hisescape and guessed that he had taken up his post at gravesend with theintention of examining every ship as she passed up until the one in whichhe knew he had sailed made its appearance</s>  what his next step would be hecould not tell but he determined to keep a vigilant lookout and toavail himself instantly of any opportunity which might offer</s> as the captain did nor care about proceeding up the river after dark itwas not until the tide turned just as morning broke that the anchor wasweighed</s>  there was a light breeze which just sufficed to give the vesselsteerage way and a mist hung on the water</s>  ronald took his favouriteseat on the taffrail and kept a vigilant watch upon every craft whichseemed likely to come near the vessel</s> greenwich was passed and the vessel presently approached the crowdedpart of the pool</s>  it was near high tide now and the captain wascongratulating himself that he should just reach a berth opposite thetower before it turned</s>  presently a boat with two rowers shot out frombehind a tier of vessels and passed close under the stern of the glasgowlass</s>  a man was steering whom ronald instantly recognized</s> jump</s>  he cried and ronald without a moments hesitation leaped fromthe taffrail</s> he came up close to the boat and was instantly hauled on board bymalcolm</s>  just at that moment the guard who had stood stupefied byronalds sudden action gave a shout of alarm and discharged his piece</s> the ball struck the boat close to ronald</s>  it was already in motion themen bent to their oars and the boat glided towards the surrey side ofthe river</s>  loud shouts arose from on board the vessel and four bulletscut the water round the boar but before the muskets could be reloadedmalcolm had steered the boat through a tier of vessels whose crewsattracted by the firing cheered the fugitives lustily</s> a minute later they had reached some landing steps</s>  malcolm tossed somemoney to the rowers and then sprang ashore with ronald and handed thelatter a long coat which would reach to his heels and conceal thedrenched state of his clothing from notice</s> we have tricked them nicely dear boy he said we are safe now</s>  longbefore they can lower a boat and get here we shall be safe in shelterand our five glasgow bodies will have something to do to look for ushere</s> moderating his pace so as to avoid attracting attention malcolmproceeded along several streets and lanes and presently stopped at thedoor of a little shop</s> i am lodging here he said and have told the people of the house thati am expecting a nephew back from a cruise in the mediterranean</s> as he passed through the shop he said to the woman behind the counterhere he is safe and sound</s>  hes been some days longer than i expectedbut i was nor so very far wrong in my calculations</s>  the young scamp hashad enough of the sea and has agreed to go back again with me to his ownpeople</s> thats right the woman said</s>  my own boy ran away two years ago and ihope he will have come to his senses by the time he gets back again</s> when they were together in their room up stairs malcolm threw his armsround ronalds neck</s> thank god my dear boy i have got you our of the clutches of the law</s> you do not know how i have been fretting since i heard you were caughtand thought that if ill came to you it would be all my fault</s>  and nowtell me how you got into this scrape for it has been puzzling me eversince i heard it</s>  surely when i saw you last you knew nothing about anyjacobite goings on</s> ronald related the whole particulars of his adventure and said that evennow he was absolutely ignorant who was the man whom he had aided toescape</s> i know no more than you do ronald but they must have thought hiscapture an important one by the fuss they made over his escape</s>  and nowto think that you have slipped out of their hands too</s>  and malcolm brokeinto a loud laugh</s>  i would give a months earnings to see the faces ofthe guard as they make their report that they have arrived empty handed</s> i was right glad when i saw you</s>  i was afraid you might have given themthe slip on the way and then there would have been no saying when wemight have found each other again</s> the sailors would have lowered a boat at night and let me make for theland ronald said but there was a good guard kept over me</s>  the doorwas locked and a sentry always on watch and i had quite given up allhope until i saw you at gravesend</s>  and now what do you intend to do</s> make our way back to scotland</s> no no lad that would never do</s>  there will be a hue and cry after youand all the northern routes will be watched</s>  no i shall make a bargainwith some dutch skipper to take us across the water and then we willmake our way to paris</s> but have you got money malcolm</s> i have got your purse lad</s>  i went to andrew and said that i wanted itfor you but that he was to ask no questions so that whatever came of ithe could say that he knew nothing</s>  he gave it me at once saying onlyremember malcolm you have done the boy some harm already with yourteaching see that you do him no further harm</s>  i guess you are bent onsome hare brained plan but whatever it be i wish you success</s>
chapter iv in france</s> the next day malcolm went out alone and on his return told ronald thatthere were placards on the walls offering a reward of a hundred poundsfor his apprehension</s> you dont think the people below have any suspicion malcolm</s> not they malcolm replied</s>  i was telling them last night after you hadgone to bed all about the places you have been voyaging to and howanxious your father a snug farmer near newcastle was to have you backagain</s>  i had spoken to them before so as to prepare them for your comingand the old woman takes quite an interest in you because her son at seais a lad just about your age</s>  i have brought you in a suit of sailorclothes we will go down and have a chat with them after the shop isclosed of a night</s>  you will remember newcastle and the farm and can tellthem of your escape from greek pirates and how nearly you were taken bya french frigate near the straits</s> the consternation of the watch at ronalds escape was extreme</s>  the shotwhich the man on guard had fired was their first intimation of the eventand seizing their muskets they had hastily discharged them in thedirection of the fugitive and had then shouted for a boat to be lowered</s> but never was a boat longer getting into the water than was that of theglasgow lass upon this occasion</s>  the captain gave his orders in aleisurely way and the crew were even slower in executing them</s>  thensomehow the fall stuck and the boat wouldnt lower</s>  when at last she wasin the water it was found that the thole pins were missing these beingfound she was rowed across the river the five constables undergoing arunning fire of jokes and hilarity from the sailors of the ships theypassed near</s>  in answer to their inquiries where the fugitives landedsome of the sailors shouted that she had pulled up the river behind thetier of vessels others insisted that she had sunk with all hands closeby</s> completely bewildered the chief of the party told the sailors to putthem ashore at the first landing</s>  when the party gained the streets theyinquired eagerly of all they met whether they had seen aught of thefugitives</s>  few of those they questioned understood the broad scotch inwhich the question was asked others laughed in their faces and asked howthey were to know the man and boy they wanted from any others and aftervainly looking about for some time they returned to the stairs only tofind that the boat had returned to the ship</s> a watermans boat was now hired and the rower who had heard what hadhappened demanded a sum for putting them on board which horrified thembut at last after much bargaining they were conveyed back to the ship</s> an hour later the chief of the party went ashore and repairing to thetower where he had been ordered to conduct the prisoner reported hisescape</s>  he was at once taken into custody on the charge of permitting theescape of his prisoner and it was not until three days later upon theevidence of his men and of the captain and officers of the ship that hewas released</s> his four men were put on board a ship returning to glasgow next daywhile he himself was kept to identify the fugitive should he be caught</s> a week later malcolm told ronald that he had made arrangements with thecaptain of a dutch vessel to take them over to holland</s> we are to go on board at gravesend he said for they are searchingall ships bound for foreign ports</s>  it is not for you especially butthere are supposed to be many jacobites going to and fro and they willlay hands on anyone who cannot give a satisfactory account of himself</s>  soit is just as well for us to avoid questioning</s> accordingly the next day they walked down to gravesend and taking boatthere boarded the dutch vessel when she came along on the following day</s> the dutch captain received them civilly he had been told by malcolm thatthey wished to leave the country privately and guessed that they were insome way fugitives from the law but as he was to be well paid this gavehim no concern</s>  there were no other passengers and a roomy cabin wasplaced at their disposal</s>  they passed down the river without impedimentand anchored that night off sheerness</s> these dutch traders are but slow craft malcolm said as he walkedimpatiently up and down the deck next morning watching the slow progresswhich they made past the shore</s>  i wish we could have got a passagedirect to france but of course that is impossible now the two nationsare at war</s> what is the war about malcolm</s>  i heard at home that they were fightingbut yet that somehow the two countries were not at war</s> no i dont know how that comes about malcolm said</s>  england has aminister still at paris but for all that king george is at the head of anumber of british troops in germany fighting against the french there</s> but what is it about malcolm</s> well it is a matter which concerns hanover more than england in factengland has no interest in the matter at all as far as i can see exceptthat as france takes one side she takes the other because she is afraidof france getting too strong</s>  however it is a german business andengland is mixed up in it only because her present king is a hanoverianand not an englishman</s>  this is the matter as far as i can make it out</s> charles vi</s>  emperor of germany died in october 1740</s>  it had beenarranged by a sort of general agreement called the pragmatic sanction what an extraordinary name malcolm</s>  what does it mean</s> i have not the least idea in the world lad</s>  however that is what it iscalled</s>  it was signed by a lot of powers of whom england was one and byit all parties agreed that charless daughter maria theresa was to becomeempress of austria</s>  however when the emperor was dead the elector ofbavaria claimed to be emperor and he was supported by france by spainand by frederick of prussia and they marched to vienna enthroned theelector as duke of austria and drove maria theresa to take refuge inhungary where she was warmly supported</s> the english parliament voted a large sum to enable the empress to carryon the war and last year sixteen thousand men under the earl of staircrossed the seas to cooperate with the dutch who were warm supporters ofthe empress and were joined by six thousand hessians and sixteenthousand hanoverians in british pay but after all nothing was done lastyear for as in the last war the dutch were not ready to begin and theenglish army were in consequence kept idle</s> then it seems that everyone was against the empress except england andthese three little states</s> that is pretty nearly so malcolm said but at present the empress hasbought off the prussians whose king joined in the affair solely for hisown advantage by giving him the province of silesia so that in fact atpresent it is england and hanover which is all the same thing with thedutch and hessians against france and bavaria for i dont think that atpresent spain has sent any troops</s> well it seems to me a downright shame ronald said indignantly andthough i have no great love for the english and hate their hanoveriangeorge and his people i shouldnt like to fight with one of the scotchregiments in the french service in such a quarrel</s> malcolm laughed</s> my dear lad if every soldier were to discuss the merits of the quarrelin which he is ordered to fight there would be an end of all discipline</s> yes i see that ronald agreed if one is once a soldier he has onlyto obey orders</s>  but one need not become a soldier just at the time whenhe would be called upon to fight for a cause which he considers unjust</s> that is so ronald and its fortunate if your feelings are in favourof maria theresa that we are not thinking of enlisting just at presentfor you would be puzzled which side to take</s>  if you fought for her youwould have to fight under the hanoverian if you fight against thehanoverian you are fighting against maria theresa</s> well we dont want to fight at all ronald said</s>  what we want to dois to find out something about my father</s>  i wish the voyage was at anend and that we had our faces towards paris</s> it will not be so easy to cross from holland into france malcolm said</s> i wish our voyage was at an end for another reason for unless i mistakethere is a storm brewing up</s> malcolms prediction as to the weather was speedily verified</s>  the windrose rapidly ragged clouds hurried across the sky and the waves got upfast and by nightfall the sea had become really heavy dashing in sheetshigh in the air every time the bluff bowed craft plunged into it</s>  longbefore this ronald had gone below prostrate with seasickness</s> its just like the obstinacy of these dutchmen malcolm muttered tohimself as he held on by a shroud and watched the labouring ship</s>  itmust have been clear to anyone before we were well out of the river thatwe were going to have a gale and as the wind then was nearly due southwe could have run back again and anchored in shelter till it was over</s> now it has backed round nearly into our teeth with every sign of itsgetting into the north and then we shall have the french coast on ourlee</s>  its not very serious yet but if the wind goes on rising as it hasdone for the last four or five hours we shall have a gale to rememberbefore the morning</s> before the daylight indeed a tremendous sea was running and the windwas blowing with terrible force from the north</s>  although under but a ragof canvas the brig was pressed down gunwale deep and each wave as itstruck her broadside seemed to heave her bodily to leeward</s>  malcolm oncoming on deck made his way aft and glanced at the compass and then tooka long look over the foaming water towards where he knew the french coastmust lie</s>  the wind was two or three points east of north and as theclumsy craft would not sail within several points of the wind she washeading nearly east</s> she is making a foot to leeward for every one she forges ahead he saidto himself</s>  if she has been at this work all night we cannot be far fromthe coast</s> so the dutch skipper appeared to think for a few minutes afterwards hegave orders to bring her about on the other tack</s>  three times they triedand failed each time the vessel slowly came up into the wind but theheavy waves forced her head off again before the headsails filled</s>  thenthe skipper gave orders to wear her</s>  her head payed off to the wind untilshe was nearly before it</s>  two or three great seas struck her stern andburied her head deeply but at last the boom swung over and her head cameup on the other tack</s>  during the course of these manoeuvres she had madefully two miles leeway and when she was fairly under sail with her headto the west malcolm took another long look towards the south</s> just as i thought he said</s>  there is white water there and a dark linebehind it</s>  that is the french coast sure enough</s> it would have been useless to speak but he touched the arm of theskipper and pointed to leeward</s>  the skipper looked in this direction

force of the waves wasdriving her faster towards the coast than she could make off it and hewent below and told ronald to come on deck</s> i would rather lie here ronald said</s> nonsense lad</s>  the

number of ropes were thrown</s>  most ofthe sailors seeing the danger of being crushed followed the example ofmalcolm and left the masts</s>  malcolm and ronald swam just outside thepoint where the waves broke until a line fell in the water close to them</s> they grasped it at once</s> give it a twist round your arm malcolm shouted or the backwash willtear you from it</s> the sailors on shore

greatrapidity then as he touched the ground with his feet they were sweptfrom under him and so great was the strain that he felt as if his armwas being pulled from the socket</s>  a few seconds later he was lying atfull length upon the sands and before the next wave reached him a dozenmen had rushed down and seized him and malcolm and carried them beyondits influence</s>  for a minute or two

bit but no worse</s> one by one the sailors were brought ashore one with both legs brokenfrom the force with which he was dashed down by the surf and one man whostuck to the mast was crushed to death

proprietor of the placeapproached to take their order</s>  so you are still in the flesh man</s> right glad am i to see you again</s> i know your face sandy replied but i canna just say what your namemight be</s> malcolm anderson of leslies scotch regiment</s>  its fourteen years sincei left them now but i was here again four years later if you canremember when i came over to try and find out if aught had been heard ofthe colonel</s> ay ay sandy said grasping malcolms outstretched hand warmly</s>  itall comes back to me now</s>  right glad am i to see you</s>  and who is the ladye have brought with you</s>  a scot by his face and bearing i will bebound but young yet for the service if that be what he is thinking of</s> he is the colonels son sandy</s>  you will remember i told you i hadcarried him back to scotland with me but i need not tell ye that this isbetwixt ourselves for those who have so badly treated his father mightwell have a grudge against the son and all the more that he is therightful heir to many a broad acre here in france</s> i give you a hearty welcome young sir sandy said</s>  many a time i haveseen your brave father riding at the head of his regiment and havespoken to him too for he and his officers would drop in here and crack acup together in a room i keep upstairs for the quality</s>  well well andto think that you are his son</s>  but what malcolm said is true and it werebest that none knew who ye are for they have an unco quick way here ofputting inconvenient people out of the way</s> have you ever heard aught of my father since</s>  ronald asked eagerly</s> not a word sandy replied</s>  i have heard it talked over scores of timesby men who were in the regiment that was once his and none doubted thatif he were still alive he was lying in the bastille or vincennes or oneof the other cages where they keep those whose presence the king or hisfavourites find inconvenient</s>  its just a stroke of the pen withoutquestion or trial and they are gone and even their best friends darenaask a question concerning them</s>  in most cases none know why they havebeen put away but there is no doubt why leslie was seized</s>  three or fourof his fellow officers were in the secret of his marriage and when hehad disappeared these talked loudly about it and there was sair griefand anger among the scottish regiment at leslies seizure</s>  but what wasto be done</s>  it was just the kings pleasure and that is enough infrance</s>  leslie had committed the grave offence of thwarting the wishes oftwo of the kings favourites great nobles too with broad lands andgrand connections</s>  what were the likings of a scottish soldier of fortuneand a headstrong girl in comparison</s>  in scotland in the old times agallant who had carried off a daughter of a douglas or one of ourpowerful nobles would have made his wife a widow ere many weeks wereover and it is the same thing here now</s>  it wouldna have been an easything for his enemies to kill leslie with his regiment at his back andso they got an order from the king and as surely got rid of him as ifthey had taken his life</s> you have never heard whether my mother has married again</s>  ronald asked</s> i have never heard her name mentioned</s>  her father is still at court buthis daughter has never been seen since or i should have heard of it butmore than that i cannot say</s> that gives me hopes that my father is still alive ronald said</s>  had hebeen dead they might have forced her into some other marriage</s> they might so but she was plainly a lassie who had a will of her ownand may have held out</s> but why did they not kill him instead of putting him in prison if he wasin their way</s> they might as i said have done it at once but once in prison he wasbeyond their reach</s>  the king may grant a lettre de cachet as theseorders are called to a favourite but even in france men are not put todeath without some sort of trial and even chateaurouge and de recambourscould not ask louis to have a man murdered in prison to gratify theirprivate spite especially when that man was a brave scottish officerwhose fate had already excited much discontent among his compatriots inthe kings service</s>  then again much would depend upon who was thegovernor of the prison</s>  these men differ like others</s>  some of them arehonourable gentlemen to whom even louis himself would not venture tohint that he wanted a prisoner put out of the way but there are otherswho to gratify a powerful nobleman would think nothing of telling ajailer to forget a fortnight to give food to a prisoner</s>  so you see wecannot judge from this</s>  and now what are you thinking of doing malcolmand why are you over here</s> in the first place we are over here because young leslie took after hisfather and aided a jacobite whom georges men were in search of toescape and drew his sword on a worshipful justice of glasgow and thecity watch</s> he has begun early sandy said laughing and how did he get away</s> they brought him down a prisoner to london to interrogate him as to theplot</s>  i had a boat in the thames and he jumped over and swam for it sohere we are</s>  there are rumours in scotland that king louis is helpingprince charlie and that an army is soon going to sail for scotland</s> it is talked of here but so far nothing is settled but as king georgeis interfering in louiss affairs and is fighting him in germany ithink it more than likely that king louis is going to stir up a coil inscotland to give george something to do at home</s> then if theres nothing to be done here i shall find out the oldregiment</s>  there will be many officers in it still who have fought underleslie and some of them may know more about him than you do and willsurely be able to tell me what has become of the lads mither</s> that may well be so but keep a quiet tongue malcolm as to lesliesson save to those on whose discretion you can rely</s>  i tell you if itwere known that he is alive and in france his life would not be worth aweeks purchase</s>  they would not take the trouble to get a lettre decachet for him as they did for his father it would be just a pistolbullet or a stab on a dark night or in a lonely place</s>  there would be noquestion asked about the fate of an unknown scotch laddie</s> i will be careful sandy and silent</s>  the first thing is to find outwhere the old regiment is lying</s> that i can tell you at once</s>  it is on the frontier with the duc denoailles and they say that there is like to be a great battle withenglish george and his army</s> well as we have nothing else to do we will set out and find themmalcolm said but as time is not pressing we will stop a few days herein paris and i will show the lad the sights</s>  i suppose you can put usup</s> that can i</s>  times are dull at present</s>  after 15 paris swarmed withscotsmen who had fled to save their heads but of late years but few havecome over and the scotch regiments have difficulty in keeping up theirnumbers</s>  since the last of them marched for the frontier i have beenlooking after empty benches and it will be good news for me when i hearthat the war is over and they are on their way back</s> for some days malcolm and ronald wandered about the narrow streets ofparis</s>  ronald was somewhat disappointed in the city of which he had heardso much</s>  the streets were ill paved and worse lighted and were narrowand winding</s>  in the neighbourhood of the louvre there were signs ofwealth and opulence</s>  the rich dresses of the nobles contrasted stronglyindeed with the sombre attire of the glasgow citizens and the appearanceand uniform of the royal guards filled him with admiration but beyondthe fashionable quarter it did not appear to him that paris possessedmany advantages over glasgow and the poorer class were squalid andpoverty stricken to a far greater degree than anything he had seen inscotland</s>  but the chief points of attraction to him were the prisons</s>  thebastille the chatelet and the temple were points to which he wascontinually turning the two former especially since if he were inparis it was in one of these that his father was most probably lying</s> the various plans he had so often thought over by which in some way orother he might communicate with his father and aid his escape wereroughly shattered at the sight of these buildings</s>  he had reckoned ontheir resembling in some respect the prison in glasgow and at the sightof these formidable fortresses with their lofty walls and flankingtowers their moats and vigilant sentries his hopes fell to zero</s>  itwould he saw at once be absolutely impossible to open communicationwith a prisoner of whose whereabouts he was wholly ignorant and of whosevery existence he was doubtful</s>  the narrow slits which lighted the cellin which he was confined might look into an inner court or the cellitself might be below the surface of the soil</s>  the legend of thetroubadour who discovered king richard of englands place of captivity bysinging without the walls had always been present in his mind but nosuch plan would be practicable here</s>  he knew no song which his fatherand his father only would recognize and even did he know such a songthe appearance of anyone loitering in the open space outside the moatround the bastille singing at intervals at different points would haveinstantly attracted the attention of the sentries on the walls</s>  nor evendid he discover that his father was lying a prisoner in one of the cellsfacing outwards in the fortress did he see any possibility of compassinghis escape</s>  the slits were wide enough only for the passage of a ray oflight or the flight of an arrow</s>  no human being could squeeze himselfthrough them and even if he could do so he would need a long rope todescend into the moat</s> one day ronald talked over his ideas with malcolm who declared at oncethat they were impossible of execution</s> there is scarcely a case on record he said of an escape from eitherthe bastille or the chatelet and yet there have been scores of prisonersconfined in them with friends of great influence and abundant means</s>  ifthese have been unable by bribing jailers or by other strategy to freetheir friends how could a stranger without either connectioninfluence or wealth hope to effect the escape of a captive were hecertain that he was within the walls</s>  do not waste your thought on suchfancies ronald</s>  if your father is still in prison it is by influenceonly and influence exerted upon the king and exceeding that of yourfathers enemies that his release can be obtained</s> such influence there is no possibility of our exerting</s>  your fatherscomrades and countrymen his position and services availed nothing whenhe was first imprisoned and in the time which has elapsed the number ofthose who know him and would venture to risk the kings displeasure bypleading his cause must have lessened considerably</s>  the only possibilitymind i say possibility of success lies in your mother</s> so far it is clear that she has been powerless but we know not underwhat circumstances she has been placed</s>  she may all this time have beenshut up a prisoner in a convent she may be dead but it is possiblethat if she is free she may have powerful connections on her mothersside who might be induced to take up her cause and to plead with theking for your fathers liberty</s>  she may have been told that your fatheris dead</s>  she is no doubt in ignorance of what has become of you orwhether you are still alive</s>  if she believes you are both dead she wouldhave had no motive for exerting any family influence she may have andmay be living a broken hearted woman firm only in the resolution toaccept no other husband</s> yes that is possible ronald agreed</s>  at any rate malcolm let uslose no further time but set out tomorrow for the frontier and try tofind out from my fathers old comrades what has become of my mother</s> chapter v dettingen</s> after walking two or three miles malcolm and ronald came upon the rear ofa train of waggons which had set out from paris an hour earlier</s>  enteringinto conversation with one of the drivers they found that the convoy wasbound for the frontier with ammunition and supplies for the army</s> this is fortunate malcolm said for to tell you the truth ronald ihave looked forward to our meeting with a good many difficulties by theway</s>  we have no passes or permits to travel and should be suspected ofbeing either deserters or thieves</s>  we came down from the north easyenough but there they are more accustomed to the passage of travellersto or from the coast</s>  going east our appearance if alone would be sure toincite comment and suspicion</s>  it is hard if among the soldiers with theconvoy i do not know someone who has friends in the old regiment</s>  at anyrate we can offer to make ourselves useful in case of any of the driversfalling ill or deserting by the way</s> as they walked along towards the head of the long line of waggons malcolmclosely scrutinized the troopers who formed the escort but most of themwere young soldiers and he therefore went on without accosting themuntil he reached the head of the column</s>  here two officers were ridingtogether a captain and a young lieutenant</s>  malcolm saluted the former</s> i am an old soldier of the 2d regiment of scottish calvary and am goingwith my young friend here who has relations in the regiment to jointhem</s>  will you permit us sir to journey with your convoy</s>  we are readyif needs be to make ourselves useful in case any of your drivers aremissing no uncommon thing as i know on a long journey</s> the officer asked a few questions about his services and said whathave you been doing since you left as you say fourteen years ago</s> i have been in scotland sir</s>  i took this lad who was then an infanthome to my people having had enough of soldiering while my brother hisfather remained with the regiment</s>  we do not know whether he is alive ordead but if the former the lad wants to join as a trumpeter and whenold enough to fight in the ranks</s> very well the officer said</s>  you can march along with us and if anyof these fellows desert you shall take their places and of course drawtheir pay</s> it was a short time indeed before malcolms services were called intorequisition for the very first night several of the drivers who hadbeen pressed into the service managed to elude the vigilance of theguard and slipped away</s> the next morning malcolm with ronald as his assistant took charge ofone of the heavy waggons loaded with ammunition and drawn by twelvehorses</s> this is better than walking after all ronald</s>  in the first place itsaves the legs and in the second one is partly out of the dust</s> but i think we should get on faster walking malcolm</s> yes if we had no stoppages</s>  but then you see as we have no papers wemight be detained for weeks by some pig headed official in a littlecountry town besides we are sure to push on as fast as we can for theywill want the ammunition before a battle is fought</s>  and after all a fewdays wont make much difference to us the weather is fine and thejourney will not be unpleasant</s> in fact ronald enjoyed the next three weeks greatly as the train ofwaggons made its way across the plains of champagne and then on throughthe valleys of lorraine and alsace until it reached strasbourg</s>  malcolmhad speedily made friends with some of the soldiers of the escort and ofan evening when the days work was over he and ronald sat with them bythe fires they made by the roadside and malcolm told tales of thecampaigns in which he had been engaged and the soldiers sang songs andchatted over the probabilities of the events of the war</s>  none of them hadserved before having been but a few months taken from their homes invarious parts of france</s>  but although doubtless many had at firstregretted bitterly being dragged away to the wars they were now allreconciled to their lot and looked forward eagerly to joining theirregiment which was at the front when the duty of looking after theconvoy would be at an end</s> little was known in paris as to the position of the contending armiesbeyond the fact that lord stair who commanded the english army sixteenthousand strong which had for the last year been lying inactive inflanders had marched down with his hanoverian allies towards the maineand that the duc de noailles with sixty thousand men was lying beyond therhine</s>  but at strasbourg they learned that the french army had marchednorth to give

had possession of the bridges</s>  as soon as the waggons hadjoined the army malcolm obtained from the officer commanding the escorta discharge saying that he and ronald had fulfilled their engagement

yet had the opportunity oflooking on at one comfortably</s>  de noailles should lose no time inattacking so as to destroy the english before they receive theirreinforcements</s>  as he holds the bridges he can bring on the battle whenhe likes and i think that tomorrow or next day the fight will takeplace</s> it was known in the camp that evening that the english had establishedtheir chief magazines at hanau and were marching up the river towardsaschaffenburg</s>  in the early morning a portion of the french troopscrossed the river at that town and took up a strong position there</s> ronald and malcolm climbed a hill looking down upon the river from thesouth side and thence commanded the view of the ground across which theenglish were marching</s>  on the eastern side of the river

am afraid so ronald said</s> afraid</s>  malcolm repeated</s>  why you should rejoice ronald</s> i cant do that ronald replied</s>  i should like to see the stuartsinstead of the hanoverians reigning

replied</s>  you yourself told me thatlouis cared nothing for the stuarts and would only aid them in order tocripple the english strength at home</s>  therefore if he destroys theenglish army here he will have less cause to fear england and so lessmotive for helping the chevalier</s> that is true enough malcolm agreed</s>  you are fast becoming apolitician ronald</s>  well i will look on as a

magazines at hanau which from their ignorance of thenear proximity of the french had been left but weakly guarded</s>  believingthat as they fell back they would be hotly pursued by the french armythe king took the command of the rear as the post of danger and thecolumns facing about marched towards dettingen</s> but the french had been beforehand with them</s>
 he himself with his main army remained on the south side withhis artillery placed so as to fire across the river upon the flank of theenglish as they approached dettingen while he could march up and crossat aschaffenburg should the english after being beaten back atdettingen try to retreat up the river</s> de grammonts position was a very strong one behind a swamp and a deepravine hollowed out by a stream from the hill</s>  there seemed nopossibility of escape for the english army who were as yet absolutely inignorance of the position of the french</s>  as the head of the columnapproached dettingen grammonts artillery opened upon them in frontwhile that of de noailles smote them in flank</s>  as soon as the king foundthat his retreat was cut off he galloped from the rear of the column toits head</s>  his horse alarmed by the fire of the artillery and whistlingof balls ran away with him and was with difficulty stopped just as hereached the head of the column</s>  he at once dismounted and announced hisintention of leading his troops on foot</s> there was a hasty council held between him lord stair and the duke ofcumberland and it was agreed that the only escape from entiredestruction was by fighting their way through the force now in front ofthem</s>  this would indeed have been impossible had de grammont held hisposition but when that officer saw the english troops halt he believedhe had only the advanced guard in front of him and resolving tooverwhelm these before their main body arrived he abandoned his strongposition led the troops across the swamp and charged the english infront</s> de noailles from the opposite bank seeing the error his nephew hadmade hurried his troops towards the bridges in order to cross the riverand render him assistance but it was too late</s> the english infantry headed by the king in person hurled themselvesupon the troops of de grammont</s> every man felt that the only hope of escape from this trap into whichthey had fallen lay in cutting their way through the enemy and sofuriously did they fight that de grammonts troops were utterlyoverthrown and were soon in full flight towards the bridges in the rearhotly pursued by the english</s>
 before they could reach the bridges theyleft behind them on the field six thousand killed and wounded</s>  kinggeorge satisfied with his success and knowing that the french army wasstill greatly

heart alive but its malcolm anderson</s>  eh man but i am glad to seeyou</s>  i thought you were dead years ago for i have heard nae mair of yousince the day when you disappeared from among us like a spook the sameday that puir colonel leslie was hauled off to the bastille</s>  a sair daywas that for us a</s>  and where ha ye been all the time</s> back at home angus at least in body for my hearts been with the oldregiment</s>  and who think you is this</s>  but you must keep a close mouthman for it must nor be talked of</s>  this is leslies son</s>  by his fatherslast order i took him off to scotland with me to be out of reach of hisfoes and now i have brought him back again to try if between us we cangain any news of his father</s> you dont say so malcolm</s>  i never as much heard that the colonel had ason though there was some talk in the regiment that he had married agreat lady and that it was for that that he had been hid away in prison</s> and this is leslies boy</s>  only to think now</s>  well young sir thereisnt a man in the regiment but wad do his best for your fathers sonfor those who have joined us since and in truth thats the great part ofus have heard many a tale of colonel leslie though they may not haveserved under him and not a tale but was to his honour for a braverofficer nor a kinder one never stepped the earth</s>  but come insidemalcolm</s>  i have got a room to myself and a stoup of good wine lets talkover things fair and gentle and when i know what it is that you want youmay be sure that i will do all i can for the sake baith of the coloneland of you auld comrade</s> the trio were soon seated in the cottage and malcolm then gave a shortsketch of all that had taken place since he had left the regiment</s> well well</s>  the sergeant said when he had ended and so the lad youngas he is has already drawn his sword for the stuarts and takes afterhis father in loyalty as well as in looks for now that i know who he isi can see his fathers face in his plain enough and now for your plansmalcolm</s> our plans must be left to chance angus</s>  we came hither to see whetherany of the colonels friends are still in the regiment and to learn fromthem whether they have any news whatever of him and secondly whetherthey can tell us aught of his mother</s> ay there are six or eight officers still in the regiment who servedwith him</s>  hume is our colonel now you will remember him malcolm wellfor he was captain of our troop and major macpherson was a captain too</s> then there are oliphant and munroe and campbell and graham all ofwhom were young lieutenants in your time and are now old captains oftroops</s> i will see the colonel and macpherson malcolm said if they do notknow the younger men are not likely to</s>  will you go along with usangus and introduce me though hume is like enough to remember meseeing that i was so much with leslie</s> they will be dining in half an hour the sergeant said well go afterthey have done the meal</s>  its always a good time to talk with men whenthey are full and the colonel will have no business to disturb him then</s> our own dinner will be ready directly i can smell a goose that i pickedup as it might be by accident at the place where we halted last night</s> there are four or five of us old soldiers who always mess together whenwe are not on duty with our troops and if i mistake not you will knowevery one of them and right glad they will be to see you but of coursei shall say no word as to who the lad is save that he is a friend ofyours</s> a few minutes later four other sergeants dropped in and there was ajoyful greeting between them and malcolm as soon as they recognized hisidentity</s>  the meal was a jovial one as old jokes and old reminiscenceswere recalled</s>  after an hours sitting angus saidpass round the wine lads till we come back again</s>  i am taking andersonto the colonel who was captain of his troop</s>  we are not likely to belong and when we come back we will make a night of it in honour of oldtimes or i am mistaken</s> on leaving the cottage they waited for a while until they saw the coloneland major rise from beside the fire round which with the other officersthey had been taking their meal and walk to the cottage which theyshared between them</s>  angus went up and saluted</s> what is it graeme</s>  the colonel asked</s> theres one here who would fain have a talk with you</s>  it is malcolmanderson whom you may remember as puir colonel leslies servant and asbeing in your own troop and he has brought one with him concerning whomhe will speak to you himself</s> of course i remember anderson the colonel said</s>  he was devoted toleslie</s>  bring him in at once</s>  what can have brought him out here againafter so many years</s>  been getting into some trouble at home i suppose</s> he was always in some scrape or other when he was in the regiment forthough he was a good soldier he was as wild and reckless a blade as anyin the regiment</s>  you remember him macpherson</s> yes i remember him well the major said</s>  the colonel was very fond ofhim and regarded him almost as a brother</s> a minute later angus ushered malcolm and ronald into the presence of thetwo officers who had now taken seats in the room which served as kitchenand sitting room to the cottage which was much the largest in thevillage</s> well anderson i am glad to see you again colonel hume said risingand holding out his hand</s>  we have often spoken of you since the day youdisappeared saying that you were going on a mission for the colonel andhave wondered what the mission was and how it was that we never heard ofyou again</s> i came over to paris four years later colonel but the regiment wasaway in flanders and as i found out from others what i had come tolearn there was no use in my following you</s>  as to the colonels missionit was this and he put his hand on ronalds shoulder</s> what do you mean anderson</s>  the colonel asked in surprise</s> this is colonel leslies son sir</s>  he bade me fetch him straight awayfrom the folk with whom he was living and take him off to scotland so asto be out of reach of his foes who would doubtless have made evenshorter work with him than they did with the colonel</s> good heavens</s>  the colonel exclaimed this is news indeed</s>  so poorleslie left a child and this is he</s>  my lad he said taking ronaldshand believe me that anything that i can do for you whatever it beshall be done for the sake of your dear father whom i loved as an elderbrother</s> and i too the major said</s>  there was not one of us but would havefought to the death for leslie</s>  and now sit down my lad while andersontells us your story</s> malcolm began at the account of the charge which colonel leslie hadcommitted to him and the manner in which he had fulfilled it</s>  he toldthem how he had placed the child in the care of his brother he himselfhaving no fixed home of his own and how the lad had received a solideducation while he had seen to his learning the use of his sword sothat he might be able to follow his fathers career</s>  he then told themthe episode of the jacobite agent and the escape which had been effectedin the thames</s> you have done well anderson the colonel said when he had concludedand if ever leslie should come to see his son he will have cause tothank you indeed for the way in which you have carried out the chargehe committed to you and he may well be pleased at seeing him grown upsuch a manly young fellow</s>  as to leslie himself we know not whether hebe alive or dead</s>  every interest was made at the time to assuage hismajestys hostility but the influence of the marquis of recambours wastoo strong and the king at last peremptorily forbade leslies name beingmentioned before him</s>  you see although the girls father was of courseat liberty to bestow her hand on whomsoever he pleased he had with thetoadyism of a courtier asked the kings approval of the match withchateaurouge which as a matter of course he received</s>  his majestytherefore chose to consider it as a personal offence against himselfthat this scottish soldier of fortune should carry off one of the richestheiresses of france whose hand he had himself granted to one of hispeers</s>  at the same rime i cannot but think that leslie still lives forhad he been dead we should assuredly have heard of the marriage of hiswidow with some one else</s>  the duke has of course long since marriedand report says that the pair are illmatched but another husband wouldspeedily have been found for the widow</s> since the duke has married ronald said he should no longer be sobitter against my father and perhaps after so long an imprisonment theking might be moved to grant his release</s> as the dukes marriage is an unhappy one i fear that you cannot countupon his hostility to your father being in any way lessened as he wouldall the more regret the interference with his former plans</s> have you any idea where my mother is sir</s> none the colonel said</s>  but that i might find out for you</s>  i will giveyou a letter to the count de noyes who is on intimate terms with thearchbishop of paris who would no doubt be able to tell him in whichconvent the lady is residing</s>  you must not be too sanguine my poor boyof seeing her for it is possible that she has already taken the veil</s> indeed if your father has died and she has still refused to accept anysuitor whom the marquis may have found for her you may be sure that shehas been compelled to take the veil as her estates would then revert tothe nearest kinsman</s>  this may for aught we know have happened yearsago without a word of it being bruited abroad and the affair only knownto those most concerned</s>  however we must look at the best side</s>  we shallbe able doubtless to learn through the archbishop whether she is stillmerely detained in the convent or has taken the veil and you can thenjudge accordingly whether your father is likely to be alive or dead</s>  butas to your obtaining an interview with your mother i regard it asimpossible in the one case as the other</s> at any rate it is of the highest importance that it should not be knownthat you are in france</s>  if it is proved that your father is dead and yourmother is secluded for life we must then introduce you to her familyand try and get them to bring all their influence to bear to have youacknowledged openly as the legitimate heir of the marquis and to obtainfor you the succession to at least a portion of his estates  say tothat of those which she brought him as her dowry</s>  in this you may be surethat i and every scottish gentleman in the army will give you all the aidand influence we can bring to bear</s> ronald warmly thanked colonel hume for his kindness and the next dayhaving received the letter to the count de noyes set out for paris withmalcolm</s>  on his arrival there he lost no time in calling upon the countand presenting his letter of introduction</s> the count read it through twice without speaking</s> my friend colonel hume he said at last tells me that you are theson born in lawful wedlock of colonel leslie and amelie de recambours</s> i am aware of the circumstances of the case being distantly related tothe ladys family and will do that which colonel hume asks me namelydiscover the convent in which she is living</s>  but i warn you young manthat your position here is a dangerous one and that were it known thatcolonel leslies son is alive and in france i consider your life wouldnot be worth a days purchase</s>  when powerful people are interested in theremoval of anyone not favoured with powerful protection the matter iseasily arranged</s>  there are hundreds of knives in paris whose use can bepurchased for a few crowns of if seclusion be deemed better thanremoval a kings favourite can always obtain a lettredecachet and aman may linger a lifetime in prison without a soul outside the wallsknowing of his existence there</s> you are an obstacle to the plans of a great noble and that is in francea fatal offence</s>  your wisest course young man would be to effaceyourself to get your friend colonel hume to obtain for you a commissionin his regiment and to forget for ever that you are the son of colonelleslie and amelie de recambours</s>  however in that you will doubtlesschoose for yourself but believe me my advice is good</s>  at any rate i willdo what my friend colonel hume asks me and will obtain for you the nameof the convent where your mother is living</s>  i do not see that you will beany the better off when you have it for assuredly you will nor be ableto obtain permission to see her</s>  however that again is your affair</s>  ifyou will give me the address where you are staying in paris i will writeto you as soon as i obtain the information</s>  do not be impatient thearchbishop himself may be in ignorance on the point but i doubt notthat to oblige me he will obtain the information from the right quarter</s> a week later ronald on returning one day to le soldat ecossais found anote awaiting him</s>  it contained only the wordsshe has not taken the veil she is at the convent of our lady at tours</s> the next morning ronald and malcolm set out on their journey to tours</s> chapter vi the convent of our lady</s> arrived at tours malcolm took a quiet lodging in a retired street</s> colonel hume had furnished him with a regular discharge testifying thatthe bearer malcolm anderson had served his time in the 2d scotchdragoons and was now discharged as being past service and that herecommended him as a steady man for any employment for which he might besuited</s>  malcolm showed this document to his landlord in order that thelatter might as required by law duly give notice to the police of thename and occupation of his lodger and at the same time mentioned thatthe relations of his wife lived near tours and that he hoped throughthem to be able to obtain some sort of employment</s> as soon as they were settled in their lodgings they went out and after afew inquiries found themselves in front of the convent of our lady</s>  itwas a massive building in a narrow street near the river to which itsgrounds surrounded by a high wall extended</s>  none of the windows of thebuilding looked towards the street upon which the massive gate with asmall wicket entrance opened</s> what building is this</s>  malcolm in a careless tone asked a woman whowas sitting knitting at her door nearly opposite the entrance</s>  i am astranger in tours</s> that needs no telling the woman replied or you would have known thatthat is the convent of our lady one of the richest in touraine and theysay in all france</s>  though what they do with their riches is more than ican tell seeing that the rules are of the strictest and that no oneever comes beyond the gates</s>  they have their own grounds down to theriver and there is a walk along the wall there where they take the airof an evening when the weather is fine</s>  poor things i pity them from mysoul</s> but i suppose they all came willingly malcolm said so there is noneed for pity</s> i dont know about willingly the woman said</s>  i expect most of themtook the veil rather than marry the men their fathers provided for themor because they were in the way of someone who wanted their lands orbecause their lovers had been killed in the war just as if grief for alover was going to last ones life</s>  besides they are not all sisters</s> they say theres many a lady of good family shut up there till she willdo her fathers will</s>  well well i often says to myself they mayhave all the riches of france inside those walls but i would rather sitknitting at my door here than have a share of them</s> you are a wise woman malcolm said</s>  there is nothing like freedom</s> give me a crust and a sod for my pillow rather than gold plates insidea prison</s>  i have been a soldier all my life and have had my share ofhard knocks but i never grumbled so long as i was on a campaign thoughi often found it dull work enough when in garrison</s> oh you have been a soldier</s>  i have a brother in the regiment oftouraine</s>  perhaps you know him</s> i know the regiment of touraine malcolm said and there are no braverset of men in the kings service</s>  what is his name</s> pierre pitou</s>  i have not heard of him for the last two years</s>  he is atall man and broad with a scar over the left eye</s> to be sure to be sure</s>  malcolm said</s>  of course pierre pitou is oneof my best friends and now i think of it madam i ought to know withoutasking so great is his resemblance to you</s>  why his last words to mewere if you go to tours seek out my sister who lives in a housenearly opposite the entrance to the convent of our lady and to think ishould have forgotten all about it till i saw you</s> malcolm remained for a quarter of an hour chatting with the woman abouther brother and then promising to call again the next day in theevening to be introduced to her husband he rejoined ronald who had beenwaiting at the corner of the lane and had been fidgeting with impatienceat the long interview between malcolm and the woman</s> what have you been talking about all this time malcolm and what couldyou have to say to a stranger</s> i have been telling her all about her brother pierre pitou of thetouraine regiment and how he distinguished himself at dettingen andwill surely be made a sergeant with a hope some day of getting to be acaptain</s>  i have quite won her heart</s> but who is pierre pitou and when did you know him</s>  ronald askedsurprised</s> he is a tall man with broad shoulders and a scar over his left eyemalcolm said laughing and he then related the whole conversation</s> but why did you pretend to this poor woman that you knew her brother</s> because she may be very useful to us ronald and if you cant find afriend in court its just as well to have one near court</s>  she is agossiping woman and like enough she may know some of the lay sisterswho are in fact the servants of the convent and come out to buysupplies of food and other things and who distribute the alms among thepoor</s>  i dont know what advantage will come of it yet ronald but i cansee i have done a great stroke of business and feel quite an affectionfor my friend pierre pitou</s> malcolm followed up the acquaintance he had made and soon establishedhimself as a friend of the family</s>  ronald did not accompany him on any ofhis visits for as the plan of proceeding was still undecided he andmalcolm agreed that it was better that he should not show himself untilsome favourable opportunity offered</s> sometimes towards evening he and malcolm would take a boat and float downthe stream past the convent walls and ronald would wonder which of thefigures whose heads he could perceive as they walked upon the terracewas that of his mother</s>  it was not until malcolm had become quite at homewith madame vipon that he again turned the conversation towards theconvent</s>  he learned that she had often been inside the walls for beforeher marriage she had worked at a farm whence the convent drew a portionof its supplies milk butter and eggs and she had often carriedbaskets to the convent</s> of course i never went beyond the outer court she said but farmermirons daughter  it was he owned the farm  is a lay sister there</s> she was crossed in love poor girl</s>  she liked andre the son of aneighbouring farmer but it was but a small place by the side of that ofmiron and her father would not hear of it but wanted her to marryjacques dubois the rich miller who was old enough to be her father</s> andre went to the wars and was killed and instead of changing when thenews came as her father expected and taking up with the miller shehated him worse than ever and said that he was the cause of andresdeath so the long and short of it was she came as a lay sister to theconvent here</s>  of course she never thought of taking the vows for to dothat here one must be noble and be able to pay a heavy dowry to theconvent</s> so she is just a lay sister a sort of servant you know but she is afavourite and often goes to market for them and when she does shegenerally drops in here for a few minutes for a talk for though she wasonly a child when i was at the farm we were great friends and she hearsfrom me how all the people she used to know are getting on</s> i suppose she knows all the ladies who reside in the convent as well asthe sisters</s> oh yes and much better than the sisters</s>  it is on them she waits</s>  shedoes not see much of the sisters who keep to their own side of thehouse and have very little to do with the visitors or as one might callthem the prisoners for that is what most of them really are</s> now i think of it malcolm said one of the officers i served underhad a relation a lady whom i have heard him say when he was talking toanother officer is shut up here either because she wouldnt marry someone her father didnt want her to i forget exactly what it was now</s>  letme see what was her name</s>  elise  no that wasnt it</s>  amelie  ameliede recambours  yes that was it</s> oh yes i know the name</s>  i have heard jeanne speak of her</s>  jeanne saidit was whispered among them that she had really married somebody againsther fathers will</s>  at any rate she has been there ever so many years andthey have not made her take the veil as they do most of them if they areobstinate and wont give way</s>  poor thing</s>  jeanne says she is very prettystill though she must be nearly forty now</s> that is very interesting malcolm said and if you will not mindmadam vipon i will write to the officer of whom i spoke and tell him hiscousin is alive and well</s>  i was his servant in the regiment and i knowfrom what i have heard him say he was very much attached to her</s>  therecan be no harm in that you know he said as madam vipon lookeddoubtful but if you would prefer it of course i will not say how ihave heard</s> yes that will be better she agreed</s>  there is never any saying howthings come round and though theres no harm in what i have told youstill its ill gossiping about what takes place inside convent walls</s> i quite agree with you my dear madam vipon and admire your discretion</s> it is singular how you take after your brother</s>  pierre pitou had thereputation of being the most discreet man in the regiment of touraine</s> ronald was very excited when he heard from malcolm that he had actuallyobtained news at second hand as to his mother and it was with difficultythat his friend persuaded him to allow matters to go on as he proposed</s> it will never do to hurry things now ronald everything is turning outbeyond our expectations</s>  a fortnight ago it seemed absolutely hopelessthat you should communicate with your mother now things are in a goodtrain for it</s> accordingly malcolm made no further allusion to the subject to madamevipon until a fortnight had passed then he said on calling on her onedaydo you know my dear madam vipon i have had a letter from the gentlemanof whom i was speaking to you</s>  he is full of gratitude at the news i senthim</s>  i did not tell him from whom i had heard the news save that it wasfrom one of the kindest of women the sister of an old comrade of mine</s> he has sent me this  and he took out a small box which he opened andshowed a pretty gold broach with earrings to match  and bid me togive it in his name to the person who had sent him this good news</s> that is beautiful madam vipon said clapping her hands and i have sooften wished for a real gold broach</s>  wont my husband open his eyes whenhe sees them</s> i think if i might advise my dear madam malcolm said i should notgive him the exact history of them</s>  he might take it into his head thatyou had been gossiping although there is no woman in the world lessgiven to gossiping than you are</s>  still you know what husbands are</s> therefore if i were you i would tell him that your brother pierre hadsent them to you through me knowing you see that you could not haveread a letter even if he could have written one</s> yes perhaps that would be the best madam vipon said but you hadbetter write to pierre and tell him</s>  otherwise when he comes home and myhusband thanks him for them he might say he had never sent them andthere would be a nice affair</s> i will do so malcolm said but in any case i am sure your wit wouldhave come to the rescue and you would have said that you had in factbought them from your savings but that thinking your husband mightgrumble at your little economies you had thought it best to say that theycame from your brother</s> oh fie monsieur i am afraid you are teaching me to tell stories</s> that is a very hard word my dear madam</s>  you know as well as i do thatwithout a little management on both sides husbands and wives would neverget on well together but now i want to tell you more</s>  not only does myold master write to say how glad he is to hear of his cousins welfarebut he has told me a great deal more about the poor lady and knowingyour kindness of heart i do not hesitate to communicate the contents ofhis letter to you</s>  the countess amelie de recambours was secretly marriedto a young officer a great friend of my late master and her father didnot discover it until after the birth of a child  a boy</s>  then she wasshut up here</s>  the father got the boy safely away to scotland but he hasnow come back to france</s>  i do not suppose the poor lady has ever heard ofher little son since and it would be an act of kindness and mercy to lether know that he is alive and well</s> yes indeed poor creature madame vipon said sympathetically</s>  only tothink of being separated from your husband and never hearing of yourchild for all these years</s> i knew your tender heart would sympathize with her malcolm said sheis indeed to be pitied</s> and what became of her husband</s> i fancy he died years ago but my master says nothing about him</s>  he onlywrites of the boy who it seems is so delighted with the news about hismother that he is coming here to see if it is possible to have aninterview with her</s> but it is not possible madam vipon exclaimed</s>  how can he see hershut up as she is in that convent</s> yes it is difficult malcolm agreed but nothing is impossible mydear madam when a woman of heart like yourself takes a matter in handand i rely i can tell you greatly on your counsel as to your goodwilli am assured of that beforehand</s> but it is quite quite quite impossible i assure you my good monsieuranderson</s> well let us see</s>  now i know that you would suggest that the firstmeasure to be taken is to open communication between mother and son andthere i heartily agree with you</s> that would be the first thing of course monsieur but how is that to bedone</s> now that is where i look to you madam</s>  your friend jeanne waits uponher you see and i know your quick wit will already have perceived thatjeanne might deliver a message</s>  i am sure that she would never be yourfriend had she not a warm heart like your own and it will need verylittle persuasion on your part when you have told her this sad story toinduce her to bring gladness to this unfortunate lady</s> yes but think of the consequences monsieur anderson think what wouldhappen if it were found out</s> yes if there were any talk of the countess running away from theconvent i would not on any condition ask you to assist in such a matterbut what is this  merely to give a message a few harmless words</s> but you said an interview monsieur anderson</s> an interview only if it is possible my dear madam that is quiteanother matter and you know you said that it was quite impossible</s>  allthat we want now is just a little message a message by word of mouthwhich not even the keenest eye can discover or prevent there can be noharm in that</s> no i dont think there can be much harm in that madam vipon agreedat any rate i will talk to jeanne</s>  it will be her day for going tomarket tomorrow i will tell her the story of the poor lady and i thinki can answer beforehand that she will do everything she can</s> the following afternoon malcolm again saw madam vipon who told him thatalthough she had not actually promised she had no doubt jeanne woulddeliver the message</s> she will be out again on saturday monsieur at nine in the morning andif you will be here with the boy if he has arrived by that time youshall speak to her</s> at the time appointed malcolm with ronald attired now as a young frenchgentleman arrived at the house of madam vipon who was warmly thanked byronald for the interest she had taken in him</s> my friend here has spoken to me in the highest terms of you madamvipon and i am sure that all that he has said is no more than thetruth</s> i am sure i will do all i can replied madam vipon who was greatlytaken by ronalds appearance and manner its a cruel thing separating amother from a son so many years and after all what i am doing is nohanging matter anyway</s> a few minutes later jeanne entered she was a pleasant looking woman offive or six and twenty and even her sombre attire as a lay sister failedto give a formal look to her merry face</s> so these are the gentlemen who want me to become a conspirator shesaid and to run the risk of all sorts of punishment and penalties formeddling in their business</s> not so much my business as the business of my mother ronald said</s>  youwho have such true heart of your own for madam has told us something ofyour story will i am sure feel for that poor lady shut up for fifteenyears and knowing not whether her child is dead or alive</s>  if we couldbut see each other for five minutes think what joy it would be to herwhat courage her poor heart would take</s> see each other</s>  jeanne repeated surprised</s>  you said nothing aboutthat francoise you only said take a message</s>  how can they possibly seeeach other</s>  thats a different thing altogether</s> i want you to take a message first ronald said</s>  if nothing more canbe done that will be very much but i cannot think but that you and mymother between you will be able to hit upon some plan by which we mightmeet</s> but how jeanne asked in perplexity how could it possibly be</s> for example ronald suggested could i not come in as a lay sister</s>  iam not much taller than you and could pass very well as a girl</s> jeanne burst our laughing</s> you do not know what you are saying monsieur it would be altogetherimpossible</s>  people do not get taken on as lay sisters in the convent ofour lady unless they are known besides in other ways it would bealtogether impossible and even if it were not it might be years beforeyou could get to speak to the countess for there are only two or threeof us who ever enter the visitors rooms and lastly if you were foundout i dont know what would be done to both of us</s>  no that would neverdo at all</s> well in the next place i could climb on to the river terrace at nightand perhaps she could come and speak to me there</s> that is more possible jeanne said thoughtfully but all the doors arelocked up at night</s> but she might get out of a window ronald urged with a rope laddershe could get down and then return again and none be the wiser</s> jeanne sat silent for a minute and then she asked suddenlyare you telling me all monsieur or are you intending that the countessshall escape with you</s> no indeed on my honour</s>  ronald exclaimed</s>  i have nowhere where icould take my mother</s>  she would be pursued and brought back and herposition would be far worse than it is now</s>  no i swear to you that ionly want to see her and to speak to her and i have nothing elsewhatever in my mind</s> i believe you monsieur jeanne said gravely</s>  had it been otherwise idare not have helped for my punishment if i was discovered to have aidedin an escape from the convent would be terrible  terrible</s>  sherepeated with a shudder</s>  as to the other i will risk it for a gentlerand kinder lady i have never met</s>  and yet i am sure she must be veryvery brave to have remained firm for so many years</s>  at any rate i willgive her your message</s> ronald took from a small leather bag which he wore round his neck atiny gold chain with a little cross</s> i had this round my neck when i was taken away as a child to scotland</s> no doubt she put it there and will recognize it</s>  say to her only hewhom you have not seen since he was an infant is in tours longing aboveall things to speak to you that is all my message</s>  afterwards if youwill you can tell her what we have said and how i long to see her</s>  howhigh is her room from the ground</s>  because if it is high it will be betterthat i should climb to her window than that she should descend andascend again</s> jeanne shook her head</s> that could not be she said</s>  the visitors have all separate cells butthe partitions do not go up to the ceiling and even if you entered nota word could be spoken without being overheard</s>  but fortunately she is onthe first floor and i am sure she is not one to shrink from so little amatter as the descent of a ladder in order to have an interview with herson</s> that same afternoon as amelie de recambours was proceeding from therefectory to her cell following several of her fellow captives herattendant jeanne came out from one of the cells</s>  glancing behind to seethat no one was following she put her finger on her lips and thenwhispered make some excuse not to go into the garden with the othersthis evening</s>  it is most important</s>  then she glided back into the roomfrom which she had come</s> the countess followed the others in a state of almost bewilderment</s>  forsixteen years nothing had occurred to break the monotony of herexistence</s>  at first occasional angry messages reached her from herfather with orders to join an application to the pope for a divorce butwhen it had been found impossible to overcome her steady refusals themessages had at last ceased and for years no word from the outer worldhad reached her although she had learned from those who from time totime came to share her captivity what was passing outside</s>  whether herhusband was alive or dead she knew not</s>  they had told her over and overagain that he was dead but the fact that she had never had the optiongiven her of accepting another husband or taking the final vows kept hopealive</s>  for she was convinced that if he was really dead efforts would bemade to compel her to marry again</s> what then she wondered to herself could this communication so secretlygiven mean</s>  she regarded the lay sister who attended upon her as a happylooking young woman whose face was in strong contrast to most of thosewithin the walls of the convent but she had exchanged but few words withher knowing that she would be but a short time about her</s>  for the policyof the abbess was to change the attendants upon the ladies in theircharge frequently in order to prevent them from being tampered with orpersuaded into conveying communications without the walls</s> you look pale amelie one of the other ladies said as they gathered ina group for a moment before proceeding to their respective apartmentswhere they were supposed to pass the afternoon in working reading andmeditation</s> it is the heat the countess said</s>  i have a headache</s> you look it the latter said</s>  it is not often that you have anythingthe matter with you</s>  you know we all say that you must have aconstitution of iron and the courage of a roland to be sixteen years hereand yet to have no wrinkle on your forehead no marks of weeping roundyour eyes</s> the countess smiled sadly</s> i wept the first six months almost without ceasing and then i toldmyself that if i would be strong and resist i must weep no more</s>  if abird in a cage once takes to pining he is sure not to live long</s>  thereare few of us here the news of whose death would not give pleasure tothose who shut us up and i for one resolved that i would live in spiteof all</s> well you must not get ill now amelie</s>  we should miss you terribly inthe one hour of the day when we really live the hour when we walk andtalk and laugh if we can on the river terrace</s> i dont think i shall be able to come this evening the countess said</s> i shall lie down and keep myself quiet</s>  tomorrow i hope to be myselfagain</s>  it is a mere passing indisposition</s> the hours passed slowly as amelie lay on her couch and wondered over thecoming interview</s>  there were so many things which she might hear  thather father was dead that her family had hopes at last of obtaining herrestoration to the world</s>  that it could be a message from her husband shehad no hope for so long as her father lived she was sure that hisrelease would never be granted</s>  as to the child she scarce gave it athought</s>  that it had somehow been removed and had escaped the search thathad been made for it she was aware for attempts had been made to obtainfrom her some clue as to where it would most likely have been taken</s>  shewas convinced that it had never been found for if it had she would haveheard of it</s>  it would have been used as a lever to work upon her</s> at last the hour when she was accustomed to go into the garden arrivedand as the convent bell struck seven she heard the doors of the othercells open the sound of feet in the corridor and then all became still</s> in a few minutes a step approached and one of the sisters entered toinquire why she was not in the garden with the others</s> she repeated that her head ached</s> you look pale the sister said and your hand is hot and feverish</s>  iwill send you up some tisane</s>  it is the heat no doubt</s>  i think that weare going to have thunder</s> in a few minutes a step was again heard approaching and jeanne enteredwith the medicament</s>  as she closed the door the countess started into asitting position</s> what is it jeanne</s>  what is it that you have to say to me</s> calm yourself i pray you countess jeanne said</s>  for both our sakes ipray you to hear what i have to say calmly</s>  i expect sister felicia willbe here directly</s>  when she heard you were unwell she said she would comeup and see what you needed</s>  and now i will begin my message</s>  in thefirst place i was to hand you this</s>  and she placed in amelies hand thelittle necklet and cross</s> for a moment the countess looked at them wonderingly and then thereflashed across her memory a sturdy child in its nurses arms and a tallman looking on with a loving smile as she fastened a tiny gold chainround the childs neck</s>  a low cry burst from her lips as she started toher feet</s> hush lady hush</s>  jeanne exclaimed</s>  this is my message he whom youhave not seen since he was an infant is in tours longing above allthings to speak to you</s> my child</s>  my child</s>  the countess cried</s>  alive and here</s>  my god ithank thee that thou hast remembered a friendless mother at last</s>  haveyou seen him jeanne</s>  what is he like</s>  oh tell me everything</s> he is a right proper young gentleman madam</s>  straight and comely andtall with brown waving hair and a bright pleasant face</s>  a son such asany mother might be proud of</s> the countess suddenly threw her arms around jeannes neck and burst intotears</s> you have made me so happy jeanne happy as i never thought to be again</s> how can i thank you</s> the best way at present madam jeanne said with a smile will be bydrinking up that tisane and lying down quietly</s>  sister felicia movesabout as noiselessly as a cat and she may pop in at any moment</s>  do youlie down again and i will stand a little way off talking</s>  then if shecomes upon us suddenly she will suspect nothing</s> the countess seized the bowl of tisane and drank it off and then threwherself on the couch</s> go on jeanne go on</s>  have pity on my impatience</s>  think how i am longingto hear of him</s>  did the message say he was longing to see me</s>  but that isnot possible</s> it is not quite impossible madam though it would be dangerous verydangerous</s>  still it is not quite impossible</s> how then could it be done jeanne</s>  you know what our life is here</s>  howcan i possibly see my boy</s> what he proposes madam is this that he should some night scale theriver wall and await you on the terrace and that you should descendfrom your window by a rope ladder and so return after seeing him</s> oh yes that is possible</s>  the countess exclaimed i could knot my bedclothes and slide down</s>  it matters not about getting back again since wehave no ladder</s> i can manage to bring in two light ropes jeanne said</s>  it would not dofor you to be found in the garden for it would excite suspicion and youwould never have a chance of doing it again</s>  but it is not an easy thingto climb up a rope ladder with no one to help you and you know i shallbe at the other end of the house</s> that is nothing the countess said</s>  had i to climb ten times theheight do you think i should hesitate for a moment when it was to see myson</s>  oh jeanne how good you are</s>  and when will it be</s> i will bring in the ropes next time i go out</s>  mind and place them inyour bed</s>  you will know that that night at eleven oclock your son willbe on the terrace awaiting you</s> as jeanne finished speaking she placed her finger on her lips for shethought she heard a slight noise without</s>  the countess closed her eyesand then lay down on her pillow while jeanne stood as if watching her</s> the next instant the door opened noiselessly and sister felicia entered</s> she moved with a noiseless step up to jeanne</s> is she asleep</s>  she whispered</s> oh no</s>  jeanne answered in a louder voice guessing that the sisterwould have heard the murmur of voices</s>  she has only just closed hereyes</s> the countess looked up</s> ah</s>  is it you sister</s>  i have taken the tisane sister angela sent upbut my hands are burning and my head aches</s>  the heat in chapel was sogreat i thought i should have fainted</s> your hands are indeed burning the sister said convinced as soon asshe touched them that the countess was really indisposed</s>  yes and yourpulse is beating quicker than i can count</s>  yes you have a touch offever</s>  i will mix you a draught and bring it up to you at once</s>  hark</s> that is the first peal of thunder we are going to have a storm</s>  it willclear the air and do you even more good than my medicine</s>  i will leaveyou here for tonight if you are not better tomorrow we will move youinto the infirmary</s> the next morning sister felicia found her patient much better though shestill seemed languid and weak and was ordered to remain quietly in herapartment for a day or so which was just what she desired for she wasso filled with her new born happiness that she feared that if she wentabout her daily tasks as usual she should not be able to conceal from thesharp eyes of the sisters the joyousness which was brimming over in herwhile had she laughed she would have astonished the inmates of the gloomyconvent</s> chapter vii mother</s> when jeanne after accomplishing her errands the next time she went outentered madam vipons she found ronald and malcolm awaiting her</s> you have told my mother</s>  the former asked eagerly as she entered</s> yes i have told her and if i had been an angel from heaven with aspecial message to her the poor lady could not have looked more happy</s> and you have been like an angel to us</s>  ronald exclaimed taking herhand</s>  how can i thank you for your goodness</s> for shame sir</s>  jeanne said smiling and colouring as ronald in hisdelight threw his arms round her and kissed her</s>  remember i am a laysister</s> i could not have helped it ronald said if you had been the ladysuperior</s>  and now he went on eagerly is all arranged</s>  see i havebrought a ladder of silk rope light and thin but quite strong enough tobear her</s> you take all for granted then sir</s>  you know i said i would take yourmessage but that i would not engage to meddle further in it</s> i know you said so but i was sure that having gone so far you would dothe rest</s>  you will wont you jeanne</s> i suppose i must jeanne said for what with the countess on one sideand you on the other i should get no peace if i said no</s>  well then itis all arranged</s>  at eleven oclock tonight you are to be on the terraceand you can expect her there</s>  if she does not come you will know thatsomething has occurred to prevent her and she will come the followingnight at the same hour</s>
jeanne took the silken cords and wound them round her under her laysisters robe and then with a kindly nod at ronald and an injunctionto be as noiseless as a mouse in climbing up the terrace and above allnot to raise his voice in speaking to his mother she tripped away acrossthe street to the convent</s> malcolm and ronald sallied out from tours before the city gates wereclosed at sunset and sat down on the slope which rises from the otherside of the river and waited till it was time to carry the plan intooperation</s>  gradually the lights disappeared from the various windows andthe sounds which came across the water ceased and by ten oclockeverything was profoundly still</s>  they had in the course of theafternoon hired a boat saying they were going out for a nightsfishing</s>  this they had moored a short distance below the town on theside of the river where they now were</s>  they now made their way to it androwed quietly across the stream then they left it and waded through thewater which flowed knee deep at the foot of the walls</s> although tours was still a walled town the habit of keeping sentry intime of peace had long since died out and they had no fear at thathour of discovery</s>  there was no moon but the night was bright andclear and they had no difficulty in finding that part of the wall whichnow formed the terrace of the convent</s> they were provided with a rope knotted at every foot and with a grapnelattached to one end</s>  at the second attempt this caught on the parapet ofthe wall and ronald at once climbed it and stood on the terrace wherea minute later he was joined by malcolm</s>  the convent itself could not beseen for a screen of trees at the foot of the wall shut it off from theview of people on the opposite bank of the river</s>  they waited quietlyuntil a sudden peal of the bells of the numerous churches announced thatit was the hour</s>  then they moved towards the steps leading down into thegarden</s>  a minute later a figure was seen approaching</s>  malcolm fell backand ronald advanced towards it</s>  as the countess approached she held ourher arms exclaimingmy boy my boy</s>  and with a cry of mother</s>  ronald sprang forward intoher embrace</s> for a short time not a word was spoken and then the countess murmuredmy god i thank thee for this great happiness</s>  and now my son shesaid recovering herself tell me everything</s>  first have you news ofyour father</s> alas no</s>  ronald said</s>  nothing has been heard of him since the fatalday when he was seized but i am convinced that he is still alive andsince i have found you surely i shall be able to find him</s> who is that with you ronald</s> that is malcolm anderson it is to him i owe everything</s>  he carried meoff and took me away with him to scotland the day my father was arrested</s> he has been my best friend ever since and it is he who brought me hereto you</s> the countess advanced to malcolm</s> my son has told me that we owe everything to you my brave malcolm</s>  shesaid holding out her hand</s>  i guessed that it was to you that my husbandhad confided the care of the child when i learned that it haddisappeared</s>  i remember what confidence he had in your devotion and howhe confided everything to you</s> he was like a brother to me madam malcolm replied and glad indeedam i that i have been able to befriend his son and to bring him back toyou a gentleman who will be an honour even to his fathers name andyours</s> and now let us sit down here the countess said taking a seat upon abench</s>  it gets light very early and you must not stay after twooclock and there is so much for me to hear</s> for the next two hours ronald sat holding his mothers hand while hetold her the story of his life</s>  and now mother he said when he hadconcluded we have but an hour left for it has just struck one and wehave not said a word yet about the principal thing of all</s>  how are we toobtain your freedom</s>  cannot you arrange to escape with us</s>  i do not ofcourse mean tonight for we have nothing prepared and moreover ipromised jeanne that there should be no attempt at escape but we cancome again when everything is ready</s>  we shall of course need a disguisefor you for there will be a hot pursuit when your escape is known</s>  butwe might manage to reach the coast and cross over to england and so makeour way north</s> no my son the countess said</s>  i have thought it over in every waysince i knew you were here and i am resolved to remain here</s>  were i tofly the last hope that your father might be freed would be lost</s>  myfather would be more than ever incensed against him and me andmoreover although that is but a minor consideration there would be nohope whatever of your ever recovering the rank and estate to which youare entitled</s>  no i am resolved to wait here at any rate so long as myfather lives</s>  at his death doubtless there will be some change for asheiress to his estates my existence must be in some way recognized andmy family may be enabled to obtain my release when his powerfulopposition is removed if not it will be time to take the idea of flightinto consideration till then i remain here</s>  now that i have seen younow that i know you as you are for i can just make out your face by thelight of the stars i shall be as near contentment and happiness as i canbe till i meet your father again</s>  in the meantime your good friend herecan advise you far better than i can as to what your course had betterbe</s>  if you can obtain any high influence use it for obtaining yourfathers release</s>  if it be accompanied by a sentence of exile from franceit matters not so that he is freed</s>  you can then return here and i willgladly fly with you to join him in scotland</s> malcolm now rose from his seat and left mother and son half an hourtogether</s>  when two oclock struck he returned to them</s> there is the signal the countess said rising and now we must part</s> she had already refused to accede to ronalds entreaty that she wouldmeet him there again</s> no my son we have been permitted to meet this once but we must nottempt fortune again</s>  sooner or later something would be sure to occurwhich would lead to discovery and bring ruin upon all our plans</s>  it ishard to say no and to refuse the chance of seeing you again now that wehave come together but i am fully resolved that i will not risk it</s> we will see you safe up the ladder mother ronald said</s>  it is no easymatter to climb up a rope ladder swinging loosely</s> no i discovered that in descending the countess said but if youcome with me you must take off your boots  the print of a mansfootstep in the garden would ruin us all and mind not a word must bespoken when we have once left the terrace</s> taking off their boots they accompanied her through the garden</s>  there wasa last passionate embrace at the foot of the ladder then the countessmounted it while they held it steady</s>  directly she entered the window sheundid the fastening of the rope inside and let the ladder drop down tothem</s>  five minutes later ronald descended the rope into the river</s> malcolm shifted the grapnel so that it caught only on the edge of theparapet and could be shaken off from below when the strain on the ropewas removed then he slid down to ronalds side</s>  a sharp jerk broughtdown the grapnel and they returned along the edge of the river as theyhad come crossed in the boat and waited for morning</s> they waited two days longer in tours in order that they might receivethrough jeanne from the countess a list of the noble families to whichshe was related with notes as to those persons of whom she had seen mostbefore her marriage and who she believed would be most disposed to exerttheir influence on her behalf</s> jeanne ronald said i am troubled that i do not know what i can do toshow you how grateful i am</s>  i should so like to give you some souvenirbut what can i do  you could not wear brooches or earrings ortrinkets</s> that i could not monsieur jeanne broke in with a smile and if icould i would not accept them from you</s>  i have done what i have donebecause i pitied your mother and you and i am content that if i havebroken the rules i have done it with a good purpose</s> well jeanne ronald said you may not be a lay sister all your lifeyou have taken no vows that will bind you for ever and i have no doubtthat the lady superior can absolve you from your engagements should youat any time wish to go back to the world if so and if i am still infrance i will come to dance at your wedding and will promise you aspretty a necklace and earrings as are to be found in touraine</s> very well that is a bargain jeanne said laughing and it is notimpossible young sir that some day i may hold you to your promise foronly last market day i met my father and he spoke more kindly to me thanhe used to and even said that he missed me and i hear that the millerhas found someone who will put up with him for the sake of his money</s>  ishouldnt be surprised if when that comes off father wants me homeagain but i shant go directly he asks me you may be sure but shallbargain that if there be again any question of a husband it will be forme to decide and not him</s> the next day ronald and his companion started for paris</s>  they were highlygratified with the success which had attended them and ronald felt hiswhole life brightened now that he had found the mother who had been solong lost to him</s>  on arriving at paris they found that colonel humesregiment had returned to the capital</s>  it was not expected that therewould at present be any further fighting on the frontier and two orthree of the scotch regiments had been brought back</s>  ronald at oncecalled on colonel hume and related to him the success which had attendedthe first portion of his undertaking</s> i congratulate you indeed colonel hume said</s>  i own that i thoughtyour enterprise was a hopeless one for it seemed to me impossible thatyou should be able to obtain an interview with a lady closely imprisonedin a convent</s>  why anderson it is plain now that your talents have beenlost and that you ought to have been a diplomatist instead of wastingyour time as a soldier</s>  the way you carried out your plan was indeedadmirable and i shall really begin to think that ronald will yetsucceed and now my young friend what do you mean to do next</s> would it be possible sir to ascertain where my father is confined</s> i think not my lad the colonel said gravely</s>  in addition to the fouror five prisons in paris there are a score of others in different partsof france</s>  the names of the prisoners in each are known only to thegovernors to all others within the walls they exist as numbers only</s>  thegovernors themselves are sworn to secrecy and even if we could get atone or two of them which would be difficult enough we could hope for nomore</s>  nor would it be much satisfaction to you merely to know in whichprison your father is lying for it is a very different matter tocommunicate with a prisoner in one of the royal fortresses to passing amessage to a lady detained in a convent</s>  i can see nothing for you but tofollow the example of your mother and to practise patience so conductingyourself as to gain friends and make a name and influence so that atyour grandfathers death we may bring as strong a pressure as possible tobear upon the king</s> how old is my grandfather</s>  ronald asked</s> he is a man about sixty</s> why he may live twenty years yet</s>  ronald exclaimed bitterly</s> do not look at the worst side of the question colonel hume repliedwith a smile</s>  but he may live some years he went on more gravely andin the meantime you must think what you had better do</s>  i will tell you asa great secret that it has been finally resolved that an expeditionshall sail this winter for scotland and fifteen thousand troops willassemble at dunkirk under marshal saxe</s>  nothing could be more opportune</s> we are to form part of the expedition with several other scottishregiments</s>  you are too young as yet for me to ask for a commission foryou but if you like i will enroll you as a gentleman volunteer in thisway you may have an opportunity of distinguishing yourself</s>  i willintroduce you to the chevalier and it may be that if he succeeds ingaining the crown of scotland if not of england he will himself askking louis as a personal favour to release and restore to him colonelleslie of glenlyon who fought bravely with him in 15</s>  if the expeditionfails and we get back alive to france i will then obtain for you acommission in the regiment and we can carry out our plan as we arranged</s> what do you say to that</s> i thank you greatly sir and accept your offer most gratefully</s>  i seethat i am powerless to do anything for my father now and your plan givesat least a prospect of success</s>  in any case nothing will give me so muchdelight as to serve with the regiment he formerly commanded and under sokind a friend as yourself</s> that is settled then colonel hume said and now about outfit</s>  agentleman volunteer wears the uniform of the officers of the regimentand indeed is one in all respects except that he draws no pay</s>  my pursewill be at your disposal</s>  do not show any false modesty my lad aboutaccepting help from me</s>  your father would have shared his last penny withme had i needed it</s> i thank you heartily colonel for your offer and should it benecessary i will avail myself of it but at present i have ample funds</s> malcolm carried off with me a bag with a hundred louis and up to the daywhen i landed in france these had never been touched</s>  i have eighty ofthem still remaining which will provide my outfit and my maintenance fora long time to come</s> there is another advantage in your being a volunteer rather than on thelist of officers ronald in that if it is necessary at any time youcan after a word with me lay aside your uniform and go about youraffairs as long as you choose without question which would be hard to doif you belonged regularly to the regiment</s> at the end of a week ronald had procured his uniform and was presentedby the colonel to the officers of the regiment as ronald leslie the sonof an old friend of his who was joining the regiment as a gentlemanvolunteer</s>  malcolm joined only in the capacity of ronalds servant</s>  itwas painful to the lad that his old friend and protector should assumesuch a relation towards him but malcolm laughed at his scruples</s> my dear ronald he said i was your fathers servant and yet hisfriend</s>  why should i not act in the same capacity to you</s>  as to theduties they are so light that now i do not belong to the regiment myonly difficulty will be to kill time</s>  there is nothing to do save topolish up your arms and your equipment</s>  your horse will be looked afterby a trooper so long as you are with the regiment</s>  i shall call you inthe morning get your cup of chocolate and prepare your dinner when youdo not dine abroad carry your messages when you have any messages tosend and escort you when you go about any business in which it ispossible that a second sword would be of use to you</s>  as i have said theonly trouble will be to know what to do with myself when you do not wantme</s> it was now the end of august and for the next four months ronald workedhard at drill</s>  he soon became a general favourite with the officers</s>  thefact that his name was leslie and that he was accompanied by malcolmwho was known to many of the old soldiers as being devoted to theirformer colonel and as having in some strange way disappeared from theregiment at the same time gave ground to a general surmise that lesliewas the colonels son</s> malcolm himself when questioned neither denied nor acknowledged thefact but turned it off with a joke and a laugh</s>  he was soon as much athome in his old regiment as if he formed a part in it and when notrequired by ronald passed the greater part of his time with his formercomrades</s>  as was natural the opinion entertained by the men as toleslies identity was shared by the officers</s>  the avoidance by ronald ofany allusion to his family his declining when he first came among themto say to which branch of the leslies he belonged and the decided mannerin which colonel hume the first time the question was broached in hishearing in ronalds absence said that he begged no inquiries would bemade on that score all he could assure them was that leslies father wasa gentleman of good family and a personal friend of his own  put astop to all further questioning but strengthened the idea that had gotabroad that the young volunteer was the son of colonel leslie</s> early in january the 2d scottish dragoons marched for dunkirk wheretwenty thousand men assembled while a large number of men of war andtransports were gathered in the port</s>  one day when ronald was walking inthe street with malcolm at his heels the latter stepped up to him andtouched him</s> do you see that officer in the uniform of a colonel of the blackmusketeers in that group at the opposite corner look at him well forhe is your fathers greatest enemy and would be yours if he knew who youare that is the duke de chateaurouge</s> ronald gazed at the man who had exercised so evil an influence upon thefate of his parents</s>  he was a tall dark man with a pointed moustache andof from forty to fortyfive years of age</s>  his features were regular andhandsome but in his thin straight eyebrows the curl of his lips and acertain supercilious drooping of the eyelids ronald read the evilpassions which rendered him so dangerous and implacable an enemy</s> so that is the duke</s>  ronald said when he had passed on</s>  i did not knowhe was a soldier</s> he is an honorary colonel of the regiment and only does duty when it iscalled on active service but he served in it for some years as a youngman and had the reputation of being a good soldier though i know thathe was considered a harsh and unfeeling officer by the men who servedunder him</s>  that is the man ronald and if you could get six inches ofyour sword between his ribs it would go a good long way towards obtainingyour fathers release but i warn you he is said to be one of the bestswordsmen in france</s> i care not how good a swordsmen he is ronald said hotly if i do butget a fair chance</s> dont do anything rash ronald i have no fear about your swordsmanshipfor i know in the last four months you have practised hard and thatfrancois says that young as you are you could give a point to any officerin the regiment</s>  but at present it were madness to quarrel with the dukeyou have everything to lose and nothing to gain</s>  if he killed you therewould be an end of you and your plans if you killed him you would haveto fly the country for a court favourite is not to be slain with as muchimpunity as a bourgeois and equally would there be an end of all hope ofobtaining your fathers release</s> no for the present you must be content to bide your time</s>  still it isas well for you to know your foe when you see him and in the meantime goon frequenting the various schools of arms and learn every trick of thesword that is to be taught</s>  look</s>  he went on as a group of mountedofficers rode down the street that is marshal saxe one of the bestsoldiers in france if not the best and just as wild and reckless inprivate life as he is calm and prudent as a general</s> ronald looked with some surprise at the great general</s>  he had expected tosee a dashing soldier</s>  he saw a man who looked worn and bent withdisease and as if scarce strong enough to sit on his horse but therewas still a fire in his eye and as he uttered a joke to an officerriding next to him and joined merrily in the laugh it was evident thathis spirit was untouched by the disease which had made a wreck of hisbody</s> a few days later a messenger arrived with the news that the french fleetfrom brest had sailed and had met the english fleet which had gone offin pursuit of it and the coast of kent was in consequence unguarded</s> orders were instantly given that the troops should embark on board thetransports and as fast as these were filled they set sail</s>  theembarkation of the cavalry naturally took longer time than that of theinfantry and before the scottish dragoons had got their horses on boarda portion of the fleet was already out of sight</s> was there ever such luck</s>  malcolm exclaimed after assisting in gettingthe horses on board a by no means easy task as the vessel was rollingheavily at her mooring</s>  the wind is rising every moment and blowingstraight into the harbour unless i mistake not there will be no sailingtonight</s> this was soon evident to all</s>  signals were made from ship to ship freshanchors were let down and the topmast housed</s>  by midnight it was blowinga tremendous gale which continued for three days</s>  several of thetransports dragged their anchors and were washed ashore and messagesarrived from different parts of the coast telling of the wreck of many ofthose which had sailed before the storm set in</s> the portion of the fleet which had sailed had indeed been utterlydispersed by the gale</s>  many ships were lost and the rest shattered anddismantled arrived at intervals at the various french ports</s>  the blowwas too heavy to be repaired</s>  the english fleet had again returned to thecoast and were on the lookout to intercept the expedition and as thiswas now reduced to a little more than half of its original strength nosurprise was felt when the plan was abandoned altogether</s> marshal saxe with a portion of the troops marched to join the army inflanders and the scotch dragoons were ordered to return to paris for thepresent</s> for a year ronald remained with the regiment in paris</s>  he had during thattime been introduced by colonel hume to several members of his mothersfamily</s>  by some of these who had known her before her marriage he waskindly received but all told him that it would be hopeless to make anyefforts for the release of his father as long as the marquis derecambours remained alive and high in favour at court and that anymovement in that direction would be likely to do harm rather than good</s> some of the others clearly intimated to him that they considered that thecountess had by making a secret marriage and defying her fathersauthority forfeited all right to the assistance or sympathy of hermothers family</s> twice ronald travelled to tours and sent messages to his mother throughjeanne and received answers from the countess</s>  she had however refusedto meet him again on the terrace saying that in spite of the love shehad for him and her desire to see him again she was firmly resolved notto run the risk of danger to him and the failure of all their hopes byany rash step</s> at the end of the summer campaign in flanders marshal saxe returned toparis and colonel hume one day took ronald and introduced him to himhaving previously interested the marshal by relating his history to him</s> the marshal asked ronald many questions and was much pleased with hisfrank manner and bearing</s> you shall have any protection i can give you the marshal said</s>  no manhas loved adventures more than i nor had a fairer share of them and mysympathies are altogether with you besides i remember your father welland many a carouse have we had together in flanders</s>  but i am a soldieryou know and though the king is glad enough to employ our swords infighting his enemies we have but little influence at court</s>  i promiseyou however that after the first great victory i win i will ask therelease of your father as a personal favour from the king on the groundthat he was an old comrade of mine</s>  i can only hope for your sake thatthe marquis your grandfather may have departed this world before thattakes place for he is one of the kings prime favourites and even therequest of a victorious general would go for little as opposed to hisinfluence the other way</s>  and now if you like i will give you acommission in colonel humes regiment</s>  you have served for a year as avolunteer now and younger men than you have received commissions</s> ronald thanked the marshal most heartily for his kind promise but saidthat at present he would rather remain as a volunteer because it gavehim greater freedom of action</s> perhaps you are right the marshal said</s>  but at any rate you hadbetter abstain from attempting any steps such as colonel hume tells meyou once thought of for obtaining the release of your father</s>  successwill be all but impossible and a failure would destroy altogether anyhopes you may have of obtaining his release from the king</s> it seemed that some of his mothers family with whom he had communicatedmust have desired to gain the favour of the favourite of the king byrelating the circumstances to him for a short time after ronaldsinterview with the marshal the marquis came up to colonel hume when hewas on duty in the kings antechamber and in the presence of a numberof courtiers said to himso colonel hume i find that i have to thank you for harbouring in yourregiment an imposter who claims to be my grandson</s>  i shall know sirhow to repay the obligation</s> the gentleman in question is no imposter marquis as i have taken thepains to inform myself</s>  and i am not aware of any reason why i should notadmit the son of a scottish gentleman into my regiment even though hehappen to be a grandson of yours</s>  as to your threat sir as long as i domy duty to his majesty i fear the displeasure of no man</s> two nights later as ronald was returning from dining with colonel humeand some of his officers he was suddenly attacked in a narrow street bysix men</s>  malcolm was with him for colonel hume had at once related tohim the conversation he had had with the marquis and had warned him totake the greatest precautions</s> he is perfectly capable of having you suddenly put out of his way by astab in the back ronald</s>  and if there were anywhere for you to go ishould advise you to leave paris at once but nowhere in france would yoube safe from him and it would upset all your plans to return to scotlandat present</s>  however you cannot be too careful</s> ronald had related what had passed to malcolm who determined to watchmore carefully than ever over his safety and never left his side when hewas outside the barracks</s> the instant the six men rushed out from a lane at whose entrance alantern was dimly burning malcolms sword was out and before theassailants had time to strike a blow he had run the foremost through thebody</s> ronald instantly recovered from his surprise and also drew</s>  he was nownearly eighteen and although he had not yet gained his full height hewas a match for most men in strength while his constant exercise in theschool of arms had strengthened the muscle of his sword arm until instrength as well as in skill he could hold his own against the bestswordsman in the regiment</s>  the men were for a moment checked by the fallof their leader but then seeing that they had opposed to them only oneman and another whom they regarded as a lad scarcely to be taken intoconsideration they rushed upon them</s>  they were quickly undeceived</s> ronald parried the first blow aimed at him and with his ripostestretched his opponent on the pavement and then springing forward aftera few rapid thrusts and parries ran the next through the shoulder almostat the same moment that malcolm stretched another opponent on the ground</s> terrified at the downfall of three of their number while a fourth leanedagainst a door post disabled the two remaining ruffians took to theirheels and fled at the top of their speed the whole affair having lastedscarce a minute</s> tell your employer ronald said to the wounded man that i am not tobe disposed of so easily as he imagined</s>  i should be only giving you whatyou deserve if i were to pass my sword through your body but i disdainto kill such pitiful assassins except in self defence</s> the next morning ronald communicated to colonel hume what had happened</s> its just as well my young friend that you are going to leave paris</s>  ireceived orders half an hour ago for the regiment to march to thefrontier at once</s>  that is the marquiss doing no doubt</s>  he thought toget rid of you last night and to punish me this morning but he hasfailed both ways</s>  you have defeated his cutthroats i shall be heartilyglad to be at the front again for i am sick of this idle life in paris</s> chapter viii hidden foes</s> i am heartily glad to be out of paris ronald said to malcolm on theirfirst halt after leaving the capital</s>  it is not pleasant to regard everyman one meets after dark as a possible enemy and although i escaped scotfree from the gang who attacked us the other night one cannot alwaysexpect such good fortune as that</s>  it was a constant weight on ones mindand i feel like a new man now that we are beyond the city walls</s> nevertheless ronald we must not omit any precautions</s>  your enemy has along purse and can reach right across france</s>  that last affair is proofof his bitterness against you and it would be rash indeed were we to actas if having made one attempt and failed he would abandon his plansaltogether</s>  he is clearly a man who nourishes a grudge for years and hisfirst failure is only likely to add to his vindictive feeling</s>  i do notsay that your danger is as great as it was in paris but that is simplybecause the opportunities of attacking you are fewer</s>  i should advise youto be as careful as before and to be on your guard against ambushes andsurprises</s> well it may be so malcolm and of course i will be careful but till ihave proof to the contrary i shall prefer to think that the marquis willtrust to my being knocked on the head during the war and will make nofurther move against me until the regiment returns to paris</s> think what you like lad malcolm said so that you are cautious andguarded</s>  i shall sleep with one eye open i can tell you till we arefairly beyond the frontier</s> two days later the regiment encamped outside the town of st</s>  quentin</s> they were usually quartered on the inhabitants but the town was alreadyfilled with troops and as the weather was fine colonel hume ordered hismen to bivouac a short distance outside the walls</s>  ronald was seeing thathis troop got their breakfast next morning when a sergeant came up withtwo men with a horse</s> this is monsieur leslie he said to them</s>  these men were asking foryou sir</s> what do you want with me</s>  ronald said surprised</s> we heard sir one of the peasants said that you wanted to buy ahorse</s>  we have a fine animal here and cheap</s> but i do not want to buy one ronald replied</s>  i am very well suppliedwith horses</s>  what made you think i wanted one</s> we asked one of the officers sir if anyone in the regiment would belikely to buy and he said that monsieur leslie wanted one he believed</s> no ronald said decidedly</s>  whoever told you was mistaken</s>  i have myfull complement and though your horse looks a nice animal i could nottake him if you offered him to me for nothing</s>  i dont think you will getanyone to buy him in the regiment</s>  i believe that every officer has hisfull complement of chargers</s> in the evening ronald happened to mention to malcolm the offer he had hadin the morning</s> it was a nice looking beast he said and i had half a mind to askthem what they would take to exchange him with my roan but i did notwant to dip further into my purse</s> i wish i had been beside you at the time malcolm said earnestlythose two fellows wouldnt have gone out of the camp so easily</s> why what do you mean malcolm</s> mean</s>  malcolm repeated in a vexed tone</s>  this is what comes of yourbeing watchful and cautious ronald</s>  why the matter is clear enough</s>  themarquis has set men on your track but of course they could do nothinguntil some of them knew you by sight so two of them are sent into campwith this cock and bull story about a horse and they come and have agood look at you and go quietly off</s>  it is too provoking</s>  had i beenthere i would have given them in charge of a file of men at once</s>  then wewould have asked every officer in the regiment if he had sent them toyou and when we found as we certainly should have found that none ofthem had done so we should have marched the men off to colonel hume andi am sure when he heard the circumstances of the case they would havebeen lashed up and flogged till he had got the truth of the matter out ofthem</s>  my great hope has been that they could not very well attempt yourlife because none of the men who might be engaged on the job would belikely to know your face and they would therefore have no means ofsingling you out for attack and now two of the ruffians will be able tofollow you and watch their opportunity</s> oh nonsense malcolm you are too suspicious altogether</s>  i have nodoubt the affair was just as they stated it to be</s>  what was morenatural</s> well ronald you will meet all the other officers at supper in half anhour</s>  just ask if any of them sent two men wanting to sell a horse to youthis morning if any of them say that they did so i will acknowledge iam wrong</s> accordingly ronald at supper put the question but none of the officersadmitted they knew anything about the matter</s> you have two very good horses leslie why should anyone suppose thatyou wanted another</s>  the colonel asked</s> i dont know ronald said</s>  i only know that two men did come up with ahorse to me this morning and said that one of the officers had told themthat i wanted to buy one</s> it must have been one of the men the colonel said carelessly thoughi dont know why anyone should suppose that you wanted another charger</s> still someone knowing that you are the last joined officer might thinkyou had need for a second horse</s> the subject dropped and malcolm shook his head ominously when ronaldacknowledged to him that his suspicions were so far right that none ofthe officers had sent the men to him</s>  the next day as the regiment waspassing through a thick wood and ronald was riding with captain campbellbehind his troop which happened to be in the rear in the regiment twoshots were fired from among the trees</s>  the first struck ronalds horse inthe neck causing him to swerve sharply round a movement which saved hisriders life for the second shot which was fired almost instantly afterthe first grazed his body and passed between him and captain campbell</s> are you hit leslie</s>  the latter exclaimed for the sudden movement ofhis horse had almost unseated ronald</s> nothing serious i think</s>  the bullet has cut my coat and grazed my skini think but nothing more</s> the captain shouted orders to his men and with a score of troopersdashed into the wood</s>  the trees grew thickly and there was a denseundergrowth and they had difficulty in making their way through them</s> for half an hour they continued their search without success and thenrejoined the regiment on its march</s> this is a curious affair colonel hume said when captain campbellreported at the next halt that an attempt at assassination had takenplace</s> it looks like a premeditated attempt upon one or other of you</s>  youhavent been getting into any scrape have you</s>  he asked with a smilekissing some peasants wife or offering to run away with his daughter</s> but seriously this is a strange affair</s>  why should two men lie in waitfor the regiment and fire at two of its officers</s>  the men have beenbehaving well as far as i have heard on the line of march and nothinghas occurred which could explain such an outrage as this</s> it may be fancy on my part colonel ronald said but i cannot helpthinking that it is a sequence of that affair i told you about in parisjust before we started</s>  the first shot struck my horse and the secondwould certainly have killed me had it not been for the horses suddenswerve therefore it looks as if the shots were aimed at me</s>  i have somereason too for supposing that i have been followed</s>  if you remember myquestion last night at supper about the men who wanted to sell me ahorse</s>  malcolm anderson is convinced that the whole thing was only a ruseto enable them to become acquainted with my face</s>  they wanted to be ableto recognize me and so got up this story in order to have me pointed outto them and to have a talk with me</s>  none of the officers did send themto me as they said and they could hardly have hit upon a better excusefor speaking to me</s> it certainly looks like it colonel hume said gravely</s>  i would give agood deal if we had caught those two men in the wood</s>  if we had i wouldhave given them the choice of being hung at once or telling me what wastheir motive in firing at you and who paid them to do it</s>  this ismonstrous</s>  if we could get but a shadow of proof against your enemies iwould lay a formal complaint before the king</s>  marquis or no marquis i amnot going to have my officers assassinated with impunity</s>  however tillwe have something definite to go upon we can do nothing and until thenleslie you had best keep your suspicion to yourself</s>  it were best to saynothing of what you think in this country it is dangerous even towhisper against a kings favourite</s>  let it be supposed that this attackin the woods was only the work of some malicious scoundrels who must havefired out of pure hatred of the kings troops</s> captain campbell and ronald quite agreed with the view taken by thecolonel and answered all questions as to the affair that they had notthe least idea who were the men who fired on them and that no oneobtained as much as a glimpse of them</s> with most of the officers of the regiment indeed with all except oneronald was on excellent terms</s>  the exception was a lieutenant namedcrawford he was first on the list of his company and had indeed beentwice passed over in consequence of his quarrelsome and domineeringdisposition</s>  he was a man of seven or eight and twenty he stood aboutthe same height as ronald and was of much the same figure indeed thegeneral resemblance between them had often been remarked</s> his dislike to ronald had arisen from the fact that previous to thelatter joining the regiment crawford had been considered the bestswordsman among the officers and ronalds superiority which had beenproved over and over again in the fencing room had annoyed him greatly</s> knowing that he would have no chance whatever with ronald in a duel hehad carefully abstained from open war showing his dislike only bysneering remarks and sarcastic comments which frequently tried ronaldspatience to the utmost and more than once called down a sharp rebukefrom colonel hume or one or other of the majors</s>  he did not lose theopportunity afforded by the shots fired in the wood and was continuallysuggesting all sorts of motives which might have inspired the would beassassins</s> ronald who was the reverse of quarrelsome by disposition laughed goodtemperedly at the various suggestions but one or two of the seniorofficers remonstrated sharply with crawford as to the extent to which hecarried his gibes</s> you are presuming too much on leslies good nature crawford captaincampbell said one day</s>  if he were not one of the best tempered youngfellows going he would resent your constant attacks upon him and youknow well that good swordsman as you are you would have no chanceswhatever if he did so</s> i am quite capable of managing my own affairs crawford said sullenlyand i do not want any advice from you or any other man</s> i am speaking to you as the captain of leslies troop captain campbellsaid sharply and i do not mean to quarrel with you</s>  you have had morequarrels than enough in the regiment already and you know colonel humesaid on the last occasion that your next quarrel should be your last inthe regiment</s>  i tell you frankly that if you continue your course ofannoyance to young leslie i shall report the matter to the colonel</s>  ihave noticed that you have the good sense to abstain from your remarkswhen he is present</s> three days later the regiment joined the army before namur</s> that evening having drunk more deeply than usual lieutenant crawfordafter the colonel had retired from the circle round the fire and to histent recommenced his provocation to ronald and pushed matters so farthat the latter felt that he could no longer treat it as a jest</s> mr</s>  crawford he said i warn you that you are pushing your remarkstoo far</s>  on many previous occasions you have chosen to make observationswhich i could if i had chosen have resented as insulting</s>  i did notchoose for i hate brawling and consider that for me who have butlately joined the regiment to be engaged in a quarrel with an officersenior to myself would be in the highest degree unbecoming but i am surethat my fellow officers will bear me out in saying that i have shownfully as much patience as is becoming</s>  i therefore have to tell youthat i will no longer be your butt and that i shall treat any furtherremark of the nature of those you have just made as a deliberate insultand shall take measures accordingly</s> a murmur of approval rose among the officers sitting round and thosesitting near crawford endeavoured to quiet him</s>  the wine which he hadtaken had however excited his quarrelsome instinct too far for eithercounsel or prudence to prevail</s> i shall say what i choose he said rising to his feet</s>  i am not goingto be dictated to by anyone much less a boy who has just joined theregiment and who calls himself leslie though no one knows whether hehas any right to the name</s> very well sir leslie said in a quiet tone which was however hearddistinctly throughout the circle for at this last outburst on the partof crawford a dead silence had fallen on the circle for only onetermination could follow such an insult</s>  captain campbell will i hopeact for me</s> certainly captain campbell said in a loud voice and will call uponany friend lieutenant crawford may name and make arrangements to settlethis matter in the morning</s> macleod will you act for me</s>  crawford said to a lieutenant sittingnext to him</s> i will act the young officer said coldly as your second in thematter but all here will understand that i do solely because it isnecessary that some one should do so and that i disapprove absolutelyand wholly of your conduct</s> well make what arrangements you like crawford said with an oath andrising he left the circle and walked away</s> when he had left there was an immediate discussion</s>  several of theofficers were of opinion that the duel should not be allowed to proceedbut that crawfords conduct should be reported to the colonel</s> i am entirely in your hands gentlemen ronald said</s>  i have no desirewhatever to fight</s>  this affair has been forced upon me and i have noalternative but to take it up</s>  i am not boasting when i say that i am afar better swordsman than he and i have no need to shrink from meetinghim but i have certainly no desire whatever to take his life</s>  he hasdrunk more than he ought to do and if this matter can be arranged andhe can be persuaded in the morning to express his regret for what he hassaid i shall be very glad to accept his apology</s>  if it can be settled inthis way without either fighting or reporting his conduct to the colonelwhich would probably result in his having to leave the regiment i shouldbe truly glad  what is that</s>  he broke off as a loud cry rang throughthe air</s> the whole party sprang to their feet and snatching up their swords ranin the direction from which the cry had come</s>  the tents were at somelittle distance and just as they reached them they saw a man lying onthe ground</s> good heavens it is crawford</s>  captain campbell said stooping over him</s> see he has been stabbed in the back</s>  it is all over with him</s>  who canhave done it</s> he questioned several of the soldiers who had now gathered roundattracted like the officers by the cry</s>  none of them had seen the act orhad noticed anyone running away but in so large a camp there were somany people about that an assassin could well have walked quietly awaywithout attracting any attention</s> the colonel was speedily on the spot and instituted a rigid inquiry butentirely without success</s>  the attack had evidently been sudden andentirely unsuspected for crawford had not drawn his sword</s> it is singular he said as with the officers he walked slowly back tothe fire</s>  crawford was not a popular man but i cannot guess at anyreason for this murder</s>  strange that this should be the second attackmade on my officers since we left paris</s> captain campbell now related what had taken place after he had left thecircle</s> the matter should have been reported to me at once he said althoughas it has turned out it would have made no difference</s>  perhaps afterall it is best as it is for a duel between two officers of the regimentwould have done us no good and the man was no credit to the regiment</s> but it is a very serious matter that we should be dogged by assassins</s> leslie come up with me to my tent</s>  i am not going to blame you lad hesaid when they were together for you could not have acted otherwisethan you have done</s>  indeed i have myself noticed several times thatcrawfords bearing towards you was the reverse of courteous</s>  have you anyidea as to how he came by his death</s> i sir</s>  ronald said in surprise</s>  no i know no more than the others</s> it strikes me leslie that this is only the sequel of that attack inthe wood and that your enemies have unwittingly done you a service</s> crawford was very much your height and build and might easily have beenmistaken for you in the dark</s>  i fancy that blow was meant for you</s> it is possible sir ronald said after a pause</s>  i had not thought ofit but the likeness between him and myself has been frequently noticed</s> it is quite possible that that blow was meant for me</s> i have very little doubt of it my lad</s>  if any of these men were hangingabout and saw you as they believed coming away from the circle alonethey may well have taken the opportunity</s>  let it be a lesson to you to becareful henceforth</s>  it is unlikely that the attempt will be repeated atpresent</s>  the men who did it will think that they have earned their moneyand by this time are probably on the way to paris to carry the news andclaim their reward</s>  so that for a time at least it is not probable thatthere will be any repetition of the attempt</s>  after that you will have tobe on your guard night and day</s> i wish to heaven we could obtain some clue that would enable me to takesteps in the matter but at present we have nothing but our suspicionsand i cannot go to the king and say three attempts have been made on thelife of one of my officers and that i suspect his grandfather themarquis de recambours has been the author of them</s> when malcolm heard the events of the evening his opinion was exactly thesame as that of the colonel and he expressed himself as convinced thatcrawford had fallen by a blow intended for ronald</s>  he agreed that for awhile there was no fear of a renewal of the attempt</s> the fellows will take the news straight to paris that you have been putout of the way and some time will elapse before the employers know thata mistake has been made</s>  then as likely as not they will decide to waituntil the campaign is over</s>
the camp before namur was a large and brilliant one</s>  the king and dauphinhad already arrived with the army</s>  all the household troops were thereand a large contingent of the nobles of the

few minutes later heobserved that the last time a king of france with his son had fought atthe head of the french army was at the battle of poictiers</s> there was a general laugh</s> certainly the king was not happy with his reminiscences major munroremarked but i think this time the tables are going to be turned</s>  inthe first place we considerably outnumbered the enemy even after leaving15000 men to continue the siege</s>  in the second place the position wehave chosen is almost impregnable</s>  the scheldt covers our right with thefortified bridge securing our communication

constructed and the whole of the position isfortified with breastworks and abattis as far as fontenoy</s>  between thatvillage and barre the natural difficulties are so great that field worksare unnecessary</s>  i cannot believe myself that they will attack us in sucha position especially as nearly half their army are dutch who willcount for little</s>  the english are the only troops which we shall findformidable</s> before daybreak the camp was astir and the troops took the positionsassigned to them</s>  even now it was hardly believed that an attack would bemade by the enemy so long

every battle in which englandand france had met as enemies the citizens of paris organized asuccession of brilliant fetes which were responded to by entertainmentsof all kinds at versailles</s>  the scottish dragoons were still at thefront but colonel hume had been brought to paris as it would be sometime ere he would be able again to take the command of the regiment</s> ronald called at the house where the colonel lodged upon the day afterhis return from tours and found that he had arrived upon the previousday</s>  ronald was at once shown up on sending in his name</s>  the colonel waslying on the couch when he entered</s> how are you colonel</s> i am going on as well as possible ronald they found the ball and gotit out the day before i left the regiment and i shall do well now</s>  ihave been carried on a litter all the way by eight of our troopers andthe good fellows were as gentle with me as if i had been a child and iscarce felt a jar the whole distance</s>  what i have got to do now is to liequiet and the doctor promises me that in six weeks time i shall be fitto mount a horse again</s>  marshal saxe sent yesterday evening to inquireafter me and i will send you to him to thank him for so sending and toinquire on my part how he himself is going on</s>  my message will be a goodexcuse for your presenting yourself</s> ronald found the antechamber of the marshal crowded with nobles andofficers who had come to pay their respects to the victorious generalwho was next to the king himself at that moment the most popular man infrance</s>  hitherto as a protestant and a foreigner maurice of saxony hadbeen regarded by many with jealousy and dislike but the victory which hehad won for the french arms had for the first time obliterated everyfeeling save admiration and gratitude</s> presently the marshal came out from the inner room with the dauphin whohad called on the part of the king to inquire after his health</s>  he wasnow able to walk the excitement of the battle and the satisfaction ofthe victory having enabled him partially to shake off the disease whichafflicted him</s>  after the dauphin had left the marshal made the tour ofthe apartment exchanging a few words with all present</s> ah</s>  you are there my young leslie he said familiarly when he came toronald</s>  where have you been</s>  i have not seen you since the day when yougalloped about with my messages through the english fire as if you had acharmed life</s> colonel hume gave me leave sir to travel on private business</s>  i am nowthe bearer of a message from him thanking you for the kind inquiries asto his wound he bids me say that he trusts that your own health israpidly recovering</s> as you see leslie fontenoy has done wonders for me as well as forfrance but wait here i will speak with you again</s> in half an hour most of the callers took their departure then themarshal called ronald into an inner room</s> tomorrow he said i am going to pay my respects to the king atversailles</s>  i will take you with me</s>  have you your mothers memorial</s> that is right</s>  as her father was killed at fontenoy there will i hopebe the less difficulty over the matter but we must not be too sanguinefor there will be a host of hungry competitors for the estates of themarquis and all these will unite against you</s>  however i do not thinkthe king will be able to refuse my first request and when your mother isout we must put our heads together and see about getting your fathersrelease</s> ronald expressed his deep gratitude at the marshals kindness</s> say nothing about it my lad</s>  fortunately i want nothing for myself andit is no use being a victorious general if one cannot utilize it in someway so i am quite glad to have something to ask the king</s> the next day ronald presented himself at the hotel of marshal saxe androde by the side of his carriage out to versailles</s>  the king surroundedby a brilliant train of courtiers received the marshal with the greatestwarmth and after talking to him for some time retired with him into hisprivate closet</s>  a few minutes later one of the royal pages came out intothe audience chamber and said in a loud voice that the king desired thepresence of monsieur ronald leslie</s> greatly embarrassed at finding himself the centre of observation notunmingled with envy at the summons ronald followed the page into thepresence of the king who was alone with marshal saxe</s>  louis who was inhigh good humour gave ronald his hand to kiss sayingi told the marshal to recall your name to me and he has done so now</s>  hesays that you have a boon to ask of me</s> yes sire the marshal said and please consider graciously that it isi who ask it as well as he</s>  your majesty has always been gracious to meand if you think me deserving of any mark of your favour after thissuccess which your majesty and i have gained together i would now cravethat you grant it</s> it is granted before you name it marshal the king said</s>  i give youmy royal word that whatever be your boon provided that it be within thebounds of possibility it is yours</s> then sire i ask that an old comrade and fellow soldier of mine whofought bravely for your majesty but who fell under your majestysdispleasure many years ago on account of a marriage which he madecontrary to your pleasure may be released</s>  he has now been over sixteenyears in prison and has therefore paid dearly for thwarting your willand his wife has all this time been confined in a convent</s>  they are thefather and mother of this brave lad  colonel leslie who commanded yourmajestys regiment of scotch dragoons and his wife the countess amelieof recambours</s>  i ask your majesty as my boon that you will order thisofficer to be released and the lady to be allowed to leave the convent</s> peste marshal</s>  the king said good temperedly your request is one ofwhich will get me into hot water with a score of people</s>  from the day themarquis was killed at fontenoy i have heard nothing but questions abouthis estates and i believe that no small portion of them have beenalready promised</s> i say nothing about the estates the marshal replied as to that yourmajestys sense of justice is too well known for it to be necessary forme to say a single word</s>  the countess has estates of her own which sheinherited from her mother but even as to these i say nothing</s>  it is herliberty and that of her husband which i and this brave lad ask of yourmajesty</s> it is granted marshal and had your boon been a great one instead of asmall one i would have granted it as freely and the king again held outhis hand to ronald who bent on one knee to kiss it tears of joy flowingdown his cheeks and preventing the utterance of any audible thanks forthe boon which far surpassed his expectations for the marshal had saidnothing as to his intention of asking his fathers freedom which indeedhe only decided to do upon seeing in how favourable a disposition he hadfound the king</s> you see marshal louis went on marriages like this must be sternlydiscouraged or all order in our kingdom would be done away with</s>  wilfulgirls and headstrong soldiers cannot be permitted to arrange theiraffairs without reference to the plans of their parents and in thisinstance it happened that the fathers plans had received our approval</s> the great estates of france cannot be handed over to the first comer whomay perhaps be utterly unworthy of them</s>  i do not say that in the presentcase colonel leslie was in any way personally unworthy but the disposalof the hands of the great heiresses of france is in the kings gift andthose who cross him are against his authority</s> the king touched a bell and bade the page who entered to order hissecretary to attend at once</s> search the register of the state prisons he said and tell me wherecolonel leslie who was arrested by our orders sixteen years ago isconfined and then make out an order to the governor of his prison forhis release also draw up an order upon the lady superior of  and hepaused</s> the convent of our lady at tours ronald ventured to put in</s> oh</s>  you have discovered that eh</s>  the king said with a smile and thenturned again to the secretary  bidding her suffer the countess ameliede recambours to leave the convent and to proceed where she will</s> the secretary bowed and retired</s>  ronald seeing that his own presence wasno longer required said a few words of deep gratitude to the king andretired to the audience room where he remained until ten minutes laterthe door of the kings closet opened and the king and marshal saxe againappeared</s>  the audience lasted for another half hour and then themarshal accompanied by many of the nobles made his way down to hiscarriage</s>  ronald again mounted and as soon as the carriage had left thegreat courtyard of the palace rode up alongside and poured out hisgratitude to the marshal</s> it has been another fontenoy the marshal said smiling</s>  here are thetwo orders the one for tours the other for the governor of the royalcastle at blois</s>  the king made light of it but i know his manner so wellthat i could see he would rather that i had asked for a dukedom for you</s> it is not often that kings are thwarted and he regards your parents asbeing rebels against his authority</s>  however he was bound by his promiseand there are the papers</s>  now only one word leslie</s>  do not indulge inany hopes that you will see your father more than a shadow of thestalwart soldier that he was sixteen years ago</s>  there are few menindeed whose constitution enable them to live through sixteen yearsconfinement in a state prison</s>  therefore prepare yourself to find him amere wreck</s>  i trust that freedom and your mothers care may do much forhim but dont expect too much at first</s>  if you take my advice you willgo first and fetch your mother in order that she may be at hand toreceive your father when he leaves the fortress</s>  by the way i thought itjust as well not to produce your mothers memorial as it seemed that weshould be able to do without it for it might have struck the king to askhow you obtained it and he would probably have considered that yourcommunication with your mother was a fresh act of defiance against hisauthority</s> malcolm was wild with joy when ronald returned with the account of hisinterview with the king and its successful result and had his not been aseasoned head the number of bumpers which he drank that night in honourof marshal saxe would have rendered him unfit for travel in the morning</s> ronald had after acquainting him with the news gone to colonel humewhose pleasure at hearing that his former colonel and comrade was toregain his freedom was unbounded</s>  every preparation was made for an earlystart</s> be sure you look well to the priming of your pistols before you put themin your holsters tomorrow malcolm said</s> do you think it will be necessary</s> i am sure of it ronald</s>  news travels fast and you may be sure that bythis time the fact that the king has granted an order for the release ofyour father and mother is known to the duke of chateaurouge</s>  if he didnot hear it from the king himself which he would be most likely to doas louis would probably lose no time in explaining to him that he hadonly gone against his wishes because under the circumstances it wasimpossible for him to refuse the marshals request the secretary whodrew out the document would no doubt let the duke know of it</s>  there areno secrets at court</s> but now that the orders for release have been granted ronald saidthe duke can have no motive in preventing them being delivered forfresh ones could of course be obtained</s> in the first place ronald the duke will be so furious at your successthat he will stick at nothing to have his revenge in the second placehe and the others for there are many interested in preventing yourmother from coming into her fathers possessions will consider that thegain of time goes for a good deal</s>  you are the mover in the matter</s>  wereyou out of the way and the documents destroyed the matter might rest asit is for a long time</s>  the marshal is busy from morning till night andwould be long before he missed you and would naturally suppose that youhad after obtaining the release of your parents retired with them tosome country retreat or even left the kingdom</s> this would give ample time for working upon louis</s>  besides the kingmight never inquire whether the prisoners had been released</s>  then themarshal might die or be sent away to the frontier</s>  therefore as you seetime is everything</s>  i tell you ronald i consider the journey you aregoing to undertake tomorrow an affair of greater danger than going into apitched battle</s>  you will have to doubt everyone you meet on the road thepeople at the inns you stop at  you may be attacked anywhere andeverywhere</s>  as to our travelling by the direct road i look upon it asimpossible</s>  our only chance is to throw them off the scent and as theyknow our destination that will be no easy matter</s> they were astir by daylight and malcolm soon brought the horses round tothe door</s> its a comfort to know he said that the horses have passed the nightin the barracks and that therefore they have not been tampered with</s> look well to the buckles of your girths ronald</s>  see that everything isstrong and in good order</s> that is not your own horse malcolm is it</s> no it is one of the troopers</s>  it is one of the best in the regimentand i persuaded the man to change with me for a week</s>  no one is likely tonotice the difference as they are as nearly as possible the same colour</s> your horse is good enough for anything but if i could not keep up withyou its speed would be useless</s>  now i think we can keep together if wehave to ride for it</s> what have you got in that valise malcolm</s>  one would think that you weregoing upon a campaign</s> i have got four bottles of good wine and bread and meat enough to lastus for two days</s>  i do not mean if i can help it to enter a shop or stopat an inn till we arrive at tours</s>  we can make a shift to sleep fortonight in a wood</s>  it would be safer a thousand times than an inn for iwill bet fifty to one that if we ventured to enter one we should find oneor both of our horses lame on starting again</s> oh come malcolm thats too much</s>  the duke of chateaurouge is notubiquitous</s>  he has not an army to scatter over all france</s> no he has not malcolm agreed but from what i know of him i doubtnot that he can lay his hands on a number of men who will stick atnothing to carry out his orders and earn his money</s>  paris swarms withdischarged soldiers and ruffians of all kinds and with plenty of gold toset the machine in motion there is no limit to the number of men whomight be hired for any desperate deed</s> as they were talking they were making their way towards one of thesouthern gates</s>  they arrived there before it opened and had to wait afew minutes</s>  several other passengers on horseback and foot were gatheredthere</s> i could bet a crown piece malcolm said that some one among thiscrowd is on the watch for us and that before another half hour the dukeof chateaurouge will know that we have started</s> chapter x a perilous journey</s> a number of peasants with market carts were waiting outside the gatesand for the first few miles of their ride the road was dotted with peoplemaking their way to the city</s>  as they rode malcolm discussed thequestion of the best road to be taken</s>  ronald himself was still in favourof pushing straight forward for he was not so convinced as his followerthat a serious attempt would be made to interrupt their journey</s>  hepointed out that the road as far as orleans at least was one of themost frequented in france and that in that city even the most recklesswould hardly venture to assault them</s> i agree with you ronald that the road offers less opportunities forambushes than most others for the country is flat and well cultivatedbut after all a dozen men with muskets could lie in ambush in a cornfieldas well as a wood and the fact that people are going along the roadcounts for little one way or the other for not one in fifty wouldventure to interfere if they saw a fray going on</s>  but granting that sofar as orleans the country is open and cultivated beyond that it is forthe most part forest but above all  although they may regard it aspossible that we may be on our guard and may travel by other roads  itis upon this direct line that they are sure to make the most preparationsfor us</s>  beyond that it can only be chance work</s>  we may go by one road orby another</s>  there may be one trap set on each road but once past thatand we are safe</s> after riding for upwards of an hour they came at the turn of the roadupon two carts</s>  one had apparently broken down and the other had stoppedthat those with it might give assistance in repairing it</s>  one cart wasturned across the road and the other filled the rest of the space</s> stop</s>  malcolm exclaimed checking his horse suddenly</s> what is it</s>  ronald asked in surprise</s> turn back</s>  malcolm said sharply as he wheeled his horse round</s> ronald without a word did the same and they galloped a hundred yardsdown the road</s> we were nearly caught there malcolm said</s> why how do you mean</s> never mind now ronald</s>  turn sharp to the right here and make a detourthrough the fields</s>  you will soon see whether i was right</s> it is a shame riding through this ripe corn ronald said as withoutany further comment he leaped his horse over the bank and dashed offamong the golden grain which stretched far and wide on both sides of theroad</s> they had not gone fifty yards before they heard loud shouts and as theycame abreast of where the carts were standing several shots were firedand ten or twelve men were seen running through the corn as if to cutthem off</s>  but although they heard the whiz of the bullets they were toofar off to be in much danger and the men on foot had no chance ofcutting them off a fact which they speedily perceived as one by onethey halted and fired</s>  a few hundred yards farther the two horsemen cameround into the road again and pursued their journey</s> well what do you think of that ronald</s> it was an ambush no doubt malcolm but what on earth made you suspectit</s>  i saw nothing suspicious</s>  merely two carts in the road with three orfour men doing something to one of the wheels</s> i am in a suspicious humour this morning ronald and it is lucky i am</s> the sight of the two carts completely blocking the road brought me to ahalt at once and as i checked my horse i saw a movement among the busheson the right of the road and felt sure that it was an ambush</s>  it was awell laid one too and had we ridden on we should have been riddled withbullets</s>  no doubt there were men lying in the carts</s>  they would havejumped up as we came up to them and the fellows in the bushes would havetaken us in the rear between their two fires our chances would have beensmall indeed</s>  no doubt they had a man on watch and directly they saw uscoming they got their carts across the road and took up their positions</s> it was a well contrived scheme and we have had a narrow escape</s> thanks to your quickness and watchfulness malcolm which has saved ourlives</s>  i admit that you are right and i was wrong for i own that i didnot share your apprehensions as to the dangers of our journey</s>  henceforthi will be as much on the lookout as you are and will look with suspicionat every beggar woman that may pass</s> and you will be right to do so malcolm said seriously but for thepresent i think that we are safe</s>  this no doubt was their main ambushand they may reasonably have felt certain of success</s>  however we may besure that they did not rely solely upon it</s>  this no doubt is theunmounted portion of their gang</s>  they were to try and put a stop to ourjourney at its outset but mounted men will have ridden on aheadespecially as they couldnt have been sure that we should follow thisroad</s>  we might have gone out by one of the other gates at the south sideof the town and they will have watched all the roads</s>  now i propose thatwe take the next lane which branches off to the right and travel bybyroads in future</s>  do not press your horse too fast</s>  we have a longjourney before us and must always have something in hand in case it isnecessary to press them to full speed</s> two miles further a road branched to the right</s>  as they approached itronald was about to touch his horses rein when malcolm said shortlyride straight on</s> although surprised at this sudden change of plan ronald obeyed withoutquestion</s> what was that for</s>  he asked when he had passed the turning</s> did you not see that man lying down by the heap of stones at thecorner</s> yes i saw him but what of that</s> i have no doubt he was on the lookout for us</s>  yes i thought so hewent on as he stood up in his stirrups and looked back there do yousee that horses head in that little thicket just this side of where theroad separates</s>  i expected as much</s>  if we had turned off in another twominutes that fellow would have been galloping along this road to take thenews to those ahead and they would have ridden to cut us off furtheralong</s>  i have no doubt we shall find someone on watch at every turningbetween this and orleans</s> but this is a regular campaign malcolm</s> it is a campaign ronald</s>  the ruffians and thieves of paris form a sortof army</s>  they have heads whom they implicitly obey and those who havemoney enough to set this machine in motion can command the services ofany number of men</s>  sharp fellows too many of them are and when theyreceived orders to arrest our journey to tours at any cost they wouldnot omit a single precaution which could ensure success</s>  their formerattack upon you and its result will have showed them that we are notchildren and that the enterprise was one which demanded all theirefforts</s> what is our next move now malcolm</s> we will turn off before we get to the next road</s>  they can see a long wayacross these level plains so we will dismount and lead our horses</s>  thecorn is well nigh shoulder deep and if we choose a spot where the groundlies rather low neither that scoundrel behind nor the one at the nextroad is likely to see us</s> half a mile further there was a slight dip in the ground</s> this is a good spot malcolm said</s>  this depression extends far away onour right and although it is very slight and would not conceal us ifthe ground were bare it will do so now so let us take advantage of it</s> so saying he dismounted and leading his horse turned into thecornfield</s>  ronald followed him and for two miles they kept straight onthrough the corn then they came upon a narrow road connecting twovillages</s>  they mounted and turned their horses heads to the south</s> it is as well that none of the peasants saw us making through theircorn ronald said or we should have had them upon us with stone andflail like a swarm of angry bees</s> it could not be helped malcolm replied and we could easily haveridden away from them</s>  however it is just as well that we have had nobother with them</s>  now we will quicken our pace</s>  we are fairly between twoof the main roads south and if we can contrive to make our way by thesevillage tracks we shall at any rate for some time be free from all riskof molestation</s> i should think we should be free altogether ronald said</s>  when theyfind we do not come along the road they will suppose we have been killedat the first ambush</s> malcolm shook his head</s> do not build upon that ronald</s>  no doubt as soon as we had passed someof those fellows mounted the horses we saw in the carts and rode off inaccordance with an agreed plan to give notice that we had passed themsafely and were proceeding by that road</s>  in the next place the fellow wesaw on watch would most likely after a time mount and follow us and whenhe got to the watcher at the next crossroad and found that we had notcome along there would know that we must have turned off either to theright or left</s>  one of them is doubtless before this on his way to thenext party with the news while the other has set to work to find outwhere we turned off which will be easy enough to discover</s>  still wehave gained something and may fairly reckon that if we ride brisklythere is no fear of those who were posted along the road we have leftcutting us off</s> they rode all day at a steady pace stopping occasionally for a shorttime to allow the horses a rest and a feed</s>  the people in the quietlittle villages looked in surprise at the young officer and his followeras they rode through their street or stopped for a quarter of an hourwhile the horses were fed for even malcolm agreed that such pauses wereunattended by danger</s>  it was rarely indeed that a stranger passed alongthese bypaths and the peasants wondered among themselves what couldinduce them to travel by country byways instead of following the mainroads</s> as they left the rich plains of the beauce the country was lesscarefully cultivated</s>  the fields of corn were no longer continuous andpresently they came to tracts of uncultivated land with patches of wood</s> they now left the little road they had been following and rode straightacross country avoiding all villages</s>  they crossed several hills andlate in the afternoon drew rein in a wide spreading forest</s>  they weremalcolm thought quite as far south as orleans and by starting atdaylight would arrive at tours by midday</s> here at least we are perfectly safe he said when we approach toursour perils will begin again</s>  when once they find that we have given themthe slip they are not likely to try to intercept us anywhere along theroute till we near the town for they will know that the chances areenormous against their doing so and the parties along the various roadswill push on so as to meet us somewhere near that city</s>  the river canonly be crossed at certain points and they will feel sure we shall go byone or other of them</s> and i suppose we shall ronald said</s> no ronald my idea is that we turn west and ride to le mans then takea wide detour and enter tours from the south side</s>  it will take us a daylonger but that is of little consequence and i think that we shall inthat way entirely outwit them</s>  the only precaution we shall have to takeis to cross the main road on our right at some point remote from any townor village</s> i think that is a capital plan</s>  i do not mind a share of fair fightingbut to be shot down suddenly in an ambush like that of this morning iown i have little fancy for it</s> hobbling their horses they turned them loose to pick up what they couldin the forest and then sat down to enjoy a good meal from the amplesupply malcolm had brought with him</s>  when night fell they unstrappedtheir cloaks from their saddles and rolled themselves in them and laydown to sleep</s>  an hour later they were roughly awakened each beingseized by three men who before they could attempt to offer resistancebound their arms to their sides and then hurried them along through theforest</s> i have been a fool ronald malcolm said bitterly i ought to havekept watch</s> it was not your fault malcolm</s>  one could never have guessed that theywould have found us in this forest</s>  somebody must have followed us at adistance and marked us down and brought the rest upon us but even hadyou kept watch it would have been no good for they would have shot usdown before we could make any resistance</s> i wonder they didnt cut our throats at once malcolm said</s>  i dontknow what they are troubling to make us prisoners for</s> presently they saw a light in the forest ahead of them and soon arrivedat a spot where a number of men were sitting round a fire</s> you had no trouble with them pierre i suppose</s> no captain they slept as soundly as moles</s>  they have been speakingsome strange language as we came along</s> thank god</s>  malcolm exclaimed fervently</s>  i think after all ronald wehave only fallen in with a band of robbers and not with our enemies</s> unbind their hands the captain of the band said but first take awaytheir swords and pistols</s>  gentlemen may i ask you to be seated andthen perhaps you will inform us what you an officer in the scotchdragoons as i perceive by your uniform are doing here in the forest</s> ronald to whom the question was principally addressed replied franklywe took to this forest i fancy for the same reason for which you useit namely for safety</s>  we are on our way to tours and there are somepeople who have interest in preventing our arriving there</s>  they made oneattempt to stop us near paris fortunately that failed or we should notbe now enjoying your society but as it was likely that another attemptwould be made upon the road we thought it better to leave it altogetherand take to the forest for the night</s> what interest could anyone have in preventing an officer of the kingfrom arriving at tours</s>  the man asked doubtfully</s> it is rather a long story ronald said but if it is of interest toyou i shall be happy to relate it and i may mention that there are threebottles of good wine in the valise of one of the saddles and a story isnone the worse for such an accompaniment</s> a laugh went round the circle at ronalds coolness and a man steppedforward with the two saddles which he had carried from the spot when thecaptives had been seized</s>  the wine was taken out and opened</s> yes the captain of the band said after tasting it the wine is goodnow let us have your story</s> ronald gave them an outline of his history told them how his father andmother had been for many years imprisoned for marrying contrary to thekings pleasure and how he had at last obtained the royal order fortheir release and how the enemies of his parents were now trying toprevent him from having those orders carried out</s>  there are the ordersronald said as he concluded taking them from the inner pocket where hecarried them</s>  you see they are addressed to the abbess of the convent ofour lady at tours and to the governor of blois</s> the story you tell us is a singular one the captain replied and idoubt not its truth</s>  what was the name of your father</s> he was colonel leslie and commanded the same regiment to which ibelong</s> i remember him one of the band said</s>  our regiments were quarteredtogether nigh twenty years ago at flanders and i was in paris at thetime when he was imprisoned</s>  we were in the next barracks to thescotchmen and i remember what a stir it made</s>  the regiment was very nighmutinying</s> and i remember you too though i cannot recall your name malcolm saidrising and looking hard at the speaker and if i mistake not we havecracked many a flask together and made many a raid on the hen roosts ofthe flemish farmers</s>  my name is malcolm anderson</s> i remember you well the other said rising and giving him his hand</s> of course i met you scores of times for the regiments were generallybrigaded together</s> that confirms your story altogether monsieur the captain of the bandsaid</s>  from this moment do not consider yourself a prisoner any longer</s>  imay say that we had no expectation of booty in your case and you werecaptured rather from curiosity than from any other reason</s>  one of my menthis afternoon happened to see you ride into the wood and then dismountand make preparations for passing the night there</s>  he reported the matterto me</s>  i know that gentlemen of your cloth  i may say of mine for iwas once an officer of his majesty though i left the service somewhathastily and he smiled on account of an unfortunate deficiency in thefunds of the regiment in which i happened at the time to be acting aspaymaster  are seldom burdened with spare cash but the incident seemedso strange that i determined to capture and question you</s>  if you happento have more cash on you than you care about carrying we shall be glad topurchase a few bottles of wine equal to that which you have given us</s>  ifnot i can assure you that i do not press the matter</s> </s> i am obliged to you for your courtesy ronald said and as at presenti really happen to be somewhat flush of cash i am happy to contribute tenlouis for the laudable purpose you mention</s> so saying he took out his purse counted out ten pieces and handed themto the captain</s> the action was received with a round of applause for the robbers hadnot from the first anticipated obtaining any booty worth speaking ofand the turn affairs had taken had altogether driven any idea of gainfrom their minds</s> i thank you warmly sir the captain said and promise you that i willtomorrow despatch a messenger to orleans which is but ten miles awayand will lay out the money in liquor with which we will tomorrow nightdrink your health and success in the enterprise</s>  nay more if you likea dozen of my men shall accompany you on your road to tours</s>  they havefor various reasons which i need not enter into a marked objection topassing through towns but as far as blois they are at your service</s> i thank you for your offer ronald replied but will not accept it aswe intend to ride tomorrow morning to le mans and then to enter toursfrom the south side by which we shall throw our enemies completely offthe scent</s> but why do you not go to blois first</s>  the man asked</s>  it is on your wayto tours</s> i wish my mother to be present at the release of my father</s>  so long aconfinement may well have broken him down</s>  now that i see how obstinatelybent our enemies are upon our destruction i will take with me two orthree stout fellows from tours to act as an escort</s> what day will you be leaving there</s>  the man asked</s> today is tuesday ronald said on thursday we shall be at tours onfriday morning we shall leave</s> very well the man replied we will be on the road</s>  it is nodifference to us where we are and as well there as here</s>  i will have menscattered all along in the forest between blois and amboise and if ifind that there are any suspicious parties along the road we will catchthem and if you are attacked you will find that we are close at hand tohelp you</s>  you are a generous fellow and your story has interested me</s>  wegentlemen of the woods are obliged to live whatever the law says but ifwe can do a good action to anybody it pleases us as well as others</s> i am greatly obliged to you ronald said and can promise you anyhowthat your time shall be not altogether thrown away</s> soon afterwards the whole band lay down round the fire and were soundasleep</s>  in the morning malcolm saddled the two horses and after a heartyadieu from the captain and his followers  all of whom were dischargedsoldiers who had been driven to take up this life from an inability tosupport themselves in any other way  they started for le mans whichtown they reached late in the afternoon without adventure</s> deeming it in the highest degree improbable that any watch would be setfor them at a place so far from their line of travel they put up for thenight at the principal inn</s>  in the morning they again started and afterriding for some distance to the south made a wide sweep and crossingthe river entered tours from the south late in the evening</s>  they againput up at the principal inn for although they doubted not that theirarrival would be noticed by the emissaries of the enemy they had no fearof molestation in a town like tours</s>  and on the following morning ronaldpresented himself at the entrance to the convent</s> i wish to see the lady superior he said to the lay sister at thewicket</s>  i am the bearer of a communication to her from the king</s> he was left waiting for a few minutes outside the gate then the wicketdoor opened and the sister requested him to follow her</s>  not a soul wasto be seen as he traversed the gloomy courts and passed through severalcorridors to the room where the

to depart</s> a carriage shall be in waiting at the gate to receive her ronald saidbowing and then without another word retired</s> malcolm was awaiting him outside and they at once went to the officer ofthe royal post and engaged a carriage and post horses to take them toblois</s> the carriage was at the door at the appointed time and a few minuteslater the gate opened and the countess in travelling attire issuedout and in a moment was clasped in her sons arms</s>  he at once handed herinto the carriage and took his place beside her</s>  malcolm closed the doorand leapt up on the box the postilion cracked his whip and the carriagemoved off</s> can it be true ronald or am i dreaming</s>  it is but a week since youwere here last and the news of my release came upon me with such asurprise that do you know i fainted</s>  am i really free</s>  is it possiblethat i have seen the last of those hateful walls</s>  it seems like a dream</s> where are we going</s> we are going to blois</s> to a prison</s>  the countess exclaimed</s>  but no there are no guards orescorts</s>  are we going oh ronald are we going to see my husband</s> yes mother we are going not only to see him but to release him</s>  ihave the kings order in my pocket</s> for some time the countess was unable to speak her joy was too great forwords</s>  then tears came to her relief and she sobbed out exclamations ofjoy and gratitude</s>  ronald said nothing until she had somewhat recoveredher calmness and then he told her the manner in which marshal saxe hadobtained the two orders of release</s> i will pray for him night and morning to the last day of my life thecountess said</s>  god is indeed good to me</s>  i had hoped from what yousaid that my term of imprisonment was drawing to an end but i hadlooked forward to a long struggle to endless efforts and petitionsbefore i could obtain your fathers release with perhaps failure inthe end</s>  not for one moment did i dream that such happiness as thisawaited me</s> ronald now thought it wise to repeat the warning which the marshal hadgiven him</s> mother dear he said you must be prepared to find that a total changewill have taken place in my father</s>  his imprisonment has been a verydifferent one to yours</s>  you have had companions and a certain amount offreedom and comfort</s>  you have had people to speak to and have known whatis going on in the world</s>  he has been cut off altogether from mankind</s>  hecannot even know whether you are alive or whether you may not haveyielded to the pressure that would be sure to be brought upon you andacquiesced in a divorce being obtained</s>  he has doubtless been kept in anarrow cell deprived almost of the air and light of heaven</s>  he will begreatly changed mother</s>  he will not be like you for it does not seem tome that you have changed much from what you were</s>  i could not see youmuch that night on the terrace but now i see you i can hardly believethat you are my mother so young do you look</s> i am nearly forty the countess said smiling</s>  i was past twentyonewhen i married</s>  had i not been of age they could have pronounced themarriage null and void</s>  but you are right ronald and i will preparemyself to find your father greatly changed</s>  it cannot be otherwise afterall he has gone through but so that i have him again it is enough forme no matter how great the change that may have taken place in him</s>  butwho are these men</s>  the countess exclaimed as a quarter of a mileoutside the town four men on horseback took up their places two on eachside of the carriage</s> do not be alarmed mother they are our escort</s>  malcolm hired them at lemans</s>  they are all old soldiers and can be relied on in case ofnecessity</s> but what need can there be for them ronald</s>  i have heard that bands ofdischarged soldiers and others make travelling insecure but i had noidea that it was necessary to have an armed escort</s> not absolutely necessary mother but a useful measure of precaution</s>  weheard of them as we came through from paris and malcolm and i agreedthat as you would have with you any jewels and valuables that you took tothe convent it would be just as well to be in a position to beat off anywho might be disposed to trouble us</s>  as you see they have brought withthem malcolms horse and mine and we shall now mount</s>  the less weightthe horses have to draw the better</s>  i will get in and have a talk fromtime to time where the road happens to be good but to tell you thetruth the jolting and shaking are neither pleasant nor good fortalking</s> you are expecting to be attacked ronald the countess said</s>  i am sureyou would not be wanting to get out and leave me so soon after we havemet did you not anticipate some danger</s> frankly mother then i do think it is probable that an attempt may bemade to stop us and that not by regular robbers but by your enemies</s> they did their best to prevent me from reaching tours and will now mostlikely try to prevent our arriving at blois</s>  i will tell you all about itwhen we get there tonight</s>  here is the order for my fathers release</s> will you hide it in your dress</s>  i had rather not have it about me</s>  andmother if we should be attacked do not be alarmed for i have reason tobelieve that if we should be outnumbered and hard pressed help willspeedily be forthcoming</s> i am not in the least afraid for myself the countess said but becareful ronald</s>  remember i have only just found you and for my sake donot expose yourself unnecessarily</s> i will take care of myself mother he said</s>  you know i have alwayshad to do so</s> malcolm had already mounted his horse and ronald was really glad when hetook his place beside him a few yards ahead of the carriage</s>  the art bothof road making and carriage building was still in its infancy</s>  when theweather was fine and the ground hard a fair rate of progress could bemaintained but in wet weather the vehicles often sank almost up to theiraxles in mud holes and quagmires and the bumping and jolting wereterrible</s> now we take up our work of looking out for ambushes again malcolm</s> it will not be quite the same thing now malcolm said</s>  before two orthree men with guns behind a wall might do the business now they willhave to make a regular attack</s>  i have no doubt that we were watched fromthe time we entered the town and that the news that we are travellingwith the countess in a carriage and with an escort of four armed menhas been carried on ahead already</s>  it is by horsemen that we shall beattacked today if we are attacked at all and they will probably fallupon us in the forest beyond amboise</s>  they will know that with a vehiclewe must keep the road and that as we cannot travel more than six milesan hour at the outside we cannot attempt to escape by our speed</s> do you think we had better wait at amboise for the night and go on toorleans tomorrow</s> no i think we had better push straight on especially as we told ourfriends in the forest that we should come today and i feel sure theywill keep their promise to be on the lookout to aid us</s>  if it were notfor that i should have said let us stay at tours for the present for wemay expect to be attacked by a force much superior to our own</s> why they would not have sent down more than six men to attack us twomalcolm</s> no if they had been sure which road we should travel but as theydidnt know that they may have had small parties at half a dozen spotsand these will now be united</s>  probably there may be a score of them</s> however i rely on the robbers</s>  the captain meant what he said and youwon the goodwill of all the men</s>  if there are a dozen horsemen anywherealong the road they are sure to know of it and will i have no doubtpost themselves close at hand so as to be ready to join in the fray assoon as it commences</s> amboise was reached without adventure</s>  here the horses in the carriagewere changed and the party proceeded on their way</s>  four miles furtherthey entered a great forest</s>  ronald now ordered two of the men to ride afew yards in front of the horses heads</s>  he and malcolm rode on each sideof the coach the other two followed close behind</s>  he ordered the driverin case they were attacked to jump off instantly and run to the horsesheads and keep them quiet during the fray</s> a vigilant lookout was kept</s>  suddenly when they were in the thickestpart of the wood a number of mounted men dashed out from either side</s>  inobedience to the orders ronald had given the men in front and behind atonce closed in so that there were three on either side of the carriage</s> the assailants fired their pistols as they dashed down but the bulletsflew harmlessly by while the fire of the defenders sitting quietly ontheir horses was more accurate two of the assailants falling deadwhile another was severely wounded</s> a moment later swords were drawn and a furious combat ensued</s>  ronald hadtold his men to keep close to the carriage so that they could not beattacked in the rear keeping just far enough out on either side of himto be able to use their swords</s>  for a short time the defenders of thecoach maintained their position the number of their assailants givingthem but slight advantage as they were unable to utilize their force</s> ronald ran the first man who attacked him through the body and laid openthe face of the next with a sweeping blow from left to right</s>  the menthey had hired fought stoutly but they were being pressed together asthe assailants urged forward their horses when suddenly a volley offirearms was heard</s> several of the assailants fell dead and with a loud shout a number ofmen rushed out from the wood and fell upon them in rear</s>  the assailantsturned to fly and it was now the turn of the defenders of the coach toattack which they did furiously</s> in two or three minutes all was over</s>  five or six only of the assailantscut their way through the footmen who had attacked them in rear whiletwelve lay dead or dying on the ground</s>  ronalds first impulse was toride up to the carriage to assure his mother of his safety his next toleap off his horse and grasp the hand of the chief of the robbers</s> you have kept your promise nobly he said and arrived at the verynick of time</s>  they were beginning to press us hotly and though i fancywe should have rendered an account of a good many more we must have beenbeaten in the end</s> i was farther behind than i intended to be the man said but we wereobliged to keep in hiding some little distance behind them</s>  there werefour parties of them</s>  we kept them in sight all yesterday and last nightthey assembled a mile or two away</s>  i had men watching them all night andthis morning we followed them here and saw them take up their positionon both sides of the road</s>
 we crept up as closely as we dared withoutbeing observed but you had for a couple of minutes to bear the brunt ofit alone</s> i thank you most heartily ronald said</s>  my mother will thank youherself so saying he led them to the door of the carriage which heopened</s> mother i told you that if we were attacked i relied upon help beingnear at hand</s>  we owe our lives for i have no doubt that yours as well asmine would have been taken to this brave man and his followers</s> i thank you most sincerely sir the countess said</s>  at present i feellike one in a dream for i have been so long out of the world that such ascene as this has well nigh bewildered me</s> i am only too glad to have been of service the man said as he stoodbareheaded</s>  i am not a good man madame</s>  i am one of those whom thenecessities of the times have driven to earn their living as they canwithout much regard to the law but i trust that i have not quite lost myinstincts as a gentleman and i am only too glad to have been able to beof some slight assistance to a persecuted lady for your son the othernight related to us something of the treatment which you have had toendure</s> with a bow he now stepped back</s>  his followers were engaged in searchingthe pockets of the fallen and found in them a store of money which spokewell for the liberality of their employer and well satisfied the robbersfor the work they had undertaken</s>  after a few words with her son thecountess opened a small bag she carried with her and taking from it avaluable diamond brooch called the leader of the band up and presentedit to him</s> ronald and his party then remounted their horses  the robbers hadalready overtaken and caught those of the fallen assailants  the drivermounted the box and after a cordial farewell to their rescuers the partyproceeded on their way to blois</s> chapter xi free</s> it was late at night before blois was reached and having alighted at theaigle dor they engaged a private room</s> even the duke of chateaurouge will be satisfied ronald said that hisschemes have failed and that no more can be done just at present</s>  itwill be a bitter blow to him when those scoundrels on their return toparis report their utter failure for he must have considered itimpossible that we could escape from the toils he had laid for us</s>  i onlywish that we had clear evidence that he is the author of these attempts</s> if so i would go straight with marshal saxe and lay an accusationagainst him before the king but however certain we may feel about it wehave really nothing to connect him with the affair and it would bemadness to accuse a kings favourite unless one could prove absolutelythe truth of what one says</s>  however i hope some day that i shall geteven with him</s>  it will not be my fault if i do not</s> that night ronald and his mother debated what would be the best way toproceed in the morning and finally they agreed that malcolm shouldpresent himself at the prison with the order of release and that theyshould remain at the hotel to which malcolm should bring colonel leslieafter breaking to him the news that his wife and son were both awaitinghim</s>  the shock in any case of sudden liberty would be a severe oneand the meeting with his attached comrade would act as a preparation forthat with his wife</s> mother and son sat hand in hand after hearing the carriage drive off withmalcolm next morning</s>  in the hours they had spent together they had cometo know each other and the relationship had become a real one</s>  they hadscarce been able to make out each others features at their midnightmeeting on the terrace and at that meeting rejoiced as they both werethere was still a feeling of strangeness between them</s>  now they knew eachother as they were and both were well satisfied</s>  the countess was lessstrange to ronald than he was to her</s>  malcolm had already described herto him as he knew her eighteen years before and the reality agreedclosely with the ideal that ronald had pictured to himself except thatshe was younger and brighter</s>  for in thinking of her he had told himselfover and over again that she would have grown much older that her hairmight have turned gray with grief and trouble and her spirit beenaltogether broken</s> she on her part had been able to form no idea as to what the infant shehad last seen would have grown up and was not even sure that he was inexistence</s>  she had hoped that if he had lived he would have grown up likehis father and although she now saw but slight resemblance between themshe was indeed well satisfied with her son</s> he was not she thought as handsome as his father but he bade fair tosurpass him in strength and stature</s>  she was delighted with his manlybearing and when he laughed he reminded her of her husband and shethought that she read in his gray eye and firm mouth a steadfastness anddepth of character equal to his</s>  they spoke but little now</s>  both were tooanxious ronald for his mothers sake rather than his own</s>  he wasprepared to find this unknown father a man broken down by his years ofcaptivity but although his mother said that she too was prepared forgreat changes he could not but think that the reality would be a sadshock to her</s>  in little over an hour the carriage drove into thecourtyard</s> be brave mother ronald said as he felt the hand he held in his owntremble violently</s>  you must be calm for his sake</s> steps were heard approaching</s>  the door opened and malcolm entered with aman leaning on his arm</s>  the countess with a cry of joy sprang forwardand the next moment was clasped in her husbands arms</s> at last my love at last</s>  she said</s> ronald drew aside to the window to leave his father and mother to enjoythe first rapture of their meeting undisturbed while malcolm slippedquietly from the room again</s> why amelie leslie said at last holding her at arms length that hemight look the better at her you are scarce changed</s>  it does not seemto me that you are five years older than when i saw you last and yetmalcolm tells me that you too have been a prisoner</s>  how much my love hascost you dear</s>  no you are scarce changed while i have become an oldman  my hair is as white as snow and i am so crippled with rheumatismi can scarce move my limbs</s> you are not so much changed angus</s>  your hair is white and your face isvery pale but you are not so much changed</s>  if i have suffered for yourlove dear what have you suffered for mine</s>  i have been a prisoner in away but i had a certain amount of freedom in my cage while you  andshe stopped</s> yes it has been hard he said but i kept up my spirits amelie</s>  inever lost the hope that some day we should be reunited</s> and now angus here is our boy to whom we owe our liberty and the joyof this meeting</s>  you may well be proud of such a son</s> i am proud leslie said as ronald advanced and he took him in hisarms</s>  god bless you my boy</s>  you have performed well nigh a miracle</s> malcolm has been telling me of you</s>  call him in again</s>  it is right thathe to whom you owe so much should share in our happiness</s> ronald at once fetched malcolm and until late at night they talked ofall that had happened during so many years</s>  colonel leslie had passed thefirst three years of his confinement in the chatelet</s>  it was well it wasno longer he said for even i hard as i was with years of soldieringcould not have stood that much longer</s>  my cell there was below the levelof the river</s>  the walls were damp and it was there i got the rheumatismwhich has crippled me ever since</s>  then they moved me to blois and theremy cell was in one of the turrets and the sun shone in through thewindow slit for half an hour a day besides for an hour once a week i wasallowed to take what they called exercise on the wall between my turretand the next</s>  the governor was not a bad fellow and did not try topocket the best part of the money allowed for the keep of the prisoners</s> fortunately i never lost hope</s>  had i done so i would have thrown myselfover the parapet and ended it at once</s>  i felt sure that you too were shutup amelie and i pictured to myself how they would try to make you giveme up but i never thought they would succeed dear</s>  i knew you too wellfor that</s>  sometimes for months i lay as if paralysed by rheumatism and ithink i should have died if i had not known how my enemies would haverejoiced at the news of my death</s>  so i held on stoutly and i have got myreward</s> but the hardships had told their tale</s>  although but the same age asmalcolm anderson colonel leslie looked fully ten years older</s>  his longconfinement had taken every tinge of colour out of his face and left italmost ghastly in its whiteness</s>  he could with difficulty lift his handsto his head and he walked as stiffly as if his legs had been jointless</s> his voice only had not lost the cheery ring his wife remembered</s> no amelie he said when she remarked this</s>  i kept my tongue inpractice it was the one member that was free</s>  after i had been confineda few months it struck me that i was rapidly losing the power of speechand i determined that if i could not talk for want of someone to answerme i could at least sing and having a good store of songs scottish andfrench i sang for hours together at first somewhat to the uneasiness ofthe prison authorities who thought that i could not be so merry unless ihad some communication from without or was planning an escape but atlast they grew accustomed to it and as my voice could not travel throughthe thick walls of my cells it annoyed no one</s> and did you never think of escaping father</s> the first few years of my confinement i was always thinking of itronald but nothing ever came of my thought</s>  i had no tools to burrowthrough a four foot wall and if i could have done so i should have triedif it had only been to give me something to do had it not been that ihoped some day to obtain my release and that any attempt at escapewould if discovered as it was almost certain to be decrease mychances</s> not a word was said that evening as to their future plans all theirthoughts being in the past but the next morning colonel leslie said atbreakfastand now what are we going to do next</s>  how do we stand</s> i know no more than you do angus</s>  i do not know whether the king hasgifted my mothers estate to others as assuredly he has done my fatherslands</s>  if he has i have been thinking that the best plan will be to askthe kings permission to leave the kingdom and return to your nativescotland</s> i am very fond of scotland amelie but i have also a fondness forliving and how i should live in scotland i have not the most remoteidea</s>  my estate there was but a small one and was forfeited thirty yearsago so unless i become a gaberlunzie and sit on the steps of st</s>  andrewsasking for alms i dont see how we should get porridge to say nothingof anything else</s>  no amelie it seems to me that we must stop in france</s> for very shame they cannot let the daughter of the marquis de recamboursstarve and they must at least restore you a corner of your parentsestates if it be but a farm</s>  how are we off for funds at present</s>  heasked with a laugh</s>  i hope at least we have enough to pay our hotelbill</s> we have forty louis in cash father the remains of the hundred youcommitted to malcolm with me</s> is that so</s>  he exclaimed</s>  all i can say is that that money has lastedlonger than any that ever passed through my fingers before</s> we have plenty of money the countess said quietly</s>  i have all thejewels which came to me from my mother and their sale will keep us foryears either in scotland or france</s> that is good indeed the colonel said cheerily</s> yes i took them all with me when i was sent to the convent and haveparted with none save the diamond necklet which i gave to the girl whobrought ronald and me together as a parting keepsake and a brooch withwhich i rewarded the men who aided us in the forest but seriouslyangus we must settle upon something</s> i quite agree with you amelie but what is that something to be</s> i should think angus that the proper thing would be for me to write tothe king thanking him for our release asking his commands andpetitioning him that my mothers estates may be restored to me</s>  i willalso ask permission to retire to some southern town where there arewaters which may do good to your rheumatism</s> colonel leslie frowned</s> i suppose that is the right thing to do amelie though for my part icannot thank a sovereign whom i have served well after such treatment asi have received</s>  i would rather beg my bread from door to door</s> no i would not ask you angus and of course you are differentlyplaced but i have my rights as a peeress of france besides i have on myown account no complaint against the king</s>  it was my father who shut meup in the convent not the king</s> by the way amelie her husband said you are not yet in mourning</s> nor do i intend to be she said firmly unless i have to go to courtno thread of mourning do i put on</s>  my father behaved like a tyrant to meand i will not feign a grief at an event which has brought us happiness</s> well ronald what do you think had best be done</s>  you and malcolm havemanaged so well that we had best leave it for you to decide</s> i think what you propose mother is best</s>  i think you had better traveldown to some place near where your mothers estates lay and then writeyour petition to the king</s>  i will leave you there and return with it toparis and will there consult colonel hume and marshal saxe as to how itshould be delivered to the king</s> this plan was carried out</s>  the party journeyed together to poitiers andthere having seen his parents comfortably settled in a small house nearthe town and remained with them a few days ronald with malcolm returnedto paris bearing with him his mothers memorial to the king</s> ronald was glad to find that colonel hume was now recovered from hiswound</s>  marshal saxe too was better the latter at once took charge of thepetition and said that he would hand it to the king on the firstopportunity</s>  ronald accompanied the marquis several times to versaillesbut the latter had no private audience with the king and thought itbetter not to present the memorial in public</s>  one day however he wascalled into the kings closet</s> when he emerged with the king ronald thought from his expression ofcountenance that things had not gone well</s>  on leaving the palace hemounted his horse  for he was now well enough to ride  and as he setout he called ronald who with other gentlemen had accompanied him toride beside him</s> things have not gone well he said</s>  your fathers enemies haveevidently been at work and have been poisoning the kings mind</s>  he readthe memorial and then said harshly the countess of recambours hasforfeited all rights to her mothers estates by marrying an alien</s>  thelands of france are for the king of frances subjects not for soldiersof fortune</s>  this touched me and i said your majesty may recollectthat i am an alien and a soldier of fortune and methinks that in time ofwar the swords of our soldiers of fortune have done such things forfrance that they have earned some right to gratitude</s>  in a hundredbattles our scottish troops have fought in the front ranks and had itnot been for the irish brigade we should not have had to write fontenoydown among the list of french victories</s> you are bold marshal the king said angrily</s> i am bold sire i replied because i am in the right and i humblysubmit that a brave soldier like colonel leslie deserves better treatmentthan he has received at the hands of france</s> the king rose at once</s> an answer to the petition will be sent to you tomorrow marshal</s> i bowed and without another word the king left his closet and enteredthe room of audience</s>  however lad you must not look so downcast</s>  wecould perhaps expect no more the first time</s>  of course every man who hasa hope or who has a relation who has a hope of obtaining the grant ofyour mothers estates is interested in exciting the kings displeasureagainst her besides which there is as you have told me the duc dechateaurouge who may be regarded as a personal enemy of your father andwho has the kings ear as much as anyone about him</s>  however we must havecourage</s>  i consider my personal honour is touched in the matter now andi will not let the matter drop till justice is done</s> at the appointed time ronald again called at marshal saxes hotel andwatched the gay crowd of officers and nobles who were gathered in hisreception rooms</s>  an hour later a royal attendant entered and handed adocument to the marshal</s>  the latter glanced at it and looked around</s>  assoon as his eye fell upon ronald he nodded to him</s> here is the judgement he said in a low tone as he handed him thepaper</s>  you see it is directed to the countess to my care</s>  i suppose youwill start with it at once</s> yes marshal the horses are saddled and we shall leave immediately</s> dont hurry your horses the marshal said with a slight smile fromthe kings manner i think that the contents are such that a few hoursdelay in the delivery will cause the countess no pain</s>  however i do notanticipate anything very harsh</s>  in the first place although the king isswayed by favourites who work on his prejudices his intention is alwaysto be just and in the second place after granting the release of yourparents as a boon to me he can scarcely annul the boon by any severesentence</s>  will you tell the countess from me that i am wholly at herservice and that should any opportunity offer she may be sure that iwill do what i can to incline the king favourably towards her</s>  lastlyleslie take care of yourself</s>  the change in the kings manner shows thatyou have powerful enemies and now that you have succeeded in obtainingyour parents freedom you have become dangerous</s>  remember the attack thatwas made upon you before when there seemed but little chance that youwould ever succeed in obtaining their release or in seriously threateningthe interests of those who were looking forward to the reversion of thefamily estates</s>  their enmity now when it only needs a change in thekings mood to do justice to your parents will be far greater thanbefore</s> bid your father too to have a care for himself and your mother</s> remember that violence is common enough and there are few inquiriesmade</s>  an attack upon a lonely house and the murder of those within it isnaturally put down as the act of some party of discharged soldiers orother ruffians</s>  tell him therefore he had best get a few trusty menaround him and be on guard night and day against a treacherous attack</s> those who stand in the way of powerful men in france seldom live long sohe cannot be too careful</s> a quarter of an hour later ronald was on horseback</s>  he had alreadyprovided himself with a pass to leave the city after the usual hour ofclosing the gates and he and malcolm were soon in the open country</s>  asthey rode along ronald repeated the warning that the marshal had givenhim</s> he is quite right ronald and you cannot be too careful</s>  we haveagainst us first this vindictive duc de chateaurouge who no doubthas poisoned the kings mind</s>  in all france there is no one whom i wouldnot rather have as a foe</s>  he is powerful unscrupulous and vindictivehe would hesitate at nothing to carry out anything on which he had sethis mind and would think no more of obtaining the removal of one whom heconsidered to stand in his way than of crushing a worm</s>  even as a youngman he had a villainous reputation and was regarded as one of the mostdangerous men about the court</s>  to do him justice he is brave and a fineswordsman and for choice he would rather slay with his own hands thosewho offend him than by other means</s>  though he was but threeandtwenty atthe time i first left france he had fought half a dozen duels and killedas many men and several others who were known to have offended him diedsuddenly</s>  some were killed in street brawls returning home at night oneor two were suspected of having been poisoned</s>  altogether the man wasfeared and hated in those days although of course none spoke theirsuspicions openly</s> from what i have heard those suspicions have stuck to him ever since</s>  hehas not been engaged in many duels because in the first place edictsagainst duelling are very strict and in the second because hisreputation as a swordsman is so great that few would risk their livesagainst him</s>  still all who stood in his way have somehow or other come toa sudden end</s>  we must therefore be on our guard night and day</s>  he is ofcourse your most dangerous foe but besides him must be numbered allthose who hope to obtain your mothers estates</s>  the heirs of the marquisdoubtless feel perfectly safe from interference</s>  there is no chancewhatever of the king dispossessing them in favour of a foreigner so weneed not count them among your foes</s> it is just as well ronald that we started tonight instead of waitingtill tomorrow</s>  the duke is pretty certain to learn that the kings answerwill be sent this evening and may possibly have made preparations foryou on the road but he will hardly expect that you will start before themorning</s>  however in order to be on the safe side i propose that we shallpresently turn off from the main road and avoid all large towns on ourway down to poitiers</s> do you think the danger is as great as that malcolm</s> i do not think there is much danger ronald just at present though ido in the future</s> travelling by byways ronald and malcolm arrived at poitiers withoutadventure</s> i have brought you the kings answer mother ronald said as healighted but before you open it i may tell you that it is unfavourablethough i am ignorant of the precise nature of its contents</s>  but you mustnot be disappointed</s>  marshal saxe bade me tell you that he considers hishonour engaged in seeing you righted and that whenever an opportunityoccurs he will endeavour to move the kings mind in your favour</s>  how ismy father</s> he suffers grievously from rheumatism ronald and can scarce move fromhis couch</s> as soon as they joined the colonel the countess opened the kings letter</s> it was brief</s>  the countess amelie de recambours is hereby ordered towithdraw at once to her estate of la grenouille and there to await thekings pleasure concerning her</s> the kings signature was affixed</s> well that is not so very bad the countess said</s>  at any rate my rightto one of my mothers estates is recognized</s>  la grenouille is thesmallest of them and contains but three or four farms</s>  still that willsuffice for our wants and as it lies but twenty miles from bordeaux theair will be warm and soft for you angus</s> is there a chateau on it mother</s> yes there is a small chateau</s>  i was there once as a girl</s>  it has neverbeen modernized but is still a castle such as it was two hundred yearsago</s> all the better ronald said and he then gave malcolms reasons fortheir being on the watch against any sudden attack</s> he is quite right ronald colonel leslie said</s>  the duke is capable ofanything</s>  however we will be on our guard and if as your mother saysit is a fortified house we need have no fear of any sudden attack</s> i would suggest colonel that i should ride to tours malcolm saidand hire two of the men who escorted madames carriage</s>  they have servedin the wars and can be relied upon</s>  they would not need high wages formost of the discharged soldiers have trouble enough to keep body and soultogether</s>  with a couple of men of this kind and two or three of the menon the estate i think colonel you need fear no sudden attack</s> the colonel approved of the suggestion and a week later malcolm havingreturned with the two men a carriage was hired to convey the colonel andhis wife and so they journeyed quietly down to la grenouille</s>  onarriving there they found that they were expected the old steward incharge having received a letter from the royal chancellor saying that hewas to receive the countess as the owner of the estate</s> the old man who had known her mother well and remembered her visits as achild received the countess with respectful joy</s>  the chateau was asamelie had said really a castle</s>  it was surrounded by a moat filled withwater from which the walls rose abruptly with no windows in the lowerstories and only small loopholes in those above</s>  although the steward wasignorant when his mistress might be expected he had already caused greatfires to be lighted in all the rooms and had temporarily engaged two ofthe farmers daughters to wait upon the countess and three stout men asservitors</s> what are the revenues of the estate</s>  the countess asked the stewardthat evening</s>  my mothers other estates have not been restored to me asyet and i have only this to depend upon and i do not know whatestablishment i can afford to keep up</s> the revenue amounts to twelve thousand francs he said</s>  there arethree large farms and four small ones</s>  twelve thousand francs are notmuch countess for your mothers daughter but they go a long way herewhere one can live for next to nothing</s>  we have a garden which willprovide all the fruit and vegetables you require and your poultry willcost you nothing</s>  the vineyard attached to the chateau furnishes morethan enough wine and the cellars are well filled for every year i haveput aside a few barrels so that in fact it will be only meat you have tobuy</s> so that you think i can keep the two men i have brought with me and theservants you have engaged</s> easily madam and more if you wished it</s> do you think five men will be sufficient</s>  the countess said</s>  i askbecause i have powerful enemies and in these lawless times an attackupon a lonely house might well be carried out</s> with the drawbridge drawn up madam five men could hold the chateauagainst a score and the sound of the alarm bell would bring all thetenants and their men down to your assistance</s>  i will answer for themall</s>  there were great rejoicings last week when i sent round the newsthat you were expected</s>  the memory of your mother who once resided herefor a year is very dear to all of us and there is not a man on theestate but would take up arms in your defence</s>  the sound of the alarmbell would bring thirty stout fellows at least to your aid</s> then we need not trouble on that score amelie the colonel saidcheerfully</s>  malcolm will see to the drawbridge tomorrow probably it hasnot been raised for years</s> i have already been examining it malcolm  who had just entered theroom  said</s>  it only needs a little oil and a bolt or two</s>  i will haveit raised tonight</s>  things look better than i expected colonel and ishall be able to return to paris without having any anxiety upon yourscore</s> but you are not thinking of going back ronald</s>  the countess askedanxiously</s>  if there is danger here for us there must be surely dangerfor you in paris</s>  and i want you here with us</s> i will stop for a few days mother and then malcolm and i will be off</s> as i have marshal saxes protection i need fear no open enmity fromanyone and as i shall be with the regiment i shall be safe from thesecret attacks besides my sword can guard my head</s> you have taught him to defend himself  eh malcolm</s>  colonel lesliesaid</s> i malcolm repeated  i can use my sword in a melee colonel as youknow and hold my own against dutchman or german when i meet them on thefield but ronald is a different blade altogether</s>  he was well taught inglasgow and has practised under the best maitres darmes in paris sinceand i am proud to say that i do not think there are ten men in franceagainst whom he could not hold his own</s> that is good that is good indeed the colonel said delighted</s> malcolm i feel my obligations to you more and more every day</s>  truly ihad never even hoped that if my son were ever to be restored to me ishould have such cause to be proud of him</s> but why do you think you had better return to paris ronald</s>  his motherinquired</s> because mother it will not do to let your enemies have entirely theirown way now that you have been so far restored</s>  doubtless your familywill be the more inclined to aid you with their influence but there mustbe somebody to urge them to do so</s> besides amelie the colonel put in we must not cage the lad here atyour apron strings</s>  he has already won saxes regard and protection byhis conduct in the field and can now accept a commission in the oldregiment</s>  he has begun well and may yet live to command it</s>  no no mylove</s>  i should like to keep him here as much as you would but in everyway it is better that he should go out and take his place in the world</s> to you and me after our long imprisonment this place is life freedomand happiness and we are together but for him it is a dreary littlecountry chateau and he would soon long for a life among men</s> and so after three weeks stay at the chateau ronald and malcolm rodeback to paris and the former received a week later a commission throughmarshal saxe in the scottish dragoons</s>  that regiment had returned fromthe frontier and ronald at once took his place in its ranks and washeartily received by all the officers to whom he was formally introducedby colonel hume as the son of their former commanding officer</s> a short time afterwards it became the turn of duty of the scottishdragoons to furnish guards for a week at versailles and colonel humetook down two troops for that purpose</s>  that to which ronald belonged wasone of them</s>  ronald knowing that for the present he was not in favourwith the king begged the colonel to put him on duty as often aspossible so that he might avoid the necessity of being present at thekings audiences with the other officers</s> he was one day walking with the colonel and several other officers in thegrounds at a distance from the palace when they came at the turn of thewalk upon the duc de chateaurouge and three other gentlemen of thecourt</s>  the former stopped abruptly before colonel hume</s> i had the honour colonel hume to speak to you some time since of avolunteer in your regiment who chose to call himself the name of leslie</s> i understand he is now an officer</s>  i see by the lists in the courtyardthat a cornet leslie is now on duty here</s>  where does he hide himself fori have been seeking in vain to meet him</s> cornet leslie is not one to balk any mans desire that way colonelhume said gravely</s>  this is cornet leslie</s> ronald stepped forward and looked the duke calmly in the face</s> so this is the young cockerel the duke said contemptuously</s>  a worthyson of a worthy father i doubt not</s> at any rate my lord duke ronald said quietly i do not rid myself ofmy foes by getting those i am afraid to meet as man to man thrown intoprison nor by setting midnight assassins upon them</s>  nor do i rely uponmy skill as a swordsman to be a bully and a coward</s> the duke started as if struck</s> i had made up my mind to kill you young sir he said sooner orlater but you have brought it on yourself now</s>  draw sir</s>  and the dukedrew his sword</s> colonel hume and several others threw themselves before ronald</s> put up your sword sir</s>  duelling is forbidden and you know theconsequence of drawing within the precincts of the palace</s> what care i for ordinances</s>  the duke said furiously</s>  stand asidegentlemen lest i do you harm</s> harm or no harm colonel hume said sternly my young friend shall notfight in the palace grounds</s>  i protest against his being forced into aduel at all but at any rate he shall not fight here</s> the duke looked for a moment as if he was about to spring upon colonelhume but he saw by their faces that his companions also were againsthim</s>  for the consequences of drawing a sword within the precincts of apalace were so serious that even the most powerful nobles shrank frombraving them</s> very well he said at last thrusting his sword back into its scabbard</s> it is but ten minutes walk to the boundary wall i will let him livetill then</s> so saying he started off with rapid strides down the walk followed at aslower pace by the rest</s> chapter xii the end of the quarrel</s> this is a serious business leslie the colonel said in a low voice</s> if it had been anyone but you i should have ordered him to the barracksat once under pain of arrest and have laid the matter before the kingfor it would have been nothing short of murder</s>  but i can trust you tohold your own even against the duke of chateaurouge</s>  and in truth afterwhat has been said i do not see that you can do other but meet him</s> i would not avoid it if i could ronald said</s>  his insults to me do notdisturb me but i have my fathers wrongs to avenge</s> forbes the colonel said to one of the other officers do you gostraight to the barracks bid leslies man saddle his own horse and hismasters instantly and bring them round outside the wall of the park</s>  ifleslie wounds or kills his man he will have to ride for it</s> the officer at once hurried away</s> ronald i will tell you a piece of news i heard this morning</s>  the youngchevalier left paris secretly five days ago and i have received certainprivate information this morning that he has gone to nantes and that heis on the point of sailing for scotland on his own account</s>  i am toldthat this plan of his is known to but five or six persons</s>  if you getsafely through this business mount and ride thither at all speed</s>  theyare more likely to pursue you towards the frontier or the northern portsand will not think you have made for nantes</s>  if you get there before theprince has sailed present yourself to him and join his expedition</s>  theking will be furious at first both at the loss of his favourite and thebreaking of the edicts but he must come round</s>  the gentlemen here withthe duke are all honourable men and were i could see shocked at theinsult which the duke passed on you</s>  therefore i can rely upon them tojoin me in representing the matter in its true light to the king</s>  beforeyou return the matter will have blown over and it may be that theremoval of your fathers most powerful enemy may facilitate anarrangement</s>  in any case my dear boy you can rely upon the marshal andmyself to look after your interests</s> they had now reached a wicket gate in the wall of the park</s>  the duke wasstanding a few paces distant having already removed his coat and turnedup the shirt sleeve of the sword arm</s> you will act as second marquis</s>  he said to one of the gentlemen</s> the latter bowed coldly</s> i act as second to my friend leslie colonel hume said</s>  and i callupon you all gentlemen to bear witness in the future that thisencounter has been wantonly forced upon him by the duc de chateaurougeand that cornet leslie as a man of honour has no alternative whateverbut to accept the challenge forced upon him</s> ronald had by this time stripped to his shirt sleeves</s>  the seconds tookthe two swords and compared their length</s>  they were found to be as nearlyas possible the same</s>  they were then returned to their owners</s>  a piece ofeven turf was selected and a position chosen in which the light wasequally favourable to both parties</s>  then both fell into position onguard and as the rapiers crossed colonel hume said solemnlymay god defend the right</s> an instant later they were engaged in deadly conflict</s>  it lasted but afew seconds</s>  the duke conscious of his own skill and believing that hehad but a lad to deal with at once attacked eagerly desirous ofbringing the contest to a termination before there was any chance ofinterruption</s>  he attacked then carelessly and eagerly and made afurious lunge which he thought would terminate the encounter at once butronald did not give way an inch but parrying in carte slipped his bladeround that of the duke feinted in tierce and then rapidly disengaginglunged in carte as before</s>  the blade passed through the body of hisadversary and the lunge was given with such force that the pommel of hissword struck against the ribs</s>  the duke fell an inert mass upon theground as ronald withdrew the rapier</s> an exclamation of surprise and alarm broke from the three gentlemen whohad accompanied the duke while colonel hume said gravelygod has protected the right</s>  ah</s>  here come the horses</s>  mount and rideleslie and do not spare the spurs</s>  i should advise you he saiddrawing him aside to take the northern route for a few miles so as tothrow them off the scent</s>  when you get to nantes search the inns till youfind the duke of athole he is an intimate friend of mine and it wasfrom him i learned in strict secrecy of the princes intentions</s>  show himthis ring he knows it well and tell him i sent you to join him saynothing at first as to this business here</s>
 your own name and my name willbe enough</s>  he will introduce you to prince charlie who will be with himunder a disguised name</s>
 may god bless you my lad</s>  we will do our bestfor you here</s> at this moment malcolm arrived with the two horses</s> thank god you are safe ronald</s>  he exclaimed as ronald leapt into hissaddle and with a word of thanks and adieu to the colonel dashed off atfull speed</s> colonel hume then rejoined the group gathered round the duke</s>  thescottish officers were looking very grave the courtiers even more so</s> they had from the first recognized fully that the duel had been provokedby the duke and had accompanied him reluctantly for they regarded theapproaching conflict as so unfair that it would excite a strong amount offeeling against all who had a hand in the matter</s>  as to the edict againstduelling it had not concerned them greatly as they felt sure that withthe dukes influence the breach of the law would be passed over with onlya show of displeasure on the part of the king and an order to absentthemselves for a short time from court</s>  the contingency that this youngscottish officer who had scarcely yet attained the age of manhoodshould kill one of the best swordsmen in france had not occurred to thembut this had happened and there could be no doubt that the kings angeralike at the loss of his favourite and at the breach of the law wouldfall heavily on all concerned and that a prolonged exile from court wasthe least evil they could expect</s>  not a word had been spoken after theyhad on stooping over the duke found that death had been instantaneousuntil colonel hume joined them</s> well gentlemen he said this is a bad business and means troublefor us all</s>  his majesty will be vastly angry</s>  however the duke broughtit upon himself and is the only person to blame</s>  his character is prettywell known and it will be manifest that if he had made up his mind tofight no remonstrance on your part would have availed to induce him toabstain from doing so</s>  at the same time the king will not in the firstburst of his anger take that into consideration and for awhile we shallno doubt all of us suffer from his displeasure but i do not think thatit will be lasting</s>  the duke forced on the duel and would have foughtwithin the royal park had we not interfered and we were in a way forcedto be present</s>  i propose that we return to the palace and give notice ofwhat has occurred</s>  captain forbes as you were not present at the affairand will not therefore be called upon to give any account of it will youremain here until they send down to fetch the body</s> we will if you please gentlemen walk slowly for every mile thatleslie can put between him and versailles is very important</s>  the newswill reach the kings ears very shortly after we have made it public</s>  youand i marquis as the seconds in the affair are sure to be sent forfirst</s>  as fortunately we were both present at the quarrel we are bothin a position to testify that the duke brought his fate upon himselfthat there was no preventing the duel and that had we refused to act hewas in a frame of mind which would have driven him to fight withoutseconds if none had been forthcoming lastly we can testify that thecombat was a fair one and that the duke fell in consequence of therashness of his attack and his contempt for his adversary although inpoint of fact i can tell you that young leslie is so good a swordsmanthat i am confident the result would in any case have been the same</s> i suppose theres nothing else for it the marquis grumbled</s>  i mustprepare myself for a prolonged visit to my country estates</s> and i shall no doubt be placed under arrest for some time colonel humesaid and the regiment will probably be packed off to the frontieragain</s>  however these things dont make much difference in the long run</s> what i am most anxious about marquis is that his majesty shouldthoroughly comprehend that leslie was not to blame and that this affairwas so forced upon him that it was impossible for him to avoid it</s>  thereis much more than the lads own safety dependent on this</s> you may be sure colonel that i will do him justice</s> at a slow pace the party proceeded until they neared the palace whenthey quickened their steps</s>  the marquis proceeded immediately to theapartments occupied by the duke and told his domestics that their masterhad been killed in a duel and directed them to obtain assistance andproceed at once to the spot where his body would be found</s>  the colonelwent to the kings surgeon and told him of what had taken place</s> his death was instantaneous he said the sword passed right throughhim and i believe touched the heart</s>  however it will be as well thatyou should go and see the body as the king will be sure to askparticulars as to the wound</s> the rest of the party joined their acquaintances and told them what hadhappened and the news spread quickiy through the palace</s>  it created agreat sensation</s>  breaches of the edict were not unfrequent but the deathof so powerful a noble a chief favourite too of the king took italtogether out of the ordinary category of such events</s>  the more so sincethe dukes reputation as a swordsman and a duellist was so great that mencould scarce believe that he had been killed by a young officer who hadbut just joined the regiment</s>  it seemed like the story of david andgoliath over again</s>  a quarter of an hour later a court officialapproached colonel hume and the marquis de vallecourt who were standingtogether surrounded by a number of courtiers and officers</s> monsieur le marquis and colonel hume he said saluting them i regretto say that i am the bearer of the orders of his majesty that you shalldeliver me your swords and that you will then accompany me to the kingspresence</s> the two gentlemen handed over their swords to the official and followedhim to the kings presence</s>  louis was pacing angrily up and down hisapartment</s> what is this i hear gentlemen</s>  he exclaimed as they entered</s>  a breachof the edicts here at versailles almost in the boundaries of the parkand that the duc de chateaurouge one of my most valued officers andfriends has been killed they tell me that you acted as seconds in theaffair</s> they have told your majesty the truth the marquis said but i thinkthat much as we regret what has happened we could scarcely have actedotherwise than we did</s>  the duke drew in the first place within the limitsof the park and would have fought out his quarrel there had we not imay almost say forcibly intervened</s>  then he strode away towards theboundary of the park calling upon his antagonist to follow him and hadwe not gone the encounter would have taken place without seconds orwitnesses and might then have been called a murder instead of a duel</s> you should have arrested him sir the king exclaimed for drawing inthe park</s> perhaps we should have done so sire but you must please to rememberthat the duke of chateaurouge was of a temper not to be crossed and ibelieve that bloodshed would have taken place had we endeavoured tothwart him</s>  he enjoyed your majestys favour and a forcible arrest withperhaps the shedding of blood in the royal demesne would have been ascandal as grave as that of this duel</s> how did it come about</s>  the king asked abruptly</s> the duke was walking with de lisle st</s>  aignan and myself when wesuddenly came upon colonel hume with three of the officers of hisregiment</s>  the duke at once walked up to them and addressed colonel humeand finding which of his companions was monsieur leslie addressed him interms of so insulting a nature that they showed that he had been waitingfor the meeting to provoke a quarrel</s>  the young officer replied perfectlycalmly but with what i must call admirable spirit and courage which soinfuriated the duke that as i have already had the honour of tellingyour majesty he drew at once and when we interfered he called upon himto proceed forthwith outside the park and there settle the quarrel</s>  wemost reluctantly accompanied him and determined to interfere at thefirst blood drawn but the affair scarcely lasted for a second</s>  the dukethrew himself furiously and rashly upon the lad for as your majesty isaware he is but little more</s>  the latter standing firm parried withadmirable coolness and in an instant ran the duke right through thebody</s> but i have always heard the king said that the duke was one of thebest swordsmen in the army</s> your majesty has heard correctly colonel hume replied but youngleslie is one of the best swordsmen in france</s>  the dukes passion andrashness led to the speedy termination of the duel but had he foughtwith his accustomed coolness i believe that leslie would have turned outhis conqueror</s> but what was the cause of the quarrel</s>  why should the duc dechateaurouge fix a dispute as you tell me he did upon this officer ofyours</s> i believe sire that it was a long standing quarrel</s>  the dukes wordsshowed that he bore an enmity against the lads father and that it wason this account that he insulted the son</s> leslie</s>  the king exclaimed with a sudden recollection</s>  is that theyouth whom marshal saxe presented to me</s> the same sire the lad who distinguished himself at fontenoy and whomthe marshal afterwards appointed to a commission in my regiment in whichhe had served as a gentleman volunteer for nearly a year</s> these leslies are always causing trouble the king said angrily</s>  ihave already given orders that he shall be arrested wherever he is foundand he shall be punished as he deserves</s> in punishing him colonel hume said with grave deference i am surethat your majesty will not forget that this quarrel was forced upon himand that had he accepted the insults of the duke of chateaurouge hewould have been unworthy to remain an officer of your majesty</s> silence sir</s>  the king said angrily</s>  you will return immediately toparis under arrest until my pleasure in your case is notified to you</s>  ishall at once give orders that your troops here are replaced by those ofa regiment whose officers will abstain from brawling and breaking theedicts in our very palace</s>  marquis you will retire at once to yourestates</s>  the two gentlemen bowed and left the royal presence</s> not worse than i expected the marquis said after the door had closedbehind them</s>  now he will send for st</s>  aignan and de lisle and will heartheir account and as it cannot but tally with ours the king must seethat the duke brought his fate upon himself</s>  louis is not unjust when histemper cools down and in a few weeks we shall meet again here</s> i expect to be on the frontier with my regiment before that colonelhume replied but as i would rather be there than in paris that will beno hardship</s> colonel hume at once mounted and rode back to paris and proceededstraight to the hotel of marshal saxe to whom he communicated what hadoccurred</s> if leslie gets safely away it will perhaps all turn out for the bestthe marshal said</s>  as soon as the kings anger dies out i will begin toplead the cause of the boys parents and now that the influence ofchateaurouge the other way is withdrawn i may hope for a more favourablehearing</s>  as to the lad himself we will make his peace in a few months</s> the king is brave himself as he showed when under fire at fontenoy andhe admires bravery in others and when he has once got over the loss ofchateaurouge he will appreciate the skill and courage which the ladshowed in an encounter with one of the most noted duellists in france</s> now too that the duke has gone some of the stories to hisdisadvantage of which there are so many current are likely to meet thekings ears</s>  hitherto no one has ventured to speak a word against sopowerful a favourite but the kings eyes will soon be open now and hewill become ashamed of so long having given his countenance to a man whois generally regarded as having not only killed halfadozen men induels but as having procured the removal by unfair means of a score ofothers</s>  when he knows the truth the king is likely to do justice notonly to young leslie but to his parents</s>  i only hope that they will notmanage to overtake the lad before he reaches the frontier for although ican rely on the kings justice when he is cool i would not answer for itjust at present</s> as ronald rode off at full speed with malcolm he related to him the wholecircumstances of the quarrel and subsequent duel</s> it was well done ronald</s>  i made sure that sooner or later you and theduke would get to blows that is if he did not adopt other means to getyou removed from his path anyhow i am heartily glad its over and thatthe most dangerous enemy of your father and yourself is out of the way</s> and now we must hope that we shant be overtaken before we get to thefrontier</s>  the danger is that orders for your arrest will be passed bysignal</s> we are not going to the frontier malcolm i am only riding this way tothrow them off the scent</s>  we are going to nantes</s> well thats not a bad plan malcolm said</s>  they are not so likely tosend orders there as to the northern ports</s>  but it will not be easy toget a vessel to cross for you see now that we are at war with englandthere is little communication</s>  however we shall no doubt be able toarrange with a smuggler to take us across</s> we are not going to england malcolm we are going direct to scotland</s> colonel hume has told me a secret prince charles has gone down to nantesand is going to cross at once to scotland</s> what</s>  alone and without an army</s>  malcolm exclaimed in astonishment</s> i suppose he despairs of getting assistance from louis</s>  now thatfontenoy has put an end to danger on the frontier the king of france isno longer interested in raising trouble for george at home</s> but it is a mad scheme of the princes malcolm said gravely</s>  if hisfather did not succeed in 15 how can he expect to succeed now</s> the country has had all the longer time to get sick of the hanoveriansand the gallantry of the enterprise will appeal to the people</s>  besidesmalcolm i am not so sure that he will not do better coming alone than ifhe brought the fifteen thousand men he had at dunkirk last year with him</s> fifteen thousand men would not win him a kingdom and many who would joinhim if he came alone would not do so if he came backed by an army offoreigners</s>  it was the french you will remember who ruined hisgrandfathers cause in ireland</s>  their arrogance and interferencedisgusted the irish and their troops never did any fighting to speak of</s> for myself i would a thousand times rather follow prince charlesfighting with an army of scotsmen for the crown of scotland than fightfor him with a french army against englishmen</s> well perhaps you are right ronald it went against the grain atfontenoy for after all as you said we are closely akin in blood andlanguage to the english and although scotland and france have alwaysbeen allies it is very little good france has ever done us</s>  she hasalways been glad enough to get our kings to make war on england whenevershe wanted a diversion made but she has never put herself out of the wayto return the favour</s>  it has been a one sided alliance all along</s> scotland has for centuries been sending some of her best blood to fightas soldiers in france but with a few exceptions no frenchman has everdrawn his sword for scotland</s> no i am inclined to think you are right ronald and especially afterwhat we saw at fontenoy i have no wish ever to draw sword again againstthe english and am willing to be the best friends in the world with themif they will but let us scots have our own king and go away peacefully</s>  idont want to force prince charles upon them if they will but let us havehim for ourselves</s>  if they wont you know it is they who areresponsible for the quarrel not us</s> that is one way of putting it certainly ronald laughed</s>  i am afraidafter having been one kingdom since king james went to london they wontlet us go our own way without making an effort to keep us but here is acrossroad we will strike off here and make for the west</s> they avoided the towns on their routes for although they felt certainthat they were ahead of any messengers who might be sent out with ordersfor their arrest they knew that they might be detained for some littletime at nantes and were therefore anxious to leave no clue of theirpassage in that direction</s>  on the evening of the third day after startingthey approached their destination</s> on the first morning after leaving versailles they had halted in wood ashort distance from chartres and malcolm had ridden in alone and hadpurchased a suit of citizens clothes for ronald as the latters uniformas an officer of the scotch dragoons would at once have attracted notice</s> henceforward whenever they stopped malcolm had taken an opportunity tomention to the stable boy that he was accompanying his master the son ofan advocate of paris on a visit to some relatives in la vendee</s>  thisstory he repeated at the inn where they put up at nantes</s> the next morning malcolm went round to all the inns in the town butcould hear nothing of the duke of athole so he returned at noon with thenews of his want of success</s> they may have hired a private lodging to avoid observation ronaldsaid or not improbably may have taken another name</s>  the best thing wecan do is to go down to the river side inquire what vessels are likelyto leave port soon and then if we see anyone going off to them toaccost them</s>  we may hear of them in that way</s> accordingly they made their way down to the river</s>  there were severalvessels lying in the stream in readiness to sail when the wind servedand the mouth of the river was reported to be clear of any englishcruisers</s>  they made inquiries as to the destination of the vessels</s>  allthe large ones were sailing for bordeaux or the mediterranean ports offrance</s> what is that little vessel lying apart from the rest</s>  malcolm asked</s> she looks a saucy little craft</s> that is the privateer la doutelle one of the fastest little vessels onthe coast</s>  she has brought in more than one english merchantman as aprize</s> as they were speaking a boat was seen to leave her side and make for theshore</s>  with a glance at malcolm to break off his conversation with thesailor and follow him ronald strode along the bank towards the spotwhere the boat would land</s>  two gentlemen got out and advanced along thequay</s>  as they passed ronald said to malcolmi know one of those mens faces</s> do you ronald</s>  i cannot recall having seen them</s> ronald stood for a moment in thought</s> i know now</s>  he exclaimed</s>  and he is one of our men sure enough</s> i think sir he said as he came up to them that i have had thehonour of meeting you before</s> a look of displeasure came across the gentlemans face</s> i think you are mistaken sir he said coldly</s>  you must take me forsome one else</s>  my name is verbois  monsieur verbois of le mans</s> i have not the pleasure of knowing monsieur verbois ronald said with aslight smile but i hardly think sir that that is the name that youwent by when i had the honour of meeting you in glasgow more than twoyears ago</s> in glasgow</s>  the gentleman said looking earnestly at ronald</s>  inglasgow</s>  i do not remember you</s> i had the pleasure of doing you some slight service neverthelessronald said quietly when i brought you news that your enemies were uponyou and managed to detain them while you made your escape through theattic window</s> a thousand pardons</s>  the gentleman exclaimed speaking in english</s>  howcould i have forgotten you</s>  but i saw you for such a short time and twoyears have changed you greatly</s>  this is the young gentleman marquis towhom i am indebted for my escape when i was so nearly captured atglasgow as you have heard me say</s>  it was to his kindly warning in thefirst place and to his courage in the second that i owed my liberty</s>  itis wonderful that you should remember me</s> two years have not changed you as much as they have changed me ronaldsaid besides you were busy in destroying papers while i had nothingto do but to watch you</s> that is so the gentleman agreed</s>  at any rate i am heartily glad ofthe happy chance which has thrown us together and has given me anopportunity of expressing to you the deep gratitude which i have felt foryour warning and assistance</s>  had it not been for that not only should imyself have been taken but they would have got possession of thosepapers which might have brought the heads of a score of the best bloodof scotland to the scaffold</s>  i took a boat that was lying in readinessand making down the river got on board a ship which was cruising thereawaiting me and got off</s>  it has always been a matter of bitter regret tome that i never learned so much as the name of the brave young gentlemanto whom i owed so much or what had happened to him for his share in thatnights work</s> my name is ronald leslie sir</s>  i am the son of leslie of glenlyon whofought with the chevalier in 15 and afterwards entered the service ofthe king of france and was colonel of the 2nd scorch dragoons</s> of course i knew him well the gentleman said and with othersendeavoured to obtain his pardon when he fell under the kingsdispleasure some fifteen years ago although i regret to say withoutsuccess</s>  believe me if prince charles  he stopped suddenly as hiscompanion touched him</s> you would say sir ronald said with a smile if prince charlessucceeds in his present enterprise and regains his throne you will gethim to exert his influence to obtain my fathers release</s> the two gentlemen gave an exclamation of astonishment</s> how do you know of any enterprise that is meditated</s> i was told of it as a secret by a scotch officer in paris and am thebearer of a message from him to the duke of athole to ask him to allowme to join the prince</s> i am the duke the other gentleman said</s> since it is you sir i may tell you that the officer i spoke of iscolonel hume and that he bade me show you this ring which he said youwould know as a token that my story was a correct one</s> hume is my greatest friend the duke exclaimed and his introductionwould be sufficient even if you had not already proved your devotion tothe cause of the stuarts</s>  i will take you at once to the prince</s>  but hesaid before i do so i must tell you that the enterprise upon which weare about to embark is a desperate one</s>  the prince has but fivecompanions with him and we embark on board that little privateer lyingin the stream</s>  it is true that we shall be escorted by a man of warwhich will convey the arms which prince charles has purchased for theenterprise but not a man goes with us and the prince is about to trustwholly to the loyalty of scotland</s> i shall be ready to accompany him in any case sir ronald said and ibeg to introduce to you a faithful friend of my father and myself</s>  hisname is malcolm anderson</s>  he fought for the chevalier in 15 andaccompanied my father in his flight to france and served under him inthe french service</s>  upon the occasion of my fathers arrest he carried meto scotland and has been my faithful friend ever since</s> so saying he called malcolm up and presented him to the duke and theparty then proceeded to the lodging where prince charles was staying</s> i have the misfortune to be still ignorant of your name sir ronaldsaid to his acquaintance of glasgow</s> what</s>  the gentleman said in surprise</s>  you do not know my name afterdoing so much for me</s>  i thought as a matter of course that when youwere captured for aiding my escape you would have heard it hence myremissness in not introducing myself</s>  i am colonel macdonald</s>  when youmet me i was engaged in a tour through the highland clans sounding thechiefs and obtaining

received early news of the advance from stirlinghad recognized the importance of the position and having burned anddestroyed all baggage that would impede his progress made a forced marchand reached

displeasing to the prince andconscious of his own military genius and experience put aside with opencontempt the suggestions of those who were in truth ignorant of militarymatters</s>  loyal straightforward and upright he scorned to descend tothe arts of the courtier and while devoting his whole time to hismilitary work suffered his enemies to obtain the entire command of theear of the prince</s> ronald was introduced to him as soon as he joined at perth and findingthat young leslie had had some military experience lord george at onceappointed him one of his aides de camp and soon took a warm liking tothe active and energetic young officer whose whole soul was in his workand who cared nothing for the courtly gatherings around the person of theprince</s> malcolm rode as ronalds orderly and during the few days of their stayin perth ronald was at work from morning till night riding through thecountry with messages from lord george and in the intervals of such dutyin trying to inculcate some idea of discipline into the wild highlandlevies</s>  at this time charles was using all his efforts to persuade lordlovat one of the most powerful of the northern noblemen to join himoffering him his patent as duke of fraser and the lord lieutenancy of thenorthern counties</s> lovat however an utterly unscrupulous man refused openly to joinalthough he sent repeatedly assurances of his devotion</s>  throughout thestruggle he continued to act a double part trying to keep friends withboth parties but declaring for the prince at the moment when hisfortunes were at their highest</s>  the result was that while he afforded theprince but little real assistance his conduct cost him his head</s> sir john cope finding that his march to inverness had failed to draw theprince after him and had left the lowlands and the capital open to theinsurgents directed his march to aberdeen and sent to edinburgh fortransports to bring down his army to cover that city</s>  but prince charlesdetermined to forestall him and on the 11th of september commenced hismarch south</s>  the age and infirmities of the marquis of tullibardineprevented his accompanying prince charles during active operations</s> it was impossible for the army to march direct against edinburgh as themagistrates of that town had taken the precaution to withdraw every shipand boat from the northern side of the forth and the prince wasconsequently obliged to make a detour and to cross the river at the fordseight miles above stirling and then marching rapidly towards edinburgharrived on the evening of the 16th within three miles of that town</s> so long as the coming of the prince was doubtful the citizens ofedinburgh had declared their willingness to defend the town to the last</s> volunteer regiments had been formed and guns placed on the walls butwhen the volunteers were ordered to march out with hamiltons regiment ofdragoons to oppose the advance of the insurgents the men quitted theirranks and stole away to their houses leaving the dragoons to march outalone</s>  the latter however showed no greater courage than that of theircitizen allies when on the following day they came in contact with aparty of mounted gentlemen from the princes army who fired theirpistols at their pickets</s>  these rode off in haste their panic wascommunicated to the main body whose officers in vain endeavoured tocheck them and the whole regiment galloped away in wild confusion andpassing close under the walls of edinburgh continued their flightwithout halting to preston</s>  there they halted for the night but one ofthe troopers happening in the dark to fall into a disused well hisshouts for assistance caused an alarm that they were attacked andmounting their horses the regiment continued their flight to dunbarwhere they joined general copes army which had just landed there</s> this disgraceful panic added to the terror of the citizens of edinburghand when late in the afternoon a summons to surrender came in fromprince charles the council could arrive at no decision but sent adeputation to the prince asking for delay hoping thereby that copesarmy would arrive in time to save them</s>  but the prince was also wellaware of the importance of time and that night he sent forward lochielwith five hundred camerons to lie in ambush near the netherbow gate</s>  theytook with them a barrel of powder to blow it in if necessary but in themorning the gate was opened to admit a carriage and the highlanders atonce rushed in and overpowered the guard and sending parties through thestreets they secured these also without disturbance or bloodshed andwhen the citizens awoke in the morning they found to their surprisethat prince charles was master of the city</s> the jacobite portion of the population turned out with delight to greetthe prince while the rest thought it politic to imitate theirenthusiasm</s>  the highlanders behaved with perfect order and disciplineand although the town had as it were been taken by storm no singlearticle of property was touched</s>  an hour later prince charles at thehead of his troops entered the royal palace of holyrod being met by acrowd of enthusiastic supporters from the city who received him withroyal shouts and tears of joy</s> in the evening a grand ball was held in the palace in spite of the factthat it was within range of the guns of edinburgh castle which stillheld out</s>  but one day was spent in edinburgh</s>  this was occupied inserving out about a thousand muskets found in the magazines to thehighlanders and in obtaining tents shoes and cooking vessels whichthe town was ordered to supply</s>  they were joined during the day by manygentlemen and on the night of the 19th the army two thousand fivehundred strong of whom only fifty were mounted moved out to the villageof duddingston</s>  there the prince that evening called a council of warand proposed to march next morning to meet the enemy halfway anddeclared that he would himself lead his troops and charge in the firstranks</s> the chiefs however exclaimed against this urging that if any accidenthappened to him ruin must fall upon the whole whether they gained orlost the battle and upon the prince persisting they declared that theywould return home and make the best terms they could for themselves</s>  hewas therefore obliged to give way declaring however that he would leadthe second line</s>  the next morning the army commenced its march</s>  they hadwith them only one cannon so old that it was quite useless and it wasonly taken forward as an encouragement to the highlanders who had thegreatest respect for artillery</s> sir john cope who had received intelligence of all that had happened atedinburgh had also moved forward on the 19th and on the 20th the twoarmies came in sight of each other</s>  the highlanders after passing thebridge of musselburgh left the road and turning to the right took uptheir position on the brow of carberry hill and there waited the attack</s> the english forces were marching forward with high spirit and believedthat the highlanders would not even wait their assault</s>  cope had with himtwo thousand two hundred men including the six hundred runaway dragoons</s> the numbers therefore were nearly equal but as the english were wellarmed disciplined and equipped while only about half the highlandershad muskets and as they had moreover six pieces of artillery againstthe one unserviceable gun of prince charles they had every reason toconsider the victory to be certain</s> on seeing the highland array cope drew up his troops in order of battle his infantry in the centre with a regiment of dragoons and threepieces of artillery on each flank</s>  his right was covered by a park walland by the village of preston</s>  on his left stood seaton house and in hisrear lay the sea with the villages of prestonpans and cockenzie</s>  theirfront was covered by a deep and difficult morass</s> it was now about three oclock in the afternoon and the highlandersseeing that the english did not advance against them clamoured to be ledto the attack</s>  prince charles was himself eager to fight but hisgenerals persuaded him to abstain from attacking the english in such aformidable position</s>  the highlanders however fearing that the englishwould again avoid a battle were not satisfied until lord nairn with fivehundred men was detached to the westward to prevent the english frommarching off towards edinburgh</s> during the night the two armies lay upon the ground</s>  cope retired tosleep at cockenzie the prince lay down in the middle of his soldiers</s> before doing so however he held a council and determined to attacknext morning in spite of the difficulty of the morass</s>  but in the courseof the night anderson of whitburg a gentleman well acquainted with thecountry bethought himself of a path from the height towards their rightby the farm of ruigan head which in a great measure avoided the morass</s> this important fact he imparted to lord george murray who at once awokethe prince</s> locheil and some other chiefs were sent for and it was determined toundertake the enterprise at once</s>  an aide de camp was sent to recall lordnairn and his detachment and under the guidance of anderson the troopsmade their way across the morass</s>  this was not however accomplishedwithout great difficulty as in some places they sank knee deep</s>  themarch was unopposed and covered by the darkness they made their wayacross to firm ground just as the day was breaking dull and foggy</s>  asthey did so however the dragoon outposts heard the sound of theirmarch and firing their pistols galloped off to give the alarm</s>  sir johncope lost no time facing his troops about and forming them in order ofbattle</s>  he was undisturbed while doing so for the highlanders weresimilarly occupied</s> as the sun rose the mist cleared away and the two armies stood face toface</s>  the macdonalds had been granted the post of honour on the highlandright the line being completed by the camerons and stuarts princecharles with the second line being close behind</s>  the highlandersuncovered their heads uttered a short prayer and then as the pipersblew the signal they rushed forward each clan in a separate mass andraising their war cry the camerons and stuarts rushed straight at thecannon on the left</s> these guns were served not by royal artillerymen but by some seamenbrought by cope from the fleet</s>  they panic struck by the wild rush ofthe highlanders deserted their guns and fled in all directions</s>  colonelgardiner called upon his dragoons to follow him and with his officersled them to the charge</s>  but the stuarts and camerons pouring in a volleyfrom their muskets charged them with their broadswords and thedragoons panic stricken turned their horses and galloped off</s> the macdonalds on the right had similarly captured three guns andcharging with similar fury upon hamiltons regiment of dragoons drovethem off the field macgregors company who for want of other weaponswere armed with scythes doing terrible execution among the horses andtheir riders</s>  the english infantry deserted by their cavalry and withtheir guns lost still stood firm and poured a heavy fire into thehighlanders but these as soon as they had defeated the cavalry facedround and charged with fury upon both flanks of the infantry</s>  theironslaught was irresistible</s>  the heavy masses of the clans broke rightthrough the long line of the english infantry and drove the latterbackward in utter confusion</s>  but the retreat was impeded by the inclosureand park wall of preston and the highlanders pressing on the greaterportion of the english infantry were killed or taken prisoners</s> a hundred and seventy of the infantry alone succeeded in making theirescape four hundred were killed and the rest captured</s>  colonel gardinerand many of his officers were killed fighting bravely but the loss ofthe dragoons was small</s>  only thirty of the highlanders were killed andseventy wounded</s>  the battle lasted but six minutes and the moment it hadterminated prince charles exerted himself to the utmost to obtain mercyfor the vanquished</s> he treated the prisoners with the greatest kindness and considerationand the wounded were relieved without any distinction of friend or foe</s> the dragoons fled to edinburgh and dashed up the hill to the castle butthe governor refused to admit them and threatened to open his guns uponthem as cowards who had deserted their colours</s>  later on in the day thegreater portion were rallied by sir john cope and the earls of loudon andhome but being seized with a fresh panic they galloped on again at fullspeed as far as coldstream and the next morning continued their flightin a state of disgraceful disorder as far as berwick</s>  the contents of thetreasure chest consisting of two thousand five hundred pounds with thestandards and other trophies were brought to prince charles</s>  the rest ofthe spoil was divided among the highlanders of whom a great numberimmediately set off towards their homes to place the articles they hadgathered in safety</s> so greatly was the highland army weakened by the number of men who thusleft the ranks that the prince was unable to carry out his wish for aninstant advance into england</s>  his advisers indeed were opposed to thismeasure urging that in a short time his force would be swelled bythousands from all parts of scotland but unquestionably his own view wasthe correct one and had he marched south he would probably have met withno resistance whatever on his march to london</s>  there were but few troopsin england</s>  a requisition had been sent to the dutch by king george forthe six thousand auxiliaries they were bound to furnish and a resolutionwas taken to recall ten english regiments home from flanders</s> marshal wade was directed to collect as many troops as he could atnewcastle and the militia of several counties was called out but thepeople in no degree responded to the efforts of the government</s>  theylooked on coldly not indeed apparently favouring the rebellion but aslittle disposed to take part against it</s>  the state of public feeling wasdescribed at the time by a member of the administration henry fox in aprivate letter</s> england wade says and i believe is for the first comer and if youcan tell me whether these six thousand dutch and the ten battalions ofengland or five thousand french or spaniards will be here first youknow our fate</s>  the french are not come god be thanked but had fivethousand landed in any part of this island a week ago i verily believethe entire conquest would not have cost a battle</s> the prince indeed was doing his best to obtain assistance from franceconscious how much his final success depended upon french succour</s> king louis for a time appeared favourable</s>  the princes brother henry ofyork had arrived from rome and the king proposed to place him at thehead of the irish regiments in the kings service and several others toenable him to effect a landing in england but with his usual insinceritythe french king continued to raise difficulties and cause delays until itwas too late and he thus lost for ever the chance of placing the familywho had always been warm friends of france and who would in the event ofsuccess have been his natural friends and allies on the throne ofengland</s> in the meantime prince charles had taken up his abode in edinburgh wherehe was joined by most of the gentry of scotland</s>  he was proclaimed kingin almost every town of the tweed and was master of all scotland savesome districts beyond inverness the highland forts and the castles ofedinburgh and stirling</s> </s>  prince charles behaved with the greatestmoderation</s>  he forbade all public rejoicing for victory saying that hecould not rejoice over the loss which his fathers misguided subjects hadsustained</s>  he abstained from any attempt to capture edinburgh castle oreven to cut off its supplies because the general of the castlethreatened that unless he were allowed to obtain provisions he would fireupon the city and lay it in ruins and he even refused to interfere witha scotch minister who continued from his pulpit to pray for king george</s> in one respect he carried his generosity so far as to excite discontentamong his followers</s>  it was proposed to send one of the prisoners takenat preston to london with a demand for the exchange of prisoners taken orto be taken in the war and with the declaration that if this wererefused and if the princes friends who fell into the enemys hands wereput to death as rebels the prince would be compelled to treat hiscaptives in the same way</s>  it was evident that this step would be of greatutility as many of the princes adherents hesitated to take up arms notfrom fear of death in battle but of execution if taken prisoners</s> the prince however steadily refused saying it is beneath me to makeempty threats and i will never put such as this into execution</s>  i cannotin cold blood take away lives which i have saved in the heat of action</s> six weeks after the victory the princes army mustered nearly sixthousand men but macleod macdonald and lovat who could have brought afurther force of four thousand men still held aloof</s>  had these threepowerful chiefs joined at once after the battle of prestonpans princecharles could have marched to london and would probably have succeededin placing his father on the throne without having occasion to strikeanother blow but they came not and the delay caused during thefruitless negotiations enabled the english troops to be brought over fromflanders while prince charles on his side only received a few smallconsignments of arms and money from france</s> but in the meantime edinburgh was as gay as if the stuart cause had beenalready won</s>  receptions and balls followed each other in closesuccession and prince charles won the hearts of all alike by hiscourtesy and kindness and by the care which he showed for the comfort ofhis troops</s> at the commencement of the campaign lord george murray had but one aidede camp besides ronald</s>  this was an officer known as the chevalier dejohnstone who afterwards wrote a history of the campaign</s>  after thebattle of prestonpans he received a captains commission and immediatelyraised a company with which he joined the duke of perths regiment</s>  twoother gentlemen of family were then appointed aides de camp and thisafforded some relief to ronald whose duties had been extremely heavy</s> a week after the battle lord george said to ronaldas there is now no chance of a movement at present and i know that youcare nothing for the court festivities here i propose sending you withthe officers who are riding into glasgow tomorrow with the orders of thecouncil that the city shall pay a subsidy of five thousand pounds towardsthe necessities of the state</s>  the citizens are hanoverians to a man andmay think themselves well off that no heavier charge is levied upon them</s> do you take an account of what warlike stores there are in the magazinesthere and see that all muskets and ammunition are packed up andforwarded</s> the next morning ronald started at daybreak with several other mountedgentlemen and an escort of a hundred of clanranalds men under thecommand of the eldest son of that chief for glasgow and late the sameevening entered that city</s>  they were received with acclamation by a partof the population but the larger portion of the citizens gazed at themfrom their doorways as they passed in sullen hostility</s>  they marcheddirect to the barracks lately occupied by the english troops thegentlemen taking the quarters occupied by the officers</s>  a notificationwas at once sent to the provost to assemble the city council at nineoclock in the morning to hear a communication from the royal council</s> as soon as malcolm had put up ronalds horse and his own in the stablesand seen to their comfort he and ronald sallied out</s>  it was now darkbut they wrapped themselves up in their cloaks so as not to be noticedas in the hostile state of the town they might have been insulted and aquarrel forced upon them had they been recognized as two of the newarrivals</s>  the night however was dark and they passed withoutrecognition through the ill lighted streets to the house of andrewanderson</s>  they rang at the bell</s>  a minute later the grille was openedand a voice which they recognized as that of elspeth asked who wasthere and what was their business</s> we come to arrest one elspeth dow as one who troubles the state and isa traitor to his majesty</s> there was an exclamation from within and the door suddenly opened</s>
i know your voice bairn</s>  the lord be praised that you have come backhome again</s>  and she was about to run forward when she checked herself</s> is it yourself ronald</s> it is no one else elspeth he replied giving the old woman a heartykiss</s> and such a man as you have grown</s>  she exclaimed in surprise</s>  for thetwo years had added several inches to ronalds stature and he now stoodover six feet in height</s> and have you no welcome for me elspeth</s>  malcolm asked coming forward</s> the lord preserve us</s>  elspeth exclaimed</s>  why its my boy malcolm</s> turned up again like a bad penny you see elspeth</s> what is it elspeth</s>  andrews voice called from above</s>  who are thesemen you are talking to and what do they want at this time of night</s> they want some supper andrew malcolm called back and that badly</s> in a moment andrew ran down and clasped his brothers hand</s>  in thedarkness he did not notice malcolms companion and after the firstgreeting with his brother led the way up stairs</s> it is my brother malcolm he said to his wife as he entered the room</s> ronald followed malcolm forward</s>  as the light fell on his face andrewstarted and as ronald smiled ran forward and clasped him in his arms</s> it is ronald wife</s>  ah my boy have you come back to us again</s> mrs</s>  anderson received ronald with motherly kindness</s> we had heard of your escape before your letter came to us from paris</s> our city constables brought back the news of how you had jumpedoverboard and had been pulled into a boat and disappeared</s>  and finelythey were laughed at when they told their tale</s>  then came your lettersaying that it was malcolm who had met you with the boat and how you hadsailed away and been wrecked on the coast of france but since then wehave heard nothing</s> i wrote twice ronald said but owing to the war there have been noregular communications and i suppose my letters got lost</s> and i suppose you have both come over to have a hand in this madenterprise</s> i dont know whether it is mad or not andrew but we have certainlycome over to have a hand in it malcolm said</s>  and now before we have aregular talk let me tell you that we are famishing</s>  i know your supperis long since over but doubtless elspeth has still something to eat inher cupboard</s>  oh here she comes</s> elspeth soon placed a joint of cold meat upon the table and ronald andmalcolm set to at once to satisfy their hunger</s>  then a jar of whiskey andglasses were set upon the table and pipes lighted and ronald began adetailed narration of all that had taken place since they had last met</s> had my father and mother known that i was coming to scotland and shouldhave an opportunity of seeing you both they would have sent you theirwarmest thanks and gratitude for your kindness to me he concluded</s>  forover and over again have i heard them say how deeply they felt indebtedto you for your care of me during so many years and how they wished thatthey could see you and thank you in person</s> what we did was done in the first place for my brother malcolm andafterwards for love of you ronald and right glad i am to hear that youobtained the freedom of your parents and a commission as an officer inthe service of the king of france</s>  i would be glad that you had come overhere on any other errand than that which brings you</s>  things have gone onwell with you so far but how will they end</s>  i hear that the jacobites ofengland are not stirring and you do not think that with a few thousandhighland clansmen you are going to conquer the english army that beat thefrench at dettingen and well nigh overcame them at fontenoy</s>  ah lad itwill prove a sore day for scotland when charles stuart set foot on oursoil</s> we wont talk about that now andrew malcolm said good temperedly</s> the matter has got to be fought out with the sword and if our tongueswere to wag all night they could make no difference one way or another</s> so let us not touch upon politics</s>  but i must say that as far as ronaldand i are concerned we did not embark on this expedition because we hadat the moment any great intention of turning hanoverian george off histhrone but simply because ronald had made france too hot to hold himand this was the simplest way that presented itself of getting out of thecountry</s>  as long as there are blows to be struck we shall do our best</s> when there is no more fighting to be done either because king james isseated on his throne in london or because the clans are scattered andbroken we shall make for france again where by that time i hope theking will have got over the breach of his edict and the killing of hisfavourite and where ronalds father and mother will be longing for hispresence</s> eh but its awful sirs elspeth who as an old and favourite servanthad remained in the room after laying the supper and listened to theconversation put in to think that a young gallant like our ronaldshould have slain a man</s>  he who ought not yet to have done with hislearning to be going about into wars and battles and to have stood upagainst a great french noble and slain him</s>  eh but its awful to thinkof</s> it would be much more awful elspeth if the french noble had killed meat least from the light in which i look at it</s> thats true enough elspeth said</s>  and if he wanted to kill you and itdoes seem from what you say that he did want of course i cannot blameyou for killing him but to us quiet bodies here in glasgow it seems anawful affair though after you got in a broil here and drew on the citywatch i ought not to be surprised at anything</s> and now we must go ronald said rising</s>  it is well nigh midnight andtime for all decent people to be in bed</s> chapter xv a mission</s> the next morning early ronald proceeded to take an inventory of the armsand ammunition left behind by the troops when they had marched to joinsir john cope at stirling</s>  having done this he saw that they were allpacked up in readiness to be sent off the next day under the escort whowere also to convey the money which the city was required to pay</s>  for theprovost and council knowing that it was useless to resist the order andperhaps anxious in the present doubtful state of affairs to stand wellwith prince charles had arranged that the money should be forthcoming ofthe following morning</s>  after his work was over ronald again spent theevening at andrew andersons</s> the next morning he returned to edinburgh with the arms and escort</s>  itwas late when he arrived but as he knew that lord george murray would beat work in his tent he repaired there at once</s> we have brought back the money and arms lord george</s>  i have handed overthe arms and ammunition at the magazine tent and those in charge of themoney have gone into the town with a part of the escort to give it overto the treasurer</s> how many arms did you get</s> two hundred and twentythree muskets and eighty pistols fourteen kegsof gunpowder and well nigh a ton of lead</s> that is more than i had expected</s>  and now leslie i have an importantmission for you</s>  the prince this morning asked me whom i could recommendas a sure and careful person likely to do the business well to go downinto lancashire to visit the leading jacobites there and urge them totake up arms</s>  i said that i knew of none who would be more likely tosucceed than yourself</s>  your residence of two years in france has rubbedoff any scotch dialect you may have had and at any rate you could passfor a northern englishman</s>  in the next place your youth would enable youto pass unsuspected where an older man might be questioned</s>  the princeagreed at once and took shame to himself that he had not before givenpromotion to one who was his companion on his voyage to scotland themore so as he had made johnstone a captain</s>  your claims are far greaterthan his and moreover you have served as an officer in the french army</s> but in truth the fault is in some degree your own for you spend allyour time in carrying out your duties and do not show yourself at any ofthe levees or festivities</s>  and you know with princes as with otherpeople out of sight is out of mind</s>  however the prince at once tooksteps to repair the omission and has signed your commission as captain</s> here it is</s>  you will understand of course that it is for past servicesand that you are perfectly free to decline this mission to the south ifyou would rather not undertake it</s>  it is unquestionably a dangerous one</s> i will undertake it readily sir ronald said and i thank yousincerely for bringing my name before the prince and the prince himselffor his kindness in granting me his commission which so far i have donebut little to win</s>  i shall be able i trust to carry out this mission tohis satisfaction and although i am ignorant of the country i shall havethe advantage of taking with me my brave follower malcolm anderson whofor years was in the habit of going with droves of cattle down intolancashire and will not only know the country but have acquaintancesthere and being known as a drover would pass without suspicion of hisbeing engaged with politics</s> that will do well lord george said</s>  i will get the list of persons onwhom you should call prepared tomorrow</s>  you had best go to sir thomassheridan and francis strickland who came over with you and get them topresent you to secretary murray and recommend you to him</s>  if he hearsthat your mission is of my recommendation he will do all he can to setthe prince against you</s>  everything that i do is wrong in his eyes and ido believe that he would ruin the cause in order to injure me did he seeno other way to accomplish that end</s>  therefore if he mentions my nameas he is like to do knowing that you have been my aide de camp be surethat you say nought in my favour or it will ruin you with him</s>  you willof course attend the princes levee tomorrow and had best makepreparation to start at nightfall</s> the next day accordingly ronald called upon sir thomas sheridan andstrickland and telling them that the prince had determined to send himon a mission into lancashire asked them to present him to secretarymurray from whom he would receive orders for his guidance andinstruction as to the persons whom he was to visit</s>  the two gentlemenproceeded with him to the house in which secretary murray had taken uphis abode and introduced him with much warmth as a fellow passenger onboard the doutelle</s> you have been serving since as lord murrays aide de camp</s> yes sir the prince recommended me to him at perth and i have sincehad the honour to carry his orders</s> captain leslie for so the prince has granted him a commission sirthomas said has served two years in the french army and was present atdettingen and fontenoy</s>  he mentioned to me on the voyage that he had thehonour of being presented by marshal saxe to the king of france and thathe received his commission from the marshal to whom he had acted as aidede camp at fontenoy</s> you have begun well indeed young sir murray said to have receivedat your age for i judge that you are not yet twenty commissions in thefrench army and ours</s> ronald bowed</s> he has another claim upon all you scottish gentlemen sir thomas saidfor colonel macdonald told us when he introduced him to us at nantesthat it was through his interference and aid alone that he escaped safelyfrom glasgow and that all his papers with the names of the kingsfriends in scotland did not fall into georges hands</s>  he was takenprisoner for his share in that affair but escaped from the ship in thethames and succeeded in crossing to france</s>  so you see young as he ishe has rendered good service to the cause</s> the expression of the secretarys face which had before been cold anddistant changed at once</s>  he had been aware that ronald had been chosenfor this business on the recommendation of lord george murray and hisjealousy of that nobleman had at once set him against ronald of whoseantecedents he was entirely ignorant but what he now heard entirelyaltered the case and disposed him most favourably towards himespecially as his own name would have been one of the most prominent inthe list he having been in constant communication with colonel macdonaldduring the stay of the latter in scotland</s> i had no idea it was to you that we are all so indebted he saidwarmly</s>  i heard from colonel macdonald after his return from francethat he owed his escape entirely to the quickness and bravery of a younggentleman of whose name he was ignorant but who he feared would sufferfor his interference on his behalf and prayed me and all other loyalgentlemen of scotland to befriend you should they ever discover yourname for that we assuredly owed it to you that we escaped imprisonmentif not worse</s>  i am truly glad to meet you and thank you in person</s>  and soyou are going on this mission</s> i have undertaken to do my best sir</s>  fortunately i have a faithfulfollower who fought beside my father in 15 followed him to france andfought by his side in the scottish dragoons for fifteen years and whohas since been my best friend</s>  he worked for years when i was a childas a drover of cattle from the highlands into england</s>  he knowscumberland and lancashire well and would be known at every wayside inn</s> he will accompany me and i shall pass as his nephew therefore nosuspicion will be likely to light upon me</s> and you set out tonight</s> yes sir if my orders and letters are ready</s> there will not be many letters the secretary said</s>  it would not dofor you to have documents upon you which might betray you and our friendsthere should you be arrested</s>  i will give you a list of the gentlemen onwhom you have to call which you had best learn by heart and destroybefore you cross the frontier</s>  you shall have one paper only and thatwritten so small that it can be carried in a quill</s>  this you can show toone after the other</s>  if you find you are in danger of arrest you candestroy or swallow it</s>  i will give them to you at the princes levee thisafternoon and will send to your tent a purse of gold for your expenses</s> i shall need but little for that sir ronald said smiling</s> for your expenses no the secretary said but one never can say whatmoney may be required for</s>  you may have to buy fresh horses you may wantit to bribe someone to conceal you</s>  money is always useful my youngfriend</s>  by the way what family of leslies do you belong to</s>  i heard thatone of your name had accompanied the prince but no more</s> my father was leslie of glenlyon</s> indeed</s>  the secretary exclaimed</s>  of course i know the name well</s>  thelands were confiscated but we shall soon set that right and i will seethat they are added to when the time comes to reward the kings friendsand punish his foes</s> ronald now took his leave and returned to malcolm who was makingpreparation for the enterprise</s>  he had already purchased two suits ofclothes such as would be worn by lowland drovers and was in highspirits being more elated than was ronald himself at the latterspromotion</s>  in the course of the day he bought two rough ponies as beingmore suitable for the position they were to assume than the horses withwhich they had been furnished at perth</s>  ronald attended the levee andthanked the prince for the favour which he bestowed upon him</s> you are a young gentleman after my own heart prince charles said andi promised myself on shipboard that we should be great friends but ihave been so busy since i landed and you have been so occupied in myservice that i have seen but little of you</s>  on your return i hope that ishall be able to have you near my person</s>  i am half jealous of you forwhile you are younger than i am you have seen good service and taken partin great battles but hitherto i have led a life almost of idleness</s> ronald bowed deeply at the princes gracious speech</s>  on his return to histent he found a messenger from the secretary with a purse which oncounting its contents they found to amount to a hundred guineas</s> they started immediately and travelled twenty miles before stopping forthe night at a small wayside inn</s> this seems like old times to me malcolm said as after eating supperthey sat by a turf fire except that on my way down i had the herd tolook after</s>  there is no fear of our being questioned or suspected till wereach the border for there is not an english soldier between the forthand the tweed nor is it likely that we shall meet with any difficultywhatever till we get to carlisle</s>  copes forces or what remain of themare at newcastle and it will be there that the english will gather andthe western road is likely to be open until at any rate prince charlesmoves south</s>  georges troops have plenty to think about withoutinterfering with the lowlands drovers</s>  at the same time after we haveonce crossed the tweed we may as well leave the high road</s>  i know everybypath over the fells</s> on the third day after starting they crossed the border and were amongthe hills of cumberland</s>  they found that among the villages greatapprehension existed</s>  the tales of the rapine and destruction wrought inthe old times by the scottish forays had been handed down from father toson and nothing less than the destruction of their homes and the loss oftheir flocks and herds was looked for</s>  malcolm was welcomed warmly at thelittle village inn where they put up for the night</s> why its well nigh three years since i saw you last the host saidand before that it was seldom two months without our seeing you</s>  whathave you been doing with yourself</s> i have been gathering the herds in the highlands malcolm said whileothers have driven them down for sale but at present my occupation isgone</s>  the highlanders are swarming like angry bees whose hive has beendisturbed and even if we could collect a herd it would not be safe todrive it south it would be seized and despatched to edinburgh for theuse of the clans there</s> is it true that there are fifty thousand of them and that they havesworn to kill every english man woman and child</s> no they are not so strong as that malcolm said</s>  from what i hear ishould say they were not more than half and i do not think there is anyoccasion for peaceful people to be afraid for they say that the princehas treated all the prisoners who fell into his hands in the kindestmanner and that he said that the english are his fathers subjects aswell as the scots and that he will see that harm is done to no man</s> i am right glad to hear it the innkeeper said</s>  i dont know that i ammuch afraid myself but my wife and daughter are in a terrible frightand wanted me to quit the house and go south till it is all over</s> there is no occasion for that man malcolm said you will have noreason for fear were the whole of the clans to march through yourvillage unless you took it into your head to stand at the door andshout god bless king george</s> i care not a fig about king george or king james the man said</s>  itsnought to me who is king at london and as far as i know thats the waywith all here</s>  let them fight it out together and leave us hard workingfolks to ourselves</s> i dont suppose either james or george would care for that malcolmsaid laughing but from what i have heard of prince charles i should saythat there is nothing in the world that he would like better than tostand with broadsword or dagger against the duke of cumberland and sosettle the dispute</s> that would be the most sensible thing to my mind the innkeeper saidbut what brings you here anderson since you have no herd with you</s> i am just getting out of it all malcolm said</s>  i have had my share ofhard knocks and want no more of them</s>  i dont want to quarrel withhighlanders or lowlanders and as trade is at a standstill at presentand theres nothing for me to do in the highlands i thought i would comesouth till it was all over</s>  there is money to collect and things to lookafter and i have to notify to our regular customers that the herds willcome down again as soon as the tempest is over and between ourselveshe said in a lower voice i wanted to get my nephew out of harms way</s> he has a hankering to join the princes army and i dont want to let himget his brains knocked out in a quarrel which isnt his so i havebrought him along with me</s> he is a good looking young fellow i can see and a strong one</s>  i dontwonder that he wanted to mount the white cockade lads are always wantingto run their heads into danger</s>  you have had your share of it as yousay still you are wise to keep the lad out of it</s>  i dont hold withsoldiering or fighting in quarrels that dont concern you</s> malcolm and ronald travelled through cumberland and westmoreland callingupon many of the gentlemen to whom the latter had been charged to deliverprince charless messages</s>  they could not however flatter themselvesthat their mission was a success for from few of those on whom theycalled did they receive assurances that they were prepared to takeaction all the gentlemen professed affection for the stuarts butdeprecated a descent into england unless the prince were accompanied by astrong body of french troops</s> the rising of 15 had been disastrous for the jacobites of the north ofengland and though all declared that they were ready again to take uparms and risk all for the cause of the stuarts if the prince was at thehead of a force which rendered success probable they were unanimously ofopinion that it would be nothing short of madness to rise until at anyrate the prince had marched into england at the head of a strong army</s> the principal personage upon whom they called was mr</s>  ratcliff a brotherof the earl of derwentwater who had been executed after the rising of15</s>  that gentleman assured them that he himself was ready to join theprince as soon as he came south but that he wished the prince to knowthat in his opinion no large number of english would join</s> the memory of  15 is still too fresh he said while the stuarts havebeen absent so long that although there are great numbers who wouldprefer them to the hanoverians i do not believe that men have the causesufficiently at heart to risk life and property for it</s>  many will givetheir good wishes but few will draw their swords</s>  that is what i wishyou to say to prince charles</s>  among gentlemen like myself the feeling ofrespect and loyalty to his fathers house is as strong as ever and weshall join him however desperate in our opinion the chances of successmay be but he will see that the common people will stand aloof andleave the battle to be fought out by the clansmen on our side andgeorges troops on the other</s> some weeks were passed in traversing the country to and fro for thedesired interviews were often only obtained after considerable loss oftime</s>  they could not ride up as two highland drovers to a gentlemanshouse and had to wait their chances of meeting those they wished to seeon the high road or of sending notes requesting an interview couched insuch terms that while they would be understood by those to whom they wereaddressed they would compromise no one if they fell into other hands</s> there was indeed the greatest necessity for caution for the authoritiesin all the towns and villages had received orders from the government tobe on the lookout for emissaries from the north and they were frequentlyexposed to sharp examination and questioning</s>  indeed it was onlymalcolms familiarity with the country and the fact that he had so manyacquaintances ready to testify that he was as he said a scotch droverin the habit for many years of journeying down from the north withcattle that enabled them to escape arrest</s> after much thought they had decided upon a place of concealment for thequill containing ronalds credentials which would they thought defythe strictest scrutiny</s>  a hole had been bored from the back into the heelof ronalds boot deep enough to contain the quill and after this wasinserted in the hiding place the hole was filled up with cobblers waxso that it would need a close examination indeed to discover itsexistence</s>  thus although they were several times closely searched nodocument of a suspicious nature was found upon them</s> their money was the greatest trouble as the mere fact of so large a sumbeing carried by two drovers would in itself have given rise tosuspicions although had they been on their return towards scotland thepossession of such an amount would have been easily explained as theproceeds of the sale of the cattle they had brought down</s>  they hadtherefore left the greater part of it with a butcher in carlisle withwhom malcolm had often had dealings retaining only ten pounds for theirnecessary expenses</s> the day after they reached manchester four constables came to the littleinn where they were stopping and told them that they were to accompanythem before the magistrates</s> i should like to know what offence we are charged with malcolm saidangrily</s>  things have come to a pretty pass indeed when quiet droversare to be hauled before magistrates without rhyme or reason</s> you will hear the charge quickly enough when you are before theirworships the constable said but that is no affair of mine  myorders are simply to take you there</s> well of course we must go malcolm said grumblingly but here we havebeen well nigh twenty years travelling to and fro between england andscotland as my host here can testify without such a thing happeningbefore</s>  i suppose somebody has been robbed on the highway and so yousharp sighted gentlemen clap hands on the first people you come across</s> three magistrates were sitting when ronald and malcolm were brought intothe courthouse</s>  they were first asked the usual questions as to theirnames and business and then one of the magistrates saidyour story is a very plausible one but it happens that i have herebefore me the reports sent in from a score of different places for intimes like these it is needful to know what kinds of persons aretravelling through the country and two men answering to your descriptionare reported to have visited almost every one of these places</s>  it isstated in nearly every report that you are drovers ordinarily engaged inbringing down herds of highland cattle and it is added that in everycase this account was verified by persons who have previously known you</s> all this would seem natural enough but you seem to have journeyed hitherand thither without any fixed object</s>  sometimes you have stopped for twodays at little villages where you could have had no business and inshort you seem for upwards of a month to have been engaged in wanderingto and fro in such a way as is wholly incompatible with the affairs uponwhich you say you were engaged</s> but you will observe sir malcolm said quietly that i have not saidi am engaged upon any affairs whatever</s>  i am not come to england onbusiness but solely to escape from the troubles which have put a stop tomy trade in the highlands and as for fifteen years i was engaged injourneying backwards and forwards and had many friends andacquaintances i came down partly as i have said to avoid being mixedup in the trouble partly to call upon old acquaintances and partly tointroduce to them my nephew who is new to the work and will shortly beengaged in bringing down cattle here</s>  i thought the present was a goodopportunity to show him all the roads and halting places in order that hemight the better carry out the business</s> your story has been well got up one of the magistrates said though idoubt whether there be a single word of truth in it</s>  however you will beat present searched and detained until we get to the bottom of thematter</s>  this is not a time when men can travel to and fro through thecountry without exciting a suspicion that they are engaged upon otherthan lawful business</s>  at present i tell you that in our eyes your conductappears to be extremely suspicious</s> the prisoners were then taken to a cell and searched with the utmostrigour</s>  their clothes were examined with scrupulous care many of theseams being cut open and the linings slit to see if any documents wereconcealed there</s>  their shoes were also carefully examined but the mudhad dried over the opening where the quill was concealed and theofficials failed to discover it</s>  even their sticks were carefullyexamined to see if they contained any hollow place but at lastconvinced that had they been the bearers of any documents these must havebeen discovered the officials permitted them to resume their clothesand then paying no heed to the angry complaints of malcolm at the stateto which the garments had been reduced they left the prisoners tothemselves</s> be careful what you say malcolm whispered to ronald</s>  many of theseplaces have cracks or peepholes so that the prisoners can be watched andtheir conversation overheard</s> having said this malcolm indulged in a long and violent tirade on thehardship of peaceful men being arrested and maltreated in this way andat the gross stupidity of magistrates in taking an honest drover known tohalf the countryside for a jacobite spy</s>  ronald replied in similarstrains and any listeners there might have been would certainly havegained nothing from the conversation they overheard</s> i should not be surprised malcolm said in low tones when night hadcome and all was quiet if some of our friends outside try to help us</s> the news will speedily spread that two men of the appearance of drovershave been taken on suspicion of being emissaries from scotland and itwill cause no little uneasiness among all those on whom we have called</s> they cannot tell whether any papers have been found upon us nor what wemay reveal to save ourselves so they will have a strong interest ingetting us free if possible</s> if we do get free malcolm the sooner we return to scotland the better</s> we have seen almost all those whom we are charged to call upon and weare certainly in a position to assure the prince that he need hope for norising in his favour here before he comes and that it is very doubtfulthat any numbers will join him if he marches south</s> the next morning they were removed from the cell in which they had beenplaced to the city jail and on the following day were again broughtbefore the magistrates</s> you say that you have been calling on people who know you one of themagistrates began and as i told you the other day we know that you havebeen wandering about the country in a strange way i now requite that youshall tell us the names of all the persons with whom you have hadcommunication</s> the question was addressed to malcolm as the oldest of the prisoners</s> ronald looked round the court which was crowded with people and thoughtthat in several places he could detect an expression of anxiety ratherthan curiosity</s> it will be a long story malcolm said in a drawling voice and i wouldnot say for sure but that i may forget one or two seeing that i havespoken with so many</s>  we came across the hills and the first person wespoke to was master fenwick who keeps the collie dog at appleswade</s>  idont know whether your worship knows the village</s>  i greeted him asusual and asked him how the wife and children had been faring since isaw him last</s>  he said they were doing brawly save that the eldest boyhad twisted his ankle sorely among the fells</s> we dont want to hear all this nonsense the magistrate said angrily</s> we want a list of persons not what you said to them</s> it will be a hard task malcolm said simply but i will do the best ican your worship and i can do no more</s>  let me think there was josephrepton and nat somner  at least i think it was nat but i wont be sureto his christian name  and john dykes and a chap they called pitmanbut i dont know his right name</s> who were all these people</s>  the magistrate asked</s> joe repton he is a wheelwright by trade and nat somner he keeps thevillage shop</s>  i think the others are both labouring men</s>  anyhow they wereall sitting at the tap of the collie dog when i went in</s> but what have we to do with these fellows</s>  the magistrate exclaimedangrily</s> i dont know no more than a child malcolm said but your worshipordered me to tell you just the names of the persons i met and i amdoing so to the best of my ability</s> take care prisoner the magistrate said sternly you are triflingwith the court</s>  you know what i want you to tell me</s>  you have been tothese villages and he read out some fifteen names</s>  what did you gothere for and whom did you see</s> that is just what i was trying to tell your worship in regular orderbut directly i begin you stop me</s>  i have been going through this districtfor fifteen years and i am known in pretty well every village incumberland westmoreland and lancashire</s>  having been away for threeyears and my trade being stopped by the war as your worship well knowsi have been going round having a crack with the people i know</s>  such aswere butchers i promised some fine animals next time i came south suchas were innkeepers i stayed a night with and talked of old times</s>  if yourworship will have patience with me i can tell you all the names and whati said to each of them and what they said to me and all about it</s> i dont want to know about these things</s>  i am asking you whether youhave not been calling on some of the gentry</s> indeed now malcolm said with an air of astonishment and this is thefirst time that i have heard a word about the gentry since i came intothe court</s>  well let me think now i did meet squire ringwood and hestopped his horse and said to me is that you malcolm anderson yourascal and i said its me sure enough squire and he said yourascal that last score of beasts i bought of you silence</s>  shouted the magistrate as a titter ran through the court</s>  allthis fooling will do you no good i can tell you</s>  we believe that you area traitor to the king and an emissary of the pretender</s>  if you make aclean breast of it and tell me the names of those with whom you havebeen having dealings there may be a hope of mercy for you but if notwe shall get at the truth other ways and then your meanness of conditionwill not save you from punishment</s> your worship must do as you like malcolm said doggedly</s>  i have donemy best to answer your questions and you jump down my throat as soon asi open my mouth</s>  what should a man of my condition have to do with kingsor pretenders</s>  they have ruined my trade between them and i care notwhether king george or king james get the best of it so that they do butmake an end of it as soon as possible and let me bring down my herdsagain</s>  theres half a dozen butchers in the town who know me and canspeak for me</s>  i have sold thousands of beasts to master tregold but ifthis is the treatment an honest man meets with i aint likely to sellthem any more for as soon as i am let free and get the money theconstables have taken from me i am off to glasgow and if i ever comesouth of the border again may i be hung and quartered</s> finding that nothing was to be made out of the prisoners the magistrateordered them to be taken back to jail</s> chapter xvi the march to derby</s> two days later when the jailer brought in breakfast to their cell hedropped on the table by the side of the loaf a tiny ball of paper andthen without a word went out and locked the back door</s>  malcolm put hisfinger to his lips as ronald was about to utter an exclamation of joy</s> ones appetite is not as good here as it was when we were tramping thehills ronald but one looks forward to ones meals they form a break inthe time</s> so saying he took up one of the lumps of bread and began to earsecuring at the same time the pellet of paper</s>  we cant be too carefulhe said in a whisper</s>  it is quite possible that they may be able tooverhear us</s> i dont see how ronald replied in the same tone i see no crack orcrevice through which sound could pass</s> you may not see one malcolm said but it may exist for all that</s>  oneof the boards of the ceiling may be as thin as paper and anyonelistening through could hear every word we say when we speak in ournatural voices</s>  the magistrates evidently believe that they have made avaluable capture and would give anything to prove that their suspicionsare correct</s>  now i will go and stand at that grated opening and look atthis paper if they are watching us they will see nothing then</s> the little piece of paper when unfolded contained but a few words keepup your courage</s>  you have friends without working for you</s>  destroy this</s> malcolm at once again rolled up the pellet put it into his mouth andswallowed it and then whispered to ronald what he had just read</s> i thought he whispered that we should soon get a message of somesort</s>  the news of our arrest will have set the hearts of a score ofpeople quaking and they would do anything now to get us out from thisprison</s>  they have already you see succeeded in bribing our warder</s> at his evening visit the warder passed into ronalds hand a small parceland then as before went out without speaking</s> i am confirmed in the belief that we can be overheard malcolm said</s> had the man not been afraid of listeners he would have spoken to us</s>  nowlet us see what he has brought us this time</s> the parcel contained a small file a saw made of watch spring and a tinyphial of oil</s> so far so good malcolm said quietly</s>  our way through these bars isclear enough now</s>  but that is only the beginning of our difficulties</s> this window looks into the prison yard and there is a drop of some fortyfeet to begin with</s>  however i have no doubt our friends will send us themeans of overcoming these difficulties in due course</s>  all we have toconcern ourselves about now is the sawing through of these bars</s> as soon as it was dark they began the work relieving each other inturns</s>  the oil prevented much sound being made but to deaden it stillfurther they wrapped a handkerchief over the file</s>  the bars had been buta short time in position and the iron was new and strong</s>  it wasconsequently some hours before they completed their work</s>  when they haddone the grating was left in the position it before occupied the cutsbeing concealed from any but close observation by kneading up smallpieces of bread and pressing them into them and then rubbing the edgeswith iron filings</s> that will do for tonight malcolm said</s>  no one is likely to pay us avisit but if they did they would not notice the bars unless they wentup and shook them</s>  tomorrow morning we can put a finishing touch to thework</s> as soon as it was daylight they were upon their feet</s> it does very well as it is malcolm said examining the grating</s>  it isgood enough to pass and we need not trouble further about it</s>  nowcollect every grain of those iron filings</s>  no dont do that on anyaccount he broke in as ronald was preparing to blow some of it fromthe lower stonework through the opening</s>  were you to do that it wouldbe quite possible that one of the prisoners walking in the yard might seeit and would as likely as not report the circumstance to one of thewarders in order to curry favour and perhaps obtain a remission of hissentence</s>  scrape it inside and pour every atom down the crevices in thefloor</s>  that done we are safe unless anyone touches the grating</s> they watched their warder attentively when he next came into the cellbut this time he had no message for them</s>  we must not be impatientmalcolm said our friends have a good many arrangements to make forthey will have to provide for our getting away when we are once outbesides they will probably have to bribe other warders and that kind ofthing cant be done in a hurry</s> it was not for another two days that the warder made any fresh sign</s> then as on the first occasion he placed a pellet of paper on the tablewith their bread</s> this is a good deal larger than the last ronald whispered</s> it was not until some little time after they had finished their meal thatronald moved to the grating and unrolled the little ball of paper itcontained only the wordsyou will receive a rope this evening</s>  with this lower yourselves fromyour window into the courtyard</s>  start when you hear the church bellsstrike midnight cross the court and stand against the wall near theright hand corner of the opposite side</s>  the third window on the secondfloor will be opened and a rope lowered to you</s>  attach yourselves tothis and you will be pulled up from above</s> after reading the note ronald passed it on to malcolm who as beforeswallowed it but had this time to tear it into several pieces beforedoing so</s>  the warder was later bringing their supper than usual thatevening and it was dark when he came in</s>  as he entered the room he letthe lamp fall which he carried</s> confound the thing</s>  he said roughly</s>  here take hold of this breadand let me feel for the lamp</s>  i cant be bothered with going down to getanother light</s>  you can eat your supper in the dark just as well i haveno doubt</s> as he handed ronald the bread he also pushed into his hand the end of therope and while he pretended to search for the lamp he turned round andround rapidly and so unwound the rope which was twisted many timesround his body</s>  as soon as this was done he picked up the lamp and witha rough goodnight left them</s> it is just as i suspected malcolm said in ronalds ear</s>  there is apeephole somewhere otherwise there could be no occasion for him to havedropped the lamp</s>  it is well that we have always been on our guard</s> they ate their bread in silence and then after a short talk on thestupidity of the english in taking two drovers for messengers of princecharles they lay down on their rough pallets to pass with what patiencethey could the long hours before midnight for it was late in octoberand it was little after five oclock when the warder visited them</s>  theyfelt but slight anxiety as to the success of the enterprise for they hadno doubt that every detail had been carefully arranged by their friendswithout although certainly it seemed a strange method of escape thatafter lowering themselves from a third floor window they shouldafterwards be hauled up into a second</s>  at last after what seemed almostan endless watch they heard the church clocks strike twelve andsimultaneously rose to their feet</s>  not a word was spoken for although itwas improbable in the extreme that any watcher would be listening at thathour of the night it was well to take every precaution</s>  the grating waslifted out and laid down on one of the couches so that all noise shouldbe avoided</s>  the rope was then strongly fastened to the stump of one ofthe iron bars</s> now malcolm i will give you a leg up i am younger and more activethan you are so you had better go first</s> without debating the question malcolm put his foot on ronalds hand andin a moment was seated in the opening of the window</s>  grasping the rope helet himself quietly out and lowered himself to the ground reaching itso noiselessly that ronald who was listening did nor hear a sound</s> after waiting a minute however he sprang up on to the sill and feelingthat the rope was slack was soon by malcolms side below</s>  then bothremoved their shoes and hung them round their necks and walkingnoiselessly across the court they took up their post under the windowindicated in the note</s>  in less than a minute the end of a rope wasdropped upon their heads</s> you go first this time ronald malcolm said and fastened it beneathronalds arms</s>  then he gave a pull at the rope to show that they wereready</s>  the rope tightened and ronald found himself swinging in the air</s> he kept himself from scraping against the walls by his hands and feetand was especially careful as he passed the window on the first floor</s>  ina minute he was pulled into the room on the second floor by the men whohad hoisted him up</s>  a low hush</s>  warned him that there was still anecessity for silence</s>  the rope was lowered again and ronald lent hisaid to hoist malcolm up to the window</s>  as soon as he was in it was asslowly and carefully closed</s> you are mighty heavy both of you a voice whispered</s>  i should nothave thought it would have been such hard work to lift a man up thisheight</s>  now follow us and be sure you make no noise</s> two flights of stairs were descended and then they stood before a smallbut heavy door some bolts were drawn and a key turned in the lock thisbeing done so noiselessly that ronald was sure they must have beencarefully oiled</s>  the two men passed through with them locking the doorbehind them</s> thank god we are out</s>  malcolm said fervently</s>  i have been in a watchhouse more than once in my young days but i cant say i like it betteras i grow older</s>  they walked for some minutes and then their guidesopened a door and they entered a small house</s> stir up those peats jack one of the men said and blow them a bitwhile i feel for a candle</s> in a minute or two a light was obtained</s> thats very neatly done i think gentlemen laughed the man addressedas jack and who they now saw was the warder who had attended upon them</s> we had rare trouble in hitting upon that plan</s>  the cell you were inopened upon a corridor the doors to which are always locked by the chiefconstable himself and even if we could have got at his key and openedone of them we should have been no nearer escape for two of the warderssleep in the lodge and there would be no getting out without wakingthem and they could not be got at</s>  they are both of them married menwith families and that sort of man does not care about running risksunless he happens to be tired of his wife and wanting a change</s>  nat hereand i have no incumbrances and werent sorry of a chance to shift</s> anyhow there was no way as far as we could see of passing you outthrough that part of the prison and at last the idea struck us ofgetting you out the way we did</s>  that wing of the jail is only used fordebtors and they are nothing like so strict on that side as they are onthe other</s>  some of the warders sleep there so there was no difficulty ingetting hold of the key for an hour and having a duplicate made</s>  tillyesterday all the cells were full and we had to wait till a man whosetime was just up moved out</s>  after that it was clear sailing</s> well we are immensely obliged to you ronald said</s> oh you neednt be obliged to us the warder replied we are well paidfor the job and have a promise of good berths if prince charles gets thebest of it</s>  anyhow we shall both make for london where we haveacquaintances</s>  now we are going to dress up theres no time to be losttalking</s>  there is a light cart waiting for us and horses for you half amile outside the town</s> he opened a cupboard and took our two long smock frocks which he and hiscompanion put on</s> now gentlemen will you put on these two suits of soldiers clothes</s>  ithink they will about fit you</s> ronald and malcolm were soon attired as dragoons</s> theres a regiment of them here the man said so there was nodifficulty in buying a cast off suit and getting these made from it</s>  asto the helmets i guess there will be a stir about them in the morning</s> we got hold of a soldier today and told him we wanted a couple of helmetsfor a lark and he said for a bottle of brandy he would drop them out ofa barrack window at ten oclock tonight and he kept his word</s>  two ofthem will be surprised in the morning when they find that their helmetshave disappeared as to the swords and belts i dont know that they arequite right they were bought at an old shop and i believe they areyeomanry swords but i expect they are neat enough</s>  i was to give youthis letter to take with you it is as you see directed to general wadeat newcastle and purports to come from the colonel of your regimenthere so that if by any chance you are questioned on the way that willserve as a reason for your journeying north</s>  here is a purse of twentyguineas i think thats about all</s> but are we not to see those who have done us such service ronaldasked in order that we may thank them in person</s> i dont know who it is any more than the man in the moon the warderreplied</s>  it was a woman dressed as a serving wench though i doubt itwas only a disguise who came to me</s>  she met me in the street and askedme if i should like to earn fifty pounds</s>  i said i had no objection andthen after a good deal of beating about the bush it came out that whatwas wanted was that i should aid in your escape</s>  i didnt see my way toworking it alone and i told her so</s>  she said she was authorized to offerthe same sum to another so i said i would talk it over with nat</s>  heagreed to stand in and between us we thought about the arrangements buti never got to know any more about her</s>  it was nothing to me whom themoney came from as long as it was all right</s>  we have had half down andare to have the other half when we get to the cart with you</s>  and now ifyou are ready we will be starting</s>  the further we get away from herebefore morning the better</s> they made their way quietly along the streets</s>  the town was in totaldarkness and they did not meet a single person abroad and in a quarterof an hour they were in the open country</s>  another ten minutes and theycame upon the cart and horses</s>  three men were standing beside them andthe impatient stamp of a horses hoof showed that the horses were tied upclosely</s>  a lantern was held up as the party came up</s> all safe</s> all safe ronald replied</s>  thanks many thanks to you for our freedom</s> the man holding the lantern was masked so they could not see his face</s> he first turned to the two warders and placed a bag of money in theirhand</s> you have done your work well he said the cart will take you thirtymiles on your road and then drop you</s>  i wish you a safe journey</s>  you hadbest hide your money in your boots unless you wish it to fall into thehands of highwaymen</s>  the london road is infested with them</s> with a word of farewell to ronald and malcolm the two warders climbedinto the cart one of them mounted beside them and took the reins and inanother minute the cart drove away in the darkness</s>  as soon as it hadstarted the man with the lantern removed his mask</s> mr</s>  ratcliff</s>  ronald exclaimed in surprise</s> yes it is myself</s>  there are half a dozen of us engaged in the matter</s> as soon as we heard of your arrest we determined to get you out</s>  i wasonly afraid you would have been taken up to london before we could getall our plans arranged for i knew they had sent up for instructions</s>  itwas well that we were ready to act tonight for orders were received thisafternoon that you should be sent up under an escort tomorrow</s>  youpuzzled them rarely at your examination and they could make nothing ofyou</s>  our greatest fear was that you might betray yourselves in the prisonwhen you fancied you were alone for we learned from the men who havejust left us that you were placed in a special cell where all that yousaid could be overheard and your movements to some extent watchedthrough a tiny hole in the wall communicating with the cell next to it</s> it widens out on that side so that a man can get his ear or his eye tothe hole which is high up upon the wall and but a quarter of an inchacross so that it could scarcely be observed unless by one who knew ofits existence</s>  the warder said that they could hear plainly enoughthrough this hole but could see very little</s>  however they do not seemto have gathered much that way</s> we were on guard sir my friend malcolm thought it possible that theremight be some such contrivance</s> and now my young friend mr</s>  ratcliff said you had best mount atonce follow this road for half a mile and then take the broad road tothe left you cannot mistake it</s>  it goes straight to penrith</s>  you havegot the letter to general wade</s> yes sir and the money we are indeed in every way greatly indebted toyou</s> say nothing about it mr</s>  ratcliff said</s>  i am risking my life as wellas my fortune in the cause of prince charles and this money is on hisservice</s>  i hear he is already on the march south</s>  repeat to him when youjoin him what i have already told you namely that i and other gentlemenwill assuredly join him but that i am convinced there will be no generalrising in his favour unless a french army arrive to his assistance</s>  thedelay which has taken place has in my opinion entirely destroyed hischances unless he receives foreign assistance</s>  wade has ten thousand menat newcastle the duke of cumberland has gathered eight thousand in themidlands and there is a third army forming to cover london</s>  already manyof the best regiments have returned from holland and each day adds totheir number</s>  do all you can to dissuade him from advancing until frenchaid arrives but tell him also that if he comes with but half a dozenfollowers charles ratcliff will join him and share his fate whatever itbe</s> with a hearty shake of the hand he leapt on his horse and followed byhis servant galloped off in one direction while ronald and malcolm setout in the other</s> this is a grand disguise ronald said</s>  we might ride straight intowades camp at newcastle without being suspected</s> i have no doubt we could malcolm agreed</s>  still it will be wiser tokeep away from the neighbourhood of any english troops</s>  awkward questionsmight be asked and although the letter you have for the general may dovery well to impress any officers of militia or newly raised troops wemay meet on the road and would certainly pass us as two orderliesconveying despatches it would be just as well not to have to appearbefore the general himself</s>  our swords and belts would probably benoticed at once by any cavalry officers</s>  i know nothing about the englisharmy and do not know how much the yeomanry swords and belts may differfrom those of the line</s>  however it is certain the less observation weattract from the soldiers the better but as to civilians we can ridestraight on through towns and villages with light hearts</s> we may as well breathe our horses a bit malcolm now there is nooccasion for haste and we can jog along at our own pace</s>  there is noprobability of pursuit for when they find that we and the warders aremissing and see the rope from our window they will be sure that we shallhave started early and are far away by the time they find out we aregone</s>
accordingly they travelled quietly north boldly riding through smalltowns and villages putting up at little inns and chatting freely withthe villagers who came in to talk over the news for the north was allexcitement</s>  orders had been issued for all the militia to turn out butthere was little response for although few had any desire to risk theirlives in the cause of the stuarts fewer still had any intention offighting for the hanoverians</s> when they arrived within a few miles of newcastle they left the main roadand struck across country their object being to come down upon the roadrunning north from carlisle for they thought it likely that parties ofgeneral wades troops would be scattered far over the country north ofnewcastle</s>  at a farm house they succeeded in buying some civilianclothes giving out that they were deserters and as they were willing topay well the farmer who had no goodwill towards the hanoverians had nodifficulty in parting with two of his best suits</s> they were now in a country perfectly well known to malcolm andtravelling by byways across the hills they crossed the cheviots a fewmiles south of carter fell and then rode down the wild valleys tocastletown and thence to canobie of the esk</s>  as they entered the littletown they found the wildest excitement prevailing</s>  an officer with twoorderlies had just ridden in to say that quarters were to be prepared forprince charles and a quantity of bullocks and meal got in readiness forthe use of the army which would arrive late that evening</s>  ronald soonfound the officer who had brought the order and recognized him as one oflord perths aides de camp</s>  he did not know ronald in his present dressbut greeted him heartily as soon as he discovered who he was</s> how is it the troops are coming this way</s>  ronald asked</s> they are marching through liddesdale from kelso</s>  we halted there for twodays and orders were sent forward to wooler to prepare quarters</s>  thiswas to throw wade off the scent and induce him to march north fromnewcastle to oppose us on that road while as you see we have turnedwest and shall cross into cumberland and make a dash at carlisle</s> a few hours later the prince arrived with his army and as soon as heentered the quarters prepared for him ronald proceeded there and made hisreport</s> i could wish it had been better captain leslie the prince said butthe die is cast now and i cannot think that our friends in the northwho proved so loyal to our cause in 15 will hang back when we are amongthem</s>  when they see that charles ratcliff and other gentlemen whom youhave visited range themselves under our banner i believe the commonpeople will join us also</s>  now give me a full account of your mission</s> ronald gave the list of the gentry he had visited and described hisarrest and imprisonment in manchester and the manner in which mr</s> ratcliff had contrived his escape</s> you have done all that is possible sir the prince said and at anearly opportunity i will show you i appreciate your services</s> on the next day the 8th of november the corps crossed the border onthe 9th they were joined by another column which had marched fromedinburgh by the western road and the united force marched to carlisleand sat down before it</s>  the walls of the city were old and in badcondition the garrison was ill prepared for a siege</s>  it consisted of acompany of invalids in the castle under the command of colonel durandand a considerable body of cumberland militia</s>  the walls however old asthey were could for some time have resisted the battery of four pounderguns which formed the princes sole artillery</s> the mayor returned no answer to the princes summons and orders wereissued to begin to throw up trench works but scarcely had the operationsbegun when news arrived that marshal wade was marching from newcastle torelieve the city</s>  the siege was at once abandoned and the prince marchedout with the army to brampton and took up a favourable position there togive battle</s>  the news proved incorrect and the duke of perth withseveral regiments were sent back to resume the siege</s> on the 13th the duke began to raise a battery on the east side of thetown but after a few shots had been fired from the walls the courage ofthe besieged failed them</s>  the white flag was hung out and the town andcastle surrendered on the condition that the soldiers and militia mightmarch away leaving their arms and horses behind and engaging not toserve again for a year</s>  on the 17th the prince made a triumphal entryinto the place but was received with but little show of warmth on thepart of the inhabitants</s> a halt was made at carlisle and a council was held to determine upon thenext step to be taken</s>  the news which had been received from scotland wasvery unfavourable</s>  lord strathallan who had been appointed by the princeas commander in chief and directed to raise as many troops as possiblehad collected between two and three thousand men at perth and lord lewisgordon had raised three battalions in aberdeenshire but on the otherhand a considerable force had been collected at inverness for kinggeorge</s>  the towns of glasgow paisley and dumfries had turned out theirmilitia for the house of hanover</s>  the officers of the crown hadreentered edinburgh and two regiments of cavalry had been sent forwardby marshal wade to their support</s> while even scotland was thus wavering it seemed almost madness for thelittle army to advance into england</s>  the greater portion of thehighlanders had from the first objected strongly to leave their countryand upwards of a thousand had deserted and gone home on the march downfrom edinburgh</s>  they had started less than six thousand strong and afterleaving a garrison of two hundred men in carlisle but four thousand fivehundred were available for the advance south while wade with his tenthousand men would be in their rear and two english armies of nearlyequal strength be waiting to receive them</s>  at the council the opinions ofthe leaders were almost unanimous against an advance but upon lordgeorge murray saying that if prince charles decided upon advancing thearmy would follow him he determined upon pressing forward</s> the army began its advance on the 20th of november and halted a day atpenrith upon the news that marshal wade was moving to attack them butthe english general had not made any move and the scotch again pushed onthrough shap kendal and lancaster to preston</s>  during the march princecharles marched with his troops clad in highland garb and with histarget thrown across his shoulder</s>  he seldom stopped for dinner but atehis food as he walked chatting gaily with the highlanders and by hischeerfulness and example kept up their spirits</s>  the strictest disciplinewas enforced and everything required by the troops was paid for</s>  atpreston the prince on his entry was cheered by the mob and a few menenlisted</s> from preston the army marched to wigan and thence to manchester</s>  theroad was thronged with people who expressed the warmest wishes for theprinces success but when asked to enlist they all hung back sayingthey knew nothing about fighting</s>  still the feeling in favour of theprinces cause became stronger as he advanced south and at manchester hewas received with the acclamations of the inhabitants the ringing of thebells and an illumination of the city in the evening</s>  the people mountedwhite cockades and the next day about two hundred men enlisted and wereenrolled under the name of the manchester regiment the command of whichwas given to mr</s>  francis townley a roman catholic belonging to an oldlancashire family who with mr</s>  ratcliff and a few other gentlemen hadjoined the army on the advance</s> the leaders however of the princes army were bitterly disappointed atthe general apathy of the people</s>  lancashire had in 15 been thestronghold of the jacobites and the mere accession of two or threehundred men was evident that nothing like a popular rising was to belooked for and they had but themselves to rely upon in the struggleagainst the whole strength of england</s>  marshal wade was in full marchbehind them</s>  the duke of cumberland lay at lichfield in their front witha force of eight thousand veteran troops while a third army of whichthe royal guards were the nucleus was being formed at finchley</s>  largebodies of militia had been raised in several districts</s>  liverpool haddeclared against them chester was in the hands of the earl ofcholmondeley the bridges of the mersey had been broken downdifficulties and dangers multiplied on all sides</s> prince charles ever sanguine was confident that he should be joined bylarge numbers as he advanced south but his officers were now thoroughlyalarmed and the leaders in a body remonstrated with lord george murrayagainst any further advance</s>  he advised them however to offer nofurther opposition to the princes wishes until they came to derbypromising that unless by that time they were joined by the jacobites inconsiderable numbers he would himself as general propose and insistupon a retreat</s>  ronald utilized the short halt at manchester to obtainnew uniforms for himself and malcolm which he was glad to exchange forthe farmers garb which had been the occasion of a good deal of jokingand mirth among his fellow officers on the downward march</s> on the first of december prince charles at the head of one divisionforded the mersey near stockport where the water was waist deep</s>  theother division with the baggage and artillery crossed lower down atcheadle on a hastily constructed bridge and the two columns joined thatevening at macclesfield</s>  here lord george murray succeeded in misleadingthe duke of cumberland as to his intentions by a dexterous manoeuvre</s> advancing with a portion of his force he dislodged and drove before himthe duke of kingston and a small party of english horse posted atcongleton and pursued them some distance along the road towardsnewcastle under tyne</s> the duke of cumberland supposing that the princes army were on theirmarch either to give him battle or to make their way into wales wherethe jacobite party were extremely strong pushed forward with his mainbody to stone</s>  lord george murray however having gained his objectturned sharp off to the left and after a long march arrived at ashbornewhere the prince with the other division of the army had marcheddirect</s>  the next afternoon they arrived at derby having thus altogetherevaded the duke of cumberland and being nearly three days march nearerlondon than was his army</s> the prince that night was in high spirits at the fact that he was nowwithin a hundred and thirty miles of london and that neither wades norcumberlands forces interposed between him and the capital</s>  but hisdelight was by no means shared by his followers and early next morninghe was waited upon by lord george murray and all the commanders ofbattalions and squadrons and a council being held they laid before theprince their earnest and unanimous opinion that an immediate retreat toscotland was necessary</s> they had marched they said so far on the promise either of an englishrising or a french descent upon england</s>  neither had yet occurred</s>  theirfive thousand fighting men were insufficient to give battle to even oneof the three armies that surrounded them  scarcely adequate indeed totake possession of london were there no army at finchley to protect it</s> even did they gain london how could they hold it against the unitedarmies of wade and cumberland</s>  defeat so far from home would meandestruction and not a man would ever regain scotland</s> in vain the prince replied to their arguments in vain expostulated andeven implored them to yield to his wishes</s>  after several hours of stormydebate the council broke up without having arrived at any decision</s>  theprince at one time thought of calling upon the soldiers to follow himwithout regard to their officers for the highlanders reluctant as theyhad been to march into england were now burning for a fight and werelonging for nothing so much as to meet one or other of the hostile armiesopposed to them</s>  the princes private advisers however sheridan andsecretary murray urged him to yield to the opinion of his officerssince they were sure that the clansmen would never fight well if theyknew that their chiefs were unanimously opposed to their giving battle</s> accordingly the prince heartbroken at the destruction of his hopesagreed to yield to the wishes of his officers and at a council in theevening gave his formal consent to a retreat</s> chapter xvii a baffled plot</s> utterly disheartened and dispirited the army commenced its march north</s> the prince himself was even more disappointed than his soldiers andshowed by his manner how bitterly he resented the decision at which hisofficers had arrived</s>  it had seemed to him that success was within hisgrasp and that he had but to march to london to overthrow the hanoveriandynasty</s>  and it is by no means improbable that his instincts were morecorrect than the calculations of his advisers</s>  the news of his rapidmarch south had sent a thrill through the country and although so farthe number of those who had joined him was exceedingly small at thatmoment numbers of gentlemen in wales and other parts of the country werearming their tenants and preparing to take the field</s> there was no hostile force between himself and london for the force atfinchley was not yet organized and could have offered no effectualopposition</s>  a panic reigned in the metropolis and the king was preparingto take ship and leave the country</s>  had the little army marched forwardthere is small doubt that james would have been proclaimed king inlondon</s>  but it may be doubted whether prince charles could havemaintained the advantage he had gained</s>  two armies both superior to hisown were pressing on his rear and would have arrived in london but afew days after himself and although the londoners might have acceptedhim they would hardly have risen in arms to aid him against cumberlandsarmy</s>  had this halted at a distance the reinforcements which might havejoined the prince would have been more than counterbalanced by theregiments of english and hanoverian troops which the king could have sentover and although the strife might have been lengthened the result wouldin all probability have been the same</s> prince charles had no ability in governing</s>  his notions of the absolutepower of kings were as strong as those of his ancestors and surroundedas he was by hotheaded highlanders he would speedily have causeddiscontent and disgust even among those most favourably inclined byhereditary tradition to the cause of the stuarts</s>  but of all this he wasignorant and in the retreat from derby he saw the destruction of hishopes</s> hitherto he had marched on foot with the highlanders chatting gaily ashe went</s>  now he rode in rear of the column and scarce exchanged a wordwith even his most intimate advisers</s>  the highlanders no longer preservedthe discipline which had characterized their southward march</s>  villageswere plundered and in some cases burned and in retaliation the peasantrykilled or took prisoners stragglers and those left behind</s>  even atmanchester where the reception of the army had been so warm a few daysbefore its passage was opposed by a violent mob and the prince was sooffended at the conduct of the townspeople that he imposed a fine of fivethousand pounds upon the city</s> the next morning the march was continued</s>  the highlanders laid hands onevery horse they could find and so all pressed on at the top of theirspeed for the border</s>  the duke of cumberland who had fallen back in allhaste for the protection of london was close to coventry when he heardthat the scotch had retreated northward</s>  with all his cavalry and athousand foot whom he mounted on horses supplied by the neighbouringgentry he set out in pursuit</s>  at preston he was joined by another bodyof horse sent across the country from the army of marshal wade but itwas not until he entered westmoreland that he came up with the rear guardof the insurgents which was commanded by lord george murray</s> defeating some local volunteers who molested him lord george learnedfrom the prisoners that the duke with four thousand men was close athand and he sent on the news to the prince who despatched tworegiments the stuarts of appin and the macphersons of cluny toreinforce him</s>  it was nearly dark when by the light of the moon lordgeorge saw the english infantry who had now dismounted advancing</s>  he atonce charged them at the head of the macphersons and stuarts and in afew minutes the english were completely defeated their commandercolonel honeywood being left severely wounded on the field with ahundred killed or disabled men while the loss of the scotch was buttwelve</s> it was with great difficulty that the highlanders could be recalled fromthe pursuit and lord george himself sent an urgent message to the princebegging for a further reinforcement in order that he might maintain hisground and defeat the whole force of the duke</s>  as usual his wishes weredisregarded and he was ordered to fall back and join the main body atpenrith</s>  the check however was so effective that the duke made nofurther attempt to harass the retreat of the highlanders</s> passing through carlisle some men of a lowland regiment and coloneltwonley with his regiment raised at manchester were left there as agarrison so that the road should be kept open for another and as theprince hoped not far distant invasion</s>  the step was however a cruelone for the duke of cumberland at once laid siege to the place battereda breach in its ancient wall and the garrison were forced to surrender</s> many of them were afterwards executed and imprisoned and ruin fell uponall</s> charles with his army marched north to glasgow where they remained eightdays requisitioning supplies from the town</s>  during their stay ronald andmalcolm put up at the house of andrew anderson</s> what think you of the chances now malcolm</s>  andrew asked his brotherafter hearing what had taken place since he had last seen him</s> i think no better and no worse of it than i did before brother</s>  theyhave had more success than i looked for</s>  i did not think they would everhave got as far south as derby</s>  who would have thought that a fewthousand highlanders could have marched half through england</s>  but i seeno prospect of success</s>  the prince is badly advised</s>  he has but onereally good soldier with him and he is set against him by the intriguesand spite of secretary murray and his friends and partly it may be bylord georges own frankness of speech</s>  he has at his back but half thehighlands for the other portion stand aloof from him</s>  in the lowlands hehas found scarce an adherent and but a handful in england</s>  thehighlanders are brave but it is surely beyond human expectation thatfive or six thousand highlanders can vanquish a kingdom with a brave andwell trained army with abundant artillery</s>  ronald and i mean to fight itout to the end but i do not think the end will be very far off</s> i am sorry for the young prince andrew said</s>  he is a fine fellowcertainly  handsome and brave and courteous and assuredly clement</s>  forthree times his life has been attempted and each time he has releasedthose who did it without punishment</s>  i could not but think as i saw himride down the street today that it was sad that so fine a young manshould be doomed either to the block or to a lifelong imprisonment andthat for fighting for what he has been doubtless taught to consider hisright</s>  there are many here who are bitter against him but i am not oneof them and i am sorry for him sorry for all these brave gentlemen andclansmen for i fear that there will be a terrible vengeance for all thathas been done</s>  they have frightened the english king and his ministerstoo sorely to be ever forgiven and we shall have sad times in scotlandwhen this is all over</s> two evenings later ronald noticed that andrew who had been absent forsome time and had only returned just in time for supper looked worriedand abstracted and replied almost at random to any questions put to him</s> it is of no use he said suddenly when his wife had left the room afterthe conclusion of the meal</s>  i am a loyal subject of king george and iwish him every success in battle and am confident that he will crush outthis rebellion without difficulty but i cannot go as far as some</s>  icannot stand by and see murder done on a poor lad who whatever hisfaults is merciful and generous to his enemies</s>  malcolm i will tell youall i know only bidding you keep secret as to how you got the news forit would cost me my life were it known that the matter had leaked outthrough me</s> this evening five of the council knowing that i am a staunch kingsman took me aside after the meeting was over and told me that there wasa plan on foot to put an end to all the trouble by the carrying off orslaying of prince charles</s>  i was about to protest against it when i sawthat by so doing i should in the first place do no good in thesecond be looked upon as a jacobite and in the third be unable tolearn the details of what they were proposing</s>  so i said that doubtlessit was a good thing to lay by the heels the author of all these troublesand that the life of one man was as nought in the balance compared to theprosperity of the whole country</s>  whereupon they revealed to me theirplan asking me for a subscription of a hundred pounds to carry it outand saying truly that i should get back the money and great honour fromthe king when he learned i had done him such service</s>  after somebargaining i agreed for fifty pounds</s> but what is the plot andrew</s>  malcolm said anxiously</s> it is just this</s>  the prince as you know goes about with scantattendance and though there are guards in front of his house there arebut two or three beside himself who sleep there</s>  there is a back entranceto which no attention is paid and it will be easy for those who know thehouse to enter by that door to make their way silently to his chamberand either to kill or carry him off</s>  i threw my voice in against killingpointing out that the king would rather have him alive than dead so thathe might be tried and executed in due form</s>  this was also their opinionfor they had already hired a vessel which is lying in the stream</s>  theplan is to seize and gag him and tie his arms</s>  there will be nodifficulty in getting him along through the streets</s>  there are few folksabroad after ten oclock and should they meet anyone he will concludethat it is but a drunken highlander being carried home</s>  you see malcolmthere is not only honour to be gained from the king but the thirtythousand pounds offered for the princes person</s>  i pretended to fall inwith the plan and gave them the fifty pounds which they lacked for thehire of the vessel the captain refusing to let them have it save formoney paid down</s>  now malcolm i have told you and ronald all i knowabout the matter and it is for you to see how a stop may be put to it</s> the scoundrels</s>  malcolm said</s>  their loyalty to the king is but a veilto hide their covetousness for the reward</s>  when is it to take place

theymight have all the honour i would be content with my share of the rewardoffered</s>  two of them with four of the guards will enter the house andcarry off the prince</s>  the rest will wait outside and follow closely onthe way down to the port ready to give aid if the others should meet withany obstruction</s>  the whole will embark and sail to london with him</s> and when is this plot to be carried out</s>  malcolm asked</s> tomorrow at midnight</s>  tide will be high half an hour later they willdrop down the river as soon as it turns and will be well out to sea bythe morning</s>  and now i have told you all i will only ask you to act sothat as little trouble as possible may arise</s>  do not bring my name intothe matter if you can avoid doing so but in any case i would rather

andrew said</s>  and i will off to bed orjanet will wonder what i am talking about so long</s>  i will leave you twoto settle how you can best manage the affair which you can do without myhelp for matters of this kind are far more in your way than in mine</s> this is a villainous business ronald malcolm said when they werealone and yet i am not surprised</s>  thirty thousand pounds would nottempt a highlander who has naught in the world save the plaid in which hestands up but these money grubbing citizens of glasgow would sell theirsouls for gain</s>  and now what do you think had best be done in the matterso that the plot may be put a stop to and that without suspicion fallingupon andrew</s>  it would be easy to have a dozen men hiding in the yardbehind the house and cut down the fellows as they enter</s> i do not think that would do malcolm it would cause a tumult and thefact could not be hidden</s>  and besides you know what these highlandersare they already loathe and despise the citizens of glasgow and didthey know that there had been a plot on foot to capture and slay theprince nothing could prevent their laying the town in ashes</s> that is true enough</s>  what do you propose then ronald</s> i think it best that if there should be any fighting it should be onboard the ship but possibly we may avoid even that</s>  i should say thatwith eight or ten men we can easily seize the vessel and then when theboat comes alongside capture the fellows as they step on to the deckwithout trouble and leave it to the prince to settle what is to be donewith them</s> that is certainly the best plan ronald</s>  i will get together tomorrowhalf a dozen trusty lads who will ask no questions as to what i want themto do and will be silent about the matter afterwards</s>  we must get fromandrew tomorrow morning the name of the vessel and see where she islying in the stream and where the boat will be waiting for the prince</s> the next night ronald and malcolm with six men made their way one by onethrough the streets so as not to attract the attention of the watch andassembled near the strand</s>  not until the clock struck twelve did theyapproach the stairs at the foot of which the boat was lying</s>  there weretwo men in it</s> you are earlier than we expected one said as they descended the steps</s> the captain said a quarter past twelve</s> yes we are a little early malcolm replied as he stepped into theboat we are ready earlier than we expected</s> a moment later malcolm suddenly seized one of the sailors by the throatand dragged him down to the bottom of the boat a handkerchief wasstuffed into his mouth and his hands and feet tied</s>  the other was at thesame time similarly secured</s> so suddenly and unexpected had been the attack that the sailors had hadno time to cry out or to offer any resistance and their capture waseffected without the slightest sound being heard</s>  the oars were at oncegot out and the boat was rowed out towards the vessel lying out in themiddle of the stream with a light burning at her peak</s>  as they approachedthe side the captain appeared at the gangway</s> all is well i hope</s>  he asked</s> could not be better malcolm replied as he seized the rope and mountedthe gangway the others closely following him</s>  as he sprang upon the deckhe presented a pistol at the captains head</s> speak a word and you die he said sternly</s> taken by surprise the captain offered no resistance but sufferedhimself to be bound</s>  two or three sailors on deck were similarly seizedand secured the hatchway was fastened to prevent the rest of the crewfrom coming on deck and the ship being thus in their possession two ofthe men at once took their places in the boat and rowed back to thestairs</s> a quarter of an hour later those on board heard a murmur of voices onshore and two or three minutes later the splash of oars as the boatrowed back to the ship</s>  ronald put on the captains cap and stood at thegangway with a lantern</s> all right i hope</s>  he asked as the boat came alongside</s> all right captain</s>  you can get up your anchor as soon as you like</s> two men mounted on to the deck and then four

confronted by eight armed men</s> the six men of the watch furious at the prospect of losing the rewardupon which they had reckoned drew their swords and rushed forward butthey were struck down with

little part in it save as the recipients of blows formalcolm furious at their treachery had bade the men make no distinctionbetween them and the watch and had himself dealt them one or two heavyblows with his handspike after he had seen that the guard wasoverpowered</s> the whole of them were then bound and warned that their throats would becut if they made the least noise</s>  the prince was released from his bondsand he was at once conducted by malcolm and ronald to the cabin where alight was burning</s> the prince was so much bewildered by the events that had occurred that hedid not yet understand the state of the case</s>  he had</s>  been awoke by a gagbeing roughly forced into his mouth while at the same moment his handswere tightly bound</s>  then he was lifted from his bed some clothes werethrown on to him a man took his place on either side and thrustingtheir arms into his threatened him with instant death if he did not comealong with them without resistance</s>  then he had been hurried down stairsand along the streets two men keeping a little ahead and othersfollowing behind</s>  he had been forced into a boat and rowed up to a shipand on reaching the deck a desperate combat had suddenly commenced allround him</s>  then the gag had been removed and the bonds cut</s>  bewilderedand amazed he gazed at the two men who had accompanied him to the cabin</s> why captain leslie</s>  he exclaimed</s>  is it you</s>  what means all thisscene through which i have passed</s> it means your royal highness ronald said respectfully that i and myfriend malcolm obtained information of a plot on the part of some of thecitizens to carry you off and sell you to the english</s>  we could havestopped it by attacking them as they entered the house to seize you buthad we done so an alarm must have been raised and we feared that thehighlanders when they knew of the treachery that had been attemptedagainst you might have fallen upon the citizens and that a terribleuproar would have taken place</s>  therefore we carried out another plan</s>  wefirst of all obtained possession of the ship in which you were to havebeen taken away and then overcame your captors as they brought you onboard</s>  all this has been done without any alarm having been given and itnow rests with you to determine what shall be done with these wretches</s> you have done well

lowlanders sell king charles to the english</s>  i might have expectedthat some at least would be tempted by the reward offered me</s>  as forpunishment for these men they are beneath me</s>  and moreover if i cantrust my eyes and my ears the knocks which you gave them will bepunishment enough even did i wish to punish them which i do not</s>  i couldnot do so without the story of the attempt being known and in that casethere would be no keeping my highlanders within bounds</s>  as it is they arecontinually reproaching me with what they call my mistaken clemency andthere would be no restraining them did they know of this</s>  no we had bestleave them to themselves</s>  we will order the captain to put to sea withthem at once and tell him he had best not return to glasgow until i haveleft it</s>  they will have time to reflect there at leisure and asdoubtless they have each of them given reasons at home for an absence ofsome duration there will be no anxiety respecting them</s>  and nowgentlemen will you fetch in those who have aided in my rescue</s>  i wouldthank every one of them for the service they have rendered and impressupon them my urgent desire that they should say nothing to anyone of thisnights work</s> while the prince was speaking to the men malcolm went out and havingunbound the captain ordered him to deliver up the sum which he hadreceived for the conveyance of the prince and his captors to england</s> the captain did as he was ordered</s> how much is there here</s>  malcolm asked</s> three hundred pounds</s> malcolm counted out fifty of it and placed them in his pocket saying toronaldthere is no reason andrew should be a loser by the transaction</s>  thatwill leave two hundred and fifty which i will divide among our men whenwe get ashore</s> malcolm then gave the princes orders to the captain that he mustimmediately they left the ship get up his anchor as before intended andmake out to sea and that under pain of being tried and executed for hisshare in this treacherous business he was not to return to glasgow withhis eleven passengers for the space of a week</s> the prince and his rescuers then entered the boats and rowed to shoreand the prince regained his apartment without anyone in the house beingaware that he had been absent from it</s>  the next day the prince sent forronald and malcolm and in a private interview again expressed to themhis gratitude for his rescue from the hands of his enemies</s> i have none but empty honour to bestow now he said but believe meif i ever mount the throne of england you shall see that charles edwardstuart is not ungrateful</s> the incident was kept a close secret only two or three of the princesmost intimate advisers ever informed of it</s>  these were unanimous inurging that an absolute silence should be maintained on the subject forthe fact that the attempt would have certainly been crowned with successhad it not been for the measures ronald had taken might

enemy but these did not repeat their tactics atfalkirk</s>  disgusted at the conduct of the prince in slighting their adviceand listening only to his unworthy counsellors lord george murray withall

thatanother battle could not be fought with a chance of success andtherefore recommended that the army should at once retire to thehighlands where a sufficient number of men could be kept together

no lad if we get over thisscrape i have done with fighting and i hope that no stuart will everagain succeed in getting scotland to take up his cause</s>  i shall go onfighting for prince charles as

village when he returned</s> the enemy are in the village he said</s>  i can see clouds of smokerising in that direction</s>  we had better be off at once</s>  they will bescouring all the hills here as they have done elsewhere and we hadbetter get out of the neighbourhood</s> there was no packing to be done and taking with them what remained ofthe food malcolm had last brought they started on their way</s>  they madefirst for the spring from which they had drawn their water and thenfollowed the little stream on its way down the hill as it flowed in theopposite direction to the village</s>  an hours walking took them into theforest</s> before we go further let us have a consultation malcolm said</s>  we aresafe now from pursuit and had better settle upon what course we intendto adopt</s>  shall we make for glasgow and lie hid there until things blowover a little or make for the isles and stay there until we get achance of being taken off by some french ship</s>  that is what they say theprince has done and indeed as there would be no chance of his getting aship on the east coast and all the lowlands are against them he iscertain to have made for the isles</s>  the clanranalds and most of the otherislemen are loyal to him and would receive and shelter him</s>  skye ishostile but elsewhere he will be safe and would move from island toisland or get across to the mainland by night if the pursuit became toohot</s>  what do you say ronald</s> i would not try glasgow unless as a last resource malcolm you areknown to many there and as i was there as one of the princes officerson two occasions i might easily be recognized</s>  you may be sure that thereis a very strict lookout for fugitives and every stranger who enters atown will be closely examined</s>  after some time when prince charles andthe principal chiefs and the leaders will either have escaped across thewater or been hunted down things will calm down but at present we mustnot try to pass through the lowlands</s> at any rate we cannot try to do so till your shoulder is completelyhealed and you can use your arm naturally but i do not think that wehad better try and cross to the isles just at present</s>  if prince charlesis there or is believed by the english to be there the search will beso keen that every stranger would be hunted down and although thehighlanders might risk imprisonment and death for the prince himselfthey could not be expected to run the same risk for anyone else</s>  if theprince escapes it will be because the whole population are with him andevery man woman and child is trying to throw the pursuers off thescent</s>  no i think we should be safer in edinburgh itself than in theisles</s>  we will make a shift to live as we can for a month or so by thattime i hope you will be able to use one arm as well as the other and wewill then boldly go down into the lowlands in our old characters as twodrovers</s> that will be the best plan no doubt ronald agreed the difficultywill be the getting over the next month</s> we shall manage that malcolm said fortunately you have still gotsome money left</s> yes i have over fifty pounds it was lucky i was able to draw it as wereturned north from the man i left it with at carlisle</s> yes and you wanted to give it back to the treasury malcolm said andwould have done it if i had not almost quarrelled with you about itsaying that it had been given you for a certain purpose that you hadcarried out that purpose and had therefore a right to it and that youwould be only looked upon as a fool if you offered to pay it back</s> however there it is now and lucky it is you have got it</s>  however hardthe times however great the danger a man will hardly starve in scotlandwith fifty pounds in his pocket so now we will turn our faces west andmake for the head of one of the lochs there are plenty of fish to be hadfor catching and with them and a little oatmeal and a bottle or two ofwhiskey we can live like lords</s> they walked for some hours and stopped for the night in the hut of ashepherd who received them hospitably but could give them but littlefood his scanty supplies being almost exhausted for as he told themthe hills are full of fugitives and those who come all cry for meal asfor meat there is no want of it</s>  men wont starve as long as there aresheep and cattle to be had for lifting them and at present there aremore of these than usual in the hills for they have all been driven upfrom the villages lest they should fall into the hands of the troopersbut meal is scarce for men dare not go down to the villages to buy andwe only get it when the women bring it up as they have a chance</s> in the morning the shepherd gave them directions as to the way theyshould take and a few hours later they came down upon the head of one ofthe many deep inlets on the western coast</s>  a small fishing boat stood onthe shore but they dared not descend into this but made their way tothe point where as the shepherd had told them a stream which flowedfrom a mountain tarn some miles inland made its way down into the sea</s> the banks were thickly wooded for some two miles from its outlet beyondthat was a moorland covered with heather</s>  they determined to encamp nearthe upper edge of the wood and at once set to with their swords to cutdown branches and construct a hut</s>  this was completed before dusk andmalcolm then started for the village on the seashore</s>  ronald besought himto be most careful</s> there is likely he said to be a party of soldiers in every villageround the coast for they will know that all the chiefs and officerswould be making for the sea</s>  the clansmen have only to remain in thehills until this persecution dies out and then go quietly home againbut for the leaders the only hope is escape by sea</s> i will be careful lad malcolm said</s>  i shall not enter the villagebut will hang about in its outskirts until i come across someone andwith plenty of money in my pocket it is hard if i cannot manage to get abag of meal and a net even if the place is full of english soldiers</s> three hours later malcolm returned laden with a sack containing fortypounds of meal a jar with two gallons of whiskey and a net</s> there he said as he entered we can do for a month now if needs be</s> there is a party of militia in the village and i hear the whole coast isclosely watched and there are a number of english cruisers among theislands</s> how did you get the things</s> i waited till a woman came down with a bundle of faggots and told herwhat i wanted</s>  she said at first it was impossible but when i said i wasprepared to pay well she altered her tone and said she would send herhusband out to me</s>  he soon came and after some bargaining he agreed tobring me out the things i wanted for three pounds and here they are</s>  isee you have got a fire alight so we will make some cakes at once</s>  ihave brought a griddle and two horns with me</s> the next morning they set to work to fish</s>  the net was stretched acrossthe lower end of a pool and they then stripped and waded in splashingand throwing stones as they went</s>  it was just up to their necks in thedeepest parts shallowing to two feet below</s>  when they reached the netthey found two fine salmon caught there and carrying these ashore theysplit one and placed it above the fire</s>  the net was then removed and inhalf an hour they were sitting down to a breakfast of grilled salmon andhot oatmeal cakes which ronald thought the most delicious repast he hadever tasted</s> for three weeks they remained at this spot</s>  they were not always alonebeing sometimes joined for a day or two by other fugitives who likethemselves were wandering near the sea coast seeking escape</s>  theseseldom stayed long for it was felt unsafe to keep in parties of morethan two or three at the utmost</s>  some of the fugitives were in wretchedcondition having been wandering among the moors and forests for weeksand as the fishing was very successful ronald and malcolm were able togive them at parting a good supply of smoked salmon and a portion ofmeal of which malcolm from time to time brought a fresh supply up fromthe village</s> the people there knew little of what was passing in the outer world butfrom the conversation of the soldiers they were sure that prince charleshad so far escaped capture and an opinion began to prevail that he hadsucceeded in making his escape by sea in spite of the vigilance of theenglish cruisers</s> by the end of the three weeks even malcolm admitted that ronalds woundwas completely cured</s>  two large blue scars showed where the bullet hadpassed through and beneath this could be felt a lump where the brokenbone had knitted together and this would in time become as strong as therest of the shoulder</s>  malcolms splints had done their duty and the eyecould detect no difference between the level or width of the twoshoulders</s>  ronald could move his arm freely in all directions andexcept that he could not at present venture to put any strain upon thearm he might be considered as perfectly cured</s>  they determinedtherefore to continue their way</s>  in the first place however it wasnecessary to procure other clothes for ronald was still in uniform andalthough malcolms attire was not wholly military it yet differedmaterially from that of a countryman</s> we shall have to get other clothes when we get south malcolm saidfor a highlanders dress would be looked upon with as much suspicion inglasgow as would that uniform of yours</s>  but until we get down to thelowlands the native garb will be the best</s> accordingly he paid another visit to the village and with the utmostdifficulty persuaded the man he had before dealt with to bring him twosuits of clothes such as were worn by the fishermen there</s>  in thesealthough malcolms small stock of gaelic would betray them at once forother than they seemed to the first clansman who might address them theycould pass muster with any body of english troops they might meet by theway</s> before starting they caught and smoked as many salmon as they couldcarry as the fishermen of the coast were in the habit of exchanging fishfor sheep with their inland neighbours</s>  they cut each a short pole andslung some fish at each end and then placing it on their shoulderstarted on their way</s>  they kept along the hillside until they struck thetrack  for it could scarcely be called a road  leading from thevillage into the interior and then boldly followed this for thedifficulty of travelling across the hilly and broken country was so greatthat they preferred to run the slight extra risk of keeping to the roadfeeling certain that for the first days march at least their appearanceand the fish they carried would answer for themselves with any body oftroops they might meet</s> of this however they did not think there was much chance</s>  theauthorities would have long since learned the futility of hunting thefugitives among the hills and would be confining their efforts to thesea coast</s>  they were now at a considerable distance from the scene of thebloody persecutions of cumberland and hawley and although in other partsof scotland severe measures might be adopted against known adherents ofthe stuarts it was among the highland clans only that savage andwholesale massacres were being carried into effect</s> occasionally in the course of the days walk they met with clansmenpassing along the road</s>  these generally passed with a brief word ofgreeting in gaelic</s>  one or two who stopped to speak recognized at once bymalcolms accent that the wayfarers were not what they pretended to bebut they asked no questions and with a significant smile and anexpression of good wishes went on their way</s> at the village where they stopped after a long days journey the sameline of conduct was observed towards them</s>  the inhabitants guessed atonce that they were in disguise but the edicts against those whoassisted fugitive insurgents were so severe that none made any open signof their recognition</s>  they paid for their nights lodging and food with aportion of their fish which they were indeed glad to get rid of</s> the next day they resumed their journey and towards sunset arrived at avillage where they saw a party of english cavalry who had apparently butjust arrived</s>  the men were cleaning their horses and an officer wassitting on a bench in front of the principal house in the village for hehad already made a close inspection of every house in the village andthe angry faces of the women and the sullen looks of a few men there wereabout showed how they resented the disturbance of their households</s> it was too late to retreat and malcolm and ronald walked boldly to thepublic house in the centre of the village</s>  the officer at once rose andwalked across to him</s> who are you</s>  he asked and where do you come from</s> malcolm shook his head and said in gaelici do not understand english</s> what fools these people are</s>  the officer exclaimed</s>  ho within there</s> the landlady came to the door</s> do you speak english</s> i speak a little the woman said</s> just ask these men who they are and where they come from</s> the woman asked the question in gaelic and malcolm repliedwe are as you see fishermen and we come from huish</s> as he spoke there was a slight change in the womans face but it passedaway and she translated malcolms answer to the officer</s> but that is forty miles away the officer said</s>  what do they do withtheir fish at this distance from their home</s> the question being put in gaelic by the woman malcolm replied that owingto the boats being seized by the soldiers and trade being at astandstill they could no longer make a living at home and weretherefore on their way to glasgow to ship as sailors</s>  they were carryingtheir fish with them to pay for their food and lodging on the way</s> the story was probable enough and the officers suspicion was allayed</s> they are fine looking fellows both of them he said to himself as hereturned to his bench</s>  father and son i suppose</s>  the young one wouldmake a strapping soldier</s>  like enough he was at culloden</s>  however thankgoodness i have no grounds for suspecting or detaining them</s>  i am sickof this brutal business of fugitive hunting</s>  we are officers and notbutchers and this slaying of brave men who have met us fairly in battleis a disgrace to the british name</s> ronald and malcolm followed the woman into the house</s> i am ready to buy some of your fish she said in a loud tone of voicein gaelic for there will be many to feed this evening as my house isfull of soldiers i cannot take you in but if you like you can sleep inthat shed over there</s>  i can cook one of your fish for you and let youhave some black bread but that is all i can do</s>  now how much do youwant for the fish</s> malcolm named a low price and the woman took three or four of thelargest</s>  for these she offered him the price he had asked</s>  he glancedround and seeing that they were not overlooked he shook his head</s> we dont want money he said</s>  we are well provided</s>  many thanks forkeeping our secret</s> the woman nodded and without another word the two went out and sat downon a stone bench outside until the landlady brought out a platter with afish and some black bread</s>  this they ate where they sat</s>  malcolm thenwent in to get some tobacco and returned with his pipe alight and satwith ronald watching with apparent interest the operations of thesoldiers until night closed in</s>  then they retired to the shed thelandlady had pointed out and found that a large bundle of freshlygathered rushes had been shaken out to form a bed</s>  carrying in theirpoles with their now diminished load of fish they closed the door andthrew themselves down upon the rushes</s> that has passed off well malcolm said</s>  tomorrow we will only go amile or so out of the village and stop in the first wood we come to andgo on at night</s>  thirty miles will take us close down to dumbarton andthere we must manage to get some fresh clothes</s> we shall be able to leave our poles behind us ronald said and thatwill be a comfort</s>  although my load of fish was not nearly as heavy asyours still carrying it on one shoulder was no joke and i shall beheartily glad to get rid of it</s> i shall not be sorry myself malcolm said but there will be nooccasion to waste the fish</s>  we shall be up and away long before thesoldiers are stirring and we may as well hand them over as a present tothe landlady</s> this was done and at an early hour in the morning they were upon theroad again</s>  after an hours walking they stopped in a wood till eveningand then continued on their way until they reached dumbarton where theythrew themselves down beside some boats drawn up upon the shore andslept till the morning</s> they then boldly entered the town and as their garb was similar to thatof the men who brought down the fish caught at the villages on the coastno attention whatever was paid to them</s>  they had no difficulty inpurchasing the clothes they required and carrying them out of the townthey changed in the first retired spot they reached and as two lowlanddrovers tramped on to glasgow</s>  with their bonnets pulled well down overtheir eyes they entered the town</s>  they had little fear of discovery fornone would be likely to recognize in ronald the gaily dressed youngofficer of prince charles</s> as to malcolm he felt safe from molestation</s>  he was of course known tomany drovers and others but they would not concern themselves with whathe had been doing since they last saw him and even had they noticed himwhen he was there with ronald would not denounce an old comrade</s>  hewent therefore boldly to the little inn where he had been in the habitof staying when in the city</s> ah malcolm is that you man</s>  the landlord said as he entered</s>  ididna think o seeing you again</s>  i thought it likely ye were laying stiffand stark somewhere out on the muirs</s>  eh man you are a foolish fellowto be mixing yourself up in the affairs of ithers</s> i have done with it now jock for good and all malcolm said and amgoing back to my old trade again</s> i think you are a fule to come back here so soon</s>  theres mony a onemarked ye as ye rode in behind that young officer of the princes and ifthey denounce you now they would soon clap you in between four walls</s> hoots man</s>  malcolm laughed who would trouble themselves about a bodylike me</s> there are bleudy doings up i the highlands the landlord said gravelyif a they say is true</s> it is true jock more shame to them but they wouldnt do in glasgowwhat they are doing there</s>  they are hunting down the clansmen like wildbeasts but here in the lowlands they will not trouble themselves to askwho was for king george and who was against him except among those whohave got estates they can confiscate</s> may be no the landlord replied</s>  still malcolm if you will take myadvice you wont show yourself much in the streets nor your friendeither he added significantly</s>  you may be safe but the citizens aresmarting yet over the requisitions that were made upon them and yourfriend had best keep in his room as long as ye stay here</s> malcolm nodded</s> he will be careful jock never fear</s>  we shall be off again as soon aswe get a chance</s>  i will leave him here while i go down the town and findwhether there is a herd starting for england</s>  if there is we will go withit if not i shall try and get a passage by sea</s> malcolm could not hear of any drove of cattle going south</s>  the troubleshad for the time entirely put a stop to the trade</s>  after it was dark hewent to andrews</s>  his brothers face expressed both pleasure and dismayat seeing him</s> right glad i am to see you have got safely through it all malcolm butyou must be mad to show yourself here again at present</s>  but how is theboy</s>  we have troubled sorely over him</s>  i trust that he too has comesafely through it</s> safe and sound andrew save that he had a bullet through his shoulderat culloden but he is tight enough again now</s> and what have you been doing ever since</s> curing his shoulder and fishing malcolm briefly related theiradventures since culloden</s> and is he with you here in glasgow malcolm</s>  surely you are not madenough to bring him here where he is known to scores of people as one ofthe rebel officers</s> he is here sure enough malcolm said and safer than he has been forsome time</s>  it is nearly two months since culloden and people arebeginning to think of other things except in the highlands where thosefiends cumberland and hawley are burning and slaying</s>  ronald is dressedlike a drover and no one is likely to recognize him</s>  however he willremain within doors</s>  and now brother i want you to take us a passage inthe next vessel sailing for london</s>  if i go to a shipper he may askquestions and like enough it may be necessary to get passes signedbefore we can go on board</s> certainly it is andrew said</s>  a strict lookout is kept to prevent therebel leaders from escaping and no captain of a ship is permitted totake a passenger unless he is provided with a pass signed by amagistrate saying that he is a peaceable and well known person</s> but just at present we are both peaceable persons andrew and we cancertainly claim to be well known citizens</s> it is no joking matter malcolm i can tell you andrew said irritablybut of course i will see what i can do</s>  and now i will put on my bonnetand come with you and have a chat with ronald</s>  it will not do to bringhim here tonight but we must arrange for him to come and see janetbefore he sails</s>  i shall not tell her anything about it till he is readyto start for you know she is very particular and i am afraid i shallhave to say what is not quite true to get the order</s>  i can sign itmyself but it must have the signature of the provost too</s> so saying he took his cap and accompanied malcolm to the lodging</s> stay here a moment andrew malcolm said when he arrived within a fewyards of the little inn</s>  i will see that there is no one drinkingwithin</s>  it wouldna look well to see a decent bailie of the city goinginto a liquor shop after dark</s>  it will be best for me to fetch him outhere for i doubt theres any room where you could talk without fear ofbeing overheard</s> ronald who was sitting with his cap pulled down over his eyes as ifasleep in a corner of the room where three or four drovers were smokingand talking was called out by malcolm</s> i am right glad to see you again andrew anderson said heartily</s>  janetand i have passed an ill time since the battle was fought</s>  elspeth haskept up our hopes all along</s>  she said she was sure that you were alivequite downright sure and though neither janet nor i have much faith insuperstitions the old womans assertions that she should assuredly knowit if you were dead did somehow keep up our spirits</s>  besides i had faithin malcolms knowledge of the country and knew you were both famous forgetting into scrapes and out of them so i thought that if neither bulletnor sabre had stretched you on the moor of culloden you would manage towin your way out of the trouble somehow</s>  however i think you are prettysafe here</s>  the bloody doings of cumberland have shocked every scotchmanand even those who were strongest against the stuarts now cry shame andso strong is the feeling that were the prince to appear now with ahandful of followers i believe the whole country would rise in hisfavour</s>  so deep is the wrath and grief at the red slaughter among thehighlands there would not be many scotchmen found who would betray afellow scot into the hands of these butchers</s>  i will make inquirytomorrow as to what ships are sailing and will get you a passage in thefirst</s>  there may be some difficulty about the permit but if i cant getover it we must smuggle you on board as sailors</s>  however i dont thinkthe provost will ask me any questions when i lay the permit before himfor his signature</s>  he is heart and soul for the king but like us allhe is sick at heart at the news from the north and would i think shutan eye if he saw a jacobite making his escape</s>  and now lad i must begoing back for the hour is getting late and janet does not know why i amaway</s>  come to us tomorrow evening as soon as the shop closes</s>  janet andelspeth will be delighted to see you and we will have a long talk overall that you have gone through</s> on the following evening ronald and malcolm presented themselves atandrews and were received with delight by elspeth and mrs</s>  anderson</s>  thelatter had while the rebellion appeared to have a chance of successbeen its bitter opponent and had spoken often and wrathfully against herhusbands brother and ronald embarking in such an enterprise but withits overthrow all her enmity had expired and she would have been readyto give assistance not only to them but to any other fugitive trying toescape</s> i have good news for you andrew said when the first greetings wereover</s>  a vessel sails in the morning and i have taken passages for youin it and what is more have brought your permits</s>  i went to the provostand said to him provost i want you to sign these permits for twofriends of mine who are wanting to go up to london</s> who are they</s>  said he</s> they are just two drover bodies i said</s>  he looked at me hard</s> one question andrew</s>  i know how you feel just at present</s>  you are aloyal man like myself but we all feel the same</s>  i will sign your permitfor any save one</s>  give me your word that neither of these men is charlesstuart</s>  i care not who they may be beside but as a loyal subject of kinggeorge i cannot aid his arch enemy to escape</s> i give you my word provost i said</s>  one is i dont want to know who they are he interrupted</s>  i had rather notknow</s>  it is enough for me that you give me your word that neither of themis charles stuart and he took the pen and signed the permit</s>  betweenourselves he went on i shall be glad to hear that the misguided youngman is safe across the water but as provost of glasgow i could lend himno help to go</s> they say he has got safe away already i said</s> i think not andrew the coast has been too closely watched for that</s> the young man is hiding somewhere among the isles among the clanranaldsor macdonalds</s>  i fear they will have him yet</s>  i dread every day to getthe news but i hope beyond all things that if they do lay hands on himit will be through the treachery of no scot</s> i hope not provost i said</s>  they havent got over throwing it in ourteeth that we sold king charles to cromwell</s>  so we just shook hands andsaid goodbye and here is the permit</s> they spent a long evening talking over the past</s> i wonder if i shall ever see you again ronald</s>  mrs</s>  anderson saidwith tears in her eyes as they rose to say goodbye</s> you need nor fear about that janet woman her husband said</s>  ronaldand malcolm aye fall on their legs and we shall see them back again liketwo bad pennies</s>  besides he went on more seriously there will be anend of these savage doings in the north before long</s>  loyal men inscotland are crying out everywhere against them and the feeling inengland will be just as strong when the truth is known there and youwill see that before long there will be a general pardon granted to allexcept the leaders</s>  fortunately ronald and malcolm are not likely to bein the list of exceptions and before a year is up they will be able tocome back if they will without fear of being tapped on the shoulder by akings officer</s> i shall come back again if i can you may be sure ronald said</s>  ofcourse i do not know yet what my father and mothers plans may be butfor myself i shall always look upon scotland as my home and come back toit as soon as i have an opportunity</s> you do not intend to stay in the french army</s> certainly not</s>  after the treatment my father has received i have noinclination to serve france</s>  the chief reason why scotchmen have enteredher service has been that they were driven from home and that theylooked to france for aid to place the stuarts on the throne again</s>  nowthat the time has come france has done nothing to aid and has seen thestuart cause go down without striking a blow to assist it</s>  i considerthat cause is lost for ever and shall never again draw my sword againstthe house of hanover</s>  nor have i had any reason for loving france</s>  afterliving in a free country like scotland who could wish to live in acountry where one mans will is all powerful  where the people arestill no better than serfs  where the nobles treat the law as made onlyfor them  where as in my fathers case a man may not even marryaccording to his own will without incurring the risk of a lifesimprisonment</s>  no i have had enough of france and if ever i get theopportunity i shall return to scotland to live</s>
the next morning early ronald and malcolm embarked on board a ship</s>  theirpermits were closely scrutinized before the vessel started and athorough search was made before she was allowed to sail</s>  when theofficers were satisfied that no fugitives were concealed on board theyreturned to shore and the vessel started on her voyage for london</s> chapter xx happy days</s> on arriving in london after ten days voyage ronald and malcolmobtained garments of the ordinary cut</s>  the one attired himself as anenglish gentleman the other in a garb suitable to a confidentialattendant or steward and after a stay of two or three days they madetheir way by coach down to southampton</s> here they remained for a week and then effected a bargain with thecaptain of a fishing lugger to set them on shore in france</s>  as the twocountries were at war this could only be done by landing them at night atsome quiet spot on the french coast</s>  the lugger cruised about a couple ofdays and then choosing a quiet night when there was a mist on thewater she ran in as closely as she dared then the boat was lowered andmalcolm and ronald were rowed to shore and landed a few miles south ofboulogne</s> when it was light they made their way to a village here but fewquestions were asked them for many refugees from scotland and englandwere crossing to france</s>  as they had been well provided with funds byandrew they posted to paris and on arriving there put up at the innwhere they had stopped on the occasion of their first visit</s> we must be careful malcolm said how we stir out until we know howthings stand</s>  the first thing to do is to find out whether the regimentis still in paris</s> this they were not long in doing as their host was able to inform themat once that it had left the capital several months before and oncomparing dates they found that its departure had followed within a dayor two that of their own flight from paris</s> it was no doubt meant as a punishment ronald said on colonel humefor acting as my second in that affair with the duke</s>  i hope that nofurther ill befell him</s> his mind was set easy on this score by the news that colonel hume hadaccompanied his regiment</s>  on asking after marshal saxe they learned thathe was away on the frontier where he had been carrying on the war withgreat success antwerp mons namur and charleroi all having beencaptured</s> the king was in person with the army</s>  this being the case ronald saw thatit was of no use remaining in paris as he was without friend orprotector there and he dared not rejoin his regiment until he learnedwhether the kings anger was as hot as ever</s>  he therefore started at oncewith malcolm and travelled down to la grenouille</s> it was a joyful meeting between him and his parents who were in thegreatest anxiety respecting him for although he had written severaltimes communication was uncertain owing to the war the only chance ofsending letters being by such french vessels as arrived at scottish portsafter running the gauntlet with english cruisers</s>  some of these had beencaptured on the way back and only two of ronalds letters had arrivedsafely</s>  the last of these had been written a few days after the battle offalkirk and ronald had then stated that he no longer had any hope of thefinal success of the expedition</s>  they had received the news of the defeatat culloden and had since passed nearly three months of painfulsuspense relieved only by the arrival of ronald himself</s>  he found hismother looking well and happy his father had somewhat recovered from hisrheumatism and looked a younger man by some years than when he saw himlast</s> he will recover fast now the countess said but he has worried aboutyou night and day ronald</s>  i hope that you will stay with us for a time</s> we have seen so little of you yet</s> ronald learned that a few days after his flight an officer had appearedat the chateau with the royal order for his arrest and it was from himthat his parents had first learned the news of his duel with the duke ofchateaurouge and its result</s> i could hardly believe my ears ronald his father said to think thatmy son scarce a man yet should have killed in fair fight one of thefirst duellists in france</s>  it seemed almost incredible</s>  malcolm told methat you were a first rate swordsman but this seemed extraordinaryindeed</s>  the officer remained here for three days and then convincedthat you had not made in this direction left us</s>  a day or two afterwardswe received the letter you wrote us from nantes saying that you werestarting for scotland with the prince</s>  i grumbled sorely over myrheumatism i can tell you which prevented my drawing my sword once morefor the stuarts but it was no use my thinking of it</s> no indeed the countess said and i can tell you ronald that had hebeen ever so well i should not have let him go</s>  after being separatedfrom ones husband for sixteen years one is not going to let him run offto figure as a knight errant at his pleasure</s> your friend colonel hume wrote to us the colonel said with a smile athis wifes word giving us details of the duel and speaking of yourconduct in the highest terms</s>  he said that at present the king wasfurious but that he hoped in time he would get over it</s>  colonel hume hadseen marshal saxe who had promised on the first opportunity to speak tothe king and to open his eyes to the character of his late favouriteand to tell him of the attempts which the duke had made to prevent theroyal orders for our release being carried out and to remove you byassassination</s>  two months ago he wrote again to us from antwerp whichhad just fallen saying that marshal saxe had bid him tell us that theking was in a much more favourable disposition and that he had taken theopportunity when his majesty was in a good humour to tell him the wholecircumstances of your journey with the orders for our release and thatin consequence the king had made other inquiries respecting the lateduke and had acknowledged that he had been greatly deceived as to hischaracter</s>  at the same time as your name had been by the kings orderremoved from the list of officers of the scottish dragoons immediatelyafter the duel he recommended that should you return to france youshould not put yourself in the kings way or appear at all in public forthe present</s> the marshal colonel hume wrote has made your affair a personalmatter and he as is his habit in war will persevere until he succeeds</s> his reputation and influence are higher than ever and are daily risingbe assured that when the campaign is over and he reaps all the honoursto which he is entitled he will push your claim as before</s> in the first week in october

night he made his way to that place and embarked on the20th of september attended by locheil colonel roy stuart and about ahundred other fugitives who had learned of the arrival of the frenchvessels</s>  it was almost precisely the spot at which he had disembarkedfourteen months before</s>  a fog concealed the vessel as she passed throughthe british fleet lying to intercept her and they reached roscoff aftera nine days voyage</s> such was the tale which prince charles told to ronald</s>  he had afterculloden entirely recovered his high spirits and had borne all hisfatigues and hardships with the greatest cheerfulness and good humourmaking light of hunger fatigue and danger</s>  ronald only remained twodays in paris and then returned home</s> in october the campaign of flanders ended with the complete defeat ofprince charles of lorraine at rancaux and marshal saxe returned toparis where he was received with enthusiasm by the population</s>  the royalresidence of chambord was granted him for life and he was proclaimedmarshal general of the kings armies</s>  a fortnight later colonel lesliereceived a letter from him saying that he had received his majestyscommand that he with the countess and his son should present themselvesin paris and that he was happy to say that the kings disposition wasmost favourable</s>  they set off at once</s>  on their arrival there they calledupon marshal saxe who greeted the colonel as an old friend and refusedto listen to the warm expression of gratitude of leslie and the countess</s> say nothing about it madam he exclaimed</s>  your son won my heart andi was only too glad to be of service to him and my old comrade here</s>  whatis the use of a man winning victories if he cannot lend a helping hand tohis friends</s> the next day they went down to versailles where marshal saxe presentedthem to the king in a private audience</s>  louis received them graciously</s> i fear countess that you and your husband have been treated with someharshness but our royal ear was deceived by one in whom we hadconfidence</s>  your husband and yourself were wrong in marrying without theconsent and against the will of your father and such marriages cannot bepermitted but at the request of marshal saxe who has done so much forfrance that i cannot refuse anything he asks i have now consented topardon and overlook the past and have ordered my chancellor to preparean order reinstating you in all the possessions and estates of thecountess your mother</s>  i hope that i shall often see you together withyour husband and son both of whom have done good service as soldiers offrance at my court and now that i see you he said with a gracioussmile i cannot but feel how great a loss our court has suffered by yourlong absence from it</s> upon leaving the kings private chamber and entering the great audiencehall colonel hume came up and grasped the hand of his old friend and wasintroduced by him to his wife while many of the courtiers who wereeither connections or friends of the family of the countess alsogathered round them for the news that she was restored to royal favourhad spread quickly</s>  the countess knew how small was the real value ofsuch advances but she felt that it was best for her husband and sonssake to receive them amicably</s>  for a few weeks they remained in paristaking part in the brilliant fetes which celebrated the success of thefrench arms and they then retired to the handsome chateau which was nowthe property of the countess</s> here they lived quietly for two years making occasional visits to paris</s> at the end of that time ronald received a letter from andrew anderson towhom he had written several times since his return to france</s>  he told himthat he had just heard that glenlyon and the rest of the property whichhad been confiscated after the rising of 1715 was for sale</s>  it had beenbestowed upon a neighbouring chief who had been active in the hanoveriancause</s>  he was now dead without leaving issue and his wife an englishlady was anxious to dispose of the property and return to england</s> i do not know whether your father is disposed to buy back his estatesandrew wrote but i hear that a general amnesty will very shortly beissued to all who took part in the insurrection saving only certainnotorious persons</s>  the public are sick of bloodshed</s>  there have beenupwards of eighty trials and executions besides the hundreds who wereslaughtered in the highlands</s>  besides this thousands have beentransported</s>  but public opinion is now so strong and persons of allshades of politics are so disgusted with the brutal ferocity which hasbeen shown that it is certain government will ere long be compelled topass an act of amnesty</s>  in the meantime if it should be your fatherswish to purchase the property i can buy it in my name</s>  the priced askedis very low</s>  the income arising from it is stated to be about fourhundred a year and four thousand pounds will be accepted for it</s>  iunderstand that as the late owner took no part in the insurrection andjoined the duke of cumberland when he came north the property is in goodcondition and the clansmen have escaped the harrying which befell allthose who sided with charles stuart</s> ronald at once laid the letter before his father who after reading itthrough passed it without a word to the countess</s> you would like to return to scotland</s>  she asked quietly when she readit</s>  do not hesitate to tell me dear if you would</s>  it is no matter tome whether we live there or here so long as i have you and ronald withme</s> colonel leslie was silent</s> for ronalds sake she went on perhaps it would be better so</s>  you areboth of opinion that the cause of the stuarts is lost for ever and he isdetermined that he will never again take part in any rising</s>  he does notcare again to enter the french army nor indeed is there any reason whyscotchmen should do so now that they no longer look for the aid of theking of france to set the stuarts on the english throne</s>  i myself have noties here</s>  my fifteen years of seclusion have separated me altogetherfrom my family and although they are willing enough to be civil now icannot forget that all those years they did nothing towards procuring ourliberty</s>  the king has so far given way that he has restored me mymothers estates but it was only because he could not refuse marshalsaxe and he does not like french lands to be held by strangerstherefore i feel sure that were i to ask his permission to sell myestates and to retire with you to scotland he would at once grant myrequest</s> no amelie it would not be fair to accept your generous offer</s> but it would be no sacrifice she urged</s>  i have little reason to lovefrance and i can assure you i should be just as happy in your country asin my own</s> but it would be exile the colonel said</s> no more exile than you and ronald are suffering here</s>  besides i supposewe should get as many comforts in scotland as here in france</s>  of courseour estates here will fetch a sum many times larger than that which wouldpurchase glenlyon and we need not live all our time among the mountainsyou tell me of but can go sometimes to edinburgh or even to london</s>  evenif you did not wish it i should say it would be far better to do so forronalds sake</s>  you have lived so long in france that you may have becomea frenchman but it is not so with ronald</s> it was not until two or three days later that the discussion came to anend and the countess had her way</s>  colonel leslie had resisted stoutlybut his heart beat at the thought of returning to the home of his youthand ending his days among the clansmen who had followed him and hisfathers before him</s>  ronald had taken no part whatever in the debate buthis mother read in his eyes the delight which the thought of returning toscotland occasioned him</s>  as soon as this was settled they went to parisand as the countess had foreseen the king was pleased at once to givehis consent to her disposing of her lands on his approval of thepurchaser</s> no difficulty was experienced on this score as a noble whose landsadjoined her own offered at once to purchase them</s>  as soon as this wasarranged instructions were sent to andrew to purchase not only theglenlyon property but the other estates of its late owner</s> in due time a letter was received from andrew saying that he had arrangedfor the purchase of the whole for the sum of thirteen thousand poundsand the money was at once sent over through a dutch banking house</s>  veryshortly afterwards at the end of 1747 the act of general amnesty waspassed and as ronalds name was not among those excluded from itsbenefits they at once prepared to return to scotland</s>  the journey wasfacilitated by the fact that shortly after the passing of the act peacewas concluded between england and france</s> accompanied by malcolm colonel leslie the countess and ronald sailedfor scotland</s>  the colonel and his wife remained in edinburgh while ronaldand malcolm went to glasgow where andrew had in readiness all the paperstransferring the estates purchased in his name to colonel leslie whoshortly afterwards journeyed north with his wife and son and tookpossession of his ancestral home amid the enthusiastic delight of theclansmen who had never ceased to regret the absence of him whom theyconsidered as their rightful chief</s> there is little more to tell</s>  colonel leslie lived but a few years afterreturning home and ronald then succeeded him as leslie of glenlyon</s>  hehad before this married the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman andpassed his time between glenlyon and edinburgh varied by an occasionalvisit to london</s> the countess never regretted her native land but happy in the affectionof her son and daughter in law and their children lived happily withthem until nearly the end of the century</s>  malcolm remained the faithfuland trusty friend of the family and his brother and his wife wereoccasionally persuaded to pay a visit to glenlyon where their kindnessto ronald as a child was never forgotten</s>  happily the rising of 45 wasthe last effort on behalf of the stuarts</s>  scotland accepted the decisionas final and the union between the two countries became close andcomplete</s>  henceforth scotchmen went no longer to fight in the armies offrance but took service in that of their own country and more than oneof ronalds grandsons fought stoutly in spain under wellington</s> </s>
