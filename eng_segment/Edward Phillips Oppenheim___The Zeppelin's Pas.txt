ceased their labours butshe did not look up</s> about mr</s>  hamar lessingham she repeated</s>  rather a limited subject iam afraid</s> i am not so sure he said thoughtfully</s>  for instance who is he</s> i have no idea she replied</s>  does it matter</s>  he was at college withrichard and he has been a visitor at wood norton</s>  that is all thatwe know</s>  surely it is sufficient for us to offer him any reasonablehospitality</s> i am not disputing it sir henry assured her</s>  on the face of it itseems perfectly reasonable that you should be civil to him</s>  on the otherhand there are one or two rather curious points about his coming herejust now</s> really</s>  philippa murmured indifferently bending a little lower overher work</s> in the first place her husband continued how did he arrive here</s> for all i know she replied he may have walked</s> a little unlikely</s>  still he didnt come from london by either of theevening trains and it seems that you didnt take his rooms for himuntil about seven oclock before which time he hadnt been to thehotel</s>  so you see one is driven to wonder how the mischief he did gethere</s> i took his rooms</s>  philippa repeated with a sudden little catch at herheart</s> some one from here rang up didnt they</s>  sir henry went on carelessly</s> i gathered that we were introducing him at the hotel</s> where did you hear that</s>  she demanded</s> he shrugged his shoulders but avoided answering the question</s> i have no doubt he continued that the whole subject of mr</s>  hamarlessingham is scarcely worth discussing</s>  yet he does seem to havearrived here under a little halo of coincidence</s> i am afraid i have scarcely appreciated that philippa remarked infact his coming here has seemed to me the most ordinary thing

looked him in the eyes</s> i am not a child she said scornfully</s> he closed the door after her</s>  for a moment he remained as thoughundecided whether to follow or not</s>  his face had softened with herabsence</s>  finally however he turned away with a little shrug ofthe shoulders threw himself into his easychair and began to smokefuriously</s> the telephone bell disturbed his reflection</s>

signified her desire that her husband should remain a littlebehind with her</s>  they walked side by side up the gravel path</s>  philippakept her hands clasped behind her</s> to leave the subject of

but it was odd how fugitive and transient herthoughts became</s>  her husband was always there in the background butin those moments it was lessingham who was the predominant figure</s>  sheremembered his earnestness his tender solicitude for her the couragewhich when necessity demanded had flamed up in him a born and naturalquality</s>  she remembered the agony of those few minutes on the precedingday when nothing but what still seemed a miracle had saved him</s>  at onemoment she felt herself inclined to pray that he might never come back</s> at another her heart ached to see him once more</s>  she knew so wellthat if he came it would be for her sake that he would come to ask herfinally the question with which she had fenced</s>  she knew too that hiscoming would be the moment of her life</s>  she was so much of a woman andthe passionate craving of her sex to give love for love was there in herheart almost omnipotent</s>  and in the background there was that bitterdesire to bring suffering upon the man who had treated her like a childwho had placed her in a false position with all other women who haddawdled and idled away his days heedless of his duty heedless of everyserious obligation</s>  when she tried to reason her way seemed so clearand yet behind it all there was that cold impulse of almost victorianprudishness the inheritance of a long line of virtuous

had come there to decide and decision came nonearer to her</s>  a late afternoon star shone weakly in the sky</s>  a faintvaporous mist obscured the horizon and floated in tangled wreaths uponthe face

him</s>  have you been riding offyour bad temper</s> he glanced down at his horses quivering sides</s>  back as far as one couldsee there was that regular line of hoof marks</s> am i badtempered</s>  he asked</s> well she observed i dont know you well enough to answer thatquestion</s>  i was simply thinking of yesterday evening</s> he slipped from his horse and stood before her</s>  his long severe facehad seldom seemed more malevolent</s> i had enough to make me badtempered he declared</s>
 i had trackeddown a german spy step by step until i had him there waiting forarrestexpecting it evenand then i got that wicked message</s> what was that wicked message after all</s>
 she enquired</s> that doesnt matter he answered</s>  it was from a quarter where theyought to know better and it ordered me to make no arrest</s>  i have sentto the war office today a full report and

asked</s> if you had told me to he replied looking at her steadfastly</s> philippa felt a little shiver</s>  there was something ominous in theintensity of his gaze and the meaning which he had contrived to impartto his tone</s>  she rose to her feet</s> well she said dont let me keep you here</s>  i am getting cold</s> he passed his arm through the bridle of his horse</s>  i will walk withyou if i may he proposed</s>  she made no reply and they set their faceshomewards</s> i hear lessingham has left the place he remarked a little abruptly</s> oh i expect hell come back philippa replied</s> how long is it lady cranston since you took to consorting with germanspies</s>  he asked</s> dont be foolishor impertinent she enjoined</s>  you are making aridiculous mistake about mr</s>

was never so hard</s>  she repeated</s>  do you imagine that i have everfor a single moment considered my demeanour towards youyou of allpersons in the world</s>  i simply dont remember when you have
