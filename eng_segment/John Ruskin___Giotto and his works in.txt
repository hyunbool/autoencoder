the account given us by vasari of the mode of his competition on thisoccasion is one of the few anecdotes of him which seem to beauthentic especially as having given rise to an italian proverb andit has also great point and value</s>  i translate vasaris wordsliterally</s> this work his paintings in the campo santo of pisa acquired forhim both in the city and externally so much fame that the popebenedict ix</s>  sent a certain one of his courtiers into tuscany to seewhat sort of a man giotto was and what was the quality of his workshe the pope intending to have some paintings executed in st</s> peters which courtier coming to see giotto and hearing that therewere other masters in florence who excelled in painting and in mosaicspoke in siena to many masters then having received drawings fromthem he came to florence and having gone one morning into giottosshop as he was at work explained the popes mind to him and in whatway he wished to avail himself of his powers and finally requestedfrom him a little piece of drawing to send to his holiness</s>  giottowho was most courteous took a leaf of vellum</s>  and upon this witha brush dipped in red fixing his arm to his side to make it as thelimb of a pair of compasses and turning his hand made a circle soperfect in measure and outline that it was a wonder to see whichhaving done he said to the courtier with a smile there is thedrawing</s>  he thinking himself mocked said shall i have no otherdrawing than this</s>  this is enough and too much answered giottosend it with the others you will see if it will be understood</s>  theambassador seeing that he could not get any thing else took hisleave with small satisfaction doubting whether he had not been made ajest of</s>  however when he sent to the pope the other drawings and thenames of those who had made them he sent also that of giottorelating the way in which he had held himself in drawing his circlewithout moving his arm and without compasses</s>  whence the pope andmany intelligent courtiers knew how much giotto overpassed inexcellence all the other painters of his time</s>  afterwards the thingbecoming known the proverb arose from it thou art rounder than theo of giotto which it is still in custom to say to men of the grosserclay for the proverb is pretty not only on account of the accidentof its origin but because it has a double meaning round beingtaken in tuscany to express not only circular form but slowness andgrossness of wit</s> such is the account of vasari which at the first reading might begravely called into question seeing that the paintings at pisa towhich he ascribes the sudden extent of giottos reputation have beenproved to be the work of francesco da volterra5 and sincemoreover vasari has even mistaken the name of the pope and writtenboniface ix</s>  for boniface viii</s>  but the story itself must i think betrue and rightly understood it is singularly interesting</s>  i sayrightly understood for lord lindsay supposes the circle to have beenmechanically drawn by turning the sheet of vellum under the hand asnow constantly done for the sake of speed at schools</s>  but neither dovasaris words bear this construction nor would the drawing so madehave borne the slightest testimony to giottos power</s>  vasari saysdistinctly and turning his hand or as i should rather read itwith a sweep of his hand not turning the vellum neither would acircle produced in so mechanical a manner have borne distinct witnessto any thing except the draughtsmans mechanical ingenuity and giottohad too much common sense and too much courtesy to send the pope adrawing which did not really contain the evidence he required</s>  lordlindsay has been misled also by his own careless translation ofpennello tinto di rosso a brush dipped in red by the wordcrayon</s>  it is easy to draw the mechanical circle with a crayon butby no means easy with a brush</s>  i have not the slightest doubt thatgiotto drew the circle as a painter naturally would draw it that isto say that he set the vellum upright on the wall or panel beforehim and then steadying his arm firmly against his side drew thecircular line with one sweeping but firm revolution of his handholding the brush long</s>  such a feat as this is completely possible toa welldisciplined painters hand but utterly impossible to anyother and the circle so drawn was the most convincing proof giottocould give of his decision of eye and perfectness of practice</s> footnote 5 at least lord lindsay seems to consider the evidencecollected by frster on this subject conclusive</s>  christian art vol</s> ii</s>  p</s>  168</s> still even when thus understood there is much in the anecdote verycurious</s>  here is a painter requested by the head of the church toexecute certain religious paintings and the only qualification forthe task of which he deigns to demonstrate his possession is executiveskill</s>  nothing is said and nothing appears to be thought ofexpression or invention or devotional sentiment</s>  nothing is requiredbut firmness of hand</s>  and here arises the important question didgiotto know that this was all that was looked for by his religiouspatrons</s>  and is there occult satire in the example of his art which hesends them</s> or does the founder of sacred painting mean to tell usthat he holds his own power to consist merely in firmness of handsecured by long practice</s>  i cannot satisfy myself on this point butyet it seems to me that we may safely gather two conclusions from thewords of the master it is enough and more than enough</s>  the firstthat giotto had indeed a profound feeling of the value of precisionin all art and that we may use the full force of his authority topress the truth of which it is so difficult to persuade the hastyworkmen of modern times that the difference between right and wronglies within the breadth of a line and that the most perfect power andgenius are shown by the accuracy which disdains error and thefaithfulness which fears it</s> and the second conclusion is that whatever giottos imaginativepowers might be he was proud to be a good workman and willing tobe considered by others only as such</s>  there might lurk as has beensuggested some satire in the message to the pope and someconsciousness in his own mind of faculties higher than those ofdraughtsmanship</s>  i cannot tell how far these hidden feelings existedbut the more i see of living artists and learn of departed ones themore i am convinced that the highest strength of genius is generallymarked by strange unconsciousness of its own modes of operation andoften by no small scorn of the best results of its exertion</s>  theinferior mind intently watches its own processes and dearly valuesits own produce the mastermind is intent on other things thanitself and cares little for the fruits of a toil which it is apt toundertake rather as a law of life than a means of immortality</s>  it willsing at a feast or retouch an old play or paint a dark wall for itsdaily bread anxious only to be honest in its fulfilment of itspledges or its duty and careless that future ages will rank it amongthe gods</s> i think it unnecessary to repeat here any other of the anecdotescommonly related of giotto as separately taken they are quitevalueless</s>  yet much may be gathered from their general tone</s>  it isremarkable that they are almost without exception records ofgoodhumoured jests involving or illustrating some point of practicalgood sense and by comparing this general colour of the reputation ofgiotto with the actual character of his designs there cannot remainthe smallest doubt that his mind was one of the most healthy kindand active that ever informed a human frame</s>  his love of beauty wasentirely free from weakness his love of truth untinged by severityhis industry constant without impatience his workmanship accuratewithout formalism his temper serene and yet playful his imaginationexhaustless without extravagance and his faith firm withoutsuperstition</s>  i do not know in the annals of art such anotherexample of happy practical unerring and benevolent power</s> i am certain that this is the estimate of his character which must bearrived at by an attentive study of his works and of the few datawhich remain respecting his life but i shall not here endeavour togive proof of its truth because i believe the subject has beenexhaustively treated by rumohr and frster whose essays on the worksand character of giotto will doubtless be translated into english asthe interest of the english public in medival art increases</s>  i shalltherefore here only endeavour briefly to sketch the relation whichgiotto held to the artists who preceded and followed him a relationstill imperfectly understood and then as briefly to indicate thegeneral course of his labours in italy as far as may be necessary forunderstanding the value of the series in the arena chapel</s> the art of europe between the fifth and thirteenth centuries dividesitself essentially into great branches one springing from the othergrafted on the old roman stock</s>  the first is the roman art itselfprolonged in a languid and degraded condition and becoming at last amere formal system centered at the feet of eastern empire and thencegenerally called byzantine</s>  the other is the barbarous and incipientart of the gothic nations more or less coloured by roman or byzantineinfluence and gradually increasing in life and power</s> generally speaking the byzantine art although manifesting itselfonly in perpetual repetitions becoming every day more cold andformal yet preserved reminiscences of design originally noble andtraditions of execution originally perfect</s> generally speaking the gothic art although becoming every day morepowerful presented the most ludicrous experiments of infantileimagination and the most rude efforts of untaught manipulation</s> hence if any superior mind arose in byzantine art it had before itmodels which suggested or recorded a perfection they did notthemselves possess and the superiority of the individual mind wouldprobably be shown in a more sincere and living treatment of thesubjects ordained for repetition by the canons of the schools</s> in the art of the goth the choice of subject was unlimited and thestyle of design so remote from all perfection as not always even topoint out clearly the direction in which advance could be made</s>  thestrongest minds which appear in that art are therefore generallymanifested by redundance of imagination and sudden refinement oftouch whether of pencil or chisel together with unexpected starts ofeffort or flashes of knowledge in accidental directions graduallyforming various national styles</s> of these comparatively independent branches of art the greatest isas far as i know the french sculpture of the thirteenth century</s>  nowords can give any idea of the magnificent redundance of itsimaginative power or of the perpetual beauty of even its smallestincidental designs</s>  but this very richness of sculptural inventionprevented the french from cultivating their powers of painting exceptin illumination of which art they were the acknowledged masters andin glasspainting</s>  their exquisite gift of fretting their stoneworkwith inexhaustible wealth of sculpture prevented their feeling theneed of figuredesign on coloured surfaces</s> the style of architecture prevalent in italy at the same periodpresented on the contrary large blank surfaces which could only berendered interesting by covering them with mosaic or painting</s> the italians were not at the time capable of doing this forthemselves and mosaicists were brought from constantinople whocovered the churches of italy with a sublime monotony of byzantinetraditions</s>  but the gothic blood was burning in the italian veins andthe florentines and pisans could not rest content in the formalism ofthe eastern splendour</s>
 the first innovator was i believe giunta ofpisa the second cimabue the third giotto the last only being a manof power enough to effect a complete revolution in the artisticprinciples of his time</s> he however began like his master cimabue with a perfect respectfor his byzantine models and his paintings for a long time consistedonly of repetitions of the byzantine subjects softened in treatmentenriched in number of figures and enlivened in gesture</s>  afterwards heinvented subjects of his own</s>  the manner and degree of the changeswhich he at first effected could only be properly understood by actualcomparison of his designs with the byzantine originals6 but indefault of the means of such a comparison it may be generally statedthat the innovations of giotto consisted in the introduction a ofgayer or lighter colours b of broader masses and c of morecareful imitation of nature than existed in the works of hispredecessors</s> footnote 6 it might not i think be a work unworthy of the arundelsociety to collect and engrave in outline the complete series ofthese byzantine originals of the subjects of the arena chapel inorder to facilitate this comparison</s>  the greek mss</s>  in the britishmuseum would i think be amply sufficient the harleian ms</s>  numbered1810 alone furnishing a considerable number of subjects andespecially a death of the virgin with the st</s>  john thrown into thepeculiar and violent gesture of grief afterwards adopted by giotto inthe entombment of the arena chapel</s>
a</s>  greater lightness of colour</s>  this was partly in compliance with atendency which was beginning to manifest itself even before giottostime</s>  over the whole of northern europe the colouring of the eleventhand early twelfth centuries had been pale in manuscripts principallycomposed of pale red green and yellow blue being sparinglyintroduced earlier still in the eighth and ninth centuries theletters had often been coloured with black and yellow only</s>  then inthe close of the twelfth and throughout the thirteenth century thegreat system of perfect colour was in use solemn and deep composedstrictly in all its leading masses of the colours revealed by godfrom sinai as the noblestblue purple and scarlet with goldother hues chiefly green with white and black being used in pointsor small masses to relieve the main colours</s>  in the early part ofthe fourteenth century the colours begin to grow paler about 1330 thestyle is already completely modified and at the close of thefourteenth century the colour is quite pale and delicate</s>
i have not carefully examined the colouring of early byzantine workbut it seems always to have been comparatively dark and inmanuscripts is remarkably so giottos paler colouring thereforethough only part of the great european system was rendered notable byits stronger contrast with the byzantine examples</s> b</s>  greater breadth of mass</s>  it had been the habit of the byzantinesto break up their draperies by a large number of minute folds</s>  normanand romanesque sculpture showed much of the same character</s>  giottomelted all these folds into broad masses of colour so that hiscompositions have sometimes almost a titianesque look in thisparticular</s>  this innovation was a healthy one and led to very nobleresults when followed up by succeeding artists but in many ofgiottos compositions the figures become ludicrously cumbrous fromthe exceeding simplicity of the terminal lines and massiveness ofunbroken form</s>  the manner was copied in illuminated manuscripts withgreat disadvantage as it was unfavourable to minute ornamentation</s> the french never adopted it in either branch of art nor did any othernorthern school minute and sharp folds of the robes remainingcharacteristic of northern more especially of flemish and germandesign down to the latest times giving a great superiority to thefrench and flemish illuminated work and causing a proportionateinferiority in their large pictorial efforts</s>  even rubens and vandykecannot free themselves from a certain meanness and minuteness indisposition of drapery</s> c</s>  close imitation of nature</s>  in this one principle lay giottosgreat strength and the entire secret of the revolution he effected</s> it was not by greater learning not by the discovery of new theoriesof art not by greater taste nor by ideal principles of selectionthat he became the head of the progressive schools of italy</s>  it wassimply by being interested in what was going on around him bysubstituting the gestures of living men for conventional attitudesand portraits of living men for conventional faces and incidents ofeveryday life for conventional circumstances that he became greatand the master of the great</s>  giotto was to his contemporariesprecisely what millais is to his contemporariesa daringnaturalist in defiance of tradition idealism and formalism</s>  thegiottesque movement in the fourteenth and preraphaelite movement inthe nineteenth centuries are precisely similar in bearing andmeaning both being the protests of vitality against mortality ofspirit against letter and of truth against tradition and both whichis the more singular literally links in one unbroken chain offeeling for exactly as niccola pisano and giotto were helped by theclassical sculptures discovered in their time the preraphaeliteshave been helped by the works of niccola and giotto at pisa andflorence and thus the fiery cross of truth has been delivered fromspirit to spirit over the dust of intervening generations</s> but what it may be said by the reader is the use of the works ofgiotto to us</s>  they may indeed have been wonderful for their timeand of infinite use in that time but since after giotto cameleonardo and correggio what is the use of going back to the ruderart and republishing it in the year 1854</s>  why should we fretourselves to dig down to the root of the tree when we may at onceenjoy its fruit and foliage</s>  i answer first that in all mattersrelating to human intellect it is a great thing to have hold of theroot that at least we ought to see it and taste it and handle itfor it often happens that the root is wholesome when the leaveshowever fair are useless or poisonous</s>  in nine cases out of ten thefirst expression of an idea is the most valuable the idea mayafterward be polished and softened and made more attractive to thegeneral eye but the first expression of it has a freshness andbrightness like the flash of a native crystal compared to the lustreof glass that has been melted and cut</s>  and in the second place weought to measure the value of art less by its executive than by itsmoral power</s>  giotto was not indeed one of the most accomplishedpainters but he was one of the greatest men who ever lived</s>  he wasthe first master of his time in architecture as well as in paintinghe was the friend of dante and the undisputed interpreter ofreligious truth by means of painting over the whole of italy</s>  theworks of such a man may not be the best to set before children inorder to teach them drawing but they assuredly should be studied withthe greatest care by all who are interested in the history of thehuman mind</s> one point more remains to be noticed respecting him</s>  as far as i amaware he never painted profane subjects</s>  all his important existingworks are exclusively devoted to the illustration of christianity</s> this was not a result of his own peculiar feeling or determination itwas a necessity of the period</s>  giotto appears to have consideredhimself simply as a workman at the command of any employer for anykind of work however humble</s>  in the sixtythird novel of francosacchetti we read that a stranger suddenly entering giottos studythrew down a shield and departed saying paint me my arms on thatshield</s>  giotto looking after him exclaimed who is he</s>  what is he</s> he says paint me my arms as if he was one of the bardi</s>  what armsdoes he bear</s> 7 but at the time of giottos eminence art was neveremployed on a great scale except in the service of religion nor hasit ever been otherwise employed except in declining periods</s>  i do notmean to draw any severe conclusion from this fact but it is a factnevertheless which ought to be very distinctly stated and verycarefully considered</s>  all progressive art hitherto has beenreligious art and commencements of the periods of decline areaccurately marked in illumination by its employment on romancesinstead of psalters and in painting by its employment on mythologyor profane history instead of sacred history</s>  yet perhaps i shouldrather have said on heathen mythology instead of christianmythology for this latter termfirst used i believe by lordlindsayis more applicable to the subjects of the early painters thanthat of sacred history</s>  of all the virtues commonly found in thehigher orders of human mind that of a stern and just respect fortruth seems to be the rarest so that while selfdenial and courageand charity and religious zeal are displayed in their utmost degreesby myriads of saints and heroes it is only once in a century that aman appears whose word may be implicitly trusted and who in therelation of a plain fact will not allow his prejudices or hispleasure to tempt him to some colouring or distortion of it</s>  hence theportions of sacred history which have been the constant subjects offond popular contemplation have in the lapse of ages been encumberedwith fictitious detail and their various historians seem to haveconsidered the exercise of their imagination innocent and evenmeritorious if they could increase either the vividness of conceptionor the sincerity of belief in their readers</s>  a due consideration ofthat wellknown weakness of the popular mind which renders astatement credible in proportion to the multitude of local andcircumstantial details which accompany it may lead us to look withsome indulgence on the errors however fatal in their issue to thecause they were intended to advance of those weak teachers whothought the acceptance of their general statements of christiandoctrine cheaply won by the help of some simple and generally absurdinventions of detail respecting the life of the virgin or theapostles</s> footnote 7 notes to rogers italy</s> indeed i can hardly imagine the bible to be ever read with trueinterest unless in our reading we feel some longing for furtherknowledge

imagined a picturesque treatment of it</s>  often in examining earlyart we mistake conscientiousness for servility and attribute to theabsence of invention what was indeed the result of the earnestness offaith</s> nor in a merely artistical point of view is it less important tonote that the greatest advance in power was made when painters hadfew subjects to treat</s>  the day has perhaps come when genius should beshown in the discovery of perpetually various interest amidst theincidents of actual life and the absence of inventive capacity isvery assuredly proved by the narrow selection of subjects whichcommonly appear on the walls of our exhibitions</s>  but yet it is to bealways remembered that more originality may be shown in givinginterest to a wellknown subject than in discovering a new one thatthe greatest poets whom the world has seen have been contented toretouch and exalt the creations of their predecessors and that thepainters of the middle ages reached their utmost power by unweariedlytreading a narrow circle of sacred subjects</s> nothing is indeed more notable in the history of art than the exactbalance of its point of excellence in all things midway betweenservitude and license</s>  thus in choice and treatment of subject itbecame paralysed among the byzantines by being mercilessly confinedto a given series of scenes and to a given mode of representing them</s> giotto gave it partial liberty and incipient life by the artists whosucceeded him the range of its scenery was continually extended andthe severity of its style slowly softened to perfection</s>  but the rangewas still in some degree limited by the necessity of its continualsubordination to religious purposes and the style though softenedwas still chaste and though tender selfrestrained</s>  at last came theperiod of license the artist chose his subjects from the lowestscenes of human life and let loose his passions in their portraiture</s> and the kingdom of art passed away</s> as if to direct us to the observation of this great law there is acurious visible type of it in the progress of ornamentation inmanuscripts corresponding with the various changes in

at length therestraint vanishes the freedom changes consequently into license andthe page is covered with exuberant irregular and foolishextravagances of leafage and line</s> it only remains to be noticed that the circumstances of the time atwhich giotto appeared were peculiarly favourable to the development ofgenius owing partly to the simplicity of the methods of practice andpartly to the navet with which art was commonly regarded</s>  giottolike all the great painters of the period was merely a travellingdecorator of walls at so much a day having at florence a bottegaor workshop for

impossible to overratethe value of the work of giotto in the bargello both for its ownintrinsic beauty and as being executed in this year which is notonly that in which the divina commedia opens but as i think theculminating period in the history of the art of the middle ages</s> footnote 10 christian art vol</s>  ii</s>  p</s>  242</s> i may refer the reader to the close of lord lindsays letter

myselfcapable of judging accurately having not seen his finest works atassisi and naples nor carefully studied even those at florence</s>  buti may be permitted to point out one or two peculiar characteristics init which have always struck me forcibly</s> footnote 11 christian art p</s>  260</s> in the first place giotto never finished highly</s>  he was not indeeda loose or sketchy painter but he was by no means a delicate one</s>  hislines as the story of the circle would lead us to expect are alwaysfirm but they are never fine</s>  even in his smallest tempera picturesthe touch is bold and somewhat heavy in his fresco work the handlingis much broader than that of contemporary painters correspondingsomewhat to the character of many of the figures representing plainmasculine kind of people and never reaching any thing like the idealrefinement of the conceptions even of benozzo gozzoli far less ofangelico or francia</s>  for this reason the character of his painting isbetter expressed by bold woodengravings than in general it is likelyto be by any other means</s> again he was a very noble colourist and in his peculiar feeling forbreadth of hue resembled titian more than any other of the florentineschool</s>  that is to say had he been born two centuries later when theart of painting was fully known i believe he would have treated hissubjects much more like titian than like raphael in fact thefrescoes of titian in the chapel beside the church of st</s>  antonio atpadua are in all technical qualities and in many of theirconceptions almost exactly what i believe giotto would have done hadhe lived in titians time</s>  as it was he of course never attainedeither richness or truth of colour but in serene brilliancy he is noteasily rivalled invariably massing his hues in large fields limitingthem firmly and then filling them with subtle gradation</s>  he had thevenetian fondness for bars and stripes not unfrequently castingbarred colours obliquely across the draperies of an upright figurefrom side to side as very notably in the dress of one of themusicians who are playing to the dancing of herodias daughter in oneof his frescoes at santa croce and this predilection was mingledwith the truly medival love of quartering</s> 12 the figure of themadonna in the small tempera pictures in the academy at florence isalways completely divided into two narrow segments by her darkbluerobe</s> footnote 12 i use this heraldic word in an inaccurate sense knowingno other that will express what i meanthe division of the pictureinto quaint segments of alternating colour more marked than any ofthe figure outlines</s> and this is always to be remembered in looking at any engravings fromthe works of giotto for the injury they sustain in being deprived oftheir colour is far greater than in the case of later designers</s>  allworks produced in the fourteenth century agree in being more or lessdecorative they were intended in most instances to be subservient toarchitectural effect and were executed in the manner best calculatedto produce a striking impression when they were seen in a mass</s>  thepainted wall and the painted window were part and parcel of onemagnificent whole and it is as unjust to the work of giotto or ofany contemporary artist to take out a single feature from the seriesand represent it in black and white on a separate page as it would beto take out a compartment of a noble coloured window and engrave itin the same manner</s>  what is at once refined and effective if seen atthe intended distance in unison with the rest of the work becomescoarse and insipid when seen isolated and near and the more skilfullythe design is arranged so as to give full value to the colours whichare introduced in it the more blank and cold will it become when itis deprived of them</s> in our modern art we have indeed lost sight of one great principlewhich regulated that of the middle ages namely that chiaroscuro andcolour are incompatible in their highest degrees</s>  wherever chiaroscuroenters colour must lose some of its brilliancy</s>  there is no shadein a rainbow nor in an opal nor in a piece of motherofpearl norin a welldesigned painted window only various hues of perfectcolour</s>  the best pictures by subduing their colour andconventionalising their chiaroscuro reconcile both in theirdiminished degrees but a perfect light and shade cannot be givenwithout considerable loss of liveliness in colour</s>  hence the supposedinferiority of tintoret to titian</s>  tintoret is in reality thegreater colourist of the two but he could not bear to falsify hislight and shadow enough to set off his colour</s>  titian nearly strikesthe exact mean between the painted glass of the 13th century andrembrandt while giotto closely approaches the system of paintedglass and hence his compositions lose grievously by being translatedinto black and white</s> but even this chiaroscuro however subdued is not without a peculiarcharm and the accompanying engravings possess a marked superiorityover all that have hitherto been made from the works of this painterin rendering this chiaroscuro as far as possible together with theeffect of the local colours</s>  the true appreciation of art has beenretarded for many years by the habit of trusting to outlines as asufficient expression of the sentiment of compositions whereas in alltruly great designs of whatever age it is never the outline but thedisposition of the masses whether of shade or colour on which thereal power of the work depends</s>
 for instance in plate iii</s>  the angelappears to anna the interest of the composition depends entirelyupon the broad shadows which fill the spaces of the chamber and ofthe external passage in which the attendant is sitting</s>  this shadeexplains the whole scene in a moment gives prominence to the curtainand coverlid of the homely bed and the rude chest and trestles whichform the poor furniture of the house and conducts the eye easily andinstantly to the three figures which had the scene been expressed inoutline only we should have had to trace out with some care anddifficulty among the pillars of the loggia and folds of the curtains</s> so also the relief of the faces in light against the dark sky is ofpeculiar value in the compositions no</s>  x</s>  and no</s>  xii</s> the drawing of giotto is of course exceedingly faulty</s>  hisknowledge of the human figure is deficient and this the necessarydrawback in all works of the period occasions an extreme difficultyin rendering them faithfully in an engraving</s>  for wherever there isgood and legitimate drawing the ordinary education of a moderndraughtsman enables him to copy it with tolerable accuracy but whenonce the true forms of nature are departed from it is by no meanseasy to express exactly the error and no more than the error ofhis original</s>  in most cases modern copyists try to modify or hide theweaknesses of the old artby which procedure they very often whollylose its spirit and only half redeem its defects the results beingof course at once false as representations and intrinsicallyvalueless</s>  and just as it requires great courage and skill in aninterpreter to speak out honestly all the rough and rude words of thefirst speaker and to translate deliberately and resolutely in theface of attentive men the expressions of his weakness or impatienceso it requires at once the utmost courage and skill in a copyist totrace faithfully the failures of an imperfect master in the front ofmodern criticism and against the inborn instincts of his own hand andeye</s>  and let him do the best he can he will still find that the graceand life of his original are continually flying off like a vapourwhile all the faults he has so diligently copied sit rigidly staringhim in the facea terrible caput mortuum</s>  it is very necessarythat this should be well understood by the members of the arundelsociety when they hear their engravings severely criticised</s>  it iseasy to produce an agreeable engraving by graceful infidelities butthe entire endeavour of the draughtsmen employed by this society hasbeen to obtain accurately the character of the original and he whonever proposes to himself to rise above the work he is copying mustmost assuredly often fall beneath it</s>  such fall is the inherent andinevitable penalty on all absolute copyism and wherever the copy ismade with sincerity the fall must be endured with patience</s>  it willnever be an utter or a degrading fall that is reserved for those wholike vulgar translators wilfully quit the hand of their master andhave no strength of their own</s> lastly</s>  it is especially to be noticed that these works of giotto incommon with all others of the period are independent of all theinferior sources of pictorial interest</s>  they never show the slightestattempt at imitative realisation they are simple suggestions ofideas claiming no regard except for the inherent value of thethoughts</s>  there is no filling of the landscape with variety ofscenery architecture or incident as in the works of benozzo gozzolior perugino no wealth of jewellery and gold spent on the dresses ofthe figures as in the delicate labours of angelico or gentile dafabriano</s>  the background is never more than a few gloomy masses ofrock with a tree or two and perhaps a fountain the architecture ismerely what is necessary to explain the scene the dresses are paintedsternly on the heroic principle of sir joshua reynoldsthat draperyis to be drapery and nothing morethere is no silk nor velvetnor distinguishable material of any kind the whole power of thepicture is rested on the three simple essentials of paintingpurecolour noble form noble thought</s> we moderns educated in reality far more under the influence of thedutch masters than the italian and taught to look for realisation inall things have been in the habit of casting scorn on these earlyitalian works as if their simplicity were the result of ignorancemerely</s>  when we know a little more of art in general we shall beginto suspect that a man of giottos power of mind did not altogethersuppose his clusters of formal trees or diminutive masses ofarchitecture to be perfect representations of the woods of judea orof the streets of jerusalem we shall begin to understand that thereis a symbolical art which addresses the imagination as well as arealist art which supersedes it and that the powers of contemplationand conception which could be satisfied or excited by these simpletypes of natural things were infinitely more majestic than thosewhich are so dependent on the completeness of what is presented tothem as to be paralysed by an error in perspective or stifled by theabsence of atmosphere</s> nor is the healthy simplicity of the period less marked in theselection than in the treatment of subjects</s>  it has in these daysbecome necessary for the painter who desires popularity to accumulateon his canvas whatever is startling in aspect or emotion and todrain even to exhaustion the vulgar sources of the pathetic</s>  modernsentiment at once feverish and feeble remains unawakened except bythe violences of gaiety or gloom and the eye refuses to pause exceptwhen it is tempted by the luxury of beauty or fascinated by theexcitement of terror</s>  it ought not therefore to be without arespectful admiration that we find the masters of the fourteenthcentury dwelling on moments of the most subdued and tender feelingand leaving the spectator to trace the undercurrents of thought whichlink them with future events of mightier interest and fill with aprophetic power and mystery scenes in themselves so simple as themeeting of a master with his herdsmen among the hills or the returnof a betrothed virgin to her house</s> illustrationit is however to be remembered that this quietness in character ofsubject was much more possible to an early painter owing to theconnection in which his works were to be seen</s>  a modern pictureisolated and portable must rest all its claims to attention on itsown actual subject but the pictures of the early masters were nearlyalways parts of a consecutive and stable series in which many weresubdued like the connecting passages of a prolonged poem in order toenhance the value or meaning of others</s>  the arrangement of thesubjects in the arena chapel is in this respect peculiarly skilfuland to that arrangement we must now direct our attention</s> illustration interior of the arena chapel padua looking eastward</s> it was before noticed that the chapel was built between 1300 and 1306</s> the architecture of italy in the beginning of the fourteenth centuryis always pure and often severe but this chapel is remarkable evenamong the severest forms for the absence of decoration</s>  its planseen in the marginal figure on p</s>  26 is a pure oblong with a narrowadvanced tribune terminating in a trilateral apse</s>  selvatico quotesfrom the german writer stieglitz some curious observations on theapparent derivation of its proportions in common with those of otherbuildings of the time from the number of sides of its apse</s>  withoutentering into these particulars it may be noted that the apse is justonehalf the width of the body of the chapel and that the length fromthe extremity of the tribune to the west end is just seven times thewidth of the apse</s>  the whole of the body of the chapel was painted bygiotto the walls and roof being entirely covered either with hisfiguredesigns or with various subordinate decorations connecting andenclosing them</s> the woodcut on p</s>  27 represents the arrangement of the frescoes on thesides extremities and roof of the chapel</s>  the spectator is supposedto be looking from the western entrance towards the tribune having onhis right the south side which is pierced by six tall windows and onwhich the frescoes are therefore reduced in number</s>  the north side ispierced by no windows and on it therefore the frescoes arecontinuous lighted from the south windows</s>  the several spacesnumbered 1 to 38 are occupied by a continuous series of subjectsrepresenting the life of the virgin and of christ the narrow panelsbelow marked a b c c</s>  are filled by figures of thecardinal virtues and their opponent vices on the lunette above thetribune is painted a christ in glory and at the western extremity thelast judgment</s>  thus the walls of the chapel are covered with acontinuous meditative poem on the mystery of the incarnation the actsof redemption the vices and virtues of mankind as proceeding fromtheir scorn or acceptance of that redemption and their finaljudgment</s> the first twelve pictures of the series are exclusively devoted to theapocryphal history of the birth and life of the virgin</s>  this theprotestant spectator will observe perhaps with little favour moreespecially as only two compartments are given to the ministry ofchrist between his baptism and entry into jerusalem</s>  due weight ishowever to be allowed to lord lindsays remark that the legendaryhistory of the virgin was of peculiar importance in this chapel asespecially dedicated to her service and i think also that giottodesired to unite the series of compositions in one continuous actionfeeling that to have enlarged on the separate miracles of christsministry would have interrupted the onward course of thought</s>  as itis the mind is led from the first humiliation of joachim to theascension of christ in one unbroken and progressive chain of scenesthe ministry of christ being completely typified by his first and lastconspicuous miracle while the very unimportance of some of thesubjects as for instance that of the watching the rods is useful indirecting the spectator rather to pursue the course of the narrativethan to pause in satisfied meditation upon any single incident</s>  and itcan hardly be doubted that giotto had also a peculiar pleasure indwelling on the circumstances of the shepherd life of the father ofthe virgin owing to its resemblance to that of his own early years</s> the incidents represented in these first twelve paintings are recordedin the two apocryphal gospels known as the protevangelion andgospel of st</s>  mary</s> 13 but on comparing the statements in thesewritings which by the by are in nowise consistent with each otherwith the paintings in the arena chapel it appeared to me that giottomust occasionally have followed some more detailed traditions than arefurnished by either of them seeing that of one or two subjects theapocryphal gospels gave no distinct or sufficient explanation</s> fortunately however in the course of some other researches i metwith a manuscript in the british museum harl</s>  3571 containing acomplete history of the most holy family written in northernitalian of about the middle of the 14th century and appearing to beone of the forms of the legend which giotto has occasionally followedin preference to the statements of the protevangelion</s>  i havetherefore in illustration of the paintings given when it seemeduseful some portions of this manuscript and these with one or twoverses of the commonly received accounts will be found generallyenough to interpret sufficiently the meaning of the painter</s> footnote 13 it has always appeared strange to me thatecclesiastical history should possess no more authentic records of thelife of the virgin before the period at which the narrative of st</s> luke commences than these apocryphal gospels which are as wretchedin style as untrustworthy in matter and are evidently nothing morethan a collection in rude imitation of the style of the evangelistsof such floating traditions as became current among the weakchristians of the earlier ages when their inquiries respecting thehistory of mary were met by the obscurity under which the divine willhad veiled her humble person and character</s>  there must always besomething painful to those who are familiar with the scriptures inreading these feeble and foolish mockeries of the manner of theinspired writers but it will be proper nevertheless to give theexact words in which the scenes represented by giotto were recorded tohim</s> the following complete list of the subjects will at once enable thereader to refer any of them to its place in the series and on thewalls of the building and i have only now to

instantly make manifest in it a strangeseriousness and dignity and slowness of motion resulting chiefly fromthe excessive simplicity of all its terminal lines</s>  observe forinstance the pure wave from the back of the virgins head to theground and again the delicate swelling line along her shoulder andleft arm opposed to the nearly unbroken fall of the drapery of thefigure in front</s>  it

from all the traditions of his time for i am aware of nopainting of this scene during the course of the thirteenth andfollowing centuries which does not represent the virgin as perfectlytranquil receiving the message of the angel in solemn thought andgentle humility but without a shadow of fear</s>  it was reserved for thepainters of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to change angelicmajesty into reckless impetuosity and maiden meditation into panicdread</s> the face of the virgin is slightly disappointing</s>  giotto never reacheda very high standard of beauty in feature

salutation</s> this picture placed beneath the figure of the virgin annunciate atthe east end of the chapel and necessarily small as will be seen bythe plan in consequence of the space occupied by the arch which itflanks begins the second or lower series of frescoes being at thesame time the first of the great chain of more familiar subjects inwhich we have the power of comparing the conceptions of giotto notonly with the designs of earlier ages but with the efforts whichsubsequent masters have made to exalt or vary the ideas of theprincipal scenes in the life of the virgin and of christ</s>  the twopaintings of the angel gabriel and the virgin annunciate hardlyprovoke such a comparison being almost statuelike in the calmsubjection of all dramatic interest to the symmetrical dignity andbeauty of the two figures leading as they do the whole system ofthe decoration of the chapel but this of the salutation is treatedwith no such reference to the architecture and at once challengescomparison with the works of later masters</s>
nor is the challenge feebly maintained</s>  i have no hesitation insaying that among all the renderings of this scene which now existi remember none which gives the pure depth and plain facts of it soperfectly as this of giottos</s>  of majestic women bowing themselves tobeautiful and meek girls both wearing gorgeous robes in the midst oflovely scenery or at the doors of palladian palaces we have enoughbut i do not know any picture which seems to me to give so truthful anidea of the action with which elizabeth and mary must actually havemetwhich gives so exactly the way in which elizabeth would stretchher arms and stoop and gaze into marys face and the way in whichmarys hand would slip beneath elizabeths arms and raise her up tokiss her</s>  i know not any elizabeth so full of intense love and joyand humbleness hardly any madonna in which tenderness and dignityare so quietly blended</s>  she not less humble and yet accepting thereverence of elizabeth as her appointed portion saying in hersimplicity and truth he that is mighty hath magnified me and holyis his name</s>  the longer that this group is looked upon the more itwill be felt that giotto has done well to withdraw from it nearly allaccessories of landscape and adornment and to trust it to the powerof its own deep expression</s>  we may gaze upon the two silent figuresuntil their silence seems to be broken and the words

power and space of that heaven and earth whose lord isbeing laid in the mangercradle</s> there is an exquisite truth and sweetness in the way the virgin turnsupon the couch in order herself to assist in laying the child down</s> giotto is in this exactly faithful to the scriptural words shewrapped the child in swaddlingclothes and laid him in a manger</s> joseph sits beneath in meditation above the angels all exultingand as it were confused with joy flutter and circle in the air likebirdsthree looking up to the fathers throne with praise andthankfulness one stooping to adore the prince of peace one flying totell the shepherds</s>  there is something to me peculiarly affecting inthis disorder of theirs even angels as it were breaking their rankswith wonder and not knowing how to utter their gladness and passionof praise</s>  there is noticeable here as in all works of this earlytime a certain confidence in the way in which the angels trust totheir wings very characteristic of a period of bold and simpleconception</s>  modern science has taught us that a wing cannot beanatomically joined to a shoulder and in proportion as paintersapproach more and more to the scientific as distinguished from thecontemplative state of mind they put the wings of their angels onmore timidly and dwell with greater emphasis upon the human form andwith less upon the wings until these last become a species ofdecorative appendagea mere sign of an angel</s>  but in giottos timean angel was a complete creature as much believed in as a bird andthe way in which it would or might cast itself into the air and leanhither and thither upon its plumes was as naturally apprehended asthe manner of flight of a chough or a starling</s>  hence dantes simpleand most exquisite synonym for angel bird of god and hence also avariety and picturesqueness in the expression of the movements of theheavenly hierarchies by the earlier painters ill replaced by thepowers of foreshortening and throwing naked limbs into fantasticpositions which appear in the cherubic groups of later times</s> it is needless to point out the frank association of the twoeventsthe nativity and appearance of the angel to the shepherds</s> they are constantly thus joined but i do not remember any otherexample in which they are joined so boldly</s>  usually the shepherds areseen in the distance or are introduced in some ornamental border orother inferior place</s>  the view of painting as a mode of suggestingrelative or consecutive thoughts rather than a realisation of any onescene is seldom so fearlessly asserted even by giotto as here inplacing the flocks of the shepherds at the foot of the virgins bed</s> this bed it will be noticed is on a shelf of rock</s>  this is incompliance with the idea founded on the protevangelion and theapocryphal book known as the gospel of infancy that our saviour wasborn in a cave associated with the scriptural statement that he waslaid in a manger of which the apocryphal gospels do not speak</s> the vain endeavour to exalt the awe of the moment of the savioursbirth has turned in these gospels the outhouse of the inn into aspecies of subterranean chapel full of incense

least deprecate lord lindsayscharacterising this design of giottos merely as the byzantinecomposition</s>  it contains indeed nothing more than the materials ofthe byzantine composition but i know no byzantine nativity which atall resembles it in the grace and life of its action</s>  and for full acentury after giottos time in northern europe the nativity wasrepresented in a far more conventional manner than this usually onlythe heads of the ox and ass are seen and they are arranging orholding with their mouths the drapery of the couch of the child whois not being laid in it by the virgin but raised upon a kind oftablet high above her in the centre of the group</s>  all these earlydesigns without exception however agree in expressing a certaindegree of languor in the figure of the virgin and in making herrecumbent on the bed</s>  it is not till the fifteenth century that she isrepresented as exempt from suffering and immediately kneeling inadoration before the child</s>           xvii</s> the wise mens offering</s> this is a subject which has been so great a favourite with thepainters of later periods and on which so much rich incidentalinvention has been lavished that giottos rendering of it cannot butbe felt to be barren</s>  it is in fact perhaps the least powerful ofall the series and its effect is further marred by what lord lindsayhas partly noted the appearanceperhaps accidental but if soexceedingly unskilfulof matronly corpulence in the figure of themadonna</s>  the unfortunate failure in the representation of the legs andchests of the camels and the awkwardness of the attempt to render theaction of kneeling in the foremost king put the whole compositioninto the classnot in itself an uninteresting oneof the slips orshortcomings of great masters</s>  one incident in it only is worthobserving</s>  in other compositions of this time and in many later onesthe kings are generally presenting their offerings themselves and thechild takes them in his hand or smiles at them</s>  the painters whothought this an undignified conception left the presents in the handsof the attendants of the magi</s>  but giotto considers how presentswould be received by an actual king and as what has been offered to amonarch is delivered to the care of his attendants giotto puts awaiting angel to receive the gifts as not worthy to be placed in thehands of the infant</s>           xviii</s> the presentation in the temple</s> this design is one of those which are peculiarly characteristic ofgiotto as the head of the naturalisti</s> 21 no painter before his timewould have dared to represent the child jesus as desiring to quit thearms of simeon or the virgin as in some sort interfering with theprophets earnest contemplation of the child by stretching her arms toreceive him</s>  the idea is evidently a false one quite unworthy of thehigher painters of the religious school and it is a matter ofpeculiar interest to see what must have been the strength of giottoslove of plain facts which could force him to stoop so low in theconception of this most touching scene</s>  the child does not it will beobserved merely stretch its arm to the madonna but is evenstruggling to escape violently raising the left foot</s>  but there isanother incident in the composition witnessing as notably to giottospowerful grasp of all the facts of his

inadequately represented inpainting because it is impossible to imply the fact of simeonshaving waited so long in the hope of beholding his lord or to informthe spectator of the feeling in which he utters the song of hopefulfilled</s>  giotto has it seems to me done all that he could to makeus remember this peculiar meaning of the scene for i think i cannotbe deceived in interpreting the flying

the flight is renderedmore thrilling in late compositions by the introduction of armedpursuers</s>  giotto has given a far more quiet deliberate and probablecharacter to the whole scene while he has fully marked the fact ofdivine protection and command in the figure of the guiding angel</s>  noris the picture less interesting in its marked expression of the night</s> the figures are all distinctly seen and there is no broaddistribution of the gloom but the vigorous blackness of the dress ofthe attendant who holds the bridle and the scattered glitter of thelights on the madonnas robe

the figure of the virgin is singularly dignified the broad and severecurves traced by the hem and deepest folds of her dress materiallyconducing to the nobleness of the group</s>  the child is partly sustainedby a band fastened round the madonnas neck</s>  the quaint and delicatepattern on this band together with that of the embroidered edges ofthe dress is of great value in opposing and making more manifest thesevere and grave outlines of the whole figure whose impressiveness isalso partly increased by the rise of the mountain just above it likea tent</s>  a vulgar composer would have moved

massacre of the innocents</s> of all the series this composition is the one which exhibits most ofgiottos weaknesses</s>  all early work is apt to fail in the rendering ofviolent action but giotto is

children</s>  it is in fact almost impossibleto understand how any italian familiar with the eager gesticulationsof the lower orders of his countrywomen on the smallest points ofdispute with each other should have been incapable of giving moreadequate expression of true action and passion to the group ofmothers and if i were not afraid of being accused of specialpleading i might insist at some length on a dim faith of my own thatgiotto thought the actual agony and strivings of the probable sceneunfit for pictorial treatment or for common contemplation and thathe chose rather to give motionless types and personifications of thesoldiers and women than to use his strength and realistic faculty inbringing before the vulgar eye the unseemly struggle or unspeakablepain</s>  the formal arrangement of the heap of corpses in the centre ofthe group the crowded standing of the mothers as in a choir ofsorrow the actual presence of herod to whom some of them appear tobe appealingall seem to me to mark this intention and to make thecomposition only a symbol or shadow of the great deed of massacre nota realisation of its visible continuance at any moment</s>  i will notpress this conjecture but will only add that if it be so i thinkgiotto was perfectly right and that a picture thus conceived mighthave been deeply impressive had it been more successfully executedand a calmer

no value and this is the more remarkable as therewere fewer precedents of treatment in this case than in any of theothers and it might have been anticipated that giotto would have puthimself to some

act whichthough there is no need to deny there is little evidence to certifybut we may joyfully accept as its first indisputable meaning that ofsimple kindness the wine being provided here when needed as thebread and fish were afterwards for the hungry multitudes</s>  the wholevalue of the miracle in its serviceable tenderness is at onceeffaced when the marriage is supposed as by veronese and otherartists of later times to have taken place at the house of a richman</s>  for the rest giotto sufficiently implies by the lifted hand ofthe madonna and the action of the fingers of the bridegroom as ifthey held sacramental bread that there lay a deeper meaning under themiracle for those who could accept it</s>  how all miracle is acceptedby common humanity he has also shown in the figure of the ruler ofthe feast drinking</s>  this unregarding forgetfulness of presentspiritual power is similarly marked by veronese by placing the figureof a fool with his bauble immediately underneath that of christ andby making a cat play with her shadow in one of the winevases</s> it is to be remembered however in examining all pictures of thissubject that the miracle was not made manifest to all the gueststonone indeed seemingly except christs own disciples the ruler ofthe feast and probably most of those present except the servants whodrew the water knew or observed nothing of what was passing andmerely thought the good wine had been kept until now</s>           xxiv</s> the raising of lazarus</s> in consequence of the intermediate position which giotto occupiesbetween the byzantine and naturalist schools two relations oftreatment are to be generally noted in his work</s>  as compared with thebyzantines he is a realist whose power consists in the introductionof living character and various incidents modifying the formerlyreceived byzantine symbols</s>  so far as he has to do this he is arealist of the purest kind endeavoring always to conceive eventsprecisely as they were likely to have happened not to idealise theminto forms artfully impressive to the spectator</s>  but in so far as hewas compelled to retain or did not wish to reject the figurativecharacter of the byzantine symbols he stands opposed to succeedingrealists in the quantity of meaning which probably lies hidden in anycomposition as well as in the simplicity with which he will probablytreat it in order to enforce or guide to this meaning the figuresbeing often letters of a hieroglyphic which he will not multiplylest he should lose in force of suggestion what he gained in dramaticinterest</s> none of the compositions display more clearly this typical andreflective character than that of the raising of lazarus</s>  laterdesigners dwell on vulgar conditions of wonder or horror such as theycould conceive likely to attend the resuscitation of a corpse butwith giotto the physical reanimation is the type of a spiritual oneand though shown to be miraculous is yet in all its deeper aspectsunperturbed and calm in awfulness</s>  it is also visibly gradual</s>  hisface was bound about with a napkin</s>  the nearest apostle has withdrawnthe covering from the face and looks for the command which shallrestore it from wasted corruption and sealed blindness to livingpower and light</s> nor is it i believe without meaning that the two apostles ifindeed they are intended for apostles who stand at lazarus sidewear a different dress from those who follow christ</s>  i suppose themto be intended for images of the christian and jewish churches intheir ministration to the dead soul the one removing its bonds butlooking to christ for the word and power of life the other inactiveand helplessthe veil upon its facein dread while the principalfigure fulfils the order it receives in fearless simplicity</s>           xxv</s> the entry into jerusalem</s> this design suffers much from loss of colour in translation</s>  itsdecorative effect depends on the deep blue ground relieving thedelicate foliage and the local colours of dresses and architecture</s>
 itis also one of those which are most directly opposed to modernfeeling the sympathy of the spectator with the passion of the crowdbeing somewhat rudely checked by the grotesque action of two of theforemost figures</s>  we ought however rather to envy the deepseriousness which could not be moved from dwelling on the real powerof the scene by any ungracefulness or familiarity of circumstance</s> among men whose minds are rightly toned nothing is ludicrous itmust if an act be either right or wrong noble or base if a thingseen it must either be ugly or beautiful and what is either wrong ordeformed is not among noble persons in anywise subject for laughterbut in the precise degree of its wrongness or deformity a subject ofhorror</s>  all perception of what in the modern european mind fallsunder the general head of the ludicrous is either childish orprofane often healthy as indicative of vigorous animal life butalways degraded in its relation to manly conditions of thought</s>  it hasa secondary use in its power of detecting vulgar imposture but itonly obtains this power by denying the highest truths</s>           xxvi</s> the expulsion from the temple</s> more properly the expulsion from the outer court of the temple courtof gentiles as giotto has indicated by placing the porch of thetemple itself in the background</s> the design shows as clearly as that of the massacre of the innocentsgiottos want of power and partly of desire to represent rapid orforceful action</s>  the raising of the right hand not holding anyscourge resembles the action afterwards adopted by oreagna andfinally by michael angelo in his last judgment and my belief is thatgiotto considered this act of christs as partly typical of the finaljudgment the pharisees being placed on the left hand and thedisciples on the right</s>  from the faded remains of the fresco thedraughtsman could not determine what animals are intended by those onthe left hand</s>  but the most curious incident so far as i know foundonly in this design of the expulsion no subsequent painter repeatingit is the sheltering of the two children one of them carrying adove under the arm and cloak of two disciples</s>  many meanings mighteasily be suggested in this but i see no evidence for the adoption ofany distinct one</s>           xxvii</s> the hiring of judas</s> the only point of material interest presented by this design is thedecrepit and distorted shadow of the demon respecting which it may bewell to remind the reader that all the great italian thinkersconcurred in assuming decrepitude or disease as well as ugliness tobe a characteristic of all natures of evil</s>  whatever the extent of thepower granted to evil spirits it was always abominable andcontemptible no element of beauty or heroism was ever allowed toremain however obscured in the aspect of a fallen angel</s>  also thedemoniacal nature was shown in acts of betrayal torture or wantonhostility never in

only by a careful consideration of the meaning of that fresco</s>           xxviii</s> the last supper</s> i have not examined the original fresco with care enough to be able tosay whether the uninteresting quietness of its design is redeemed bymore than ordinary attention to expression it is one of the leastattractive subjects in the arena chapel and always sure to be passedover in any general observation of the series nevertheless howeverunfavourably it may at first contrast with the designs of latermasters and especially with leonardos the reader should not fail toobserve that giottos aim had it been successful was the higher ofthe two as giving truer rendering of the probable fact</s>  there is nodistinct evidence in the sacred text of the annunciation of comingtreachery having produced among the disciples the violent surprise andagitation represented by leonardo</s>  naturally they would not at firstunderstand what was meant</s>  they knew nothing distinctly of themachinations of the priests and so little of the character orpurposes of judas that even after he had received the sop which wasto point him out to the others as falseand after they had heard theinjunction that thou doest do quicklythe other disciples hadstill no conception of the significance either of the saying or theact they thought that christ meant he was to buy something for

paralysed state ofthe mans mind</s>  he had talked with the priests covenanted with themand even sought opportunity to bring jesus into their hands but whilesuch opportunity was wanting the act had never presented itself fullyto him for adoption or rejection</s>  he had toyed with it dreamed overit hesitated and procrastinated over it as a stupid and cowardlyperson would such as traitors are apt to be</s>  but the way of retreatwas yet open the conquest of the temper not complete</s>  only afterreceiving the sop the idea finally presented itself clearly and wasaccepted tonight while he is in the garden i can do it and iwill</s>  and giotto has indicated this distinctly by giving judas stillthe apostles nimbus both in this subject and in that of the washingof the feet while it is taken

showing that this was thereal state of their minds we shall find giotto take cognisance of inthe next fresco</s>           xxix</s> the washing of the feet</s> in this design it will be observed there are still the twelvedisciples and the nimbus is yet given to judas though as it weresetting his face not being seen</s> considering the deep interest and importance of every circumstance ofthe last supper i cannot understand how preachers and commentatorspass by the difficulty of clearly understanding the periods indicatedin st</s>  johns account of it</s>  it seems that christ must have risenwhile they were still eating must have washed their feet as they sateor reclined at the table just as the magdalen had washed his own feetin the pharisees house that this done he returned to the tableand the disciples continuing to eat presently gave the sop to judas</s> for st</s>  john says that he having received the sop went immediatelyout yet that christ had washed his feet is certain from the wordsye are clean but not all</s>  whatever view the reader may ondeliberation choose to accept giottos is clear namely that thoughnot cleansed by the baptism judas was yet capable of being cleansed</s> the devil had not entered into him at the time of the washing of thefeet and he retains the sign of an apostle</s> the composition is one of the most beautiful of the series especiallyowing to the submissive grace of the two standing figures</s>           xxx</s> the kiss of judas</s> for the first time we have giottos idea of the face of the traitorclearly shown</s>  it is not i think traceable through any of theprevious series and it has often surprised me to observe howimpossible it was in the works of almost any of the sacred painters todetermine by the mere cast of feature which was meant for the falseapostle</s>  here however giottos theory of physiognomy and togetherwith it his idea of the character of judas are perceivable enough</s>  itis evident that he looks upon judas mainly as a sensual dullard andfoulbrained fool a man in no respect exalted in bad eminence oftreachery above the mass of common traitors but merely a distincttype of the eternal treachery to good in vulgar men which stoopsbeneath and opposes in its appointed measure the life and efforts ofall noble persons their natural enemies in this world as the slimelies under a clear stream running through an earthy meadow</s>  ourcareless and thoughtless english use of the word into which the greekdiabolos has been shortened blinds us in general to the meaning ofdeviltry which in its essence is nothing else than slander ortraitorhoodthe accusing and giving up of good</s>  in particular it hasblinded us to the meaning of christs words have not i chosen youtwelve and one of you is a traitor and accuser</s>  and led us to thinkthat the one of you is a devil indicated some greater than humanwickedness in judas whereas the practical meaning of the entire factof judas ministry and fall is that out of any twelve men chosen forthe forwarding of any purposeor much more out of any twelve menwe meetone probably is or will be a judas</s> the modern german renderings of all the scenes of christs life inwhich the traitor is conspicuous are very curious in their vulgarmisunderstanding of the history and their consequent endeavours torepresent judas as more diabolic than selfish treacherous andstupid men are in all their generations</s>  they paint him usuallyprojected against strong effects of light in luridchiaroscuroenlarging the whites of his eyes and making him frowngrin and gnash his teeth on all occasions so as to appear among theother apostles invariably in the aspect of a gorgon</s> how much more deeply giotto has fathomed the fact i believe all menwill admit who have sufficient purity and abhorrence of falsehood torecognise it in its daily presence and who know how the devilsstrongest work is done for him by men who are too bestial tounderstand what they betray</s>           xxxi</s> christ before caiaphas</s> little is to be observed in this design of any distinctive merit itis only a somewhat completer version of the ordinary representationgiven in illuminated missals and other conventual work suggesting asif they had happened at the same moment the answer if i have spokenevil bear witness of the evil and the accusation of blasphemy whichcauses the highpriest to rend his clothes</s> apparently distrustful of his power of obtaining interest of a higherkind giotto has treated the enrichments more carefully than usualdown even to the steps of the highpriests seat</s>  the torch and barredshutters conspicuously indicate its being now dead of night</s>  that thetorch is darker than the chamber if not an error in the drawing isprobably the consequence of a darkening alteration in the yellowcolours used for the flame</s>           xxxii</s> the scourging of christ</s> it is characteristic of giottos rational and human view of allsubjects admitting such aspect that he has insisted here chiefly onthe dejection and humiliation of christ making no attempt to suggestto the spectator any other divinity than that of patience made perfectthrough suffering</s>  angelicos conception of the same subject is higherand more mystical</s>  he takes the moment when christ is blindfolded andexaggerates almost into monstrosity the vileness of feature andbitterness of sneer in the questioners prophesy unto us who is hethat smote thee but the bearing of the person of christ is entirelycalm and unmoved and his eyes open are seen through the bindingveil indicating the ceaseless omniscience</s> this mystical rendering is again rejected by the later realisticpainters but while the earlier designers with giotto at their headdwelt chiefly on the humiliation and the mockery later painters dwelton the physical pain</s>  in titians great picture of this subject in thelouvre one of the executioners is thrusting the thorncrown down uponthe brow with his rod and the action of christ is that of a personsuffering extreme physical agony</s> no representations of the scene exist to my knowledge in which themockery is either sustained with indifference or rebuked by any sternor appealing expression of feature yet one of these two forms ofendurance would appear to a modern habit of thought the most naturaland probable</s>           xxxiii</s> christ bearing his cross</s> this design is one of great nobleness and solemnity in the isolationof the principal figure and removal of all motives of interestdepending on accessories or merely temporary incidents</s>  even thevirgin and her attendant women are kept in the background all appealfor sympathy through physical suffering is disdained</s>  christ is notrepresented as borne down by the weight of the cross nor as urgedforward by the impatience of the executioners</s>  the thing to beshownthe unspeakable mysteryis the simple fact the bearing ofthe cross by the redeemer</s>  it would be vain to compare the respectivemerits or value of a design thus treated and of one like veronesesof this same subject in which every essential accessory and probableincident is completely conceived</s>  the abstract and symbolicalsuggestion will always appeal to one order of minds the dramaticcompleteness to another</s>
 unquestionably the last is the greaterachievement of intellect but the manner and habit of thought areperhaps loftier in giotto</s>  veronese leads us to perceive the realityof the act and giotto to understand its intention</s>           xxxiv</s> the crucifixion</s> the treatment of this subject was in giottos time so rigidly fixedby tradition that it was out of his power to display any of his ownspecial modes of thought and as in the bearing of the cross sohere but yet more distinctly the temporary circumstances are littleregarded the significance of the event being alone cared for</s>  buteven long after this time in all the pictures of the crucifixion bythe great masters with the single exception perhaps of that bytintoret in the church of san cassano at venice there is a tendencyto treat the painting as a symmetrical image or collective symbol ofsacred mysteries rather than as a dramatic representation</s>  even intintorets great crucifixion in the school of st</s>  roch the group offainting women forms a kind of pedestal for the cross</s>  the flyingangels in the composition before us are thus also treated with arestraint hardly passing the limits of decorative symbolism</s>  thefading away of their figures into flamelike cloud may perhaps befounded on the verse he maketh his angels spirits his ministers aflame of fire though erroneously the right reading of that versebeing he maketh the winds his messengers and the flaming fire hisservant but it seems to me to give a greater sense of possibletruth than the entire figures treading the clouds with naked feet ofperugino and his successors</s>           xxxv</s> the entombment</s> i do not consider that in fulfilling the task of interpreter intrustedto me with respect to this series of engravings i may in generalpermit myself to unite with it the duty of a critic</s>  but in theexecution of a laborious series of engravings some must of course bebetter some worse and it would be unjust no less to the reader thanto giotto if i allowed this plate to pass without some admission ofits inadequacy</s>  it may possibly have been treated with a little lesscare than the rest in the knowledge that the finished plate alreadyin the possession of the members of the arundel society supersededany effort with inferior means be that as it may the tenderness ofgiottos composition is in the engraving before us lost to anunusual degree</s> it may be generally observed that the passionateness of the sorrowboth of the virgin and disciples is represented by giotto and allgreat following designers as reaching its crisis at the entombmentnot at the crucifixion</s>  the expectation that after experiencing everyform of human suffering christ would yet come down from the cross orin some other visible and immediate manner achieve for himself thevictory might be conceived to have supported in a measure the mindsof those among his disciples who watched by his cross</s>  but when theagony was closed by actual death and the full strain was put upontheir faith by their laying in the sepulchre wrapped in hisgraveclothes him in whom they trusted that it had been he whichshould have redeemed israel their sorrow became suddenly hopeless agulf of horror opened almost at unawares under their feet and inthe poignancy of her astonied despair it was no marvel that the agonyof the madonna in the piet became subordinately associated in themind of the early church with that of their lord himselfa type ofconsummate human suffering</s>           xxxvi</s> the resurrection</s> quite one of the loveliest designs of the series</s>  it was a favouritesubject with giotto meeting in all its conditions his love of whatwas most mysterious yet most comforting and full of hope in thedoctrines of his religion</s>  his joy in the fact of the resurrectionhis sense of its function as the key and primal truth ofchristianity was far too deep to allow him to dwell on any of itsminor circumstances as later designers did representing the momentof bursting the tomb and the supposed terror of its guards</s>  withgiotto the leading thought is not of physical reanimation nor of themomentarily exerted power of breaking the bars of the grave but theconsummation of christs work in the first manifesting to human eyesand the eyes of one who had loved him and believed in him his powerto take again the life he had laid down</s>  this first appearance to herout of whom he had cast seven devils is indeed the very central factof the resurrection</s>  the keepers had not seen christ they had seenonly the angel descending whose countenance was like lightning forfear of him they became as dead yet this fear though great enough tocause them to swoon was so far conquered at the return of morningthat they were ready to take moneypayment for giving a false reportof the circumstances</s>  the magdalen therefore is the first witness ofthe resurrection to the love for whose sake much had been forgiventhis gift is also first given and as the first witness of the truthso she is the first messenger of the gospel</s>  to the apostles it wasgranted to proclaim the resurrection to all nations but the magdalenwas bidden to proclaim it to the apostles</s> in the chapel of the bargello giotto has rendered this scene with yetmore passionate sympathy</s>  here however its significance is morethoughtfully indicated through all the accessories down even to thewithered trees above the sepulchre while those of the garden burstinto leaf</s>  this could hardly escape notice when the barren boughs werecompared by the spectator with the rich foliage of the neighbouringdesigns though in the detached plate it might easily be lost sightof</s>           xxxvii</s> the ascension</s> giotto continues to exert all his strength on these closing subjects</s> none of the byzantine or earlier italian painters ventured tointroduce the entire figure of christ in this scene they showed thefeet only concealing the body according to the text a cloudreceived him out of their sight</s>  this composition graceful as it isdaring conveys the idea of ascending motion more forcibly than anythat i remember by other than venetian painters</s>  much of its powerdepends on the continuity of line obtained by the halffloatingfigures of the two warning angels</s> i cannot understand why this subject was so seldom treated byreligious painters for the harmony of christian creed depends as muchupon it as on the resurrection itself while the circumstances of theascension in their brightness promise miraculousness and directappeal to all the assembled apostles seem more fitted to attract thejoyful contemplation of all who received the faith</s>  how morbid andhow deeply to be mourned was the temper of the church which could notbe satisfied without perpetual representation of the tortures ofchrist but rarely dwelt on his triumph</s>  how more than strange theconcessions to this feebleness by its greatest teachers such as thatof titian who though he paints the assumption of the madonna ratherthan a piet paints the scourging and the entombment of christ withhis best powerbut never the ascension</s>           xxxviii</s> the descent of the holy spirit</s> this last subject of the series the quietest and least interesting intreatment yet illustrates sadly and forcibly the vital differencebetween ancient and modern art</s> the worst characters of modern work result from its constant appeal toour desire of change and pathetic excitement while the best featuresof the elder art appealed to love of contemplation</s>  it would appear tobe the object of the truest artists to give permanence to images suchas we should always desire to behold and might behold withoutagitation while the inferior branches of design are concerned withthe acuter passions which depend on the turn of a narrative or thecourse of an emotion</s>  where it is possible to unite these two sourcesof pleasure and as in the assumption of titian an action ofabsorbing interest is united with perfect and perpetual elements ofbeauty the highest point of conception would appear to have beentouched but in the degree in which the interest of actionsupersedes beauty of form and colour the art is lowered and wherereal deformity enters in any other degree than as a momentary shadowor opposing force the art is illegitimate</s>  such art can exist only byaccident when a nation has forgotten or betrayed the eternal purposesof its genius and gives birth to painters whom it cannot teach andto teachers whom it will not hear</s>  the best talents of all our englishpainters have been spent either in endeavours to find room for theexpression of feelings which no master guided to a worthy end or toobtain the attention of a public whose mind was dead to naturalbeauty by sharpness of satire or variety of dramatic circumstance</s> the work to which england is now devoting herself withdraws her eyesfrom beauty as her heart from rest nor do i conceive any revival ofgreat art to be possible among us while the nation continues in itspresent temper</s>  as long as it can bear to see misery and squalor inits streets it can neither invent nor accept human beauty in itspictures and so long as in passion of rivalry or thirst of gain itcrushes the roots of happiness and forsakes the ways of peace thegreat souls whom it may chance to produce will all pass away from ithelpless in error in wrath or in silence</s>  amiable visionaries mayretire into the delight of devotional abstraction strong men of theworld may yet hope to do service by their rebuke or their satire butfor the clear sight of love there will be no horizon for its quietwords no answer nor any place for the art which alone is faithfullyreligious because it is lovely and true</s>           the series of engravings thus completed while they present nocharacters on which the members of the arundel society can justifiablypride themselves have nevertheless a real and effective value ifconsidered as a series of maps of the arena frescoes</s>  few artists ofeminence pass through padua without making studies of detachedportions of the decoration of this chapel while no artist has time tocomplete drawings of the whole</s>  such fragmentary studies might now atany time be engraved with advantage their place in the series beingat once determinable by reference to the woodcuts while qualities ofexpression could often be obtained in engravings of single figureswhich are sure to be lost in an entire subject</s>  the most refinedcharacter is occasionally dependent on a few happy and light toucheswhich in a single head are effective but are too feeble to bear duepart in an entire composition while in the endeavour to reinforcethem their vitality is lost</s>  i believe the members of the arundelsociety will perceive eventually that no copies of works of greatart are worthily representative of them but such as are made freelyand for their own purposes by great painters the best resultsobtainable by mechanical effort will only be charts or plans ofpictures not mirrors of them</s>  such charts it is well to command in asgreat number as possible and with all attainable completeness butthe society cannot be considered as having entered on its truefunctions until it has obtained the hearty cooperation of europeanartists and by the increase of its members the further power ofrepresenting the subtle studies of masterly painters by the aid ofexquisite engraving</s> </s>
