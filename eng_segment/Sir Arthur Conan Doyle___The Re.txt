the man from america</s> it was the sort of window which was common in paris about the end of theseventeenth century</s>  it was high mullioned with a broad transomacross the centre and above the

pallor which was so clear and fresh andcarried with it such a suggestion of purity and innocence that onewould not wish its maiden grace to be marred by an intrusion of colour</s> her features were delicate and sweet and her blueblack hair and longdark eyelashes formed a piquant contrast to her dreamy gray eyes and herivory skin</s>  in her whole expression there was something quiet andsubdued which was accentuated by her simple dress of black taffeta andby the little jet brooch and bracelet which were her sole ornaments</s> such was adele catinat the only daughter of the famous huguenotclothmerchant</s> but if her dress was sombre it was atoned for by the magnificence ofher companion</s>  he was a man who might have been ten years her seniorwith a keen soldier face small

an occasional lurking gleam of mischievoushumour</s>  he was richly clad in plumcoloured velvet with a broad bandof blue silk across his breast and the glittering edge of the order ofst</s>  louis protruding from under it</s>  his companion was a man of fortyswarthy dignified and solemn in a plain but rich dress of black silkwith slashes of gold at the neck and sleeves</s>  as the pair faced theking there was sufficient resemblance between the three faces to showthat they were of one blood and to enable a stranger to guess that theolder was monsieur the younger brother of the king while the other waslouis the dauphin his only legitimate child and heir to a throne towhich in the strange workings of providence neither he nor his sons weredestined to ascend</s> strong as was the likeness between the three faces each with thecurving bourbon nose the large full eye and the thick hapsburgunderlip their common heritage from anne of austria there was still avast difference of temperament and character stamped upon theirfeatures</s>  the king was now in his sixandfortieth year and thecropped black head was already thinning a little on the top and shadingaway to gray over

features were the delight of the sculptor and the painter</s> his firm and yet sensitive mouth and his thick wellarched brows gavean air of authority and power to his face while the more

had poured on the kings hands a few drops of spirits of winecatching them again in a silver dish and the first lord of thebedchamber had presented the bowl of holy water with which he made thesign of

broadsweeping drive lay in front of them dotted with carriages and horsemen</s> on the gravel walks were many gaily dressed ladies who strolled amongthe flowerbeds or watched the fountains with the

green de catinat sprang from his horse and followed at the top ofhis speed in the direction which the young lady had already taken</s> chapter viii</s> the rising sun</s> the rooms which were inhabited by the lady who had already taken somarked a position at the court of france were as humble as were herfortunes at the time when they were allotted to her but with that raretact and selfrestraint which were the leading features in herremarkable character she had made no change in her living with theincrease of her prosperity and forbore from provoking envy and jealousyby any display of wealth or of power</s>  in a side wing of the palace farfrom the central salons and only to be reached by long corridors andstairs were the two or three small chambers upon which the eyes firstof the court then of france and finally of the world were destined tobe turned</s>  in such rooms had the destitute widow of the poet scarronbeen housed when she had first been brought to court by madame demontespan as the governess of the royal children and in such rooms shestill dwelt now that she had added to her maiden francoise daubignythe title of marquise de maintenon with the pension and estate whichthe kings favour had awarded her</s>  here it was that every day the kingwould lounge finding in the conversation of a clever and virtuous womana charm and a pleasure which none of the professed wits of his sparklingcourt had ever been able to give to him and here too the moresagacious of the courtiers were beginning to understand was the pointformerly to be found in the magnificent salons of de montespan whenceflowed those impulses and tendencies which were so eagerly studied andso keenly followed up by all who wished to keep the favour of the king</s> it was a simple creed that of the court</s>  were the king pious then letall turn to their missals and their rosaries</s>  were he rakish then whoso rakish as his devoted followers</s>  but woe to the man who was rakishwhen he should be praying or who pulled a long face when the king worea laughing one</s>  and thus it was that keen eyes were ever fixed uponhim and upon every influence that came near him so that the warycourtier watching the first subtle signs of a coming change might soorder his conduct as to seem to lead rather than to follow</s> the young guardsman had scarce ever exchanged a word with this powerfullady for it was her taste to isolate herself and to appear with thecourt only at the hours of devotion</s>  it was therefore with somefeelings both of nervousness and of curiosity that he followed his guidedown the gorgeous corridors where art and wealth had been strewn withso lavish a hand</s>  the lady paused in front of the chamber door andturned to her companion</s> madame wishes

exquisite from an artists point of viewthe plain but tasteful curtains all left an impression half religiousand half feminine but wholly soothing</s>  indeed the soft light the highwhite statue of the virgin in a canopied niche with a perfumed red lampburning before it and the wooden priedieu with the rededgedprayerbook upon the top of it made the apartment look more like aprivate chapel than a fair ladys boudoir</s> on each side of the empty fireplace was a little greencoveredarmchair the one for madame and the other reserved for the use of theking</s>  a small threelegged stool between them was heaped with herworkbasket and her tapestry</s>  on the chair which was furthest from thedoor with her back turned to the light madame was sitting as the youngofficer entered</s>  it was her favourite position and yet there were fewwomen of her years who had so little reason to fear the sun for ahealthy life and active habits had left her with a clear skin anddelicate bloom which any young beauty of the court might have envied</s> her figure was graceful and queenly her gestures and pose full of anatural dignity and her voice as he had already remarked most sweetand melodious</s>  her face was handsome rather than beautiful set in astatuesque classical mould with broad white forehead firm delicatelysensitive mouth and a pair of large serene gray eyes earnest andplacid in repose but capable of reflecting the whole play of her soulfrom the merry gleam of humour to the quick flash of righteous anger</s> an elevating serenity was however the leading expression of herfeatures and in that she presented the strongest contrast to her rivalwhose beautiful face was ever swept by the emotion of the moment andwho gleamed one hour and shadowed over the next like a cornfield in thewind</s>  in wit and quickness of tongue it is true that de montespan hadthe advantage but the strong commonsense and the deeper nature of theelder woman might prove in the end to be the better weapon</s>  de catinatat the moment without having time to notice details was simplyconscious that he was in the presence of a very handsome woman and thather large pensive eyes were fixed critically

and to turn from the blessed work ofconverting the heathen to the even more precious task of nursing backhealth and strength into those of gods warriors who have been struckdown in the fight with satan</s> it was strange to de catinat who knew well the sordid and dreadfulexistence led by these same sisters threatened ever with miseryhunger and the scalpingknife to hear this lady at whose feet lay allthe good things of this earth speaking enviously of their lot</s> they are very good women said he shortly remembering mademoisellenanons warning and fearing to trench upon the dangerous

priedieu sunk her facein her hands for some few minutes during which the object of herdevotions stood in some perplexity in the middle of the room hardlyknowing whether such an attention should be

waited at some distancewhile these incidents were being enacted</s>  three of the horsemen rodeahead the coachman was curtly ordered to follow them and de vivonnehaving despatched one of the band with a note to his sister followedafter the coach with the remainder of his desperadoes</s> the unfortunate guardsman had now entirely recovered his senses andfound himself with a strap round his ankles and another round hiswrists a captive inside a moving prison which lumbered heavily alongthe country road</s>  he had been stunned by the shock of his fall and hisleg was badly bruised by the weight of his horse but the cut on hisforehead was a mere trifle and the bleeding had already ceased</s> his mind however pained him more than his body</s>  he sank his head intohis pinioned hands and stamped madly with his feet rocking himself toand fro in his despair</s>  what a fool a treble fool he had been</s> he an old soldier who had seen something of war to walk with openeyes into such a trap</s>  the king had chosen him of all men as a trustymessenger and yet he had failed himand failed him so ignominiouslywithout shot fired or sword drawn</s>  he was warned too warned by ayoung man who knew nothing of court intrigue and who was guided only bythe wits which nature had given him</s>  de catinat dashed himself downupon the leather cushion in the agony of his thoughts</s> but then came a return of that commonsense which lies so very closelybeneath the impetuosity of the celt</s>  the matter was done now and hemust see if it could not be mended</s>  amos green had escaped</s>  that wasone grand point in his favour</s>  and amos green had heard the kingsmessage and realised its importance</s>  it was true that he knew nothingof paris but surely a man who could pick his way at night through theforests of maine would not be baulked in finding so wellknown a houseas that of the archbishop of paris</s>  but then there came a suddenthought which turned de catinats heart to lead</s>  the city gates werelocked at eight oclock in the evening</s>  it was now nearly nine</s>  itwould have been easy for him whose uniform was a voucher for hismessage to gain his way through</s>  but how could amos green a foreignerand a civilian hope to pass</s>  it was impossible clearly impossible</s> and yet somehow in spite of the impossibility he still clung to avague hope that a man so full of energy and resource might find some wayout of the difficulty</s> and then the thought of escape occurred to his mind</s>  might he not evennow be in time perhaps to carry his own message</s>  who were these menwho had seized him</s>  they had said nothing to give him a hint as towhose tools they were</s>  monsieur and the dauphin occurred to his mind</s> probably one or the other</s>  he had only recognised one of them oldmajor despard a man who frequented the low wineshops of versaillesand whose sword was ever at the disposal of the longest purse</s> and where were these people taking him to</s>  it might be to his death</s> but if they wished to do away with him why should they have brought himback to consciousness</s>  and why this carriage and drive</s>  full ofcuriosity he peered out of the windows</s> a horseman was riding close up on either side but there was glass infront of the carriage and through this he could gain some idea as tohis whereabouts</s>  the clouds had cleared now and the moon was shiningbrightly bathing the whole wide landscape in its shimmering light</s> to the right lay the open country broad plains with clumps of woodlandand the towers of castles pricking out from above the groves</s>  a heavybell was ringing in some monastery and its dull booming came and wentwith the breeze</s>  on the left but far away lay the glimmer of paris</s> they were leaving it rapidly behind</s>  whatever his destination it wasneither the capital nor versailles</s>  then he began to count the chancesof escape</s>  his sword had been removed and his pistols were still in theholsters beside his unfortunate horse</s>  he was unarmed then even if hecould free himself and his captors were at least a dozen in number</s> there were three on ahead riding abreast along the white moonlit road</s> then there was one on each side and he should judge by the clatter ofhoofs that there could not be fewer than half a dozen behind</s>  that wouldmake exactly twelve including the coachman too many surely for anunarmed man to hope to baffle</s>  at the thought of the coachman he hadglanced through the glass front at the broad back of the man and he hadsuddenly in the glimmer of the carriage lamp observed something whichstruck him with horror</s> the man was evidently desperately wounded</s>  it was strange indeed thathe could still sit there and flick his whip with so terrible an injury</s> in the back of his great red coat just under the left shoulderbladewas a gash in the cloth where some weapon had passed and all round wasa wide patch of dark scarlet which told its own tale</s>  nor was this all</s> as he raised his whip the moonlight shone upon his hand and de catinatsaw with a shudder that it also was splashed and clogged with blood</s> the guardsman craned his neck to catch a glimpse of the mans face buthis broadbrimmed hat was drawn low and the high collar of hisdrivingcoat was raised so that his features were in the shadow</s> this silent man in front of him with the horrible marks upon hisperson sent a chill to de catinats valiant heart and he muttered overone of marots huguenot psalms for who but the foul fiend himself woulddrive a coach with those crimsoned hands and with a sword driven throughhis body</s> and now they had come to a spot where the main road ran onwards but asmaller side track wound away down the steep slope of a hill and so inthe direction of the seine</s>  the advanceguard had kept to the mainroad and the two horsemen on either side were trotting in the samedirection when to de catinats amazement the carriage suddenlyswerved to one side and in an instant plunged down the steep inclinethe two stout horses galloping at their topmost speed the coachmanstanding up and lashing furiously at them and the clumsy old vehiclebounding along in a way which threw him backwards and forwards from oneseat to the other</s>  behind him he could hear a shout of consternationfrom the escort and then the rush of galloping hoofs</s>  away they flewthe roadside poplars dancing past at either window the horsesthundering along with their stomachs to the earth and that demon driverstill waving those horrible red hands in the moonlight and screaming outto the maddened steeds</s>  sometimes the carriage jolted one waysometimes another swaying furiously and running on two side wheels asthough it must every instant go over</s>  and yet fast as they went theirpursuers went faster still</s>  the rattle of their hoofs was at their verybacks and suddenly at one of the windows there came into view the reddistended nostrils of a horse</s>  slowly it drew forward the muzzle theeye the ears the mane coming into sight as the rider still gainedupon them and then above them the fierce face of despard and the gleamof a brass pistol barrel</s> at the horse despard at the horse</s>  cried an authoritative voice frombehind</s> the pistol flashed and the coach lurched over as one of the horses gavea convulsive spring</s>  but the driver still shrieked and lashed with hiswhip while the carriage bounded onwards</s> but now the road turned a sudden curve and there right in front ofthem not a hundred paces away was the seine running cold and still inthe moonshine</s>  the bank on either side of the highway ran straight downwithout any break to the waters edge</s>  there was no sign of a bridgeand a black shadow in the centre of the stream showed where theferryboat was returning after conveying some belated travellers across</s> the driver never hesitated but gathering up the reins he urged thefrightened creatures into the river</s>  they hesitated however when theyfirst felt the cold water about their hocks and even as they did so oneof them with a low moan fell over upon her side</s>  despards bullet hadfound its mark</s>  like a flash the coachman hurled himself from the boxand plunged into the stream but the pursuing horsemen were all roundhim before this and halfadozen hands had seized him ere he couldreach deep water and had dragged him to the bank</s>  his broad hat hadbeen struck off in the struggle and de catinat saw his face in themoonshine</s>  great heavens</s>  it was amos green</s> chapter xvii</s> the dungeon of portillac</s> the desperadoes were as much astonished as was de catinat when theyfound that they had recaptured in this extraordinary manner themessenger whom they had given up for lost</s>  a volley of oaths andexclamations broke from them as on tearing off the huge red coat ofthe coachman they disclosed the sombre dress of the young american</s> a thousand thunders</s>  cried one</s>  and this is the man whom thatdevils brat latour would make out to be dead</s> and how came he here</s> and where is etienne arnaud</s> he has stabbed etienne</s>  see the great cut in the coat</s> ay and see the colour of his hand</s>  he has stabbed him and taken hiscoat and hat</s> what</s>  while we were all within stones cast</s> ay there is no other way out of it</s> by my soul</s>  cried old despard i had never much love for old etiennebut i have emptied a cup of wine with him before now and i shall seethat he has justice</s>  let us cast these reins round the fellows neckand hang him upon this tree</s> several pairs of hands were already unbuckling the harness of the deadhorse when de vivonne pushed his way into the little group and with afew curt words checked their intended violence</s> it is as much as your lives are worth to touch him said he</s> but he has slain etienne arnaud</s> that score may be settled afterwards</s>  tonight he is the kingsmessenger</s>  is the other all safe</s> yes he is here</s> tie this man and put him in beside him</s>  unbuckle the traces of thedead horse</s>  so</s>  now de carnac put your own into the harness</s> you can mount the box and drive for we have not very far to go</s> the changes were rapidly made amos green was thrust in beside decatinat and the carriage was soon toiling up the steep incline which ithad come down so precipitately</s>  the american had said not a word sincehis capture and had remained absolutely stolid with his hands crossedover his chest whilst his fate was under discussion</s>  now that he wasalone once more with his comrade however he frowned and muttered likea man who feels that fortune has used him badly</s> those infernal horses</s>  he grumbled</s>  why an american horse wouldhave taken to the water like a duck</s>  many a time have i swum my oldstallion sagamore across the hudson</s>  once over the river we shouldhave had a clear lead to paris</s> my dear friend cried de catinat laying his manacled hands upon thoseof his comrade can you forgive me for speaking as i did upon the wayfrom versailles</s> tut man</s>  i never gave it a thought</s> you were right a thousand times and i was as you said a foolablind obstinate fool</s>  how nobly you have stood by me</s>  but how cameyou there</s>  never in my life have i been so astonished as when i sawyour face</s> amos green chuckled to himself</s>  i thought that maybe it would be asurprise to you if you knew who was driving you said he</s>  when i wasthrown from my horse i lay quiet partly because i wanted to get a gripof my breath and partly because it seemed to me to be more healthy tolie than to stand with all those swords clinking in my ears</s>  then theyall got round you and i rolled into the ditch crept along it got onthe crossroad in the shadow of the trees and was beside the carriagebefore ever they knew that i was gone</s>  i saw in a flash that there wasonly one way by which i could be of use to you</s>  the coachman wasleaning round with his head turned to see what was going on behind him</s> i out with my knife sprang up on the front wheel and stopped histongue forever</s> what</s>  without a sound</s> i have not lived among the indians for nothing</s> and then</s> i pulled him down into the ditch and i got into his coat and his hat</s> i did not scalp him</s> scalp him</s>  great heavens</s>  such things are only done among savages</s> ah</s>  i thought that maybe it was not the custom of the country</s>  i amglad now that i did not do it</s>  i had hardly got the reins before theywere all back and bundled you into the coach</s>  i was not afraid of theirseeing me but i was scared lest i should not know which road to takeand so set them on the trail</s>  but they made it easy to me by sendingsome of their riders in front so i did well until i saw that bytrackand made a run for it</s>  wed have got away too if that rogue hadntshot the horse and if the beasts had faced the water</s> the guardsman again pressed his comrades hands</s>  you have been as trueto me as hilt to blade said he</s>  it was a bold thought and a bolddeed</s> and what now</s>  asked the american</s> i do not know who these men are and i do not know whither they aretaking us</s> to their villages likely to burn us</s> de catinat laughed in spite of his anxiety</s>  you will have it that weare back in america again said he</s>  they dont do things in that wayin france</s> they seem free enough with hanging in france</s>  i tell you i felt likea smokedout coon when that trace was round my neck</s> i fancy that they are taking us to some place where they can shut us upuntil this business blows over</s> well theyll need to be smart about it</s> why</s> else maybe they wont find us when they want us</s> what do you mean</s> for answer the american with a twist and a wriggle drew his two handsapart and held them in front of his comrades face</s> bless you it is the first thing they teach the papooses in an indianwigwam</s>  ive got out of a hurons thongs of raw hide before now and itaint very likely that a stiff stirrup leather will hold me</s>  put yourhands out</s>  with a few dexterous twists he loosened de catinats bondsuntil he also was able to slip his hands free</s>  now for your feet ifyoull put them up</s>  theyll find that we are easier to catch than tohold</s> but at that moment the carriage began to slow down and the clank of thehoofs of the riders in front of them died suddenly away</s>  peepingthrough the windows the prisoners saw a huge dark building stretchingin front of them so high and so broad that the night shrouded it inupon every side</s>  a great archway hung above them and the lamps shoneon the rude wooden gate studded with ponderous clamps and nails</s>  inthe upper part of the door was a small square iron grating and throughthis they could catch a glimpse of the gleam of a lantern and of abearded face which looked out at them</s>  de vivonne standing in hisstirrups craned his neck up towards the grating so that the two menmost interested could hear little of the conversation which followed</s> they saw only that the horseman held a gold ring up in the air and thatthe face above which had begun by shaking and frowning was now noddingand smiling</s>  an instant later the head disappeared the door swung openupon screaming hinges and the carriage drove on into the courtyardbeyond leaving the escort with the exception of de vivonne outside</s> as the horses pulled up a knot of rough fellows clustered round andthe two prisoners were dragged roughly out</s>  in the light of the torcheswhich flared around them they could see that they were hemmed in by highturreted walls upon every side</s>  a bulky man with a bearded face thesame whom they had seen at the grating was standing in the centre ofthe group of armed men issuing his orders</s> to the upper dungeon simon</s>  he cried</s>  and see that they have twobundles of straw and a loaf of bread until we learn our masters will</s> i know not who your master may be said de catinat but i would askyou by what warrant he dares to stop two messengers of the king whiletravelling in his service</s> by st</s>  denis if my master play the king a trick it will be but tieand tie the stout man answered with a grin</s>  but no more talk</s> away with them simon and you answer to me for their safekeeping</s> it was in vain that de catinat raved and threatened invoking the mostterrible menaces upon all who were concerned in detaining him</s>  twostout knaves thrusting him from behind and one dragging in front forcedhim through a narrow gate and along a stoneflagged passage a small manin black buckram with a bunch of keys in one hand and a swinging lanternin the other leading the way</s>  their ankles had been so tied that theycould but take steps of a foot in length</s>  shuffling along they madetheir way down three successive corridors and through three doors eachof which was locked and barred behind them</s>  then they ascended awinding stone stair hollowed out in the centre by the feet ofgenerations of prisoners and of jailers and finally they were thrustinto a small square dungeon and two trusses of straw were thrown inafter them</s>  an instant later a heavy key turned in the lock and theywere left to their own meditations</s> very grim and dark those meditations were in the case of de catinat</s> a stroke of good luck had made him at court and now this other of illfortune had destroyed him</s>  it would be in vain that he should plead hisown powerlessness</s>  he knew his royal master well</s>  he was a man who wasmunificent when his orders were obeyed and inexorable when theymiscarried</s>  no excuse availed with him</s>  an unlucky man was asabhorrent to him as a negligent one</s>  in this great crisis the king hadtrusted him with an allimportant message and that message had not beendelivered</s>  what could save him now from disgrace and from ruin</s> he cared nothing for the dim dungeon in which he found himself nor forthe uncertain fate which hung over his head but his heart turned tolead when he thought of his blasted career and of the triumph of thosewhose jealousy had been aroused by his rapid promotion</s>  there were hispeople in paris toohis sweet adele his old uncle who had been asgood as a father to him</s>  what protector would they have in theirtroubles now that he had lost the power that might have shielded them</s> how long would it be before they were exposed once more to thebrutalities of dalbert and his dragoons</s>  he clenched his teeth at thethought and threw himself down with a groan upon the litter of strawdimly visible in the faint light which streamed through the singlewindow</s> but his energetic comrade had yielded to no feeling of despondency</s> the instant that the clang of the prison door had assured him that hewas safe from interruption he had slipped off the bonds which held himand had felt all round the walls and flooring to see what manner ofplace this might be</s>  his search had ended in the discovery of a smallfireplace at one corner and of two great clumsy billets of wood whichseemed to have been left there to serve as pillows for the prisoners</s> having satisfied himself that the chimney was so small that it wasutterly impossible to pass even his head up it he drew the two blocksof wood over to the window and was able by placing one above the otherand standing on tiptoe on the highest to reach the bars which guardedit</s>  drawing himself up and fixing one toe in an inequality of thewall he managed to look out on to the courtyard which they had justquitted</s>  the carriage and de vivonne were passing out through the gateas he looked and he heard a moment later the slam of the heavy door andthe clatter of hoofs from the troop of horsemen outside</s>  the seneschaland his retainers had disappeared the torches too were gone andsave for the measured tread of a pair of sentinels in the yard twentyfeet beneath him all was silent throughout the great castle</s> and a very great castle it was</s>  even as he hung there with straininghands his eyes were running in admiration and amazement

unlikely moments</s>  heremembered suddenly a bright summer day over the water when first he hadcome down from albany and how his father had met him on the wharf bythe hudson and had taken him through

together would not make one wing ofthis huge pile which was itself a mere dogkennel beside the mightypalace at versailles</s>  he would that his father were here now andthen on second thoughts he would not for it came back to him that hewas a prisoner in a far land and that his sightseeing was being donethrough the bars of a dungeon window</s> the window was large enough to pass his body through if it were not forthose bars</s>  he shook them and hung his weight upon them but they wereas thick as his thumb and firmly welded</s>  then getting some strong holdfor his other foot he supported himself by one hand while he pickedwith his knife at the setting of the iron</s>  it was cement as smooth asglass and as hard as marble</s>  his knife turned when he tried to loosenit</s>  but there was still the stone</s>  it was sandstone not so very hard</s> if he could cut grooves in it he might be able to draw out barscement and all</s>  he sprang down to the floor again and was

rest</s> the two comrades did not dare to do any work during the day for fearthey should be surprised by the jailer or observed from without</s> no one came near them but they ate their loaves and drank their waterwith the appetite of men who had often known what it was to be withouteven such simple food as that</s>  the instant that night fell they wereboth up upon the pegs grinding away at the hard stone and tugging atthe bars</s>  it was a rainy night and there was a sharp thunderstormbut they could see very well while the shadow of the arched windowprevented their being seen</s>  before midnight they had loosened one barand the other was just beginning to give when some slight noise madethem turn their heads and there was their jailer standing openmouthedin the middle of the

corridor which led to their cell</s> well ill have that bar out after all said the american at lastrising and stepping over to the window</s>  anyhow well see what allthis caterwauling is about</s>  he climbed up on his pegs as he spoke andpeeped out</s> come up</s>  he cried excitedly to his comrade</s>  theyve got some othergame going on here and they are all a deal too busy to bother theirheads about us</s> de catinat clambered up beside him and the two stood staring down intothe courtyard</s>  a brazier had been lit at each corner and the place wasthronged with men many of whom carried torches</s>  the yellow glareplayed fitfully over the grim gray walls flickering up sometimes untilthe highest turrets shone golden against the black sky and then as thewind caught them dying away until they scarce threw a glow upon thecheek of their bearer</s>  the main gate was open and a carriage whichhad apparently just driven in was standing at a small door immediatelyin front of their window</s>  the wheels and sides were brown with mud andthe two horses were reeking and heavyheaded as though their journeyhad been both swift and long</s>  a man wearing a plumed hat and envelopedin a ridingcoat had stepped from the carriage and then turning roundhad dragged a second person out after him</s>  there was a scuffle a crya push and the two figures had vanished through the door</s>  as itclosed the carriage drove away the torches and braziers wereextinguished the main gate was closed once more and all was as quietas before this sudden interruption</s> well</s>  gasped de catinat</s>  is this another kings messenger theyvegot</s> there will be lodgings for two more here in a short time said amosgreen</s>  if they only leave us alone this cell wont hold us long</s> i wonder where that jailer has gone</s> he may go where he likes as long as he keeps away from here</s>  give meyour bar again</s>  this thing is giving</s>  it wont take us long to have itout</s>  he set to work furiously trying to deepen the groove in thestone through which he hoped to drag the staple</s>  suddenly he ceasedand strained his ears</s> by thunder</s>  said he theres some one working on the other side</s> they both stood listening</s>  there were the thud of hammers the raspingof a saw and the clatter of wood from the other side of the wall</s> what can they be doing</s> i cant think</s> can you see them</s> they are too near the wall</s> i think i can manage said de catinat</s>  i am slighter than you</s>  hepushed his head and neck and half of one shoulder through the gapbetween the bars and there he remained until his friend thought thatperhaps he had stuck and pulled at his legs to extricate him</s> he writhed back however without any difficulty</s> they are building something he whispered</s> building</s> yes there are four of them with a lantern</s> what can they be building then</s> its a shed i think</s>  i can see four sockets in the ground and theyare fixing four uprights into them</s> well we cant get away as long as there are four men just under ourwindow</s> impossible</s> but we may as well finish our work for all that</s>  the gentlescrapings of his iron were drowned amid the noise which swelled everlouder from without</s>  the bar loosened at the end and he drew it slowlytowards him</s>  at that instant however just as he was disengaging it around head appeared between him and the moonlight a head with a greatshock of tangled hair and a woollen cap upon the top of it</s> so astonished was amos green at the sudden

went forward</s>  the head stillpassed and repassed its owner walking apparently upon some platformwhich they had constructed beneath their window but never giving aglance or a thought to the black square opening beside him</s>  it wasearly morning and the first cold light was beginning to steal over thecourtyard before the work was at last finished and the workmen hadleft</s>  then at last the prisoners dared to climb up and to see what itwas which had been constructed during the night</s>  it gave them a catchof the breath as they looked at it</s>  it was a scaffold</s> there it lay the illomened platform of dark greasy boards newlyfastened together but evidently used often before for the same purpose</s> it was buttressed up against their wall and extended a clear twentyfeet out with a broad wooden stair leading down from the further side</s> in the centre stood a headsmans block all haggled at the top andsmeared with rustcoloured stains</s> i think it is time that we left

 now what in thename of heaven is this</s> as he spoke the door which faced them opened and a singular processionfiled out</s>  first came two dozen footmen walking in pairs all carryinghalberds and clad in the same marooncoloured liveries</s>  after them ahuge bearded man with his tunic off and the sleeves of his coarseshirt rolled up over his elbows strode along with a great axe over hisleft shoulder</s>  behind him a priest with an open missal pattered forthprayers and in his shadow was a woman clad in black her neck baredand a black shawl cast over her head and drooping in front of her bowedface</s>  within grip of her walked a tall thin fiercefaced man withharsh red features and a great jutting nose</s>  he wore a flat velvet capwith a single eagle feather fastened into it by a diamond clasp whichgleamed in the morning light</s>  but bright as was his gem his dark eyeswere brighter still and sparkled from under his bushy brows with a madbrilliancy which bore with it something of menace and of terror</s> his limbs jerked as he walked his features twisted and he carriedhimself like a man who strives hard to hold himself in when his wholesoul is aflame with exultation</s>  behind him again twelve moremaroonclad retainers brought up the rear of this singular procession</s> the woman had faltered at the foot of the scaffold but the man behindher had thrust her forward with such force that she stumbled over thelower step and would have fallen had she not clutched at the arm of thepriest</s>  at the top of the ladder her eyes met the dreadful block andshe burst into a scream and shrunk backwards</s>  but again the man thrusther on and two of the followers caught her by either wrist and draggedher forwards</s> oh maurice</s>  maurice</s>  she screamed</s>  i am not fit to die</s> oh forgive me maurice as you hope for forgiveness yourself</s>  maurice</s> maurice</s>  she strove to get towards him to clutch at his wrist at hissleeve but he

cried</s> he had come with every intention of beginning the interview by tellingher bluntly of his marriage but now as he looked upon her beauty andher love he felt that it would have been less brutal

naturalenough</s>  but when ten minutes passed by and he had neither moved norspoken she peered at him through the gloom with some curiosity</s>  in theglance which she had of him as he handed her in

grip of steel closedsuddenly round her wrist and forced her back into her seat</s>  and yet themans body had not moved and there was no sound save the lurching andrasping of the carriage and the

face in her hands</s>  once more she prayed god toforgive her for her poor sinful life</s>  so they whirled through the nightbehind the clattering horses the husband and the wife saying nothingbut with hatred and fear raging in their hearts until a brazier fireshone down upon them from the angle of a keep and the shadow of thehuge pile loomed vaguely up in front of them in the darkness</s>  it wasthe castle of portillac</s> chapter xxii</s> the scaffold of portillac</s> and thus it was that amory de catinat and amos green saw from theirdungeon window the midnight carriage which discharged its prisonerbefore their eyes</s>  hence too came that ominous planking and thatstrange procession in the early morning</s>  and thus it also happened thatthey found themselves looking down upon francoise de montespan as shewas led to her death and that they heard that last piteous cry for aidat the instant when the heavy hand of the ruffian with the axe fell uponher shoulder and she was forced down upon her knees beside the block</s> she shrank screaming from the dreadful redstained greasy billet ofwood but the butcher heaved up his weapon and the seigneur had taken astep forward

suddenly shotheadforemost pitching on to his outstretched hands and then boundingto his feet</s>  within a foot of his heels came the head of a second onewho fell more heavily than the first and yet recovered himself asquickly</s>  the one wore the blue coat with silver facings of the kingsguard the second had the dark coat and cleanshaven face of a man ofpeace but each carried a short rusty iron

thud with a crackle like a breaking egg andthe bar flew into pieces</s>  the headsman gave a dreadful cry anddropped his axe clapped his two hands to his head and running zigzagacross the scaffold fell over a dead man into the courtyard beneath</s> quick as a flash de catinat had caught up the axe and faced demontespan with the heavy weapon slung over his shoulder and a challengein his eyes</s>

howeverto suggest that the voyage might restore the merchants health whenadele gave a cry of surprise and pointed out over the port quarter</s> so beautiful was she at the instant with her raven hair

catch these foamcrests from time to time andthen there would be a sharp spatter upon the decks with a salt smackupon the lips and a pringling in the eyes</s>  suddenly as he gazedhowever something

grimmer</s>  its a mans foot saidhe</s>  i think that you had best take the gal below to the cabin</s> amid a solemn hush they ran alongside this lonely craft which hung outso sinister a signal</s>  within ten yards of her the foreyard was hauledaback and they gazed down upon her terrible crew</s> she was a little thirteenfoot cockleshell very broad for her lengthand so flat in the bottom that she had been meant evidently for river orlake work</s>  huddled together beneath the seats were three folk a man inthe dress of a respectable artisan a woman of the same class and alittle child about a year old</s>  the boat was half full of water and thewoman and child were stretched with their faces downwards the faircurls of the infant and the dark locks of the mother washing to and frolike waterweeds upon the surface</s>  the man lay with a slatecolouredface his chin cocking up towards the sky his eyes turned upwards tothe whites and his mouth wide open showing a leathern crinkled tonguelike a rotting leaf</s>  in the bows all huddled in a heap and with asingle paddle still grasped in his hand there crouched a very small manclad in black an open book lying across his face and one stiff legjutting upwards with the heel of the foot resting between the rowlocks</s> so this strange company swooped and tossed upon the long green atlanticrollers</s> a boat had been lowered by the golden rod and the unfortunates weresoon conveyed upon deck</s>  no particle of either food or drink was to befound nor anything save the single paddle and the open bible which layacross the small mans face</s>  man woman and child had all been dead aday at the least and so with the short prayers used upon the seas theywere buried from the vessels side</s>  the small man had at first seemedalso to be lifeless but amos had detected some slight flutter of hisheart and the faintest haze was left upon the watch glass which washeld before his mouth</s>  wrapped in a dry blanket he was laid beside

jefferson bringtwo oars aft</s>  its a long pull with the wind in your teeth but youllbe there by tomorrow night and the weather is set fair</s> the two frenchmen were soon provided with all that they were likely torequire and pushed off with a waving of hats and a shouting of bonvoyage</s>  the foreyard was swung round again and the golden rod turnedher bowsprit for the west</s>  for hours a glimpse could be caught of theboat dwindling away on the wavetops until at last it vanished intothe haze and with it vanished the very last link which connected themwith the great world which they were leaving behind them</s> but whilst these things had been done the senseless man beneath themast had twitched his eyelids had drawn a little gasping breath andthen finally had opened his eyes</s>  his skin was like gray parchmentdrawn tightly over his bones and the limbs which thrust out from hisclothes were those of a sickly child</s>  yet weak as he was the largeblack eyes with which he looked about him were full of dignity andpower</s>  old catinat had come upon deck and at the sight of the man andof his dress he had run forward and had raised his head reverently andrested it in his

notcome this journey with you said he for the lord has called me upona further journey of my own</s>  i have had my summons and i am ready</s> i am indeed the pastor of the temple at isigny and when we heard theorders of the wicked king i and two of the faithful with their littleone put forth in the hope that we might come to england</s>  but on thefirst day there came a wave which swept away one of our oars and allthat was in the boat our bread our keg and we were left with no hopesave in him</s>  and then he began to call us to him one at a time firstthe child and then the woman and then the man until i only am leftthough i feel that my own time is not long</s>  but since ye are also ofthe faithful may i not serve you in any way before i go</s> the merchant shook his head and then suddenly a thought flashed uponhim and he ran with joy upon his face and whispered eagerly to amosgreen</s>  amos laughed and strode across to the captain</s> its time said ephraim savage grimly</s> then the whisperers went to de catinat</s>  he sprang in the air and hiseyes shone with delight</s>  and then they went down to adele in her cabinand she started and blushed and turned her sweet face away and pattedher hair with her hands as woman will when a sudden call is made uponher</s>  and so since haste was needful and since even there upon thelonely sea there was one coming who might at any moment snap theirpurpose they found themselves in a few minutes this gallant man andthis pure woman kneeling hand in hand before the dying pastor whoraised his thin arm feebly in benediction as he muttered the words whichshould make them forever one</s> adele had often pictured her wedding to herself as what young girl hasnot</s>  often in her dreams she had knelt before the altar with amory inthe temple of the rue st</s>  martin</s>  or sometimes her fancy had taken herto some of those smaller churches in the provinces those little refugeswhere a handful of believers gathered together

their only choristers the gullswhich screamed around them and their wedding hymn the worldold anthemwhich is struck from the waves by the wind</s>  and when could she forgetthe scene</s>  the yellow masts and the bellying sails the gray drawn faceand the cracked lips of the castaway her fathers gaunt earnestfeatures as he knelt to support the dying minister de catinat in hisblue coat already faded and weatherstained</s>  captain savage with hiswooden face turned towards the clouds and amos green with his hands inhis pockets and a quiet twinkle in his blue eyes</s>  then behind all thelanky mate and the little group of new england seamen with theirpalmetto hats and their serious faces</s> and so it was done amid kindly words in a harsh foreign tongue and theshaking of rude hands hardened by the rope and the oar</s>  de catinat andhis wife leaned together by the shrouds when all was over and watchedthe black side as it rose and fell and the green water which raced pastthem</s> it is all so strange and so new she said</s>  our future seems as vagueand dark as yonder cloudbanks which gather in front of us</s> if it rest with me he answered your future will be as merry

is only one way for it</s>  we must make the richelieu riverand keep right along to lake champlain and lake st</s>  sacrament</s>  there weshould be close by the headwaters of the hudson</s> it is a

for us if hecan</s> and so for a long week the little party toiled up the great waterwaykeeping ever to the southern bank where there were fewer clearings</s> on both sides of the stream the woods were thick but every here andthere they would curve away and a narrow strip of cultivated land wouldskirt the bank with the yellow stubble to mark where the wheat hadgrown</s>  adele looked with interest at the wooden houses with theirjutting stories and quaint gableends at the solid stonebuiltmanorhouses of the seigneurs and at the mills in every hamlet whichserved the double purpose of grinding flour and of a loopholed place ofretreat in case of attack</s>  horrible experience had taught the canadianswhat the english settlers had yet to learn that in a land of savages itis a folly

supplied themselves with good guns and plenty ofammunition from the dutch and english of new york</s>  the long thin lineof french settlements lay naked before them</s>  they were gathered in thewoods like hounds in leash waiting for the orders of their chiefswhich should precipitate them with torch and with tomahawk upon the beltof villages</s> such was the situation as the little party of refugees paddled along thebank of the river seeking the only path which could lead them to peaceand to freedom</s>  yet it was as they well knew a dangerous road tofollow</s>  all down the richelieu river were the outposts and blockhousesof the french for when the feudal system was grafted upon canada thevarious seigneurs or native noblesse were assigned their estates inthe positions which would be of most benefit to the settlement</s>  eachseigneur with his tenants under him trained as they were in the use ofarms formed a military force exactly as they had done in the middleages the farmer

richelieu which runs at right angles to the st</s>  lawrencetowards the mohawk country</s>  the blockhouses themselves might hold theirown but to the little party who had to travel down from one to theother the situation was full of deadly peril</s>  it was true that theiroquois were not at war with the english but they would discriminatelittle when on the warpath and the americans even had they wished todo so could not separate their fate from that of their two frenchcompanions</s> as they ascended the st</s>  lawrence they met many canoes coming down</s> sometimes it was an officer or an official on his way to the capitalfrom three rivers or montreal sometimes it was a load of skins withindians or coureursdebois conveying them down to be shipped toeurope and sometimes it was a small canoe which bore a sunburnedgrizzlyhaired man with rusty weatherstained black cassock whozigzagged from bank to bank stopping at every indian hut upon his way</s> if aught were amiss with the church in canada the fault lay not with menlike these village priests who toiled and worked and spent their verylives in bearing comfort and hope and a little touch of refinement toothrough all those wilds</s>  more than once these wayfarers wished to havespeech with the fugitives but they pushed onwards disregarding theirsigns and hails</s>  from below nothing overtook them for they paddledfrom early morning until late at night drawing up the canoe when theyhalted and building a fire of dry wood for already the nip of thecoming winter was in the air</s> it was not only the people and their dwellings which were stretched outbefore the wondering eyes of the french girl as she sat day after day inthe stern of the canoe</s>  her husband and amos green taught her also totake notice of the sights of the woodlands and as they skirted thebank they pointed out a thousand things which her own senses wouldnever have discerned</s>  sometimes it was the furry face of a raccoonpeeping out from some treecleft or an otter swimming under theoverhanging brushwood with the gleam of a white fish in its mouth</s> or perhaps it was the wild cat crouching along a branch with itswicked yellow eyes fixed upon the squirrels which played at the fartherend or else with a scuttle and rush the canadian porcupine would thrustits way among the yellow blossoms of the resin weed and the tangle ofthe whortleberry bushes</s>  she learned too to recognise the pert sharpcry of the tiny chickadee the call of the bluebird and the flash ofits wings amid the foliage the sweet chirpy note of the black and

in her but her presenceweighed him down with fear for he knew that while nature had made thesewoods a heaven man had changed it into a hell and that a namelesshorror lurked behind all the beauty of the fading leaves and of thewoodland flowers</s>  often as he lay at night beside the smouldering fireupon his couch of spruce and looked at the little figure muffled in theblanket and slumbering peacefully by his side he felt that he had noright to expose her to such peril and that in the morning they shouldturn the canoe eastward again and take what fate might bring them atquebec</s>  but ever with the daybreak there came the thought of thehumiliation the dreary homeward voyage the separation which wouldawait them in galley and dungeon to turn him from his purpose</s> on the seventh day they rested at a point but a few miles from the mouthof the richelieu river where a large blockhouse fort richelieu hadbeen built by m</s>  de saurel</s>  once past this they had no great distanceto go to reach the seigneury of de catinats friend of the noblessewho would help them upon their way</s>  they had spent the night upon alittle island in midstream and at early dawn they were about to thrustthe canoe out again from the sandlined cove in which she lay whenephraim savage growled in his throat and pointed out across the water</s> a large canoe was coming up the river flying along as quick as a dozenarms could drive it</s>  in the stern sat a dark figure which bent forwardwith every swing of the paddles as though consumed by eagerness to pushonwards</s>  even at that distance there was no mistaking it</s>  it was thefanatical monk whom they had left behind them</s> concealed among the brushwood they watched their pursuers fly past andvanish round a curve in the

other side and had landed at theedge of the forest</s>  there the guns and ammunition were allotted to eachman and his share of the provisions and of the scanty baggage</s>  thenhaving paid the indians and having instructed them to say nothing oftheir movements they turned their backs upon the river and plunged intothe silent woods</s> chapter xxxi</s> the hairless man</s> all day they pushed on through the woodlands walking in single fileamos green first then the seaman then the lady and de catinatbringing up the rear</s>  the young woodsman advanced cautiously seeingand hearing

greensward beneath their feet made beautiful by the white euphorbia thegolden rod and the purple aster</s>  sometimes however the great trunksclosed in upon them and they had to grope their way in a dim twilightor push a path through the tangled brushwood of green sassafras orscarlet sumach</s>  and then again the woods would shred suddenly away infront of them and they would skirt marshes overgrown with wild riceand dotted with little dark clumps of alder bushes or make their waypast silent woodland lakes all streaked and barred with the treeshadows which threw their crimsons and clarets and bronzes upon thefringe of the deep blue sheet of water</s>  there were streams too someclear and rippling where the trout flashed and the kingfisher gleamedothers dark and poisonous from

be a thousand times worsefor you</s> and why</s> because we have fought the indians from the first and we have themalways in our mind when we build</s>  you see how along this river everyhouse and every hamlet supports its neighbour</s>  but you by saint anneof beaupre it made my scalp tingle when i came on your frontiers andsaw the lonely farmhouses and little clearings out in the woods with

toconquer</s> your people have a way of conquering although they say that they do notwish to do it remarked du lhut</s>  now with us we bang our drums andwave our flags and make a stir but no very big

quebec</s>  but i see that you look at meimpatiently monsieur de catinat and i know that you count the hoursuntil we are back at sainte marie again</s>  forward then and may thesecond part of our journey be as peaceful as the first</s> for an hour or more they picked their way through the woods followingin the steps of the old french pioneer</s>  it was a lovely day with hardlya cloud in the heavens and the sun streaming down through the thickfoliage covered the shaded sward with a delicate network of gold</s> sometimes where the woods opened they came out into the pure sunlightbut only to pass into thick glades beyond where a single ray here andthere was all that could break its way through the vast leafy covering</s> it would have been beautiful these sudden transitions from light toshade but with the feeling of impending danger and of a horror everlurking in these shadows the mind was tinged with awe rather thanadmiration</s>  silently lightly the four men picked their steps amongthe great tree trunks</s> suddenly du lhut dropped upon his knees and stooped his ear to theground</s>  he rose shook his head and walked on with a grave facecasting quick little glances into the shadows in every direction</s> did you hear something</s>  whispered amos</s> du lhut put his finger to his lips and then in an instant was downagain upon his face with his ear fixed to the ground</s>  he sprang up withthe look of a man who has heard what he expected to hear</s> walk on said he quietly and behave exactly as you have done allday</s> what is it then</s> indians</s> in front of us</s> no behind us</s> what are they doing</s> they are following us</s> how many of them</s> two i think</s> the friends glanced back involuntarily over their shoulders into thedense blackness of the forest</s>  at one point a single broad shaft oflight slid down between two pines and cast a golden blotch upon theirtrack</s>  save for this one vivid spot all was sombre and silent</s> do not look round whispered du lhut sharply</s>  walk on as before</s> are they enemies</s> they are iroquois</s> and pursuing us</s> no we are now pursuing them</s> shall we turn then</s> no they would vanish like shadowshow far off are they</s> about two hundred paces i think</s> they cannot see us then</s> i think not but i cannot be sure</s>  they are following our trail ithink</s> what shall we do then</s> let us make a circle and get behind them</s> turning sharp to the left he led them in a long curve through the woodshurrying swiftly and yet silently under the darkest shadows of thetrees</s>  then he turned again and presently halted</s> this is our own track said he</s> ay and two redskins have passed over it cried amos bending downand pointing to marks which were entirely invisible to ephraim savage orde catinat</s> a fullgrown warrior and a lad on his first warpath said du lhut</s> they were moving fast you see for you can hardly see the heel marksof their moccasins</s>  they walked one behind the other</s>  now let usfollow them as they followed us and see if we have better luck</s> he sped swiftly along the trail with his musket cocked in his hand theothers following hard upon his heels but there was no sound and nosign of life from the shadowy woods in front of them</s>  suddenly du lhutstopped and grounded his weapon</s> they are still behind us he said</s> still behind us</s> yes</s>  this is the point where we branched off</s>  they have hesitated amoment as you can see by their footmarks and then they have followedon</s> if we go round again and quicken our pace we may overtake them</s> no they are on their guard now</s>  they must know that it could only beon their account that we went back on our tracks</s>  lie here behind thefallen log and we shall see if we can catch a glimpse of them</s> a great rotten trunk all green with mould and blotched with pink andpurple fungi lay to one side of where they stood</s>  behind this thefrenchman crouched and his three companions followed his examplepeering through the brushwood screen in front of them</s>  still the onebroad sheet of sunshine poured down between the two pines but all elsewas as dim and as silent as a vast cathedral with pillars of wood androof of leaf</s>  not a branch that creaked nor a twig that snapped norany sound at all save the sharp barking of a fox

sportive mood among the oaksand yew hedges of versailles</s>  but the forfeit there was a carved fanor a box of bonbons and here it was death</s> ten minutes passed and there was no sign of any living

then</s> i saw a squirrel come from his hole in the great white beechtreeyonder</s>  he scuttled back again as if something had scared him</s> from his hole he can see down into that brushwood</s> do you think that they know that we are here</s> they cannot see us</s>  but they are suspicious</s>  they fear a trap</s> shall we rush for the brushwood</s> they would pick two of us off and be gone like shadows through thewoods</s>  no we had best go on our way</s> but they will follow us</s> i hardly think that they will</s>  we are four and they are only two andthey know now that we are on our

must push on fast now for where there are two iroquoisthere are likely to be two hundred not very far off</s> thank god that i did not bring adele</s>  cried de catinat</s> yes monsieur it is well for a man to make a comrade of his wife butnot on the borders of the iroquois country nor of any other indiancountry either</s> you do not take your own wife with you when you travel then</s>  askedthe soldier</s> yes but i do not let her travel from village to village</s>  she remainsin the wigwam</s> then you leave her behind</s> on the contrary she is always there to welcome me</s>  by saint anne ishould be heavyhearted if i came to any village between this and thebluffs of the illinois and did not find my wife waiting to greet me</s> then she must travel before you</s> du lhut laughed heartily without however emitting a sound</s> a fresh village a fresh wife said he</s>  but i never have more thanone in each for it is a shame for a frenchman to set an evil examplewhen the good fathers are spending their lives so freely in preachingvirtue to them</s>  ah here is the ajidaumo creek where the indians setthe sturgeon nets</s>  it is still seven miles to poitou</s> we shall be there before nightfall then</s> i think that we had best wait for nightfall before we make our way in</s> since the iroquois scouts are out as far as this it is likely that theylie thick round poitou and we may find the last step the worst unlesswe have a care the more so if these two get in front of us to warn theothers</s>  he paused a moment with slanting head and sidelong ear</s> by saint anne he muttered we have not shaken them off</s>  they arestill upon our trail</s> you hear them</s> yes they are no great way from us</s>  they will find that they havefollowed us once too often this

put them on as if they were gloves said the pioneer and an instantlater ephraim savage and amos had their comrades shoes upon theirhands</s> you can sling your muskets over your back</s>  so</s>  now down on all foursbending yourselves double with your hands pressing hard upon the earth</s> that is excellent</s>  two men can leave the trail of four</s>  now come withme monsieur</s> he flitted from tree to tree on a line which was parallel to but a fewyards distant from that of their comrades</s>  then suddenly he crouchedbehind a bush and pulled de catinat down beside him</s> they must pass us in a few minutes he whispered</s>  do not fire if youcan help it</s>  something gleamed in du lhuts hand and his comradeglancing down saw that he had drawn a keen little tomahawk from hisbelt</s>  again the mad wild thrill ran through the soldiers blood as hepeered through the tangled branches and waited for whatever might comeout of the dim silent aisles of treeboles</s> and suddenly he saw something move</s>  it flitted like a shadow from onetrunk to the other so swiftly that de catinat could not have toldwhether it were beast or human</s>  and then again he saw it and yetagain sometimes one shadow sometimes two shadows silent furtivelike the loupgarou with which his nurse had scared him in hischildhood</s>  then for a few moments all was still once more and then inan instant there crept out from among the bushes the mostterriblelooking creature that ever walked the earth an iroquois chiefupon the wartrail</s> he was a tall powerful man and his bristle of scalplocks and eaglefeathers made him look a giant in the dim light for a good eight feetlay between his beaded moccasin and the topmost plume of his headgear</s> one side of his face was painted in soot ochre and vermilion toresemble a dog and the other half as a fowl so that the front view wasindescribably grotesque and strange</s>  a belt of wampum was braced roundhis loincloth and a dozen scalplocks fluttered out as he moved fromthe fringe of his leggings</s>  his head was sunk forward his eyes gleamedwith a sinister light and his nostrils dilated and contracted likethose of an excited animal</s>  his gun was thrown forward and he creptalong with bended knees peering listening pausing hurrying on abreathing image of caution</s>  two paces behind him walked a lad offourteen clad and armed in the same fashion but without the paintedface and without the horrid dried trophies upon the leggings</s>  it washis first campaign and already his eyes shone and his nostrils twitchedwith the same lust for murder which burned within his elder</s>  so theyadvanced silent terrible creeping out of the shadows of the wood astheir race had come out of the shadows of history with bodies of ironand tiger souls</s> they were just abreast of the bush when something caught the eye of theyounger warrior some displaced twig or fluttering leaf and he pausedwith suspicion in every feature</s>  another instant and he had warned hiscompanion but du lhut sprang out and buried his little hatchet in theskull of the older warrior</s>  de catinat heard a dull crash as when anaxe splinters its way into a rotten tree and the man fell like a loglaughing horribly and kicking and striking with his powerful limbs</s> the younger warrior sprang like a deer over his fallen comrade anddashed on into the wood but an instant later there was a gunshot amongthe trees in front followed by a faint wailing cry</s> that is his deathwhoop said du lhut composedly</s>  it was a pity tofire and yet it was better than letting him go</s> as he spoke the two others came back ephraim ramming a fresh chargeinto his musket</s> who was laughing</s>  asked amos</s> it was he said du lhut nodding towards the dying warrior who laywith his head in a horrible puddle and his grotesque features contortedinto a fixed smile</s>  its a custom they have when they get theirdeathblow</s>  ive known a seneca chief laugh for six hours on end at thetorturestake</s>  ah hes gone</s> as he spoke the indian gave a last spasm with his hands and feet andlay rigid grinning up at the slit of blue sky above him</s> hes a great chief said du lhut</s>  he is brown moose of the mohawksand the other is his second son</s>  we have drawn first blood but i donot think that it will be the last for the iroquois do not allow theirwarchiefs to die unavenged</s>  he was a mighty fighter as you may see bylooking at his neck</s> he wore a peculiar necklace which seemed to de catinat to consist ofblackened bean pods set upon a string</s>  as he stooped over it he saw tohis horror that they were not bean pods but withered human fingers</s> they are all right forefingers said du lhut so everyone representsa life</s>  there are fortytwo in all</s>  eighteen are of men whom he hasslain in battle and the other twentyfour have been taken andtortured</s> how do you know that</s> because only eighteen have their nails on</s>  if the prisoner of aniroquois be alive he begins always by biting his nails off</s>  you seethat they are missing from fourandtwenty</s> de catinat shuddered</s>  what demons were these amongst whom an evil fatehad drifted him</s>  and was it possible that his adele should fall intothe hands of such fiends</s>  no no surely the good god for whose sakethey had suffered so much would not permit such an infamy</s>  and yet asevil a fate had come upon other women as tender as adeleupon other menas loving as he</s>  what hamlet was there in canada which had not suchstories in their record</s>  a vague horror seized him as he stood there</s> we know more of the future than we are willing to admit away down inthose dim recesses of the soul where there is no reason but onlyinstincts and impressions</s>  now some impending terror cast its cloudover him</s>  the trees around with their great protruding limbs werelike shadowy demons thrusting out their gaunt arms to seize him</s> the sweat burst from his forehead and he leaned heavily upon hismusket</s> by saint eulalie said du lhut for an old soldier you turn verypale monsieur at a little bloodshed</s> i am not well</s>  i should be glad of a sup from your cognac bottle</s> here it is comrade and welcome</s>  well i may as well have this finescalp that we may have something to show for our walk</s>  he held theindians head between his knees and in an instant with a sweep of hisknife had torn off the hideous dripping trophy</s> let us go</s>  cried de catinat turning away in disgust</s> yes we shall go</s>  but i shall also have this wampum belt marked withthe totem of the bear</s>  so</s>  and the gun too</s>  look at the londonprinted upon the lock</s>  ah monsieur green monsieur green it is nothard to see where the enemies of france get their arms</s> so at last they turned away du lhut bearing his spoils leaving the redgrinning figure stretched under the silent trees</s>  as they passed onthey caught a glimpse of the lad lying doubled up among the bushes wherehe had fallen</s>  the pioneer walked very swiftly until he came to alittle stream which prattled down to the big river</s>  here he slipped offhis boots and leggings and waded down it with his companions for half amile or so</s> they will follow our tracks when they find him said he but thiswill throw them off for it is only on running water that an iroquoiscan find no trace</s>  and now we shall lie in this clump until nightfallfor we are little over a mile from port poitou and it is dangerous togo forward for the ground becomes more open</s> and so they remained concealed among the alders whilst the shadowsturned from short to long and the white drifting clouds above them weretinged with the pink of the setting sun</s>  du lhut coiled himself into aball with his pipe between his teeth and dropped into a light sleeppricking up his ears and starting at the slightest sound from the woodsaround them</s>  the two americans whispered together for a long timeephraim telling some long story about the cruise of the brig industrybound to jamestown for sugar and molasses but at last the soothing humof a gentle breeze through the branches lulled them off also and theyslept</s>  de catinat alone remained awake his nerves still in a tinglefrom that strange sudden shadow which had fallen upon his soul</s>  whatcould it mean</s>  not surely that adele was in danger</s>  he had heard ofsuch warnings but had he not left her in safety behind cannons andstockades</s>  by the next evening at latest he would see her again</s>  as helay looking up through the tangle of copper leaves at the sky beyondhis mind drifted like the clouds above him and he was back once more inthe jutting window in the rue st</s>  martin sitting on the broad bancalwith its spanish leather covering with the gilt woolbale creakingoutside and his arm round shrinking timid adele she who had comparedherself to a little mouse in an old house and who yet had courage tostay by his side through all this wild journey</s>  and then again he wasback at versailles</s>  once more he saw the brown eyes of the king thefair bold face of de montespan the serene features of de maintenononce more he rode on his midnight mission was driven by the demoncoachman and sprang with amos upon the scaffold to rescue the mostbeautiful woman in france</s>  so clear it was and so vivid that it waswith a start that he came suddenly to himself and found that the nightwas creeping on in an american forest and that du lhut had rousedhimself and was ready for a start</s> have you been awake</s>  asked the pioneer</s> yes</s> have you heard anything</s> nothing but the hooting of the owl</s> it seemed to me that in my sleep i heard a gunshot in the distance</s> in your sleep</s> yes i hear as well asleep as awake and remember what i hear</s>  but nowyou must follow me close and we shall be in the fort soon</s> you have wonderful ears indeed said de catinat as they picked theirway through the tangled wood</s>  how could you hear that these men werefollowing us today</s>  i could make out no sound when they were withinhandtouch of us</s> i did not hear them at first</s> you saw them</s> no nor that either</s> then how could you know that they were there</s> i heard a frightened jay flutter among the trees after we were past

swarming with iroquois although we havehad the good fortune to miss them</s>  so great a chief as brown moosewould not start on the path with a small following nor for a smallobject</s>  they must mean mischief upon the richelieu</s>  you are not sorrynow that you did not bring madame</s> i thank god for it</s> the woods will not be safe i fear until the partridge berries are outonce more</s>  you must stay at sainte marie until then unless theseigneur can spare men to guard you</s> i had rather stay there forever than expose my wife to such devils</s> ay devils they are if ever devils walked upon earth</s>  you wincedmonsieur when i took brown mooses scalp but when you have seen asmuch of the indians as i have done your heart will be as hardened asmine</s>  and now we are on the very borders of the clearing and theblockhouse lies yonder among the clump of maples</s>  they do not keep verygood watch for i have been expecting during these last ten minutes tohear the qui

does so now said amos</s>  i see a dozen of them drawn up in a lineat their drill</s> no sentinels and all the men at drill</s>  cried du lhut in contempt</s> it is as you say however for i can see them myself with their ranksopen and each as stiff and straight as a pine stump</s>  one would thinkto see them stand so still that there was not an indian nearer thanorange</s>  we shall go across to them and by saint anne i shall telltheir commander what i think of his arrangements</s> du lhut advanced from the bushes as he spoke and the four men crossedthe open ground in the direction of the line of men who waited silentlyfor them in the dim twilight</s>  they were within fifty paces and yetnone of them had raised hand or voice to challenge their approach</s> there was something uncanny in the silence and a change came over dulhuts face as he peered in front of him</s>  he craned his head round andlooked up the river</s> my god</s>  he screamed</s>  look at the fort</s>  they had cleared the clumpof trees and the outline of the blockhouse should have shown up infront of them</s>  there was no sign of it</s>  it was gone</s> chapter xxxiv</s> the men of blood</s> so unexpected was the blow that even de lhut hardened from hischildhood to every shock and danger stood shaken and dismayed</s> then with an oath he ran at the top of his speed towards the line offigures his companions following at his heels</s> as they drew nearer they could see through the dusk that it was notindeed a line</s>  a silent and motionless officer stood out some twentypaces in front of his silent and motionless men</s>  further they couldsee that he wore a very high and singular headdress</s>  they were stillrushing forward breathless with apprehension when to their horror thisheaddress began to lengthen and broaden and a great bird flappedheavily up and dropped down again on the nearest treetrunk</s>  then theyknew that their worst fears were true and that it was the garrison ofpoitou which stood before them</s> they were lashed to low posts with willow withies some twenty of themnaked all and twisted and screwed into every strange shape which anagonised body could assume</s>  in front where the buzzard had perched wasthe grayheaded commandant with two cinders thrust into his sockets andhis flesh hanging from him like a beggars rags</s>  behind was the line ofmen each with his legs charred off to the knees and his body sohaggled and scorched and burst that the willow bands alone seemed tohold it together</s>  for a moment the four comrades stared in silenthorror at the dreadful group</s>  then each acted as his nature bade him</s> de catinat staggered up against a treetrunk and leaned his head uponhis arm deadly sick</s>  du lhut fell down upon his knees and saidsomething to heaven with his two clenched hands shaking up at thedarkening sky</s>  ephraim savage examined the priming of his gun with atightened lip and a gleaming eye while amos green without a wordbegan to cast round in circles in search of a trail</s> but du lhut was on his feet again in a moment and running up and downlike a sleuthhound noting a hundred things which even amos would haveoverlooked</s>  he circled round the bodies again and again</s>  then he ran alittle way towards the edge of the woods and then came back to thecharred ruins of the blockhouse from some of which a thin reek of smokewas still rising</s> there is no sign of the women and children said he</s> my god</s>  there were women and children</s> they are keeping the children to burn at their

seamans suggestions</s>  we must have a carenow said he or we shall lose our own scalps and be the cause ofthose at sainte marie losing theirs as well</s> sainte marie</s>  cried de catinat</s>  is there then danger at saintemarie</s> ay they are in the wolfs mouth now</s>  this business was done lastnight</s>  the place was stormed by a warparty of a hundred and fifty men</s> this morning they

younger comrades was already limping and footsore but forall his age he was as tough as hickory and full of endurance</s>  du lhuttook the lead again and they turned their faces once more towards thenorth</s> the moon was shining brightly in the sky but it was little aid to thetravellers in the depths of the forest</s>  where it had been shadowy inthe daytime it was now so absolutely dark that de catinat could not seethe treetrunks against which he brushed</s>  here and there they came uponan open glade bathed in the moonshine or perhaps a thin shaft of silverlight broke through between the branches and cast a great white patchupon the ground but du lhut preferred to avoid these more open spacesand to skirt the glades rather than to cross them</s>  the breeze hadfreshened a little and the whole air was filled with the rustle andsough of the leaves</s>  save for this dull neverceasing sound all wouldhave been silent had not the owl hooted sometimes from among thetreetops and the nightjar whirred above their heads</s> dark as it was du lhut walked as swiftly as during the sunlight andnever hesitated about the track</s>  his comrades could see however thathe was taking them a different way to that which they had gone in themorning for twice they caught a sight of the glimmer of the broad riverupon their left while before they had only seen the streams whichflowed into it</s>  on the second occasion he pointed to where on thefarther side they could see dark shadows flitting over the water</s> iroquois canoes he whispered</s>  there are ten of them with eight menin each</s>  they are another party and they are also going north</s> how do you know that they are another party</s> because we have crossed the trail of the first within the hour</s> de catinat was filled with amazement at this marvellous man who couldhear in his sleep and could detect a trail when the very treetrunkswere invisible to ordinary eyes</s>  du lhut halted a little to watch thecanoes and then turned his back to the river and plunged into thewoods once more</s>  they had gone a mile or two when suddenly he came to adead stop snuffing at the air like a hound on a scent</s> i smell burning wood said he</s>  there is a fire within a mile of usin that direction</s> i smell it too said amos</s>  let us creep up that way and see theircamp</s> be careful then whispered du lhut for your lives may hang from acracking twig</s> they advanced very slowly and cautiously until suddenly the red flare ofa leaping fire twinkled between the distant trunks</s>  still slippingthrough the brushwood they worked round until they had found a pointfrom which they could see without a risk of being seen</s> a great blaze of dry logs crackled and spurtled in the centre of a smallclearing</s>  the ruddy flames roared upwards and the smoke spread outabove it until it looked like a strange tree with gray foliage and trunkof fire</s>  but no living being was in sight and the huge fire roared andswayed in absolute solitude in the midst of the silent woodlands</s> nearer they crept and nearer but there was no movement save the rush ofthe flames and no sound but the snapping of the sticks</s> shall we go up to it</s>  whispered de catinat</s>  the wary old pioneershook his head</s>  it may be a trap said he</s> or an abandoned camp</s> no it has not been lit more than an hour</s> besides it is far too great for a camp fire said amos</s> what do you make of it</s>  asked du lhut</s> a signal</s> yes i daresay that you are right</s>  this light is not a safe neighbourso we shall edge away from it and then make a straight line for saintemarie</s> the flames were soon but a twinkling point behind them and at lastvanished behind the trees</s>  du lhut pushed on rapidly until they came tothe edge of a moonlit clearing</s>  he was about to skirt this as he haddone others when suddenly he caught de catinat by the shoulder andpushed him down behind a clump of sumach while amos did the same withephraim savage</s> a man was walking down the other side of the open space</s>  he had justemerged and was crossing it diagonally making in the direction of theriver</s>  his body was bent double but as he came out from the shadow ofthe trees they could see that he was an indian brave in full warpaintwith leggings loincloth and musket</s>  close at his heels came asecond and then a third and a fourth on and on until it seemed as ifthe wood were full of men and that the line would never come to an end</s> they flitted past like shadows in the moonlight in absolute silenceall crouching and running in the same swift stealthy fashion</s>  last ofall came a man in the fringed tunic of a hunter with a cap and featherupon his head</s>  he passed across like the others and they vanished intothe shadows as silently as they had appeared</s>  it was five minutesbefore du lhut thought it safe to rise from their shelter</s> by saint anne he whispered did you count them</s> three hundred and ninetysix said amos</s> i made it four hundred and two</s> and you thought that there were only a hundred and fifty of them</s> cried de catinat</s> ah you do not understand</s>  this is a fresh band</s>  the others who tookthe blockhouse must be over there for their trail lies between us andthe river</s> they could not be the same said amos for there was not a freshscalp among them</s> du lhut gave the young hunter a glance of approval</s>  on my word saidhe i did not know that your woodsmen are as good as they seem to be</s> you have eyes monsieur and it may please you some day to remember thatgreysolon du lhut told you so</s> amos felt a flush of pride at these words from a man whose name washonoured wherever trader or trapper smoked round a camp

again as they stood withblanched cheeks in the darkness they heard that awful cry swelling upfrom the night and ringing drearily through the forest</s> they are torturing the women said du lhut</s> their camp lies over there</s> can we do nothing to aid them</s>  cried amos</s> ay ay lad said the captain in english</s>  we cant pass distresssignals without going out of our course</s>  let us put about and run downyonder</s> in that camp said du lhut slowly there are now nearly six hundredwarriors</s>  we are four</s>  what you say has no sense</s>  unless we warn themat sainte marie these

truth said amos to ephraim</s>  nay but you must not goalone</s>  he seized the stout old seaman by the arm and held him by mainforce to prevent him from breaking off through the woods</s> there is one thing which we can do to spoil their nights amusementsaid du lhut</s>  the woods are as dry as powder and there has been nodrop of rain for a long three months</s> yes</s> and the wind blows straight for their camp with the river on the otherside of it</s> we should fire the woods</s> we cannot do better</s> in an instant du lhut had scraped together a little bundle of dry twigsand had heaped them up against a withered beech tree which was as dry astinder</s>  a stroke of flint and steel was enough to start a littlesmoulder of flame which lengthened and spread until it was leapingalong the white strips of hanging bark</s>  a quarter of a mile farther ondu lhut did the same again and once more beyond that until at threedifferent points the forest was in a blaze</s>  as they hurried onwardsthey could hear the dull roaring of the flames behind them and at lastas they neared sainte marie they could see looking back the longrolling wave of fire travelling ever westward

glance around and thenstepping up to de catinat laid his hand upon his shoulder</s> so you have not escaped me</s>  said he</s>  we have caught the evil seedbefore it has had time to root</s> what do

that they could hardly see the gleam of the river in front ofthem</s>  the savages in the woods and behind the captured stockade werequiet save for an occasional shot but the yells and whoops from thecottages of the censitaires showed that they were being plundered bytheir captors</s>  suddenly a dull red glow began to show above one of theroofs</s> they have set it on fire cried du lhut</s>  the canoes must go at oncefor the river will soon be as light as day</s>  in</s>  in</s>  there is not aninstant to lose</s> there was no time for leavetaking</s>  one impassioned kiss and adele

vanishedinto the drift and the darkness</s>  the great cloud had broken and therain pattered heavily upon the roof and splashed upon their faces asthey strained their eyes after the vanishing

as tinder</s>  he had hardly spoken before a great yellow tongue offlame licked out of one of the windows and again and again untilsuddenly half of the roof fell in and the cottage was blazing like apitchbucket</s>  the flames hissed and sputtered in the pouring rain butfed from below they grew still higher and fiercer flashing redly uponthe great trees and turning their trunks to burnished brass</s> their light made the enclosure and the manorhouse as clear as day andexposed the whole long stretch of the river</s>  a fearful yell from thewoods announced that the savages had seen the

some canoes down there said du lhut</s> but they must pass us</s>  cried the seigneur of sainte marie</s>  get downto the cannon and see if you cannot stop them</s> they had hardly reached the guns

de la noue</s>  lay for her as shepasses the great pine tree</s>  lambert do you take the other gun</s>  thelives of all whom you love may hang upon the shot</s> the two wrinkled old artillerymen glanced along their guns and waitedfor the canoes to come abreast of them</s>  the fire still blazed higherand higher and the broad river lay like a sheet of dull metal with twodark lines which marked the canoes sweeping swiftly down the centre</s> one was fifty yards in front of the other but in each the indians werebending to their paddles and pulling frantically while their comradesfrom the wooded shores whooped them on to fresh exertions</s> the fugitives had already disappeared round the bend of the river</s> as the first canoe came abreast of the lower of the two guns thecanadian made the sign of the cross over the touchhole and fired</s> a cheer and then a groan went up from the eager watchers</s>  the dischargehad struck the surface close to the mark and dashed such a shower ofwater over it that for an instant it looked as if it had been sunk</s> the next moment however the splash subsided and the canoe shot awayuninjured save that one of the rowers had dropped his paddle while hishead fell forward upon the back of the man in front of him</s>  the secondgunner sighted the same canoe as it came abreast of him but at the veryinstant when he stretched out his match to fire a bullet came hummingfrom the stockade and he fell forward dead without a groan</s> this is work that i know something of lad said old ephraimspringing suddenly forward</s>  but when i fire a gun i like to train itmyself</s>  give me a help with the handspike and get her straight for theisland</s>  so</s>  a little lower for an even keel</s>  now we have them</s> he clapped down his match and fired</s> it was a beautiful shot</s>  the whole charge took the canoe about six feetbehind the bow and doubled her up like an eggshell</s>  before the smokehad cleared she had foundered and the

seigneur</s>  load the gun</s>  we may get thesecond one yet</s> but it was not to be</s>  long before they could get it ready the iroquoishad picked up their wounded warriors and were pulling madly

hisarms</s>  i can do what i like with it</s> you fiend</s>  you have ruined us</s> i have found you and you shall not escape me again</s> the hot blood flushed to the soldiers head and picking up the axe hetook a quick step forward</s>  the light from the open door shone upon thegrave harsh face of the friar but not a muscle twitched nor a featurechanged as he saw the axe whirl up in the hands of a furious man</s> he only signed himself with the cross and muttered a latin prayer underhis breath</s>  it was that composure which saved his life</s>  de catinathurled down the axe again with a bitter curse and was turning away fromthe shattered boat when in an instant without a warning the greatdoor of the manorhouse crashed inwards and a flood of whooping savagesburst into the house</s> chapter xxxviii</s> the dining hall of sainte marie</s> what had occurred is easily explained</s>  the watchers in the windows atthe front found that it was more than flesh and blood could endure toremain waiting at their posts while the fates of their wives andchildren were being decided at the back</s>  all was quiet at the stockadeand the indians appeared to be as absorbed as the canadians in what waspassing upon the river</s>  one by one therefore the men on guard hadcrept away and had assembled at the back to cheer the seamans shot andto groan as the remaining canoe sped like a bloodhound down the river inthe wake of the fugitives</s>  but the savages had one at their head whowas as full of wiles and resource as du lhut himself</s>  the flemishbastard had watched the house from behind the stockade as a dog watchesa rathole and he had instantly discovered that the defenders had lefttheir post</s>  with a score of other warriors he raised a great log fromthe edge of the forest and crossing the open space unchallenged he andhis men rushed it against the door with such violence as to crack thebar across and tear the wood from the hinges</s>  the first intimationwhich the survivors had of the attack was the crash of the door and thescreams of two of the negligent watchmen who had been seized and scalpedin the hall</s>  the whole basement floor was in the hands of the indiansand de catinat and his enemy the friar were cut off from the foot of thestairs</s> fortunately however the manorhouses of canada were built with the oneidea of defence against indians and even now there were hopes for thedefenders</s>  a wooden ladder which could be drawn up in case of need hungdown from the upper windows to the ground upon the riverside</s> de catinat rushed round to this followed by the friar</s>  he felt aboutfor the ladder in the darkness</s>  it was gone</s> then indeed his heart sank in despair</s>  where could he fly to</s>  the boatwas destroyed</s>  the stockades lay between him and the forest and theywere in the hands of the iroquois</s>  their yells were ringing in hisears</s>  they had not seen him yet but in a few minutes they must comeupon

cried de catinat</s>  down with the ladder or iam a dead man</s> have a care</s>  it may be a ruse said the voice of du lhut</s> no no ill answer for it cried amos and an instant later down camethe ladder</s>  de catinat and the friar rushed up it and they hardly hadtheir feet upon the rungs when a swarm of warriors burst out from thedoor and poured along the river bank</s>  two muskets flashed from abovesomething plopped like a salmon in the water and next instant the twowere among their comrades and the ladder had been drawn up once more</s> but it was a very small band who now held the

canall load and pass the guns</s>  monsieur green will you kneel with me andyou jean duval</s>  if one of us is hit let another take his place atonce</s>  now be ready for they are coming</s> as he

to dothat</s>  ah listen to that</s> the yellings and screechings had begun again but there was a wildermadder ring in their shrillness and they were mingled with snatches ofsong and bursts of laughter</s> ha</s>  it is the brandy casks which they have opened cried du lhut</s> they were bad before but they will be fiends out of hell now</s> as he spoke there came another burst of whoops and

rolledacross the floor in the lamplight</s> down</s>  down</s>  it is a bomb</s>  cried de catinatbut it lay at du lhuts feet and he had seen it clearly</s>  he took acloth from the table and dropped it over it</s> it is not a bomb said he quietly and it was jean corbeil whodied</s> for four hours sounds of riot of dancing and of revelling rose up fromthe storehouse and the smell of the open brandy casks filled the wholeair</s>  more than once the savages quarrelled and fought among themselvesand it seemed as if they had forgotten their enemies above but thebesieged soon found that if they attempted to presume upon this theywere as closely watched as ever</s>  the majordomo theuriet passingbetween a loophole and a light was killed instantly by a bullet fromthe stockade and both amos and the old seigneur had narrow escapesuntil they blocked all the windows save that which overlooked the river</s> there was no danger from this one and as day was already breaking oncemore one or other of the party was forever straining their eyes downthe stream in search of the expected succour</s> slowly the light crept up the eastern sky a little line of pearl thena band of pink broadening stretching spreading until it shot itswarm colour across the heavens tinging the edges of the driftingclouds</s>  over the woodlands lay a thin gray vapour the tops of the highoaks jutting out like dim islands from the sea of haze</s>  gradually asthe light increased the mist shredded off into little ragged wispswhich thinned and drifted away until at last as the sun pushed itsglowing edge over the eastern forests it gleamed upon the reds andoranges and purples of the fading leaves and upon the broad blue riverwhich curled away to the northward</s>  de catinat as he stood at thewindow looking out was breathing in the healthy resinous scent of thetrees mingled with the damp heavy odour of the wet earth when suddenlyhis eyes fell upon a dark spot upon the river to the north of them</s> there is a canoe coming down</s>  he cried</s>  in an instant they had allrushed to the opening but du lhut sprang after them and pulled themangrily towards the door</s> do you wish to die before your time</s>  he cried</s> ay ay</s>  said captain ephraim who understood the gesture if not thewords</s>  we must leave a watch on deck</s>  amos lad lie here with me andbe ready if they show</s> the two americans and the old pioneer held the barricade while the eyesof all the others were turned upon the approaching boat</s>  a groan brokesuddenly from the only surviving censitaire</s> it is an iroquois canoe</s>  he cried</s> impossible</s> alas your excellency it is so and it is the same one which passed uslast night</s> ah then the women have escaped them</s> i trust so</s>  but alas seigneur i fear that there are more in thecanoe now than when they passed us</s> the little group of survivors waited in breathless anxiety while thecanoe sped swiftly up the river with a line of foam on either side ofher and a long forked swirl in the waters behind</s>  they could see thatshe appeared to be very crowded but they remembered that the wounded ofthe other boat were aboard her</s>  on she shot and on until as she cameabreast of the fort she swung round and the rowers raised their paddlesand burst into a shrill yell of derision</s>  the stern of the canoe wasturned towards them now and they saw that two women were seated in it</s> even at that distance there was no mistaking the sweet pale face or thedark queenly one beside it</s>  the one was onega and the other was adele</s> chapter xxxix</s> the two swimmers</s>
 yet even now his oldfashioned courtesy to hisguest had made him turn to de catinat with some words of sympathy whenthere was a clatter of wood something darkened the light of the windowand the young soldier was gone</s>  without a word he had lowered theladder and was clambering down it with frantic haste</s>  then as his feettouched the ground he signalled to his comrades to draw it up again anddashing into the river he swam towards the canoe</s>  without arms andwithout a plan he had but the one thought that his place was by the sideof his wife in this the hour of her danger</s>  fate should bring him whatit brought her and he swore to himself as he clove a way with hisstrong arms that whether it were life or death they should still shareit together</s> but there was another whose view of duty led him from safety into theface of danger</s>  all night the franciscan had watched de catinat as amiser watches his treasure filled with the thought that this hereticwas the one little seed which might spread and spread until it chokedthe chosen vineyard of the church</s>  now when he saw him rush so suddenlydown the ladder every fear was banished from his mind save theoverpowering one that he was about to lose his precious charge</s> he too clambered down at the very heels of his prisoner and rushedinto the stream not ten paces behind him</s> and so the watchers at the window saw the strangest of sights</s> there in midstream lay the canoe with a ring of dark warriorsclustering in the stern and the two women crouching in the midst ofthem</s>  swimming madly towards them was de catinat rising to theshoulders with the strength of every stroke and behind him again wasthe tonsured head of the friar with his brown capote and long trailinggown floating upon the surface of the water behind him</s>  but in his zealhe had thought too little of his own powers</s>  he was a good swimmer buthe was weighted and hampered by his unwieldy clothes</s>  slower and slowergrew his stroke lower and lower his head until at last with a greatshriek of in manus tuas domine</s>  he threw up his hands and vanishedin the swirl of the river</s>  a minute later the watchers hoarse withscreaming to him to return saw de catinat pulled aboard the iroquoiscanoe which was instantly turned and continued its course up the river</s> my god</s>  cried amos hoarsely</s>  they have taken him</s>  he is lost</s> i have seen some strange things in these forty years but never thelike of that</s>  said du lhut</s> the seigneur took a little pinch of snuff from his gold box and flickedthe

cried the censitaire who was peepingthrough one of the side windows</s>  what can it mean</s>  holy virgin is itpossible that we are saved</s>  see how they throng through the trees</s> they are

give my next years trade tobring him down</s> it is forty paces further than my musket would carry remarked dulhut but i have seen the english shoot a great way with those longguns</s> amos took a steady aim resting his gun upon the window sill and fired</s> a shout of delight burst from the little knot of survivors</s>  the flemishbastard had fallen</s>  but he was on his feet again in an instant andshook his hand defiantly at the window</s> curse it</s>  cried amos bitterly in english</s>  i have hit him with aspent ball</s>  as well strike him with a pebble</s> nay curse not amos lad

and his warriorshad disappeared</s>  on the river the single iroquois canoe which held thecaptives was speeding south as swiftly as twenty paddles could drive itbut save this one dark streak upon the blue stream not a sign was to beseen of their enemies</s>  they had vanished as if they had been an evildream</s>  there was the bulletspotted stockade the litter of dead bodiesinside it the burned

gone</s>  cried the seigneur</s> take care that it is not a ruse said du lhut</s>  why should they flybefore six men when they have conquered sixty</s> but the censitaire had looked out of the other window and in aninstant he was down upon his knees with his hands in the air and hispowder blackened face turned upwards pattering out prayers andthanksgivings</s>  his five comrades rushed across the room and burst intoa shriek of joy</s>  the upper reach of the river was covered with aflotilla of canoes from which the sun struck quick flashes as it shoneupon the musketbarrels and trappings of the crews</s>  already they couldsee the white coats of the regulars the brown tunics of thecoureursdebois and the gaudy colours of the hurons and algonquins</s> on they swept dotting the whole breadth of the river and growinglarger every instant while far away on the southern bend the iroquoiscanoe was a mere moving dot which had shot away to the farther side andlost itself presently under the shadow of the trees</s>  another minute andthe survivors were out upon the bank waving their caps in the airwhile the prows of the first of their rescuers were already grating uponthe pebbles</s>  in the stern of the very foremost canoe sat a wizenedlittle man with a large brown wig and a giltheaded rapier laid acrosshis knees</s>  he sprang out as the keel touched bottom splashing throughthe shallow

jump in then and forward for life and death may hang upon ourspeed</s> chapter xl</s> the end</s> the iroquois had not treated de catinat harshly when they dragged himfrom the water into their canoe</s>  so incomprehensible was it to them whyany man should voluntarily leave a place of safety in order to puthimself in their power that they could only set it down to madness amalady which inspires awe and respect among the indians</s>  they did noteven tie his wrists for why should he attempt to escape when he hadcome of his own free will</s>  two warriors passed their hands over him

then they ran the canoe into a littlecreek upon their own side of the river and sprang out of her draggingthe prisoners after them</s>  the canoe was carried on the shoulders ofeight men some distance into the wood where they concealed it betweentwo fallen trees heaping a litter of branches over it to screen it fromview</s>  then after a short council they started through the forestwalking in single file with their three prisoners in the middle</s> there were fifteen warriors in all eight in front and seven behind allarmed with muskets and as swiftfooted as deer so that escape was outof the question</s>  they could but follow on and wait in patience forwhatever might befall them</s> all day they pursued their dreary march picking their way through vastmorasses skirting the borders of blue woodland lakes where the graystork flapped heavily up from the reeds at their approach or plunginginto dark belts of woodland where it is always twilight and where thefalling of the wild chestnuts and the chatter of the squirrels a hundredfeet above their heads were the only sounds which broke the silence</s> onega had the endurance of the indians themselves but adele in spiteof her former journeys was footsore and weary before evening</s>  it was arelief to de catinat therefore when the red glow of a great fire beatsuddenly through the treetrunks and they came upon an indian

be nearer tothe warriors</s>  wigwams had been erected all round in a circle andbefore each of them were the fires with kettles slung upon a tripod ofsticks in which the evening meal was being cooked</s>  in the centre of allwas a very fierce fire which had been made of brushwood placed in acircle so as to leave a clear space of twelve feet in the middle</s> a pole stood up in the centre of this clearing and something allmottled with red and black was tied up against it</s>  de catinat steppedswiftly in front of adele that she might not see the dreadful thing buthe was too late</s>  she shuddered and drew a quick breath between herpale lips but no sound escaped her</s> they have begun already then said onega composedly</s>  well it willbe our turn next and we shall show them that we

dropped forward upon his chest and he staggered and would havefallen had adele not caught him by the arm</s> do not fear dear amory she whispered</s>  other things may happen butnot that for i swear to you that i shall not survive you</s>  no it maybe sin or it may not but if death will not come to me i will go toit</s> de catinat looked down at the gentle face which had set now into thehard lines of an immutable resolve</s>  he knew that it would be as she hadsaid and that come what might that last outrage would not befallthem</s>  could he ever have believed that the time would come when itwould send a thrill of joy through his heart to know that his wife woulddie</s> as they entered the iroquois village the squaws and warriors had rushedtowards them and they passed through a double line of hideous faceswhich jeered and jibed and howled at them as they passed</s>  their escortled them through this rabble and conducted them to a hut which stoodapart</s>  it was empty save for some willow fishingnets hanging at theside and a heap of pumpkins stored in the corner</s> the chiefs will come and will decide upon what is to be done with ussaid onega</s>  here they are coming now and you will soon see that i amright for i know the ways of my own people</s> an instant later an old warchief accompanied by two younger braves andby the bearded halfdutch iroquois who had led the attack upon themanorhouse strolled over and stood in the doorway looking in at theprisoners and shooting little guttural sentences at each other</s> the totems of the hawk the wolf the bear and the snake showed thatthey each represented one of the great families of the nation</s> the bastard was smoking a stone pipe and yet it was he who talked themost arguing apparently with one of the younger savages who seemed tocome round at last to his opinion</s>  finally the old chief said a fewshort stern words and the matter appeared to be settled</s> and you you beldame said the bastard in french to the iroquoiswoman you will have a lesson this night which will teach you to sideagainst your own people</s> you halfbred mongrel replied the fearless old woman you shouldtake that hat from your head when you speak to one in whose veins runsthe best blood of the onondagas</s>  you a warrior</s>  you who with athousand at your back could not make your way into a little house witha few poor husbandmen within it</s>  it is no wonder that your fatherspeople have cast you out</s>  go back and work at the beads or play at thegame of plumstones for some day in the woods you might meet with aman and so bring disgrace upon the nation which has taken you in</s> the evil face of the bastard grew livid as he listened to the scornfulwords which were hissed at him by the captive</s>  he strode across to herand taking her hand he thrust her forefinger into the burning bowl ofhis pipe</s>  she made no effort to remove it but sat with a perfectly setface for a minute or more looking out through the open door at theevening sunlight and the little groups of chattering indians</s>  he hadwatched her keenly in the hope of hearing a cry or seeing some spasm ofagony upon her face but at last with a curse he dashed down her handand strode from the hut</s>  she thrust her charred finger into her bosomand laughed</s> he is a goodfornought</s>  she cried</s>  he does not even know how totorture</s>  now i could have got a cry out of him</s>  i am sure of it</s> but youmonsieur you are very white</s> it was the sight of such a hellish deed</s>  ah if we were but set faceto face i with my sword he with what weapon he chose by god heshould pay for it with his hearts blood</s> the indian woman seemed surprised</s>  it is strange to me she saidthat you should think of what befalls me when you are yourselves underthe same shadow</s>  but our fate will be as i said</s> ah</s> you and i are to die at the stake</s>  she is to be given to the dog whohas left us</s> ah</s> adele</s>  adele</s>  what shall i do</s>  he tore his hair in his helplessnessand distraction</s> no no fear not amory for my heart will not fail me</s>  what is thepang of death if it binds us together</s> the younger chief pleaded for you saying that the mitche manitou hadstricken you with madness as could be seen by your swimming to theircanoe and that a blight would fall upon the nation if you were led tothe stake</s>  but this bastard said that love came often like madnessamong the palefaces and that it was that alone which had driven you</s> then it was agreed that you should die and that she should go to hiswigwam since he had led the warparty</s>  as for me their hearts werebitter against me and i also am to die by the pine splinters</s> de catinat breathed a prayer that he might meet his fate like a soldierand a gentleman</s> when is it to be</s>  he asked</s> now</s>  at once</s>  they have gone to make all ready</s>  but you have timeyet for i am to go first</s> amory amory could we not die together now</s>  cried adele throwing herarms round her husband</s>  if it be sin it is surely a sin which will beforgiven us</s>  let us go dear</s>  let us leave these dreadful people andthis cruel world and turn where we shall find peace</s> the indian womans eyes flashed with satisfaction</s> you have spoken well white lily said she</s>  why should you waituntil it is their pleasure to pluck you</s>  see already the glare oftheir fire beats upon the treetrunks and you can hear the howlings ofthose who thirst for your blood</s>  if you die by your own hands theywill be robbed of their spectacle and their chief will have lost hisbride</s>  so you will be the victors in the end and they the vanquished</s> you have said rightly white lily</s>  there lies the only path for you</s> but how to take it</s> onega glanced keenly at the two warriors who stood as sentinels at thedoor of the hut</s>  they had turned away absorbed in the horriblepreparations which were going on</s>  then she rummaged deeply within thefolds of her loose gown and pulled out a small pistol with two brassbarrels and double triggers in the form of winged dragons</s>  it was onlya toy to look at all carved and scrolled and graven with the choicestwork of the paris gunsmith</s>  for its beauty the seigneur had bought itat his last visit to quebec and yet it might be useful too and it wasloaded in both barrels</s> i meant to use it on myself said she as she slipped it into the handof de catinat</s>  but now i am minded to show them that i can die as anonondaga should die and that i am worthy to have the blood of theirchiefs in my veins</s>  take it for i swear that i will not use it myselfunless it be to fire both bullets into that bastards heart</s> a flush of joy shot over de catinat as his fingers closed round thepistol</s>  here was indeed a key to unlock the gates of peace</s>  adele laidher cheek against his shoulder and laughed with pleasure</s> you will forgive me dear he whispered</s> forgive you</s>  i bless you and love you with my whole heart and soul</s> clasp me close darling and say one prayer before you do it</s> they had sunk on their knees together when three warriors entered thehut and said a few abrupt words to their countrywoman</s>  she rose with asmile</s> they are waiting for me said she</s>  you shall see white lily andyou also monsieur how well i know what is due to my position</s> farewell and remember onega</s> she smiled again and walked from the hut amidst the warriors with thequick firm step of a queen who sweeps to a throne</s> now amory</s>  whispered adele closing her eyes and nestling stillcloser to him</s> he raised the pistol and then with a quick sudden intaking of thebreath he dropped it and knelt with glaring eyes looking up at a treewhich faced the open door of the hut</s> it was a beechtree exceedingly old and gnarled with its bark hangingdown in strips and its whole trunk spotted with moss and mould</s> some ten feet above the ground the main trunk divided into two and inthe fork thus formed a hand had suddenly appeared a large reddish handwhich shook frantically from side to side in passionate dissuasion</s> the next instant as the two captives still stared in amazement thehand disappeared behind the trunk again and a face appeared in itsplace which still shook from side to side as resolutely as itsforerunner</s>  it was impossible to mistake that mahogany wrinkled skinthe huge bristling eyebrows or the little glistening eyes</s>  it wascaptain ephraim savage of boston</s> and even as they stared and wondered a sudden shrill whistle burst outfrom the depths of the forest and in a moment every bush and thicketand patch of brushwood were spouting fire and smoke while the snarl ofthe musketry ran round the whole glade and the storm of bullets whizzedand pelted among the yelling savages</s>  the iroquois sentinels had beendrawn in by their bloodthirsty craving to see the prisoners die and nowthe canadians were upon them and they were hemmed in by a ring of fire</s> first one way and then another they rushed to be met always by the sameblast of death until finding at last some gap in the attack theystreamed through like sheep through a broken fence and rushed madlyaway through the forest with the bullets of their pursuers stillsinging about their ears until the whistle sounded again to recall thewoodsmen from the chase</s> but there was one savage who had found work to do before he fled</s> the flemish bastard had preferred his vengeance to his safety</s> rushing at onega he buried his tomahawk in her brain and then yellinghis warcry he waved the bloodstained weapon above his head and flewinto the hut where the prisoners still knelt</s>  de catinat saw himcoming and a mad joy glistened in his eyes</s>  he rose to meet him andas he rushed in he fired both barrels of his pistol into the bastardsface</s>  an instant later a swarm of canadians had rushed over thewrithing bodies the captives felt warm friendly hands which graspedtheir own and looking upon the smiling wellknown faces of amos greensavage and du lhut they knew that peace had come to them at last</s> and so the refugees came to the end of the toils of their journey forthat winter was spent by them in peace at fort st</s>  louis and in thespring the iroquois having carried the war to the upper st</s>  lawrencethe travellers were able to descend into the english provinces and soto make their way down the hudson to new york where a warm welcomeawaited them from the family of amos green</s>  the friendship between thetwo men was now so cemented together by common memories and commondanger that they soon became partners in furtrading and the name ofthe frenchman came at last to be as familiar in the mountains of maineand on the slopes of the alleghanies as it had once been in the salonsand corridors of versailles</s>  in time de catinat built a house on statenisland where many of his fellowrefugees had settled and much of whathe won from his furtrading was spent in the endeavour to help hisstruggling huguenot brothers</s>  amos green had married a dutch maiden ofschenectady and as adele and she became inseparable friends themarriage served to draw closer the ties of love which held the twofamilies together</s> as to captain ephraim savage he returned safely to his beloved bostonwhere he fulfilled his ambition by building himself a fair brick houseupon the rising ground in the northern part of the city whence he couldlook down both upon the shipping in the river and the bay</s>  there helived much respected by his townsfolk who made him selectman andalderman and gave him the command of a goodly ship when sir williamphips made his attack upon quebec and found that the old lion frontenacwas not to be driven from his lair</s>  so honoured by all the old seamanlived to an age which carried him deep into the next century when hecould already see with his dim eyes something of the growing greatnessof his country</s> the manorhouse of sainte marie was soon restored to its formerprosperity but its seigneur was from the day that he lost his wife andson a changed man</s>  he grew leaner fiercer less human forever headingparties which made their way into the iroquois woods and whichoutrivalled the savages themselves in the terrible nature of theirdeeds</s>  a day came at last when he sallied out upon one of theseexpeditions from which neither he nor any of his men ever returned</s>
note on the huguenots and their dispersion</s> towards the latter quarter of the seventeenth century there was hardlyan important industry in france which was not controlled by thehuguenots so that
