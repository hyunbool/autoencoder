the fame of my eight submarines alpha beta gamma thetadelta epsilon iota and kappa have spread through the world tosuch an extent that people have begun to think that there was somethingpeculiar in their form and capabilities</s>  this is not so</s>  four of themthe delta epsilon iota and kappa were it is true of thevery latest model but had their equals though not their superiors inthe navies of all the great powers</s>  as to alpha beta gamma andtheta they were by no means modern vessels and found their prototypesin the old f class of british boats having a submerged displacement ofeight hundred tons with heavy oil engines of sixteen hundredhorsepower giving them a speed of eighteen knots on the surface and oftwelve knots submerged</s>  their length was one hundred and eightysix andtheir breadth twentyfour feet</s>  they had a radius of action of fourthousand miles and a submerged endurance of nine hours</s>  these wereconsidered the latest word in 1915 but the four new boats exceeded themin all respects</s>  without troubling you with precise figures i may saythat they represented roughly a twentyfive per cent</s>  advance up on theolder boats and were fitted with several auxiliary engines which werewanting in the others</s>  at my suggestion instead of carrying eight ofthe very large bakdorf torpedoes which are nineteen feet long weighhalf a ton and are charged with two hundred pounds of wet guncotton wehad tubes designed for eighteen of less than half the size</s>  it was mydesign to make myself independent of my base</s> and yet it was clear that i must have a base so i made arrangements atonce with that object</s>  blankenberg was the last place i would havechosen</s>  why should i have a port of any kind</s>  ports would be watchedor occupied</s>  any place would do for me</s>  i finally chose a small villastanding alone nearly five miles from any village and thirty miles fromany port</s>  to this i ordered them to convey secretly by night oilspare parts extra torpedoes storage batteries reserve periscopes andeverything that i could need for refitting</s>  the little whitewashed villaof a retired confectionerthat was the base from which i operatedagainst england</s> the boats lay at blankenberg and thither i went</s>  they were workingfrantically at the defences and they had only to look seawards to bespurred to fresh exertions</s>  the british fleet was assembling</s>  theultimatum had not yet expired but it was evident that a blow would bestruck the instant that it did</s>  four of their aeroplanes circling at animmense height were surveying our defences</s>  from the top of thelighthouse i counted thirty battleships and cruisers in the offing witha number of the trawlers with which in the british service they breakthrough the minefields</s>  the approaches were actually sown with twohundred mines half contact and half observation but the result showedthat they were insufficient to hold off the enemy since three days laterboth town and fleet were speedily destroyed</s> however i am not here to tell you the incidents of the war but toexplain my own part in it which had such a decisive effect upon theresult</s>  my first action was to send my four secondclass boats awayinstantly to the point which i had chosen for my base</s>  there they wereto wait submerged lying with negative buoyancy upon the sands in twentyfoot of water and rising only at night</s>  my strict orders were that theywere to attempt nothing upon the enemy however tempting the opportunity</s> all they had to do was to remain intact and unseen until they receivedfurther orders</s>  having made this clear to commander panza who hadcharge of this reserve flotilla i shook him by the hand and bade himfarewell leaving with him a sheet of notepaper upon which i hadexplained the tactics to be used and given him certain general principleswhich he could apply as circumstances demanded</s> my whole attention was now given to my own flotilla which i divided intotwo divisions keeping iota and kappa under my own command whilecaptain miriam had delta and epsilon</s>  he was to operate separatelyin the british channel while my station was the straits of dover</s>  imade the whole plan of campaign clear to him</s>  then i saw that each shipwas provided with all it could carry</s>  each had forty tons of heavy oilfor surface propulsion and charging the dynamo which supplied theelectric engines under water</s>  each had also eighteen torpedoes asexplained and five hundred rounds for the collapsible quickfiring twelvepounder which we carried on deck and which of course disappeared intoa watertight tank when we were submerged</s>  we carried spare periscopesand a wireless mast which could be elevated above the conningtower whennecessary</s>  there were provisions for sixteen days for the ten men whomanned each craft</s>  such was the equipment of the four boats which weredestined to bring to naught all the navies and armies of britain</s>  atsundown that dayit was april 10thwe set forth upon our historicvoyage</s> miriam had got away in the afternoon since he had so much farther to goto reach his station</s>  stephan of the kappa started with me but ofcourse we realized that we must work independently and that from thatmoment when we shut the sliding hatches of our conningtowers on thestill waters of blankenberg harbour it was unlikely that we should eversee each other again though consorts in the same waters</s>  i waved tostephan from the side of my conningtower and he to me</s>  then i calledthrough the tube to my engineer our watertanks were already filled andall kingstons and vents closed to put her full speed ahead</s> just as we came abreast of the end of the pier and saw the whitecappedwaves rolling in upon us i put the horizontal rudder hard down and sheslid under water</s>  through my glass portholes i saw its light greenchange to a dark blue while the manometer in front of me indicatedtwenty feet</s>  i let her go to forty because i should then be under thewarships of the english though i took the chance of fouling the mooringsof our own floating contact mines</s>  then i brought her on an even keeland it was music to my ear to hear the gentle even ticking of myelectric engines and to know that i was speeding at twelve miles an houron my great task</s> at that moment as i stood controlling my levers in my tower i couldhave seen had my cupola been of glass the vast shadows of the britishblockaders hovering above me</s>  i held my course due westward for ninetyminutes and then by shutting off the electric engine without blowingout the watertanks i brought her to the surface</s>  there was a rollingsea and the wind was freshening so i did not think it safe to keep myhatch open long for so small is the margin of buoyancy that one must runno risks</s>  but from the crests of the rollers i had a look backwards atblankenberg and saw the black funnels and upper works of the enemysfleet with the lighthouse and the castle behind them all flushed withthe pink glow of the setting sun</s>  even as i looked there was the boom ofa great gun and then another</s>  i glanced at my watch</s>  it was sixoclock</s>  the time of the ultimatum had expired</s>  we were at war</s> there was no craft near us and our surface speed is nearly twice that ofour submerged so i blew out the tanks and our whaleback came over thesurface</s>  all night we were steering southwest making an average ofeighteen knots</s>  at about five in the morning as i stood alone upon mytiny bridge i saw low down in the west the scattered lights of thenorfolk coast</s>  ah johnny johnny bull i said as i looked at themyou are going to have your lesson and i am to be your master</s>  it is iwho have been chosen to teach you that one cannot live under artificialconditions and yet act as if they were natural ones</s>  more foresightjohnny and less party politicsthat is my lesson to you</s>  and then ihad a wave of pity too when i thought of those vast droves of helplesspeople yorkshire miners lancashire spinners birmingham metalworkersthe dockers and workers of london over whose little homes i would bringthe shadow of starvation</s>  i seemed to see all those wasted eager handsheld out for food and i john sirius dashing it aside</s>  ah well</s>  waris war and if one is foolish one must pay the price</s> just before daybreak i saw the lights of a considerable town which musthave been yarmouth bearing about ten miles westsouthwest on ourstarboard bow</s>  i took her farther out for it is a sandy dangerouscoast with many shoals</s>  at fivethirty we were abreast of the lowestoftlightship</s>  a coastguard was sending up flash signals which faded into apale twinkle as the white dawn crept over the water</s>  there was a gooddeal of shipping about mostly fishingboats and small coasting craftwith one large steamer hulldown to the west and a torpedo destroyerbetween us and the land</s>  it could not harm us and yet i thought it aswell that there should be no word of our presence so i filled my tanksagain and went down to ten feet</s>  i was pleased to find that we got underin one hundred and fifty seconds</s>  the life of ones boat may depend onthis when a swift craft comes suddenly upon you</s> we were now within a few hours of our cruising ground so i determined tosnatch a rest leaving vornal in charge</s>  when he woke me at ten oclockwe were running on the surface and had reached the essex coast off themaplin sands</s>  with that charming frankness which is one of theircharacteristics our friends of england had informed us by their pressthat they had put a cordon of torpedoboats across the straits of doverto prevent the passage of submarines which is about as sensible as tolay a wooden plank across a stream to keep the eels from passing</s>  i knewthat stephan whose station lay at the western end of the solent wouldhave no difficulty in reaching it</s>  my own cruising ground was to be atthe mouth of the thames and here i was at the very spot with my tinyiota my eighteen torpedoes my quickfiring gun and above all abrain that knew what should be done and how to do it</s> when i resumed my place in the conningtower i saw in the periscope forwe had dived that a lightship was within a few hundred yards of us uponthe port bow</s>  two men were sitting on her bulwarks but neither of themcast an eye upon the little rod that clove the water so close to them</s>  itwas an ideal day for submarine action with enough ripple upon thesurface to make us difficult to detect and yet smooth enough to give mea clear view</s>  each of my three periscopes had an angle of sixty degreesso that between them i commanded a complete semicircle of the horizon</s> two british cruisers were steaming north from the thames within half amile of me</s>  i could easily have cut them off and attacked them had iallowed myself to be diverted from my great plan</s>  farther south adestroyer was passing westwards to sheerness</s>  a dozen small steamerswere moving about</s>  none of these were worthy of my notice</s>  greatcountries are not provisioned by small steamers</s>  i kept the enginesrunning at the lowest pace which would hold our position under waterand moving slowly across the estuary i waited for what must assuredlycome</s> i had not long to wait</s>  shortly after one oclock i perceived in theperiscope a cloud of smoke to the south</s>  half an hour later a largesteamer raised her hull making for the mouth of the thames</s>  i orderedvornal to stand by the starboard torpedotube having the other alsoloaded in case of a miss</s>  then i advanced slowly for though the steamerwas going very swiftly we could easily cut her off</s>  presently i laid theiota in a position near which she must pass and would very gladly havelain to but could not for fear of rising to the surface</s>  i thereforesteered out in the direction from which she was coming</s>  she was a verylarge ship fifteen thousand tons at the least painted black above andred below with two creamcoloured funnels</s>  she lay so low in the waterthat it was clear she had a full cargo</s>  at her bows were a cluster ofmen some of them looking i dare say for the first time at the mothercountry</s>  how little could they have guessed the welcome that wasawaiting them</s> on she came with the great plumes of smoke floating from her funnels andtwo white waves foaming from her cutwater</s>  she was within a quarter ofa mile</s>  my moment had arrived</s>  i signalled full speed ahead and steeredstraight for her course</s>  my timing was exact</s>  at a hundred yards i gavethe signal and heard the clank and swish of the discharge</s>  at the sameinstant i put the helm hard down and flew off at an angle</s>  there was aterrific lurch which came from the distant explosion</s>  for a moment wewere almost upon our side</s>  then after staggering and trembling theiota came on an even keel</s>  i stopped the engines brought her to thesurface and opened the conningtower while all my excited crew camecrowding to the hatch to know what had happened</s> the ship lay within two hundred yards of us and it was easy to see thatshe had her deathblow</s>  she was already settling down by the stern</s> there was a sound of shouting and people were running wildly about herdecks</s>  her name was visible the adela of london bound as weafterwards learned from new zealand with frozen mutton</s>  strange as itmay seem to you the notion of a submarine had never even now occurred toher people and all were convinced that they had struck a floating mine</s> the starboard quarter had been blown in by the explosion and the shipwas sinking rapidly</s>  their discipline was admirable</s>  we saw boat afterboat slip down crowded with people as swiftly and quietly as if it werepart of their daily drill</s>  and suddenly as one of the boats lay offwaiting for the others they caught a glimpse for the first time of myconningtower so close to them</s>  i saw them shouting and pointing whilethe men in the other boats got up to have a better look at us</s>  for mypart i cared nothing for i took it for granted that they already knewthat a submarine had destroyed them</s>  one of them clambered back into thesinking ship</s>  i was sure that he was about to send a wireless message asto our presence</s>  it mattered nothing since in any case it must beknown otherwise i could easily have brought him down with a rifle</s>  asit was i waved my hand to them and they waved back to me</s>  war is toobig a thing to leave room for personal illfeeling but it must beremorseless all the same</s> i was still looking at the sinking adela when vornal who was besideme gave a sudden cry of warning and surprise gripping me by theshoulder and turning my head</s>  there behind us coming up the fairwaywas a huge black vessel with black funnels flying the wellknown houseflag of the p</s>  and o</s>  company</s>  she was not a mile distant and icalculated in an instant that even if she had seen us she would not havetime to turn and get away before we could reach her</s>  we went straightfor her therefore keeping awash just as we were</s>  they saw the sinkingvessel in front of them and that little dark speck moving over thesurface and they suddenly understood their danger</s>  i saw a number ofmen rush to the bows and there was a rattle of riflefire</s>  two bulletswere flattened upon our fourinch armour</s>  you might as well try to stopa charging bull with paper pellets as the iota with riflefire</s>  i hadlearned my lesson from the adela and this time i had the torpedodischarged at a safer distancetwo hundred and fifty yards</s>  we caughther amidships and the explosion was tremendous but we were well outsideits area</s>  she sank almost instantaneously</s>  i am sorry for her peopleof whom i hear that more than two hundred including seventy lascars andforty passengers were drowned</s>  yes i am sorry for them</s>  but when ithink of the huge floating granary that went to the bottom i rejoice asa man does who has carried out that which he plans</s> it was a bad afternoon that for the p</s>  and o</s>  company</s>  the second shipwhich we destroyed was as we have since learned the moldavia offifteen thousand tons one of their finest vessels but about halfpastthree we blew up the cusco of eight thousand of the same line alsofrom eastern ports and laden with corn</s>  why she came on in face of thewireless messages which must have warned her of danger i cannot imagine</s> the other two steamers which we blew up that day the maid of athensrobson line and the cormorant were neither of them provided withapparatus and came blindly to their destruction</s>  both were small boatsof from five thousand to seven thousand tons</s>  in the case of the secondi had to rise to the surface and fire six twelvepound shells under herwaterline before she would sink</s>  in each case the crew took to theboats and so far as i know no casualties occurred</s> after that no more steamers came along nor did i expect them</s>  warningsmust by this time have been flying in all directions</s>  but we had noreason to be dissatisfied with our first day</s>  between the maplin sandsand the nore we had sunk five ships of a total tonnage of about fiftythousand tons</s>  already the london markets would begin to feel the pinch</s> and lloydspoor old lloydswhat a demented state it would be in</s>  icould imagine the london evening papers and the howling in fleet street</s> we saw the result of our actions for it was quite laughable to see thetorpedoboats buzzing like angry wasps out of sheerness in the evening</s> they were darting in every direction across the estuary and theaeroplanes and hydroplanes were like flights of crows black dots againstthe red western sky</s>  they quartered the whole river mouth until theydiscovered us at last</s>  some sharpsighted fellow with a telescope onboard of a destroyer got a sight of our periscope and came for us fullspeed</s>  no doubt he would very gladly have rammed us even if it hadmeant his own destruction but that was not part of our programme at all</s> i sank her and ran her eastsoutheast with an occasional rise</s>  finallywe brought her to not very far from the kentish coast and the searchlights of our pursuers were far on the western skyline</s>  there we layquietly all night for a submarine at night is nothing more than a verythirdrate surface torpedoboat</s>  besides we were all weary and neededrest</s>  do not forget you captains of men when you grease and trim yourpumps and compressors and rotators that the human machine needs sometending also</s> i had put up the wireless mast above the conningtower and had nodifficulty in calling up captain stephan</s>  he was lying he said offventnor and had been unable to reach his station on account of enginetrouble which he had now set right</s>  next morning he proposed to blockthe southampton approach</s>  he had destroyed one large indian boat on hisway down channel</s>  we exchanged good wishes</s>  like myself he neededrest</s>  i was up at four in the morning however and called all hands tooverhaul the boat</s>  she was somewhat up by the head owing to the forwardtorpedoes having been used so we trimmed her by opening the forwardcompensating tank admitting as much water as the torpedoes had weighed</s> we also overhauled the starboard aircompressor and one of the periscopemotors which had been jarred by the shock of the first explosion</s>  we hadhardly got ourselves shipshape when the morning dawned</s> i have no doubt that a good many ships which had taken refuge in thefrench ports at the first alarm had run across and got safely up theriver in the night</s>  of course i could have attacked them but i do notcare to take risksand there are always risks for a submarine at night</s> but one had miscalculated his time and there she was just abreast ofwarden point when the daylight disclosed her to us</s>  in an instant wewere after her</s>  it was a near thing for she was a flier and could dotwo miles to our one but we just reached her as she went swashing by</s> she saw us at the last moment for i attacked her awash since otherwisewe could not have had the pace to reach her</s>  she swung away and thefirst torpedo missed but the second took her full under the counter</s> heavens what a smash</s>  the whole stern seemed to go aloft</s>  i drew offand watched her sink</s>  she went down in seven minutes leaving her mastsand funnels over the water and a cluster of her people holding on tothem</s>  she was the virginia of the bibby linetwelve thousandtonsand laden like the others with foodstuffs from the east</s>  thewhole surface of the sea was covered with the floating grain</s>  john bullwill have to take up a hole or two of his belt if this goes on saidvornal as we watched the scene</s> and it was at that moment that the very worst danger occurred that couldbefall us</s>  i tremble now when i think how our glorious voyage might havebeen nipped in the bud</s>  i had freed the hatch of my tower and waslooking at the boats of the virginia with vornal near me when therewas a swish and a terrific splash in the water beside us which coveredus both with spray</s>  we looked up and you can imagine our feelings whenwe saw an aeroplane hovering a few hundred feet above us like a hawk</s> with its silencer it was perfectly noiseless and had its bomb notfallen into the sea we should never have known what had destroyed us</s>  shewas circling round in the hope of dropping a second one but we shoved onall speed ahead crammed down the rudders and vanished into the side ofa roller</s>  i kept the deflection indicator falling until i had put fiftygood feet of water between the aeroplane and ourselves for i knew wellhow deeply they can see under the surface</s>  however we soon threw heroff our track and when we came to the surface near margate there was nosign of her unless she was one of several which we saw hovering overherne bay</s> there was not a ship in the offing save a few small coasters and littlethousandton steamers which were beneath my notice</s>  for several hours ilay submerged with a blank periscope</s>  then i had an inspiration</s>  ordershad been marconied to every foodship to lie in french waters and dashacross after dark</s>  i was as sure of it as if they had been recorded inour own receiver</s>  well if they were there that was where i should bealso</s>  i blew out the tanks and rose for there was no sign of anywarship near</s>  they had some good system of signalling from the shorehowever for i had not got to the north foreland before three destroyerscame foaming after me all converging from different directions</s>  theyhad about as good a chance of catching me as three spaniels would have ofovertaking a porpoise</s>  out of pure bravadoi know it was very wrongiwaited until they were actually within gunshot</s>  then i sank and we saweach other no more</s> it is as i have said a shallow sandy coast and submarine navigation isvery difficult</s>  the worst mishap that can befall a boat is to bury itsnose in the side of a sanddrift and be held there</s>  such an accidentmight have been the end of our boat though with our fleuss cylinders andelectric lamps we should have found no difficulty in getting out at theairlock and in walking ashore across the bed of the ocean</s>  as it washowever i was able thanks to our excellent charts to keep the channeland so to gain the open straits</s>  there we rose about midday butobserving a hydroplane at no great distance we sank again for half anhour</s>  when we came up for the second time all was peaceful around usand the english coast was lining the whole western horizon</s>  we keptoutside the goodwins and straight down channel until we saw a line ofblack dots in front of us which i knew to be the dovercalais torpedoboat cordon</s>  when two miles distant we dived and came up again sevenmiles to the southwest without one of them dreaming that we had beenwithin thirty feet of their keels</s> when we rose a large steamer flying the german flag was within half amile of us</s>  it was the north german lloyd altona from new york tobremen</s>  i raised our whole hull and dipped our flag to her</s>  it wasamusing to see the amazement of her people at what they must haveregarded as our unparalleled impudence in those englishswept waters</s> they cheered us heartily and the tricolour flag was dipped in greetingas they went roaring past us</s>  then i stood in to the french coast</s> it was exactly as i had expected</s>  there were three great britishsteamers lying at anchor in boulogne outer harbour</s>  they were thecaesar the king of the east and the pathfinder none less thanten thousand tons</s>  i suppose they thought they were safe in frenchwaters but what did i care about threemile limits and internationallaw</s>  the view of my government was that england was blockaded foodcontraband and vessels carrying it to be destroyed</s>  the lawyers couldargue about it afterwards</s>  my business was to starve the enemy any way icould</s>  within an hour the three ships were under the waves and theiota was streaming down the picardy coast looking for fresh victims</s> the channel was covered with english torpedoboats buzzing and whirlinglike a cloud of midges</s>  how they thought they could hurt me i cannotimagine unless by accident i were to come up underneath one of them</s> more dangerous were the aeroplanes which circled here and there</s> the water being calm i had several times to descend as deep as a hundredfeet before i was sure that i was out of their sight</s>  after i had blownup the three ships at boulogne i saw two aeroplanes flying down channeland i knew that they would head off any vessels which were coming up</s> there was one very large white steamer lying off havre but she steamedwest before i could reach her</s>  i dare say stephan or one of the otherswould get her before long</s>  but those infernal aeroplanes spoiled oursport for that day</s>  not another steamer did i see save the neverendingtorpedoboats</s>  i consoled myself with the reflection however that nofood was passing me on its way to london</s>  that was what i was there forafter all</s>  if i could do it without spending my torpedoes all thebetter</s>  up to date i had fired ten of them and sunk nine steamers so ihad not wasted my weapons</s>  that night i came back to the kent coast andlay upon the bottom in shallow water near dungeness</s> we were all trimmed and ready at the first break of day for i expectedto catch some ships which had tried to make the thames in the darknessand had miscalculated their time</s>  sure enough there was a great steamercoming up channel and flying the american flag</s>  it was all the same tome what flag she flew so long as she was engaged in conveying contrabandof war to the british isles</s>  there were no torpedoboats about at themoment so i ran out on the surface and fired a shot across her bows</s>  sheseemed inclined to go on so i put a second one just above her waterlineon her port bow</s>  she stopped then and a very angry man began togesticulate from the bridge</s>  i ran the iota almost alongside</s> are you the captain</s>  i asked</s> what the i wont attempt to reproduce his language</s> you have foodstuffs on board</s>  i said</s> its an american ship you blind beetle</s>  he cried</s>  cant you see theflag</s>  its the vermondia of boston</s> sorry captain i answered</s>  i have really no time for words</s>  thoseshots of mine will bring the torpedoboats and i dare say at this verymoment your wireless is making trouble for me</s>  get your people into theboats</s> i had to show him i was not bluffing so i drew off and began puttingshells into him just on the waterline</s>  when i had knocked six holes init he was very busy on his boats</s>  i fired twenty shots altogether andno torpedo was needed for she was lying over with a terrible list toport and presently came right on to her side</s>  there she lay for two orthree minutes before she foundered</s>  there were eight boats crammed withpeople lying round her when she went down</s>  i believe everybody wassaved but i could not wait to inquire</s>  from all

has rushed enormous stores of food at the public expense into the country</s>  in a very few months the new harvest will have appeared</s>  on the whole we can face the immediate future without undue depression though there remain some causes for anxiety</s>  these will no doubt be energetically handled by this new and efficient government which has taken the place of those discredited politicians who led us into a war without having foreseen how helpless we were against an obvious form of attack</s>  already the lines of our reconstruction are evident</s>  the first and most important is that our party men realize that there is something more vital than their academic disputes about free trade or protection and that all theory must give way to the fact that a country is in an artificial and dangerous condition if she does not produce within her own borders sufficient food to at least keep life in her population</s>  whether this should be brought about by a tax upon foreign foodstuffs or by a bounty upon home products or by a combination of the two is now under discussion</s>  but all parties are combined upon the principle and though it will undoubtedly entail either a rise in prices or a deterioration in quality in the food of the workingclasses they will at least be insured against so terrible a visitation as that which is fresh in our memories</s>  at any rate we have got past the stage of argument</s>  it must be so</s>  the increased prosperity of the farming interest and as we will hope the cessation of agricultural emigration will be benefits to be counted against the obvious disadvantages</s>  the second lesson is the immediate construction of not one but two doublelined railways under the channel</s>  we stand in a white sheet over the matter since the project has always been discouraged in these columns but we are prepared to admit that had such railway communication been combined with adequate arrangements for forwarding supplies from marseilles we should have avoided our recent surrender</s>  we still insist that we cannot trust entirely to a tunnel since our enemy might have allies in the mediterranean but in a single contest with any power of the north of europe it would certainly be of inestimable benefit</s>  there may be dangers attendant upon the existence of a tunnel but it must now be admitted that they are trivial compared to those which come from its absence</s>

lit his pipe he sat at his desk with his blank notepaper in front of him lost in a deep reverie</s> suddenly his thoughts were brought back to the present</s>  from behind thelaurels of the curving

yellowmoustached young man at the wheel</s>  sir henrysprang to his feet at the sight and then sat down once more</s>  he roseagain as a minute later the footman announced mr</s>  ronald barker</s>  it wasan early visit but barker was sir henrys intimate friend</s>  as each wasa fine shot horseman and billiardplayer there was much in commonbetween the two men and the younger and poorer was in the

whats up</s>  if you aregoing over to lewes we could motor together</s> but the younger mans demeanour was peculiar and ungracious</s>  hedisregarded the hand which was held out to him and he stood

neither surprise norresentment</s>  not a muscle twitched upon his calm set face</s> why do you say that i robbed you last night</s> a big tall fellow in a motorcar stopped me on the mayfield road</s>  hepoked a pistol in my face and took my purse and my watch</s>

was only a single critical passage in it and it was one which hehad written with a sense both of journalistic and of democraticsatisfaction</s>  in it he had sketched off the lofty obsequiousness of

way</s> i had halfturned my monoplane that i might look after this beautifulcreature when in a moment i found myself amidst a perfect fleet ofthem of all sizes but none so large as the first</s>  some were quitesmall but the majority about as big as an average balloon and with muchthe same curvature at the top</s>  there was in them a delicacy of textureand colouring which reminded me of the finest venetian glass</s>  paleshades of pink and green were the prevailing tints but all had a lovelyiridescence where the sun shimmered through their dainty forms</s>  somehundreds of them drifted past me

impression of a definite organism</s>  one of them whisked past myvery face and i was conscious of a cold clammy contact but theircomposition was so unsubstantial that i could not connect them with

a more terrible experience was in store for me</s>  floating downwardsfrom a great height there came a purplish patch of vapour small as i sawit first but rapidly enlarging as it approached me until it appeared tobe hundreds of square feet in size</s>  though fashioned of sometransparent jellylike substance it was none the less of much moredefinite outline and solid consistence than anything which i had seenbefore</s>  there were more traces too of a physical organizationespecially two vast shadowy circular plates upon either side which mayhave been eyes and a perfectly solid white projection between them whichwas as curved and cruel as the beak of a vulture</s> the whole aspect of this monster was formidable and threatening and itkept changing its colour from a very light mauve to a dark angry purpleso thick that it cast a shadow as it drifted between my monoplane and thesun</s>  on the upper curve of its huge body there were three greatprojections which i can only describe as enormous bubbles and i wasconvinced as i looked at them that they were charged with some extremelylight gas which served to buoyup the misshapen and semisolid mass inthe rarefied air</s>  the creature moved swiftly along keeping pace easilywith the monoplane and for twenty miles or more it formed my horribleescort hovering over me like a bird of prey which is waiting to pounce</s> its method of progressiondone so swiftly that it was not easy tofollowwas to throw out a long glutinous streamer in front of it whichin turn seemed to draw forward the rest of the writhing body</s>  so elasticand gelatinous was it that never for two successive minutes was it thesame shape and yet each change made it more threatening and loathsomethan the last</s> i knew that it meant mischief</s>  every purple flush of its hideous bodytold me so</s>  the vague goggling eyes which were turned always upon mewere cold and merciless in their viscid hatred</s>  i dipped the nose of mymonoplane downwards to escape it</s>  as i did so as quick as a flash thereshot out a long tentacle from this mass of floating blubber and it fellas light and sinuous as a whiplash across the front of my machine</s>  therewas a loud hiss as it lay for a moment across the hot engine and itwhisked itself into the air again while the huge flat body drew itselftogether as if in sudden pain</s>  i dipped to a volpique but again atentacle fell over the monoplane and was shorn off by the propeller aseasily as it might have cut through a smoke wreath</s>  a long glidingsticky serpentlike coil came from behind and caught me round the waistdragging me out of the fuselage</s>  i tore at it my fingers sinking intothe smooth gluelike surface and for an instant i disengaged myselfbut only to be caught round the boot by another coil which gave me ajerk that tilted me almost on to my back</s> as i fell over i blazed off both barrels of my gun though indeed itwas like attacking an elephant with a peashooter to imagine that anyhuman weapon could cripple that mighty bulk</s>  and yet i aimed better thani knew for with a loud report one of the great blisters upon thecreatures back exploded with the puncture of the buckshot</s>  it was veryclear that my conjecture was right and that these vast clear bladderswere distended with some lifting gas for in an instant the huge cloudlike body turned sideways writhing desperately to find its balancewhile the white beak snapped and gaped in horrible fury</s>  but already ihad shot away on the steepest glide that i dared to attempt my enginestill

boxing lessons before leaving london so it seemed to me that if ishould chance to meet some traveller whose size and age seemed such as toencourage the venture i would ask him to strip off his coat

said the maidenfrom the dingle</s> by this time i was able to straighten myself up by the aid of the oakenbar which formed the top of the stile</s>  having quoted a few lines of thechinese poet

carriage i took paper from my pocket and i began to writeupon the paper all that had occurred to me in order that i might showthat it was not easy in these days to follow the example of the master</s>

night wore on the air within my littlecabin became closer and more oppressive</s>  a weight seemed to rest upon mybrow and my chest</s>  from far away the low rumble of thunder came moaningover the moor</s>  unable to sleep i dressed and standing at my cottagedoor looked on the black solitude which surrounded me</s> taking the narrow sheep path which ran by this stream i strolled alongit for some hundred yards and had turned to retrace my steps when themoon was finally buried beneath an inkblack cloud and the darknessdeepened so suddenly that i could see neither the path at my feet

figure</s>  itwas sheeva cameron the woman whom i thought i had for ever left</s>  foran instant i stood petrified marvelling whether this could indeed beshe or whether it was some figment conjured up

wail of the owl</s>  a second flashilluminated the landscape and the moon burst out from behind its cloud</s> but i could not though i climbed upon a knoll which overlooked the wholemoor see any sign of this strange midnight wanderer</s>  for an hour ormore i traversed the fell and at last found myself back at my littlecabin still uncertain as to whether it had been a woman or a shadow uponwhich i gazed</s> iiiof the grey cottage in the glenit was either on the fourth or the fifth day after i had taken possessionof my cottage that i was astonished to hear footsteps upon the grassoutside quickly followed by a crack as from a stick upon the door</s>  theexplosion of an infernal machine would hardly have surprised ordiscomfited me more</s>  i had hoped to have shaken off all intrusion forever yet here was somebody beating at my door with as little ceremony asif it had been a village alehouse</s>  hot with anger i flung down my bookand withdrew the bolt just as my visitor had raised his

stood in the shimmering sunlight itook in every feature of his face</s>  the large fleshy nose the steadyblue eyes with their thick thatch of overhanging brows the broadforehead all knitted and lined

glance he was a man of breeding and education</s>  i had beenprepared for some wandering shepherd or uncouth tramp but thisapparition fairly disconcerted me</s> you look astonished said he with a smile</s>  did you think then thatyou were the only man in the world with a taste for solitude</s>  you seethat there are other hermits in the wilderness besides yourself</s> do you mean to say that

to follow the beck upward for a mile or so to find my place</s>  haveyou a bolt on the inside of your door</s> yes i answered rather startled at this question</s> keep it bolted then he said</s>  the

stream</s> i was still standing with my hand upon the latch gazing after myunexpected visitor when i became aware of yet another dweller in thewilderness</s>  some distance along the path which the stranger was takingthere lay a great grey boulder and leaning against this was a smallwizened man who stood erect as the other approached and advanced tomeet him</s>  the two talked for a minute or more the taller man noddinghis head frequently in my direction as though describing what had passedbetween us</s>  then they walked on together and disappeared in a dip ofthe fell</s>  presently i saw them ascending once more some rising groundfarther on</s>  my acquaintance had thrown his arm round his elderly friendeither from affection or from a desire to aid him up the steep incline</s> the square burly figure and its shrivelled meagre companion stood outagainst the skyline and turning their faces they looked back at me</s>  atthe sight i slammed the door lest they should be encouraged to return</s> but when i peeped from the window some minutes afterward i perceivedthat they were gone</s> all day i bent over the egyptian papyrus upon which i was engaged butneither the subtle

to hinder me then from walking inthe direction of their dwelling and observing for myself withoutpermitting them to suspect my presence what manner of men they might be</s> doubtless their mode of life would be found to admit of some simple andprosaic explanation</s>  in any case the evening was fine and a walk wouldbe bracing for mind and body</s>  lighting my pipe i set off over the moorsin the direction which they had taken</s> about halfway down a wild glen there stood a small clump of gnarled andstunted oak trees</s>  from behind these a thin dark column of smoke roseinto the still evening air</s>  clearly this marked the position of myneighbours house</s>  trending away to the left i was able to gain theshelter of a line of rocks and so reach a spot from which i couldcommand a

signsof having been constructed for the use of some shepherd but unlikemine no pains had been taken by the tenants to improve and enlarge it</s> two little peeping windows a cracked and weatherbeaten door and adiscoloured barrel for catching the rain water were the only externalobjects from which i might draw deductions as to the dwellers within</s>  yeteven in these there was food for thought for as i drew nearer stillconcealing myself behind the ridge i saw that thick bars of iron coveredthe windows while the old door was slashed and plated with the samemetal</s>  these strange precautions

knees through the gorse and ferns until i waswithin a hundred yards of my neighbours door</s>  there finding that icould not approach nearer without fear of detection i crouched down andset myself to watch</s> i had hardly settled into my hiding place when the door of the cottageswung open and the man who had introduced himself to me as the surgeonof gaster fell came out bareheaded with a spade in his hands</s>  in frontof the door there was a small cultivated patch containing potatoes peasand other forms of green stuff and here he proceeded to busy himselftrimming weeding and arranging singing the while in a powerful thoughnot very musical voice</s>  he was all engrossed in his work with his backto the cottage when there emerged from the halfopen door the sameattenuated creature whom i had seen in the morning</s>  i could perceive nowthat he was a man of sixty wrinkled bent and feeble with sparsegrizzled hair and long colourless face</s>  with a cringing sidelonggait he shuffled toward

him</s>  each made a quick step toward the other asthough in greeting and theneven now i feel the horror of theinstantthe tall man rushed upon and knocked his companion to the earththen whipping up his body ran with great speed over the interveningground and disappeared with his burden into the house</s> case hardened as i was by my varied life the suddenness and violence ofthe thing made me

failing light iapproached near and strained my ears to catch what was passing</s>  i couldhear the high querulous voice of the elder man and the deep roughmonotone of his assailant mixed with a strange metallic jangling andclanking</s>  presently the surgeon came out locked the door behind him andstamped up and down in the twilight pulling at his hair and brandishinghis arms like a man

discovered to be a chemical furnace</s>  by its rich lighti could distinguish a great litter of retorts test tubes and condenserswhich sparkled over the table and threw strange grotesque shadows onthe

week or so after the doings which i have described i was seatedby my window when i perceived something white drifting slowly down thestream</s>  my first thought was that it was a drowning sheep but

i satbreathlessly listening to the eerie sound</s>  it had stopped now at myvery door and was replaced by a panting and gasping as of one who hastravelled fast and far</s> by the flickering light of

approach my shadowy visitant uttered a shrill cry and fled awayacross the fells yelping like a beaten hound</s> tingling with my recent fear i stood at my door peering through thenight with the discordant cry of the fugitives still ringing in my ears</s> at that moment a vivid flash of lightning illuminated the whole landscapeand made it as clear as day</s>  by its light i saw far away upon thehillside two dark figures pursuing each other with extreme rapidityacross the fells</s>  even at that distance the contrast between them forbidall doubt as to their identity</s>  the first was the

remember so well walking down the platform and looking at theilluminated clock at the end which told me that it was halfpast eleven</s> i remember also my wondering whether i could get home before

it is one of the worst hills in england a mile and ahalf long and one in six in places with three fairly sharp curves</s>  mypark gates stand at the very foot of it upon the main london road</s> we were just over the brow of this hill where the grade is steepestwhen the trouble began</s>  i had been on the top speed and wanted to gether on the free but she stuck between gears and i had to get her backon the top again</s>  by this time she was going at a great rate so iclapped on both brakes and one after the other they gave way</s>  i didntmind so much when i felt my footbrake snap but when i put all my weighton my sidebrake and the lever clanged to its full limit without acatch it brought a cold sweat out of me</s>  by this time we were fairlytearing down the slope</s>  the lights were brilliant and i brought herround the first curve all right</s>  then we did the second one though itwas a close shave for the ditch</s>  there was a mile of straight then withthe third curve

should like that to be known</s>  he wasperfectly cool and alert</s>  i had thought at the very beginning of takingthe bank and he read my intention</s> i wouldnt do it sir said he</s>  at this pace

 the wheels were whirring like a high wind and thebig body creaking and groaning with the strain</s>  but the lights werebrilliant and one could steer to an inch</s>  i remember thinking what anawful and yet majestic sight we should appear to any one who met us</s>  itwas a narrow road and we were just a great roaring golden death to anyone who came in our path</s> we got round the corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank</s>  ithought we were surely over but after staggering for a moment sherighted and darted onwards</s>  that was the third corner and the last one</s> there was only the park gate now</s>  it was facing us but as luck wouldhave it not facing us directly</s>  it was about twenty yards to the leftup the main road into which we ran</s>  perhaps i could have done it but iexpect that the steeringgear had been jarred when we ran on the bank</s> the wheel did not turn easily</s>  we shot out of the lane</s>  i saw the opengate on the left</s>  i whirled round my wheel with all the strength of mywrists</s>  perkins and i threw our bodies across and then the nextinstant going at fifty miles an hour my right front wheel struck fullon the righthand pillar of my own gate</s>

prisoner had refused all offers of legalassistance from counsel and was determined to conduct his own defence</s> the case for the crown was ably presented and was generally consideredto be a very

mean you cant understand that</s>  now i am going</s> no no daddy wait a moment</s>  tell us about bonner and the big catch</s> oh you know about that</s> two little coaxing voices came out of the darkness</s> oh please</s>  please</s> i dont know what your mother will say</s>  what was it you asked</s> bonner</s> ah bonner</s>  daddy looked out in the gloom and saw green fields andgolden sunlight and great sportsmen long gone to their rest</s>  bonnerwas a wonderful man</s>  he was a giant in size</s> as big as you daddy</s> daddy seized his elder boy and shook him playfully</s>  i heard what yousaid to miss cregan the other day</s>  when she asked you what an acre wasyou said about the size of daddy</s> both boys gurgled</s> but bonner was five inches taller than i</s>  he was a giant i tell you</s> did nobody kill him</s> no no dimples</s>  not a storybook giant</s>  but a great strong man</s>  hehad a splendid figure and blue eyes and a golden beard and altogether hewas the finest man i have ever seenexcept perhaps one</s> who was the one daddy</s> well it was the emperor frederick of germany</s> a jarman</s>  cried dimples in horror</s> yes a german</s>  mind you boys a man may be a very noble man and be agermanthough what has become of the noble ones these last three yearsis more than i can guess</s>  but frederick was noble and good as you couldsee on his face</s>  how he ever came to be the father of such a blasphemousbraggartdaddy sank into reverie</s> bonner daddy</s>  said laddie and daddy came back from politics with astart</s>
oh yes bonner</s>  bonner in white flannels on the green sward with anenglish june sun upon him</s>
 that was a picture of a man</s>  but you askedme about the catch</s>  it was in a test match at the ovalengland againstaustralia</s>  bonner said before he went in that he would hit alfred shawinto the next county and he set out to do it</s>  shaw as i have told youcould keep a very good length so for some time bonner could not get theball he wanted but at last he saw his chance and he jumped out and hitthat ball the most awful kerwallop that ever was seen in acricketfield</s> oo</s>  from both boys and then did it go into the next county daddy</s> from dimples</s> well im telling you</s>  said daddy who was always testy when one of hisstories was interrupted</s>  bonner thought he had made the ball a halfvolleythat is the best ball to hitbut shaw had deceived him and theball was really on the short side</s>  so when bonner hit it up and up itwent until it looked as if it were going out of sight into the sky</s> oo</s> at first everybody thought it was going far outside the ground</s>  butsoon they saw that all the giants strength had been wasted in hittingthe ball so high and that there was a chance that it would fall withinthe ropes</s>  the batsmen had run three runs and it was still in the air</s> then it was seen that an english fielder was standing on the very edge ofthe field with his back on the ropes a white figure against the blackline of the people</s>  he stood watching the mighty curve of the ball andtwice he raised his hands together above his head as he did so</s>  then athird time he raised his hands above his head and the ball was in themand bonner was out</s> why did he raise his hands twice</s> i dont know</s>  he did so</s> and who was the fielder daddy</s> the fielder was g</s>  f</s>  grace the younger brother of w</s>  g</s>  only a fewmonths afterwards he was a dead man</s>  but he had one grand moment in hislife with twenty thousand people all just mad with excitement</s>  poor g</s> f</s> </s>  he died too soon</s> did you ever catch a catch like that daddy</s> no boy</s>  i was never a particularly good fielder</s> did you never catch a good catch</s> well i wont say that</s>  you see the best catches are very oftenflukes and i remember one awful fluke of that sort</s> do tell us daddy</s> well dear i was fielding at slip</s>  that is very near the wicket youknow</s>  woodcock was bowling and he had the name of being the fastestbowler of england at that time</s>  it was just the beginning of the matchand the ball was quite red</s>  suddenly i saw something like a red flashand there was the ball stuck in my left hand</s>  i had not time to move it</s> it simply came and stuck</s> oo</s> i saw another catch like that</s>  it was done by ulyett a fine yorkshireplayersuch a big upstanding fellow</s>  he was bowling and thebatsmanit was an australian in a test matchhit as hard as ever hecould</s>  ulyett could not have seen it but he just stuck out his hand andthere was the ball</s> suppose it had hit his body</s> well it would have hurt him</s> would he have cried</s>  from dimples</s> no boy</s>  that is what games are for to teach you to take a knock andnever show it</s>  supposing thata step was heard coming along the passage</s> good gracious boys heres mumty</s>  shut your eyes this moment</s>  itsall right dear</s>  i spoke to them very severely and i think they arenearly asleep</s> what have you been talking about</s>  asked the lady</s> cwicket</s>  cried dimples</s> its natural enough said daddy of course when two boysthree said the lady as she tucked up the little beds</s> iiispeculationsthe three children were sitting together in a bunch upon the rug in thegloaming</s>  baby was talking so daddy behind his newspaper pricked up hisears for the young lady was silent as a rule and every glimpse of herlittle mind was of interest</s>  she was nursing the disreputable littledowny quilt which she called wriggly and much preferred to any of herdolls</s> i wonder if they will let wriggly into heaven she said</s> the boys laughed</s>  they generally laughed at what baby said</s> if they wont i wont go in either she added</s> nor me neither if they dont let in my teddybear said dimples</s> ill tell them it is a nice clean blue wriggly said baby</s>  i lovemy wriggly</s>  she cooed over it and hugged it</s> what about that daddy</s>  asked laddie in his earnest fashion</s>  arethere toys in heaven do you think</s> of course there are</s>  everything that can make children happy</s> as many toys as in hamleys shop</s>  asked dimples</s> more said daddy stoutly</s> oo</s>  from all three</s> daddy dear said laddie</s>  ive been wondering about the deluge</s> yes dear</s>  what was it</s> well the story about the ark</s>  all those animals were in the ark justtwo of each for forty days</s>  wasnt that so</s> that is the story</s> well then what did the carnivorous animals eat</s> one should be honest with children and not put them off with ridiculousexplanations</s>  their questions about such matters are generally much moresensible than their parents replies</s> well dear said daddy weighing his words these stories are veryvery old</s>  the jews put them in the bible but they got them from thepeople in babylon and the people in babylon probably got them from someone else away back in the beginning of things</s>  if a story gets passeddown like that one person adds a little and another adds a little andso you never get things quite as they happened</s>  the jews put it in thebible exactly as they heard it but it had been going about for thousandsof years before then</s> so it was not true</s> yes i think it was true</s>  i think there was a great flood and i thinkthat some people did escape and that they saved their beasts just as weshould try to save nigger and the monkstown cocks and hens if we wereflooded out</s>  then they were able to start again when the waters wentdown and they were naturally very grateful to god for their escape</s> what did the people who didnt escape think about it</s> well we cant tell that</s> they wouldnt be very grateful would they</s> their time was come said daddy who was a bit of a fatalist</s>  iexpect it was the best thing</s> it was jolly hard luck on noah being swallowed by a fish after all histrouble said dimples</s> silly ass</s>  it was jonah that was swallowed</s>  was it a whale daddy</s> a whale</s>  why a whale couldnt swallow a herring</s> a shark then</s> well there again you have an old story which has got twisted and turneda good deal</s>  no doubt he was a holy man who had some great escape atsea and then the sailors and others who admired him invented thiswonder</s> daddy said dimples suddenly should we do just the same as jesusdid</s> yes dear he was the noblest person that ever lived</s> well did jesus lie down every day from twelve to one</s> i dont know that he did</s> well then i wont lie down from twelve to one</s> if jesus had been a growing boy and had been ordered to lie down by hismumty and the doctor i am sure he would have done so</s> did he take malt extract</s> he did what he was told my soni am sure of that</s>  he was a good manso he must have been a good boyperfect in all he did</s> baby saw god yesterday remarked laddie casually</s> daddy dropped his paper</s> yes we made up our minds we would all lie on our backs and stare at thesky until we saw god</s>  so we put the big rug on the lawn and then we alllay down side by side and stared and stared</s>  i saw nothing and dimplessaw nothing but baby says she saw god</s> baby nodded in her wise way</s> i saw him she said</s> what was he like then</s> oh just god</s> she would say no more but hugged her wriggly</s> the lady had entered and listened with some trepidation to the frankaudacity of the childrens views</s>  yet the very essence of faith was inthat audacity</s>  it was all so unquestionably real</s> which is strongest daddy god or the devil</s>  it was laddie who wasspeculating now</s> why god rules everything of course</s> then why doesnt he kill the devil</s> and scalp him</s>  added dimples</s> that would stop all trouble wouldnt it daddy</s> poor daddy was rather floored</s>  the lady came to his help</s> if everything was good and easy in this world then there would benothing to fight against and so laddie our characters would neverimprove</s> it would be like a football match with all the players on one sidesaid daddy</s> if there was nothing bad then nothing would be good for you wouldhave nothing to compare by added the lady</s> well then said laddie with the remorseless logic of childhood ifthat is so then the devil is very useful so he cant be so very badafter all</s> well i dont see that daddy answered</s>  our army can only show howbrave it is by fighting the german emperor but that does not prove thatthe german emperor is a very nice person does it now</s> besides daddy continued improving the occasion you must not thinkof the devil as a person</s>  you must think of all the mean things onecould do and all the dirty things and all the cruel things and that isreally the devil you are fighting against</s>  you couldnt call themuseful could you</s> the children thought over this for a little</s> daddy said laddie have you ever seen god</s> no my boy</s>  but i see his works</s>  i expect that is as near as we canget in this world</s>  look at all the stars at night and think of thepower that made them and keeps each in its proper place</s> he couldnt keep the shooting stars in their proper place saiddimples</s> i expect he meant them to shoot said laddie</s> suppose they all shot what jolly nights we should have</s>  cried dimples</s> yes said laddie but after one night they would all have gone and anice thing then</s> well theres always the moon remarked dimples</s>  but daddy is ittrue that god listens to all we say</s> i dont know about that daddy answered cautiously</s>  you never knowinto what trap those quick little wits may lead you</s>  the lady was morerash or more orthodox</s> yes dear he does hear all you say</s> is he listenin now</s> yes dear</s> well i call it vewy rude of him</s> daddy smiled and the lady gasped</s> it isnt rude said laddie</s>  it is his duty and he has to noticewhat you are doing and saying</s>  daddy did you ever see a fairy</s> no boy</s> i saw one once</s> laddie is the very soul of truth quite painfully truthful in details sothat his quiet remark caused attention</s> tell us about it dear</s> he described it with as little emotion as if it were a persian cat</s> perhaps his perfect faith had indeed opened something to his vision</s> it was in the day nursery</s>  there was a stool by the window</s>  the fairyjumped on the stool and then down and went across the room</s> what was it dressed like</s> all in grey with a long cloak</s>  it was about as big as babys doll</s>  icould not see its arms for they were under the cloak</s> did he look at you</s> no he was sideways and i never really saw his face</s>  he had a littlecap</s>  thats the only fairy i ever saw</s>  of course there was fatherchristmas if you call him a fairy</s> daddy was father christmas killed in the war</s> no boy</s> because he has never come since the war began</s>  i expect he is fightinthe jarmans</s>  it was dimples who was talking</s> last time he came said laddie daddy said one of his reindeers hadhurt its leg in the ruts of the monkstown lane</s>  perhaps thats why henever comes</s> hell come all right after the war said daddy and hell be redderand whiter and jollier than ever</s>  then daddy clouded suddenly for hethought of all those who would be missing when father christmas cameagain</s>  ten loved ones were dead from that one household</s>  the lady putout her hand for she always knew what daddy was thinking</s> they will be there in spirit dear</s> yes and the jolliest of the lot said daddy stoutly</s>  well have ourfather christmas back and all will be well in england</s> but what do they do in india</s>  asked laddie</s> why whats wrong with them</s> how do the sledge and the reindeer get across the sea</s>  all the parcelsmust get wet</s> yes dear there have been several complaints said daddy gravely</s> halloa heres nurse</s>  times up</s>  off to bed</s> they got up resignedly for they were really very good children</s>  sayyour prayers here before you go said the lady</s>  the three littlefigures all knelt on the rug baby still cuddling her wriggly</s> you pray laddie and the rest can join in</s> god bless every one i love said the high clear childvoice</s>  andmake me a good boy and thank you so much for all the blessings of today</s>  and please take care of alleyne who is fighting the

dimples</s> amen</s>  said daddy</s>  and the little figures rose for the goodnight kiss</s> ivthe leatherskin tribedaddy</s>  said the elder boy</s>  have you seen wild indians</s> yes boy</s> have you ever scalped one</s> good gracious no</s> has one ever scalped you</s>  asked dimples</s> silly</s>  said laddie</s>  if daddy had been scalped he wouldnt have allthat hair on his headunless perhaps it grew again</s> he has none hair on the very top said dimples hovering over the lowchair in which daddy was sitting</s> they didnt scalp you did they daddy</s>  asked laddie with someanxiety</s> i expect nature will scalp me some of these days</s> both boys were keenly interested</s>  nature presented itself as some rivalchief</s> when</s>  asked dimples eagerly with the evident intention of beingpresent</s> daddy passed his fingers ruefully through his thinning locks</s>  prettysoon i expect said he</s> oo</s>  said the three children</s>  laddie was resentful and defiant but thetwo younger ones were obviously delighted</s> but i say daddy you said we should have an indian game after tea</s>  yousaid it when you wanted us to be so quiet after breakfast</s>  you promisedyou know</s> it doesnt do to break a promise to children</s>  daddy rose somewhatwearily from his comfortable chair and put his pipe on the mantelpiece</s> first he held a conference in secret with uncle pat the most ingeniousof playmates</s>  then he returned to the children</s>  collect the tribesaid he</s>  there is a council in a quarter of an hour in the big room</s> put on your indian dresses and arm yourselves</s>  the great chief will bethere</s> sure enough when he entered the big room a quarter of an hour later thetribe of the leatherskins had assembled</s>  there were four of them forlittle rosy cousin john from next door always came in for an indian game</s> they had all indian dresses with high feathers and wooden clubs ortomahawks</s>  daddy was in his usual untidy tweeds but carried a rifle</s>  hewas very serious when he entered the room for one should be very seriousin a real good indian game</s>  then he raised his rifle slowly over hishead in greeting and the four childish voices rang out in the warcry</s>  itwas a prolonged wolfish howl which dimples had been known to offer toteach elderly ladies in hotel corridors</s>  you cant be in our tribewithout it you know</s>  there is none body about</s>  now just try once ifyou can do it</s>  at this moment there are halfadozen elderly peoplewandering about england who have been made children once more by laddieand dimples</s> hail to the tribe</s>  cried daddy</s> hail chief</s>  answered the voices</s> red buffalo</s> here</s>  cried laddie</s> black bear</s> here</s>  cried dimples</s> white butterfly</s> go on you silly squaw</s>  growled dimples</s> here said baby</s> prairie wolf</s> here said little fouryearold john</s> the muster is complete</s>  make a circle round the campfire and we shalldrink the firewater of the palefaces and smoke the pipe of peace</s> that was a fearsome joy</s>  the firewater was gingerale drunk out of thebottle which was gravely passed from hand to hand</s>  at no other time hadthey ever drunk like that and it made an occasion of it which wasincreased by the owlish gravity of daddy</s>  then he lit his pipe and itwas passed also from one tiny hand to another laddie taking a heartysuck at it which set him coughing while baby only touched the end ofthe amber with her little pink lips</s>  there was dead silence until it hadgone round and returned to its owner</s> warriors of the leatherskins why have we come here</s>  asked daddyfingering his rifle</s> humpty dumpty said little john and the children all began to laughbut the portentous gravity of daddy brought them back to the warriormood</s> the prairie wolf has spoken truly said daddy</s>  a wicked palefacecalled humpty dumpty has taken the prairies which once belonged to theleatherskins and is now camped upon them and hunting our buffaloes</s>  whatshall be his fate</s>  let each warrior speak in turn</s> tell him he has jolly well got to clear out said laddie</s> thats not indian talk cried dimples with all his soul in the game</s> kill him great chiefhim and his squaw too</s>  the two youngerwarriors merely laughed and little john repeated humpty dumpty</s> quite right</s>  remember the villains name</s>  said daddy</s>  now then thewhole tribe follows me on the wartrail and we shall teach this palefaceto shoot our buffaloes</s> look here we dont want squaws cried dimples as baby toddled at therear of the procession</s>  you stay in the wigwam and cook</s> a piteous cry greeted the suggestion</s> the white butterfly will come with us and bind up the wounds saiddaddy</s> the squaws are jolly good as torturers remarked laddie</s> really daddy this strikes me as a most immoral game said the ladywho had been a sympathetic spectator from a corner doubtful of thegingerale horrified at the pipe and delighted at the completeabsorption of the children</s> rather</s>  said the great chief with a sad relapse into the normal</s>  isuppose that is why they love it so</s>  now then warriors we go forth onthe wartrail</s>  one whoop all together before we start</s>  capital</s>  followme now one behind the other</s>  not a sound</s>  if one gets separated fromthe others let him give the cry of a night owl and the others will answerwith the squeak of the prairie lizard</s> what sort of a squeak please</s> oh any old squeak will do</s>  you dont walk</s>  indians trot on the warpath</s>  if you see any man hiding in a bush kill him at once but dontstop to scalp himreally dear</s>  from the corner</s> the great queen would rather that you scalp him</s>  now then</s>  all ready</s> start</s> away went the line of figures daddy stooping with his rifle at thetrail laddie and dimples armed with axes and toy pistols as tense andserious as any redskins could be</s>  the other two rather moreirresponsible but very much absorbed all the same</s>  the little line ofabsurd figures wound in and out of the furniture and out on to the lawnand round the laurel bushes and into the yard and back to the clump oftrees</s>  there daddy stopped and held up his hand with a face that frozethe children</s> are all here</s>  he asked</s>
hush warriors</s>  no sound</s>  there is an enemy scout in the bushes ahead</s> stay with me you two</s>  you red buffalo and you black bear crawlforward and settle him</s>  see that he makes no sound</s>  what you do must bequick and sudden</s>  when all is clear give the cry of the woodpigeon andwe will join you</s> the two warriors crawled off in most desperate earnest</s>  daddy leaned onhis gun and winked at the lady who still hovered fearfully in thebackground like a dear hen whose chickens were doing wonderful andunaccountable things</s>  the two younger indians slapped each other andgiggled</s>  presently there came the coo of a woodpigeon from in front</s> daddy and the tribe moved forward to where the advance guard were waitingin the bushes</s> great chief we could find no scout said laddie</s> there was none person to kill added dimples</s> the chief was not surprised since the scout had been entirely of his owninvention</s>  it would not do to admit it however</s> have you found his trail</s>  he asked</s> no chief</s> let me look</s>  daddy hunted about with a look of preternatural sagacityabout him</s>  before the snows fell a man passed here with a red headgrey clothes and a squint in his left eye</s>  his trail shows that hisbrother has a grocers shop and his wife smokes cigarettes on the sly</s> oh daddy how could you read all that</s> its easy enough my son when you get the knack of it</s>  but look herewe are indians on the wartrail and dont you forget it if you valueyour scalp</s>  aha here is humpty dumptys trail</s> uncle pat had laid down a paper trail from this point as daddy wellknew so now the children were off like a little pack of eager harriersfollowing in and out among the bushes</s>  presently they had a rest</s> great chief why does a wicked paleface leave paper wherever he goes</s> daddy made a great effort</s> he tears up the wicked letters he has written</s>  then he writes otherseven wickeder and tears them up in turn</s>  you can see for yourself thathe leaves them wherever he goes</s>  now warriors come along</s> uncle pat had dodged all over the limited garden and the tribe followedhis trail</s>  finally they stopped at a gap in the hedge which leads intothe field</s>  there was a little wooden hut in the field where daddy usedto go and put up a printed cardboard working</s>  he found it a very gooddodge when he wanted a quiet smoke and a nap</s>  usually there was nothingelse in the field but this time the chief pushed the whole tribehurriedly behind the hedge and whispered to them to look carefully outbetween the branches</s> in the middle of the field a tripod of sticks supported a kettle</s>  ateach side of it was a hunchedup figure in a coloured blanket</s>  uncle pathad done his work skilfully and well</s> you must get them before they can reach their rifles said the chief</s> what about their horses</s>  black bear move down the hedge and bring backword about their horses</s>  if you see none give three whistles</s> the whistles were soon heard and the warrior returned</s> if the horses had been there what would you have done</s> scalped them</s>  said dimples</s> silly ass</s>  said laddie</s>  who ever heard of a horses scalp</s>  you wouldstampede them</s> of course said the chief</s>  if ever you see a horse grazing you crawlup to it spring on its back and then gallop away with your head lookingunder its neck and only your foot to be seen</s>  dont you forget it</s>  butwe must scupper these rascals on our huntinggrounds</s> shall we crawl up to them</s> yes crawl up</s>  then when i give a whoop rush them</s>  take them alive</s>  iwish to have a word with them first</s>  carry them into the hut</s>  go</s> away went the eager little figures the chubby babes and the two litheactive boys</s>  daddy stood behind the bush watching them</s>  they kept aline and tiptoed along to the camp of the strangers</s>  then on thechiefs signal they burst into a cry and rushed wildly with wavingweapons into the camp of the palefaces</s>  a moment later the two pillowmade trappers were being dragged off into the hut by the whoopingwarriors</s>  they were upended in one corner when the chief entered andthe victorious indians were dancing about in front of them</s> anybody wounded</s>  asked the chief</s> no no</s> have you tied their hands</s> with perfect gravity red buffalo made movements behind each of thepillows</s> they are tied great chief</s> what shall we do with them</s> cut off their heads</s>  shrieked dimples who was always the mostbloodthirsty of the tribe though in private life he had been known toweep bitterly over a squashed caterpillar</s> the proper thing is to tie them to a stake said laddie</s> what do you mean by killing our buffaloes</s>  asked daddy severely</s> the prisoners preserved a sulky silence</s> shall i shoot the green one</s>  asked dimples presenting his woodenpistol</s> wait a bit</s>  said the chief</s>  we had best keep one as a hostage andsend the other back to say that unless the chief of the palefaces pays aransom within three daysbut at that moment as a great romancer used to say a strange thinghappened</s>  there was the sound of a turning key and the whole tribe ofthe leatherskins was locked into the hut</s>  a moment later a dreadful
