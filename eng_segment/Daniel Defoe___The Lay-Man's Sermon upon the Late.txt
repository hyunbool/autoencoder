some think a general blast follows all the endeavours of this nationagainst the common enemy for their slighting and reproaching theglorious memory of the late king william whose gallant endeavoursfor the general good of europe and of england in particular weretreacherously thwarted and disappointed while he was alive and arebasely and scandalously undervalued and slighted now he is dead andof this sort i confess my self enclined to be one</s> from these general observations we may descend to particulars andevery one judges according to their own fancy</s> some will have it that the slaughter and destruction among the fleetis a judgment upon them for going into the streights and cominghome again without doing any business but those forget that if theydid all they were ordered to do the fault lies in those who sentthem and not in they that went</s> some will have the damage among the colliers to be a judgment uponthose who have engrossd the trade and made the poor pay so dear forcoals not enquiring whether those engrossers of the coals are notleft safe on shore while the poor seamen are drownd who knownothing of the matter</s> tis plain to me who ever are punishd by the storm we that are lefthave a share in the judgment and a trebble concern in the cause</s> if it could be said that those who are destroyd or who have sufferedthe loss of lives limbs or goods were the only people who gave anyoccasion to the divine justice thus severely to revenge it self thenall admonition to the rest of mankind would be useless any fartherthan it directed them to be cautious how they provoked him in likemanner but have we not all had a hand in the general provocationthough not an equal share in the general calamity</s> sometimes the judgements of heaven bear so much analogy to thecrimes that the punishment points out the offence and tis easy todistinguish what it is the perticular hand of justice points at</s> and if we will seek for a perticular case in which heaven seems tohave singled out this way of punishment on the nation as bestproportiond to the general national crime we are all guilty of</s>  whatseems more rational than to judge that tis a severe animadversion uponthe feuds and storms of parties kept up among us in this nation withsuch unnatural heat and such unaccountable fury that no man whohas the least compassion for his native country but must with morethan common grief be concerned for it since unless some speedycourse be taken to bring a general composure upon the minds of menthe general ruin seems inevitable</s> if the matters in debate were of extraordinary consequence theremight be some pretence for espousing contrary parties with unusualheat but while the difference lies in small and in some casesindifferent things tis a most inexcusable madness that the feudsshoud be run up so high that all manner of charity should perish andbe lost among us</s> we have had an extraordinary bustle in the world about moderation andall parties pretend to it and now we are as busy about peace andevery one lays in a loud claim to it</s> i have seen with some regret the strange mysterious management ofthis age about moderation and tho some late authors have publishedthat moderation is a vertue it begins to be a question whether it isor no</s>
i wish some body would make enquiry after the occasion that hasbrought this blessed word into so much contempt in the world tis veryhard that a word expressive of the most glorious principle in theworld should become the brand of reproach and a badge of infamy toparties be a nickname it self and be nicknamd on every side andthat at a time when the vertue it self is perhaps the only thing leftin the world that can preserve this nation from destruction</s> tis too unhappy for england that men of immoderate principles areso powerfull as they are</s>  let the party be which it will tisdestruction even to themselves to run up all their niceties and alltheir scruples to the extremes</s>  every dispute becomes a feud everyspark a flame every word a blow every blow a civilwar and by thisintestine confusion of principles backt with the passion and fury ofmen this unhappy nation is subdivided into an infinite number ofparties factions intrests and seperate opinions</s> every man being thus bent upon the propagation of his own notion forwant of this healing spirit of moderation falls foul upon hisneighbour because he has not the same heat and if he finds himbetter temperd than himself if he finds him less violent lessfurious than himself he is imediately branded with the scandal ofmoderation</s> since then the change of times has made this practice which in itsvery nature is a foundation of vertue become a crime let us examinewho are and who are not guilty of it</s> for the negatives of this vice of moderation they are something easierto be discoverd than ordinary both in principles and in practiceand without the scandal of a censorious writer i may be allowed tosay all the following instances may stand clear of this crime</s> 1</s>  if mr</s>  sachaverell with his bloody flag and banner of defiancewere indicted for moderation i verily believe no jury would bring himin guilty</s>
