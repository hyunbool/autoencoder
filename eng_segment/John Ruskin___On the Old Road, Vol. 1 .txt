twomonths in prison and afterwards conducting him through the publictreasury to teach him that the florentines could build their whole cityof marble and not one poor steeple only were they so inclined</s> giotto made a model of his proposed structure on which every stone wasmarked and the successive courses painted red and white according tohis design so as to match with the cathedral and

that as on the one handinfinite misery is caused by idle people who both fail in doing whatwas appointed for them to do and set in motion various springs ofmischief in matters in which they should have had no concern so on theother hand no small misery is caused by overworked and unhappy peoplein the dark views which they necessarily take up themselves and forceupon others of work itself</s>  were it not so i believe the fact of theirbeing unhappy is in itself a violation of divine law and a sign of somekind of folly or sin in their way of life</s>  now in order that people maybe happy in their work these three things are needed they must be fitfor it they must not do too much of it and they must have a sense ofsuccess in itnot a doubtful sense such as needs some testimony ofother people for its confirmation but a sure sense or ratherknowledge that so much work has been done well and fruitfully donewhatever the world may say or think about it</s>  so that in order that aman may

not the evidence of ease on the very front of all thegreatest works in existence</s>  do they not say plainly to us not therehas been a great effort here but there has been a great powerhere</s>  it

goodfrom the work that he does and is often so little conscious of theinherent divinity in himself that he is very apt to ascribe all hiscapacity to his work and to tell those who ask how he came to

grayish bluewith brown foregrounds some began to be noticed as exhibiting rathermore than ordinary diligence and delicacy signed w</s>  turner</s> 34 therewas nothing however in them at all indicative of genius or even ofmore than ordinary talent unless in some of the subjects a largeperception of space and excessive clearness and decision in thearrangement of masses</s>  gradually and cautiously the blues became mingledwith delicate green and then with gold the browns in the foregroundbecame first more positive and then were slightly mingled with otherlocal colors while the touch which had at first been heavy and brokenlike that of the ordinary drawing masters of the time grew more andmore refined and expressive until it lost itself in a method ofexecution often too delicate for the eye to follow rendering with aprecision before unexampled both the texture and the form of everyobject</s>  the style may be considered as perfectly formed about the year1800 and it remained unchanged for twenty years</s> during that period the painter had attempted and with more or lesssuccess had rendered every order of landscape subject but always onthe same principle subduing the colors of nature into a harmony ofwhich the keynotes are grayish green and brown pure blues anddelicate golden yellows being admitted in small quantity as the lowestand highest limits of shade and light and bright local colors inextremely small quantity in figures or other minor accessories</s> 196</s>  pictures executed on such a system are not properly speakingworks in color at all they are studies of light and shade in whichboth the shade and the distance are rendered in the general hue whichbest expresses their attributes of coolness and transparency and thelights and the foreground are executed in that which best expressestheir warmth and solidity</s>  this advantage may just as well be taken asnot in studies of light and shadow to be executed with the hand butthe use of two three or four colors always in the same relations andplaces does not in the least constitute the work a study of color anymore than the brown engravings of the liber studiorum nor would theidea of color be in general more present to the artists mind when hewas at work on one of these drawings than when he was using pure brownin the mezzotint engraving</s>  but the idea of space warmth and freshnessbeing not successfully expressible in a single tint and perfectlyexpressible by the admission of three or four he allows himself thisadvantage when it is possible without in the least embarrassing himselfwith the actual color of the objects to be represented</s>  a stone in theforeground might in nature have been cold gray but it will be drawnnevertheless of a rich brown because it is in the foreground a hill inthe distance might in nature be purple with heath or golden with furzebut it will be drawn nevertheless of a cool gray because it is in thedistance</s> 197</s>  this at least was the general theorycarried out with greatseverity in many both of the drawings and pictures executed by himduring the period in others more or less modified by the cautiousintroduction of color as the painter felt his liberty increasing forthe system was evidently never considered as final or as anything morethan a means of progress the conventional easily manageable colorwas visibly adopted only that his mind might be at perfect liberty toaddress itself to the acquirement of the first and most necessaryknowledge in all artthat of form</s>  but as form in landscape impliesvast bulk and space the use of the tints which enabled him best toexpress them was actually auxiliary to the mere drawing andtherefore not only permissible but even necessary while morebrilliant or varied tints were never indulged in except when they mightbe introduced without the slightest danger of diverting his mind for aninstant from his principal object</s>  and therefore it will be generallyfound in the works of this period that exactly in proportion to theimportance and general toil of the composition is the severity of thetint and that the play of color begins to show itself first in slightand small drawings where he felt that he could easily secure all thathe wanted in form</s> 198</s>  thus the crossing the brook and such other elaborate and largecompositions are actually painted in nothing but gray brown and bluewith a point or two of severe local color in the figures but in theminor drawings tender passages of complicated color occur notunfrequently in easy places and even before the year 1800 he begins tointroduce it with evident joyfulness and longing in his rude and simplestudies just as a child if it could be supposed to govern itself by afully developed intellect

we not unfrequently find him indulging in the luxury ofa peacock and it is impossible to express the joyfulness with which heseems to design its graceful form and deepen with soft penciling thebloom of its blue after he has worked through the stern detail of hisalmost colorless drawing</s>  a rainbow is another of his most frequentlypermitted indulgences and we find him very early allowing the edges ofhis evening clouds to be touched with soft rosecolor or gold whilewhenever the hues of nature in anywise fall into his system and can becaught without a dangerous departure from it he instantly throws hiswhole soul into the faithful rendering of them</s>  thus the usual browntones of his foreground become warmed into sudden vigor and are variedand enhanced with indescribable delight when he finds himself by theshore of a moorland stream where they truly express the stain of itsgolden rocks and the darkness of its clear cairngormlike pools andthe usual serenity of his arial blue is enriched into the softness anddepth of the sapphire when it can deepen the distant slumber of somehighland lake or temper the gloomy shadows of the evening upon itshills</s> 199</s>  the system of his color being thus simplified he could address allthe strength of his mind to the accumulation of facts of form hischoice of subject and his methods of treatment are therefore asvarious as his color is simple and it is not a little difficult to givethe reader who is unacquainted with his works an idea either of theirinfinitude of aims on the one hand or of the kind of feeling whichpervades them all on the other</s>  no subject was too low or too high forhim we find him one day hard at work on a cock and hen with theirfamily of chickens in a farmyard and bringing all the

his whole mind and carry away his wholeheart nothing so great or solemn but that he can raise himself intoharmony with it and it is impossible to prophesy of him at any momentwhether the next he will be in laughter or in tears</s> 201</s>  this is the root of the mans greatness and it follows as a matterof course that this sympathy must give him a subtle power of expressioneven of the characters of mere material things such as no other painterever possessed</s>  the man who can best feel the difference betweenrudeness and tenderness in humanity perceives also more differencebetween the branches of an oak and a willow than anyone else would andtherefore necessarily the most striking character of the drawingsthemselves is the speciality of whatever they representthe thoroughstiffness of what is stiff and grace of what is graceful and vastnessof what is vast but through and beyond all this the condition of themind of the painter himself is easily enough discoverable by comparisonof a large number of the drawings</s>  it is singularly serene and peacefulin itself quite passionless though entering with ease into the externalpassion which it contemplates</s>  by the effort of its will it sympathizeswith tumult or distress even in their extremes but there is no tumultno sorrow in itself only a chastened and exquisitely peacefulcheerfulness deeply meditative touched without loss of its ownperfect balance by sadness on the one side and stooping to playfulnessupon the other</s>  i shall never cease to regret the destruction by firenow several years ago of a drawing which always seemed to me to be theperfect image of the painters mind at this periodthe drawing ofbrignal church near rokeby of which a feeble idea may still be gatheredfrom the engraving in the yorkshire series</s>  the spectator stands onthe brignal banks looking down into the glen at twilight the sky isstill full of soft rays though the sun is gone and the greta glancesbrightly in the valley singing

air a boys kite incapable ofrising has become entangled in their branches he is climbing torecover it and just behind it in the picture almost indicated by itthe lowly church is seen in its secluded field between the rocks and thestream and around it the low churchyard wall and a few white stoneswhich mark the resting places of those who can climb the rocks no morenor hear the river sing as it passes</s> there are many other existing drawings which indicate the same characterof mind though i think none so touching or so beautiful yet they arenot as i said above more numerous than those which express hissympathy with sublimer or more active scenes but they are almost alwaysmarked by a tenderness of execution and have a look of being beloved inevery part of them which shows them to be the truest expression of hisown feelings</s> 202</s>  one other characteristic of his mind at this period remains to benoticedits reverence for talent in others</s>  not the reverence whichacts upon the practices of men as if they were the laws of nature butthat which is ready to appreciate the power and receive the assistanceof every mind which has been previously employed in the same directionso far as its teaching seems to be consistent with the great textbookof nature itself</s>  turner thus studied almost every preceding landscapepainter chiefly claude poussin vandevelde loutherbourg and wilson</s> it was probably by the sir george beaumonts and other feebleconventionalists of the period that he was persuaded to devote hisattention to the works of these men and his having done so will bethought a few scores of years hence evidence of perhaps the greatestmodesty ever shown by a man of original power</s>  modesty at once admirableand unfortunate for the study of the works of vandevelde and claude wasproductive of unmixed mischief to him he spoiled many of his marinepictures as for instance lord ellesmeres by imitation of the formerand from the latter learned a false ideal which confirmed by thenotions of greek art prevalent in london in the beginning of thiscentury has manifested itself in many vulgarities in his compositionpictures vulgarities which may perhaps be best expressed by the generalterm twickenham classicism as consisting principally in conceptionsof ancient or of rural life such as have influenced the erection of mostof our suburban villas</s>  from nicole poussin and loutherbourg he seems tohave derived advantage perhaps also from wilson and much in hissubsequent travels from far higher men especially tintoret and paulveronese</s>  i have myself heard him speaking with singular delight of theputting in of the beech leaves in the upper righthand corner oftitians peter martyr</s>  i cannot in any of his works trace the slightestinfluence of salvator and i am not surprised at it for though salvatorwas a man of far higher powers than either vandevelde or claude he wasa willful and gross caricaturist</s>  turner would condescend to be helpedby feeble men but could not be corrupted by false men</s>  besides he hadnever himself seen classical life and claude was represented to him ascompetent authority for it</s>  but he had seen mountains and torrentsand knew therefore that salvator could not paint them</s> 203</s>  one of the most characteristic drawings of this period fortunatelybears a date 1818

against the light which by help of aviolent blast of mountain wind has broken through the depth of cloudswhich hang upon the crags</s>  there is no sky properly so called nothingbut this roof of drifting cloud but neither is there any weight ofdarknessthe high air is too thin for itall savage howling andluminous with cold the massy bases of the granite hills jutting outhere and there grimly

arm stretched out against the light of thedistance though too far off for the whip to be seen</s> 204</s>  now i am perfectly certain that anyone thoroughly accustomed to theearlier works of the painter and shown this picture for the first timewould be struck by two altogether new characters in it</s> the first a seeming enjoyment of the excitement of the scene totallydifferent from the contemplative philosophy with which it would formerlyhave been regarded</s>  every incident of motion and of energy is seizedupon with indescribable delight and every line of the compositionanimated with a force and fury which are now no longer the mereexpression of a contemplated external truth but have origin in someinherent feeling in the painters mind</s> the second that although the subject is one in itself almost incapableof color and although in order to increase the wildness of theimpression all brilliant local color has been refused even where itmight easily have been introduced as in the figures yet in the lowminor key which has been chosen the melodies of color have beenelaborated to the utmost possible pitch so as to become a leadinginstead of a subordinate element in the composition the subdued warmhues of the granite promontories the dull stone color of the walls ofthe buildings clearly opposed even in shade to the gray of the snowwreaths heaped against them and the faint greens and ghastly blues ofthe glacier ice being all expressed with delicacies of transitionutterly unexampled in any previous drawings</s> 205</s>  these accordingly are the chief characteristics of the works ofturners second period as distinguished from the firsta new energyinherent in the mind of the painter diminishing the repose and exaltingthe force and fire of his conceptions and the presence of color as atleast an essential and often a principal element of design</s> not that it is impossible or even unusual to find drawings of serenesubject and perfectly quiet feeling among the compositions of thisperiod but the repose is in them just as the energy and tumult were inthe earlier period an external quality which the painter images by aneffort of the will it is no longer a character inherent in himself</s>  theulleswater in the england series is one of those which are in mostperfect peace in the cowes the silence is only broken by the dash ofthe boats oars and in the alnwick by a stag drinking but in atleast nine drawings out of ten either sky water or figures are inrapid motion and the grandest drawings are almost always those whichhave even violent action in one or other or in all e</s> g</s>  high forceof tees coventry llanthony salisbury llanberis and such others</s> 206</s>  the color is however a more absolute distinction and we mustreturn to mr</s>  fawkess collection in order to see how the change in itwas effected</s>  that such a change would take place at one time or otherwas of course to be securely anticipated the conventional system of thefirst period being as above stated merely a means of study</s>  but theimmediate cause was the journey of the year 1820</s>  as might be guessedfrom the legend on the drawing above described passage of mont cenisjanuary 15th 1820 that drawing represents what happened on the day inquestion to the painter himself</s>  he passed the alps then in the winterof 1820 and either in the previous or subsequent summer but on thesame journey he made a series of sketches on the rhine in body colornow in mr</s>  fawkess collection</s>  every one of those sketches is thealmost instantaneous record of an effect of color or atmosphere takenstrictly from nature the drawing and the details of every subject beingcomparatively subordinate and the color nearly as principal as thelight and shade had been beforecertainly the leading feature thoughthe light and shade are always exquisitely harmonized with it</s>  andnaturally as the color becomes the leading object those times of dayare chosen in which it is most lovely and whereas before at least fiveout of six of turners drawings represented ordinary daylight we nowfind his attention directed constantly to the evening and for thefirst time we have those rosy lights upon the hills those gorgeousfalls of sun through flaming heavens those solemn twilights with theblue moon rising as the western sky grows dim which have ever sincebeen the themes of his mightiest thoughts</s> 207</s>  i have no doubt that the immediate reason of this change was theimpression made upon him by the colors of the continental skies</s>  when hefirst traveled on the continent 1800 he was comparatively a youngstudent not yet able to draw form as he wanted he was forced to giveall his thoughts and strength to this primary object</s>  but now he wasfree to receive other impressions the time was come for perfecting hisart and the first sunset which he saw on the rhine taught him that allprevious landscape art was vain and valueless that in comparison withnatural color the things that had been called paintings were mere inkand charcoal and that all precedent and all authority must be cast awayat once and trodden underfoot</s>  he cast them away the memories ofvandevelde and claude were at once weeded out of the great mind they hadencumbered they and all the rubbish of the schools together with themthe waves of the rhine swept them away forever and a new dawn rose overthe rocks of the siebengebirge</s> 208</s>  there was another motive at work which rendered the change stillmore complete</s>  his fellow artists were already conscious enough of hissuperior power in drawing and their best hope was that he might not beable to color</s>  they had begun to express this hope loudly enough for itto reach his ears</s>  the engraver of one of his most important marinepictures told me not long ago that one day about the period inquestion turner came into his room to examine the progress of theplate not having seen his own picture for several months</s>  it was one ofhis dark early pictures but in the foreground was a little piece ofluxury a pearly fish wrought into hues like those of an opal</s>  he stoodbefore the picture for some moments then laughed and pointed joyouslyto the fishthey say that turner cant color</s>  and turned away</s> 209</s>  under the force of these various impulses the change was total</s> every subject thenceforward was primarily conceived in color and noengraving ever gave the slightest idea of any drawing of this period</s> the artists who had any perception of the truth were in despair thebeaumontites classicalists and owl species in general in as muchindignation as their dullness was capable of</s>  they had deliberatelyclosed their eyes to all nature and had gone on inquiring where doyou put your brown tree</s>  a vast revelation was made to them at onceenough to have dazzled anyone but to them light unendurable asincomprehensible</s>  they did to the moon complain in one vociferousunanimous continuous tu whoo</s>  shrieking rose from all dark places atthe same instant just the same kind of shrieking that is now raisedagainst the preraphaelites</s>  those glorious old arabian nights how truethey are</s>  mocking and whispering and abuse loud and low by turns fromall the black stones beside the road when one living soul is toiling upthe hill to get the golden water</s>  mocking and whispering that he maylook back and become a black stone like themselves</s> 210</s>  turner looked not back but he went on in such a temper as a strongman must be in when he is forced to walk with his fingers in his ears</s> he retired into himself he could look no longer for help or counselor sympathy from anyone and the spirit of defiance in which he wasforced to labor led him sometimes into violences from which theslightest expression of sympathy would have saved him</s>  the new energythat was upon him and the utter isolation into which he was drivenwere both alike dangerous and many drawings of the time show the evileffects of both some of them being hasty wild or experimental andothers little more than magnificent expressions of defiance of publicopinion</s> but all have this noble virtuethey are in everything his own thereare no more reminiscences of dead masters no more trials of skill inthe manner of claude or poussin every faculty of his soul is fixed uponnature only as he saw her or as he remembered her</s> 211</s>  i have spoken above of his gigantic memory it is especiallynecessary to notice this in order that we may understand the kind ofgrasp which a man of real imagination takes of all things that are oncebrought within his reachgrasp thenceforth not to be relaxed forever</s> on looking over any catalogues of his works or of particular series ofthem we shall notice the recurrence of the same subject two three oreven many times</s>  in any other artist this would be nothing remarkable</s> probably most modern landscape painters multiply a favorite subjecttwenty thirty or sixty fold putting the shadows and the clouds indifferent places and inventing as they are pleased to call it a neweffect every time</s>  but if we examine the successions of turnerssubjects we shall find them either the records of a succession ofimpressions actually received by him at some favorite locality or elserepetitions of one impression received in early youth and again andagain realized as his increasing powers enabled him to do betterjustice to it</s>  in either case we shall find them records of seenfacts never compositions in his room to fill up a favorite outline</s> 212</s>  for instance every travelerat least every traveler of thirtyyears standingmust love calais the place where he first felt himselfin a strange world</s>  turner evidently loved it excessively</s>  i have nevercatalogued his studies of calais but i remember at this moment fivethere is first the pas de calais a very large oil painting which iswhat he saw in broad daylight as he crossed over when he got near thefrench side</s>  it is a careful study of french fishingboats running forthe shore before the wind with the picturesque old city in thedistance</s>  then there is the calais harbor in the liber studiorum thatis what he saw just as he was going into the harbora heavy brigwarping out and very likely to get in his way or run against the pierand bad weather coming on</s>  then there is the calais pier a largepainting engraved some years ago by mr</s>  lupton37 that is what he sawwhen he had landed and ran back directly to the pier to see what hadbecome of the brig</s>  the weather had got still worse the fishwomen werebeing blown about in a distressful manner on the pier head and somemore fishingboats were running in with all speed</s>  then there is thefortrouge calais that is what he saw after he had been home todesseins and dined and went out again in the evening to walk on thesands the tide being down</s>  he had never seen such a waste of sandsbefore and it made an impression on him</s>  the shrimp girls were allscattered over them too and moved about in white spots on the wildshore and the storm had lulled a little and there was a sunsetsuch asunset</s> and the bars of fortrouge seen against it skeletonwise</s>  hedid not paint that directly thought over itpainted it a long whileafterwards</s> 213</s>  then there is the vignette in the illustrations to scott</s>  that iswhat he saw as he was going home meditatively and the revolvinglighthouse came blazing out upon him suddenly and disturbed him</s>  hedid not like that so much made a vignette of it however when he wasasked to do a bit of calais twenty or thirty years afterwards havingalready done all the rest</s> turner never told me all this but anyone may see it if he will comparethe pictures</s>  they might possibly not be impressions of a single daybut of two days or three though in all human probability they wereseen just as i have stated them38 but they are records ofsuccessive impressions as plainly written as ever travelers diary</s>  allof them pure veracities</s>  therefore immortal</s> 214</s>  i could multiply these series almost indefinitely from the rest ofhis works</s>  what is curious some of them have a kind of private markrunning through all the subjects</s>  thus i know three drawings ofscarborough and all of them have a starfish in the foreground i do notremember any others of his marine subjects which have a starfish</s> the other kind of repetitionthe recurrence to one earlyimpressionis however still more remarkable</s>  in the collection of f</s> h</s>  bale esq</s>  there is a small drawing of llanthony abbey</s>  it is in hisboyish manner its date probably about 1795 evidently a sketch fromnature finished at home</s>  it had been a showery day the hills werepartially concealed by the rain and gleams of sunshine breaking out atintervals</s>  a man was fishing in the mountain stream</s>  the young turnersought a place of some shelter under the bushes made his sketch tookgreat pains when he got home to imitate the rain as he best couldadded his childs luxury of a rainbow put in the very bush under whichhe had taken shelter and the fisherman a somewhat illjointed andlonglegged fisherman in the courtly short breeches which were thefashion of the time</s> 215</s>  some thirty years afterwards with all his powers in theirstrongest training and after the total change in his feelings andprinciples which i have endeavored to describe he undertook the seriesof england and wales and in that series introduced the subject ofllanthony abbey</s>  and behold he went back to his boys sketch and boysthought</s>  he kept the very bushes in their places but brought thefisherman to the other side of the river and put him in somewhat lesscourtly dress under their shelter instead of himself</s>  and then he setall his gained strength and new knowledge at work on the wellrememberedshower of rain that had fallen thirty years before to do it better</s> the resultant drawing39 is one of the very noblest of his secondperiod</s> 216</s>  another of the drawings of the england series ulleswater is therepetition of one in mr</s>  fawkess collection which by the method ofits execution i should conjecture to have been executed about the year1808 or 1810 at all events it is a very quiet drawing of the firstperiod</s>  the lake is quite calm the western hills in gray shadow theeastern massed in light</s>  helvellyn rising like a mist between them allbeing mirrored in the calm water</s>  some thin and slightly evanescent cowsare standing in the shallow water in front a boat floats motionlessabout a hundred yards from the shore the foreground is of broken rockswith some lovely pieces of copse on the right and left</s> this was evidently turners record of a quiet evening by the shore ofulleswater but it was a feeble one</s>  he could not at that time renderthe sunset colors he went back to it therefore in the england seriesand painted it again with his new power</s>  the same hills are there thesame shadows the same cowsthey had stood in his mind on the samespot for twenty yearsthe same boat the same rocks only the copseis cut awayit interfered with the masses of his color</s>  some figuresare introduced bathing and what was gray and feeble gold in the firstdrawing becomes purple and burning rosecolor in the last</s> 217</s>  but perhaps one of the most curious examples is in the series ofsubjects from winchelsea</s>  that in the liber studiorum winchelseasussex bears date 1812 and its figures consist of a soldier speakingto a woman who is resting on the bank beside the road</s>  there is anothersmall subject with winchelsea in the distance of which the engravingbears date 1817</s>  it has two women with bundles and two soldierstoiling along the embankment in the plain and a baggage wagon in thedistance</s>  neither of these seems to have satisfied him and at last hedid another for the england series of which the engraving bears date1830</s>  there is now a regiment on the march the baggage wagon is therehaving got

passages of color orarrangement that have pleased himthe fork of a bough the casting of ashadow the fracture of a stonewill be taken up again and again andstrangely worked into new relations with other thoughts</s>  there is asingle sketch from nature in one of the portfolios at farnley of acommon woodwalk on the estate which has furnished passages to no fewerthan three of the most elaborate compositions in the liber studiorum</s> 219</s>  i am thus tedious in dwelling on turners powers of memory becausei wish it to be thoroughly seen how all his greatness all his infiniteluxuriance of invention depends on his taking possession of everythingthat he seeson his grasping all and losing hold of nothingon hisforgetting himself and forgetting nothing else</s>
 i wish it to beunderstood how every great man paints what he sees or did see hisgreatness being indeed little else than his intense sense of fact</s>  andthus preraphaelitism and raphaelitism and turnerism are all one andthe same so far as education can influence them</s>  they are different intheir choice different in their faculties but all the same in thisthat raphael himself so far as he was great and all who preceded orfollowed him who ever were great became so by painting the truthsaround them as they appeared to each mans own mind not as he had beentaught to see them except by the god who made both him and them</s> 220</s>  there is however one more characteristic of turners secondperiod on which i have still to dwell especially with reference towhat has been above advanced respecting the fallacy of overtoil namelythe magnificent ease with which all is done when it is successfullydone</s>  for there are one or two drawings of this time which are notdone easily</s>  turner had in these set himself to do a fine thing toexhibit his powers in the common phrase to excel himself so sure ashe does this the work is a failure</s>  the worst drawings that have evercome from his hands are some of this second period on which he hasspent much time and laborious thought drawings filled with incidentfrom one side to the other with skies stippled into morbid blue andwarm lights set against them in violent contrast one of bamboroughcastle a large watercolor may be named as an example</s>  but the trulynoble works are those in which without effort he has expressed histhoughts as they came and forgotten himself and in these theoutpouring of invention is not less miraculous than the swiftness andobedience of the mighty hand that expresses it</s>  anyone who examines thedrawings may see the evidence of this facility in the strange freshnessand sharpness of every touch of color but when the multitude ofdelicate touches with which all the arial tones are worked is takeninto consideration it would still appear impossible that the drawingcould have been completed with ease unless we had direct evidence onthe matter fortunately it is not wanting</s>  there is a drawing in mr</s> fawkess collection of a manofwar taking in stores it is of the usualsize of those of the england series about sixteen inches by eleven itdoes not appear one of the most highly finished but it is still fartherremoved from slightness</s>  the hull of a firstrate occupies nearlyonehalf of the picture on the right her bows towards the spectatorseen in sharp perspective from stem to stern with all her portholesguns anchors and lower rigging elaborately detailed there are twoother ships of the line in the middle distance drawn with equalprecision a noble breezy sea dancing against their broad bows full ofdelicate drawing in its waves a storeship beneath the hull of thelarger vessel and several other boats and a complicated cloudy sky</s>  itmight appear no small exertion of mind to draw the detail of all thisshipping down to the smallest ropes from memory in the drawingroom ofa mansion in the middle of yorkshire even if considerable time had beengiven for the effort</s>  but mr</s>  fawkes sat beside the painter from thefirst stroke to the last</s>  turner took a piece of blank paper one morningafter breakfast outlined his ships finished the drawing in threehours and went out to shoot</s> 221</s>  let this single fact be quietly meditated upon by our ordinarypainters and they will see the truth of what was above assertedthatif a great thing can be done at all it can be done easily and let themnot torment themselves with twisting of compositions this way and thatand repeating and experimenting and sceneshifting</s>  if a man cancompose at all he can compose at once or rather he must compose inspite of himself</s>  and this is the reason of that silence which i havekept in most of my works on the subject of composition</s>  many criticsespecially the architects have found fault with me for not teachingpeople how to arrange masses for not attributing sufficientimportance to composition</s>  alas</s>  i attribute far more importance to itthan they doso much importance that i should just as soon think ofsitting down to teach a man how to write a divina commedia or kinglear as how to compose in the true sense a single building orpicture</s>  the marvelous stupidity of this age of lecturers is that theydo not see that what they call principles of composition are mereprinciples of common sense in everything as well as in pictures andbuildingsa picture is to have a principal light</s>  yes and so a dinneris to have a principal dish and an oration a principal point and anair of music a principal note and every man a principal object</s>  apicture is to have harmony of relation among its parts</s>  yes and so is aspeech well uttered and an action well ordered and a company wellchosen and a ragout well mixed</s>  composition</s>  as if a man were notcomposing every moment of his life well or ill and would not do itinstinctively in his picture as well as elsewhere if he could</s> composition of this lower or common kind is of exactly the sameimportance in a picture that it is in anything elseno more</s>  it iswell that a man should say what he has to say in good order andsequence but the main thing is to say it truly</s>  and yet we go onpreaching to our pupils as if to have a principal light was everythingand so cover our academy walls with shacabac feasts wherein the coursesare indeed well ordered but the dishes empty</s> 222</s>  it is not however only in invention that men overwork themselvesbut in execution also and here i have a word to say to thepreraphaelites specially</s>  they are working too hard</s>  there is evidencein failing portions of their pictures showing that they have wrought solong upon them that their very sight has failed for weariness and thatthe hand refused any more to obey the heart</s>  and besides this thereare certain qualities of drawing which they miss from overcarefulness</s> for let them be assured there is a great truth lurking in that commondesire of men to see things done in what they call a masterly orbold or broad manner a truth oppressed and abused like almostevery other in this world but an eternal one nevertheless and whatevermischief may have followed from mens looking for nothing else but thisfacility of execution and supposing that a picture was assuredly allright if only it were done with broad dashes of the brush still thetruth remains the samethat because it is not intended that men shalltorment or weary themselves with any earthly labor it is appointed thatthe noblest results should only be attainable by a certain ease anddecision of manipulation</s>  i only wish people understood this much ofsculpture as well as of painting and could see that the finelyfinished statue is in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a far morevulgar work than that which shows rough signs of the right hand laid tothe workmans hammer but at all events in painting it is felt by allmen and justly felt</s>  the freedom of the lines of nature can only berepresented by a similar freedom in the hand that follows them thereare curves in the flow of the hair and in the form of the features andin the muscular outline of the body which can in no wise be caught butby a sympathetic freedom in the stroke of the pencil</s>  i do not care whatexample is taken be it the most subtle and careful work of leonardohimself there will be found a play and power and ease in the outlineswhich no slow effort could ever imitate</s>  and if the preraphaelites donot understand how this kind of power in its highest perfection may beunited with the most severe rendering of all other orders of truth andespecially of those with which they themselves have most sympathy letthem look at the drawings of john lewis</s> 223</s>  these then are the principal lessons which we have to learn fromturner in his second or central period of labor</s>  there is one morehowever to be received and that is a warning for towards the close ofit what with doing small conventional vignettes for publishers makingshowy drawings from sketches taken by other people of places he hadnever seen and touching up the bad engravings from his works submittedto him

them in grace of design and that in a word there is not ashadow of resemblance between the two styles</s>  the preraphaelitesimitate no pictures they paint from nature only</s>  but they have opposedthemselves as a body to that kind of teaching above described whichonly began after raphaels time and they have opposed themselves assternly to the entire feeling of the renaissance schools a feelingcompounded of indolence infidelity sensuality and shallow pride</s> therefore they have called themselves preraphaelite</s>  if they adhere totheir principles and paint nature as it is around

ofthe preraphaelite school as yet</s>  in such courtesy only let themasterless reader permit it me</s> 228</s>  i must endeavor first to give as well as i can by descriptionsome general notion of the subjects and treatment of the three pictures</s> rossettis annunciation differs from every previous conception of thescene known to me in representing the angel as waking the virgin fromsleep to give her his message</s>  the messenger himself also differs fromangels as they are commonly represented in not depending forrecognition of his supernatural character on the insertion of birdswings at his shoulders</s>  if we are to know him for an angel at all itmust be by his face which is that simply of youthful but gravemanhood</s>  he is neither transparent in body luminous in presence

unseen by the virgin</s> she herself is an english not a jewish girl of about sixteen orseventeen of such pale and thoughtful beauty as rossetti could bestimagine for her concerning which effort and its degree of success wewill inquire farther presently</s> she has risen half up not started up in being awakened and is notlooking at the angel but only thinking it seems with eyes cast downas if

spectatorlittle inclined towards the praise of barren uprightnesse andaccustomed on the contrary to expect radiance in archangels and gracein madonnas the first effect of the design must be extremelydispleasing and the first is perhaps with most artamateurs of moderndays likely to be the last</s> 229</s>  the background of the second picture millais blind girl is anopen english common

oldfashioned in the sense of old at suppose bromleyor sevenoaks and with a pretty little church belonging to them itswindow traceries freshly whitewashed by order of the careful warden</s> the common is a fairly spacious bit of ragged pasture with a couple ofdonkeys feeding on it and a cow or two and at the side of the publicroad passing over it the blind girl has sat down to rest awhile</s>  she

carefulreaders of my recent lectures at oxford know that i entirely ignore thedifference of material between oil and water as diluents of color wheni am examining any grave art question nor shall i hereafter throughoutthis paper take notice of it</s>  nor do i think it needful to ask thepardon of any of the three artists for confining the readers attentionat present to comparatively minor and elementary examples of theirworks</s>  if i can succeed in explaining the principles involved in themtheir application by the reader will be easily extended to the enjoymentof better examples</s> this drawing of mr</s>  joness however is far less representative of hisscale of power than either of the two pieces already described whichhave both cost their artists much care and time while this

faces in obscurity and none aredrawn with much care not even the brides but with enough to show thather features are at least as beautiful as those of an ordinary greekgoddess while the depth of the

gems</s>  her bridegroom stoops forward alittle to look at her so that we see his front face and can see alsothat he loves her</s> 231</s>  such being the respective effort and design of the three picturesalthough i put by for the moment any question of their mechanicalskill or manner it must yet i believe be felt by the reader that asworks of young men they contained and even nailed to the academygates a kind of lutheran challenge to the then accepted teachers inall european schools of art perhaps a little too shrill and petulant inthe tone of it but yet curiously resolute and steady in its triplefraternity as of william of burglen with his melchthal and stauffacherin the grutli meadow not wholly to be scorned by even the knightliestpowers of the past</s> we have indeed since these pictures were first exhibited becomeaccustomed to many forms both of pleasing and revolting innovation butconsider in those early times how the pious persons who had alwaysbeen accustomed to see their madonnas dressed in scrupulously folded andexquisitely falling robes of blue with edges embroidered in goldtofind them also sitting under arcades of exquisitest architecture byberniniand reverently to observe them receive the angels messagewith their hands folded on their breasts in the most graceful positionsand the missals they had been previously studying laid open on theirknees see my own

conceive a virgin waking from her sleep on apallet bed in a plain room startled by sudden words and ghostlypresence which she does not comprehend and casting in her mind whatmanner of salutation this should be</s> 232</s>  again consider with respect to the second picture how thelearned possessors of works of established reputation by the ancientmasters classically catalogued as landscapes with figures and whoheld it for eternal artistic law that such pictures should eitherconsist of a rock with a spanish chestnut growing out of the side ofit and three banditti in helmets and big feathers on the top or elseof a corinthian temple built beside an arm of the sea with the queenof sheba beneath preparing for embarkation to visit solomonthe wholeproperly toned down with amber varnishimagine the firstconsternation and final wrath of these cognoscenti at being askedto contemplate deliberately and to the last rent of her ragged gownand for principal object in a finished picture a vagrant who ought atonce to have been sent to the workhouse and some really green grass andblue flowers as they actually may any day be seen on an englishcommonside</s> and finally let us imagine if imagination fail us not the far morewide and weighty indignation of the public accustomed always to see itspaintings of marriages elaborated in christian propriety and splendorwith a bishop officiating assisted by a dean and an archdeacon themodesty of the bride expressed by a veil of the most expensivevalenciennes and the robes of the bridesmaids designed by theperfectest of parisian artists and looped up

with flowersatwhich the bridesmaids danced barefootand in which nothing was knownor even conjecturable respecting the bridegroom but his love</s> 233</s>  such being the manifestly opponent and agonistic temper of thesethree pictures and admitting which i will crave the reader to do forthe nonce their real worth and power to be considerable it surelybecomes a matter of no little interest to see what spirit it is thatthey have in common which recognized as revolutionary in the minds ofthe young artists themselves caused them with more or less offirmness to constitute themselves into a

discover on reflection that there isreally only one quite common and sympathetic impulse shown in thesethree works otherwise so distinct in aim and execution</s>  and thisfraternal link he will if careful in reflection discover to be aneffort to represent so far as in these youths lay either the choice orthe power things as they are or were or may be instead of accordingto the practice of their

human minds to contemplate things as theyare than as they are not</s> thus mr</s>  rossetti in this and subsequent works of the kind thought itbetter for himself and his public to make some effort

itdesirable rather to paint such grass and foliage as he saw in kentsurrey and other solidly accessible english counties than to imitateeven the most elysian fields enameled by claude or the

full expression of what iknew best namely that all things many or few which we ought topaint must be first distinguished boldly from the nothings which weought not and that a faithful realist before

but the general reader may be atleast assured that it is not at all possible for the student to enterinto useful discussion concerning the qualities of art which takes onitself to represent things as they are unless he include in itssubjects the spectral no less than the substantial reality andunderstand what difference must be between the powers of veritablerepresentation for the men whose models

luxurythe carved bedsteadsof vienna and glued toys of switzerland and gay jewelry of franceinthat very year i say the greatest pictures of the venetian masterswere rotting at venice in the rain for want of roof to cover them withholes made by cannon shot through their canvas</s> there is another fact however more curious than either of these whichwill hereafter be connected with the history of the palace now inbuilding namely that at the very period when europe is congratulatedon the invention of a new style of architecture because fourteen acresof ground have been covered with glass the

monuments they areintended to preserve than fire war or revolution</s>  for they areundertaken in the plurality of instances under an impression whichthe efforts of all true antiquaries have as yet

the worst state of the sculptureswhose restoration is demanded may be fairly represented by that of thecelebrated group of the fates among the elgin marbles in the britishmuseum</s>  with what favor

necessary operations consist in substitutingnew stones for decayed ones where they are absolutely essential to thestability of the fabric in propping with wood or metal the portionslikely to give way

alwaysunsightly and meet with little approbation from the general public sothat a strong temptation is necessarily felt by the superintendents ofpublic works to execute the required repairs in a

the form of a new church to beerected in some other part of their city models of such portions oftheir cathedral as were falling into decay would be looked upon asmerely asking for employment and his

respect for human nature</s>  but i would rather leave itto others than myself to pronounce how far such a temptation is alwayslikely to be resisted and how far when repairs are once permitted tobe undertaken a fabric is likely to be spared from mere interest in itsbeauty when its destruction under the name of restoration has becomepermanently remunerative to a large body of workmen</s> let us assume however that the architect is alwaysconscientiousalways willing the moment he has done what is strictlynecessary for the safety and decorous aspect of the building to abandonhis income and declare his farther services unnecessary</s>  let uspresume also that every one of the two or three hundred workmen whomust be employed under him is equally conscientious and during thecourse of years

whose littlegarden is sheltered by the mighty buttresses from the north wind whoknows the worth of the cathedral</s>  it is the bustling mayor and theprosperous architect who determine its fate</s> i

the applications and chasten the extravagance of my writingslet me also say of them that they were the expression of a delight inthe art of architecture which was too intense to be vitally deceivedand of an inquiry too honest and eager to be without some useful resultand i only wish i had now time and strength and power of mind to carryon more worthily the main endeavor of my early work</s>  that mainendeavor has been throughout to set forth the life of the individualhuman spirit as modifying the application of the formal laws ofarchitecture no less than of all other arts and to show that the powerand advance of this art even in conditions of formal nobleness weredependent on its just association with sculpture as a means ofexpressing the beauty of natural forms and i the more boldly ask yourpermission to insist somewhat on this main meaning of my past workbecause there are many buildings now rising in the streets of london asin other cities of england which appear to be designed in accordancewith this principle and which are i believe more offensive to all whothoughtfully concur with me in accepting the principle of naturalismthan they are to the classical architect to whose modes of design theyare visibly antagonistic</s>  these buildings in which the mere cast of aflower or the realization of a vulgar face carved without pleasure bya workman who is only endeavoring to attract attention by novelty andthen fastened on or appearing to be fastened as chance may dictate toan arch or a pillar or a wall hold such relation to noblynaturalistic architecture as common signpainters furniture landscapesdo to painting or commonest waxwork to greek sculpture and thefeelings with which true naturalists regard such buildings of this classare as nearly as might be what a painter would experience if havingcontended earnestly against conventional schools and having assertedthat greek vasepainting and egyptian wallpainting and medivalglasspainting though beautiful all in their place and way were yetsubordinate arts and culminated only in perfectly naturalistic worksuch as raphaels in fresco and titians on canvasif i say apainter fixed in such faith in an entire

if carried out would finally lead</s> 276</s>  and because this question lies at the very root of the organizationof the system of instruction for our youth i venture boldly to expressthe surprise and regret with which i see our schools still agitated byassertions of the opposition of naturalism to invention and to thehigher conditions of art</s>  even in this very room i believe there haslately been question whether a sculptor should look at a real livingcreature of which he had to carve the image</s>  i would answer in onesenseno that is to say he ought to carve no living creature whilehe still needs to look at it</s>  if we do not know what a human body islike we certainly had better look and look often at it before wecarve it but if we already know the human likeness so well that we cancarve it by light of memory we shall not need to ask whether we oughtnow to look at it or not and what is true of man is true of all othercreatures and organismsof bird and beast and leaf</s>  no assertion ismore at variance with the laws of classical as well as of subsequent artthan the common one that species should not be distinguished in greatdesign</s>  we might as well say that we ought to carve a man so as not toknow him from an ape as that we should carve a lily so as not to knowit from a thistle</s>  it is difficult for me to conceive how this can beasserted in the presence of any

men themselves happier wiser andbetter and secondly those who desire to enable them to produce betterand more valuable work</s>  these two objects may of course be kept bothin view at the same time nevertheless there is a wide difference inthe spirit with which we shall approach our task according to themotive of these two which weighs most with usa difference great enoughto divide as i have said the promoters of any such scheme into twodistinct classes one philanthropic in the gist of its aim and theother commercial in the gist of its aim one desiring the workman to bebetter informed chiefly for his own sake and the other chiefly that hemay be enabled to produce for us commodities precious in themselvesand which shall successfully compete with those of other countries</s> 2</s>  and this separation in motives must lead also to a distinction in themachinery of the work</s>  the philanthropists address themselves not tothe artisan merely but to the laborer in general desiring in anypossible way to refine the habits or increase the happiness of our wholeworking population by giving them new recreations or new thoughts andthe principles of arteducation adopted in a school which has this widebut somewhat indeterminate aim are or should be very different fromthose adopted in a school meant for the special instruction of theartisan in his own business</s>  i do not think this distinction is yetfirmly enough fixed in our minds or calculated upon in our plans ofoperation</s>  we have hitherto acted it seems to me under a vagueimpression that the arts of drawing and painting might be up to acertain point taught in a general way to everyone and would doeveryone equal good and that each class of operatives might afterwardsbring this general knowledge into use in their own trade according toits requirements</s>  now that is not so</s>  a woodcarver needs for hisbusiness to learn drawing in quite a different way from a chinapainterand a jeweler from a worker in iron</s>  they must be led to study quitedifferent characters in the natural forms they introduce in theirvarious manufacture</s>  it is no use to teach an ironworker to observe thedown on a peach and of none to teach laws of atmospheric effect to acarver in wood</s>  so far as their business is concerned their brainswould be vainly occupied by such things and they would be preventedfrom pursuing with enough distinctness or intensity the qualities ofart which can alone be expressed in the materials with which they eachhave to do</s> 3</s>  now i believe it to be wholly impossible to teach specialapplication of art principles to various trades in a single school</s>  thatspecial application can be only learned rightly by the experience ofyears in the particular work required</s>  the power of each material andthe difficulties connected with its treatment are not so much to betaught as to be felt it is only by repeated touch and continued trialbeside the forge or the furnace that the goldsmith can find out how togovern his gold or the glassworker his crystal and it is only bywatching and assisting the actual practice of a master in the businessthat the apprentice can learn the efficient secrets of manipulation orperceive the true limits of the involved conditions of design</s>  it seemsto me therefore that all idea of reference to definite businessesshould be abandoned in such schools as that just established we canhave neither the materials the conveniences nor the empirical skill inthe master necessary to make such teaching useful</s>  all specificartteaching must be given in schools established by each trade foritself and when our operatives are a little more enlightened on thesematters there will be found as i have already stated in my lectures onthe political economy of art59 absolute necessity for theestablishment of guilds of trades in an active and practical form forthe purposes of ascertaining the principles of art proper to theirbusiness and instructing their apprentices in them as well as makingexperiments on materials and on newlyinvented methods of procedurebesides many other functions which i cannot now enter into account of</s> all this for the present and in a school such as this i repeat wecannot hope for we shall obtain no satisfactory result unless we giveup such hope and set ourselves to teaching the operative

think of</s>  but to be taught to see is to gain word and thought atonce and both true</s>  there is a vague acknowledgment of this in the waypeople are continually expressing their longing for light until all thecommon language of our prayers and hymns has sunk into little more thanone monotonous metaphor dimly twisted into alternate languagesaskingfirst in latin to be illuminated and then in english to be enlightenedand then in latin again to be delivered out of obscurity and then inenglish to be delivered out of darkness and then for beams and raysand suns and stars and lamps until sometimes one wishes that atleast for religious purposes there were no such words as light ordarkness in existence</s>  still the main instinct which makes peopleendure this perpetuity of repetition

attending to eyes than to hands we shall always domost good by simply endeavoring to enable the student to see naturalobjects clearly and truly</s>  we ought not even to try too strenuously togive him the power of representing them</s>  that power may be acquiredmore or less by exercises which are no wise conducive to accuracy ofsight and vice vers accuracy of sight may be gained by exerciseswhich in no wise conduce to ease of representation</s>  for instance itvery much assists the power of drawing to spend many hours in thepractice of washing in flat tints but all this manual practice does notin the least increase the students power of determining what the tintof a given object actually is</s>  he would be more advanced in theknowledge of the facts by a single hour of welldirected andwellcorrected effort rubbing out and putting in again lighteningand darkening and scratching and blotching in patient endeavors toobtain concordance with fact issuing perhaps after all in totaldestruction or unpresentability of the drawing but also in acuteperception of the things he has been attempting to copy in it</s>  ofcourse there is always a vast temptation felt both by the master andstudent to struggle towards visible results and obtain somethingbeautiful creditable or salable in way of actual drawing but themore i see of schools the more reason i see to look with doubt uponthose which produce too many showy and complete works by pupils</s>  a showywork will always be found on stern examination of it to have been doneby some conventional rulesome servile compliance with directionswhich the student does not see the reason for and representation oftruths which he has not himself perceived the execution of suchdrawings will be found monotonous and lifeless their light and shadespecious and formal but false</s>  a drawing which the pupil has learnedmuch in doing is nearly always full of blunders and mishaps and it ishighly necessary for the formation of a truly public or universal schoolof art that the masters should not try to conceal or anticipate suchblunders but only seek to employ the pupils time so as to get the mostprecious results for his understanding and his heart not for his hand</s> 6</s>  for observe the best that you can do in the production of drawingor of draughtsmanship must always be nothing in itself unless thewhole life be

belonging to the higherranks of life our main duty will be to make them good judges of artrather than artists for though i had a month to speak to you insteadof an hour time would fail me if i tried to trace the various ways inwhich we suffer nationally for want of powers of enlightened judgmentof art in our upper and middle classes</s>  not that this judgment can everbe obtained without discipline of the hand no man ever was a thoroughjudge of painting who could not draw but the drawing should only bethought of as a means of fixing his attention upon the subtleties of theart put before him or of enabling him to record such natural facts asare necessary for comparison with it</s>  i should also attach the greatestimportance to severe limitation of choice in the examples submitted tohim</s>  to study one good master till you understand him will teach youmore than a superficial acquaintance with a thousand power of criticismdoes not consist in knowing the names or the

to the second or commercial question namely howto get from the workman after we have trained him the best and mostprecious work so as to enable ourselves to compete with foreigncountries or develop new branches of commerce in our own</s> many of us perhaps are under the impression that plenty of schoolingwill do this that plenty of lecturing will do it that sending abroadfor patterns will do it

deficient and notonly had remained from its earliest ages till now without poetrywithout art and without music except a mere modulated cry but as faras i could judge from the rude efforts of their

thing for me to find</s>  and then to mend thematter i went straight over into italy and came at once upon acurious instance of the patronage of art of the character that usuallyinclines most to such patronage and of the consequences thereof</s> from morgarten and grutli i intended to have crossed to the vaudoisvalleys to examine the shepherd character there but on the way i hadto pass through turin where unexpectedly i found the paul veronesesone of which as i told you just now stayed me at once for six weeks</s> naturally enough one asked how these beautiful veroneses came thereand found they had been commissioned by cardinal maurice of savoy</s> worthy cardinal i thought thats what cardinals were made for</s> however going a little farther in the gallery one comes upon four

decorating a room or ofchoosing a subject for a picture than by some renewed reference to fireand water or summer and winter nor were ever tired of hearing thatsummer came after spring and that air was not earth until theseinteresting pieces of information got finally and poetically expressedin that wellknown piece of elegant english conversation about theweather thomsons seasons</s>  so the cardinal not appearing to have anybetter idea than the popular one orders the four elements but thinkingthat the elements pure would be slightly dull he orders them in oneway or another to be mixed up with cupids to have in his own wordsuna copiosa quantita di amorini</s>  albani supplied the cardinalaccordingly with cupids in clusters they hang in the sky like bunchesof cherries and leap out of

objects of interest to the traveler asan example of italian domestic architecture to me during my stay inthe city it was much more than an object of interest for its desertedgardens were by much the

they are pursued or possessed in theservice of pleasure only</s> 21</s>  this then is the great enigma of art historyyou must not followart without pleasure nor must you follow it for the sake of pleasure</s> and the solution of that enigma is simply this fact that wherever arthas been followed only for the sake of luxury or delight it hascontributed and largely contributed to bring about the destruction ofthe nation practicing it but wherever art has been used also to teachany truth or supposed truthreligious moral or naturalthere it haselevated the nation practicing it and itself with the nation</s> 22</s>  thus the art of greece rose and did service to the people so longas it was to them the earnest interpreter of a religion they believedin the arts of northern sculpture and architecture rose asinterpreters of christian legend and doctrine the art of painting initaly not only as religious but also mainly as expressive of truths ofmoral philosophy and powerful in pure human portraiture</s>  the only greatpainters in our schools of painting in england have either been ofportraitreynolds and gainsborough of the philosophy of sociallifehogarth or of the facts of nature in landscapewilson andturner</s>  in all these cases if i had time i could show you that thesuccess of the painter depended on his desire to convey a truth ratherthan to produce a merely beautiful picture that is to say to get alikeness of a man or of a place to get some moral principle rightlystated or some historical character rightly described rather thanmerely to give pleasure to the eyes</s>  compare the feeling with which amoorish architect decorated an arch of the alhambra with that ofhogarth painting the marriage  la mode or of wilkie painting thechelsea pensioners and you will at once feel the difference betweenart pursued for pleasure only and for the sake of some useful principleor impression</s> 23</s>  but what you might not so easily discern is that even when paintingdoes appear to have been pursued for pleasure only if ever you find itrise to any noble level you will also find that a stern search aftertruth has been at the root of its nobleness</s>  you may fancy perhapsthat titian veronese and tintoret were painters for the sake ofpleasure only but in reality they were the only painters who eversought entirely to master and who did entirely master the truths oflight and shade as associated with color in the noblest of all physicalcreated things the human form</s>  they were the only men who ever paintedthe human body all other painters of the great schools are mereanatomical draughtsmen compared to them rather makers of maps of thebody than painters of it</s>  the venetians alone by a toil almostsuperhuman succeeded at last in obtaining a power almost superhumanand were able finally to paint the highest visible work of god withunexaggerated structure undegraded color and unaffected gesture</s>  itseems little to say this but i assure you it is much to have donethisso much that no other men but the venetians ever did it none ofthem ever painted the human body without in some degree caricaturing theanatomy forcing the action or degrading the hue</s> 24</s>  now therefore the sum of all is that you who wish to encourageart in england have to do two things with it you must delight in it inthe first place and you must get it to serve some serious work in thesecond place</s>  i dont mean by serious necessarily moral all that imean by serious is in some way or other useful not merely selfishcareless or indolent</s>  i had indeed intended before closing myaddress to have traced out a few of the directions in which as itseems to me art may be seriously and practically serviceable to us inthe career of civilization</s>  i had hoped to show you how many of thegreat phenomena of nature still remained unrecorded by it for us torecord how many of the historical monuments of europe were perishingwithout memorial for the want of but a little honest simplelaborious loving draughtsmanship how many of the most impressivehistorical events of the day failed of teaching us half of what theywere meant to teach for want of painters to represent them faithfullyinstead of fancifully and with historical truth for their aim insteadof national selfglorification</s>  i had hoped to show you how many of thebest impulses of the heart were lost in frivolity or sensuality forwant of purer beauty to contemplate and of noble thoughts to associatewith the fervor of hallowed human passion how finally a great part ofthe vital power of our religious faith was lost in us for want of suchart as would realize in some rational probable believable way thoseevents of sacred history which as they visibly and intelligiblyoccurred may also be visibly and intelligibly represented</s>  but all thisi dare not do yet</s>  i felt as i thought over these things that the timewas not yet come for their declaration the time will come for it

blessingswhich the arts may have yet in store for mankind</s>  as yet there is noneed to do so all that we have to plead for is an earnest andstraightforward exertion in those courses of study which are opened tous day by day believing only that they are to be followed gravely andfor grave purposes as by men and not by children</s>  i appeal finallyto all those who are to become the pupils of these schools to keepclear of the notion of following art as dilettantism it ought todelight you as your reading delights youbut you never think of yourreading as dilettantism</s>  it ought to delight you as your studies ofphysical science delight youbut you dont call physical sciencedilettantism</s>  if you are determined only to think of art as a play or apleasure give it up at once you will do

smile better infinitely betterthat you should never handle a pencil at all than handle it only forthe sake of complacency in your small dexterity better infinitelybetter that you should be wholly

manual labor by which they must live are not likely totake up the notion that they can learn any other art for amusement onlybut amateurs are and it is of the highest importance nay it is justthe one

any other simple objectinvolving varied contour should be outlined in ink</s> how thick thelines should be and how varied</s>  my own idea of an elementary outline isthat it should be unvaried distinctly visible not thickened towardsthe shaded sides of the object not express any exaggerations of arialperspective nor fade at the further side of a cup as if it were thefurther side of a crater of a volcano and therefore in objects ofordinary size show no gradation at all unless where the real outlinedisappears as in soft contours and folds</s>  nay i think it may even be aquestion whether we ought not to resolve that the line should nevergradate itself at all but terminate quite bluntly</s>  albert drerscannon furnishes a very peculiar and curious example of this entirelyequal line even to the extreme distance being in that respect opposedto nearly all his other work which is wrought mostly by tapering linesand his work in general and holbeins which appear to me entirelytypical

pass into some suggestion ofshade in the inner masses</s>  for there are no examples whatever of pureoutlines by the great masters</s>  they are always touched or modified byinner lines more or less suggestive of solid form and they are lost oraccentuated in certain places not so much in conformity with anyexplicable law as in expression of the masters future purpose or ofwhat he wishes

indeterminablethough exquisitely successful</s>  his stupendous drawings in the britishmuseum i can justly use no other term than stupendous of theirconsummately decisive power furnish finer instances of this treatmentthan any at basle but it would be very difficult to reduce them to adefinable law</s>  venetian outlines are rare except preparations oncanvas often shaded before coloringwhile raphaels if not shadedare quite loose and useless as examples to a beginner so that we areleft wholly without guide as to the preparatory steps on which we shoulddecisively insist and i am myself

the original</s> </s> chapter vii</s> 7785</s>  in recommencing this series of papers i may perhaps take permissionbriefly to remind the reader of the special purpose which my desultoryway of writing of so vast a subject i find it impossible to writeotherwise than desultorily may cause him sometimes to lose sight ofthe ascertainment namely of some laws for present practice of art inour schools which may be admitted if not with absolute at least witha sufficient consent by leading artists</s> there are indeed many principles on which different men must ever be atvariance others respecting which it may be impossible to obtain anypractical consent in certain phases of particular schools</s>  but there area few which i think in all times of meritorious art the leadingpainters would admit and others which by discussion might be arrivedat as at all events the best discoverable for the time</s> 86</s>  one of those which i suppose great workmen would always admit isthat whatever material we use the virtues of that material are to beexhibited and its defects frankly admitted no effort being made toconquer those defects by such skill as may make the material resembleanother</s>  for instance in the dispute so frequently revived by thepublic touching the relative merits of oil color and water color i donot think a great painter would ever consider it a merit in a watercolor to have the force of oil</s>  he would like it to have the peculiardelicacy paleness and transparency belonging specially to its ownmaterial</s>  on the other hand i think he would not like an oil paintingto have the deadness or paleness of a water color</s>  he would like it tohave the deep shadows and the rich glow and crumbling and bossytouches which are alone attainable in oil color</s>  and if he painted infresco he would neither aim at the transparency of water color nor therichness of oil but at luminous bloom of surface and dignity ofclearly visible form</s>  i do not think that this principle would bedisputed by artists of great power at any time or in any countrythough if by mischance they had been compelled to work in one materialwhile desiring the qualities only attainable in another they mightstrive and meritoriously strive for those better results with whatthey had under their hand</s>  the change of manner in william hunts workin the later part of his life was an example of this</s>  as his art becamemore developed he perceived in his subjects qualities which it wasimpossible to express in a transparent medium and employed opaque whiteto draw with when the finer forms of relieved light could not beotherwise followed</s>  it was out of his power to do more than this sincein later life any attempt to learn the manipulation of oil color wouldhave been unadvisable and he obtained results of singular beautythough their preciousness and completion would never in a wellfoundedschool of art have been trusted to the frail substance of water color</s> 87</s>  but although i do not suppose that the abstract principle of doingwith each material what it is best fitted to do would be in termsanywhere denied the practical question is always not what should bedone with this or that if everything were in our power but what canbe or ought to be accomplished with the means at our disposal and inthe circumstances under which we must necessarily work</s>  thus in thequestion immediately before us of the proper use of the black lineitis easy to establish the proper virtue of line work as essentiallydelineation the expressing by outline the true limits of formswhich distinguish and part them from other forms just as the virtue ofbrush work is essentially breadth softness and blending of forms</s>  andin the abstract the point ought not to be used where the aim is notthat of definition nor the brush to be used where the aim is not thatof breadth</s>  every painting in which the aim is primarily that ofdrawing and every drawing in which the aim is primarily that ofpainting must alike be in a measure erroneous</s>  but it is one thing todetermine what should be done with the black line in a period of highlydisciplined and widely practiced art and quite another thing to saywhat should be done with it at this present time in england</s> especially the increasing interest and usefulness of our illustratedbooks render this an inquiry of very great social and educationalimportance</s>  on the one side the skill and felicity of the work spentupon them and the advantage which young readers if not those of allages might derive from having examples of good drawing put familiarlybefore their eyes cannot be overrated yet on the other side neitherthe admirable skill nor free felicity of the work can ultimately be helda counterpoise for the wantif there be a wantof sterling excellencewhile farther this increased power of obtaining examples of art forprivate possession at an almost nominal price has two accompanyingevils it prevents the proper use of what we have by dividing theattention and continually leading us restlessly to demand new subjectsof interest while the old are as yet not half exhausted and itprevents ussatisfied with the multiplication of minor art in our ownpossessionfrom looking for a better satisfaction in great publicworks</s> 88</s>  observe first it prevents the proper use of what we have</s>  i oftenendeavor though with little success to conceive what would have beenthe effect on my mind when i was a boy of having such a book given meas watsons illustrated robinson crusoe</s> 78 the edition i had was asmall octavo one in two volumes printed at the chiswick press in1812</s>  it has in each volume eight or ten very rude vignettes about acouple of inches wide cut in the simple but legitimate manner ofbewick and though wholly commonplace and devoid of beauty yet as faras they go rightly done and here and there sufficiently suggestive ofplain facts</s>  i am quite unable to say how far i wastedhow far i spentto advantagethe unaccountable hours during which i pored over thesewoodcuts receiving more real sensation of sympathetic terror from thedrifting hair and fearstricken face of crusoe dashed against the rockin the rude attempt at the representation of his escape from the wreckthan i can now from the highest art though the rocks and water arealike cut only with a few twisted or curved lines and there is not theslightest attempt at light and shade or imitative resemblance</s>  for onething i am quite sure that being forced to make all i could out of verylittle things and to remain long contented with them not only in greatpart formed the power of close analysis in my mind and the habit ofsteady contemplation but rendered the power of greater art over mewhen i first saw it as intense as that of magic so that it appealed tome like a vision out of another world</s> 89</s>  on the other hand this long contentment with inferior work and theconsequent acute enjoyment of whatever was the least suggestive of truthin a higher degree rendered me long careless of the highest virtues ofexecution and retarded by many years the maturing and balancing of thegeneral power of judgment</s>  and i am now as i said quite unable toimagine what would have been the result upon me of being enabled tostudy instead of these coarse vignettes such lovely and expressivework as that of watson suppose for instance the vignette at p</s>  87which would have been sure to have caught my fancy because of the dogwith its head on crusoes knee looking up and trying to understand whatis the matter with his master</s>  it remains to be seen and can only beknown by experience what will actually be the effect of these treasureson the minds of children that possess them</s>  the result must be in somesort different from anything yet known no such art was ever yetattainable by the youth of any nation</s>  yet of this there can as i havejust said be no reasonable doubtthat it is not well to make theimagination indolent or take its work out of its hands by supplyingcontinual pictures of what might be sufficiently conceived withoutpictures</s> 90</s>  take for instance the preceding vignette in the same bookcrusoe looking at the first shoots of barley</s>  nothing can be morenatural or successful as a representation but after all whatever theimportance of the moment in crusoes history the picture can show usnothing more than a man in a white shirt and dark pantaloons in anattitude of surprise and the imagination ought to be able to compass somuch as this without help</s>  and if so laborious aid be given much moreought to be given</s>  the virtue of art as of life is that no line shallbe in vain</s>  now the number of lines in this vignette applied with fullintention of thought in every touch as they would have been by holbeinor drer are quite enough to have producednot a merely deceptivedash of local color with evanescent backgroundbut an entirelyperfect piece of chiaroscuro with its lights all truly limited andgradated and with every form of leaf and rock in the backgroundentirely right completeand full not of mere suggestion but ofaccurate information exactly such as the fancy by itself cannotfurnish</s>  a work so treated by any man of power and sentiment such as thedesigner of this vignette possesses would be an eternal thing ten inthe volume for real enduring and educational power were worth twohundred in imperfect development and would have been a perpetualpossession to the reader whereas one certain result of themultiplication of these lovely but imperfect drawings is to increasethe feverish thirst for excitement and to weaken the power of attentionby endless diversion and division</s>  this volume beautiful as it is willbe forgotten the strength in it is in final outcome spent for naughtand others and still others following it will come like shadows sodepart</s> 91</s>  there is however a quite different disadvantage but no lessgrave to be apprehended from this rich multiplication of privatepossession</s>  the more we have of books and cabinet pictures and cabinetornaments and other such domestic objects of art the less capable weshall become of understanding or enjoying the lofty character of worknoble in scale and intended for public service</s>  the most practical andimmediate distinction between the orders of mean and high art isthat the first is privatethe second public the first for theindividual the second for all</s>  it may be that domestic art is the onlykind which is likely to flourish in a country of cold climate and inthe hands of a nation tempered as the english are but it is necessarythat we should at least understand the disadvantage under which we thuslabor and the duty of not allowing the untowardness of ourcircumstances or the selfishness of our dispositions to haveunresisted and unchecked influence over the adopted style of our art</s> but this part of the subject requires to be examined at length and imust therefore reserve it for the following paper</s> footnotes77 art journal vol</s>  v</s>  pp</s>  9 10</s>  january 1866</s> ed</s>

viii</s> 7992</s>  in pursuing the question put at the close of the last paper it mustbe observed that there are essentially two conditions under which wehave to examine the difference between the effects of public and privateart on national prosperity</s>  the first in immediate influence is theireconomical function the second their ethical</s>  we have first to considerwhat class of persons they in each case support and secondly whatclasses they teach or please</s> looking over the list of the giftbooks of this year perhaps the firstcircumstance which would naturally strike us would be the number ofpersons living by this industry and in any consideration of theprobable effects of a transference of the public attention to otherkinds of work we ought first to contemplate the result on the interestsof the workman</s>  the guinea spent on one of our ordinary illustratedgiftbooks is divided among 1</s>  a number of secondrate or thirdrate artists producing designs as fast as they can

mechanical imitation of this second or thirdrate work of these engravers the inferior classes are usually much overworked</s>  3</s>  printers papermakers ornamental binders and other craftsmen</s>  4</s>  publishers and booksellers</s> 93</s>  let us suppose the book can be remuneratively produced if there isa sale of five thousand copies</s>  then 5000 contributed for it by thepublic are divided among the different workers it does not matter whatactual rate of division we assume for the mere object of comparisonwith other modes of employing the money but let us say these 5000 aredivided among five hundred persons giving on an average 10 to each</s> and let us suppose these 10 to be a fortnights maintenance to each</s> then to maintain them through the year twentyfive such books must bepublished or to keep certainly within the mark of the probable cost ofour autumnal giftbooks suppose 100000 are spent by the public withresultant supply of 100000 households with one illustrated book ofsecond or thirdrate quality each there being twenty different booksthus supplied and resultant maintenance of five hundred persons forthe year at severe work of a second or thirdrate order mostlymechanical</s> 94</s>  now if the mind of the nation instead of private be set on publicwork there is of course no expense incurred for multiplication ormechanical copying of any kind or for retail dealing</s>  the 5000instead of being given for five thousand copies of the work anddivided among five hundred persons are given for one original work andgiven to one person</s>  this one person will of course employ assistantsbut these will be chosen by himself and will form a superior class ofmen out of whom the future leading artists of the time will rise insuccession</s>  the broad difference will therefore be that in the onecase 5000 are divided among five hundred persons of different classesdoing secondrate or wholly mechanical work and in the other case thesame sum is divided among a few chosen persons of the best material ofmind producible by the state at the given epoch</s>  it may seem an unfairassumption that work for the public will be more honestly and earnestlydone than that for private possession</s>  but every motive that can toucheither conscience or ambition is brought to bear upon the artist who isemployed on a public service and only a few such motives in other modesof occupation</s>  the greater permanence scale dignity of office andfuller display of art in a national building combine to call forth theenergies of the artist and if a man will not do his best under suchcircumstances there is no best in him</s> 95</s>  it might also at first seem an unwarrantable assumption that fewerpersons would be employed in the private than in the national worksince at least in architecture quite as many subordinate craftsmen areemployed as in the production of a book</s>  it is however necessary forthe purpose of clearly seeing the effect of the two forms of occupationthat we should oppose them where their contrast is most complete andthat we should compare not merely bookbinding with bricklaying but thepresentation of art in books necessarily involving much subordinateemployment with its presentation in statues or wallpictures involvingonly the labor of the artist and of his immediate assistants</s>  in the onecase then i repeat the sum set aside by the public for artpurposesis divided among many persons very indiscriminately chosen in theother among few carefully chosen</s>  but it does not for that reasonsupport fewer persons</s>  the few artists live on their larger incomes80by expenditure among various tradesmen who in no wise produce art butthe means of pleasant life so that the real economical question is nothow many men shall we maintain but at what work shall they bekept</s> shall they every one be set to produce art for us in which casethey must all live poorly and produce bad art or out of the

the other excited by the peril andpromise of a changeful time shall be a little abated will be found tobe in brief terms the one social question of the day</s> without attempting an answer which would lead us far from the businessin hand i pass to the ethical part of the inquiry to examine namelythe effect of this cheaply diffused art on the public mind</s> 97</s>  the first great principle we have to hold by in dealing with thematter is that the end of art is not to amuse and that all art whichproposes amusement as its end or which is sought for that end must beof an inferior and is probably of a harmful class</s> the end of art is as serious as that of all other beautiful thingsofthe blue sky and the green grass and the clouds and the dew</s>  they areeither useless or they are of much deeper function than givingamusement</s>  whatever delight we take in them be it less or more is notthe delight we take in play or receive from momentary surprise</s>  itmight be a matter of some metaphysical difficulty to define the twokinds of pleasure but it is perfectly easy for any of us to feel thatthere is generic difference between the delight we have in seeing acomedy and in watching a sunrise</s>  not but that there is a kind of divinacommediaa dramatic change and powerin all beautiful things thejoy of surprise and incident mingles in music painting architectureand natural beauty itself in an ennobled and enduring manner with theperfectness of eternal hue and form</s>  but whenever the desire of changebecomes principal whenever we care only for new tunes and newpictures and new scenes all power of enjoying nature or art is so farperished from us and a childs love of toys has taken its place</s>  thecontinual advertisement of new music as if novelty were its virtuesignifies in the inner fact of it that no one now cares for music</s>  thecontinual desire for new exhibitions means that we do not care forpictures the continual demand for new books means that nobody cares toread</s> 98</s>  not that it would necessarily and at all times mean this for in aliving school of art there will always be an exceeding thirst for andeager watching of freshlydeveloped

the carrying of this annual exhibition into the recesses ofhome which is especially to be dreaded in the multiplication of inferiorart for private possession</s>  public amusement or excitement may often bequite wholesomely sought in gay spectacles or enthusiastic festivalsbut we must be careful to the uttermost how we allow the desire for anykind of excitement to mingle among the peaceful continuities of homehappiness</s>  the one stern condition of that happiness is that ourpossessions should be no more than we can thoroughly use and that tothis use they should be practically and

on works from which nothing can be learned</s>  for the only realpleasure and the richest of all amusements to be derived from eitherreading or looking are in the steady progress of the mind and heartwhich day by day are more deeply satisfied and yet more divinelyathirst</s> 100</s>  as far as i know the homes of england of the present day they showa grievous tendency to fall in these important respects into the twogreat classes of overfurnished and unfurnishedof those in which thegreek marble in its niche and the precious shelfloads of the luxuriouslibrary leave the inmates nevertheless dependent for all their truepastime on horse gun and croquetgroundand those in which arthonored only by the presence of a couple of engravings from landseerand literature represented by a few magazines and annuals arranged in astar on the drawingroom table are felt to be entirely foreign to thedaily business of life and entirely unnecessary to its domesticpleasures</s> 101</s>  the introduction of furniture of art into households of this latterclass is now taking place rapidly and of course by the usual systemof the ingenious english practical mind will take place under thegeneral law of supply and demand that is to say that whatever a classof consumers entirely unacquainted with the different qualities of thearticle they are buying choose to ask for will be duly supplied tothem by the trade</s>  i observe that this beautiful system is graduallyextending lower and lower in education and that children like grownuppersons are more and more able to obtain their toys without anyreference to what is useful or useless or right or wrong but on thegreat horseleechs law of demand and supply</s>  and indeed i writethese papers knowing well how effectless all speculations on abstractproprieties or possibilities must be in the present ravening state ofnational desire for excitement but the tracing of moral or ofmathematical law brings its own quiet reward though it may be for thetime impossible to apply either to use</s> the power of the new influences which have been brought to bear on themiddleclass mind with respect to art may be sufficiently seen in thegreat rise in the price of pictures which has taken place principallyduring the last twenty years owing to the interest occasioned bynational exhibitions coupled with facilities of carriage stimulatingthe activity of dealers and the collateral discovery by mercantile menthat pictures are not a bad investment</s> 102</s>  the following copy of a document in my own possession will give usa

main classes fine line engravings always grave inpurpose typically represented by goodalls illustrations to rogersspoemsfine woodcuts or etchings grave in purpose such as those bydalziel from thomson

of pure line engraving</s> this is the only means by which entire refinement of intellectualrepresentation can be given to the public</s>  photographs have aninimitable mechanical refinement and their legal evidence is of greatuse if you know how to crossexamine them</s>  they are popularly supposedto be true and at the worst they are so in the sense in which anecho is true to a conversation of which it omits the most importantsyllables and reduplicates the rest</s>  but this truth of mere transcripthas nothing to do with art properly so called and will never supersedeit</s>  delicate art of design or of selected truth can only be presentedto the general public by true line engraving</s>  it will be enough for mypurpose to instance three books in which its power has been sincerelyused</s>  i am more in fields than libraries and have never cared to lookmuch into book illustrations there are therefore of course numbersof wellillustrated works of which i know nothing but the three ishould myself name as typical of good use of the method are i</s>  rogersspoems ii</s>  the leipsic edition of heynes virgil 1800 and iii</s>  thegreat description de legypte</s> 104</s>  the vignettes in the first named volumes considering the italyand poems as one book i believe to be as skillful and tender as anyhand work of the kind ever done they are also wholly free fromaffectation of overwrought fineness on the one side and from hasty orcheap expediencies on the other and they were produced under thedirection and influence of a gentleman and a scholar</s>  multitudes ofworks imitative of these and far more attractive have been producedsince but none of any sterling quality the good books were i wastold a loss to their publisher and the money spent since in the samemanner has been wholly thrown away</s>  yet these volumes are enough to showwhat lovely service line engraving might be put upon if the generaltaste were advanced enough to desire it</s>  their vignettes from stothardhowever conventional show in the grace and tenderness of their livingsubjects how types of innocent beauty as pure as angelicos and farlovelier might indeed be given from modern english life to exalt theconception of youthful dignity and sweetness in every household</s>  i knownothing among the phenomena of the present age more sorrowful than thatthe beauty of our youth should remain wholly unrepresented in fine artbecause unfelt by ourselves and that the only vestiges of a likeness toit should be in some of the more subtle passages of caricatures popularand justly popular as much because they were the only attainablereflection of the prettiness as because they were the only sympathizingrecords of the humors of english girls and boys</s>  of our oil portraitsof them in which their beauty is always conceived as consisting in afixed simperfeet not more than two inches long and accessory groundspony and groomour sentence need not be guarda e passa butpassa only</s>  yet one oil picture has been painted and so far as iknow one only representing the deeper loveliness of english youththeportraits of the three children of the dean of christ church by the sonof the great portrait painter who has recorded whatever is tender andbeautiful in the faces of the aged men of england bequeathing as itseems the beauty of their children to the genius of his child</s> 105</s>  the second book which i named heynes virgil shows thoughunequally and insufficiently what might be done by line engraving togive vital image of classical design and symbol of classical thought</s> it is profoundly to be regretted that none of these old andwellillustrated classics can be put frankly into the hands of youthwhile all books lately published for general service pretending toclassical illustration are in point of art absolutely dead andharmful rubbish</s>  i cannot but think that the production ofwellillustrated classics would at least leave free of moneyscathe andin great honor any publisher who undertook it and although schoolboysin general might not care for any such help to one here and there itwould make all the difference between loving his work and hating it</s>  formyself i am quite certain that a single vignette like that of thefountain of arethusa in heyne would have set me on an eager questwhich would have saved me years of sluggish and fruitless labor</s> 106</s>  it is the more strange and the more to be regretted that no suchworthy applications of line engraving are now made because merely togratify a fantastic pride works are often undertaken in which for wantof welleducated draughtsmen the mechanical skill of the engraver hasbeen wholly wasted and nothing produced useful except for commonreference</s>  in the great work published by the dilettanti society forinstance the engravers have been set to imitate at endless cost ofsickly fineness in dotted and hatched execution drawings in which thelight and shade is always forced and vulgar if not utterly false</s> constantly as in the 37th plate of the first volume waving hair castsa straight shadow not only on the forehead but even on the ripples ofother curls emerging beneath it while

assumed its name</s> 107</s>  the third book above named as a typical example of right work inline the description de legypte is one of the greatest monumentsof calm human industry honestly and

plates of natural history in thisbook</s>  of unemotional but devotedly earnest and rigidly faithful labori know no other such example</s>  the lithographs to agassizs poissonsfossiles are good in their kind but it is a far lower and easier kindand the popularly visible result is in larger proportion to the skillwhereas none but workmen can know the magnificent devotion ofunpretending and observant toil involved in even a single figure of aninsect or a starfish on these unapproachable plates</s>  apply such skill tothe simple presentation of the natural history of every english countyand make the books portable in size and i cannot conceive any otherbookgift to our youth so precious</s> 108</s>  ii</s>  woodcutting and etching for serious purpose</s> the tendency of woodcutting in england has been to imitate the finenessand manner of engraving</s>  this is a false tendency and so far as theproductions obtained under its influence have been successful they areto be considered only as an inferior kind of engraving under the lasthead</s>  but the real power of woodcutting is with little labor toexpress in clear delineation the most impressive essential qualities ofform and light and shade in objects which owe their interest not tograce but to power and character</s>  it can never express beauty of thesubtlest kind and is not in any way available on a large scale butused rightly on its own ground it is the most purely intellectual ofall art sculpture even of the highest order being slightly sensualand imitative while fine woodcutting is entirely abstract thoughtfuland passionate</s>  the best woodcuts that i know in the whole range of artare those of drers life of the virgin after these come the otherworks of drer slightly inferior from a more complex and wiry treatmentof line</s>  i have never seen any other work in wood deserving to be namedwith his but the best vignettes of bewick approach drer in executionof plumage as nearly as a clowns work can approach a gentlemans</s> 109</s>  some very brilliant execution on an inferior systemless falsehowever than the modern english onehas been exhibited by the frenchand if we accept its false conditions nothing can surpass thecleverness of our own school of dalziel or even of the averagewoodcutting in our daily journals which however as aforesaid is onlyto be reckoned an inferior method of engraving</s>  these meet the demand ofthe imperfectlyeducated public in every kind and it would be absurd tourge any change in the method as long as the public remain in the samestate of knowledge or temper</s>  but allowing for the time during whichthese illustrated papers have now been bringing whatever information andexample of art they could to the million it seems likely that the saidmillion will remain in the same stage of knowledge yet for some time</s> perhaps the horse is an animal as antagonistic to art in england as hewas in harmony with it in greece still allowing for the generalintelligence of the london bred lower classes i was surprised by aparagraph in the pall mall gazette quoting the star of november 6thof last year in its report upon the use made of illustrated papers bythe omnibus stablemento the following effectthey are frequently employed in the omnibus yards from five oclock inthe morning till twelve at night so that a fair days work for

pickshers which delightedhim</s>  he amused himself during his mealtimes by counting the images</s> 110</s>  but for the classes among whom there is a real demand foreducational art it is highly singular that no systematic use has yetbeen made of woodcutting on its own terms and only here and thereeven in the best books is there an example of what might be done by it</s> the frontispieces to

ofcommon books</s>  but his father can give him nothing of the kindand ifthe father himself wish to study greek art he must spend something likea hundred pounds to put himself in possession of any sufficientlyillustrative books of reference</s>  as to any use of such means forrepresenting objects in the round the plate of the head of pallasfacing p</s>  168 in the same volume sufficiently shows the hopelessness ofsetting the modern engraver to such service</s>  again in a book likesmiths dictionary of geography the woodcuts of coins are at presentuseful only for comparison and reference</s>  they are absolutely valuelessas representations of the art of the coin</s> 111</s>  now supposing that an educated scholar and draughtsman had drawneach of these blocks and that they had been cut with as much averageskill as that employed in the woodcuts of punch each of thesevignettes of coins might have been an exquisite lesson both of high arttreatment in the coin and of beautiful black and white drawing in therepresentation and this just as cheaplynay more cheaplythan thepresent common and useless drawing</s>  the things necessary are indeed notsmallnothing less than well educated intellect and feeling in thedraughtsmen but intellect and feeling as i have often said before noware always to be had cheap if you go the right way about itand theycannot otherwise be had for any price</s>  there are quite brains enoughand there is quite sentiment enough among the gentlemen of england toanswer all the purposes of england but if you so train your youths ofthe richer classes that they shall think it more gentlemanly to scrawl afigure on a bit of note paper to be presently rolled up to light acigar with than to draw one nobly and rightly for the seeing of allmenand if you practically show your youths of all classes that theywill be held gentlemen for babbling with a simper in sunday pulpits orgrinning through not a horses but a hounds collar in saturdayjournals or dirtily living on the public money in governmentnonofficesbut that they shall be held less than gentlemen for doinga mans work honestly with a mans right handyou will of course findthat intellect and feeling cannot be had when you want them</s>  but if youlike to train some of your best youth into scholarly artistsmen ofthe temper of leonardo of holbein of drer or of velasquez insteadof decomposing them into the early efflorescences and putrescences ofidle clerks sharp lawyers soft curates and rotten journalistsyouwill find that you can always get a good line drawn when you need itwithout paying large subscriptions to schools of art</s> 112</s>  iii</s>  this relation of social character to the possible supplyof good art is still more direct when we include in our survey

and imperfect lines areoften sufficient and that in this direction lies the only opening forthe serviceable presentation of amateur work to public notice</s> 113</s>  i have said nothing of lithography because with the exception ofsamuel prouts sketches no work of standard artvalue has ever beenproduced by it nor can be its opaque and gritty texture being whollyoffensive to the eye of

are sometimes to be thanked for rendering possible thepublication of sketches like those of the pretty little voyage enzigzag how we spent the summer published by longmanswhich arefull of charming humor character and freshness of expression andmight have lost more by the reduction to the severe terms ofwoodcutting than they do by the ragged interruptions of line which arean inevitable defect in nearly all these cheap processes</s>  it will beenough therefore for all serious purpose that we confine ourselvesto the study of the black line as produced in steel and wood and iwill endeavor in the
