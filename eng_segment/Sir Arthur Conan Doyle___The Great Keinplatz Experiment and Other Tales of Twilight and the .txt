famous indian surgeonmade me his heir and that his death changed me in an hour from ahardworking and impecunious medical man to a welltodo landedproprietor</s>  many know also that there were at least five people betweenthe inheritance and me and that sir dominicks selection appeared to bealtogether arbitrary and whimsical</s>  i can assure them however thatthey are quite mistaken and that although i only knew sir dominick inthe closing years of his life there were none the less very realreasons why he should show his goodwill towards me</s>  as a matter of factthough i say it myself no man ever did more for another than i did formy indian uncle</s>  i cannot expect the story to be believed but it is sosingular that i should feel that it was a breach of duty if i did notput it upon recordso here it is and your belief or incredulity isyour own affair</s> sir dominick holden c</s> b</s>  k</s> c</s> s</s> i</s>  and i dont know what besides wasthe most distinguished indian surgeon of his day</s>  in the armyoriginally he afterwards settled down into civil practice in bombayand visited as a consultant every part of india</s>  his name is bestremembered in connection with the oriental hospital which he foundedand supported</s>  the time came however when his iron constitution beganto show signs of the long strain to which he had subjected it and hisbrother practitioners who were not perhaps entirely disinterestedupon the point were unanimous in recommending him to return to england</s> he held on so long as he could but at last he developed nervoussymptoms of a very pronounced character and so came back a broken manto his native county of wiltshire</s>  he bought a considerable estate withan ancient manorhouse upon the edge of salisbury plain and devoted hisold age to the study of comparative pathology which had been hislearned hobby all his life and in which he was a foremost authority</s> we of the family were as may be imagined much excited by the news ofthe return of this rich and childless uncle to england</s>  on his partalthough by no means exuberant in his hospitality he showed some senseof his duty to his relations and each of us in turn had an invitationto visit him</s>  from the accounts of my cousins it appeared to be amelancholy business and it was with mixed feelings that i at lastreceived my own summons to appear at rodenhurst</s>  my wife was socarefully excluded in the invitation that my first impulse was to refuseit but the interests of the children had to be considered and so withher consent i set out one october afternoon upon my visit to wiltshirewith little thought of what that visit was to entail</s> my uncles estate was situated where the arable land of the plainsbegins to swell upwards into the rounded chalk hills which arecharacteristic of the county</s>  as i drove from dinton station in thewaning light of that autumn day i was impressed by the weird nature ofthe scenery</s>  the few scattered cottages of the peasants were so dwarfedby the huge evidences of prehistoric life that the present appeared tobe a dream and the past to be the obtrusive and masterful reality</s>  theroad wound through the valleys formed by a succession of grassy hillsand the summit of each was cut and carved into the most elaboratefortifications some circular and some square but all on a scale whichhas defied the winds and the rains of many centuries</s>  some call themroman and some british but their true origin and the reasons for thisparticular tract of country being so interlaced with entrenchments havenever been finally made clear</s>  here and there on the long smootholivecoloured slopes there rose small rounded barrows or tumuli</s> beneath them lie the cremated ashes of the race which cut so deeply intothe hills but their graves tell us nothing save that a jar full of dustrepresents the man who once laboured under the sun</s> it was through this weird country that i approached my uncles residenceof rodenhurst and the house was as i found in due keeping with itssurroundings</s>  two broken and weatherstained pillars each surmounted bya mutilated heraldic emblem flanked the entrance to a neglected drive</s> a cold wind whistled through the elms which lined it and the air wasfull of the drifting leaves</s>  at the far end under the gloomy arch oftrees a single yellow lamp burned steadily</s>  in the dim halflight ofthe coming night i saw a long low building stretching out two irregularwings with deep eaves a sloping gambrel roof and walls which werecrisscrossed with timber balks in the fashion of the tudors</s>  the cheerylight of a fire flickered in the broad latticed window to the left ofthe lowporched door and this as it proved marked the study of myuncle for it was thither that i was led by his butler in order to makemy hosts acquaintance</s> he was cowering over his fire for the moist chill of an english autumnhad set him shivering</s>  his lamp was unlit and i only saw the red glowof the embers beating upon a huge craggy face with a red indian noseand cheek and deep furrows and seams from eye to chin the sinistermarks of hidden volcanic fires</s>  he sprang up at my entrance withsomething of an oldworld courtesy and welcomed me warmly to rodenhurst</s> at the same time i was conscious as the lamp was carried in that itwas a very critical pair of lightblue eyes which looked out at me fromunder shaggy eyebrows like scouts beneath a bush and that thisoutlandish uncle of mine was carefully reading off my character with allthe ease of a practised observer and an experienced man of the world</s> for my part i looked at him and looked again for i had never seen aman whose appearance was more fitted to hold ones attention</s>  his figurewas the framework of a giant but he had fallen away until his coatdangled straight down in a shocking fashion from a pair of broad andbony shoulders</s>  all his limbs were huge and yet emaciated and i couldnot take my gaze from his knobby wrists and long gnarled hands</s>  buthis eyesthose peering lightblue eyesthey were the most arrestiveof any of his peculiarities</s>  it was not their colour alone nor was itthe ambush of hair in which they lurked but it was the expression whichi read in them</s>  for the appearance and bearing of the man weremasterful and one expected a certain corresponding arrogance in hiseyes but instead of that i read the look which tells of a spirit cowedand crushed the furtive expectant look of the dog whose master hastaken the whip from the rack</s>  i formed my own medical diagnosis upon oneglance at those critical and yet appealing eyes</s>  i believed that he wasstricken with some mortal ailment that he knew himself to be exposed tosudden death and that he lived in terror of it</s>  such was my judgmentafalse one as the event showed but i mention it that it may help you torealise the look which i read in his eyes</s> my uncles welcome was as i have said a courteous one and in an houror so i found myself seated between him and his wife at a comfortabledinner with curious pungent delicacies upon the table and a stealthyquickeyed oriental waiter behind his chair</s>  the old couple had comeround to that tragic imitation of the dawn of life when husband andwife having lost or scattered all those who were their intimates findthemselves face to face and alone once more their work done and theend nearing fast</s>  those who have reached that stage in sweetness andlove who can change their winter into a gentle indian summer have comeas victors through the ordeal of life</s>  lady holden was a small alertwoman with a kindly eye and her expression as she glanced at him was acertificate of character to her husband</s>  and yet though i read amutual love in their glances i read also mutual horror and recognisedin her face some reflection of that stealthy fear which i had detectedin his</s>  their talk was sometimes merry and sometimes sad but there wasa forced note in their merriment and a naturalness in their sadnesswhich told me that a heavy heart beat upon either side of me</s> we were sitting over our first glass of wine and the servants had leftthe room when the conversation took a turn which produced a remarkableeffect upon my host and hostess</s>  i cannot recall what it was whichstarted the topic of the supernatural but it ended in my showing themthat the abnormal in psychical experiences was a subject to which i hadlike many neurologists devoted a great deal of attention</s>  i concludedby narrating my experiences when as a member of the psychical researchsociety i had formed one of a committee of three who spent the night ina haunted house</s>  our adventures were neither exciting nor convincingbut such as it was the story appeared to interest my auditors in aremarkable degree</s>  they listened with an eager silence and i caught alook of intelligence between them which i could not understand</s>  ladyholden immediately afterwards rose and left the room</s> sir dominick pushed the cigarbox over to me and we smoked for somelittle time in silence</s>  that huge bony hand of his was twitching as heraised it with his cheroot to his lips and i felt that the mans nerveswere vibrating like fiddlestrings</s>  my instincts told me that he was onthe verge of some intimate confidence and i feared to speak lest ishould interrupt it</s>  at last he turned towards me with a spasmodicgesture like a man who throws his last scruple to the winds</s> from the little that i have seen of you it appears to me dr</s> hardacre said he that you are the very man i have wanted to meet</s> i am delighted to hear it sir</s> your head seems to be cool and steady</s>  you will acquit me of any desireto flatter you for the circumstances are too serious to permit ofinsincerities</s>  you have some special knowledge upon these subjects andyou evidently view them from that philosophical standpoint which robsthem of all vulgar terror</s>  i presume that the sight of an apparitionwould not seriously discompose you</s> i think not sir</s> would even interest you perhaps</s> most intensely</s> as a psychical observer you would probably investigate it in asimpersonal a fashion as an astronomer investigates a wandering comet</s> precisely</s> he gave a heavy sigh</s> believe me dr</s>  hardacre there was a time when i could have spoken asyou do now</s>  my nerve was a byword in india</s>  even the mutiny never shookit for an instant</s>  and yet you see what i am reduced tothe mosttimorous man perhaps in all this county of wiltshire</s>  do not speak toobravely upon this subject or you may find yourself subjected to aslongdrawn a test as i ama test which can only end in the madhouse orthe grave</s> i waited patiently until he should see fit to go farther in hisconfidence</s>  his preamble had i need not say filled me with interestand expectation</s> for some years dr</s>  hardacre he continued my life and that of mywife have been made miserable by a cause which is so grotesque that itborders upon the ludicrous</s>  and yet familiarity has never made it moreeasy to bearon the contrary as time passes my nerves become more wornand shattered by the constant attrition</s>  if you have no physical fearsdr</s>  hardacre i should very much value your opinion upon this phenomenonwhich troubles us so</s> for what it is worth my opinion is entirely at your service</s>  may i askthe nature of the phenomenon</s> i think that your experiences will have a higher evidential value ifyou are not told in advance what you may expect to encounter</s>  you areyourself aware of the quibbles of unconscious cerebration and subjectiveimpressions with which a scientific sceptic may throw a doubt upon yourstatement</s>  it would be as well to guard against them in advance</s> what shall i do then</s> i will tell you</s>  would you mind following me this way</s>  he led me outof the diningroom and down a long passage until we came to a terminaldoor</s>  inside there was a large bare room fitted as a laboratory withnumerous scientific instruments and bottles</s>  a shelf ran along one sideupon which there stood a long line of glass jars containing pathologicaland anatomical specimens</s> you see that i still dabble in some of my old studies said sirdominick</s>  these jars are the remains of what was once a most excellentcollection but unfortunately i lost the greater part of them when myhouse was burned down in bombay in 92</s>  it was a most unfortunate affairfor mein more ways than one</s>  i had examples of many rare conditionsand my splenic collection was probably unique</s>  these are the survivors</s> i glanced over them and saw that they really were of a very great valueand rarity from a pathological point of view bloated organs gapingcysts distorted bones odious parasitesa singular exhibition of theproducts of india</s> there is as you see a small settee here said my host</s>  it was farfrom our intention to offer a guest so meagre an accommodation butsince affairs have taken this turn it would be a great kindness uponyour part if you would consent to spend the night in this apartment</s>  ibeg that you will not hesitate to let me know if the idea should be atall repugnant to you</s> on the contrary i said it is most acceptable</s> my own room is the second on the left so that if you should feel thatyou are in need of company a call would always bring me to your side</s> i trust that i shall not be compelled to disturb you</s> it is unlikely that i shall be asleep</s>  i do not sleep much</s>  do nothesitate to summon me</s> and so with this agreement we joined lady holden in the drawingroom andtalked of lighter things</s> it was no affectation upon my part to say that the prospect of mynights adventure was an agreeable one</s>  i had no pretence to greaterphysical courage than my neighbours but familiarity with a subject robsit of those vague and undefined terrors which are the most appalling tothe imaginative mind</s>  the human brain is capable of only one strongemotion at a time and if it be filled with curiosity or scientificenthusiasm there is no room for fear</s>  it is true that i had my unclesassurance that he had himself originally taken this point of view but ireflected that the breakdown of his nervous system might be due to hisforty years in india as much as to any psychical experiences which hadbefallen him</s>  i at least was sound in nerve and brain and it was withsomething of the pleasurable thrill of anticipation with which thesportsman takes his position beside the haunt of his game that i shutthe laboratory door behind me and partially undressing lay down uponthe rugcovered settee</s> it was not an ideal atmosphere for a bedroom</s>  the air was heavy withmany chemical odours that of methylated spirit predominating</s>  nor werethe decorations of my chamber very sedative</s>  the odious line of glassjars with their relics of disease and suffering stretched in front of myvery eyes</s>  there was no blind to the window and a threequarter moonstreamed its white light into the room tracing a silver square withfiligree lattices upon the opposite wall</s>  when i had extinguished mycandle this one bright patch in the midst of the general gloom hadcertainly an eerie and discomposing aspect</s>  a rigid and absolute silencereigned throughout the old house so that the low swish of the branchesin the garden came softly and smoothly to my ears</s>  it may have been thehypnotic lullaby of this gentle susurrus or it may have been the resultof my tiring day but after many dozings and many efforts to regain myclearness of perception i fell at last into a deep and dreamlesssleep</s> i was awakened by some sound in the room and i instantly raised myselfupon my elbow on the couch</s>  some hours had passed for the square patchupon the wall had slid downwards and sideways until it lay obliquely atthe end of my bed</s>  the rest of the room was in deep shadow</s>  at first icould see nothing presently as my eyes became accustomed to the faintlight i was aware with a thrill which all my scientific absorptioncould not entirely prevent that something was moving slowly along theline of the wall</s>  a gentle shuffling sound as of soft slippers cameto my ears and i dimly discerned a human figure walking stealthily fromthe direction of the door</s>  as it emerged into the patch of moonlight isaw very clearly what it was and how it was employed</s>  it was a manshort and squat dressed in some sort of darkgrey gown which hungstraight from his shoulders to his feet</s>  the moon shone upon the side ofhis face and i saw that it was chocolatebrown in colour with a ballof black hair like a womans at the back of his head</s>  he walked slowlyand his eyes were cast upwards towards the line of bottles whichcontained those gruesome remnants of humanity</s>  he seemed to examine eachjar with attention and then to pass on to the next</s>  when he had come tothe end of the line immediately opposite my bed he stopped faced methrew up his hands with a gesture of despair and vanished from mysight</s> i have said that he threw up his hands but i should have said his armsfor as he assumed that attitude of despair i observed a singularpeculiarity about his appearance</s>  he had only one hand</s>  as the sleevesdrooped down from the upflung arms i saw the left plainly but the rightended in a knobby and unsightly stump</s>  in every other way his appearancewas so natural and i had both seen and heard him so clearly that icould easily have believed that he was an indian servant of sirdominicks who had come into my room in search of something</s>  it was onlyhis sudden disappearance which suggested anything more sinister to me</s> as it was i sprang from my couch lit a candle and examined the wholeroom carefully</s>  there were no signs of my visitor and i was forced toconclude that there had really been something outside the normal laws ofnature in his appearance</s>  i lay awake for the remainder of the nightbut nothing else occurred to disturb me</s> i am an early riser but my uncle was an even earlier one for i foundhim pacing up and down the lawn at the side of the house</s>  he ran towardsme in his eagerness when he saw me come out from the door</s> well well</s>  he cried</s>  did you see him</s> an indian with one hand</s> precisely</s> yes i saw himand i told him all that occurred</s>  when i had finishedhe led the way into his study</s>  we have a little time before breakfastsaid he</s>  it will suffice to give you an explanation of thisextraordinary affairso far as i can explain that which is essentiallyinexplicable</s>  in the first place when i tell you that for four years ihave never passed one single night either in bombay aboard ship orhere in england without my sleep being broken by this fellow you willunderstand why it is that i am a wreck of my former self</s>  his programmeis always the same</s>  he appears by my bedside shakes me roughly by theshoulder passes from my room into the laboratory walks slowly alongthe line of my bottles and then vanishes</s>  for more than a thousandtimes he has gone through the same routine</s> what does he want</s> he wants his hand</s> his hand</s> yes it came about in this way</s>  i was summoned to peshawur for aconsultation some ten years ago and while there i was asked to look atthe hand of a native who was passing through with an afghan caravan</s>  thefellow came from some mountain tribe living away at the back of beyondsomewhere on the other side of kaffiristan</s>  he talked a bastard pushtooand it was all i could do to understand him</s>  he was suffering from asoft sarcomatous swelling of one of the metacarpal joints and i madehim realise that it was only by losing his hand that he could hope tosave his life</s>  after much persuasion he consented to the operation andhe asked me when it was over what fee i demanded</s>  the poor fellow wasalmost a beggar so that the idea of a fee was absurd but i answered injest that my fee should be his hand and that i proposed to add it to mypathological collection</s> to my surprise he demurred very much to the suggestion and heexplained that according to his religion it was an allimportant matterthat the body should be reunited after death and so make a perfectdwelling for the spirit</s>  the belief is of course an old one and themummies of the egyptians arose from an analogous superstition</s>  ianswered him that his hand was already off and asked him how heintended to preserve it</s>  he replied that he would pickle it in salt andcarry it about with him</s>  i suggested that it might be safer in mykeeping than his and that i had better means than salt for preservingit</s>  on realising that i really intended to carefully keep it hisopposition vanished instantly</s>  but remember sahib said he i shallwant it back when i am dead</s>  i laughed at the remark and so the matterended</s>  i returned to my practice and he no doubt in the course of timewas able to continue his journey to afghanistan</s> well as i told you last night i had a bad fire in my house at bombay</s> half of it was burned down and among other things my pathologicalcollection was largely destroyed</s>  what you see are the poor remains ofit</s>  the hand of the hillman went with the rest but i gave the matter noparticular thought at the time</s>
 that was six years ago</s> four years agotwo years after the firei was awakened one night by afurious tugging at my sleeve</s>
 i sat up under the impression that myfavourite mastiff was trying to arouse me</s>  instead of this i saw myindian patient of long ago dressed in the long grey gown which was thebadge of his people</s>  he was holding up his stump and lookingreproachfully at me</s>  he then went over to my bottles which at that timei kept in my room and he examined them carefully after which he gave agesture of anger and vanished</s>  i realised that he had just died andthat he had come to claim my promise that i should keep his limb insafety for him</s> well there you have it all dr</s>  hardacre</s>  every night at the samehour for four years this performance has been repeated</s>  it is a simplething in itself but it has worn me out like water dropping on a stone</s> it has brought a vile insomnia with it for i cannot sleep now for theexpectation of his coming</s>  it has poisoned my old age and that of mywife who has been the sharer in this great trouble</s>  but there is thebreakfast gong and she will be waiting impatiently to know how it faredwith you last night</s>  we are both much indebted to you for yourgallantry for it takes something from the weight of our misfortune whenwe share it even for a single night with a friend and it reassures usas to our sanity which we are sometimes driven to question</s> this was the curious narrative which sir dominick confided to meastory which to many would have appeared to be a grotesque impossibilitybut which after my experience of the night before and my previousknowledge of such things i was prepared to accept as an absolute fact</s> i thought deeply over the matter and brought the whole range of myreading and experience to bear upon it</s>  after breakfast i surprised myhost and hostess by announcing that i was returning to london by thenext train</s> my dear doctor cried sir dominick in great distress you make mefeel that i have been guilty of a gross breach of hospitality inintruding this unfortunate matter upon you</s>  i should have borne my ownburden</s> it is indeed that matter which is taking me to london i answeredbut you are mistaken i assure you if you think that my experience oflast night was an unpleasant one to me</s>  on the contrary i am about toask your permission to return in the evening and spend one more night inyour laboratory</s>  i am very eager to see this visitor once again</s> my uncle was exceedingly anxious to know what i was about to do but myfears of raising false hopes prevented me from telling him</s>  i was backin my own consultingroom a little after luncheon and was confirming mymemory of a passage in a recent book upon occultism which had arrestedmy attention when i had read it</s> in the case of earthbound spirits said my authority some onedominant idea obsessing them at the hour of death is sufficient to holdthem in this material world</s>  they are the amphibia of this life and ofthe next capable of passing from one to the other as the turtle passesfrom land to water</s>  the causes which may bind a soul so strongly to alife which its body has abandoned are any violent emotion</s>  avaricerevenge anxiety love and pity have all been known to have thiseffect</s>  as a rule it springs from some unfulfilled wish and when thewish has been fulfilled the material bond relaxes</s>  there are many casesupon record which show the singular persistence of these visitors andalso their disappearance when their wishes have been fulfilled or insome cases when a reasonable compromise has been effected</s> a reasonable compromise effectedthose were the words which i hadbrooded over all the morning and which i now verified in the original</s> no actual atonement could be made herebut a reasonable compromise</s>  imade my way as fast as a train could take me to the shadwell seamenshospital where my old friend jack hewett was housesurgeon</s>  withoutexplaining the situation i made him understand what it was that iwanted</s> a brown mans hand</s>  said he in amazement</s>  what in the world do youwant that for</s> never mind</s>  ill tell you some day</s>  i know that your wards are full ofindians</s> i should think so</s>  but a hand he thought a little and then strucka bell</s> travers said he to a studentdresser what became of the hands ofthe lascar which we took off yesterday</s>  i mean the fellow from the eastindia dock who got caught in the steam winch</s> they are in the postmortem room sir</s> just pack one of them in antiseptics and give it to dr</s>  hardacre</s> and so i found myself back at rodenhurst before dinner with this curiousoutcome of my day in town</s>  i still said nothing to sir dominick but islept that night in the laboratory and i placed the lascars hand inone of the glass jars at the end of my couch</s> so interested was i in the result of my experiment that sleep was out ofthe question</s>  i sat with a shaded lamp beside me and waited patientlyfor my visitor</s>  this time i saw him clearly from the first</s>  he appearedbeside the door nebulous for an instant and then hardening into asdistinct an outline as any living man</s>  the slippers beneath his greygown were red and heelless which accounted for the low shuffling soundwhich he made as he walked</s>  as on the previous night he passed slowlyalong the line of bottles until he paused before that which containedthe hand</s>  he reached up to it his whole figure quivering withexpectation took it down examined it eagerly and then with a facewhich was convulsed with disappointment he hurled it down on the floor</s> there was a crash which resounded through the house and when i lookedup the mutilated indian had disappeared</s>  a moment later my door flewopen and sir dominick rushed in</s> you are not hurt</s>  he cried</s> nobut deeply disappointed</s> he looked in astonishment at the splinters of glass and the brown handlying upon the floor</s> good god</s>  he cried</s>  what is this</s> i told him my idea and its wretched sequel</s>  he listened intently butshook his head</s> it was well thought of said he but i fear that there is no sucheasy end to my sufferings</s>  but one thing i now insist upon</s>  it is thatyou shall never again upon any pretext occupy this room</s>  my fears thatsomething might have happened to youwhen i heard that crashhave beenthe most acute of all the agonies which i have undergone</s>  i will notexpose myself to a repetition of it</s> he allowed me however to spend the remainder of the night where i wasand i lay there worrying over the problem and lamenting my own failure</s> with the first light of morning there was the lascars hand still lyingupon the floor to remind me of my fiasco</s>  i lay looking at itand as ilay suddenly an idea flew like a bullet through my head and brought mequivering with excitement out of my couch</s>  i raised the grim relic fromwhere it had fallen</s>  yes it was indeed so</s>  the hand was the left handof the lascar</s> by the first train i was on my way to town and hurried at once to theseamens hospital</s>  i remembered that both hands of the lascar had beenamputated but i was terrified lest the precious organ which i was insearch of might have been already consumed in the crematory</s>  my suspensewas soon ended</s>  it had still been preserved in the postmortem room</s> and so i returned to rodenhurst in the evening with my missionaccomplished and the material for a fresh experiment</s> but sir dominick holden would not hear of my occupying the laboratoryagain</s>  to all my entreaties he turned a deaf ear</s>  it offended his senseof hospitality and he could no longer permit it</s>  i left the handtherefore as i had done its fellow the night before and i occupied acomfortable bedroom in another portion of the house some distance fromthe scene of my adventures</s> but in spite of that my sleep was not destined to be uninterrupted</s>  inthe dead of night my host burst into my room a lamp in his hand</s>  hishuge gaunt figure was enveloped in a loose dressinggown and his wholeappearance might certainly have seemed more formidable to a weaknervedman than that of the indian of the night before</s>  but it was not hisentrance so much as his expression which amazed me</s>  he had turnedsuddenly younger by twenty years at the least</s>  his eyes were shininghis features radiant and he waved one hand in triumph over his head</s>  isat up astounded staring sleepily at this extraordinary visitor</s>  buthis words soon drove the sleep from my eyes</s> we have done it</s>  we have succeeded</s>  he shouted</s>  my dear hardacre howcan i ever in this world repay you</s> you dont mean to say that it is all right</s> indeed i do</s>  i was sure that you would

how do you know that it is all right</s> have you seen something</s> he seated himself at the foot of my bed</s> i have seen enough said he</s>  it satisfies me that i shall be troubledno more</s>  what has passed is easily told</s>  you know that at a certain hourthis creature always comes to me</s>  tonight he arrived at the usual timeand aroused me with even more violence than is his custom</s>  i can onlysurmise that his disappointment of last night increased the bitternessof his anger against me</s>  he looked angrily at me and then went on hisusual round</s>  but in a few minutes i saw him for the first time sincethis persecution began return to my chamber</s>  he was smiling</s>  i saw thegleam of his white teeth through the dim light</s>  he stood facing me atthe end of my bed and three times he made the low eastern salaam whichis their solemn leavetaking</s>  and the third time that he bowed he raisedhis arms over his head and i saw his two hands outstretched in theair</s>  so he vanished and as i believe for ever</s>           so that is the curious experience which won me the affection and thegratitude of my celebrated uncle the famous indian surgeon</s>  hisanticipations were realised and never again was he disturbed by thevisits of the restless hillman in search of his lost member</s>  sirdominick and lady holden spent a very happy old age unclouded

washingbut thework is not onerous and you would have the evenings to yourself</s> that would do i cried with all the eagerness of the man who seeswork at last after weary months of seeking</s> i dont know that it is quite fair to these gentlemen whose names havebeen so long upon our list said mr</s>  lumsden glancing down at his openledger</s>  but the coincidence is so striking that i feel we must reallygive you the refusal of it</s> then i accept it sir and i am much obliged to you</s> there is one small provision in dr</s>  mccarthys letter</s>  he stipulatesthat the applicant must be a man with an imperturbable good temper</s> i am the very man said i with conviction</s> well said mr</s>  lumsden with some hesitation i hope that your temperis really as good as you say for i rather fancy that you may need it</s> i presume that every elementary schoolmaster does</s> yes sir but it is only fair to you to warn you that there may be someespecially trying circumstances in this particular situation</s>  dr</s>  phelpsmccarthy does not make such a condition without some very good andpressing reason</s> there was a certain solemnity in his speech which struck a chill in thedelight with which i had welcomed this providential vacancy</s> may i ask the nature of these circumstances</s>  i asked</s> we endeavour to hold the balance equally between our clients and to beperfectly frank with all of them</s>  if i knew of objections to you ishould certainly communicate them to dr</s>  mccarthy and so i have nohesitation in doing as much for you</s>  i find he continued glancingover the pages of his ledger that within the last twelve months wehave supplied no fewer than seven latin masters to willow lea houseacademy four of them having left so abruptly as to forfeit theirmonths salary and none of them having stayed more than eight weeks</s> and the other masters</s>  have they stayed</s> there is only one other residential master and he appears to beunchanged</s>  you can understand mr</s>  weld continued the agent closingboth the ledger and the interview that such rapid changes are notdesirable from a masters point of view whatever may be said for themby an agent working on commission</s>  i have no idea why these gentlemenhave resigned their situations so early</s>  i can only give you the factsand advise you to see dr</s>  mccarthy at once and to form your ownconclusions</s> great is the power of the man who has nothing to lose and it wastherefore with perfect serenity but with a good deal of curiosity thati rang early that afternoon the heavy wroughtiron bell of the willowlea house academy</s>  the building was a massive pile square and uglystanding in its own extensive grounds with a broad carriagesweepcurving up to it from the road</s>  it stood high and commanded a view onthe one side of the grey roofs and bristling spires of northern londonand on the other of the wellwooded and beautiful country which fringesthe great city</s>  the door was opened by a boy in buttons and i was showninto a wellappointed study where the principal of the academypresently joined me</s> the warnings and insinuations of the agent had prepared me to meet acholeric and overbearing personone whose manner was an insupportableprovocation to those who worked under him</s>  anything further from thereality cannot be imagined</s>  he was a frail gentle creaturecleanshaven and roundshouldered with a bearing which was so courteousthat it became almost deprecating</s>  his bushy hair was thickly shot withgrey and his age i should imagine to verge upon sixty</s>  his voice waslow and suave and he walked with a certain mincing delicacy of manner</s> his whole appearance was that of a kindly scholar who was more at homeamong his books than in the practical affairs of the world</s> i am sure that we shall be very happy to have your assistance mr</s> weld said he after a few professional questions</s>  mr</s>  percivalmanners left me yesterday and i should be glad if you could take overhis duties tomorrow</s> may i ask if that is mr</s>  percival manners of selwyn</s>  i asked</s> precisely</s>  did you know him</s> yes he is a friend of mine</s> an excellent teacher but a little hasty in his disposition</s>  it was hisonly fault</s>  now in your case mr</s>  weld is your own temper under goodcontrol</s>  supposing for arguments sake that i were to so far forgetmyself as to be rude to you or to speak roughly or to jar your feelingsin any way could you rely upon yourself to control your emotions</s> i smiled at the idea of this courteous little mincing creatureruffling my nerves</s> i think that i could answer for it sir said i</s> quarrels are very painful to me said he</s>  i wish every one to live inharmony under my roof</s>  i will not deny mr</s>  percival manners hadprovocation but i wish to find a man who can raise himself aboveprovocation and sacrifice his own feelings for the sake of peace andconcord</s> i will do my best sir</s> you cannot say more mr</s>  weld</s>  in that case i shall expect youtonight if you can get your things ready so soon</s> i not only succeeded in getting my things ready but i found time tocall at the benedict club in piccadilly where i knew that i should findmanners if he were still in town</s>  there he was sure enough in thesmokingroom and i questioned him over a cigarette as to his reasonsfor throwing up his recent situation</s> you dont tell me that you are going to dr</s>  phelps mccarthys academy</s> he cried staring at me in surprise</s>  my dear chap its no use</s>  youcant possibly remain there</s> but i saw him and he seemed the most courtly inoffensive fellow</s>  inever met a man with more gentle manners</s> he</s>  oh hes all right</s>  theres no vice in him</s>  have you seentheophilus st</s>  james</s> i have never heard the name</s>  who is he</s> your colleague</s>  the other master</s> no i have not seen him</s> hes the terror</s>  if you can stand him you have either the spirit ofa perfect christian or else you have no spirit at all</s>  a more perfectbounder never bounded</s> but why does mccarthy stand it</s> my friend looked at me significantly through his cigarette smoke andshrugged his shoulders</s> you will form your own conclusions about that</s>  mine were formed verysoon and i never found occasion to alter them</s> it would help me very much if you would tell me them</s> when you see a man in his own house allowing his business to be ruinedhis comfort destroyed and his authority defied by another man in asubordinate position and calmly submitting to it without so much as aword of protest what conclusion do you come to</s> that the one has a hold over the other</s> percival manners nodded his head</s> there you are</s>  youve hit it first barrel</s>  it seems to me that theresno other explanation which will cover the facts</s>  at some period in hislife the little doctor has gone astray</s>  humanum est errare</s>  i haveeven done it myself</s>  but this was something serious and the other mangot a hold of it and has never let go</s>  thats the truth</s>  blackmail is atthe bottom of it</s>  but he had no hold over me and there was no reasonwhy i should stand his insolence so i came awayand i very muchexpect to see you do the same</s> for some time he talked over the matter but he always came to the sameconclusionthat i should not retain my new situation very long</s> it was with no very pleasant feelings after this preparation that ifound myself face to face with the very man of whom i had received soevil an account</s>  dr</s>  mccarthy introduced us to each other in his studyon the evening of that same day immediately after my arrival at theschool</s> this is your new colleague mr</s>  st</s>  james said he in his genialcourteous fashion</s>  i trust that you will mutually agree and that ishall find nothing but good feeling and sympathy beneath this roof</s> i shared the good doctors hope but my expectations of it were notincreased by the appearance of my confrre</s>  he was a youngbullnecked fellow about thirty years of age darkeyed andblackhaired with an exceedingly vigorous physique</s>  i have never seena more strongly built man though he tended to run to fat in a way whichshowed that he was in the worst of training</s>  his face was coarseswollen and brutal with a pair of small black eyes deeply sunken inhis head</s>  his heavy jowl his projecting ears and his thick bandy legsall went to make up a personality which was as formidable as it wasrepellent</s> i hear youve never been out before said he in a rude brusquefashion</s>  well its a poor life hard work and starvation pay asyoull find out for yourself</s> but it has some compensations said the principal</s>  surely you willallow that mr</s>  st</s>  james</s> has it</s>  i never could find them</s>  what do you call compensations</s> even to be in the continual presence of youth is a privilege</s>  it hasthe effect of keeping youth in ones own soul for one reflectssomething of their high spirits and their keen enjoyment of life</s> little beasts</s>  cried my colleague</s> come come mr</s>  st</s>  james you are too hard upon them</s> i hate the sight of them</s>  if i could put them and their blessedcopybooks and lexicons and slates into one bonfire id do it tonight</s> this is mr</s>  st</s>  jamess way of talking said the principal smilingnervously as he glanced at me</s>  you must not take him too seriously</s> now mr</s>  weld you know where your room is and no doubt you have yourown little arrangements to make</s>  the sooner you make them the sooner youwill feel yourself at home</s> it seemed to me that he was only too anxious to remove me at once fromthe influence of this extraordinary colleague and i was glad to go forthe conversation had become embarrassing</s> and so began an epoch which always seems to me as i look back to it tobe the most singular in all my experience</s>  the school was in many waysan excellent one</s>  dr</s>  phelps mccarthy was an ideal principal</s>  hismethods were modern and rational</s>  the management was all that could bedesired</s>  and yet in the middle of this wellordered machine thereintruded the incongruous and impossible mr</s>  st</s>  james throwingeverything into confusion</s>  his duties were to teach english andmathematics and how he acquitted himself of them i do not know as ourclasses were held in separate rooms</s>  i can answer for it however thatthe boys feared him and loathed him and i know that they had goodreason to do so for frequently my own teaching was interrupted by hisbellowing of anger and even by the sound of his blows</s>  dr</s>  mccarthyspent most of his time in his class but it was i suspect to watchover the master rather than the boys and to try to moderate hisferocious temper when it threatened to become dangerous</s> it was in his bearing to the head master however that my colleaguesconduct was most outrageous</s>  the first conversation which i haverecorded proved to be typical of their intercourse</s>  he domineered overhim openly and brutally</s>  i have heard him contradict him roughly beforethe whole school</s>  at no time would he show him any mark of respect andmy temper often rose within me when i saw the quiet acquiescence of theold doctor and his patient tolerance of this monstrous treatment</s>  andyet the sight of it surrounded the principal also with a certain vaguehorror in my mind for supposing my friends theory to be correctand icould devise no better onehow black must have been the story whichcould be held over his head by this man and by fear of its publicityforce him to undergo such humiliations</s>  this quiet gentle doctor mightbe a profound hypocrite a criminal a forger possibly or a poisoner</s> only such a secret as this could account for the complete power whichthe younger man held over him</s>  why else should he admit so hateful apresence into his house and so harmful an influence into his school</s>  whyshould he submit to degradations which could not be witnessed far lessendured without indignation</s> and yet if it were so i was forced to confess that my principalcarried it off with extraordinary duplicity</s>  never by word or sign didhe show that the young mans presence was distasteful to him</s>  i haveseen him look pained it is true after some peculiarly outrageousexhibition but he gave me the impression that it was always on accountof the scholars or of me never on account of himself</s>  he spoke to andof st</s>  james in an indulgent fashion smiling gently at what made myblood boil within me</s>  in his way of looking at him and addressing himone could see no trace of resentment but rather a sort of timid anddeprecating good will</s>  his company he certainly courted and they spentmany hours together in the study and the garden</s> as to my own relations with theophilus st</s>  james i made up my mind fromthe beginning that i should keep my temper with him and to thatresolution i steadfastly adhered</s>  if dr</s>  mccarthy chose to permit thisdisrespect and to condone these outrages it was his affair and notmine</s>  it was evident that his one wish was that there should be peacebetween us and i felt that i could help him best by respecting thisdesire</s>  my easiest way to do so was to avoid my colleague and this idid to the best of my ability</s>  when we were thrown together i was quietpolite and reserved</s>  he on his part showed me no illwill but met merather with a coarse joviality and a rough familiarity which he meantto be ingratiating</s>  he was insistent in his attempts to get me into hisroom at night for the purpose of playing euchre and of drinking</s> old mccarthy doesnt mind said he</s>  dont you be afraid of him</s>  welldo what we like and ill answer for it that he wont object</s>  once onlyi went and when i left after a dull and gross evening my host wasstretched dead drunk upon the sofa</s>  after that i gave the excuse of acourse of study and spent my spare hours alone in my own room</s> one point upon which i was anxious to gain information was as to howlong these proceedings had been going on</s>  when did st</s>  james assert hishold over dr</s>  mccarthy</s>  from neither of them could i learn how long mycolleague had been in his present situation</s>  one or two leadingquestions upon my part were eluded or ignored in a manner so marked thatit was easy to see that they were both of them as eager to conceal thepoint as i was to know it</s>  but at last one evening i had the chance of achat with mrs</s>  carter the matronfor the doctor was a widowerandfrom her i got the information which i wanted</s>  it needed no questioningto get at her knowledge for she was so full of indignation that sheshook with passion as she spoke of it and raised her hands into the airin the earnestness of her denunciation as she described the grievanceswhich she had against my colleague</s>
it was three years ago mr</s>  weld that he first darkened thisdoorstep she cried</s>  three bitter years they have been to me</s>  theschool had fifty boys then</s>  now it has twentytwo</s>  thats what he hasdone for us in three years</s>
 in another three there wont be one</s>  and thedoctor that angel of patience you see how he treats him though he isnot fit to lace his boots for him</s>  if it wasnt for the doctor you maybe sure that i wouldnt stay an hour under the same roof with such aman and so i told him to his own face mr</s>  weld</s>  if the doctor wouldonly pack him about his businessbut i know that i am saying more thani should</s>  she stopped herself with an effort and spoke no more uponthe subject</s>  she had remembered that i was almost a stranger in theschool and she feared that she had been indiscreet</s> there were one or two very singular points about my colleague</s>  the chiefone was that he rarely took any exercise</s>  there was a playingfieldwithin the college grounds and that was his farthest point</s>  if the boyswent out it was i or dr</s>  mccarthy who accompanied them</s>  st</s>  james gaveas a reason for this that he had injured his knee some years before andthat walking was painful to him</s>  for my own part i put it down to purelaziness upon his part for he was of an obese heavy temperament</s> twice however i saw him from my window stealing out of the groundslate at night and the second time i watched him return in the grey ofthe morning and slink in through an open window</s>  these furtiveexcursions were never alluded to but they exposed the hollowness of hisstory about his knee and they increased the dislike and distrust whichi had of the man</s>  his nature seemed to be vicious to the core</s> another point small but suggestive was that he hardly ever during themonths that i was at willow lea house received any letters and on thosefew occasions they were obviously tradesmens bills</s>  i am an earlyriser and used every morning to pick my own correspondence out of thebundle upon the hall table</s>  i could judge therefore how few were everthere for mr</s>  theophilus st</s>  james</s>  there seemed to me to be somethingpeculiarly ominous in this</s>  what sort of a man could he be who duringthirty years of his life had never made a single friend high or lowwho cared to continue to keep in touch with him</s>  and yet the sinisterfact remained that the head master not only tolerated but was evenintimate with him</s>  more than once on entering a room i had found themtalking confidentially together and they would walk arm in arm in deepconversation up and down the garden paths</s>  so curious did i become toknow what the tie was which bound them that i found it gradually pushout my other interests and become the main purpose of my life</s>  in schooland out of school at meals and at play i was perpetually engaged inwatching dr</s>  phelps mccarthy and mr</s>  theophilus st</s>  james and inendeavouring to solve the mystery which surrounded them</s> but unfortunately my curiosity was a little too open</s>  i had not theart to conceal the suspicions which i felt about the relations whichexisted between these two men and the nature of the hold which the oneappeared to have over the other</s>  it may have been my manner of watchingthem it may have been some indiscreet question but it is certain thati showed too clearly what i felt</s>  one night i was conscious that theeyes of theophilus st</s>  james were fixed upon me in a surly and menacingstare</s>  i had a foreboding of evil and i was not surprised when dr</s> mccarthy called me next morning into his study</s> i am very sorry mr</s>  weld said he but i am afraid that i shall becompelled to dispense with your services</s> perhaps you would give me some reason for dismissing me i answeredfor i was conscious of having done my duties to the best of my powerand knew well that only one reason could be given</s> i have no fault to find with you said he and the colour came to hischeeks</s> you send me away at the suggestion of my colleague</s> his eyes turned away from mine</s> we will not discuss the question mr</s>  weld</s>  it is impossible for me todiscuss it</s>  in justice to you i will give you the strongestrecommendation for your next situation</s>  i can say no more</s>  i hope thatyou will continue your duties here until you have found a placeelsewhere</s> my whole soul rose against the injustice of it and yet i had no appealand no redress</s>  i could only bow and leave the room with a bitter senseof illusage at my heart</s> my first instinct was to pack my boxes and leave the house</s>  but thehead master had given me permission to remain until i had found anothersituation</s>  i was sure that st</s>  james desired me to go and that was astrong reason why i should stay</s>  if my presence annoyed him i shouldgive him as much of it as i could</s>  i had begun to hate him and to longto have my revenge upon him</s>  if he had a hold over our principal mightnot i in turn obtain one over him</s>  it was a sign of weakness that heshould be so afraid of my curiosity</s>  he would not resent it so much ifhe had not something to fear from it</s>  i entered my name once more uponthe books of the agents but meanwhile i continued to fulfil my dutiesat willow lea house and so it came about that i was present at thednouement of this singular situation</s> during that weekfor it was only a week before the crisis camei wasin the habit of going down each evening after the work of the day wasdone to inquire about my new arrangements</s>  one night it was a cold andwindy evening in march i had just stepped out from the hall door when astrange sight met my eyes</s>  a man was crouching before one of the windowsof the house</s>  his knees were bent and his eyes were fixed upon the smallline of light between the curtain and the sash</s>  the window threw asquare of brightness in front of it and in the middle of this the darkshadow of this ominous visitor showed clear and hard</s>  it was but for aninstant that i saw him for he glanced up and was off in a momentthrough the shrubbery</s>  i could hear the patter of his feet as he randown the road until it died away in the distance</s> it was evidently my duty to turn back and to tell dr</s>  mccarthy what ihad seen</s>  i found him in his study</s>  i had expected him to be disturbedat such an incident but i was not prepared for the state of panic intowhich he fell</s>  he leaned back in his chair white and gasping like onewho has received a mortal blow</s> which window mr</s>  weld</s>  he asked wiping his forehead</s>  which windowwas it</s> the next to the diningroommr</s>  st</s>  jamess window</s> dear me</s>  dear me</s>  this is indeed unfortunate</s>  a man looking throughmr</s>  st</s>  jamess window</s>  he wrung his hands like a man who is at hiswits end what to do</s> i shall be passing the policestation sir</s>  would you wish me tomention the matter</s> no no he cried suddenly mastering his extreme agitation i haveno doubt that it was some poor tramp who intended to beg</s>  i attach noimportance to the incidentnone at all</s>  dont let me detain you mr</s> weld if you wish to go out</s> i left him sitting in his study with reassuring words upon his lips butwith horror upon his face</s>  my heart was heavy for my little employer asi started off once more for town</s>  as i looked back from the gate at thesquare of light which marked the window of my colleague i suddenly sawthe black outline of dr</s>  mccarthys figure passing against the lamp</s>  hehad hastened from his study then to tell st</s>  james what he had heard</s> what was the meaning of it all this atmosphere of mystery thisinexplicable terror these confidences between two such dissimilar men</s> i thought and thought as i walked but do what i would i could not hitupon any adequate conclusion</s>  i little knew how near i was to thesolution of the problem</s> it was very latenearly twelve oclockwhen i returned and the lightswere all out save one in the doctors study</s>  the black gloomy houseloomed before me as i walked up the drive its sombre bulk broken onlyby the one glimmering point of brightness</s>  i let myself in with mylatchkey and was about to enter my own room when my attention wasarrested by a short sharp cry like that of a man in pain</s>  i stood andlistened my hand upon the handle of my door</s> all was silent in the house save for a distant murmur of voices whichcame i knew from the doctors room</s>  i stole quietly down the corridorin that direction</s>  the sound resolved itself now into two voices therough bullying tones of st</s>  james and the lower tone of the doctor theone apparently insisting and the other arguing and pleading</s>  four thinlines of light in the blackness showed me the door of the doctors roomand step by step i drew nearer to it in the darkness</s>  st</s>  jamess voicewithin rose louder and louder and his words came plainly to my ear</s> ill have every pound of it</s>  if you wont give it me ill take it</s>  doyou hear</s> dr</s>  mccarthys reply was inaudible but the angry voice broke in again</s> leave you destitute</s>  i leave you this little goldmine of a school andthats enough for one old man is it not</s>  how am i to set up inaustralia without money</s>  answer me that</s> again the doctor said something in a soothing voice but his answer onlyroused his companion to a higher pitch of fury</s> done for me</s>  what have you ever done for me except what you couldnthelp doing</s>  it was for your good name not for my safety that youcared</s>  but enough cackle</s>  i must get on my way before morning</s>  will youopen your safe or will you not</s> oh james how can you use me so</s>  cried a wailing voice and thenthere came a sudden little scream of pain</s>  at the sound of that helplessappeal from brutal violence i lost for once that temper upon which i hadprided myself</s>  every bit of manhood in me cried out against any furtherneutrality</s>  with my walking cane in my hand i rushed into the study</s>  asi did so i was conscious that the halldoor bell was violently ringing</s> you villain</s>  i cried let him go</s> the two men were standing in front of a small safe which stood againstone wall of the doctors room</s>  st</s>  james held the old man by the wristand he had twisted his arm round in order to force him to produce thekey</s>  my little head master white but resolute was struggling furiouslyin the grip of the burly athlete</s>  the bully glared over his shoulder atme with a mixture of fury and terror upon his brutal features</s>  thenrealising that i was alone he dropped his victim and made for me with ahorrible curse</s> you infernal spy</s>  he cried</s>  ill do for you anyhow before i leave</s> i am not a very strong man and i realised that i was helpless if onceat close quarters</s>  twice i cut at him with my stick but he rushed in atme with a murderous growl and seized me by the throat with both hismuscular hands</s>  i fell backwards and he on the top of me with a gripwhich was squeezing the life from me</s>  i was conscious of his malignantyellowtinged eyes within a few inches of my own and then with abeating of pulses in my head and a singing in my ears my senses slippedaway from me</s>  but even in that supreme moment i was aware that thedoorbell was still violently ringing</s> when i came to myself i was lying upon the sofa in dr</s>  mccarthysstudy and the doctor himself was seated beside me</s>  he appeared to bewatching me intently and anxiously for as i opened my eyes and lookedabout me he gave a great cry of relief</s>  thank god</s>  he cried</s>  thankgod</s> where is he</s>  i asked looking round the room</s>  as i did so i becameaware that the furniture was scattered in every direction and thatthere were traces of an even more violent struggle than that in which ihad been engaged</s> the doctor sank his face between his hands</s> they have him he groaned</s>  after these years of trial they have himagain</s>  but how thankful i am that he has not for a second time stainedhis hands in blood</s> as the doctor spoke i became aware that a man in the braided jacket ofan inspector of police was standing in the doorway</s> yes sir he remarked you have had a pretty narrow escape</s>  if we hadnot got in when we did you would not be here to tell the tale</s>  i dontknow that i ever saw any one much nearer to the undertaker</s> i sat up with my hands to my throbbing head</s> dr</s>  mccarthy said i this is all a mystery to me</s>  i should be gladif you could explain to me who this man is and why you have toleratedhim so long in your house</s> i owe you an explanation mr</s>  weldand the more so since you have inso chivalrous a fashion almost sacrificed your life in my defence</s> there is no reason now for secrecy</s>  in a word mr</s>  weld this unhappymans real name is james mccarthy and he is my only son</s> your son</s> alas yes</s>  what sin have i ever committed that i should have such apunishment</s>  he has made my whole life a misery from the first years ofhis boyhood</s>  violent headstrong selfish unprincipled he has alwaysbeen the same</s>  at eighteen he was a criminal</s>  at twenty in a paroxysmof passion he took the life of a boon companion and was tried formurder</s>  he only just escaped the gallows and he was condemned to penalservitude</s>  three years ago he succeeded in escaping and managed inface of a thousand obstacles to reach my house in london</s>  my wifesheart had been broken by his condemnation and as he had succeeded ingetting a suit of ordinary clothes there was no one here to recognisehim</s>  for months he lay concealed in the attics until the first search ofthe police should be over</s>  then i gave him employment here as you haveseen though by his rough and overbearing manners he made my own lifemiserable and that of his fellowmasters unbearable</s>  you have been withus for four months mr</s>  weld but no other master endured him so long</s>  iapologise now for all you have had to submit to but i ask you what elsecould i do</s>  for his dead mothers sake i could not let harm come to himas long as it was in my power to fend it off</s>  only under my roof couldhe find a refugethe only spot in all the worldand how could i keephim here without it exciting remark unless i gave him some occupation</s>  imade him english master therefore and in that capacity i have protectedhim here for three years</s>  you have no doubt observed that he neverduring the daytime went beyond the college grounds</s>  you now understandthe reason</s>  but when tonight you came to me with your report of a manwho was looking through his window i understood that his retreat was atlast discovered</s>  i besought him to fly at once but he had beendrinking the unhappy fellow and my words fell upon deaf ears</s>  when atlast he made up his mind to go he wished to take from me in his flightevery shilling which i possessed</s>  it was your entrance which saved mefrom him while the police in turn arrived only just in time to rescueyou</s>  i have made myself amenable to the law by harbouring an escapedprisoner and remain here in the custody of the inspector but a prisonhas no terrors for me after what i have endured in this house during thelast three years</s> it seems to me doctor said the inspector that if you have brokenthe law you have had quite enough punishment already</s> god knows i have</s>  cried dr</s>  mccarthy and sank his haggard face uponhis hands</s> iiib</s>  24i told my story when i was taken and no one would listen to me</s>  then itold it again at the trialthe whole thing absolutely as it happenedwithout so much as a word added</s>  i set it all out truly so help me godall that lady mannering said and did and then all that i had said anddone just as it occurred</s>  and what did i get for it</s>  the prisoner putforward a rambling and inconsequential statement incredible in itsdetails and unsupported by any shred of corroborative evidence</s>  thatwas what one of the london papers said and others let it pass as if ihad made no defence at all</s>  and yet with my own eyes i saw lordmannering murdered and i am as guiltless of it as any man on the jurythat tried me</s> now sir you are there to receive the petitions of prisoners</s>  it alllies with you</s>  all i ask is that you read itjust read itand thenthat you make an inquiry or two about the private character of thislady mannering if she still keeps the name that she had three yearsago when to my sorrow and ruin i came to meet her</s>  you could use aprivate inquiry agent or a good lawyer and you would soon learn enoughto show you that my story is the true one</s>  think of the glory it wouldbe to you to have all the papers saying that there would have been ashocking miscarriage of justice if it had not been for your perseveranceand intelligence</s>  that must be your reward since i am a poor man andcan offer you nothing</s>  but if you dont do it may you never lie easy inyour bed again</s>  may no night pass that you are not haunted by thethought of the man who rots in gaol because you have not done the dutywhich you are paid to do</s>  but you will do it sir i know</s>  just make oneor two inquiries and you will soon find which way the wind blows</s> remember also that the only person who profited by the crime washerself since it changed her from an unhappy wife to a rich youngwidow</s>  theres the end of the string in your hand and you only have tofollow it up and see where it leads to</s> mind you sir i make no complaint as far as the burglary goes</s>  i dontwhine about what i have deserved and so far i have had no more than ihave deserved</s>  burglary it was right enough and my three years havegone to pay for it</s>  it was shown at the trial that i had had a hand inthe merton cross business and did a year for that so my story had theless attention on that account</s>  a man with a previous conviction nevergets a really fair trial</s>  i own to the burglary but when it comes tothe murder which brought me a liferany judge but sir james might havegiven me the gallowsthen i tell you that i had nothing to do with itand that i am an innocent man</s>  and now ill take that night the 13th ofseptember 1894 and ill give you just exactly what occurred and maygods hand strike me down if i go one inch over the truth</s> i had been at bristol in the summer looking for work and then i had anotion that i might get something at portsmouth for i was trained as askilled mechanic so i came tramping my way across the south ofengland and doing odd jobs as i went</s>  i was trying all i knew to keepoff the cross for i had done a year in exeter gaol and i had hadenough of visiting queen victoria</s>  but its cruel hard to get work whenonce the black mark is against your name and it was all i could do tokeep soul and body together</s>  at last after ten days of woodcutting andstonebreaking on starvation pay i found myself near salisbury with acouple of shillings in my pocket and my boots and my patience cleanwore out</s>  theres an alehouse called the willing mind which standson the road between blandford and salisbury and it was there that nighti engaged a bed</s>  i was sitting alone in the taproom just about closingtime when the innkeeperallen his name wascame beside me and beganyarning about the neighbours</s>  he was a man that liked to talk and tohave some one to listen to his talk so i sat there smoking and drinkinga mug of ale which he had stood me and i took no great interest in whathe said until he began to talk as the devil would have it about theriches of mannering hall</s> meaning the large house on the right

nothing</s>  the long whitehouse with the pillars said he</s>  at the side of the blandford road</s> now i had looked at it as i passed and it had crossed my mind as suchthoughts will that it was a very easy house to get into with thatgreat row of grand windows and glass doors</s>  i had put the thought awayfrom me and now here was this landlord bringing it back with his talkabout the riches within</s>  i said nothing but i listened and as luckwould have it he would always come back to this one subject</s> he was a miser young so you can think what he is now in his age saidhe</s>  well hes had some good out of his money</s> what good can he have had if he does not spend it</s>  said i</s> well it bought him the prettiest wife in england and that was somegood that he got out of

silent creature moping about the country lanes</s>  somesay that she loved another man and that it was just the riches of theold lord which tempted her to be false to her lover and that now sheis eating her heart out because she has lost the one without being anynearer to the other for she might be the poorest woman in the parishfor all the money that she has the handling of</s> well sir you can imagine that it did not interest me very much to hearabout the quarrels between a lord and a lady</s>  what did it matter to meif she hated the sound of his voice or if he put every indignity uponher in the hope of breaking her spirit and spoke to her as he wouldnever have dared to speak to one of his servants</s>  the landlord told meof these things and of many more like them but they passed out of mymind for they were no concern of mine</s>  but what i did want to hear wasthe form in which lord mannering kept his riches</s>  titledeeds and stockcertificates are but paper and more danger than profit to the man whotakes them</s>  but metal and stones are worth a risk</s>  and then as if hewere answering my very thoughts the landlord told me of lordmannerings great collection of gold medals that it was the mostvaluable in the world and that it was reckoned that if they were putinto a sack the strongest man in the parish would not be able to raisethem</s>  then his wife called him and he and i went to our beds</s> i am not arguing to make out a case for myself but i beg you sir tobear all the facts in your mind and to ask yourself whether a man couldbe more sorely tempted

the long building with a full moon shining inevery window and silvering the high stone front</s>  i crouched there forsome time and i wondered where i should find the easiest entrance</s>  thecorner

temptation in a poor mans way when heputs his hand meaning no harm upon a door and finds it swing openbefore him</s>  in this case it was not so bad as that but the window wasmerely fastened with the

they were folding shutters and i shoved them before me and walkedinto the room</s> good evening sir</s>  you are very welcome</s>  said a voice</s> ive had some starts in my life but never one to come

ilooked at her ladyships face and i knew that i could trust her</s>  shewanted to revenge herself upon her husband</s>  she wanted to hit him whereit would hurt him mostupon the pocket</s>  she hated him so that she wouldeven lower her pride to take such a man as me into her confidence if shecould gain her end by doing so</s>  ive hated some folk in my time but idont think i ever understood what

had been brought from savage countriesand the lady took down a large leather sackbag from among them</s> this sleepingsack will do said she</s>  now come with me and i willshow you where the medals are</s> it was like a dream to me to think that this tall white woman was thelady of the house and that she was lending me a hand to rob her ownhome</s>  i could have burst out laughing at the thought of it and yetthere was something in that pale face of hers which stopped my laughterand turned me cold and serious</s>  she swept on in front of me like aspirit with the green taper in her hand and i walked behind with mysack until we came to a door at the end of this museum</s>  it was lockedbut the key was in it and she led me through</s> the room beyond was a small one hung all round with curtains which hadpictures on them</s>  it was the hunting of a deer that was painted on itas i remember and in the flicker of that light youd have sworn thatthe dogs and the horses were streaming round the walls</s>  the only otherthing in the room was a row of cases made of walnut with brassornaments</s>  they had glass tops and beneath this glass i saw the longlines of those gold medals some of them as big as a plate and half aninch thick all resting upon red velvet and glowing and gleaming in thedarkness</s>  my fingers were just itching to be at them and i slipped myknife under the lock

never said anythingabout murder</s>  the money lies under the bed</s>  but if you arefainthearted it is better that you should not attempt it</s> she worked upon me so partly with her scorn and partly with this moneythat she held before my eyes that i believe i should have yielded andtaken my chances upstairs had it not been that i saw her eyes followingthe struggle within me in such a crafty malignant fashion that it wasevident she was bent upon making me the tool of her revenge and thatshe would leave me no choice but to do the old man an injury or to becaptured by him</s>  she felt suddenly that she was giving herself away andshe changed her face to a kindly friendly smile but it was too latefor i had had my warning</s> i will not go upstairs said i</s>  i have all i want

whispered</s>  all right</s>  dont be alarmed</s>  illarrange it</s>  here</s>  quick behind the tapestry</s> she pushed me behind the painted curtains upon the wall my emptyleather bag still in my

light of a candle shone through the door of the museum and theshuffling steps came nearer</s>  then i saw a face in the doorway a greatheavy face all lines and creases with a huge curving nose and a pairof gold glasses fixed across it</s>  he had to throw his head back to seethrough the glasses and that great nose thrust out in front of him likethe beak of some sort of fowl</s>  he was a big man very tall and burly sothat in his loose dressinggown his figure seemed to fill up the wholedoorway</s>  he had a pile of grey curling hair all round his head but hisface was cleanshaven</s>  his mouth was thin and small and prim hiddenaway under his long masterful nose</s>  he stood there holding the candlein front of him and looking at his wife with a queer malicious gleamin his eyes</s>  it only

 i know your secret ambition but it shall never bewhile i live and if it happens after my death i will at least take carethat you go to him as a beggar</s>  you and dear edward will never have thesatisfaction of squandering my savings and you may make up your mind tothat my lady</s>  why are those shutters and the window open</s> i found the night very close</s> it is not safe</s>  how do you know that some tramp may not be outside</s>  areyou aware that my collection of medals is worth more than any similarcollection in the world</s>  you have left the door open also</s>  what is thereto prevent any one from rifling the cases</s> i was here</s> i know you were</s>  i heard you moving about in the medal room and thatwas why i came down</s>  what were you doing</s> looking at the medals</s>  what else should i be doing</s> this curiosity is something new</s>  he looked suspiciously at her andmoved on towards the inner room she walking beside him</s> it was at this moment that i saw something which startled</s>  i had laid myclaspknife open upon the top of one of the cases and there it lay infull view</s>  she saw it before he did and with a womans cunning she heldher taper out so that the light of it came between lord mannerings eyesand the knife</s>  then she took it with her left hand and held it againsther gown out of his sight</s>  he looked about from case to casei couldhave put my hand at one time upon his long nosebut there was nothingto show that the medals had been tampered with and so still snarlingand grumbling he shuffled off into the other room once more</s> and now i have to speak of what i heard rather than of what i saw but iswear to you as i shall stand some day before my maker that what i sayis the truth</s> when they passed into the outer room i saw him lay his candle upon thecorner of one of the tables and he sat himself down but in such aposition that he was just out of my sight</s>  she moved behind him as icould tell from the fact that the light of her taper threw his longlumpy shadow upon the floor in front of him</s>  then he began talking aboutthis man whom he called edward and every word that he said was like ablistering drop of vitriol</s>  he spoke low so that i could not hear itall but from what i heard i should guess that she would as soon havebeen lashed with a whip</s>  at first she said some hot words in reply butthen she was silent and he went on and on in that cold mocking voiceof his nagging and insulting and tormenting until i wondered that shecould bear to stand there in silence and listen to it</s>  then suddenly iheard him say in a sharp voice come from behind me</s>  leave go of mycollar</s>  what</s>  would you dare to strike me</s>  there was a sound like ablow just a soft sort of thud and then i heard him cry out my godits blood</s>  he shuffled with his feet as if he was getting up and theni heard another blow and he cried out oh you shedevil</s>  and wasquiet except for a dripping and splashing upon the floor</s> i ran out from behind my curtain at that and rushed into the otherroom shaking all over with the horror of it</s>  the old man had slippeddown in the chair and his dressinggown had rucked up until he lookedas if he had a monstrous hump to his back</s>  his head with the goldglasses still fixed on his nose was lolling over upon one side and hislittle mouth was open just like a dead fish</s>  i could not see where theblood was coming from but i could still hear it drumming upon thefloor</s>  she stood behind him with the candle shining full upon her face</s> her lips were pressed together and her eyes shining and a touch ofcolour had come into each of her cheeks</s>  it just wanted that to make herthe most beautiful woman i had ever seen in my life</s> youve done it now</s>  said i</s> yes said she in her quiet way ive done it now</s> what are you going to do</s>  i asked</s>  theyll have you for murder assure as fate</s> never

to get away</s>  i was never mixed up with abusiness like this before</s> nonsense</s>  said she</s>  you came for the medals and here they are atyour mercy</s>  why should you not have them</s>  there is no one to preventyou</s> i held the bag still in my hand</s>  she opened the case and between us wethrew a hundred or so of the medals into it</s>  they were all from the onecase but i could not bring myself to wait for any more</s>  then i made forthe window for the very air of this house seemed to poison me afterwhat i had seen and heard</s>  as i looked back i saw her standing theretall and graceful with the light in her hand just as i had seen herfirst</s>  she waved goodbye and i waved back at her and sprang out intothe gravel drive</s> i thank god that i can lay my hand upon my heart and say that i havenever done a murder but perhaps it would be different if i had beenable to read that womans mind and thoughts</s>  there might have been twobodies in the room instead

ivthe great keinplatz experimentof all the sciences which have puzzled the sons of men none had such anattraction for the learned professor von baumgarten as those whichrelate to psychology and the illdefined relations between mind andmatter</s>  a celebrated anatomist a profound chemist and one of the firstphysiologists in europe it was a relief for him to turn from thesesubjects and to bring his varied knowledge to bear upon the study of thesoul and the mysterious relationship of spirits</s>  at first when as ayoung man he began to dip into the secrets of mesmerism his mind seemedto be wandering in a strange land where all was chaos and darkness savethat here and there some great unexplainable and disconnected factloomed out in front of him</s>  as the years passed however and as theworthy professors stock of knowledge increased for knowledge begetsknowledge as money bears interest much which had seemed strange andunaccountable began to take another shape in his eyes</s>  new trains ofreasoning became familiar to him and he perceived connecting linkswhere all had been incomprehensible and startling</s>  by experiments whichextended over twenty years he obtained a basis of facts upon which itwas his ambition to build up a new exact science which should embracemesmerism spiritualism and all cognate subjects</s>  in this he was muchhelped by his intimate knowledge of the more intricate parts of animalphysiology which treat of nerve currents and the working of the brainfor alexis von baumgarten was regius professor of physiology at theuniversity of keinplatz and had all the resources of the laboratory toaid him in his profound researches</s> professor von baumgarten was tall and thin with a hatchet face andsteelgrey eyes which were singularly bright and penetrating</s>  muchthought had furrowed his forehead and contracted his heavy eyebrows sothat he appeared to wear a perpetual frown which often misled people asto his character for though austere he was tenderhearted</s>  he waspopular among the students who would gather round him after hislectures and listen eagerly to his strange theories</s>  often he would callfor volunteers from amongst them in order to conduct some experiment sothat eventually there was hardly a lad in the class who had not at onetime or another been thrown into a mesmeric trance by his professor</s> of all these young devotees of science there was none who equalled inenthusiasm fritz von hartmann</s>  it had often seemed strange to hisfellowstudents that wild reckless fritz as dashing a young fellow asever hailed from the rhinelands should devote the time and troublewhich he did in reading up abstruse works and in assisting the professorin his strange experiments</s>  the fact was however that fritz was aknowing and longheaded fellow</s>  months before he had lost his heart toyoung elise the blueeyed yellowhaired daughter of the lecturer</s> although he had succeeded in learning from her lips that she was notindifferent to his suit he had never dared to announce himself to herfamily as a formal suitor</s>  hence he would have found it a difficultmatter to see his young lady had he not adopted the expedient of makinghimself useful to the professor</s>  by this means he frequently was askedto the old mans house where he willingly submitted to be experimentedupon in any way as long as there was a chance of his receiving onebright glance from the eyes of elise or one touch of her little hand</s> young fritz von hartmann was a handsome lad enough</s>  there were broadacres too which would descend to him when his father died</s>  to many hewould have seemed an eligible suitor but madame frowned upon hispresence in the house and lectured the professor at times on hisallowing such a wolf to prowl around their lamb</s>  to tell the truthfritz had an evil name in keinplatz</s>  never was there a riot or a duelor any other mischief afoot but the young rhinelander figured as aringleader in it</s>  no one used more free and violent language no onedrank more no one played cards more habitually no one was more idlesave in the one solitary subject</s>  no wonder then that the good frauprofessorin gathered her frulein under her wing and resented theattentions of such a mauvais sujet</s>  as to the worthy lecturer he wastoo much engrossed by his strange studies to form an opinion upon thesubject one way or the other</s> for many years there was one question which had continually obtrudeditself upon his thoughts</s>  all his experiments and his theories turnedupon a single point</s>  a hundred times a day the professor asked himselfwhether it was possible for the human spirit to exist apart from thebody for a time and then to return to it once again</s>  when thepossibility first suggested itself to him his scientific mind hadrevolted from it</s>  it clashed too violently with preconceived ideas andthe prejudices of his early training</s>  gradually however as heproceeded farther and farther along the pathway of original researchhis mind shook off its old fetters and became ready to face anyconclusion which could reconcile the facts</s>  there were many things whichmade him believe that it was possible for mind to exist apart frommatter</s>  at last it occurred to him that by a daring and originalexperiment the question might be definitely decided</s> it is evident he remarked in his celebrated article upon invisibleentities which appeared in the keinplatz wochentliche medicalschriftabout this time and which surprised the whole scientific worldit isevident that under certain conditions the soul or mind does separateitself from the body</s>  in the case of a mesmerised person the body liesin a cataleptic condition but the spirit has left it</s>  perhaps you replythat the soul is there but in a dormant condition</s>  i answer that thisis not so otherwise how can one account for the condition ofclairvoyance which has fallen into disrepute through the knavery ofcertain scoundrels but which can easily be shown to be an undoubtedfact</s>  i have been able myself with a sensitive subject to obtain anaccurate description of what was going on in another room or anotherhouse</s>  how can such knowledge be accounted for on any hypothesis savethat the soul of the subject has left the body and is wandering throughspace</s>  for a moment it is recalled by the voice of the operator and sayswhat it has seen and then wings its way once more through the air</s> since the spirit is by its very nature invisible we cannot see thesecomings and goings but we see their effect in the body of the subjectnow rigid and inert now struggling to narrate impressions which couldnever have come to it by natural means</s>  there is only one way which ican see by which the fact can be demonstrated</s>  although we in the fleshare unable to see these spirits yet our own spirits could we separatethem from the body would be conscious of the presence of others</s>  it ismy intention therefore shortly to mesmerise one of my pupils</s>  i shallthen mesmerise myself in a manner which has become easy to me</s>  afterthat if my theory holds good my spirit will have no difficulty inmeeting and communing with the spirit of my pupil both being separatedfrom the body</s>  i hope to be able to communicate the result of thisinteresting experiment in an early number of the keinplatz wochenlichemedicalschrift</s> when the good professor finally fulfilled his promise and published anaccount of what occurred the narrative was so extraordinary that it wasreceived with general incredulity</s>  the tone of some of the papers was sooffensive in their comments upon the matter that the angry savantdeclared that he would never open his mouth again or refer to thesubject in any waya promise which he has faithfully kept</s>  thisnarrative has been compiled however from the most authentic sourcesand the events

caused considerable astonishment among theaudience and some were inclined to be offended thinking that heassumed rather too much importance</s>  the majority however looked uponhim as a young man of

that at the moment of this unexpected embrace vonhartmann was still leaning back against the end of the sofa which likemuch german furniture was in a somewhat rickety condition</s>  it alsochanced that beneath this end of the sofa there stood a tank full ofwater in which the physiologist was conducting certain experiments uponthe ova of fish and which he kept in his drawingroom in order toensure an equable temperature</s>  the additional weight of the maidencombined with the impetus with which she hurled herself upon him causedthe precarious piece of furniture to give way and the body of theunfortunate student was hurled backwards into the tank in which hishead and shoulders were firmly wedged while his lower extremitiesflapped helplessly about in the air</s>  this was the last straw</s> extricating himself with some difficulty from his unpleasant positionvon hartmann gave an inarticulate yell of fury and dashing out of theroom in spite of the entreaties of elise he seized his hat and rushedoff into the town all dripping and dishevelled with the intention ofseeking in some inn the food and comfort which he could not find athome</s> as the spirit of von baumgarten encased in the body of von hartmannstrode down the winding pathway which led down to the little townbrooding angrily over his many wrongs he became aware that an elderlyman was approaching him who appeared to be in an advanced state ofintoxication</s>  von hartmann waited by the side of the road and watchedthis individual who came stumbling along reeling from one side of theroad to the other and singing a student song in a very husky anddrunken voice</s>  at first his interest was merely excited by the fact ofseeing a man of so venerable an appearance in such a disgracefulcondition but as he approached nearer he became convinced that he knewthe other well though he could not recall when or where he had met him</s> this impression became so strong with him that when the stranger

overwhelmed by the many strange things which hadoccurred to him that day passed his hand over his forehead and cast hiseyes downwards he chanced to catch the reflection of his own face in apool which the rain had left upon the road</s>
 to his utter astonishment heperceived that his face was that of a youth that his dress was that ofa fashionable young student and that in every way he was the antithesisof the grave and scholarly

dragged hisown frame to the side of the road and threw it into a mesmeric trancehe then extracted the crystal ball from the pocket and managed to bringhimself into the same condition</s> some students and peasants who chanced to pass during the next hour weremuch astonished to see the worthy professor of physiology and hisfavourite student both sitting upon a very muddy bank and bothcompletely insensible</s>  before the hour was up quite a crowd hadassembled and they were discussing the advisability of sending for anambulance to convey the pair to hospital when the learned savantopened his

avoice of rapture gott sei gedanket</s>  i am myself again</s>  i feel i am</s> nor was the amazement lessened when the student springing to his feetburst into the same cry and the two performed a sort of pas de joiein the middle of the road</s> for some time after that people had some suspicion of the sanity of boththe actors in this strange episode</s>  when the professor published hisexperiences in the medicalschrift as he had promised he was met by anintimation even from his colleagues that he would do well to have hismind cared for and that another such publication would certainlyconsign him to a madhouse</s>  the student also found by experience that itwas wisest to be silent about the matter</s> when the worthy lecturer returned home that night he did not receive thecordial welcome which he might have looked for after his strangeadventures</s>  on the contrary he was roundly upbraided by both his femalerelatives for smelling of drink and tobacco and also for

when i put all my weighton my sidebrake and the lever clanged to its full limit without acatch it brought a cold sweat out of me</s>  by this time we were fairlytearing down the slope</s>  the lights were brilliant and i brought herround the first curve all right</s>  then we did the second one though itwas a close shave for the ditch</s>  there was a mile of straight then withthe third curve

down smith heard him stopand thought he caught the sound of whispering</s>  a moment later the doorbeneath him shut a key creaked in a lock and bellingham with beads ofmoisture upon his pale face

cameto forget to lock it</s> i didnt know you kept a dog said smith looking very thoughtfully atthe disturbed face of his companion</s> yes i havent had him long</s>  i must get rid of him</s>  hes a

excuse me i am sure</s> he picked up his cap and hurried from the room</s>  in spite of hisappointment smith heard him reenter his own chamber and lock his doorupon the inside</s> this interview left a disagreeable impression upon the medical studentsmind</s>  bellingham had lied to him and lied so clumsily that it looked asif he had desperate reasons for concealing the truth</s>  smith knew

expulsion to bellingham if it were discoveredby the authorities so that his anxiety and falsehoods might beaccounted for</s>  and yet it was inconceivable that an undergraduate couldkeep a woman in his rooms without being instantly detected</s>  be theexplanation what it might there was something ugly about it and smithdetermined as he turned to his books to discourage all furtherattempts at

the world he found it very hard to keephis mind upon his work</s>  it would slip away to brood upon the man beneathhim and upon the little mystery which hung round his chambers</s>  then histhoughts turned to this singular attack of which hastie had spoken andto the grudge which bellingham was said to owe the object of it</s>  the twoideas would persist in rising together in his mind as though

sister to be broken off</s>  smith thought of hastiescomparison of the toad and the dove and was glad to think that thematter was at an end</s>  bellinghams face when he was in a passion was notpleasant to look upon</s>  he was not a man to whom an innocent girl couldbe trusted for life</s>  as he walked smith wondered languidly what couldhave caused the quarrel and what the promise might

the isis</s>  a maysun was shining brightly and the yellow path was barred with the blackshadows of the tall elmtrees</s>  on either side the grey colleges layback from the road the hoary old mothers

yes it must seem very extraordinary and the worst of it is that icannot give my reasons for i am under a solemn promisea very solemnpromise</s>  but i may go so far as to say that i dont think

warning</s> if there is real reason for warning no promise can bind you</s>  if i seea rascal about to blow a place up with dynamite no pledge will stand inmy way of preventing him</s> ah but i cannot

i can only entreat you to change your rooms</s>  you arein danger where you are</s>  i dont even say that bellingham would wish toinjure you</s>  but it might happen for he is a dangerous neighbour

sprang from his chair in uncontrollable excitement</s> you know then</s>  he gasped</s> a woman</s> lee dropped back again with a groan</s> my lips are sealed he said</s>  i must not speak</s> well anyhow said smith rising it is not likely that i shouldallow myself to be frightened out of rooms which suit me very nicely</s>  itwould be a little too feeble for me to move out all my goods

ask you to excuseme</s> he bade the young student adieu in a few curt words and made his wayhomeward through the sweet spring evening feeling halfruffledhalfamused as any other strong unimaginative man might who has beenmenaced by a vague and shadowy danger</s> there was one little indulgence which abercrombie smith always allowedhimself however closely his work might press upon him</s>  twice a week onthe tuesday and the friday it was his invariable custom to walk over tofarlingford the residence of doctor plumptree peterson situated abouta mile and a half out of oxford</s>  peterson had been a close friend ofsmiths elder brother francis and as he was a bachelor fairlywelltodo with a good cellar and a better library his house was apleasant goal for a man who was in need of a brisk walk</s>  twice a weekthen the medical student would swing out there along the dark countryroads and spend a pleasant hour in petersons comfortable studydiscussing over a glass of old port the gossip of the varsity or thelatest developments of medicine or of surgery</s> on the day which followed his interview with monkhouse lee smith shutup his books at a quarter past eight the hour when he usually startedfor his friends house</s>  as he was leaving his room however his eyeschanced to fall upon one of the books which bellingham had lent him andhis conscience pricked him for not having returned it</s>  however repellentthe man might be he should not be treated with discourtesy</s>  taking thebook he walked downstairs and knocked at his neighbours door</s>  therewas no answer but on turning the handle he found that it was unlocked</s> pleased at the thought of avoiding an interview he stepped inside andplaced the book with his card upon the table</s> the lamp was turned half down

dried leaves</s>  the mummy case stood uprightagainst the wall but the mummy itself was missing</s>  there was no sign ofany second occupant of the room and he felt as he withdrew that he hadprobably done bellingham an injustice</s>  had he a guilty secret topreserve he would hardly leave his door open so that all the worldmight enter</s> the spiral stair was as black as pitch and smith was slowly making hisway down its irregular steps when he was suddenly conscious thatsomething had passed him in the darkness</s>  there was a faint sound awhiff of air a light brushing past his elbow but so slight that hecould scarcely be certain of it</s>  he stopped and listened but the windwas rustling among the ivy outside and he could hear nothing else</s> is that you styles</s>  he shouted</s> there was no answer and all was still behind him</s>  it must have been asudden gust of air for there were crannies and cracks in the oldturret</s>  and yet he could almost have sworn that he heard a footfall byhis very side</s>  he had emerged into the quadrangle still turning thematter over in his head when a man came running swiftly across thesmoothcropped lawn</s> is that you smith</s> hullo hastie</s> for gods sake come at once</s>  young lee is drowned</s>  heres harrington ofkings with the news</s>  the doctor is out</s>  youll do but come along atonce</s>  there may be life in him</s> have you brandy</s> no</s> ill bring some</s>  theres a flask on my table</s> smith bounded up the stairs taking three at a time seized the flaskand was rushing down with it when as he passed

shrivelled face towards the door</s>  the form waslifeless and inert but it seemed to smith as he gazed that there stilllingered a lurid spark of vitality some faint sign of consciousness inthe little eyes which lurked in the depths of the hollow sockets</s>  soastounded and shaken was he that he had forgotten his errand and wasstill staring at the lean sunken figure when the voice of his friendbelow recalled him to himself</s> come on smith</s>  he shouted</s>  its life and death you know</s>  hurry up</s> now then he added as the medical student reappeared let us do asprint</s>  it is well under a mile and we should do it in five minutes</s>  ahuman life is better worth running for than a pot</s> neck and neck they dashed through the darkness and did not pull upuntil panting and spent they had reached the little cottage by theriver</s>  young lee limp and dripping like a broken waterplant wasstretched upon the sofa the green scum of the river upon his blackhair and a fringe

hand to the ladsside</s>  put your watch glass to his lips</s>  yes theres dimming on it</s>  youtake one arm hastie</s>  now work it as i do and well soon pull himround</s> for ten minutes they worked in silence inflating and depressing thechest of the unconscious man</s>  at the end of that time a shiver ranthrough his body his lips trembled and he opened his eyes</s>  the threestudents burst out into an irrepressible cheer</s> wake up old chap</s>  youve frightened us quite enough</s> have some brandy</s>  take a sip from the flask</s> hes all right now said his companion

feather and hurled me in</s>  i heard nothing and i sawnothing</s>  but i know what it was for all that</s> and so do i whispered smith</s> lee looked up with a quick glance of surprise</s> youve learned then</s>  he said</s>  you remember the advice i gave you</s> yes and i begin to think that i shall take it</s> i dont know what the deuce you fellows are talking about saidhastie but i think

suddenlytaken form and stood out in his mind as a grim fact a thing not to bedenied</s>  and yet how monstrous it was</s>  how unheard of</s>  how entirelybeyond all bounds of human experience</s>  an impartial judge or even thefriend who walked by his side would simply tell him that his eyes haddeceived him that the mummy had been there all the time that young leehad tumbled into the river as any other man tumbles into a river andthat blue pill was the best thing for a disordered liver</s>  he felt thathe would have said as much if the positions had been reversed</s>  and yethe could swear that bellingham was a murderer at heart and that hewielded a weapon such as no man had ever used in all the grim history ofcrime</s> hastie had branched off to his rooms with a few crisp and emphaticcomments upon his friends unsociability and abercrombie smith crossedthe quadrangle to his corner turret with a strong feeling of repulsionfor his chambers and their associations</s>  he would take lees adviceand move his quarters as soon as possible for how could a man studywhen his ear was ever straining for every murmur or footstep in the roombelow</s>  he observed as he crossed over the lawn that the light wasstill shining in bellinghams window and as he passed up the staircasethe door opened and the man himself looked out at him</s>  with his fatevil face he was like some bloated

was sorry tohear that there was a rumour that something was amiss with him</s> his features were grave but there was the gleam of a hidden laugh inhis eyes as he spoke</s>  smith saw it and he could

neednt try to brazen it out</s>  i know allabout it</s> bellingham took a step back from the angry student and halfclosed thedoor as if to protect himself</s> you are mad he said</s>  what do you mean</s>  do you assert that i hadanything to do with lees accident</s> yes thundered smith</s>  you and that bag of bones behind you youworked it between you</s>  i tell you what it is master b</s>  they have givenup burning folk like you but we still keep a hangman and by george</s> if any man in this college meets his death while you are here ill haveyou up and if you dont swing for it it wont be my fault</s>  youllfind that your filthy egyptian tricks wont answer in england</s> youre a raving lunatic said bellingham</s> all right</s>  you just remember what i say for youll find that ill bebetter than my word</s> the door slammed and smith went fuming up to his chamber where helocked the door upon the inside and spent half the night in smoking hisold briar and brooding over the strange events of the evening</s> next morning abercrombie smith heard nothing of his neighbour butharrington called upon him in the afternoon to say that lee was almosthimself again</s>  all day

welcome to his jangled nerves</s> bellinghams door was shut as he passed but glancing back when he wassome distance from the turret he saw his neighbours head at the windowoutlined against the lamplight his face pressed apparently against theglass as he gazed out into the darkness</s>  it was a blessing to be awayfrom all contact with him if but for a few hours and smith stepped outbriskly

abrisk breeze and light fleecy clouds drifted swiftly across the sky</s> olds was on the very border of the town and in five minutes smithfound himself beyond the houses and between the hedges of a mayscentedoxfordshire lane</s> it was a lonely and little frequented road which led to his friendshouse</s>  early as it was smith did not meet a single soul upon his way</s> he walked briskly along until he came to the avenue gate which openedinto the long gravel drive leading up to farlingford</s>  in front of him hecould see the cosy red light of the windows glimmering through thefoliage</s>  he stood with his hand upon the iron latch of the swinginggate and he glanced back at the road along which he had come</s>  somethingwas coming swiftly down it</s> it moved in the shadow of the hedge

out of the darkness he had a glimpse of a scraggyneck and of two eyes that will ever haunt him in his dreams</s>  he turnedand with a cry of terror he ran for his life up the avenue</s>  there werethe red lights the signals of safety almost within a stonesthrow ofhim</s>  he was a famous runner but never had he run as he ran that night</s> the heavy gate had swung into place behind him but he heard

nearer yet sounded the clatter from behind</s>  heheard a hoarse gurgling at his very shoulder</s>  with a shriek he flunghimself against the door slammed and bolted it behind him and sankhalffainting on to the hall chair</s> my goodness smith whats the matter</s>  asked peterson appearing atthe door of his study</s> give me some brandy</s> peterson disappeared and came rushing out again with a glass and adecanter</s> you need it he said as his visitor drank off what he poured out forhim</s>  why man you are as white as a cheese</s> smith laid down his glass rose up and took a deep

under the cheery lamplight with a glass of wine on thetable beside him and the portly form and florid face of his friend infront he narrated in their order all the events great and smallwhich had

creature moving had shaken his nerve even though he hadexpected it</s>  you remember that almost the first words he said were tocall out upon himself as a fool</s>  well he got more hardened afterwardsand carried the matter through without fainting</s>  the vitality which hecould put into it was evidently only a passing thing for i have seen itcontinually in its case as dead as this table</s>  he has some elaborateprocess i fancy by which he brings the thing to pass</s>  having done ithe naturally bethought him that he might use the creature as an agent</s> it has intelligence and it has strength</s>  for some purpose he took leeinto his confidence but lee like a decent christian would havenothing to do with such a business</s>  then they had a row and lee vowedthat he would tell his sister of bellinghams true character</s> bellinghams game was to prevent him and he nearly managed it bysetting this creature of his on his track</s>  he had already tried itspowers

out of the question</s> and then lee may have fallen into the river and norton been garrotted</s> it is certainly a formidable indictment that you have againstbellingham but if you were to place it

my studies</s> and such is the narrative of abercrombie smith as to the singular eventswhich occurred in old college oxford in the spring of 84</s>  asbellingham left the university immediately

dark things which may be foundby those who seek for them</s> xide profundisso long as the oceans are the ligaments which bind together the greatbroadcast british empire so long will there be a dash of romance in ourminds</s>  for the soul is swayed by the waters as the waters are by themoon and when the great highways of an empire are along such roads asthese so full of strange sights and sounds with danger ever runninglike a hedge on either side of the course it is a dull mind indeedwhich does not bear away with it some trace of such a passage</s>  and nowbritain lies far beyond herself for the threemile limit of everyseaboard is her frontier which has been won by hammer and loom and pickrather than by arts of war</s>  for it is written in history that neitherking nor army can bar the path to the man who having twopence in hisstrong box and knowing well where he can turn it to threepence setshis mind to that one end</s>  and as the frontier has broadened the mind ofbritain has broadened too spreading out until all men can see that theways of the island are continental even as those of the continent areinsular</s> but for this a price must be paid and the price is a grievous one</s>  asthe beast of old must have one young human life as a tribute every yearso to our empire we throw from day to day the pick and flower of ouryouth</s>  the engine is worldwide and strong but the only fuel that willdrive it is the lives of british men</s>  thus it is that in the grey oldcathedrals as we look round upon the brasses on the walls we seestrange names such names as they who reared those walls had neverheard for it is in peshawur and umballah and korti and fort pearsonthat the youngsters die leaving only a precedent and a brass behindthem</s>  but if every man had his obelisk even where he lay then nofrontier line need be drawn for a cordon of british graves would evershow how high the angloceltic tide had lapped</s> this then as well as the waters which join us to the world has donesomething to tinge us with romance</s>  for when so many have their lovedones over the seas walking amid hillmens bullets or swamp malariawhere death is sudden and distance great then mind communes with mindand strange stories arise of dream presentiment or vision where themother sees her dying son and is past the first bitterness of her griefere the message comes which should have broken the news</s>  the learnedhave of late looked into the matter and have even labelled it with aname but what can we know more of it save that a poor stricken soulwhen hardpressed and driven can shoot across the earth sometenthousandmiledistant picture of its trouble to the mind which ismost akin to it</s>  far be it from me to say that there lies no such powerwithin us for of all things which the brain will grasp the last will beitself but yet it is well to be very cautious over such matters foronce at least i have known that which was within the laws of nature seemto be far upon the further side of them</s> john vansittart was the younger partner of the firm of hudson andvansittart coffee exporters of the island of ceylon threequartersdutchman by descent but wholly english in his sympathies</s>  for years ihad been his agent in london and when in 72 he came over to englandfor a three months holiday he turned to me for the introductions whichwould enable him to see something of town and country life</s>  armed withseven letters he left my offices and for many weeks scrappy notes fromdifferent parts of the country let me know that he had found favour inthe eyes of my friends</s>  then came word of his engagement to emilylawson of a cadet branch of the hereford lawsons and at the very tailof the first flying rumour the news of his absolute marriage for thewooing of

thousandtonbarquerigged sailing ships and this was to be their princelyhoneymoon at once a necessity and a delight</s> those were the royal days of coffeeplanting in ceylon before a singleseason and a rotting fungus drove a whole community through years ofdespair to one of the greatest commercial victories which pluck andingenuity ever won</s>  not often is it that men have the heart when theirone great industry is withered to rear up in a few years another as richto take its place and the teafields of ceylon are as true a monumentto courage as is the lion at waterloo</s>  but in 72 there was no cloud yetabove the skyline and the hopes of the planters were as high and asbright as the hillsides on which they reared their crops</s>  vansittartcame down to london with his young and beautiful

saidnothing but that face of hers was one long wail of fear</s> on the fifth day i took counsel with an old seaman</s> i should have preferred to have done so alone but she saw me speak withhim and

foot of way</s> at ten oclock that night emily vansittart and i stood leaning on thestarboard railing of the poop with a full moon shining at our backsand casting a black shadow of the barque and of our own two heads uponthe shining water</s>  from the shadow a broadening path of moonshinestretched away to the lonely skyline flickering and shimmering in thegentle heave of the swell</s>  we were talking with bent heads chatting ofthe calm of the chances of wind of the look of the sky when therecame a sudden plop like a rising salmon and there in the clear lightjohn vansittart sprang out of the water and looked up at us</s> i never saw anything clearer in my life than i saw that man</s>  the moonshone full upon him and he was but three oars length away</s>  his facewas more puffed than when i had seen him last mottled here and therewith dark scabs his mouth and eyes open as one who is struck with someoverpowering surprise</s>  he had some white stuff streaming from hisshoulders and one hand was raised to his ear the other crooked acrosshis breast</s>  i saw him leap from the water into the air and in the deadcalm the waves of his coming lapped up against the sides of the vessel</s> then his figure sank back into the water again and i heard a rendingcrackling sound like a bundle of brushwood snapping in the fire on afrosty night</s>  there were no signs of him when i looked again but aswift swirl and eddy on the still sea still marked the spot where he hadbeen</s>  how long i stood there tingling to my fingertips holding up anunconscious woman with one hand clutching at the rail of the vesselwith the other was more than i could afterwards tell</s>  i had been notedas a man of slow and unresponsive emotions but this time at least i wasshaken to the core</s>  once and twice i struck my foot upon the deck to becertain that i was indeed the master of my own senses and that this wasnot some mad prank of an unruly brain</s>  as i stood still marvelling thewoman shivered opened her eyes gasped and then standing erect withher hands upon the rail looked out over the moonlit sea with a facewhich had aged ten years in a summer night</s> you saw his vision</s>  she murmured</s> i saw something</s> it was he</s>  it was john</s>  he is dead</s> i muttered some lame words of doubt</s> doubtless he died at this hour she whispered</s>  in

dropped anchor at sundown in the bay offunchal</s>  the eastern star lay no great distance from us with thequarantine flag flying from her main and her jack halfway up her peak</s> you see said mrs</s>  vansittart quickly</s>  she was dryeyed now for shehad known how it would be</s> that night we received permission from the authorities to move on boardthe eastern star</s>  the captain hines was waiting upon deck withconfusion and grief contending upon his bluff face as he sought forwords with which to break this heavy tidings but she took the storyfrom his lips</s> i know that my husband

limbsand every appearance of giant strength</s>  his face was a remarkable onenoble and yet sinister with dark eyes and hair a prominent hookednose and a beard which flowed over his chest</s>  he steadied himself withone knotted hand while the other held a steel hammer dangling by hisknee</s> its all ready aloft said he</s>  ill go up with you if i may</s>  hesprang down from his perch and

screw that is riot in mykeeping</s>  heres my hammer to ring them true and my spanner to wrenchthem tight</s>  as the lord over the earth so am ieven iover thetower with power of life and power of death aye of death and of life</s> the hydraulic machinery had begun to work and the lift very slowlyascended</s>  as it mounted the glorious panorama of the coast and baygradually unfolded itself</s>  so engrossing was the view that thepassengers hardly noticed it when the platform stopped abruptly betweenstages at the five hundred foot level</s>  barnes the workman mutteredthat something must be amiss and springing like a cat across the gapwhich separated them from the trelliswork of metal he clambered out ofsight</s>  the motley little party suspended in midair lost something oftheir british shyness under such unwonted conditions and began tocompare notes with each other</s>  one couple who addressed each other asdolly and billy announced to the company that they were the particularstars of the hippodrome bill and kept their neighbours tittering withtheir rather obvious wit</s>  a buxom mother her precocious son and twomarried couples upon holiday formed an appreciative audience</s>

ashout all together</s> it was a fine effort but there was no response</s>  it was clear that themanagement down below was quite ignorant or impotent</s>  no sound came backto them</s> the passengers became alarmed</s>  the commercial traveller was rather lessrubicund</s>  billy still tried to joke but his efforts were not wellreceived</s>  the officer in his blue uniform at once took his place asrightful leader in a crisis</s>  they all looked to him and appealed to him</s> what would you advise sir</s>  you dont think theres any danger of itcoming down do you</s> not the least</s>  but its awkward to be stuck here all the same</s>  i thinki could jump across on to that girder</s>  then perhaps i could see what iswrong</s> no no tom for goodness sake dont leave us</s> some people have a

very well for old isaiah</s>  its his job and i wouldnt do himout of it</s> three sides of the lift were shut in with wooden partitions piercedwith windows for the view</s>  the fourth side facing the sea was clear</s> stangate leaned as far as he could and looked upwards</s>  as he did sothere came from above him a peculiar sonorous metallic twang as if amighty harpstring had been struck</s>  some distance upa hundred feetperhapshe could see a long brown corded arm which was workingfuriously among the wire cordage above</s>  the form was beyond his viewbut he was fascinated by this bare sinewy arm which tugged and pulledand sagged and stabbed</s> its all right he said and a general sigh of relief broke from hisstrange comrades at his words</s>  there is some one above us settingthings right</s> its old isaiah said billy stretching his neck round the corner</s>  icant see him but its his arm for a dollar</s>  whats he got in hishand</s>  looks like a screwdriver or something</s>  no

when itparted strand by strand at dixmude</s>  what the deuce is the fellowabout</s>  hey there</s>  what are you trying to do</s> the man had ceased his work and was now slowly descending the irontrellis</s> all right hes coming said stangate to his startled companions</s> its all right mary</s>  dont be frightened any of you</s>  its absurd tosuppose he would really weaken the cord that holds us</s> a pair of high boots appeared from above</s>  then came the leathernbreeches the belt with its dangling tools the muscular form andfinally the fierce swarthy eagle face of the workman</s>  his coat wasoff and his shirt open showing the hairy chest</s>  as he appeared therecame another sharp snapping vibration from above</s>  the man made his waydown in leisurely fashion and then balancing himself upon thecrossgirder and leaning against the side piece he stood with foldedarms looking from under his heavy black brows at the huddled passengersupon the platform</s> hallo</s>  said stangate</s>  whats the matter</s> the man stood impassive and silent with something indescribablymenacing in his fixed unwinking stare</s> the flying officer grew angry</s> hallo</s>  are you deaf</s>  he cried</s>  how long do you mean to have us stuckhere</s> the man stood silent</s>  there was something devilish in his appearance</s> ill complain of you my lad said billy in a quivering

what</s>  weve had about enough of it i tell you</s> mary maclean had gripped her lover by the arm in agony of sudden panic</s> oh tom</s>  she cried</s>  look at his eyeslook at his horrible eyes</s>  theman is a maniac</s> the workman stirred suddenly into sinister life</s>  his dark face brokeinto writhing lines of passion and his fierce eyes glowed like emberswhile he shook one long arm in the air</s> behold he cried those who are mad to the children of this world arein very truth the lords anointed and the dwellers in the inner temple</s> lo i am one who is prepared to testify even to the uttermost for of averity the day has now come when the humble will be exalted and thewicked will be cut off in their sins</s> mother</s>  mother</s>  cried the little boy in terror</s> there there</s>  its all right jack said the buxom woman and then ina burst of womanly wrath what dyou want to make the child cry for</s> youre a pretty man you are</s> better he should cry now than in the outer darkness</s>  let him seeksafety while there is yet time</s> the officer measured the gap with a practised eye</s>  it was a good eightfeet across and the fellow could push him over before he could

shin up and get that wedge out and we will agree tosay no more about it</s> another rending snap came from above</s> by george the hawser is going</s>  cried stangate</s>  here</s>  stand aside</s> im

that goes there is more strain upon the rest</s> five minutes of time and all eternity beyond</s> a moan of fear rose from the prisoners in the lift</s>  stangate felt a coldsweat upon his brow as he passed his arm round the shrinking girl</s>  ifthis vindictive devil could only be coaxed away for an instant he wouldspring across and take his chance in a handtohand fight</s> look here my

ground</s> for a moment there may have been some softening in the mans fierce eyesas he looked at the sweet face which was upturned to him</s>  then hisfeatures set once more into their grim lines of malice</s> my hand is set to the work woman</s>  it is not for the servant to lookback from his task</s> but why should this be your task</s> because there is a voice within me which tells me so</s>  in the nighttimei have heard it and in the daytime too when i have lain out alone uponthe girders and seen the wicked dotting the streets beneath me eachbusy on his own evil intent</s>  john barnes john barnes said the voice</s> you are here that you may give a sign to a sinful generationsuch asign as shall show them that the lord liveth and that there is ajudgment upon sin</s>  who am i that i
