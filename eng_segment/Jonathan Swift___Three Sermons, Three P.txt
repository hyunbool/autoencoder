three sermons and prayers by jonathan swiftcontents on mutual subjection on sleeping in church on the wisdom of this world prayers used by the dean for stellaon mutual subjection 1first printed in 1744yea all of you be subject one to another</s> i peter v</s>  5the apostle having in many parts of this epistle given directionsto christians concerning the duty of subjection or obedience tosuperiors in the several instances of the subject to the princethe child to his parent the servant to his master the wife to herhusband and the younger to the elder doth here in the words of mytext sum up the whole by advancing a point of doctrine which atfirst may appear a little extraordinary</s>  yea all of you saithhe be subject one to another</s>  for it should seem that twopersons cannot properly be said to be subject to each other andthat subjection is only due from inferiors to those above them yetst</s>  paul hath several passages to the same purpose</s>  for he exhortsthe romans in honour to prefer one another and the philippiansthat in lowliness of mind they should each esteem other better thanthemselves and the ephesians that they should submit themselvesone to another in the fear of the lord</s>  here we find these twogreat apostles recommending to all christians this duty of mutualsubjection</s>  for we may observe by st</s>  peter that having mentionedthe several relations which men bear to each other as governor andsubject master and servant and the rest which i have alreadyrepeated he makes no exception but sums up the whole withcommanding all to be subject one to another</s>  whence we mayconclude that this subjection due from all men to all men issomething more than the compliment of course when our betters arepleased to tell us they are our humble servants but understand usto be their slaves</s> i know very well that some of those who explain this text apply itto humility to the duties of charity to private exhortations andto bearing with each others infirmities and it is probable theapostle may have had a regard to all these</s>  but however manylearned men agree that there is something more understood and sothe words in their plain natural meaning must import as you willobserve yourselves if you read them with the beginning of the versewhich is thus likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto theelder yea all of you be subject one to another</s>  so that uponthe whole there must be some kind of subjection due from every manto every man which cannot be made void by any power preeminenceor authority whatsoever</s>  now what sort of subjection this is andhow it ought to be paid shall be the subject of my presentdiscourse</s> as god hath contrived all the works of nature to be useful and insome manner a support to each other by which the whole frame of theworld under his providence is preserved and kept up so amongmankind our particular stations are appointed to each of us by godalmighty wherein we are obliged to act as far as our power reachethtoward the good of the whole community</s>  and he who doth not performthat part assigned him towards advancing the benefit of the wholein proportion to his opportunities and abilities is not only auseless but a very mischievous member of the public because hetakes his share of the profit and yet leaves his share of theburden to be borne by others which is the true principal cause ofmost miseries and misfortunes in life</s>  for a wise man who does notassist with his counsels a great man with his protection a richman with his bounty and charity and a poor man with his labour areperfect nuisances in a commonwealth</s>  neither is any condition oflife more honourable in the sight of god than another otherwise hewould be a respecter of persons which he assures us he is not forhe hath proposed the same salvation to all men and hath only placedthem in different ways or stations to work it out</s>  princes are bornwith no more advantages of strength or wisdom than other men andby an unhappy education are usually more defective in both thanthousands of their subjects</s>  they depend for every necessary oflife upon the meanest of their people besides obedience andsubjection were never enjoined by god to humour the passions lustsand vanities of those who demand them from us but we are commandedto obey our governors because disobedience would breed seditions inthe state</s>  thus servants are directed to obey their masterschildren their parents and wives their husbands not from anyrespect of persons in god but because otherwise there would benothing but confusion in private families</s>  this matter will beclearly explained by considering the comparison which st</s>  paul makesbetween the church of christ and the body of man for the sameresemblance will hold not only to families and kingdoms but to thewhole corporation of mankind</s>  the eye saith he cannot say untothe hand i have no need of thee nor again the hand to the footi have no need of thee</s>  nay much more those members of the bodywhich seem to be more feeble are necessary and whether one membersuffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honouredall the members rejoice with it</s>  the case is directly the sameamong mankind</s>  the prince cannot say to the merchant i have noneed of thee nor the merchant to the labourer i have no need ofthee</s>  nay much more those members which seem to be more feebleare necessary for the poor are generally more necessary members ofthe commonwealth than the rich which clearly shows that god neverintended such possessions for the sake and service of those to whomhe lends them but because he hath assigned every man his particularstation to be useful in life and this for the reason given by theapostle that there may be no schism in the body</s> from hence may partly be gathered the nature of that subjectionwhich we all owe to one another</s>  god almighty hath been pleased toput us into an imperfect state where we have perpetual occasion ofeach others assistance</s>
it plainly appears from what hath been said that no one humancreature is more worthy than another in the sight of god furtherthan according to the goodness or holiness of their lives and thatpower wealth and the like outward advantages are so far frombeing the marks of gods approving or preferring those on whom theyare bestowed that on the contrary he is pleased to suffer them tobe almost engrossed by those who have least title to his favour</s> now according to this equality wherein god hath placed all mankindwith relation to himself you will observe that in all the relationsbetween man and man there is a mutual dependence whereby the onecannot subsist without the other</s>  thus no man can be a princewithout subjects nor a master without servants nor a fatherwithout children</s>  and this both explains and confirms the doctrineof the text for where there is a mutual dependence there must be amutual duty and consequently a mutual subjection</s>  for instancethe subject must obey his prince because god commands it humanlaws require it and the safety of the public makes it necessaryfor the same reasons we must obey all that are in authority andsubmit ourselves not only to the good and gentle but also to thefroward whether they rule according to our liking or not</s>  on theother side in those countries that pretend to freedom princes aresubject to those laws which their people have chosen they are boundto protect their subjects in liberty property and religion toreceive their petitions and redress their grievances so that thebest prince is in the opinion of wise men only the greatestservant of the nationnot only a servant to the public in generalbut in some sort to every man in it</s>  in the like manner a servantowes obedience and diligence and faithfulness to his master fromwhom at the same time he hath a just demand for protection andmaintenance and gentle treatment</s>  nay even the poor beggar hath ajust demand of an alms from the rich man who is guilty of fraudinjustice and oppression if he does not afford relief according tohis abilities</s> but this subjection we all owe one another is nowhere more necessarythan in the common conversations of life for without it there couldbe no society among men</s>  if the learned would not sometimes submitto the ignorant the wise to the simple the gentle to the frowardthe old to the weaknesses of the young there would be nothing buteverlasting variance in the world</s>  this our saviour himselfconfirmed by his own example for he appeared in the form of aservant and washed his disciples feet adding those memorablewords ye call me lord and master and ye say well for so i am</s> if i then your lord and master wash your feet how much more oughtye to wash one anothers feet</s>  under which expression of washingthe feet is included all that subjection assistance love andduty which every good christian ought to pay his brother inwhatever station god hath placed him</s>  for the greatest prince andthe meanest slave are not by infinite degrees so distant as oursaviour and those disciples whose feet he vouchsafed to wash</s> and although this doctrine of subjecting ourselves to one anothermay seem to grate upon the pride and vanity of mankind and maytherefore be hard to be digested by those who value themselves upontheir greatness or their wealth yet it is really no more than whatmost men practise upon other occasions</s>  for if our neighbour whois our inferior comes to see us we rise to receive him we placehim above us and respect him as if he were better than ourselvesand this is thought both decent and necessary and is usually calledgood manners</s>  now the duty required by the apostle is only that weshould enlarge our minds and that what we thus practise in thecommon course of life we should imitate in all our actions andproceedings whatsoever since our saviour tells us that every man isour neighbour and since we are so ready in point of civility toyield to others in our own houses where only we have any title togovern</s> having thus shown you what sort of subjection it is which all menowe one another and in what manner it ought to be paid i shall nowdraw some observations from what hath been said</s> and first a thorough practice of this duty of subjecting ourselvesto the wants and infirmities of each other would utterly extinguishin us the vice of pride</s> for if god has pleased to intrust me with a talent not for my ownsake but for the service of others and at the same time hath leftme full of wants and necessities which others must supply i canthen have no cause to set any extraordinary value upon myself or todespise my brother because he hath not the same talents which werelent to me</s>  his being may probably be as useful to the public asmine and therefore by the rules of right reason i am in no sortpreferable to him</s> secondly it is very manifest from what has been said that no manought to look upon the advantages of life such as riches honourpower and the like as his property but merely as a trust whichgod hath deposited with him to be employed for the use of hisbrethren and god will certainly punish the breach of that trustthough the laws of man will not or rather indeed cannot becausethe trust was conferred only by god who has not left it to anypower on earth to decide infallibly whether a man makes a good useof his talents or not or to punish him where he fails</s>  andtherefore god seems to have more particularly taken this matter intohis own hands and will most certainly reward or punish us inproportion to our good or ill performance in it</s>  now although theadvantages which one possesseth more than another may in somesense be called his property with respect to other men yet withrespect to god they are as i said only a trust which will plainlyappear from hence if a man does not use those advantages to thegood of the public or the benefit of his neighbour it is certain hedoth not deserve them and consequently that god never intended themfor a blessing to him and on the other side whoever does employhis talents as he ought will find by his own experience that theywere chiefly lent him for the service of others for to the serviceof others he will certainly employ them</s> thirdly if we could all be brought to practise this duty ofsubjecting ourselves to each other it would very much contribute tothe general happiness of mankind for this would root out envy andmalice from the heart of man because you cannot envy yourneighbours strength if he make use of it to defend your life orcarry your burden you cannot envy his wisdom if he gives you goodcounsel nor his riches if he supplies your wants nor his greatnessif he employs it to your protection</s>  the miseries of life are notproperly owing to the unequal distribution of things but godalmighty the great king of heaven is treated like the kings of theearth who although perhaps intending well themselves have oftenmost abominable ministers and stewards and those generally thevilest to whom they intrust the most talents</s>  but here is thedifference that the princes of this world see by other mens eyesbut god sees all things and therefore whenever he permits hisblessings to be dealt among those who are unworthy we may certainlyconclude that he intends them only as a punishment to an evil worldas well as to the owners</s>  it were well if those would considerthis whose riches serve them only as a spur to avarice or as aninstrument of their lusts whose wisdom is only of this world toput false colours upon things to call good evil and evil goodagainst the conviction of their own consciences and lastly whoemploy their power and favour in acts of oppression or injustice inmisrepresenting persons and things or in countenancing the wickedto the ruin of the innocent</s> fourthly the practice of this duty of being subject to one anotherwould make us rest contented in the several stations of life whereingod hath thought fit to place us because it would in the best andeasiest manner bring us back as it were to that early state ofthe gospel when christians had all things in common</s>  for if thepoor found the rich disposed to supply their want if the ignorantfound the wise ready to instruct and direct them or if the weakmight always find protection from the mighty they could none ofthem with the least pretence of justice lament their owncondition</s> from all that hath been hitherto said it appears that greatabilities of any sort when they are employed as god directs do butmake the owners of them greater and more painful servants to theirneighbour and the public</s>
 what is there that can give a generous spirit morepleasure and complacency of mind than to consider that he is aninstrument of doing much good that great numbers owe to him undergod their subsistence their safety their health and the goodconduct of their lives</s>  the wickedest man upon earth takes apleasure in doing good to those he loves and therefore surely agood christian who obeys our saviours commands of loving all mencannot but take delight in doing good even to his enemies</s>  god whogives all things to all men can receive nothing from any and thoseamong men who do the most good and receive the fewest returns domost resemble the creator for which reason st</s>  paul delivers it asa saying of our saviour that it is more blessed to give thanreceive</s>  by this rule what must become of those things which theworld values as the greatest blessingsriches power and the likewhen our saviour plainly determines that the best way to make themblessings is to part with them</s>  therefore although the advantageswhich one man hath over another may be called blessings yet theyare by no means so in the sense the world usually understands</s>
thus for example great riches are no blessings in themselvesbecause the poor man with the common necessaries of life enjoysmore health and has fewer cares without them</s>  how then do theybecome blessings</s>  no otherwise than by being employed in feedingthe hungry clothing the naked rewarding worthy men and in shortdoing acts of charity and generosity</s>  thus likewise power is noblessing in itself because private men bear less envy and troubleand anguish without it</s>  but when it is employed to protect theinnocent to relieve the oppressed and to punish the oppressorthen it becomes a great blessing</s> and so lastly even great wisdom is in the opinion of solomon nota blessing in itself for in much wisdom is much sorrow and menof common understanding if they serve god and mind their callingsmake fewer mistakes in the conduct of life than those who havebetter heads</s>  and yet wisdom is a mighty blessing when it isapplied to good purposes to instruct the ignorant to be a faithfulcounsellor either in public or private to be a director to youthand to many other ends needless here to mention</s> to conclude god sent us into the world to obey his commands bydoing as much good as our abilities will reach and as little evilas our many infirmities will permit</s>  some he hath only trusted withone talent some with five and some with ten</s>  no man is withouthis talent and he that is faithful or negligent in a little shallbe rewarded or punished as well as he that hath been so in a greatdeal</s> consider what hath been said c</s> on sleeping in churchand there sat in the window a certain young man named eutychusbeing fallen into a deep sleep and while paul was long preachinghe sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and wastaken up dead</s> acts xx</s>  9</s> i have chosen these words with design if possible to disturb somepart in this audience of half an hours sleep for the convenienceand exercise whereof this place at this season of the day is verymuch celebrated</s> there is indeed one mortal disadvantage to which all preaching issubject that those who by the wickedness of their lives stand ingreatest need have usually the smallest share for either they areabsent upon the account of idleness or spleen or hatred toreligion or in order to doze away the intemperance of the week orif they do come they are sure to employ their minds rather anyother way than regarding or attending to the business of the place</s> the accident which happened to this young man in the text hath notbeen sufficient to discourage his successors but because thepreachers now in the world however they may exceed st</s>  paul in theart of setting men to sleep do extremely fall short of him in theworking of miracles therefore men are become so cautious as tochoose more safe and convenient stations and postures for takingtheir repose without hazard of their persons and upon the wholematter choose rather to trust their destruction to a miracle thantheir safety</s>  however this being not the only way by which thelukewarm christians and scorners of the age discover their neglectand contempt of preaching i shall enter expressly intoconsideration of this matter and order my discourse in thefollowing methodfirst i shall produce several instances to show the great neglectof preaching now among us</s> secondly i shall reckon up some of the usual quarrels men haveagainst preaching</s> thirdly i shall get forth the great evil of this neglect andcontempt of preaching and discover the real causes whence itproceedeth</s> lastly i shall offer some remedies against this great and spreadingevil</s> first i shall produce certain instances to show the great neglectof preaching now among us</s> these may be reduced under two heads</s>
 first mens absence from theservice of the church and secondly their misbehaviour when theyare here</s> the first instance of mens neglect is in their frequent absencefrom the church</s>
there is no excuse so trivial that will not pass upon some mensconsciences to excuse their attendance at the public worship of god</s> some are so unfortunate as to be always indisposed on the lordsday and think nothing so unwholesome as the air of a church</s> others have their affairs so oddly contrived as to be alwaysunluckily prevented by business</s>  with some it is a great mark ofwit and deep understanding to stay at home on sundays</s>  others againdiscover strange fits of laziness that seize them particularly onthat day and confine them to their beds</s>  others are absent out ofmere contempt of religion</s>  and lastly there are not a few who lookupon it as a day of rest and therefore claim the privilege of theircattle to keep the sabbath by eating drinking and sleeping afterthe toil and labour of the week</s>  now in all this the worstcircumstance is that these persons are such whose company is mostrequired and who stand most in need of a physician</s> secondly mens great neglect and contempt of preaching appear bytheir misbehaviour when at church</s> if the audience were to be ranked under several heads according totheir behaviour when the word of god is delivered how small anumber would appear of those who receive it as they ought</s>  how muchof the seed then sown would be found to fall by the wayside uponstony ground or among thorns</s>  and how little good ground wouldthere be to take it</s>  a preacher cannot look round from the pulpitwithout observing that some are in a perpetual whisper and by theirair and gesture give occasion to suspect that they are in those veryminutes defaming their neighbour</s>  others have their eyes andimagination constantly engaged in such a circle of objects perhapsto gratify the most unwarrantable desires that they never onceattend to the business of the place the sound of the preacherswords do not so much as once interrupt them</s>  some have their mindswandering among idle worldly or vicious thoughts some lie atcatch to ridicule whatever they hear and with much wit and humourprovide a stock of laughter by furnishing themselves from thepulpit</s>  but of all misbehaviour none is comparable to that ofthose who come here to sleep</s>  opium is not so stupefying to manypersons as an afternoon sermon</s>  perpetual custom hath so brought itabout that the words of whatever preacher become only a sort ofuniform sound at a distance than which nothing is more effectual tolull the senses</s>  for that it is the very sound of the sermon whichbindeth up their faculties is manifest from hence because they allawake so very regularly as soon as it ceaseth and with muchdevotion receive the blessing dozed and besotted with indecencies iam ashamed to repeat</s> i proceed secondly to reckon up some of the usual quarrels menhave against preaching and to show the unreasonableness of them</s> such unwarrantable behaviour as i have described among christians inthe house of god in a solemn assembly while their faith and dutyare explained and delivered have put those who are guilty uponinventing some excuses to extenuate their fault this they do byturning the blame either upon the particular preacher or uponpreaching in general</s>
 first they object against the particularpreacher his manner his delivery his voice are disagreeablehis style and expression are flat and slow sometimes improper andabsurd the matter is heavy trivial and insipid sometimesdespicable and perfectly ridiculous or else on the other side heruns up into unintelligible speculation empty notions andabstracted flights all clad in words above usual understandings</s> secondly they object against preaching in general</s>
 it is a perfectroad of talk they know already whatever can be said they haveheard the same a hundred times over</s>  they quarrel that preachers donot relieve an old beaten subject with wit and invention and thatnow the art is lost of moving mens passions so common among theancient orators of greece and rome</s>  these and the like objectionsare frequently in the mouths of men who despise the foolishness ofpreaching</s>  but let us examine the reasonableness of them</s> the doctrine delivered by all preachers is the same so we preachand so ye believe</s>  but the manner of delivering is suited to theskill and abilities of each which differ in preachers just as inthe rest of mankind</s>  however in personal dislikes of a particularpreacher are these men sure they are always in the right</s>  do theyconsider how mixed a thing is every audience whose taste andjudgment differ perhaps every day not only from each other butthemselves</s>  and how to calculate a discourse that shall exactlysuit them all is beyond the force and reach of human reasonknowledge or invention</s>  wit and eloquence are shining qualitiesthat god hath imparted in great degrees to very few nor any more tobe expected in the generality of any rank among men than riches andhonour</s>  but further if preaching in general be all old and beatenand that they are already so well acquainted with it more shame andguilt to them who so little edify by it</s>  but these men whose earsare so delicate as not to endure a plain discourse of religion whoexpect a constant supply of wit and eloquence on a subject handledso many thousand times what will they say when we turn theobjection upon themselves who with all the rude and profaneliberty of discourse they take upon so many thousand subjects areso dull as to furnish nothing but tedious repetitions and littlepaltry nauseous commonplaces so vulgar so worn or so obviousas upon any other occasion but that of advancing vice would behooted off the stage</s>  nor lastly are preachers justly blamed forneglecting human oratory to move the passions which is not thebusiness of a christian orator whose office it is only to work uponfaith and reason</s>  all other eloquence hath been a perfect cheat tostir up mens passions against truth and justice for the service ofa faction to put false colours upon things and by an amusement ofagreeable words make the worst reason appear to be the better</s> this is certainly not to be allowed in christian eloquence andtherefore st</s>  paul took quite the other course</s>  he came not withthe excellency of words or enticing speech of mens wisdom but inplain evidence of the spirit and power</s>  and perhaps it was forthat reason the young man eutychus used to the grecian eloquencegrew tired and fell so fast asleep</s> i go on thirdly to set forth the great evil of this neglect andscorn of preaching and to discover the real causes whence itproceedeth</s> i think it is obvious that this neglect of preaching hath very muchoccasioned the great decay of religion among us</s>  to this may beimputed no small part of that contempt some men bestow on theclergy for whoever talketh without being regarded is sure to bedespised</s>  to this we owe in a great measure the spreading ofatheism and infidelity among us for religion like all otherthings is soonest put out of countenance by being ridiculed</s>
 thescorn of preaching might perhaps have been at first introduced bymen of nice ears and refined taste but it is now become a spreadingevil through all degrees and both sexes for since sleepingtalking and laughing are qualities sufficient to furnish out acritic the meanest and most ignorant have set up a title andsucceeded in it as well as their betters</s>  thus are the last effortsof reforming mankind rendered wholly useless</s>
 how shall theyhear saith the apostle without a preacher</s>  but if they have apreacher and make it a point of wit or breeding not to hear himwhat remedy is left</s>  to this neglect of preaching we may alsoentirely impute that gross ignorance among us in the very principlesof religion which it is amazing to find in persons who very muchvalue their own knowledge and understanding in other things yet itis a visible inexcusable ignorance even in the meanest among usconsidering the many advantages they have of learning their duty</s> and it hath been the great encouragement to all manner of vice forin vain we preach down sin to a people whose hearts are waxedgross whose ears are dull of hearing and whose eyes are closed</s> therefore christ himself in his discourses frequently rouseth up theattention of the multitude and of his disciples themselves withthis expression he that hath ears to hear let him hear</s>  butamong all neglects of preaching none is so fatal as that ofsleeping in the house of god</s>  a scorner may listen to truth andreason and in time grow serious an unbeliever may feel the pangsof a guilty conscience one whose thoughts or eyes wander amongother objects may by a lucky word be called back to attention butthe sleeper shuts up all avenues to his soul he is like the deafadder that hearkeneth not to the voice of the charmer charm henever so wisely and we may preach with as good success to thegrave that is under his feet</s> but the great evil of this neglect will further yet appear fromconsidering the real causes whence it proceedeth whereof the firsti take to be an evil conscience</s>  many men come to church to save orgain a reputation or because they will not be singular but complywith an established custom yet all the while they are loaded withthe guilt of old rooted sins</s>  these men can expect to hear ofnothing but terrors and threatenings their sins laid open in truecolours and eternal misery the reward of them therefore no wonderthey stop their care and divert their thoughts and seek anyamusement rather than stir the hell within them</s> another cause of this neglect is a heart set upon worldly things</s> men whose minds are much enslaved to earthly affairs all the weekcannot disengage or break the chain of their thoughts so suddenly asto apply to a discourse that is wholly foreign to what they havemost at heart</s>  tell a usurer of charity and mercy andrestitutionyou talk to the deaf his heart and soul with all hissenses are got among his bags or he is gravely asleep and dreamingof a mortgage</s>  tell a man of business that the cares of the worldchoke the good seed that we must not encumber ourselves with muchserving that the salvation of his soul is the one thing necessaryyou see indeed the shape of a man before you but his facultiesare all gone off among clients and papers thinking how to defend abad cause or find flaws in a good one or he weareth out the time indrowsy nods</s> a third cause of the great neglect and scorn of preaching arisethfrom the practice of men who set up to decry and disparage religionthese being zealous to promote infidelity and vice learn a rote ofbuffoonery that serveth all occasions and refutes the strongestarguments for piety and good manners</s>  these have a set of ridiculecalculated for all sermons and all preachers and can be extremelywitty as often as they please upon the same fund</s>

it is remarkable that about the time of our saviours coming intothe world all kinds of learning flourished to a very great degreeinsomuch that nothing is more frequent in the mouths of many meneven such who pretend to read and to know than an extravagantpraise and opinion of the wisdom and virtue of the gentile sages ofthose days and likewise of those ancient philosophers who wentbefore them whose doctrines are left upon record either bythemselves or other writers</s>  as far as this may be taken forgranted it may be said that the providence of god brought thisabout for several very wise ends and purposes for it is certainthat these philosophers had been a long time before searching outwhere to fix the true happiness of man and not being able to agreeupon any certainty about it they could not possibly but concludeif they judged impartially that all their inquiries were in the endbut vain and fruitless the consequence of which must be not only anacknowledgment of the weakness of all human wisdom but likewise anopen passage hereby made for letting in those beams of light whichthe glorious sunshine of the gospel then brought into the world byrevealing those hidden truths which they had so long before beenlabouring to discover and fixing the general happiness of mankindbeyond all controversy and dispute</s>  and therefore the providence ofgod wisely suffered men of deep genius and learning then to arisewho should search into the truth of the gospel now made known andcanvass its doctrines with all the subtilty and knowledge they weremasters of and in the end freely acknowledge that to be the truewisdom only which cometh from above</s> however to make a further inquiry into the truth of thisobservation i doubt not but there is reason to think that a greatmany of those encomiums given to ancient philosophers are taken upontrust and by a sort of men who are not very likely to be at thepains of an inquiry that would employ so much time and thinking</s> for the usual ends why men affect this kind of discourse appeargenerally to be either out of ostentation that they may pass uponthe world for persons of great knowledge and observation or whatis worse there are some who highly exalt the wisdom of thosegentile sages thereby obliquely to glance at and traduce divinerevelation and more especially that of the gospel for theconsequence they would have us draw is this that since thoseancient philosophers rose to a greater pitch of wisdom and virtuethan was ever known among christians and all this purely upon thestrength of their own reason and liberty of thinking therefore itmust follow that either all revelation is false or what is worsethat it has depraved the nature of man and left him worse than itfound him</s>
but this high opinion of heathen wisdom is not very ancient in theworld nor at all countenanced from primitive times</s>  our saviourhad but a low esteem of it as appears by his treatment of thepharisees and sadducees who followed the doctrines of plato andepicurus</s>

 for to say as the most plausible of them did thathappiness consisted in virtue was but vain babbling and a meresound of words to amuse others and themselves because they were notagreed what this virtue was or wherein it did consist and likewisebecause several among the best of them taught quite differentthings placing happiness in health or good fortune in riches or inhonour where all were agreed that virtue was not as i shall haveoccasion to show when i speak of their particular tenets</s> the second great defect in the gentile philosophy was that it wantedsome suitable reward proportioned to the better part of manhismind as an encouragement for his progress in virtue</s>  thedifficulties they met with upon the score of this default weregreat and not to be accounted for bodily goods being onlysuitable to bodily wants are no rest at all for the mind and ifthey were yet are they not the proper fruits of wisdom and virtuebeing equally attainable by the ignorant and wicked</s>  now humannature is so constituted that we can never pursue anything heartilybut upon hopes of a reward</s>  if we run a race it is in expectationof a prize and the greater the prize the faster we run for anincorruptible crown if we understand it and believe it to be suchmore than a corruptible one</s>  but some of the philosophers gave allthis quite another turn and pretended to refine so far as to callvirtue its own reward and worthy to be followed only for itselfwhereas if there be anything in this more than the sound of thewords it is at least too abstracted to become a universalinfluencing principle in the world and therefore could not be ofgeneral use</s> it was the want of assigning some happiness proportioned to the soulof man that caused many of them either on the one hand to be sourand morose supercilious and untreatable or on the other to fallinto the vulgar pursuits of common men to hunt after greatness andriches to make their court and to serve occasions as plato did tothe younger dionysius and aristotle to alexander the great</s>  soimpossible it is for a man who looks no further than the presentworld to fix himself long in a contemplation where the present worldhas no part he has no sure hold no firm footing he can neverexpect to remove the earth he rests upon while he has no supportbesides for his feet but wants like archimedes some other placewhereon to stand</s>  to talk of bearing pain and grief without anysort of present or future hope cannot be purely greatness of spiritthere must be a mixture in it of affectation and an alloy of prideor perhaps is wholly counterfeit</s> it is true there has been all along in the world a notion of rewardsand punishments in another life but it seems to have rather servedas an entertainment to poets or as a terror of children than asettled principle by which men pretended to govern any of theiractions</s>  the last celebrated words of socrates a little before hisdeath do not seem to reckon or build much upon any such opinionand caesar made no scruple to disown it and ridicule it in opensenate</s> thirdly the greatest and wisest of all their philosophers werenever able to give any satisfaction to others and themselves intheir notions of a deity</s>  they were often extremely gross andabsurd in their conceptions and those who made the fairestconjectures are such as were generally allowed by the learned tohave seen the system of moses if i may so call it who was in greatreputation at that time in the heathen world as we find bydiodorus justin longinus and other authors for the rest thewisest among them laid aside all notions after a deity as adisquisition vain and fruitless which indeed it was upon unrevealedprinciples and those who ventured to engage too far fell intoincoherence and confusion</s> fourthly those among them who had the justest conceptions of adivine power and did also admit a providence had no notion at allof entirely relying and depending upon either they trusted inthemselves for all things but as for a trust or dependence upongod they would not have understood the phrase it made no part ofthe profane style</s> therefore it was that in all issues and events which they could notreconcile to their own sentiments of reason and justice they werequite disconcerted they had no retreat but upon every blow ofadverse fortune either affected to be indifferent or grew sullenand severe or else yielded and sunk like other men</s> having now produced certain points wherein the wisdom and virtue ofall unrevealed philosophy fell short and was very imperfect i goon in the second place to show in several instances where someof the most renowned philosophers have been grossly defective intheir lessons of morality</s> thales the founder of the ionic sect so celebrated for moralitybeing asked how a man might bear illfortune with greatest easeanswered by seeing his enemies in a worse condition</s>  an answertruly barbarous unworthy of human nature and which included suchconsequences as must destroy all society from the world</s> solon lamenting the death of a son one told him you lament invain</s>  therefore said he i lament because it is in vain</s> this was a plain confession how imperfect all his philosophy wasand that something was still wanting</s>  he owned that all his wisdomand morals were useless and this upon one of the most frequentaccidents in life</s>  how much better could he have learned to supporthimself even from david by his entire dependence upon god and thatbefore our saviour had advanced the notions of religion to theheight and perfection wherewith he hath instructed his disciples</s> plato himself with all his refinements placed happiness in wisdomhealth good fortune honour and riches and held that they whoenjoyed all these were perfectly happy which opinion was indeedunworthy its owner leaving the wise and good man wholly at themercy of uncertain chance and to be miserable without resource</s> his scholar aristotle fell more grossly into the same notion andplainly affirmed that virtue without the goods of fortune wasnot sufficient for happiness but that a wise man must be miserablein poverty and sickness</s>  nay diogenes himself from whose prideand singularity one would have looked for other notions deliveredit as his opinion that a poor old man was the most miserable thingin life</s> zeno also and his followers fell into many absurdities among whichnothing could be greater than that of maintaining all crimes to beequal which instead of making vice hateful rendered it as a thingindifferent and familiar to all men</s>
lastly epicurus had no notion of justice but as it was profitableand his placing happiness in pleasure with all the advantages hecould expound it by was liable to very great exception foralthough he taught that pleasure did consist in virtue yet he didnot any way fix or ascertain the boundaries of virtue as he oughtto have done by which means he misled his followers into thegreatest vices making their names to become odious and scandalouseven in the heathen world</s> i have produced these few instances from a great many others to showthe imperfection of heathen philosophy wherein i have confinedmyself wholly to their morality</s>  and surely we may pronounce uponit in the words of st</s>  james that this wisdom descended not fromabove but was earthly and sensual</s>  what if i had produced theirabsurd notions about god and the soul</s>  it would then have completedthe character given it by that apostle and appeared to have beendevilish too</s>  but it is easy to observe from the nature of thesefew particulars that their defects in morals were purely theflagging and fainting of the mind for want of a support byrevelation from god</s> i proceed therefore in the third place to show the perfection ofchristian wisdom from above and i shall endeavour to make it appearfrom those proper characters and marks of it by the apostle beforementioned in the third chapter and 15th 16th and 17th verses</s> the words run thus this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensualdevilish</s> for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evilwork</s>

 it is easy to answer first thatalthough the number of pretended christians be great yet that oftrue believers in proportion to the other was never so small andit is a true lively faith alone that by the assistance of godsgrace can influence our practice</s> secondly we may answer that christianity itself has very muchsuffered by being blended up with gentile philosophy</s>  the platonicsystem first taken into religion was thought to have given matterfor some early heresies in the church</s>  when disputes began toarise the peripatetic forms were introduced by scotus as bestfitted for controversy</s>  and however this may now have becomenecessary it was surely the author of a litigious vein which hassince occasioned very pernicious consequences stopped the progressof christianity and been a great promoter of vice verifying thatsentence given by st</s>  james and mentioned before where envyingand strife is there is confusion and every evil work</s>  this wasthe fatal stop to the grecians in their progress both of arts andarms their wise men were divided under several sects and theirgovernments under several commonwealths all in opposition to eachother which engaged them in eternal quarrels among themselveswhile they should have been armed against the common enemy</s>  and iwish we had no other examples from the like causes less foreign orancient than that</s>  diogenes said socrates was a madman thedisciples of zeno and epicurus nay of plato and aristotle wereengaged in fierce disputes about the most insignificant trifles</s> and if this be the present language and practice among us christiansno wonder that christianity does not still produce the same effectswhich it did at first when it was received and embraced in itsutmost purity and perfection for such wisdom as this cannotdescend from above but must be earthly sensual devilish fullof confusion and every evil work whereas the wisdom from aboveis first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreatedfull of mercy and good fruits without partiality and withouthypocrisy</s>  this is the true heavenly wisdom which christianityonly can boast of and which the greatest of the heathen wise mencould never arrive at</s> now to god the father c</s> three prayers used by the dean for stella in her last sickness 1727i</s>
