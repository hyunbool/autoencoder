literature and lifethe young contributorby william dean howellsthe editors relations with the young contributorone of the trustiest jokes of the humorous paragrapher is that the editoris in great and constant dread of the young contributor but neither myexperience nor my observation bears out his theory of the case</s> of course one must not say anything to encourage a young person toabandon an honest industry in the vain hope of early honor and profitfrom literature but there have been and there will be literary men andwomen always and these in the beginning have nearly always been youngand i cannot see that there is risk of any serious harm in saying that itis to the young contributor the editor looks for rescue from the oldcontributor or from his failing force and charm</s> the chances naturally are against the young contributor and vastlyagainst him but if any periodical is to live and to live long it is bythe infusion of new blood and nobody knows this better than the editorwho may seem so unfriendly and uncareful to the young contributor</s>  thestrange voice the novel scene the odor of fresh woods and pastures newthe breath of morning the dawn of tomorrowthese are what the editor iseager for if he is fit to be an editor at all and these are what theyoung contributor alone can give him</s> a man does not draw near the sixties without wishing people to believethat he is as young as ever and he has not written almost as many booksas he has lived years without persuading himself that each new work ofhis has all the surprise of spring but possibly there are wonted traitsand familiar airs and graces in it which forbid him to persuade others</s>
i do not say these characteristics are not charming i am very far fromwishing to say that but i do say and must say that after the fiftiethtime they do not charm for the first time and this is where theadvantage of the new contributor lies if he happens to charm at all</s> i</s> the new contributor who does charm can have little notion how much hecharms his first reader who is the editor</s>
 that functionary may bidehis pleasure in a short stiff note of acceptance or he may mask his joyin a check of slender figure but the contributor may be sure that he hasmissed no merit in his work and that he has felt perhaps far more thanthe public will feel such delight as it can give</s> the contributor may take the acceptance as a token that his efforts havenot been neglected and that his achievements will always be warmlywelcomed that even his failures will be leniently and reluctantlyrecognized as failures and that he must persist long in failure beforethe friend he has made will finally forsake him</s> i do not wish to paint the situation wholly rose color the editor willhave his moods when he will not see so clearly or judge so justly as atother times when he will seem exacting and fastidious and will wantthis or that mistaken thing done to the story or poem or sketch whichthe author knows to be simply perfect as it stands but he is worthbearing with and he will be constant to the new contributor as long asthere is the least hope of him</s> the contributor may be the man or the woman of one story one poem onesketch for there are such but the editor will wait the evidence ofindefinite failure to this effect</s>  his hope always is that he or she isthe man or the woman of many stories many poems many sketches all asgood as the first</s> from my own long experience as a magazine editor i may say that theeditor is more doubtful of failure in one who has once done well than ofa second success</s>  after all the writer who can do but one good thing israrer than people are apt to think in their love of the improbable butthe real danger with a young contributor is that he may become his ownrival</s> what would have been quite good enough from him in the first instance isnot good enough in the second because he has himself fixed his standardso high</s>  his only hope is to surpass himself and not begin resting onhis laurels too soon perhaps it is never well soon or late to restupon ones laurels</s>  it is well for one to make ones self scarce andthe best way to do this is to be more and more jealous of perfection inones work</s> the editors conditions are that having found a good thing he must get asmuch of it as he can and the chances are that he will be less exactingthan the contributor imagines</s>  it is for the contributor to be exactingand to let nothing go to the editor as long as there is the possibilityof making it better</s>  he need not be afraid of being forgotten because hedoes not keep sending the editors memory is simply relentless he couldnot forget the writer who has pleased him if he would for such writersare few</s>
 i never lost faith in acontributor who had done a good thing to the end i expected another goodthing from him</s>  i think i was always at least as patient with him as hewas with me though he may not have known it</s> at the time i was connected with that periodical it had almost a monopolyof the work of longfellow emerson holmes lowell whittier mrs</s>  stoweparkman higginson aldrich stedman and many others not so well knownbut still well known</s>  these distinguished writers were frequentcontributors and they could be counted upon to respond to almost anyappeal of the magazine yet the constant effort of the editors was todiscover new talent and their wish was to welcome it</s> i know that so far as i was concerned the success of a youngcontributor was as precious as if i had myself written his paper or poemand i doubt if it gave him more pleasure</s>  the editor is in fact a sortof second self for the contributor equally eager that he should standwell with the public and able to promote his triumphs without egotismand share them without vanity</s> ii</s> in fact my curious experience was that if the public seemed not to feelmy delight in a contribution i thought good my vexation anddisappointment were as great as if the work hod been my own</s>  it was evengreater for if i had really written it i might have had my misgivings ofits merit but in the case of another i could not console myself withthis doubt</s>  the sentiment was at the same time one which i could notcherish for the work of an old contributor such a one stood more uponhis own feet and the young contributor may be sure that the editorspride selfinterest and sense of editorial infallibility will allprompt him to stand by the author whom he has introduced to the publicand whom he has vouched for</s>
 after all he must remember that he is but one of agreat many others and that the editors affections if constant arenecessarily divided</s>  it is good for the literary aspirant to realizevery early that he is but one of many for the vice of our comparativelyvirtuous craft is that it tends to make each of us imagine himselfcentral if not sole</s>
 the thing westrive for is recognition but when this comes it is apt to turn ourheads</s>  i should say then that it was better it should not come in agreat glare and aloud shout all at once but should steal slowly uponus ray by ray breath by breath</s> in the mean time if this happens we shall have several chances ofreflection and can ask ourselves whether we are really so great as weseem to other people or seem to seem</s> the prime condition of good work is that we shall get ourselves out ofour minds</s>  sympathy we need of course and encouragement but i am notsure that the lack of these is not a very good thing too</s>  praiseenervates flattery poisons but a smart brisk snub is always ratherwholesome</s> i should say that it was not at all a bad thing for a young contributorto get his manuscript back even after a first acceptance and even ageneral newspaper proclamation that he is one to make the immortalstremble for their wreaths of asphodelor is it amaranth</s>  i am neversure which</s> of course one must have ones hour or day or week of disabling theeditors judgment of calling him to ones self fool and rogue andwretch but after that if one is worth while at all one puts therejected thing by or sends it off to some other magazine and sets aboutthe capture of the erring editor with something better or at leastsomething else</s> iii</s> i think it a great pity that editors ever deal other than frankly withyoung contributors or put them off with smooth generalities of excuseinstead of saying they do not like this thing or that offered them</s>  itis impossible to make a criticism of all rejected manuscripts but in thecase of those which show promise i think it is quite possible and if iwere to sin my sins over again i think i should sin a little more on theside of candid severity</s>  i am sure i should do more good in that wayand i am sure that when i used to dissemble my real mind i did harm tothose whose feelings i wished to spare</s>  there ought not in fact to bequestion of feeling in the editors mind</s> i know from much suffering of my own that it is terrible to get back amanuscript but it is not fatal or i should have been dead a great manytimes before i was thirty when the thing mostly ceased for me</s>
to do this it is necessary to print contributions but whose they are orhow the writer will feel if they are not printed cannot be considered</s> the editor can consider only what they are and the young contributorwill do well to consider that although the editor may not be aninfallible judge or quite a good judge it is his business to judge andto judge without mercy</s>  mercy ought no more to qualify judgment in anartistic result than in a mathematical result</s> iv</s> i suppose since i used to have it myself that there is a superstitionwith most young contributors concerning their geographical position</s>  iused to think that it was a disadvantage to send a thing from a small orunknown place and that it doubled my insignificance to do so</s>  ibelieved that if my envelope had borne the postmark of new york orboston or some other city of literary distinction it would have arrivedon the editors table with a great deal more authority</s>  but i am surethis was a mistake from the first and when i came to be an editor myselfi constantly verified the fact from my own dealings with contributors</s> a contribution from a remote and obscure place at once piqued mycuriosity and i soon learned that the fresh things the original thingswere apt to come from such places and not from the literary centres</s>
one of the most interesting facts concerning the arts of all kinds isthat those who wish to give their lives to them do not appear where theappliances for instruction in them exist</s>  an artistic atmosphere doesnot create artists a literary atmosphere does not create literatorspoets and painters spring up where there was never a verse made or apicture seen</s> this suggests that god is no more idle now than he was at the beginningbut that he is still and forever shaping the human chaos into theinstruments and means of beauty</s>  it may also suggest to that scholarpride that vanity of technique which is so apt to vaunt itself in theteacher that the best he can do after all is to let the pupil teachhimself</s>  if he comes with divine authority to the thing he attempts hewill know how to use the appliances of which the teacher is only thefirst</s> the editor if he does not consciously perceive the truth willinstinctively feel it and will expect the acceptable young contributorfrom the country the village the small town and he will look eagerlyat anything that promises literature from montana or texas for he willknow that it also promises novelty</s> if he is a wise editor he will wish to hold his hand as much aspossible he will think twice before he asks the contributor to changethis or correct that he will leave him as much to himself as he can</s> the young contributor on his part will do well to realize this and toreceive all the editorial suggestions which are veiled commands in mostcases as meekly and as imaginatively as possible</s> the editor cannot always give his reasons however strongly he may feelthem but the contributor if sufficiently docile can always divinethem</s>  it behooves him to be docile at all times for this is merely thewillingness to learn and whether he learns that he is wrong or that theeditor is wrong still he gains knowledge</s> a great deal of knowledge comes simply from doing and a great deal morefrom doing over and this is what the editor generally means</s> i think that every author who is honest with himself must own that hiswork would be twice as good if it were done twice</s>  i was once sofortunately circumstanced that i was able entirely to rewrite one of mynovels and i have always thought it the best written or at leastindefinitely better than it would have been with a single writing</s>  as amatter of fact nearly all of them have been rewritten in a certain way</s> they have not actually been rewritten throughout as in the case i speakof but they have been gone over so often in manuscript and in proof thatthe effect has been much the same</s>
unless you are sensible of some strong frame within your work somethingvertebral it is best to renounce it and attempt something else in whichyou can feel it</s>  if you are secure of the frame you must observe thequality and character of everything you build about it you must touchyou must almost taste you must certainly test every material youemploy every bit of decoration must undergo the same scrutiny as thestructure</s> it will be some vague perception of the want of this vigilance in theyoung contributors work which causes the editor to return it to him forrevision with those suggestions which he will do well to make the mostof for when the editor once finds a contributor he can trust herejoices in him with a fondness which the contributor will never perhapsunderstand</s> it will not do to write for the editor alone the wise editor understandsthis and averts his countenance from the contributor who writes at himbut if he feels that the contributor conceives the situation and willconform to the conditions which his periodical has invented for itselfand will transgress none of its unwritten laws if he perceives that hehas put artistic conscience in every general and detail and though hehas not done the best has done the best that he can do he will begin toliberate him from every trammel except those he must wear himself andwill be only too glad to leave him free</s>  he understands if he is at allfit for his place that a writer can do well only what he likes to doand his wish is to leave him to himself as soon as possible</s> v</s> in my own case i noticed that the contributors who could be best left tothemselves were those who were most amenable to suggestion and evencorrection who took the blue pencil with a smile and bowed gladly tothe rod of the proofreader</s>  those who were on the alert for offencewho resented a marginal note as a slight and bumptiously demanded thattheir work should be printed just as they had written it were commonlynot much more desired by the reader than by the editor</s> of course the contributor naturally feels that the public is the test ofhis excellence but he must not forget that the editor is the beginningof the public and i believe he is a faithfuller and kinder critic thanthe writer will ever find again</s> since my time there is a new tradition of editing which i do not thinkso favorable to the young contributor as the old</s>  formerly the magazineswere made up of volunteer contributions in much greater measure than theyare now</s>
 at present most of the material is invited and even engaged itis arranged for a long while beforehand and the space that can be givento the aspirant the unknown good the potential excellence growsconstantly less and less</s> a great deal can be said for either tradition perhaps some editor willyet imagine a return to the earlier method</s>
 themoral to the young contributor is to be better than ever to leavenothing undone that shall enhance his small chances of acceptance</s> if he takes care to be so good that the editor must accept him in spiteof all the pressure upon his pages he will not only be servinghimselfbest but may be helping the editor to a conception of his duty thatshall be more hospitable to all other young contributors</s>  as it ishowever it must be owned that their hope of acceptance is very verysmall and they will do well to make sure that they love literature somuch that they can suffer long and often repeated disappointment in itscause</s> the love of it is the great and only test of fitness for it</s>  it isreally inconceivable how any one should attempt it without this butapparently a great many do</s>  it is evident to every editor that a vastnumber of those who write the things he looks at so faithfully and readsmore or less have no artistic motive</s> people write because they wish to be known or because they have heardthat money is easily made in that way or because they think they willchance that among a number of other things</s>  the ignorance of techniquewhich they often show is not nearly so disheartening as the palpablefactitiousness of their product</s>  it is something that they have made itis not anything that has grown out of their lives</s> i should think it would profit the young contributor before he puts pento paper to ask himself why he does so and if he finds that he has nomotive in the love of the thing to forbear</s> am i interested in what i am going to write about</s>  do i feel itstrongly</s>  do i know it thoroughly</s>  do i imagine it clearly</s>  the youngcontributor had better ask himself all these questions and as many morelike them as he can think of</s>

 did it give himpleasure</s>  did he love it as it grew under his hand</s>  was he glad andwilling with it</s>  or did he force himself to it and did it hang heavyupon him</s> there is nothing mystical in all this it is a matter of plain everydayexperience and i think nearly every artist will say the same thing aboutit if he examines himself faithfully</s> if the young contributor finds that he has no delight in the thing he hasattempted he may very well give it up for no one else will delight init</s>  but he need not give it up at once perhaps his mood is bad let himwait for a better and try it again</s>  he may not have learned how to doit well and therefore he cannot love it but perhaps he can learn to doit well</s> the wonder and glory of art is that it is without formulas</s>
