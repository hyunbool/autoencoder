possible reasons and unreasons for a woman changing hermind</s>  for instance while knowing that his grace was attractive hequite forgot that mrs</s>  charmond had also great pretensions to beauty</s> in his simple estimate an attractive woman attracted all around</s> so it was settled in his mind that her sudden mingling with thevillagers at the unlucky winterbornes was the cause of her

a mood as he was capable of but there hadbeen enthusiasm enough left in him one day at sherton abbas market topurchase this old mare which had belonged to a neighboring parson withseveral daughters and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or alady and to do odd jobs of carting and agriculture at a pinch</s>  thisobliging quadruped seemed to furnish giles with a means of reinstatinghimself in melburys good opinion as a man of considerateness bythrowing out future possibilities to grace</s> the latter looked at him with intensified interest this morning in themood which is altogether peculiar to womans nature and which whenreduced into plain words seems as impossible as the penetrability ofmatterthat of entertaining a tender pity for the object of her ownunnecessary coldness</s>  the imperturbable poise which marked winterbornein general was enlivened now by a freshness and animation that set abrightness in his eye and on his cheek</s>  mrs</s>  melbury asked him to havesome breakfast and he pleasurably replied that he would join themwith his usual lack of tactical observation not perceiving that theyhad all finished the meal that the hour was inconveniently late andthat the note piped by the kettle denoted it to be nearly empty sothat fresh water had to be brought in trouble taken to make it boiland a general renovation of the table carried out</s>  neither did heknow so full was he of his tender ulterior object in buying thathorse how many cups of tea he was gulping down one after another norhow the morning was slipping nor how he was keeping the family

conceived it and wasas firmly convinced as ever that the comradeship which grace had shownwith giles and his crew by attending his party had been the cause</s> matters lingered on thus</s>  and then

graces lips suckedin this native air of hers like milk</s>  they soon reached a place wherethe wood ran down into a corner and went outside it towardscomparatively open ground</s>  having looked round

 charmond</s>  oh she doesnt know theres such a tree onher estate</s>  besides shrouding is not felling and ill risk thatmuch</s> he went out and when afternoon came he returned took a billhook

it was gracemelbury on her way out from the house probably for a short eveningwalk before dark</s>  he arranged himself for a greeting from her sinceshe could hardly avoid passing immediately beneath

billhookto their places pursued his way homeward</s>  he would not allow thisincident to affect his outer conduct any more than the danger to hisleaseholds had done and went to bed as usual</s>  two

oak timber was to be sent away that morning to a builderwhose works were in a town many miles off</s>  the proud trunks were takenup from the silent spot which had known them through the buddings

backing was saved in the course of ayear by the warning notes they cast ahead moreover the tones of allthe teams in the district being known to the carters of each theycould tell a long way off on a dark night whether they were about toencounter friends or strangers</s> the fog of the previous evening still lingered so heavily over thewoods that the morning could not penetrate the trees till long afterits time</s>  the load being a ponderous one the lane crooked and theair so thick winterborne set out as he often did to accompany theteam as far as the corner where it would turn into a wider road</s> so they rumbled on shaking the foundations of the roadside cottages bythe weight of their progress the sixteen bells chiming harmoniouslyover all till they had risen out of the valley and were descendingtowards the more open route the sparks rising from their creaking skidand nearly setting fire to the dead leaves alongside</s> then occurred one of the very incidents against which the bells were anendeavor to guard</s>  suddenly there beamed into their eyes quite closeto them the two lamps of a carriage shorn of rays by the fog</s>  itsapproach had been quite unheard by reason of their own noise</s>  thecarriage was a covered one while behind it could be discerned anothervehicle laden with luggage</s> winterborne went to the head of the team and heard the coachmantelling the carter that he must turn back</s>  the carter declared thatthis was impossible</s> you can turn if you unhitch your stringhorses said the coachman</s> it is much easier for you to turn than for us said winterborne</s> weve five tons of timber on these wheels if weve an ounce</s> but ive another carriage with luggage at my back</s> winterborne admitted the strength of the argument</s>  but even withthat he said you can back better than we</s>  and you ought to foryou could hear our bells half a mile off</s> and you could see our lights</s> we couldnt because of the fog</s> well our times precious said the coachman haughtily</s>  you areonly going to some trumpery little village or other in theneighborhood while we are going straight to italy</s> driving all the way i suppose said winterborne sarcastically</s> the argument continued in these terms till a voice from the interior ofthe carriage inquired what was the matter</s>  it was a ladys</s> she was briefly informed of the timber peoples obstinacy and thengiles could hear her telling the footman to direct the timber people toturn their horses heads</s> the message was brought and winterborne sent the bearer back to saythat he begged the ladys pardon but that he could not do as sherequested that though he would not assert it to be impossible it wasimpossible by comparison with the slight difficulty to her party toback their light carriages</s>  as fate would have it the incident withgrace melbury on the previous day made giles less gentle than he mightotherwise have shown himself his confidence in the sex being rudelyshaken</s> in fine nothing could move him and the carriages were compelled toback till they reached one of the sidings or turnouts constructed inthe bank for the purpose</s>  then the team came on ponderously and theclanging of its sixteen bells as it passed the discomfited carriagestilted up against the bank lent a particularly triumphant tone to theteams progressa tone which in point of fact did not at all attachto its conductors feelings</s> giles walked behind the timber and just as he had got past the yetstationary carriages he heard a soft voice say who is that rude man</s> not melbury</s>  the sex of the speaker was so prominent in the voice thatwinterborne felt a pang of regret</s> no maam</s>  a younger man in a smaller way of business in littlehintock</s>

fitzpiers like others of hischaracter while despising melbury and his station did not at alldisdain to spend melburys money or appropriate to his own use thehorse which belonged to melburys

who over and above her ownattainments had been accustomed to those of a cultivated professionalman could ever be the wife of such as he</s> since the date of his rejection he had almost grown to see thereasonableness of that treatment</s>  he had said to himself again andagain that her father was right that the poor ceorl gileswinterborne would never have been able to make such a dainty girlhappy</s>  yet now that she had stood in a position farther removed fromhis own than at first he was asked to prepare to woo her</s>  he was fullof doubt</s> nevertheless it was not in him to show backwardness</s>  to act sopromptly as melbury desired him to act seemed indeed scarcely wisebecause of the uncertainty of events</s>  giles knew nothing of legalprocedure but he did know that for him to step up to grace as a loverbefore the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply anextravagant dream of her fathers overstrained mind</s>  he pitied melburyfor his almost childish

timbermerchant in his intense affection for grace wascourting him now because that young lady when disunited would be leftin an anomalous position to escape which a bad husband was better thannone</s>

melbury searched the garden the parsleybed and the orchard butcould find no trace of her and then he made inquiries at the cottagesof such of his workmen as had not gone to bed avoiding tangss becausehe knew the young people were to rise early to leave</s>  in theseinquiries one of the mens wives somewhat incautiously let out the factthat she had heard a scream in the wood though from which

of the village and in a short time lightedupon the mantrap</s>  its discovery simply added an item of fact withouthelping their conjectures but melburys indefinite alarm was greatlyincreased when holding a candle to the ground he saw in the teeth ofthe instrument some frayings from graces clothing</s>  no intelligence ofany kind was gained till they met a woodman of delborough who saidthat he had seen a lady answering to the description her father gave ofgrace walking through the wood on a gentlemans arm in the directionof sherton</s> was he clutching her tight</s>  said melbury</s> wellrather said the man</s> did she walk lame</s> well tis true her head hung over towards him a bit</s> creedle groaned tragically</s> melbury not suspecting the presence of fitzpiers coupled this

wentand in due course emerged upon the highway</s> nearing shertonabbas the previous information was confirmed by otherstrollers though the gentlemans supporting arm had disappeared fromthese later accounts</s>  at last they were so near sherton that melburyinformed his faithful followers that he did not wish to drag themfarther at so late an hour since he could go on alone and inquire ifthe woman who had been seen were really grace</s>  but they would notleave him alone in his anxiety and trudged onward till the lamplightfrom the town began to illuminate their fronts</s>  at the entrance
