the orthodox criticism toward bernard shaw</s>  he so obviouslydisregards all the canons and unities and other things which everywellbred dramatist is bound to respect that his work is really unworthyof serious criticism orthodox</s>  indeed he knows no more about thedramatic art than according to his own story in the man of destinynapoleon at tavazzano knew of the art of war</s>  but both men weresuccesses each in his waythe latter won victories and the formergained audiences in the very teeth of the accepted theories of war andthe theatre</s>  shaw does not know that it is unpardonable sin to have hischaracters make long speeches at one another apparently thinking thatthis embargo applies only to long speeches which consist mainly ofbombast and rhetoric</s>  there never was an author who showed lesspredilection for a specific medium by which to accomplish his results</s> he recognized early in his days many things awry in the world and heassumed the task of mundane reformation with a confident spirit</s>  itseems such a small job at twenty to set the times aright</s>  he began as anessayist but who reads essays nowadays</s> he then turned novelist withno better success for no one would read such preposterous stuff as hechose to emit</s>  he only succeeded in proving that absolutely rational menand womenalthough he has created few of the lattercan be mostextremely disagreeable to our conventional way of thinking</s> as a last resort he turned to the stage not that he cared for thedramatic art for no man seems to care less about art for arts

upon the scene when many of our social usagesare outworn</s>  he sees the fact announces it and we burst into guffaws</s> the continuous laughter which greets shaws plays arises from a realcontrast in the point of view of the dramatist and his audiences</s>  whenpinero or jones describes a whimsical situation we never doubt for amoment that the authors point of view is our own and that the

the house is in aroar</s>  who is right</s>  if we were really using our own senses and notgazing through the glasses of convention and romance and makebelieveshould we see things as shaw does</s> must it not cause shaw to doubt his own or the publics sanity to hearaudiences laughing boisterously over tragic situations</s>  and yet if theydid not come to laugh they would not come at all</s>  mockery is the pricehe must pay for a hearing</s>  or has he calculated to a nicety the power ofreaction</s>  does he seek to drive us to aspiration by the portrayal ofsordidness to disinterestedness

dares the charge terrible in proportion to itstruth which the most serious of us shrinks fromthe lack of a sense ofhumor</s>  men would rather have their integrity impugned</s> in arms and the man the

aboutanything</s> it is hard to speak too highly of candida</s>  no equally subtle andincisive study of domestic relations exists in the english drama</s>  onehas to turn to george merediths the egoist to find such characterdissection</s>  the central note of the play is that with the true womanweakness which appeals to the maternal instinct is more powerful thanstrength which offers
