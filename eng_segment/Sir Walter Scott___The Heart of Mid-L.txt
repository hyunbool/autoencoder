the candour oftheir eloquence assuredly proves that davie deans is not overdrawnindeed he is much less truculent than those who actually weretestifying even after his decease</s> in the heart of

scott</s>  effie has heart sincerity passion loyaltydespite her flightiness and her readiness when her chance comes toplay the fine lady</s>  it was distasteful to scott to create a character nothuman

nor does scotts art suffer from his kindliness andeffie in prison with a heart to be broken is not less pathetic than theheartless hetty in the same condemnation</s> as to her lover robertson or sir

commonly did put up and is believed to have been amarried man</s>  it is not very clear that the novel gains much by theelevation of the bristo innkeeper to a baronetcy except in so far aseffies appearance in the character of a great lady is entertaining andcharacteristic and jeanies conquest of her own envy is exemplary</s>  thechange in social rank calls for the tragic conclusion about which almostevery reader agrees with the criticism of lady louisa stuart and herfriends</s>  thus the novel filled more pages than mr</s>  jedediahcleishbotham had opined and hence comes a languor which does not besetthe story of old mortality</s>  scotts own love of adventure and ofstirring incidents at any cost is an excellent quality in a novelist butit does in this instance cause him somewhat to dilute those immortalstudies of scotch character which are the strength of his genius</s> the reader feels a lack of reality in the conclusion the fatal encounterof the father and the lost son an incident as old as the legend ofodysseus</s>  but this is more than atoned for by the admirable part of madgewildfire flitting like a feu follet up and down among the doucescotch and the dour

her husbandthe highland pride courage and absurdity of the captain ofknockdanderwhen we consider all these so various and perfectcreations we need not wonder that scott was in high glee over theheart

one criticised it more severely than he didhimself</s>  the edinburgh review about this time counselled the author ofwaverley to attempt a drama doubting only his powers of compression</s> possibly work at a drama might have been of advantage to the genius ofscott</s>  he was unskilled in selection and rejection which the dramaespecially demands</s>  but he detested the idea of writing for

heart of midlothian and his other novels buthe had no more desire than a senator of rome would have had to see hisname become famous by the theatre</s>  this confirmed repulsion in one solearned in the dramatic poets is a curious trait in scotts character</s> he could not accommodate his genius to the needs of the stage and thatcrown which has most potently allured most men of genius he would

empty noose things so simple inthemselves became on such an occasion objects of terror and of solemninterest</s> amid so numerous an assembly there was scarcely a word spoken save inwhispers</s>  the thirst of vengeance was in some degree allayed by itssupposed certainty and even the populace with deeper feeling than theyare wont to entertain suppressed all clamorous exultation and preparedto enjoy the scene of retaliation in triumph silent and decent thoughstern and relentless</s>  it seemed as if the depth of their hatred to theunfortunate criminal scorned to display itself in anything resembling themore noisy current of their ordinary feelings</s>  had a stranger consultedonly the evidence of his ears he might have supposed that so vast amultitude were assembled for some purpose which affected them with thedeepest sorrow and stilled those noises which on all ordinaryoccasions arise from such a concourse but if he had gazed upon theirfaces he would have been instantly undeceived</s>  the compressed lip thebent brow the stern and flashing eye of almost everyone on whom helooked conveyed the expression of men come to glut their sight withtriumphant revenge</s>  it is probable that the appearance of the criminalmight have somewhat changed the temper of the populace in his favour andthat they might in the moment of death have forgiven the man against whomtheir resentment had been so fiercely heated</s>  it had however beendestined that the mutability of their sentiments was not to be exposedto this trial</s> the usual hour for producing the criminal had been past for many minutesyet the spectators observed no symptom of his appearance</s>  would theyventure to defraud public justice</s>  was the question which men begananxiously to ask at each other</s>  the first answer in every case was boldand positivethey dare not</s>  but when the point was further canvassedother opinions were entertained and various causes of doubt weresuggested</s>  porteous had been a favourite officer of the magistracy of thecity which being a numerous and fluctuating body requires for itssupport a degree of energy in its functionaries which the individualswho compose it cannot at all times alike be supposed to possess in theirown persons</s>  it was remembered that in the information for porteous thepaper namely in which his case was stated to the judges of the criminalcourt he had been described by his counsel as the person on whom themagistrates chiefly relied in all emergencies of uncommon difficulty</s>  itwas argued too that his conduct on the unhappy occasion of wilsonsexecution was capable of being attributed to an imprudent excess of zealin the execution of his duty a motive for which those under whoseauthority he acted might be supposed to have great sympathy</s>  and as theseconsiderations might move the magistrates to make a favourablerepresentation of porteouss case there were not wanting others in thehigher departments of government which would make such suggestionsfavourably listened to</s> the mob of edinburgh when thoroughly excited had been at all times oneof the fiercest which could be found in europe and of late years theyhad risen repeatedly against the government and sometimes not withouttemporary success</s>  they were conscious therefore that they were nofavourites with the rulers of the period and that if captain porteoussviolence was not altogether regarded as good service it might certainlybe thought that to visit it with a capital punishment would render itboth delicate and dangerous for future officers in the samecircumstances to act with effect in repressing tumults</s>  there is also anatural feeling on the part of all members of government for thegeneral maintenance of authority and it seemed not unlikely that whatto the relatives of the sufferers appeared a wanton and unprovokedmassacre should be otherwise viewed in the cabinet of st</s>  jamess</s>  itmight be there supposed that upon the whole matter captain porteous wasin the exercise of a trust delegated to him by the lawful civilauthority that he had been assaulted by the populace and several of hismen hurt and that in finally repelling force by force his conductcould be fairly imputed to no other motive than selfdefence in thedischarge of his duty</s> these considerations of themselves very powerful induced the spectatorsto apprehend the possibility of a reprieve and to the various causeswhich might interest the rulers in his favour the lower part of therabble added one which was peculiarly well adapted to theircomprehension</s>  it was averred in order to increase the odium againstporteous that while he repressed with the utmost severity the slightestexcesses of the poor he not only overlooked the license of the youngnobles and gentry but was very willing to lend them the countenance ofhis official authority in execution of such loose pranks as it waschiefly his duty to have restrained</s>  this suspicion which was perhapsmuch exaggerated made a deep impression on the minds of the populaceand when several of the higher rank joined in a petition recommendingporteous to the mercy of the crown it was generally supposed he owedtheir favour not to any conviction of the hardship of his case but tothe fear of losing a convenient accomplice in their debaucheries</s>  it isscarcely necessary to say how much this suspicion augmented the peoplesdetestation of this obnoxious criminal as well as their fear of hisescaping the sentence pronounced against him</s> while these arguments were stated and replied to and canvassed andsupported the hitherto silent expectation of the people became changedinto that deep and agitating murmur which is sent forth by the oceanbefore the tempest begins to howl</s>  the crowded populace as if theirmotions had corresponded with the unsettled state of their mindsfluctuated to and fro without any visible cause of impulse like theagitation of the waters called by sailors the groundswell</s>  the newswhich the magistrates had almost hesitated to communicate to them wereat length announced and spread among the spectators with a rapidity

absence ofgeorge ii</s>  on the continent that the execution of the sentence of deathpronounced against john porteous late captainlieutenant of the cityguard of edinburgh present prisoner in the tolbooth of that city berespited for six weeks from the time appointed for his execution</s> the assembled spectators of almost all degrees whose minds had beenwound up to the pitch which we have described uttered a groan or rathera roar of indignation and disappointed revenge similar to that of atiger from whom his meal has been rent by his keeper when he was justabout to devour it</s>  this fierce exclamation seemed to forbode someimmediate explosion of popular resentment and in fact such had beenexpected by the magistrates and the necessary measures had been taken torepress it</s>  but the shout was not repeated nor did any sudden tumultensue such as it appeared to announce</s>  the populace seemed to be ashamedof having expressed their disappointment in a vain clamour and the soundchanged not into the silence which had preceded the arrival of thesestunning news but into stifled mutterings which each group maintainedamong themselves and which were blended into one deep and hoarse murmurwhich floated above the assembly</s> yet still though all expectation of the execution was over the mobremained assembled stationary as it were through very resentmentgazing on the preparations for death which had now been made in vainand stimulating their feelings by recalling the various claims whichwilson might have had on royal mercy from the mistaken motives on whichhe acted as well as from the generosity he had displayed towards hisaccomplice</s>  this man they saidthe brave the resolute thegenerous was executed to death without mercy for stealing a purse ofgold which in some sense he might consider as a fair reprisal while theprofligate satellite who took advantage of a trifling tumultinseparable from such occasions to shed the blood of twenty of hisfellowcitizens is deemed a fitting object for the exercise of the royalprerogative of mercy</s>  is this to be borne</s> would our fathers have borneit</s>  are not we like them scotsmen and burghers of edinburgh</s> the officers of justice began now to remove the scaffold and otherpreparations which had been made for the execution in hopes by doingso to accelerate the dispersion of the multitude</s>  the measure had thedesired effect for no sooner had the fatal tree been unfixed from thelarge stone pedestal or socket in which it was secured and sunk slowlydown upon the wain intended to remove it to the place where it wasusually deposited than the populace after giving vent to their feelingsin a second shout of rage and mortification began slowly to disperse totheir usual abodes and occupations</s> the windows were in like manner gradually deserted and groups of themore decent class of citizens formed themselves as if waiting to returnhomewards when the streets should be cleared of the rabble</s>  contrary towhat is frequently the case this description of persons agreed ingeneral with the sentiments of their inferiors and considered the causeas common to all ranks</s>  indeed as we have already noticed it was by nomeans amongst the lowest class of the spectators or those most likely tobe engaged in the riot at wilsons execution that the fatal fire ofporteouss soldiers had taken effect</s>  several persons were killed whowere looking out at windows at the scene who could not of course belongto the rioters and were persons of decent rank and condition</s>  theburghers therefore resenting the loss which had fallen on their ownbody and proud and tenacious of their rights as the citizens ofedinburgh have at all times been were greatly exasperated at theunexpected respite of captain porteous</s> it was noticed at the time and afterwards more particularly rememberedthat while the mob were in the act of dispersing several individualswere seen busily passing from one place and one group of people toanother remaining long with none but whispering for a little time withthose who appeared to be declaiming most violently against the conduct ofgovernment</s>  these active agents had the appearance of men from thecountry and were generally supposed to be old friends and confederatesof wilson whose minds were of course highly excited against porteous</s> if however it was the intention of these men to stir the multitude toany sudden act of mutiny it seemed for the time to be fruitless</s>  therabble as well as the more decent part of the assembly dispersed andwent home peaceably and it was only by observing the moody discontent ontheir brows or catching the tenor of the conversation they held witheach other that a stranger

because there was quarteredin the canongate at that time a regiment of infantry commanded bycolonel moyle which might have occupied the city by advancing throughthis gate and would possess the power of totally defeating theirpurpose</s>  the leaders therefore hastened to the netherbow port which theysecured in the same manner and with as little trouble as the othergates leaving a party to watch

with any written order which iffound on his person by an enraged mob might have cost him his life andthe issue of the application was that colonel moyle having no writtenrequisition from the civil

appalling in the form or manners of this rusticheroine yet whether from sheepish bashfulness or from want of decisionand imperfect knowledge of his own mind on the subject the laird ofdumbiedikes with his old laced hat and empty tobaccopipe came andenjoyed the beatific vision of jeanie deans day after day week afterweek year after year without proposing to accomplish any of theprophecies of the

teaching the younger lads the knowledge he himself acquiredand thus at once gaining the means of maintaining himself at the seat oflearning and fixing in his mind the elements of what he had alreadyobtained</s>  in this manner as is usual among the poorer students ofdivinity at scottish universities he contrived not only to maintainhimself according to his simple wants but even to send considerableassistance to his sole remaining parent a sacred duty of which thescotch are seldom negligent</s>  his progress in knowledge of a general kindas well as in the studies proper to his profession was veryconsiderable but was little remarked owing to the retired modesty ofhis disposition which in no respect qualified him to set off hislearning to the best advantage</s>  and thus had butler been a man given tomake complaints he had his tale to tell like others of unjustpreferences bad luck and hard usage</s>  on these subjects however he washabitually silent perhaps from modesty perhaps from a touch of prideor perhaps from a conjunction of both</s> he obtained his license as a preacher of the gospel with somecompliments from the presbytery by whom it was bestowed but this did notlead to any preferment and he found it necessary to make the cottage atbeersheba his residence for some months with no other income than wasafforded by the precarious occupation of teaching in one

eachindividual of the cloth that he bestowed his approbation and a littlejealous perhaps at seeing his youthful acquaintance erected into thedignity of a teacher and preacher he instantly attacked him upon variouspoints of controversy in order to discover whether he might not havefallen into some of the snares defections and desertions of the time</s> butler was not only a man of stanch presbyterian principles but was alsowilling to avoid giving pain to his old friend by disputing upon pointsof little importance and therefore he might have hoped to have come likefine gold out of the

as the bunker at woodend and no face heloved so much to gaze on as jeanie deanss</s>  so after spinning round andround his little orbit and then remaining stationary for a week itseems to have

independent in civil andreligious principles was not without that respect for the laird of theland so deeply imprinted on the scottish tenantry of the period</s> moreover if he did not positively

from possessing that cool insensibility todanger which is the happy portion of men of stronger health more firmnerves and less acute sensibility</s>  an indistinct idea of peril which hecould neither understand nor ward off seemed to float before his eyes</s> he tried to think over the events of the preceding night in hopes ofdiscovering some means of explaining or vindicating his conduct

under the observationof any disinterested witness in the attempts that he made from time totime to expostulate with the rioters and to prevail on them to releasehim</s>  the distress of deanss family

conducted his inquiry civilly but yet in a manner whichgave him to understand that he laboured under strong suspicion</s>  with afrankness which at once became his calling and character butler avowedhis involuntary presence at the murder of porteous and at the requestof the magistrate entered into a minute detail of the circumstanceswhich attended that unhappy affair</s>  all the particulars such as we havenarrated were taken minutely down by the clerk from butlers dictation</s> when the narrative was concluded the crossexamination commenced whichit is a painful task even for the most candid witness to undergo since astory especially if connected with agitating and alarming incidents canscarce be so clearly and distinctly told but that some ambiguity anddoubt may be thrown upon it by a string of successive and minuteinterrogatories</s> the magistrate commenced by observing that butler had said his objectwas to return to the village of libberton but that he was interrupted bythe mob at the west port</s>  is the west port your usual way of leavingtown when you go to libberton</s>  said the magistrate with a sneer</s> no certainly answered butler with the haste of a man anxious tovindicate the accuracy of his evidence but i chanced to be nearer thatport than any other and the hour of shutting the gates was on the pointof striking</s> that was unlucky said the magistrate drily</s>  pray being as you sayunder coercion and fear of the lawless multitude and compelled toaccompany them through scenes disagreeable to all men of humanity andmore especially irreconcilable to the profession of a minister did younot attempt to struggle resist or escape from their violence</s> butler replied that their numbers prevented him from attemptingresistance and their vigilance from effecting his escape</s> that was unlucky again repeated the magistrate in the same dryinacquiescent tone of voice and manner</s>  he proceeded with decency andpoliteness but with a stiffness which argued his continued suspicion toask many questions concerning the behaviour of the mob the manners anddress of the ringleaders and when he conceived that the caution ofbutler if he was deceiving him must be lulled asleep the magistratesuddenly and artfully returned to former parts of his declaration andrequired a new recapitulation of the circumstances to the minutest andmost trivial point which attended each part of the melancholy scene</s>  noconfusion or contradiction however occurred that could countenance thesuspicion which he seemed to have adopted against butler</s>  at length thetrain of his interrogatories reached madge wildfire at whose name themagistrate and townclerk exchanged significant glances</s>  if the fate ofthe good town had depended on her careful magistrates knowing thefeatures and dress of this personage his inquiries could not have beenmore particular</s>  but butler could say almost nothing of this personsfeatures which were disguised apparently with red paint and soot likean indian going to battle besides the projecting shade of a curch orcoif which muffled the hair of the supposed female</s>  he declared that hethought he could not know this madge wildfire if placed before him in adifferent dress but that he believed he might recognise her voice</s> the magistrate requested him again to state by what gate he left thecity</s> by the cowgate port replied butler</s> was that the nearest road to libberton</s> no answered butler with embarrassment but it was the nearest way

will myself testify in your favour</s>  but weare aware there has been at times a sort of bastard and fiery zeal insome of your order and those men irreproachable in other points whichhas led them

from this indulgence ofpassion</s>  but a moments recollection induced her to check herself for agrief selfish and proper to her own affections while her father andsister were plunged into such deep and irretrievable affliction</s>  she drewfrom her pocket the letter which had been that morning flung into herapartment through an open window and the contents of which were assingular as the

her sister</s>  theletter concluded with incoherent but violent protestations that inobeying this summons she had nothing to fear personally</s> the message delivered to her by butler from the stranger in the parktallied exactly with the contents of the letter but assigned a laterhour and a different place of meeting</s>  apparently the writer of theletter had been compelled to let butler so far into his confidence forthe sake of announcing this change to jeanie</s>  she was more than once onthe point of producing the billet in vindication of herself from herlovers halfhinted suspicions</s>  but there is something in stooping tojustification which the pride of innocence does not at all timeswillingly submit to besides that the threats contained in the letter incase of her betraying the secret hung heavy on her heart</s>  it isprobable however that had they remained longer together she might havetaken the resolution to submit the whole matter to butler and be guidedby him as to the line of conduct which she should adopt</s>  and when by thesudden interruption of their conference she lost the opportunity ofdoing so she felt as if she had been unjust to a friend whose advicemight have been highly useful and whose attachment deserved her full andunreserved confidence</s> to have recourse to her father upon this occasion she considered ashighly imprudent</s>  there was no possibility of conjecturing in what lightthe matter might strike old david whose manner of acting and thinking inextraordinary circumstances depended upon feelings and principlespeculiar to himself the operation of which could not be calculated uponeven by those best acquainted with him</s>  to have requested some femalefriend to have accompanied her to the place of rendezvous would perhapshave been the most eligible expedient but the threats of the writerthat betraying his secret would prevent their meeting on which hersisters safety was said to depend from taking place at all would havedeterred her from making such a confidence even had she known a personin whom she thought it could with safety have been reposed</s>  but she knewnone such</s>  their acquaintance with the cottagers in the vicinity had beenvery slight and limited to trifling acts of good neighbourhood</s>  jeanieknew little of them and what she knew did not greatly incline her totrust any of them</s>  they were of the order of loquacious goodhumouredgossips usually found in their situation of life and their conversationhad at all times few charms for a young woman to whom nature and thecircumstance of a solitary life had given a depth of thought and force ofcharacter superior to the frivolous part of her sex whether in high orlow degree</s> left alone and separated from all earthly counsel she had recourse to afriend and adviser whose ear is open to the cry of the poorest and mostafflicted of his people</s>  she knelt and prayed with fervent sinceritythat god would please to direct her what course to follow in her arduousand distressing situation</s>  it was the belief of the time and sect towhich she belonged that special answers to prayer differing little intheir character from divine inspiration were as they expressed itborne in upon their minds in answer to their earnest petitions in acrisis of difficulty</s>  without entering into an abstruse point ofdivinity one thing is

ratcliffe replied the procuratorfiscal if you think she canguide us the right waybut take heed to what you are aboutyour lifedepends on your behaviour</s> its a sair judgment on a man said ratcliffe when he has ance ganesae far wrang as i hae done that deil a bit he can be honest trytwhilk way he will</s> such was the reflection of ratcliffe when he was left for a few minutesto himself while the retainer of justice went to procure a properwarrant and give the necessary directions</s> the rising moon saw the whole party free from the walls of the city andentering upon the open ground</s>  arthurs seat like a couchant lion ofimmense sizesalisbury crags like a huge belt or girdle of granitewere dimly visible</s>  holding their path along the southern side of thecanongate they gained the abbey of holyrood house and from thence foundtheir way by step and stile into the kings park</s>  they were at first fourin numberan officer of justice and sharpitlaw who were well armed withpistols and cutlasses ratcliffe who was not trusted with weapons lesthe might peradventure have used them on the wrong side and the female</s> but at the last stile when they entered the chase they were joined byother two officers whom sharpitlaw desirous to secure sufficient forcefor his purpose and at the same time to avoid observation had directedto wait for him at this place</s>  ratcliffe saw this accession of strengthwith some disquietude for he had hitherto thought it likely thatrobertson who was a bold stout and active young fellow might havemade his escape from sharpitlaw and the single officer by force oragility without his being implicated in the matter</s>  but the presentstrength of the followers of justice was overpowering and the only modeof saving robertson which the old sinner was well disposed to doproviding always he could accomplish his purpose without compromising hisown safety must be by contriving that he should have some signal oftheir approach</s>  it was probably with this view that ratcliffe hadrequested the addition of madge to the party having considerableconfidence in her propensity to exert her lungs</s>  indeed she had alreadygiven them so many specimens of her clamorous loquacity that sharpitlawhalf determined to send her back with one of the officers rather thancarry forward in his company a person so extremely ill qualified to be aguide in a secret expedition</s>  it seemed too as if the open air theapproach to the hills and the ascent of the moon supposed to be soportentous over those whose brain is infirm made her spirits rise in adegree tenfold more loquacious than she had hitherto exhibited</s>  tosilence her by fair means seemed impossible authoritative commands andcoaxing entreaties she set alike at defiance and threats

while ratcliffe divertedmadges attention declared that though they had a general knowledge ofthe spot they could not undertake to guide the party to it by theuncertain light of the moon with such accuracy as to insure success totheir expedition</s> what shall we do ratcliffe</s>  said sharpitlaw if he sees us before wesee himand thats what he is certain to do if we go strolling aboutwithout keeping the straight roadwe may bid gude day to the job and iwould rather lose one hundred pounds baith for the credit of the policeand because the provost says somebody maun be hanged for this job

excessive indignation of the council of regency atthe slight put upon their authority by the murder of porteous haddictated measures in which their own extreme desire of detecting theactors in that

shouldinform against any person concerned in the deed and the penalty ofdeath by a very unusual and severe enactment was denounced againstthose who should harbour the guilty</s>  but what was chiefly

ministers who shouldrefuse to comply with this injunction were declared for the firstoffence incapable of sitting or voting in any church judicature and forthe second incapable of holding any ecclesiastical preferment inscotland</s> this last order united in a common cause those who might privatelyrejoice in porteouss death though they dared not vindicate the mannerof it with the more scrupulous presbyterians who held that even thepronouncing the name of the lords spiritual in a scottish pulpit wasquodammodo an acknowledgment of prelacy and that the injunction ofthe legislature was

those military fathers of the church to say that while allallowed it was impious to pay the cess employed for maintaining thestanding army and militia there was a fierce controversy on thelawfulness of paying the duties levied at ports and bridges formaintaining roads and other necessary purposes that there were some whorepugnant to these imposts for turnpikes and pontages were neverthelessfree

considerations he hadshifted his ground at different times concerning the degree of freedomwhich he felt in adopting any act of immediate acknowledgment orsubmission to the present government which

has indeed the privilege of remaining silentif he pleases but every man necessarily feels that a refusal to answernatural and pertinent interrogatories put by judicial authority is initself a strong proof of guilt and will certainly lead to his beingcommitted to prison and few can renounce the hope of obtaining libertyby giving some specious account of themselves and showing apparentfrankness in explaining their motives and accounting for their conduct</s> it therefore seldom happens that the prisoner refuses to give ajudicial declaration in which nevertheless either by letting out toomuch of

of edinburgh</s>  at a quarter of a miles distance is a clumsysquare tower the residence of the laird of liberton who in formertimes with the habits of the predatory chivalry of germany is

intercept or prevent if possible</s> the measure was not meant as a harsh or injurious severity on the part ofthe magistrates but in butlers circumstances it pressed cruelly hard</s> he felt he must be suffering under the bad opinion of the person who wasdearest to him from an imputation of unkind desertion the most alien tohis nature</s> this painful thought pressing on a frame already injured brought on asuccession of slow and lingering feverish attacks which greatly impairedhis health and at length rendered him incapable even of the sedentaryduties of the school on which his bread depended</s>  fortunately old mr</s> whackbairn who was the principal teacher of the little parochialestablishment was sincerely attached to butler</s>  besides that he wassensible of his merits and

madgesproposal to rest under the trees by which they were still somewhatscreened until the commencement of service should give them anopportunity of entering the hamlet without attracting a crowd

zeal she began to bedizen and trick herself out withshreds and remnants of beggarly finery which she took out of a littlebundle and which when disposed around her person made her appearanceten times

church</s>  as jeanie had no mind to enter thecongregation in such company she walked aside from the pathway and saidin a decided tone madge i will wait here till the church comesoutyou may go in by

situationshe looked for safety to this forbidden place of assembly as the huntedanimal will sometimes seek shelter from imminent danger in the humanhabitation or in other places of refuge most alien to its nature andhabits</s>  not even the sound of the organ and of one or two flutes whichaccompanied the psalmody prevented her from following her guide into thechancel of the church</s> no sooner had madge put her foot upon the pavement and become sensiblethat she was the object of attention to the spectators than she resumedall the fantastic extravagance of deportment which some transient touchof melancholy had banished for an instant</s>  she swam rather than walked upthe centre aisle dragging jeanie after her whom she held fast by thehand</s>  she would indeed have fain slipped aside into the pew nearest tothe door and left madge to ascend in her own manner and alone to thehigh places of the synagogue but this was impossible without a degreeof violent resistance which seemed to her inconsistent with the time andplace and she was accordingly led in captivity up the whole length ofthe church by her grotesque conductress who with halfshut eyes a primsmile upon her lips and a mincing motion with her hands whichcorresponded with the delicate and affected pace at which she was pleasedto move seemed to take the general stare of the congregation which suchan exhibition

around her and consider to whom she ought toappeal for protection so soon as the service should be concluded</s>  herfirst ideas naturally fixed upon the clergyman and she was confirmed inthe resolution by observing that he was an aged gentleman of a dignifiedappearance and deportment who read the service with an undisturbed anddecent gravity which brought back to becoming attention those youngermembers of the congregation who had been disturbed by the extravagantbehaviour of madge wildfire</s>  to the clergyman therefore jeanie resolvedto make her appeal when the service was over</s> it is true she felt disposed to be shocked at his surplice of which shehad heard so much but which she had never seen upon the person of apreacher of the word</s>  then she was confused by the change of postureadopted in different parts of the ritual the more so as madge wildfireto whom they seemed familiar took the opportunity to exercise authorityover her pulling her up and pushing her down with a bustling assiduitywhich jeanie felt must make them both the objects of painful attention</s> but notwithstanding these prejudices it was her prudent resolution inthis dilemma to imitate as nearly as

fatigue overpowered her and she fell fast asleep inthe other corner of the pew</s> jeanie though her mind in her own despite sometimes reverted to hersituation compelled herself to give attention to a sensible energeticand wellcomposed discourse upon the practical doctrines ofchristianity which she could not help approving although it was everyword written down and read by the preacher and although it was deliveredin a tone and gesture very different from those of boanerges stormheavenwho was her fathers favourite preacher</s>  the serious and placid attentionwith which jeanie listened did not escape the clergyman</s>  madgewildfires entrance had rendered him apprehensive of some disturbance toprovide against which as far as possible he often turned his eyes tothe part of the church where jeanie and she were placed and became soonaware that although the loss of her headgear and the awkwardness ofher situation had given an uncommon and anxious air to the features ofthe former yet she was in a state of mind very different from that ofher companion</s>  when he dismissed the congregation he observed her lookaround with a wild and terrified look as if uncertain what course sheought to adopt and noticed that she approached one or two of the mostdecent of the congregation as if to address them and then shrunk backtimidly on observing that they seemed to shun and to avoid her</s>

parochialofficer seeing as the living mun go as it pleases sir edmund to willit but his reverence has a canny bit land of his own and need not lookon two sides of a penny</s> jeanie could not help comparing the irregular yet extensive andcommodious pile of building before her to the manses in her owncountry where a set of penurious heritors professing all the while thedevotion of their lives

for the like of me sir said jeanie to whom the ideaof a stagecoach was unknown as indeed they were then only used in theneighbourhood of london</s> mr</s>  staunton briefly explained that she would find that mode ofconveyance more commodious cheaper and more safe than travelling onhorseback</s>  she expressed her gratitude with so much singleness of heartthat he was induced to ask her whether

pamphlet from his pocket and began to read</s> jeanie had good sense and tact which constitute betwixt them that whichis called natural good breeding</s>  she interpreted the dukes manoeuvre asa hint that she was to ask no more questions and she remained silentaccordingly</s> the carriage rolled rapidly onwards through fertile meadows ornamentedwith splendid old oaks and catching occasionally a glance of themajestic mirror of a broad and placid river</s>  after passing through apleasant village the equipage stopped on a commanding eminence wherethe beauty of english landscape was displayed in its utmost luxuriance</s> here the duke alighted and desired jeanie to follow him</s>  they paused fora moment on the brow of a hill to gaze on the unrivalled landscape whichit presented</s>  a huge sea of verdure with crossing and intersectingpromontories of massive and tufted groves was tenanted by numberlessflocks and herds which seemed to wander unrestrained and unboundedthrough the rich pastures</s>  the thames here turreted with villas andthere garlanded with forests moved on slowly and placidly like themighty monarch of the scene to whom all its other beauties were butaccessories and bore on its bosom an hundred barks and skiffs whosewhite sails and gaily fluttering pennons gave life to the whole</s> the duke of argyle was of course familiar with this scene but to a manof taste it must be always new</s>  yet as he paused and looked on thisinimitable landscape with the feeling of delight which it must give tothe bosom of every admirer of nature his thoughts naturally reverted tohis own more grand and scarce less beautiful domains of inverary</s> this is a fine scene he said to his companion curious perhaps todraw out her sentiments we have nothing like it in scotland</s> its braw rich feeding for the cows and they have a fine breed ocattle here replied jeanie but i like just as weel to look at thecraigs of arthurs seat and the sea coming in ayont them as at a thaemuckle trees</s> the duke smiled at a reply equally professional and national and made asignal for the carriage to remain where it was</s>  then adopting anunfrequented footpath he conducted jeanie through several complicatedmazes to a posterndoor in a high brick wall</s> it was shut but as the duke tapped slightly at it a person in waitingwithin after reconnoitring through a small iron grate contrived for thepurpose unlocked the door and admitted them</s>  they entered and it wasimmediately closed and fastened behind them</s>  this was all done quicklythe door so instantly closing and the person who opened it so suddenlydisappearing that jeanie could not even catch a glimpse of his exterior</s> they found themselves at the extremity of a deep and narrow alleycarpeted with the most verdant and closeshaven turf which felt likevelvet under their feet and screened from the sun by the branches of thelofty elms which united over the path and caused it to resemble in thesolemn obscurity of the light which they admitted as well as from therange of columnar stems and intricate union of their arched branchesone of the narrow side aisles in an ancient gothic cathedral</s>

feltherself in a place apparently so lonely with a man of such high rank</s> that she should have been permitted to wait on the duke in his own houseand have been there received to a private interview was in itself anuncommon and distinguished event in the annals of a life so simple ashers but to find herself his travelling companion in a journey and thensuddenly to be left alone with him in so secluded a situation hadsomething in it of awful mystery</s>  a romantic heroine might have suspectedand dreaded the power of her own charms but jeanie was too wise to letsuch a silly thought intrude on her mind</s>  still however she had a mosteager desire to know where she now was and to whom she was to bepresented</s> she remarked that the dukes dress though still such as indicated rankand fashion for it was not the custom of men of quality at that time todress themselves like their own coachmen or grooms was neverthelessplainer than that in which she had seen him upon a former occasion andwas divested in particular of all those badges of external decorationwhich intimated superior consequence</s>  in short he was attired as plainlyas any gentleman of fashion could appear in the streets of london in amorning and this circumstance helped to shake an opinion which jeaniebegan to entertain that perhaps he intended she should plead her causein the presence of royalty itself</s>  but surely said she to herselfhe wad hae putten on his braw star and garter an he had thought ocoming before the face of majestyand after a this is mair like agentlemans policy than a royal palace</s> there was some sense in jeanies reasoning yet she was not sufficientlymistress either of the circumstances of etiquette or the particularrelations which existed betwixt the government and the duke of argyle toform an accurate judgment</s>  the duke as we have said was at this time inopen opposition to the administration of sir robert walpole and wasunderstood to be out of favour with the royal family to whom he hadrendered such important services</s>  but it was a maxim of queen caroline tobear herself towards her political friends with such caution as if therewas a possibility of their one day being her enemies and towardspolitical opponents with the same degree of circumspection as if theymight again become friendly to her measures since margaret of anjou noqueenconsort had exercised such weight in the political affairs ofengland and the personal address which she displayed on many occasionshad no small share in reclaiming from their political heresy many ofthose determined tories who after the reign of the stuarts had beenextinguished in the person of queen anne were disposed rather totransfer their allegiance to her brother the chevalier de st</s>  georgethan to acquiesce in the settlement of the crown on the hanover family</s> her husband whose most shining quality was courage in the field ofbattle and who endured the office of king of england without ever beingable to acquire english habits or any familiarity with englishdispositions found the utmost assistance from the address of hispartner and while he jealously affected to do everything according tohis own will and pleasure was in secret prudent enough to take andfollow the advice of his more adroit consort</s>  he intrusted to her thedelicate office of determining the various degrees of favour necessary toattach the wavering or to confirm such as were already friendly or toregain those whose goodwill had been lost</s> with all the winning address of an elegant and according to the timesan accomplished woman queen caroline possessed the masculine soul of theother sex</s>  she was proud by nature and even her policy could not alwaystemper her expressions of displeasure although few were more ready atrepairing any false step of this kind when her prudence came up to theaid of her passions</s>  she loved the real possession of power rather thanthe show of it and whatever she did herself that was either wise orpopular she always desired that the king should have the full credit aswell as the advantage of the measure conscious that by adding to hisrespectability she was most likely to maintain her own</s>  and so desirouswas she to comply with all his tastes that when threatened with thegout she had repeatedly had recourse to checking the fit by the use ofthe cold bath thereby endangering her life that she might be able toattend the king in his walks</s> it was a very consistent part of queen carolines character to keep upmany private correspondences with those to whom in public she seemedunfavourable or who for various reasons stood ill with the court</s>  bythis means she kept in her hands the thread of many a political intrigueand without pledging herself to anything could often prevent discontentfrom becoming hatred and opposition from exaggerating itself intorebellion</s>  if by any accident her correspondence with such personschanced to be observed or discovered which she took all possible painsto prevent it was represented as a mere intercourse of society havingno reference to politics an answer with which even the prime ministersir robert walpole was compelled to remain satisfied when he discoveredthat the queen had given a private audience to pulteney afterwards earlof bath his most formidable and most inveterate enemy</s> in thus maintaining occasional intercourse with several persons whoseemed most alienated from the crown it may readily be supposed thatqueen caroline had taken care not to break entirely with the duke ofargyle</s>  his high birth his great talents the estimation in which he washeld in his own country the great services which he had rendered thehouse of brunswick in 1715 placed him high in that rank of persons whowere not to be rashly neglected</s>  he had almost by his single andunassisted talents stopped the irruption of the banded force of all thehighland chiefs there was little doubt that with the slightestencouragement he could put them all in motion and renew the civil warand it was well known that the most flattering overtures had beentransmitted to the duke from the court of st</s>  germains</s>  the character andtemper of scotland was still little known and it was considered as avolcano which might indeed slumber for a series of years but wasstill liable at a moment the least expected to break out into awasteful irruption</s>  it was therefore of the highest importance toretain come hold over so important a personage as the duke of argyle andcaroline preserved the power of doing so by means of a lady with whomas wife of george ii</s>  she might have been supposed to be on lessintimate terms</s> it was not the least instance of the queens address that she hadcontrived that one of her principal attendants lady suffolk shouldunite in her own person the two apparently inconsistent characters ofher husbands mistress and her own very obsequious and complaisantconfidant</s>  by this dexterous management the queen secured her poweragainst the danger which might most have threatened itthe thwartinginfluence of an ambitious rival and if she submitted to themortification of being obliged to connive at her husbands infidelityshe was at least guarded against what she might think its most dangerouseffects and was besides at liberty now and then to bestow a few civilinsults upon her good howard whom however in general she treatedwith great decorum</s>  see horace walpoles reminiscences</s> lady suffolk lay under strong obligations to the duke of argyle forreasons which may be collected from horace walpoles reminiscences ofthat reign and through her means the duke had some occasionalcorrespondence with queen caroline much interrupted however since thepart he had taken in the debate concerning the porteous mob an affairwhich the queen though somewhat unreasonably was disposed to resentrather as an intended and premeditated insolence to her own person andauthority than as a sudden ebullition of popular vengeance</s>  stillhowever the communication remained open betwixt them though it had beenof late disused on both sides</s>  these remarks will be found necessary tounderstand the scene which is about to be presented to the reader</s> from the narrow alley which they had traversed the duke turned into oneof the same character but broader and still longer</s>  here for the firsttime since they had entered these gardens jeanie saw persons approachingthem</s> they were two ladies one of whom walked a little behind the other yetnot so much as to prevent her from hearing and replying to whateverobservation was addressed to her by the lady who walked foremost andthat without her having the trouble to turn her person</s>  as they advancedvery slowly jeanie had time to study their features and appearance</s>  theduke also slackened his pace as if to give her time to collect herselfand repeatedly desired her not to be afraid</s>  the lady who seemed theprincipal person had remarkably good features though somewhat injured bythe smallpox that venomous scourge which each village esculapiusthanks to jenner can now tame as easily as their tutelary deity subduedthe python</s>  the ladys eyes were brilliant her teeth good and hercountenance formed to express at will either majesty or courtesy</s>  herform though rather embonpoint was nevertheless graceful and theelasticity and firmness of her step gave no room to suspect what wasactually the case that she suffered occasionally from a disorder themost unfavourable to pedestrian exercise</s>  her dress was rather rich thangay and her manner commanding and noble</s> her companion was of lower stature with light brown hair and expressiveblue eyes</s>  her features without being absolutely regular were perhapsmore pleasing than if they had been critically handsome</s>  a melancholy orat least a pensive expression for which her lot gave too much causepredominated when she was silent but gave way to a pleasing andgoodhumoured smile when she spoke to any one</s> when they were within twelve or fifteen yards of these ladies the dukemade a sign that jeanie should stand still and stepping forward himselfwith the grace which was natural to him made a profound obeisance whichwas formally yet in a dignified manner returned by the personage whomhe approached</s> i hope she said with an affable and condescending smile that i seeso great a stranger at court as the duke of argyle has been of late inas good health as his friends there and elsewhere could wish him toenjoy</s> the duke replied that he had been perfectly well and added that thenecessity of attending to the public business before the house as wellas the time occupied by a late journey to scotland had rendered him lessassiduous in paying his duty at the levee and drawingroom than he couldhave desired</s> when your grace can find time for a duty so frivolous replied thequeen you are aware of your title to be well received</s>  i hope myreadiness to comply with the wish which you expressed yesterday to ladysuffolk is a sufficient proof that one of the royal family at leasthas not forgotten ancient and important services in resenting somethingwhich resembles recent neglect</s>  this was said apparently with great goodhumour and in a tone which expressed a desire of conciliation</s> the duke replied that he would account himself the most unfortunate ofmen if he could be supposed capable of neglecting his duty in modes andcircumstances when it was expected and would have been agreeable</s>  he wasdeeply gratified by the honour which her majesty was now doing to himpersonally and he trusted she would soon perceive that it was in amatter essential to his majestys interest that he had the boldness togive her this trouble</s> you cannot oblige me more my lord duke replied the queen than bygiving me the advantage of your lights and experience on any point of thekings service</s>  your grace is aware that i can only be the mediumthrough which the matter is subjected to his majestys superior wisdombut if it is a suit which respects your grace personally it shall loseno support by being preferred through me</s> it is no suit of mine madam replied the duke nor have i any toprefer for myself personally although i feel in full force my obligationto your majesty</s>  it is a business which concerns his majesty as a loverof justice and of mercy and which i am convinced may be highly usefulin conciliating the unfortunate irritation which at present subsistsamong his majestys good subjects in scotland</s> there were two parts of this speech disagreeable to caroline</s>  in thefirst place it removed the flattering notion she had adopted thatargyle designed to use her personal intercession in making his peace withthe administration and recovering the employments of which he had beendeprived and next she was displeased that he should talk of thediscontents in scotland as irritations to be conciliated rather thansuppressed</s> under the influence of these feelings she answered hastily that hismajesty has good subjects in england my lord duke he is bound to thankgod and the lawsthat he has subjects in scotland i think he may thankgod and his sword</s> the duke though a courtier coloured slightly and the queen instantlysensible of her error added without displaying the least change ofcountenance and as if the words had been an original branch of thesentenceand the swords of those real scotchmen who are friends to thehouse of brunswick particularly that of his grace of argyle</s> my sword madam replied the duke like that of my fathers has beenalways at the command of my lawful king and of my native countryitrust it is impossible to separate their real rights and interests</s>  butthe present is a matter of more private concern and respects the personof an obscure individual</s> what is the affair my lord</s>  said the queen</s>  let us find out what weare talking about lest we should misconstrue and misunderstand eachother</s> the matter madam answered the duke of argyle regards the fate of anunfortunate young woman in scotland now lying under sentence of deathfor a crime of which i think it highly probable that she is innocent</s>  andmy humble petition to your majesty is to obtain your powerfulintercession with the king for a pardon</s> it was now the queens turn to colour and she did so over cheek andbrow neck and bosom</s>  she paused a moment as if unwilling to trust hervoice with the first expression of her displeasure and on assuming theair of dignity and an austere regard of control she at length repliedmy lord duke i will not ask your motives for addressing to me arequest which circumstances have rendered such an extraordinary one</s> your road to the kings closet as a peer and a privycouncillorentitled to request an audience was open without giving me the pain ofthis discussion</s>  i at least have had enough of scotch pardons</s> the duke was prepared for this burst of indignation and he was notshaken by it</s>  he did not attempt a reply while the queen was in the firstheat of displeasure but remained in the same firm yet respectfulposture which he had assumed during the interview</s>  the queen trainedfrom her situation to selfcommand instantly perceived the advantage shemight give against herself by yielding to passion and added in the samecondescending and affable tone in which she had opened the interviewyou must allow me some of the privileges of the sex my lord and do notjudge uncharitably of me though i am a little moved at the recollectionof the gross insult and outrage done in your capital city to the royalauthority at the very time when it was vested in my unworthy person</s> your grace cannot be surprised that i should both have felt it at thetime and recollected it now</s> it is certainly a matter not speedily to be forgotten answered theduke</s>  my own poor thoughts of it have been long before your majesty andi must have expressed myself very ill if i did not convey my detestationof the murder which was committed under such extraordinary circumstances</s> i might indeed be so unfortunate as to differ with his majestysadvisers on the degree in which it was either just or politic to punishthe innocent instead of the guilty</s>  but i trust your majesty will permitme to be silent on a topic in which my sentiments have not the goodfortune to coincide with those of more able men</s> we will not prosecute a topic on which we may probably differ said thequeen</s>  one word however i may say in privateyou know our good ladysuffolk is a little deafthe duke of argyle when disposed to renew hisacquaintance with his master and mistress will hardly find many topicson which we should disagree</s> let me hope said the duke bowing profoundly to so flattering anintimation that i shall not be so unfortunate as to have found one onthe present occasion</s> i must first impose on your grace the duty of confession said thequeen before i grant you absolution</s>  what is your particular interestin this young woman</s>  she does not seem and she scanned jeanie as shesaid this with the eye of a connoisseur much qualified to alarm myfriend the duchesss jealousy</s> i think your majesty replied the duke smiling in his turn willallow my taste may be a pledge for me on that score</s> then though she has not much the air dune grande dame i suppose sheis some thirtieth cousin in the terriblechapter of scottish genealogy</s> no madam said the duke but i wish some of my nearer relations hadhalf her worth honesty and affection</s> her name must be campbell at least</s>  said queen caroline</s> no madam her name is not quite so distinguished if i may be permittedto say so answered the duke</s> ah</s>  but she comes from inverary or argyleshire</s>  said the sovereign</s> she has never been farther north in her life than edinburgh madam</s> then my conjectures are all ended said the queen and your grace mustyourself take the trouble to explain the affair of your protegee</s> with that precision and easy brevity which is only acquired by habituallyconversing in the higher ranks of society and which is the diametricalopposite of that protracted style of disquisition   which squires call potter and which men call prosethe duke explained the singular law under which effie deans had receivedsentence of death and detailed the affectionate exertions which jeaniehad made in behalf of a sister for whose sake she was willing tosacrifice all but truth and conscience</s> queen caroline listened with attention she was rather fond it must beremembered of an argument and soon found matter in what the duke toldher for raising difficulties to his request</s> it appears to me my lord she replied that this is a severe law</s>  butstill it is adopted upon good grounds i am bound to suppose as the lawof the country and the girl has been convicted under it</s>  the verypresumptions which the law construes into a positive proof of guilt existin her case and all that your grace has said concerning the possibilityof her innocence may be a very good argument for annulling the act ofparliament but cannot while it stands good be admitted in favour ofany individual convicted upon the statute</s> the duke saw and avoided the snare for he was conscious that byreplying to the argument he must have been inevitably led to adiscussion in the course of which the queen was likely to be hardenedin her own opinion until she became obliged out of mere respect toconsistency to let the criminal suffer</s> illustration jeanie and queen caroline194if your majesty he said would condescend to hear my poorcountrywoman herself perhaps she may find an advocate in your own heartmore able than i am to combat the doubts suggested by yourunderstanding</s> the queen seemed to acquiesce and the duke made a signal for jeanie toadvance from the spot where she had hitherto remained watchingcountenances which were too long accustomed to suppress all apparentsigns of emotion to convey to her any interesting intelligence</s>  hermajesty could not help smiling at the awestruck manner in which thequiet demure figure of the little scotchwoman advanced towards her andyet more at the first sound of her broad northern accent</s>  but jeanie hada voice low and sweetly toned an admirable thing in woman and ekebesought her leddyship to have pity on a poor misguided young creaturein tones so affecting that like the notes of some of her native songsprovincial vulgarity was lost in pathos</s> stand up young woman said the queen but in a kind tone and tell mewhat sort of a barbarous people your countryfolk are where childmurderis become so common as to require the restraint of laws like yours</s> if your leddyship pleases answered jeanie there are mony placesbesides scotland where mothers are unkind to their ain flesh and blood</s> it must be observed that the disputes between george the second andfrederick prince of wales were then at the highest and that thegoodnatured part of the public laid the blame on the queen</s>  she colouredhighly and darted a glance of a most penetrating character first atjeanie and then at the duke</s>  both sustained it unmoved jeanie fromtotal unconsciousness of the offence she had given and the duke from hishabitual composure</s>  but in his heart he thought my unlucky protegeehas with this luckless answer shot dead by a kind of chancemedley heronly hope of success</s> lady suffolk goodhumouredly and skilfully interposed in this awkwardcrisis</s>  you should tell this lady she said to jeanie the

conversation and for breaking theseventh command</s>  here she raised her eyes to the duke saw his hand athis chin and totally unconscious of what she had said out of jointgave double effect to the innuendo by stopping short and lookingembarrassed</s> as for lady suffolk she retired like a covering party which havinginterposed betwixt their retreating friends and the enemy have suddenlydrawn on themselves a fire unexpectedly severe</s> the deuce take the lass thought the duke of argyle to himself theregoes another shotand she has hit with both barrels right and left</s> indeed the duke had himself his share of the confusion for having actedas master of ceremonies to this innocent offender he felt much in thecircumstances of a country squire who having introduced his spanielinto a wellappointed drawingroom is doomed to witness the disorder anddamage which arises to china and to dressgowns in consequence of itsuntimely frolics</s>  jeanies last chancehit however obliterated the illimpression which had arisen from the first for her majesty had not solost the feelings of a wife in those of a queen but that she could enjoya jest at the expense of her good suffolk</s>  she turned towards the dukeof argyle with a smile which marked that she enjoyed the triumph andobserved the scotch are a rigidly moral people</s>  then again applyingherself to jeanie she asked how she travelled up from scotland</s> upon my foot mostly madam was the reply</s> what all that immense way upon foot</s> how far can you walk in a day</s> fiveandtwenty miles and a bittock</s> and a

and i didna just athegither walk the haill way neither for i hadwhiles the cast of a cart and i had the cast of a horse fromferrybridgeand divers other easements said jeanie cutting short herstory for she observed the duke made the sign he had fixed upon</s> with all these accommodations answered the queen you must have had avery fatiguing journey and i fear to little purpose since if theking were

was wrong</s>  the shoals on which jeanie had touched in this delicateconversation lay under ground and were unknown to her this rock wasabove water and she avoided it</s> she was confident she said

hearing of the cries but had no sooner entered the streets ofcarlisle than archibald at jeanies earnest and urgent entreaty wentto a magistrate to state the cruelty which was likely to be exercised onthis unhappy creature</s> in about an hour and a half he returned and reported to jeanie that themagistrate had very readily gone in person with some assistance to therescue of the unfortunate woman

a voice no longer overstrained by falsespirits but softened saddened and subdued by bodily exhaustion</s>  shewas still insane but was no longer able to express her wandering ideasin the wild notes of her former state of exalted imagination</s>  there wasdeath in the plaintive tones of her voice which yet in this moderatedand melancholy mood had something of the lulling sound with which amother

country matterswith jeanie deans during their return from richmond had impressed himwith a belief that the father whose experience and success she sofrequently quoted must be exactly the sort of person whom he wanted</s> when the condition annexed to effies pardon rendered it highly probablethat david deans would choose to change his place of residence this ideaagain occurred to the duke more strongly and as he was an enthusiastequally in agriculture and in benevolence he imagined he was serving thepurposes of both when he wrote to the gentleman in edinburgh entrustedwith his affairs to inquire into the character of david deanscowfeeder and so forth at st</s>  leonards crags and if he found him suchas he had been represented to engage him without delay and on the mostliberal terms to superintend his fancyfarm in dumbartonshire</s> the proposal was made to old david by the gentleman so commissioned onthe second day after his daughters pardon had reached edinburgh</s>  hisresolution to leave st</s>  leonards had been already formed the honour ofan express invitation from the duke of argyle to superintend a departmentwhere so much skill and diligence was required was in itself extremelyflattering and the more so because honest david who was not without anexeellent opinion of his own talents persuaded himself that byaccepting this charge he would in some sort repay the great favour hehad received at the hands of the argyle family</s>  the appointmentsincluding the right of sufficient grazing for a small stock of his ownwere amply liberal and davids keen eye saw that the situation wasconvenient for trafficking to advantage in highland cattle</s>  there wasrisk of hership from the neighbouring mountains indeed but theawful name of the duke of argyle would be a great security and a trifleof blackmail would david was aware assure his safety</s>  hership a scottish word which may be said to be now obsoletebecause fortunately the practice of plundering by armed force whichis its meaning does not require to be commonly spoken of</s> still however there were two points on which he haggled</s>  the first wasthe character of the clergyman with whose worship he was to join and onthis delicate point he received as we will presently show the readerperfect satisfaction</s>  the next obstacle was the condition of his youngestdaughter obliged as she was to leave scotland for so many years</s> the gentleman of the law smiled and said there was no occasion tointerpret that clause very strictlythat if the young woman leftscotland for a few months or even weeks and came to her fathers newresidence by sea from the western side of england nobody would know ofher arrival or at least nobody who had either the right or inclinationto give her disturbance</s>  the extensive heritable jurisdictions of hisgrace excluded the interference of other magistrates with those living onhis estates and they who were in immediate dependence on him wouldreceive orders to give the young woman no disturbance</s>  living on theverge of the highlands she might indeed be said to be out of scotlandthat is beyond the bounds of ordinary law and civilisation</s> old deans was not quite satisfied with this reasoning but the elopementof effie which took place on the third night after her liberationrendered his residence at st</s>  leonards so detestable to him that heclosed at once with the proposal which had been made him and enteredwith pleasure into the idea of surprising jeanie as had been proposed bythe duke to render the change of residence more striking to her</s>  theduke had apprised archibald of these circumstances with orders to actaccording to the instructions he should receive from edinburgh and bywhich accordingly he was directed to bring jeanie to roseneath</s> the father and daughter communicated these matters to each other nowstopping now walking slowly towards the lodge which showed itself amongthe trees at about halfamiles distance from the little bay in whichthey had landed</s>  as they approached the house david deans informed hisdaughter with somewhat like a grim smile which was the utmost advancehe ever made towards a mirthful expression of visage that there wasbaith a worshipful gentleman and ane reverend gentleman residingtherein</s>  the worshipful gentleman was his honour the laird ofknocktarlitie who was bailie of the lordship under the duke of argyleane highland gentleman tarrd wi the same stick david doubted asmony of them namely a hasty and choleric temper and a neglect of thehigher things that belong to salvation and also a gripping unto thethings of this world without muckle distinction of property buthowever ane gude hospitable gentleman with whom it would be a part ofwisdom to live on a gude

for jeanie deans by the rod ofthe same benevolent enchanter whose power had transplanted her fatherfrom the crags of st</s>  leonards to the banks of the gare loch</s>  the dukeof argyle was not a person to forget the hereditary debt of gratitudewhich had been bequeathed to him by his grandfather in favour of thegrandson of old bible butler</s>  he had internally resolved to provide forreuben butler in this kirk of knocktarlitie of which the incumbent hadjust departed this life</s>  accordingly his agent received the necessaryinstructions for that purpose under the qualifying condition alwaysthat the learning and character of mr</s>  butler should be found proper forthe charge</s>  upon inquiry these were found as highly satisfactory as hadbeen reported in the case of david deans himself</s> by this preferment the duke of argyle more essentially benefited hisfriend and protegee jeanie than he himself was aware of since hecontributed to remove objections in her fathers mind to the match whichhe had no idea had been in existence</s> we have already noticed that deans had something of a prejudice againstbutler which was perhaps in some degree owing to his possessing a sortof consciousness that the poor usher looked with eyes of affection uponhis eldest daughter</s>  this in davids eyes was a sin of presumptioneven although it should not be followed by any overt act or actualproposal</s>  but the lively interest which butler had displayed in hisdistresses since jeanie set forth on her london expedition and whichtherefore he ascribed to personal respect for himself individually hadgreatly softened the feelings of irritability with which david hadsometimes regarded him</s>  and while he was in this good dispositiontowards butler another incident took place which had great influence onthe old mans mind</s>  so soon as the shock of effies second elopement wasover it was deanss early care to collect and refund to the laird ofdumbiedikes the money which he had lent for effies trial and forjeanies travelling expenses</s>  the laird the pony the cocked hat andthe tabaccopipe had not been seen at st</s>  leonards crags for many aday so that in order to pay

and replacing them with others alteringrepairing scrubbing painting and whitewashing</s>  there was no knowingthe old house which had been so long the mansion of sloth and silence</s> the laird himself seemed in some confusion and his reception thoughkind lacked something of the reverential cordiality with which he usedto greet david deans</s>  there was a change also david did not very

toset off anew for edinburgh so that old may hettly declared that athis was to end with the master just walking himself aff his feet</s> when the business respecting the farm had been talked over and

various speculations to which this wonderful piece ofintelligence gave rise</s>  honest david had now like other great men to goto work to reconcile his speculative principles with existingcircumstances and like other great men when they set seriously aboutthat task he was tolerably successful</s> ought reuben butler in conscience to accept of this preferment in thekirk of scotland subject as david at present thought that establishmentwas to the erastian encroachments of the civil power</s>  this was theleading question and he considered it carefully</s>  the kirk of scotlandwas shorn of its beams and deprived of its full artillery and banners ofauthority but still it contained zealous and fructifying pastorsattentive congregations and with all her spots and blemishes the likeof this kirk was nowhere else to be seen upon earth</s> davids doubts had been too many and too critical to permit him everunequivocally to unite himself with any of the dissenters

oflaypatronage which david deans had ever maintained to be a coming in bythe window and over the wall a cheating and starving the souls of awhole parish for the purpose of clothing the back and filling the bellyof the incumbent</s> this presentation therefore from the duke of argyle whatever was theworth and high character of that nobleman was a limb of the brazenimage a portion of the evil thing and with no kind of consistency coulddavid bend his mind to favour such a transaction</s>  but if the parishionersthemselves joined in a general call to reuben butler to be their pastorit did not seem quite so evident that the existence of this unhappypresentation was a reason for his refusing them the comforts of hisdoctrine</s>  if the presbytery admitted him to the kirk in virtue rather ofthat act of patronage than of the general call of the congregation thatmight be their error and david allowed it was a heavy one</s>  but if reubenbutler accepted of the cure as tendered to him by those whom he wascalled to teach and who had expressed themselves desirous to learndavid after considering and reconsidering the matter came through thegreat virtue of if to be of opinion that he might safely so act in thatmatter</s> there remained a third stumblingblockthe oaths to government exactedfrom the established clergymen in which they acknowledge an erastianking and parliament and homologate the incorporating union betweenengland and scotland through which the latter kingdom had become partand portion of the former wherein prelacy the sister of popery hadmade fast her throne and elevated the horns of her mitre</s>  these weresymptoms of defection which had often made david cry out my bowelsmybowels</s> i am pained at the very heart</s>  and he remembered that a godlybowhead matron had been carried out of the tolbooth church in a swoonbeyond the reach of brandy and burnt feathers merely on hearing thesefearful words it is enacted by the lords spiritual and

on the presentrevolution model with much more impartiality to butler than he had beenable to place them before his own view</s>  and he concluded that his youngfriend ought to think upon these things

david had finished his very long harangue which was onlyinterrupted by monosyllables or little more on the part of butler theorator himself was greatly astonished to find that the conclusion atwhich he very naturally wished to arrive seemed much less decisivelyattained than when he had argued the case in his own mind</s> in this particular davids current of thinking and speaking onlyillustrated

matter of the oathsthey agreed it was time enough to dispute about whenever the shibbolethshould be tendered</s> many arrangements were adopted that evening which were afterwardsripened by correspondence with the duke of argyles man of business whointrusted deans and butler with the benevolent wish of his principalthat they should all meet with jeanie on her return from england at thedukes huntinglodge in roseneath</s> this retrospect so far as the placid loves of jeanie deans and reubenbutler are concerned forms a full explanation of the preceding narrativeup to their meeting

thine</s>         logan</s> the meeting of jeanie and butler under circumstances promising to crownan affection so long delayed was rather affecting from its simplesincerity than from its uncommon vehemence of feeling</s>  david deans whosepractice was sometimes a little different from his theory appalled themat first by giving them the opinion of sundry of the suffering preachersand champions of his younger days that marriage though honourable bythe laws of scripture was yet a state overrashly coveted by professorsand specially by young ministers whose desire he said was at whilestoo inordinate for kirks stipends and wives which had frequentlyoccasioned overready compliance with the general defections of thetimes</s>  he endeavoured to make them aware also that hasty wedlock

peden cameron and renwick had less delight in tyingthe bonds of matrimony than in any other piece of their ministerial workand although they would neither dissuade the parties nor refuse theiroffice they considered the being called to it as an evidence ofindifference on the part of those between whom it was solemnised to themany grievous things of the day</s>  notwithstanding however that marriagewas a snare unto many david was of opinion as indeed he had showed inhis practice that it was in itself honourable especially if times weresuch that honest men could be secure against being shot hanged orbanished and had ane competent livelihood to maintain themselves andthose that might come after them</s>  and therefore as he concludedsomething abruptly addressing jeanie and butler who with faces ashighcoloured as crimson had been listening to his lengthened argumentfor and against the holy state of matrimony i will leave you to yourain cracks</s> as their private conversation however interesting to themselves mightprobably be very little so to the reader so far as it respected theirpresent feelings and future prospects we shall pass it over and onlymention the information which jeanie received from butler concerning hersisters elopement which contained many particulars that she had beenunable to extract from her father</s> jeanie learned therefore that for three days after her pardon hadarrived effie had been the inmate of her fathers house at st</s> leonardsthat the interviews betwixt david and his erring child whichhad taken place before she was liberated from prison had been touchingin the extreme but butler could not suppress his opinion that when hewas freed from the apprehension of losing her in a manner so horribleher father had tightened the bands of discipline so as in some degreeto gall the feelings and aggravate the irritability of a spiritnaturally impatient and petulant and now doubly so from the sense ofmerited disgrace</s> on the third night effie disappeared from st</s>  leonards leaving nointimation whatever of the route she had taken</s>  butler however set outin pursuit of her and with much trouble traced her towards a

distance from thelodge and although the tide did not admit of the large boat coming quiteclose to the jetty of loose stones which served as a pier jeanie whowas both bold and active easily sprung ashore but mrs</s>  dollypositively refusing to commit herself to the same risk the complaisantmr</s>  archibald ordered the boat round to a more regular landingplace ata considerable distance along the shore</s>  he then prepared to landhimself that he might in the meanwhile accompany jeanie to the lodge</s> but as there was no mistaking the woodland lane which led from thence tothe shore and as the moonlight showed her one of the white chimneysrising out of the wood which embosomed the building jeanie declined thisfavour with thanks and requested him to proceed with mrs</s>  dolly whobeing in a country where the ways were so strange to her had mair needof countenance</s> this indeed was a fortunate circumstance and might even be said tosave poor cowslips life if it was true as she herself used solemnly toaver that she must positively have expired for fear if she had beenleft alone in the boat with six wild highlanders in kilts</s> the night was so exquisitely beautiful that jeanie instead ofimmediately directing her course towards the lodge stood looking afterthe boat as it again put off from the side and rowed into the littlebay the dark figures of her companions

1745 the peace of the country adjacent to the highlandswas considerably disturbed</s>  marauders or men that had been driven tothat desperate mode of life quartered themselves in the fastnessesnearest to the lowlands which were their scene of plunder and there isscarce a glen in the romantic and now peaceable highlands of perthstirling and dumbartonshire where one or more did not take up theirresidence</s> the prime pest of the parish of knocktarlitie was a certain donacha dhuna dunaigh or black duncan the mischievous whom we have alreadycasually mentioned</s>  this fellow had been originally a tinkler orcaird many of whom stroll about these districts but when all policewas disorganised by the civil war he threw up his profession and fromhalf thief became whole robber and being generally at the head of threeor four active young fellows and he himself artful bold and wellacquainted with the passes he plied his new profession with emolument tohimself and infinite plague to the country</s> all were convinced that duncan of knock could have put down his namesakedonacha any morning he had a mind for there were in the parish a set ofstout young men who had joined argyles banner in the war under his oldfriend and behaved very well on several occasions</s>  and as for theirleader as no one doubted his courage it was generally supposed thatdonacha had found out the mode of conciliating his favour a thing notvery uncommon in that age and country</s>  this was the more readilybelieved as david deanss cattle being the property of the duke wereleft untouched when the ministers cows were carried off by the thieves</s> another attempt was made to renew the same act of rapine and the cattlewere in the act of being driven off when butler laying his professionaside in a case of such necessity put himself at the head of some of hisneighbours and rescued the creagh an exploit at which deans attended inperson notwithstanding his extreme old age mounted on a highland ponyand girded with an old broadsword likening himself for he failed not toarrogate the whole merit of the expedition to david the son of jessewhen he recovered the spoil of ziklag from the amalekites</s>  this spiritedbehaviour had so far a good effect that donacha dhu na dunaigh kept hisdistance for some time to come and though his distant exploits werefrequently spoken of he did not exercise any depredations in that partof the country</s>
 he continued to flourish and to be heard ofoccasionally until the year 1751 when if the fear of the second davidhad kept him in check fate released him from that restraint for thevenerable patriarch of st</s>  leonards was that year gathered to hisfathers</s> david deans died full of years and of honour</s>

him with a peculiar austerity ofcountenance that if he liked to try such a prank there was one at hiselbow and it required the interference of butler to preserve the peace</s> he expired in the arms of his beloved daughter thankful for all theblessings which providence had vouchsafed to him while in this valley ofstrife and toiland thankful also for the trials he had been visitedwith having found them he said needful to mortify that spiritual prideand confidence in his own gifts which was the side on which the wilyenemy did most sorely beset him</s>  he prayed in the most affecting mannerfor jeanie her husband and her family and that her affectionate dutyto the puir auld man might purchase her length of days here andhappiness hereafter then in a pathetic petition too well understood bythose who knew his family circumstances he besought the shepherd ofsouls while gathering his flock not to forget the little one that hadstrayed from the fold and even then might be in the hands of theravening wolf</s> he prayed for the national jerusalem that peace might bein her land and prosperity in her palacesfor the welfare of thehonourable house of argyle and for the conversion of duncan ofknockdunder</s>  after this he was silent being exhausted nor did he againutter anything distinctly</s>  he was heard indeed to mutter somethingabout national defections righthand extremes and lefthand failingsoff but as may hettly observed his head was carried at the time andit is probable that these expressions occurred to him merely out ofgeneral habit and that he died in the full spirit

timebetween mrs</s>  dolly dutton now mrs</s>  maccorkindale and her formerfriends</s> jeanie took the subject of contention out of the childs hand to satisfyherself of the propriety of her studies but how much was she struck whenshe read upon the title of the broadsidesheet the last speechconfession and dying words of margaret maccraw or murdockson executedon harabee hill near carlisle the day of 1737</s>  it was indeed oneof those papers which archibald had bought at longtown when hemonopolised the pedlars stock which dolly had thrust into her trunk outof sheer economy</s>  one or two copies it seems had remained in herrepositories at inverary till she chanced to need them in packing acheese which as a very superior production was sent in the way ofcivil challenge to the dairy at knocktarlitie</s> the title of this paper so strangely fallen into the very hands fromwhich in wellmeant respect to her feelings it had been so longdetained was of itself sufficiently startling but the narrative itselfwas so interesting that jeanie shaking herself loose from the childrenran upstairs to her own apartment and bolted the door to peruse itwithout interruption</s> the narrative which appeared to have been drawn up or at leastcorrected by the clergyman who attended this unhappy woman stated thecrime for which she suffered to have been her active part in thatatrocious robbery and murder committed near two years since nearhaltwhistle for which the notorious frank levitt was committed for trialat lancaster assizes</s>  it was supposed the evidence of the accomplicethomas tuck commonly called tyburn tom upon which the woman had beenconvicted would weigh equally heavy against him although many wereinclined to think it was tuck himself who had struck the fatal blowaccording to the dying statement of meg murdockson</s> after a circumstantial account of the crime for which she suffered therewas a brief sketch of margarets life</s>  it was stated that she was ascotchwoman by birth and married a soldier in the cameronianregimentthat she long followed the camp and had doubtless acquired infields of battle and similar scenes that ferocity and love of plunderfor which she had been afterwards distinguishedthat her husbandhaving obtained his discharge became servant to a beneficed clergymanof high situation and character in lincolnshire and that she acquiredthe confidence and esteem of that honourable family</s>  she had lost thismany years after her husbands death it was stated in consequence ofconniving at the irregularities of her daughter with the heir of thefamily added to the suspicious circumstances attending the birth of achild which was strongly suspected to have met with foul play in orderto preserve if possible the girls reputation</s>  after this she had leda wandering life both in england and scotland under colour sometimes oftelling fortunes sometimes of driving a trade in smuggled wares butin fact receiving stolen goods and occasionally actively joining inthe exploits by which they were obtained</s>  many of her crimes she hadboasted of after conviction and there was one circumstance for whichshe seemed to feel a mixture

infant in her mad fits and that she gave thefather to understand so but afterwards learned that a female strollerhad got it from her</s>  she showed some compunction at having separatedmother and child especially as the mother had nearly suffered deathbeing condemned on the scotch law for the supposed murder of herinfant</s>  when it was asked what possible interest she could have had inexposing the unfortunate girl to suffer for a crime she had notcommitted she asked if they thought she was going to put her owndaughter into trouble to save another</s>  she did not know what the scotchlaw would have done to her for carrying the child away</s>  this answer wasby no means satisfactory to the clergyman and he discovered by closeexamination that she had a deep and revengeful hatred against the youngperson whom she had thus injured</s>  but the paper intimated that whateverbesides she had communicated upon this subject was confided by her inprivate to the worthy and reverend archdeacon who had bestowed suchparticular pains in affording her spiritual assistance</s>  the broadsidewent on to intimate that after her execution of which the particularswere given her

hand when in possession ofher reason but there was a darkness on the subject and what might havehappened in a moment of insanity was dreadful to think upon</s>  besideswhatever was their own conviction they had no means of establishingeffies innocence to the world which according to the tenor of thisfugitive publication was now at length completely manifested by thedying confession of the person chiefly interested in concealing it</s> after thanking god for a discovery so dear to her feelings mrs</s>  butlerbegan to consider what use she should make of it</s>  to have shown it to herhusband would have been her first impulse but besides that he wasabsent from home and the matter too delicate to be the subject ofcorrespondence by an indifferent penwoman mrs</s>  butler recollected thathe was not possessed of the information necessary to form a judgment uponthe occasion and that adhering to the rule which she had considered asmost advisable she had best transmit the

who love nature always desire to penetrate intoits utmost recesses and lady staunton asked david whether there was notsome mode of gaining a view of the abyss at the foot of the fall</s>  he saidthat he knew a station on a shelf on the farther side of the interceptingrock from which the whole waterfall was visible but that the road to itwas steep and slippery and dangerous</s>  bent however on

was scarce better cladthan the younger</s>  he had on a loose lowland greatcoat and ragged tartantrews or pantaloons</s>  all around looked singularly wild and unpropitious</s> beneath the brow of the

anotherladder from the corner of the cavern if it could be termed so adjustedit against the transverse rock which served as a roof and made signsfor the lady to ascend it while he held it fast

connection so much better than heexpected that if it should be necessary to acknowledge it inconsequence of the recovery of his son it would sound well enough thatlady staunton had a sister who in the decayed state of the family hadmarried a scottish clergyman high in the opinion of his countrymen anda leader in the church</s> it was with these feelings that when the lord high commissionerscompany broke up sir george staunton under pretence of prolonging someinquiries concerning the constitution of the church of scotlandrequested butler to go home to his lodgings in the lawnmarket and drinka

could be much difficulty in removing hiswifes connections to the rectory of willingham it was only on his partprocuring some still better preferment for the present incumbent and onbutlers that he should take orders according to the english church towhich he could not conceive a possibility of his making objection andthen he had them residing under his wing</s>  no doubt there was pain inseeing

think of anenglish living of twelve hundred pounds yearly with the burden ofaffording his company now and then to a neighbour whose health was notstrong or his spirits equal</s>  he might meet he said

have heard of it but i neversaw it before</s> it is common sense replied butler which accords with philosophy andreligion more frequently than pedants or zealots are apt to admit</s> sir george turned the subject and did not again resume it</s>  although theytravelled in sir georges chariot he seemed so much fatigued with themotion that it was necessary for him to remain for a day at a small

very soon after their leaving edinburgh butthe messenger had missed the travellers by passing through midcalder inthe night and overshot his errand by getting to roseneath before them</s> he was now on his return after having waited more than fourandtwentyhours</s>  sir george staunton instantly wrote back an answer and rewardingthe messenger liberally desired him not to sleep till he placed it inhis agents hands</s> at length they embarked in the boat which had waited for them some time</s> during their voyage which was slow for they were obliged to row thewhole way and often against the tide sir george stauntons inquiriesran chiefly on the subject of the highland banditti who had infested thatcountry since the year 1745</s>  butler informed him that many of them werenot native highlanders but gipsies tinkers and other men of desperatefortunes who had taken advantage of the confusion introduced by thecivil war the general discontent of the mountaineers and the unsettledstate of police to practise their plundering trade with more audacity</s> sir george next inquired into their lives their habits whether theviolences which they committed were not sometimes atoned for by acts ofgenerosity and whether they did not possess the virtues as well as thevices of savage tribes</s> butler answered that certainly they did sometimes show sparks ofgenerosity of which even the worst class of malefactors are seldomutterly divested but that their evil propensities were certain andregular principles of action while any occasional burst of virtuousfeeling was only a transient impulse not to be reckoned upon and excitedprobably by some singular and unusual concatenation of circumstances</s>  indiscussing these inquiries which sir george pursued with an apparenteagerness

conveyedparticular interest to his ear</s>  he made the most minute inquiriesconcerning the man whom he mentioned the number of his gang and eventhe appearance of those who belonged to it</s>  upon these points butlercould give little answer</s>  the man had a name among the lower class buthis exploits were considerably exaggerated he had always one or twofellows with him but never aspired to

grave subjects to which the solemnity of theapproaching storm naturally led them their voyage threatened to be moretedious than they expected for gusts of wind which rose and fell withsudden impetuosity swept the bosom of the firth and impeded the effortsof the rowers</s>  they had now only to double a small headland in order toget to the proper landingplace in the mouth of the little river but inthe state of the weather and the boat being heavy this was like to be awork of time and in the meanwhile they must necessarily be exposed tothe storm</s> could we not land on this side of the headland asked sir george andso gain some shelter</s> butler knew of no landingplace at least none affording a convenient oreven practicable passage up the rocks which surrounded the shore</s>

when the disorder happened the magistrates and other persons concernedin the management of the town seemed to be all struck of a heap andwhether from the great terror that had seized all the inhabitants theythought ane immediate enquiry would be fruitless or whether being adirect insult upon the prerogative of the crown they did not care rashlyto intermeddle but no proceedings was had by them</s>  only soon after aneexpress was sent to his majesties solicitor who came to town as soon aswas possible for him but in the meantime the persons who had been mostguilty had either ran off or at least kept themselves upon the winguntil they should see what steps were taken by the government</s> when the solicitor arrived he perceived the whole inhabitants under aconsternation</s>  he had no materials furnished him nay the inhabitantswere so much afraid of being reputed informers that very few people hadso much as the courage to speak with him on the streets</s>  however havingreceived her majesties orders by a letter from the duke of new castlehe resolved to sett about the matter in earnest and entered upon aneenquiry gropeing in the dark</s>  he had no assistance from the magistratesworth mentioning but called witness after witness in the privatestmanner before himself in his own house and for six weeks time frommorning to evening went on in the enquiry without taking the leastdiversion or turning his thoughts to any other business</s> he tried at first what he could do by declarations by engaging secresyso that those who told the truth should never be discovered

those who appearedand knew anything of the matter were under the utmost terror lest itshould take air that they had mentioned any one man as guilty</s> during the course of the enquiry the run of the town which was strongfor the villanous actors begun to alter a little and when they saw thekings servants in earnest to do their best the generality who beforehad spoke very warmly in defence of the wickedness began to be silentand at that period more of the criminals began to abscond</s> at length the enquiry began to open a little and the sollicitor wasunder some difficulty how to proceed</s>  he very well saw that the firstwarrand that was issued out would start the whole gang and as he had notcome at any of the most notorious offenders he was unwilling upon theslight evidence he had to begin</s>  however upon notice given him bygenerall moyle that one king a butcher in the canongate had boastedin presence of bridget knell a soldiers wife the morning after captainporteus was hanged

whom hehad any information</s>  by a signed declaration william stirlingapprentice to james stirling merchant in edinburgh was charged ashaveing been at the netherbow after the gates were shutt with

truth was there were veryfew in whom he could repose confidence</s>  but he was indeed faithfullyserved by one webster a soldier in the welsh fuzileers recommended himby lieutenant alshton who with very great address informed himselfand really run some risque in getting his information concerning theplaces where the persons informed against used to haunt and how theymight be seized</s>  in consequence of which a party of the guard from thecanongate was agreed on to march up at a certain hour when a messageshould be sent</s>  the sollicitor wrote a letter and gave it to one of thetown officers ordered to attend captain maitland one of the towncaptains promoted to that command since the unhappy accident whoindeed was extremely diligent and active throughout the whole andhaveing got

thattime forward the insolence was succeeded by fear</s> stirling and braidwood were immediately sent to the castle andimprisoned</s>  that same night stoddart the smith was seized and he wascommitted to the castle also as was likewise traill the journeymanwright who were all severally examined and denyed the least accession</s> in the meantime the enquiry was going on and it haveing cast up in oneof the declarations that a humpd backed creature marched with a gun asone of the guards to porteus when he went up to the lawn markett theperson who emitted this declaration was employed to walk the streets tosee if he could find him out at last he came to the sollicitor and toldhim he had found him and that he was in a certain house</s>  whereupon awarrand was issued out against him and he was apprehended and sent tothe castle and he proved to be one birnie a helper to the countess ofweemyss coachman</s> thereafter ane information was given in against william mlauchlanffootman to the said countess he haveing been very active in the mobffor sometime he kept himself out of the way but at last he wasapprehended and likewise committed to the castle</s> and these were all the prisoners who were putt under confinement in thatplace</s> there were other persons imprisoned in the tolbooth of edinburgh andseveralls against whom warrands were issued but could not beapprehended whose names and cases shall afterwards be more particularlytaken notice of</s> the ffriends of stirling made an application to the earl of islay lordjusticegenerall setting furth that he was seized with a bloody ffluxthat his life was in danger and that upon ane examination of witnesseswhose names were given in it would appear to conviction that he had notthe least access to any of the riotous proceedings of that wicked mob</s> this petition was by his lordship putt in the hands of his majestiessollicitor who examined the witnesses and by their testimonies itappeared that the young man who was not above eighteen years of agewas that night in company with about half a dozen companions in a publichouse in stephen laws closs near the back of the guard where they allremained untill the noise came to the house that the mob had shut thegates and seized the guard upon which the company broke up and he andone of his companions went towards his masters house and in thecourse of the after examination there was a witness who declared nayindeed swore for the sollicitor by this time saw it necessary to putthose he examined upon oath that he met him stirling after he enteredinto the alley where his master lives going towards his house andanother witness fellowprentice with stirling declares that after themob had seized the guard he went home where he found stirling beforehim and that his master lockt the door and kept them both at home tillafter twelve at night upon weighing of which testimonies and uponconsideration had that he was charged by the declaration only of oneperson who really did not appear to be a witness of the greatest weightand that his life was in danger from the imprisonment he was admitted tobaill by the lord justicegenerall by whose warrand he was committed</s> braidwoods friends applyed in the same manner but as he stood chargedby more than one witness he was not releasedtho indeed thewitnesses adduced for him say somewhat in his exculpationthat he doesnot seem to have been upon any original concert and one of the witnessessays he was along with him at the tolbooth door and refuses what is saidagainst him with regard to his having advised the burning of thetolbooth door</s>  but he remains still in prison</s> as to traill the journeyman wright he is charged by the same witnesswho declared against stirling and there is none concurrs with him andto say the truth concerning him he seemed to be the most ingenuous ofany of them whom the solicitor examined and pointed out a witness bywhom one of the first accomplices was discovered and who escaped whenthe warrand was to be putt in execution against them</s>  he positively denyshis having shutt the gate and tis thought traill ought to be admittedto baill</s> as to birnie he is charged only by one witness who had never seen himbefore nor knew his name so tho i dare say the witness honestlymentioned him tis possible he may be mistaken and in the examinationof above 200 witnesses there is no body concurrs with him and he is aneinsignificant little creature</s> with regard to mlauchlan the proof is strong against him by onewitness that he acted as a serjeant or sort of commander for sometime of a guard that stood cross between the upper end of theluckenbooths and the north side of the street to stop all but friendsfrom going towards the tolbooth and by other witnesses that he was atthe tolbooth door with a link in his hand while the operation of beatingand burning it was going on that he went along with the mob with ahalbert in his hand untill he came to the gallows stone in thegrassmarket and that he stuck the halbert into the hole of the gallowsstone that afterwards he went in amongst the mob when captain porteuswas carried to the dyers tree so that the proof seems very heavyagainst him</s> to sum up this matter with regard to the prisoners in the castle tisbelieved there is strong proof against mlauchlan there is also proofagainst braidwood</s>  but as it consists only in emission of words said tohave been had by him while at the tolbooth door and that he is aneinsignificant pitifull creature and will find people to swear heartilyin his favours tis at best doubtfull whether a jury will be got tocondemn him</s> as to those in the tolbooth of edinburgh john crawford who had forsome time been employed to ring the bells in the steeple of the newchurch of edinburgh being in company with a soldier accidentally thediscourse falling in concerning the captain porteus and his murder as heappears to be a lightheaded fellow he said that he knew people thatwere more guilty than any that were putt in prison</s>  upon thisinformation crawford was seized and being examined it appeared thatwhen the mob begun as he was comeing down from the steeple the mob tookthe keys from him that he was that night in several corners and didindeed delate severall persons whom he saw there and immediatelywarrands were despatched and it was found they had absconded and fled</s> but there was no evidence against him of any kind</s>  nay on the contraryit appeared that he had been with the magistrates in clerks thevintners relating to them what he had seen in the streets</s>  thereforeafter haveing detained him in prison ffor a very considerable time hismajesties advocate and sollicitor signed a warrand for his liberation</s> there was also one james wilson incarcerated in the said tolbooth uponthe declaration of one witness who said he saw him on the streets with agun and there he remained for some time in order to try if a concurringwitness could be found or that he acted any part in the tragedy andwickedness</s>  but nothing farther appeared against him and being seizedwith a severe sickness he is by a warrand signed by his majestiesadvocate and sollicitor liberated upon giveing sufficient baill</s> as to king enquiry was made and the ffact comes out beyond allexception that he was in the lodge at the netherbow with lindsay thewaiter and several other people not at all concerned in the mob</s>  butafter the affair was over he went up towards the guard and having metwith sandie the turk and his wife who escaped out of prison theyreturned to his house at the abbey and then tis very possible he mayhave thought fitt in his beer to boast of villany in which he could notpossibly have any share for that reason he was desired to find baill andhe should be set at liberty</s>  but he is a stranger and a fellow of veryindifferent character and tis believed it wont be easy for him to findbaill</s>  wherefore its thought he must be sett at liberty without it</s> because he is a burden upon the government while kept in confinement notbeing able to maintain himself</s> what is above is all that relates to persons in custody</s>  but there arewarrands out against a great many other persons who had fledparticularly against one william white a journeyman baxter who by theevidence appears to have been at the beginning of the mob and to havegone along with the drum from the westport to the netherbow and issaid to have been one of those who attacked the guard and probably wasas deep as any one there</s> information was given that he was lurking at falkirk where he was born</s> whereupon directions were sent to the sheriff of the county and awarrand from his excellency generall wade to the commanding officers atstirling and linlithgow to assist and all possible endeavours were usedto catch hold of him and tis said he escaped very narrowly having beenconcealed in some outhouse and the misfortune was that those who wereemployed in the search did not know him personally</s>  nor indeed was iteasy to trust any of the acquaintances of so low obscure a fellow withthe secret of the warrand to be putt in execution</s> there was also strong evidence found against robert taylor servant towilliam and charles thomsons periwigmakers that he acted as aneofficer among the mob and he was traced from the guard to the well atthe head of foresters wynd where he stood and had the appellation ofcaptain from the mob and from that walking down the bow before captainporteus with his lochaber axe and by the description given of one whohawld the rope by which captain porteus was pulled up tis believedtaylor was the person and tis farther probable that the witness whodebated stirling had mistaken taylor for him their stature and age sofar as can be gathered from the description being the same</s> a great deal of pains were taken and no charge was saved in order tohave catched hold of this taylor and warrands were sent to the countrywhere he was born but it appears he had shipt himself off for hollandwhere it is said he now is</s> there is strong evidence also against thomas burns butcher that he wasane active person from the beginning of the mob to the end of it</s>  helurkt for some time amongst those of his trade and artfully enough atrain was laid to catch him under pretence of a message that had comefrom his father in ireland so that he came to a blind alehouse in thefleshmarket close and a party being ready was by webster thesoldier who was upon this exploit advertised to come down</s>  howeverburns escaped out at a backwindow and hid himself in some of the houseswhich are heaped together upon one another in that place so that it wasnot possible to catch him</s>  tis now said he is gone to ireland to hisfather who lives there</s> there is evidence also against one robert anderson journeyman andservant to colin alison wright and against thomas linnen and jamesmaxwell both servants also to the said colin alison who all seem tohave been deeply concerned in the matter</s>  anderson is one of those whoputt the rope upon captain porteuss neck</s>  linnen seems also to have beenvery active and maxwell which is pretty remarkable is proven to havecome to a shop upon the friday before and charged the journeymen andprentices there to attend in the parliament close on tuesday night toassist to hang captain porteus</s>  these three did early abscond andthough warrands had been issued out against them and all endeavours usedto apprehend them could not be found</s> one waldie

she was passing by new cumnock a young manwhose name was william forsyth son of a farmer in the same parishplagued her so much that she wished he might never see the morn uponwhich he went home and hanged himself in his fathers barn</s>  and i doubtnot that many such stories may yet be remembered in other parts where shehad been</s> so far mr</s>  train</s>  the author can only add to this narrative that fecklessfannie and her little flock were well known in the pastoral districts</s>  inattempting to introduce such a character into fiction the author feltthe risk of encountering a comparison with the maria of sterne andbesides the mechanism of the story would have been as much retarded byfeckless fannies flock as the night march of don quixote was delayed bysanchos tale of the sheep that were ferried over the river</s> the author has only to add that notwithstanding the preciseness of hisfriend mr</s>  trains statement there may be some hopes that the outrage onfeckless fannie and her little flock was not carried to extremity</s>  thereis no mention of any trial on account of it which had it occurred inthe manner stated would have certainly taken place and the author hasunderstood that it was on the border she was last seen about the skirtsof the cheviot hills but without her little flock</s> note s</s> death of francis gordon</s> this exploit seems to have been one in which patrick walker pridedhimself not a little and there is reason to fear that that excellentperson would have highly resented the attempt to associate another withhim in the slaughter of a kings lifeguardsman</s>  indeed he would havehad the more right to be offended at losing any share of the glory sincethe party against gordon was already three to one besides having theadvantage of firearms</s>  the manner in which he vindicates his claim to theexploit without committing himself by a direct statement of it is not alittle amusing</s>  it is as followsi shall give a brief and true account of that mans death which i didnot design to do while i was upon the stage i resolve indeed if it bethe lords will to leave a more full account of that and many otherremarkable steps of the

was four milesfrom lanark and near a mile from his comrade seeking his own death andgot it</s>  and for as much as we have been condemned for this i could neversee how any one could condemn us that
