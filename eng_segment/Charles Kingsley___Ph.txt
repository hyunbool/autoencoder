something said alcibiades which protagoras said in hislecture yesterdayhow truth was what each man troweth or believethto be true</s>  so that he said one thing is true to me if ibelieve it true and another opposite thing to you if you believethat opposite</s>  for continued he there is an objective and asubjective truth the former doubtless one and absolute andcontained in the nature of each

was impossible thatthe absolute objective truth of anything could be seen by anymortal but only some partial approximation and as it were sketchof it according as the object was represented with more

suppose led like the animals only by their privatejudgments of things as they seemed to each man and enslaved to thatsubjective truth which we found to be utterly careless and ignorantof facts as they are</s>  but prometheus taking pity on themdetermined in his mind to free them from that slavery and to teachthem to rise above the beasts by seeing things as they are</s>  hetherefore made them acquainted with the secrets of nature andtaught them to build houses to work in wood and metals to observethe courses of the stars and all other such arts and scienceswhich if any man attempts to follow according to his privateopinion and not according to the rules of that art which areindependent of him and of his opinions being discovered from theunchangeable laws of things as they are he will fail</s>  but yet asthe myth relates they became only a more cunning sort of animalsnot being wholly freed from their original slavery to a certainsubjective opinion about themselves that each man should by meansof those arts and sciences please and help himself only</s>  fearingtherefore lest their increased strength and cunning should onlyenable them to prey upon each other all the more fiercely he stolefire from heaven and gave to each man a share thereof for hishearth and to each community for their common altar</s>  and by thelight of this celestial fire they learnt to see those celestial andeternal bonds between man and man as of husband to wife of fatherto child of citizen to his country and of master to servantwithout which man is but a biped without feathers and which are

sunkdown again to the level of the brutes while those who have passedthem down to their children burning bright and strong becomepartakers of the bliss of the heroes in the happy islands</s>  itseems to me then phaethon and alcibiades that if we find ourselvesin anywise destitute of this heavenly fire we should pray for thecoming of that day when prometheus shall be unbound from caucasusif by any means he may take pity on us and on our children andagain bring us down from heaven that fire which is the spirit oftruth that we may see facts as they are</s>  for which if he were toask zeus humbly and filially i cannot believe that he would refuseit</s>  and indeed i think that the poets as is their custom corruptthe minds of young men by telling them that zeus chained prometheusto caucasus for his theft seeing that it befits such a ruler as itake the father of gods and men to be to know that his subjects canonly do well by means of his bounty and therefore to bestow itfreely as the kings of persia do on all who are willing to use itin the service of their sovereign</s> so then said alcibiades laughing till prometheus be unboundfrom caucasus we who have lost as you seem to hint this

neighbours as a token of her own beauty and despised thegod so that he being angry changed her into a chattering magpieor again to arachne who having been taught the art of weaving byathene pretended

behold</s>  but tome considering how great must be the condescension of zeus inunveiling to any man even the worthiest the least portion of hisown loveliness there has come at times a sort of dream that thedivine splendour will at last pierce through and illumine all darksouls even in the house of hades showing them as by a greatsunrise both what they themselves and what all other things

the contrary i shouldrecommend you in your present state of mind to look out your oldplato as quickly as possible and see if he and his master socratescannot give you if not altogether a solution for

feel for him principally because he has broken loose fromit all in desperation just as i have</s>  but to tell you the truthi have been reading more than one book of his school lately and asi said i owe you no thanks for demolishing the little comfort whichi seemed to find in them</s> and what was that then</s> whyin the first place you cant deny that however incoherent theymay be they do say a great many clever things and noble things tooabout man and society and art and nature</s> no doubt of it</s> and moreover they seem to connect all they say withwithi supposeyou will laugh at mewith god and spiritual truths and eternaldivine laws in short to consecrate common matters in that veryway which i could not find in my poor mothers teaching</s> no doubt of that either</s>  and therein is one real value of them asprotests in behalf of something nobler and more unselfish than themere dollargetting spirit of their country</s> well then can you not see how pleasant it was to me to findsomeone who would give me a peep into the unseen world withoutrequiring as an entrancefee any religious emotions and experiences</s> here i had been for years shut out told that i had no

beenthrough all janes mysterious sorrows and joys</s>  and it was reallygood news to me to hear that they were not required after all andthat all i need do was to be a good man and leave devotion to

sympathy even with windrush and his spirit oftruth</s> i can and those of many more</s>  it seems that you thought you foundin that school a wider creed than the one to which you had beenaccustomed</s> there was a more comprehensive view of humanity about them andthat pleased me</s> doubtless one can be easily comprehensive if one comprehends goodand bad true and false under one category by denying the absoluteexistence of either goodness or badness truth or falsehood</s>  butlet the view be as comprehensive as it will i am afraid that thecreed founded thereon will not be very comprehensive</s> why then</s> because it will comprehend so few people fewer even than the sectof those who will believe with mr</s>  emerson that harvey and newtonmade their discoveries by the aristotelian method</s>  the sect ofthose who believe that there is no absolute right and wrong noabsolute truth external to himself discoverable by man will itseems to me be a very narrow one to the end of time owing to acertain primeval superstition of our race who even in barbarouscountries have always been platonists enough to have some sort ofinstinct and hope that there was a right and a wrong and truthsindependent of their own sentiments and faculties</s>  so that thoughthis school may enable you to fancy that you understand lady janesomewhat more by the simple expedient of putting

immeasurably</s> you are severe</s> i only wish you to face one result of a theory which while itpretends to offer the most comprehensive liberality will be foundto lead in practice to the most narrow and sectarian epicurism for acultivated few</s>  but for the many struggling with the innateconsciousness of evil in them and around theman instinctiveconsciousness which no argumentation about evil being a lower formof good will ever explain away to those who grind among the ironfacts of life and have no time for selfdeceptionwhat good newsfor them is there in mr</s>  emersons cosy and tolerant epicurism</s> they cry for deliverance from their natures they know that they arenot that which they were intended to be because they follow theirnatures and he answers them with follow your natures

has taught her that these creeds onlybelong to the few who have discovered their own share in them</s>  butwhether the creeds really do that or notwhether lady jane does notimplicitly confess that they do not by her own words and deeds ofevery day that i say is a question of dialectics in the platonicsense of that word as the science which discovers the true andfalse in thought by discovering

 augustine said fourteen hundredyears ago that socrates was the philosopher of the catholic faith</s> if he has not seemed so of late years it is i suspect because wedo not understand quite the same thing as augustine did when wetalk of the catholic faith and christianity</s> but you forget in your hurry of clerical confidence that thequestion still remains whether these creeds are true</s> that too as i take it is a question of dialectics unless youchoose to reduce the whole to a balanceofprobabilities argumentrather too narrow a basis for a worldfaith to stand upon</s>  try allmythic

fearlessly andhonestly you will unless socrates and plato were fools arrive atabsolute eternal truths which are equally true for all men good orbad conscious or unconscious and i tell youof course you

with you</s> my dear fellow i have seldom met a man who could not be a farbetter dialectician than i shall ever be if he would but use hiscommon sense</s> common sense</s>  that really sounds

scientific method</s> obscure and ancient</s>  did i not just say that any man might be adialectician</s>  did socrates ever appeal to any faculty but thecommon sense of man as man which exists just as much in englandnow i presume as it did in athens in his day</s>  does he not inpursuance of that method of his draw his arguments andillustrations to the horror of the bigworded sophists from dogskettles fishwives and what not which is vulgar and commonplace</s> or did i in my clumsy attempt to imitate him make use of a singleargument which does not lie developed or undeveloped in the commonsense of every clown in that human reason of his which is part ofgods image in him and in every man</s>  and has not my complaintagainst mr</s>  windrushs school been that they will not do this thatthey will not accept the ground which is common to men as men butdisregard that part of the vox populi which is truly vox deifor that which is vox diabolifor private sentiments fancies andaspirations and so casting away the common sense of mankind buildup each man on the pins point of his own private judgment his owninverted pyramid</s> but are you not asking me to do just the same when you propose tome to start as a scientific dialectician</s> why what are dialectics or any other scientific method butconscious common sense</s>  and what is common sense but unconsciousscientific method</s>  every man is a dialectician be he scholar orboor in as far as he tries to use no words which he does notunderstand and to sift his own thoughts and his expression ofthem by that reason which is at once common to men and independentof them</s> as m</s>  jourdain talked prose all his life without knowing it</s>  welli prefer the unconscious method</s>  i have as little faith as mr</s> carlyle would have in saying go to let us makean inductionabout words or anything else</s>  it seems to me no very hopefulmethod of finding out facts as they are</s> certainly provided you mean any particular induction and not ageneral inductive and severelyinquiring habit of mind that verygo to being a fair sign that you have settled beforehand what theinduction shall be in plain english that you have come to yourconclusion already and are now looking about for facts to prove it</s> but is it any wiser to say go to i will be conscious of beingunconscious of being conscious of my own forms of thought</s>  forthat is what you do say when having read plato and knowing hismethod and its coincidence with common sense you determine toignore it on commonsense questions</s> but why not ignore it if motherwit does as well</s> because you cannot ignore it</s>  you have learnt it more or less andcannot forget it try as you will and must either follow it orbreak it and talk nonsense</s>  and moreover you ought not to ignoreit</s>  for it seems to me that you were sent to cambridge by onegreater than your parents in order that you might learn it andbring it home hither for the use of the

any other commonhuman faculty all his life and yet employ them very clumsily anddefectively</s> i should say so from the gross amount of human unwisdom</s> and that in the case of uneducated persons happens because theyare not conscious of those faculties or of their right laws butuse them blindly and capriciously by fits and starts talking senseon one point and nonsense on another</s> too true heaven knows</s> but the educated man if education mean anything is the man whohas become conscious of those common human faculties and their lawsand has learnt to use them continuously and accurately

education is to enable us to deceive or coerce theuneducated for our own aggrandisement</s> i am therefore it seems to get up platonic dialectics simply inorder to teach my ploughmen to use their common sense</s> exactly so</s>  teach yourself first and every one around youafterwards not the doctrines nor the formulasthough he had nonebut the habit of mind which socrates tried in vain to teach

that socratestaught himself for i believe that one taught him who has promisedto teach every man who desires wisdom and in the next place i haveno fear but that the sound practical intellect which that same onehas bestowed on the englishman will give you a far better auditoryin any harvest field than socrates could find among the mercurialathenians of a fallen age</s> well that is at all events
