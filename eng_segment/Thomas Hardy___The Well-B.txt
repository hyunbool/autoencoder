the wellbeloveda sketch of a temperamentby thomas hardyprefacethe peninsula carved by time out of a single stone whereon most of thefollowing scenes are laid has been for centuries immemorial the home

thehour for accompanying her back he went along the middle road northwardto the street of wells</s> he was full of misgiving</s>  he had known avice caro so well of old thathis feeling for her now was rather comradeship than love and what hehad said to her in a moment of impulse that morning rather appalledhim in its consequences</s>  not that any of the more sophisticated andaccomplished women who

in two places at once but hitherto she had neverbeen in one place long</s> by making this clear to his mind some time before today he had escapeda good deal of ugly selfreproach</s>  it was simply that she who alwaysattracted him and led him whither she would as by a silken thread hadnot remained the occupant of the same fleshly tabernacle in her careerso far</s>  whether she would ultimately

increased her present reserve</s>         that day was the beginning of a pleasant month passed mainly in eachothers society</s>  he found that she could not only recite poetry atintellectual gatherings but play the piano fairly and sing to her ownaccompaniment</s> he observed that every aim of those who had brought her up had been toget her away mentally as far as possible from her natural and individuallife as an inhabitant of a peculiar island to make her an exact copyof tens of thousands of other people in whose circumstances there wasnothing special distinctive or picturesque to teach her to forget allthe experiences of her ancestors to drown the local ballads by songspurchased at the budmouth fashionable musicsellers and the localvocabulary by a governesstongue of no country at all</s>  she lived in ahouse that would have been the fortune of an artist and learnt to drawlondon suburban villas from printed copies</s> avice had seen all this

drew near and she looked forward toit sadly but serenely their engagement being now a settled thing</s> pierston thought of the native custom on such occasions which hadprevailed in his and her family for centuries both being of the oldstock of the isle</s>  the influx of kimberlins or foreigners asstrangers from the mainland of wessex were called had led in a largemeasure to its discontinuance but underneath the veneer of aviceseducation many an oldfashioned idea lay slumbering and he wonderedif in her natural melancholy at his leaving she regretted the changingmanners which made unpopular the

overweigh them something more than the naturalsadness of a parting which was not to be long and he decided thatinstead of leaving in the daytime as he had intended he would defer hisdeparture till

pierston saw plainly enough that he owed it to her father being aborn islander with all the ancient island notions of matrimony lyingunderneath his acquired conventions that the stonemerchant did notimmediately insist upon the usual remedy for a daughters precipitancyin such cases but preferred to await issues</s> but the young man still thought that marcia herself when her temperhad quite cooled and she was more conscious of her real position wouldreturn to him in spite of the family hostility</s>  there was no socialreason against such a step</s>  in birth the pair were about on one planeand though marcias family had gained a start in the accumulation ofwealth and in the beginnings of social distinction which lent colourto the feeling that the advantages of the match would be

kindness</s> being in rome as aforesaid pierston returned one evening to hishotel to dine after spending the afternoon among the busts in the longgallery of the vatican</s>  the unconscious habit common to so many peopleof tracing likes in unlikes had often led him to discern or to fancyhe discerned in the roman atmosphere in its lights and shades andparticularly in its reflected or secondary

   thus much marcia</s>  the other thread of his connection with the ancientisle of slingers was stirred by a letter he received from avice a littleafter this date in which she stated that her husband

way</s> as she had not communicated for several long years her expressed wishto see him now was likely to be prompted by something more somethingnewer than memories of him</s>  yet the manner of her writing precluded allsuspicion that she was thinking of him as an old lover whose suit eventshad now made practicable</s>  he told her he was sorry to hear that she hadbeen ill and that he would

previous year and learnt that thoughnow a widow she had plenty of friends and sympathizers about herwhich rendered any immediate attention to her on his part unnecessary</s> considering therefore that there was no great reason why he shouldcall on her so soon and without warning he turned back</s>  perhaps afterall her request had been dictated by a momentary feeling only and aconsiderable strangeness to each other must naturally be the result ofa score of dividing years</s>  descending to the bottom he took his seat inthe train on the shore which soon carried him along the bank
