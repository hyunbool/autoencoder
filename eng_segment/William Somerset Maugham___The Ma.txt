     the magician     a novel by somerset maugham   together with a fragment of autobiography      1908a fragment of autobiographyin 1897 after spending five years at st thomass hospital i passed theexaminations which enabled me to practise medicine</s>  while still a medicalstudent i had published a novel called liza of lambeth which caused amild sensation and on the strength of that i rashly decided to abandondoctoring and earn my living as a writer so as soon as i wasqualified i set out for spain and spent the best part of a year inseville</s>  i amused myself hugely and wrote a bad novel</s>  then i returned tolondon and with a friend of my own age took and furnished a small flatnear victoria station</s>  a maid of all work cooked for us and kept the flatneat and tidy</s>  my friend was at the bar and so i had the day and theflat to myself and my work</s>  during the next six years i wrote severalnovels and a number of plays</s>
 only one of these novels had any successbut even that failed to make the stir that my first one had made</s>  i couldget no manager to take my plays</s>  at last in desperation i sent onewhich i called a man of honour to the stage society which gave twoperformances one on sunday night another on monday afternoon of playswhich unsuitable for the commercial theatre were considered ofsufficient merit to please an intellectual audience</s>  as every one knowsit was the stage society that produced the early plays of bernard shaw</s> the committee accepted a man of honour and w</s> l</s>  courtney who was amember of it thought well enough of my crude play to publish it in thefortnightly review of which he was then editor</s>  it was a feather in mycap</s> though these efforts of mine brought me very little money they attractednot a little attention and i made friends</s>  i was looked upon as apromising young writer and i think i may say it without vanity wasaccepted as a member of the intelligentsia an honourable conditionwhich some years later when i became a popular writer of lightcomedies i lost and have never since regained</s>  i was invited toliterary parties and to parties given by women of rank and fashion whothought it behoved them to patronise the arts</s>  an unattached and fairlypresentable young man is always in demand</s>  i lunched out and dined out</s> since i could not afford to take cabs when i dined out in tails and awhite tie as was then the custom i went and came back by bus</s>  i wasasked to spend weekends in the country</s>  they were something of a trialon account of the tips you had to give to the butler and to the footmanwho brought you your morning tea</s>  he unpacked your gladstone bag andyou were uneasily aware that your wellworn pyjamas and modest toiletarticles had made an unfavourable impression upon him</s>  for all that ifound life pleasant and i enjoyed myself</s>  there seemed no reason why ishould not go on indefinitely in the same way bringing out a novel oncea year which seldom earned more than the small advance the publisherhad given me but which was on the whole respectably reviewed going tomore and more parties making more and more friends</s>  it was all verynice but i couldnt see that it was leading me anywhere</s>  i was thirty</s> i was in a rut</s>  i felt i must get out of it</s>  it did not take me long tomake up my mind</s>  i told the friend with whom i shared the flat that iwanted to be rid of it and go abroad</s>  he could not keep it by himselfbut we luckily found a middleaged gentleman who wished to install hismistress in it and was prepared to take it off our hands</s>  we sold thefurniture for what it could fetch and within a month i was on my way toparis</s>  i took a room in a cheap hotel on the left bank</s> a few months before this i had been fortunate enough to make friendswith a young painter who had a studio in the rue campagne premire</s>  hisname was gerald kelly</s>  he had had an upbringing unusual for a painterfor he had been to eton and to cambridge</s>  he was highly talentedabundantly loquacious and immensely enthusiastic</s>  it was he who firstmade me acquainted with the impressionists whose pictures had recentlybeen accepted by the luxembourg</s>  to my shame i must admit that i couldnot make head or tail of them</s>  without much searching i found anapartment on the fifth floor of a house near the lion de belfort</s>  it hadtwo rooms and a kitchen and cost seven hundred francs a year which wasthen twentyeight pounds</s>  i bought secondhand such furniture andhousehold utensils as were essential and the concierge told me of awoman who would come in for half a day and make my caf au lait in themorning and my luncheon at noon</s>  i settled down and set to work on stillanother novel</s>  soon after my arrival gerald kelly took me to arestaurant called le chat blanc in the rue dodessa near the garemontparnasse where a number of artists were in the habit of diningand from then on i dined there every night</s>  i have described the placeelsewhere and in some detail in the novel to which these pages are meantto serve as a preface so that i need not here say more about it</s>  as arule the same people came in every night but now and then others cameperhaps only once perhaps two or three times</s>  we were apt to look uponthem as interlopers and i dont think we made them particularly welcome</s> it was thus that i first met arnold bennett and clive bell</s>  one of thesecasual visitors was aleister crowley</s>  he was spending the winter inparis</s>  i took an immediate dislike to him but he interested and amusedme</s>  he was a great talker and he talked uncommonly well</s>  in early youthi was told he was extremely handsome but when i knew him he had put onweight and his hair was thinning</s>  he had fine eyes and a way whethernatural or acquired i do not know of so focusing them that when helooked at you he seemed to look behind you</s>  he was a fake but notentirely a fake</s>  at cambridge he had won his chess blue and was esteemedthe best whist player of his time</s>  he was a liar and unbecominglyboastful but the odd thing was that he had actually done some of thethings he boasted of</s>  as a mountaineer he had made an ascent of k2 inthe hindu kush the second highest mountain in india and he made itwithout the elaborate equipment the cylinders of oxygen and so forthwhich render the endeavours of the mountaineers of the present day morelikely to succeed</s>  he did not reach the top but got nearer to it thananyone had done before</s> crowley was a voluminous writer of verse which he published sumptuouslyat his own expense</s>  he had a gift for rhyming and his verse is notentirely without merit</s>  he had been greatly influenced by swinburne androbert browning</s>  he was grossly but not unintelligently imitative</s>  asyou flip through the pages you may well read a stanza which if youcame across it in a volume of swinburnes you would accept withoutquestion as the work of the master</s>  its rather hard isnt it sirto make sense of it</s>  if you were shown this line and asked what poethad written it i think you would be inclined to say robert browning</s> you would be wrong</s>  it was written by aleister crowley</s> at the time i knew him he was dabbling in satanism magic and the occult</s> there was just then something of a vogue in paris for that sort of thingoccasioned i surmise by the interest that was still taken in a book ofhuysmanss l bas</s>  crowley told fantastic stories of his experiencesbut it was hard to say whether he was telling the truth or merely pullingyour leg</s>  during that winter i saw him several times but never after ileft paris to return to london</s>  once long afterwards i received atelegram from him which ran as follows please send twentyfive poundsat once</s>  mother of god and i starving</s>  aleister crowley</s>  i did not doso and he lived on for many disgraceful years</s> i was glad to get back to london</s>  my old friend had by then rooms in pallmall and i was able to take a bedroom in the same building and use hissittingroom to work in</s>  the magician was published in 1908 so isuppose it was written during the first six months of 1907</s>  i do notremember how i came to think that aleister crowley might serve as themodel for the character whom i called oliver haddo nor indeedhow i came to think of writing that particular novel at all</s>
 when alittle while ago my publisher expressed a wish to reissue it i feltthat before consenting to this i really should read it again</s>  nearlyfifty years had passed since i had done so and i had completelyforgotten it</s>  some authors enjoy reading their old works some cannotbear to</s>
 of these i am</s>  when i have corrected the proofs of a book ihave finished with it for good and all</s>  i am impatient when people insiston talking to me about it i am glad if they like it but do not muchcare if they dont</s>  i am no more interested in it than in a wornoutsuit of clothes that i have given away</s>  it was thus with disinclinationthat i began to read the magician</s>  it held my interest as two of myearly novels which for the same reason i have been obliged to read didnot</s>  one indeed i simply could not get through</s>  another had to my mindsome good dramatic scenes but the humour filled me with mortificationand i should have been ashamed to see it republished</s>  as i read themagician i wondered how on earth i could have come by all the materialconcerning the black arts which i wrote of</s>  i must have spent days anddays reading in the library of the british museum</s>  the style is lush andturgid not at all the sort of style i approve of now but perhaps notunsuited to the subject and there are a great many more adverbs andadjectives than i should use today</s>  i fancy i must have been impressed bythe criture artiste which the french writers of the time had not yetentirely abandoned and unwisely sought to imitate them</s> though aleister crowley served as i have said as the model for oliverhaddo it is by no means a portrait of him</s>  i made my character morestriking in appearance more sinister and more ruthless than crowley everwas</s>  i gave him magical powers that crowley though he claimed themcertainly never possessed</s>  crowley however recognized himself in thecreature of my invention for such it was and wrote a fullpage reviewof the novel in vanity fair which he signed oliver haddo</s>  i did notread it and wish now that i had</s>  i daresay it was a pretty piece ofvituperation but probably like his poems intolerably verbose</s> i do not remember what success if any my novel had when it waspublished and i did not bother about it much for by then a great changehad come into my life</s>  the manager of the court theatre one otho stuarthad brought out a play which failed to please and he could notimmediately get the cast he wanted for the next play he had in mind toproduce</s>  he had read one of mine and formed a very poor opinion ofit but he was in a quandary and it occurred to him that it might justserve to keep his theatre open for a few weeks by the end of which theactors he wanted for the play he had been obliged to postpone would be atliberty</s>  he put mine on</s>  it was an immediate success</s>  the result of thiswas that in a very little while other managers accepted the plays theyhad consistently refused and i had four running in london at the sametime</s>  i who for ten years had earned an average of one hundred pounds ayear found myself earning several hundred pounds a week</s>  i made up mymind to abandon the writing of novels for the rest of my life</s>  i did notknow that this was something out of my control and that when the urge towrite a novel seized me i should be able to do nothing but submit</s>  fiveyears later the urge came and refusing to write any more plays for thetime i started upon the longest of all my novels</s>  i called it of humanbondage</s> the magicianiarthur burdon and dr porhot walked in silence</s>  they had lunched at arestaurant in the boulevard saint michel and were sauntering now in thegardens of the luxembourg</s>  dr porhot walked with stooping shoulders hishands behind him</s>  he beheld the scene with the eyes of the many painterswho have sought by means of the most charming garden in paris to expresstheir sense of beauty</s>  the grass was scattered with the fallen leavesbut their wan decay little served to give a touch of nature to theartifice of all besides</s>  the trees were neatly surrounded by bushesand the bushes by trim beds of flowers</s>  but the trees grew withoutabandonment as though conscious of the decorative scheme they helped toform</s>  it was autumn and some were leafless already</s>  many of the flowerswere withered</s>  the formal garden reminded one of a light woman no longeryoung who sought with faded finery with powder and paint to make abrave show of despair</s>  it had those false difficult smiles of uneasygaiety and the pitiful graces which attempt a fascination that thehurrying years have rendered vain</s> dr porhot drew more closely round his fragile body the heavy cloak whicheven in summer he could not persuade himself to discard</s>  the best part ofhis life had been spent in egypt in the practice of medicine and thefrigid summers of europe scarcely warmed his blood</s>  his memory flashedfor an instant upon those multicoloured streets of alexandria and thenlike a homing bird it flew to the green woods and the stormbeatencoasts of his native brittany</s>  his brown eyes were veiled with suddenmelancholy</s> let us wait here for a moment he said</s> they took two strawbottomed chairs and sat near the octagonal waterwhich completes with its fountain of cupids the enchanting artificialityof the luxembourg</s>  the sun shone more kindly now and the trees whichframed the scene were golden and lovely</s>  a balustrade of stone gracefullyenclosed the space and the flowers freshly bedded were very gay</s>  inone corner they could see the squat quaint towers of saint sulpice andon the other side the uneven roofs of the boulevard saint michel</s>
 nurses some in the white caps of theirnative province others with the satin streamers of the nounou marchedsedately two by two wheeling perambulators and talking</s>  brightly dressedchildren trundled hoops or whipped a stubborn top</s>  as he watched them drporhots lips broke into a smile and it was so tender that his thinface sallow from long exposure to subtropical suns was transfigured</s>
he no longer struck you merely as an insignificant little man with hollowcheeks and a thin grey beard for the weariness of expression which washabitual to him vanished before the charming sympathy of his smile</s>  hissunken eyes glittered with a kindly but ironic goodhumour</s>  now passed aguard in the romantic cloak of a brigand in comic opera and a peaked caplike that of an alguacil</s>  a group of telegraph boys in blue stood rounda painter who was making a sketchnotwithstanding halffrozen fingers</s> here and there in baggy corduroys tight jackets and widebrimmed hatsstrolled students who might have stepped from the page of murgersimmortal romance</s>  but the students now are uneasy with the fear ofridicule and more often they walk in bowler hats and the neat coatsof the boulevardier</s> dr porhot spoke english fluently with scarcely a trace of foreignaccent but with an elaboration which suggested that he had learned thelanguage as much from study of the english classics as from conversation</s> and how is miss dauncey</s>  he asked turning to his friend</s> arthur burdon smiled</s> oh i expect shes all right</s>  ive not seen her today but im going totea at the studio this afternoon and we want you to dine with us at thechien noir</s> i shall be much pleased</s>  but do you not wish to be by yourselves</s> she met me at the station yesterday and we dined together</s>  we talkedsteadily from half past six till midnight</s> or rather she talked and you listened with the delighted attention ofa happy lover</s> arthur burdon had just arrived in paris</s>  he was a surgeon on the staff ofst lukes and had come ostensibly to study the methods of the frenchoperators but his real object was certainly to see margaret dauncey</s>  hewas furnished with introductions from london surgeons of repute and hadalready spent a morning at the htel dieu where the operator warnedthat his visitor was a bold and skilful surgeon whose reputation inengland was already considerable had sought to dazzle him by feats thatsavoured almost of legerdemain</s>  though the hint of charlatanry in thefrenchmans methods had not escaped arthur burdons shrewd eyes theaudacious sureness of his hand had excited his enthusiasm</s>  duringluncheon he talked of nothing else and dr porhot drawing upon hismemory recounted the more extraordinary operations that he had witnessedin egypt</s> he had known arthur burdon ever since he was born and indeed had missedbeing present at his birth only because the khedive ismal had summonedhim unexpectedly to cairo</s>  but the levantine merchant who was arthursfather had been his most intimate friend and it was with singularpleasure that dr porhot saw the young man on his advice enter hisown profession and achieve a distinction which himself had never won</s> though too much interested in the characters of the persons whom chancethrew in his path to have much ambition on his own behalf it pleased himto see it in others</s>  he observed with satisfaction the pride which arthurtook in his calling and the determination backed by his confidence andtalent to become a master of his art</s>  dr porhot knew that a diversityof interests though it adds charm to a mans personality tends toweaken him</s>  to excel ones fellows it is needful to be circumscribed</s> he did not regret therefore that arthur in many ways was narrow</s> letters and the arts meant little to him</s>  nor would he trouble himselfwith the graceful trivialities which make a man a good talker</s>  in mixedcompany he was content to listen silently to others and only somethingvery definite to say could tempt him to join in the general conversation</s> he worked very hard operating dissecting or lecturing at his hospitaland took pains to read every word not only in english but in french andgerman which was published concerning his profession</s>  whenever he couldsnatch a free day he spent it on the golflinks of sunningdale for hewas an eager and a fine player</s> but at the operatingtable arthur was different</s>  he was no longer theawkward man of social intercourse who was sufficiently conscious of hislimitations not to talk of what he did not understand and sincere enoughnot to express admiration for what he did not like</s>  then on the otherhand a singular exhilaration filled him he was conscious of his powerand he rejoiced in it</s>  no unforeseen accident was able to confuse him</s> he seemed to have a positive instinct for operating and his hand andhis brain worked in a manner that appeared almost automatic</s>  he neverhesitated and he had no fear of failure</s>  his success had been no lessthan his courage and it was plain that soon his reputation with thepublic would equal that which he had already won with the profession</s> dr porhot had been making listless patterns with his stick upon thegravel and now with that charming smile of his turned to arthur</s> i never cease to be astonished at the unexpectedness of human naturehe remarked</s>  it is really very surprising that a man like you shouldfall so deeply in love with a girl like margaret dauncey</s> arthur made no reply and dr porhot fearing that his words mightoffend hastened to explain</s> you know as well as i do that i think her a very charming young person</s> she has beauty and grace and sympathy</s>  but your characters are moredifferent than chalk and cheese</s>  notwithstanding your birth in the eastand your boyhood spent amid the very scenes of the thousand and onenights you are the most matteroffact creature i have ever comeacross</s> i see no harm in your saying insular smiled arthur</s>  i confess that ihave no imagination and no sense of humour</s>  i am a plain practical manbut i can see to the end of my nose with extreme clearness</s>  fortunatelyit is rather a long one</s> one of my cherished ideas is that it is impossible to love withoutimagination</s> again arthur burdon made no reply but a curious look came into hiseyes as he gazed in front of him</s>  it was the look which might fill thepassionate eyes of a mystic when he saw in ecstasy the divine lady ofhis constant prayers</s> but miss dauncey has none of that narrowness of outlook which if youforgive my saying so is perhaps the secret of your strength</s>  she has adelightful enthusiasm for every form of art</s>  beauty really means as muchto her as bread and butter to the more soberlyminded</s>  and she takes apassionate interest in the variety of life</s> it is right that margaret should care for beauty since there is beautyin every inch of her answered arthur</s> he was too reticent to proceed to any analysis of his feelings buthe knew that he had cared for her first on account of the physicalperfection which contrasted so astonishingly with the countlessdeformities in the study of which his life was spent</s>  but one phraseescaped him almost against his will</s> the first time i saw her i felt as though a new world had opened to myken</s> the divine music of keatss lines rang through arthurs remark and tothe frenchmans mind gave his passion a romantic note that forebodedfuture tragedy</s>  he sought to dispel the cloud which his fancy had castupon the most satisfactory of love affairs</s> you are very lucky my friend</s>  miss margaret admires you as much as youadore her</s>  she is never tired of listening to my prosy stories of yourchildhood in alexandria and im quite sure that she will make you themost admirable of wives</s> you cant be more sure than i am laughed arthur</s> he looked upon himself as a happy man</s>  he loved margaret with all hisheart and he was confident in her great affection for him</s>  it wasimpossible that anything should arise to disturb the pleasant lifewhich they had planned together</s>  his love cast a glamour upon hiswork and his work by contrast made love the more entrancing</s> were going to fix the date of our marriage now he said</s>  im buyingfurniture already</s> i think only english people could have behaved so oddly as you inpostponing your marriage without reason for two mortal years</s> you see margaret was ten when i first saw her and only seventeen wheni asked her to marry me</s>  she thought she had reason to be grateful to meand would have married me there and then</s>  but i knew she hankered afterthese two years in paris and i didnt feel it was fair to bind her to metill she had seen at least something of the world</s>  and she seemed hardlyready for marriage she was growing still</s> did i not say that you were a matteroffact young man</s>  smiled drporhot</s> and its not as if there had been any doubt about our knowing our minds</s> we both cared and we had a long time before us</s>  we could afford towait</s> at that moment a man strolled past them a big stout fellow showilydressed in a check suit and he gravely took off his hat to dr porhot</s> the doctor smiled and returned the salute</s> who is your fat friend</s>  asked arthur</s> that is a compatriot of yours</s>  his name is oliver haddo</s> artstudent</s>  inquired arthur with the scornful tone he used whenreferring to those whose walk in life was not so practical as his own</s> not exactly</s>  i met him a little while ago by chance</s>  when i was gettingtogether the material for my little book on the old alchemists i read agreat deal at the library of the arsenal which you may have heard issingularly rich in all works dealing with the occult sciences</s> burdens face assumed an expression of amused disdain</s>  he could notunderstand why dr porhot occupied his leisure with studies soprofitless</s>  he had read his book recently published on the morefamous of the alchemists and though forced to admire the profoundknowledge upon which it was based he could not forgive the waste oftime which his friend might have expended more usefully on topics ofpressing moment</s> not many people study in that library pursued the doctor and isoon knew by sight those who were frequently there</s>  i saw this gentlemanevery day</s>  he was immersed in strange old books when i arrived early inthe morning and he was reading them still when i left exhausted</s> sometimes it happened that he had the volumes i asked for and idiscovered that he was studying the same subjects as myself</s>  hisappearance was extraordinary but scarcely sympathetic so though ifancied that he gave me opportunities to address him i did not availmyself of them</s>  one day however curiously enough i was looking upsome point upon which it seemed impossible to find authorities</s>  thelibrarian could not help me and i had given up the search when thisperson brought me the very book i needed</s>  i surmised that the librarianhad told him of my difficulty</s>  i was very grateful to the stranger</s>  weleft together that afternoon and our kindred studies gave us a commontopic of conversation</s>  i found that his reading was extraordinarily wideand he was able to give me information about works which i had nevereven heard of</s>  he had the advantage over me that he could apparentlyread hebrew as well as arabic and he had studied the kabbalah in theoriginal</s> and much good it did him i have no doubt said arthur</s>  and what is heby profession</s> dr porhot gave a deprecating smile</s> my dear fellow i hardly like to tell you</s>  i tremble in every limb atthe thought of your unmitigated scorn</s> well</s> you know paris is full of queer people</s>  it is the chosen home of everykind of eccentricity</s>  it sounds incredible in this year of grace but myfriend oliver haddo claims to be a magician</s>  i think he is quiteserious</s> silly ass</s>  answered arthur with emphasis</s> 2margaret dauncey shared a flat near the boulevard du montparnasse withsusie boyd and it was to meet her that arthur had arranged to come totea that afternoon</s>  the young women waited for him in the studio</s>  thekettle was boiling on the stove cups and petits fours stood inreadiness on a model stand</s>  susie looked forward to the meeting withinterest</s>  she had heard a good deal of the young man and knew that theconnexion between him and margaret was not lacking in romance</s>  for yearssusie had led the monotonous life of a mistress in a school for youngladies and had resigned herself to its dreariness for the rest of herlife when a legacy from a distant relation gave her sufficient incometo live modestly upon her means</s>  when margaret who had been her pupilcame soon after this to announce her intention of spending a coupleof years in paris to study art susie willingly agreed to accompanyher</s>  since then she had worked industriously at colarossis academyby no means under the delusion that she had talent but merely toamuse herself</s>  she refused to surrender the pleasing notion that herenvironment was slightly wicked</s>  after the toil of many years it relievedher to be earnest in nothing and she found infinite satisfaction inwatching the lives of those around her</s> she had a great affection for margaret and though her own stock ofenthusiasms was run low she could enjoy thoroughly margarets youngenchantment in all that was exquisite</s>  she was a plain woman but therewas no envy in her and she took the keenest pleasure in margaretscomeliness</s>  it was almost with maternal pride that she watched each yearadd a new grace to that exceeding beauty</s>  but her common sense was soundand she took care by goodnatured banter to temper the praises whichextravagant admirers at the drawingclass lavished upon the handsome girlboth for her looks and for her talent</s>  she was proud to think that shewould hand over to arthur burdon a woman whose character she had helpedto form and whose loveliness she had cultivated with a delicate care</s> susie knew partly from fragments of letters which margaret read to herpartly from her conversation how passionately he adored his bride andit pleased her to see that margaret loved him in return with a gratefuldevotion</s>  the story of this visit to paris touched her imagination</s> margaret was the daughter of a country barrister with whom arthur hadbeen in the habit of staying and when he died many years after hiswife arthur found himself the girls guardian and executor</s>  he sent herto school saw that she had everything she could possibly want and whenat seventeen she told him of her wish to go to paris and learn drawinghe at once consented</s>  but

great painter</s>  he has the mostfascinating sense of colour in the world and the more intoxicated he isthe more delicate and beautiful is his painting</s>  sometimes after morethan the usual number

arthurlooked away quickly for catching his eye she gave him an amorousglance</s>  rouge had more the appearance of a prosperous tradesman than ofan artist but he carried on with obrien whose french

horsey way and he walked withbowlegs as though he spent most of his time in the saddle</s>  he aloneused scented pomade upon his neat smooth hair</s>  his chief distinctionwas a greatcoat he wore with

hand and drew a square and certain mystical marks onthe palm</s>  in the centre of the square he poured a little ink</s>  this formedthe magic mirror</s>  he desired the boy to look steadily into it withoutraising his head</s>  the fumes of the incense filled the room with smoke</s> the sorcerer muttered arabic words indistinctly and this he continuedto do all the time except when he asked the

said</s> when he has done sweeping tell me said the sheikh</s> he has done said the boy</s> the sorcerer turned to me and asked who it was that i wished the boyshould see</s> i desire to see the widow

the magician put the second and third of the small strips of paper intothe chafingdish and fresh frankincense was added</s>  the fumes werepainful to my eyes</s>  the boy began to speak</s> i see an old woman lying on a bed</s>  she has a black dress and on herhead is a little white cap</s>  she has a wrinkled face and her eyes areclosed</s>  there is a band tied round her chin</s>  the bed is in a sort ofhole in the wall and there are shutters to it</s> the boy was describing a breton bed and the white cap was the coiffethat my mother wore</s>  and if she lay there in her black dress with a bandabout her chin i knew that it could mean but one thing</s> what else does he see</s>  i asked the sorcerer</s> he repeated my question and presently the boy spoke again</s> i see four men come in

mysteries than any adept since the divine paracelsus</s> i met him once interrupted dr porhot</s>  you never saw a man who lookedless like a magician</s>  his face beamed with goodnature and he wore along grey beard which covered nearly the whole of his breast</s>  he was ofa short and very corpulent figure</s> the practice of black arts evidently disposes to obesity said arthuricily</s> susie noticed that this time oliver haddo made no sign that the tauntmoved him</s>  his unwinking straight eyes remained upon arthur withoutexpression</s> levis real name was alphonselouis constant but he adopted that underwhich he is generally known for reasons that are plain to the romanticmind</s>  his father was a bootmaker</s>  he was destined for the priesthood butfell in love with a damsel fair and married her</s>  the union was unhappy</s> a fate befell him which has been the lot of greater men than he and hiswife presently abandoned the marital roof with her lover</s>  to consolehimself he began to make serious researches in the occult and in duecourse published a vast number of mystical works dealing with magic inall its branches</s> im sure mr haddo was going to tell us something very interesting abouthim said susie</s> i wished merely to give you his account of how he raised the spirit ofapollonius of tyana in london</s> susie settled herself more comfortably in her chair and lit a cigarette</s> he went there in the spring of 1856 to escape from internal disquietudeand to devote himself without distraction to his studies</s>  he had lettersof introduction to various persons of distinction who concernedthemselves with the supernatural but finding them trivial andindifferent he immersed himself in the study of the supreme kabbalah</s> one day on returning to his hotel he found a note in his room</s>  itcontained half a card transversely divided on which he at oncerecognized the character of solomons seal and a tiny slip of paper onwhich was written in pencil the other half of this card will be givenyou at three oclock tomorrow in front of westminster abbey</s>  next daygoing to the appointed spot with his portion of the card in his hand hefound a baronial equipage waiting for him</s>  a footman approached andmaking a sign to him opened the carriage door</s>  within was a lady inblack satin whose face was concealed by a thick veil</s>  she motioned himto a seat beside her and at the same time displayed the other part ofthe card he had received</s>  the door was shut and the carriage rolledaway</s>  when the lady raised her veil eliphas levi saw that she was ofmature age and beneath her grey eyebrows were bright black eyes ofpreternatural fixity</s> susie boyd clapped her hands with delight</s> i think its delicious and im sure every word of it is true shecried</s>  im enchanted with the mysterious meeting at westminster abbeyin the midvictorian era</s>  cant you see the elderly lady in a hugecrinoline and a black poke bonnet and the wizard in a ridiculous hata bottlegreen frockcoat and a flowing tie of black silk</s> eliphas remarks that the lady spoke french with a marked englishaccent pursued haddo imperturbably</s>  she addressed him as followssir i am aware that the law of secrecy is rigorous among adepts and iknow that you have been asked for phenomena but have declined to gratifya frivolous curiosity</s>  it is possible that you do not possess thenecessary materials</s>  i can show you a complete magical cabinet but imust require of you first the most inviolable silence</s>  if you do notguarantee this on your honour i will give the order for you to be drivenhome</s> oliver haddo told his story not ineffectively but with a comic gravitythat prevented one from knowing exactly how to take it</s> having given the required promise eliphas levi was shown a collection ofvestments and of magical instruments</s>  the lady lent him certain books ofwhich he was in need and at last as a result of many conversationsdetermined him to attempt at her house the experience of a completeevocation</s>  he prepared himself for twentyone days scrupulouslyobserving the rules laid down by the ritual</s>  at length everythingwas ready</s>  it was proposed to call forth the phantom of the divineapollonius and to question it upon two matters one of which concernedeliphas levi and the other the lady of the crinoline</s>  she had at firstcounted on assisting at the evocation with a trustworthy person but atthe last moment her friend drew back and as the triad or unity isrigorously prescribed in magical rites eliphas was left alone</s>  thecabinet prepared for the experiment was situated in a turret</s>  fourconcave mirrors were hung within it and there was an altar of whitemarble surrounded by a chain of magnetic iron</s>  on it was engravedthe sign of the pentagram and this symbol was drawn on the new whitesheepskin which was stretched beneath</s>  a copper brazier stood on thealtar with charcoal of alder and of laurel wood and in front a secondbrazier was placed upon a tripod</s>  eliphas levi was clothed in a whiterobe longer and more ample than the surplice of a priest and he woreupon his head a chaplet of vervain leaves entwined about a golden chain</s> in one hand he held a new sword and in the other the ritual</s> susies passion for caricature at once asserted itself and she laughedas she saw in fancy the portly little frenchman with his round redface thus wonderfully attired</s> he set alight the two fires with the prepared materials and began atfirst in a low voice but rising by degrees the invocations of theritual</s>  the flames invested every object with a wavering light</s>  presentlythey went out</s>  he set more twigs and perfumes on the brazier and whenthe flame started up once more he saw distinctly before the altar ahuman figure larger than life which dissolved and disappeared</s>  he beganthe invocations again and placed himself in a circle which he hadalready traced between the altar and the tripod</s>  then the depth of themirror which was in front of him grew brighter by degrees and a paleform arose and it seemed gradually to approach</s>  he closed his eyes andcalled three times upon apollonius</s>  when he opened them a man stoodbefore him wholly enveloped in a winding sheet which seemed more greythan black</s>  his form was lean melancholy and beardless</s>  eliphas felt anintense cold and when he sought to ask his questions found it impossibleto speak</s>  thereupon he placed his hand on the pentagram and directedthe point of his sword toward the figure adjuring it mentally by thatsign not to terrify but to obey him</s>  the form suddenly grew indistinctand soon it strangely vanished</s>  he commanded it to return and then feltas it were an air pass by him and something having touched the handwhich held the sword his arm was immediately benumbed as far as theshoulder</s>  he supposed that the weapon displeased the spirit and set itdown within the circle</s>  the human figure at once reappeared but eliphasexperienced such a sudden exhaustion in all his limbs that he was obligedto sit down</s>  he fell into a deep coma and dreamed strange dreams</s>  but ofthese when he recovered only a vague memory remained to him</s>  his armcontinued for several days to be numb and painful</s>
 the figure had notspoken but it seemed to eliphas levi that the questions were answered inhis own mind</s>  for to each an inner voice replied with one grim worddead</s> your friend seems to have had as little fear of spooks as you haveof lions said burdon</s>  to my thinking it is plain that all thesepreparations and the perfumes the mirrors the pentagrams must havethe greatest effect on the imagination</s>  my only surprise is that yourmagician saw no more</s> eliphas levi talked to me himself of this evocation said dr porhot</s> he told me that its influence on him was very great</s>  he was no longerthe same man for it seemed to him that something from the world beyondhad passed into his soul</s> i am astonished that you should never have tried such an interestingexperiment yourself said arthur to oliver haddo</s> i have answered the other calmly</s>  my father lost his power of speechshortly before he died and it was plain that he sought with all hismight to tell me something</s>  a year after his death i called up hisphantom from the grave so that i might learn what i took to be a dyingwish</s>  the circumstances of the apparition are so similar to those i havejust told you that it would only bore you if i repeated them</s>  the onlydifference was that my father actually spoke</s> what did he say</s>  asked susie</s> he said solemnly buy ashantis they are bound to go up</s> i did as he told me but my father was always unlucky in speculationand they went down steadily</s>  i sold out at considerable loss andconcluded that in the world beyond they are as ignorant of the tendencyof the stock exchange as we are in this vale of sorrow</s> susie could not help laughing</s>  but arthur shrugged his shouldersimpatiently</s>  it disturbed his practical mind never to be certain ifhaddo was serious or if as now he was plainly making game of them</s> 6two days later arthur received frank hurrells answer to his letter</s>  itwas characteristic of frank that he should take such pains to reply atlength to the inquiry and it was clear that he had lost none of his oldinterest in odd personalities</s>  he analysed oliver haddos character withthe patience of a scientific man studying a new species in which he ispassionately concerned</s> my dear burdonit is singular that you should write just now to ask what i know ofoliver haddo since by chance i met the other night at dinner at queenannes gate a man who had much to tell me of him</s>  i am curious to knowwhy he excites your interest for i am sure his peculiarities make himrepugnant to a person of your robust common sense</s>  i can with difficultyimagine two men less capable of getting on together</s>  though i have notseen haddo now for years i can tell you in one way and another a gooddeal about him</s>  he erred when he described me as his intimate friend</s>  itis true that at one time i saw much of him but i never ceased cordiallyto dislike him</s>  he came up to oxford from eton with a reputation forathletics and eccentricity</s>  but you know that there is nothing thatarouses the illwill of boys more than the latter and he achieved anunpopularity which was remarkable</s>  it turned out that he played footballadmirably and except for his rather scornful indolence he might easilyhave got his blue</s>  he sneered at the popular enthusiasm for games andwas used to say that cricket was all very well for boys but not fit forthe pastime of men</s>  he was then eighteen</s>  he talked grandiloquently ofbiggame shooting and of mountain climbing as sports which demandedcourage and selfreliance</s>  he seemed indeed to like football but heplayed it with a brutal savagery which the other persons concernednaturally resented</s>  it became current opinion in other pursuits that hedid not play the game</s>  he did nothing that was manifestly unfair but wascapable of taking advantages which most people would have thought meanand he made defeat more hard to bear because he exulted over thevanquished with the coarse banter that youths find so difficult toendure</s> what you would hardly believe is that when he first came up he was aperson of great physical attractions</s>  he is now grown fat but in thosedays was extremely handsome</s>  he reminded one of those colossal statuesof apollo in which the god is represented with a feminine roundnessand delicacy</s>  he was very tall and had a magnificent figure</s>  it wasso wellformed for his age that one might have foretold his preciouscorpulence</s>  he held himself with a dashing erectness</s>  many called it aninsolent swagger</s>  his features were regular and fine</s>  he had a greatquantity of curling hair which was worn long with a sort of poeticgrace i am told that now he is very bald and i can imagine that thismust be a great blow to him for he was always exceedingly vain</s>  iremember a peculiarity of his eyes which could scarcely have beennatural but how it was acquired i do not know</s>  the eyes of most peopleconverge upon the object at which they look but his remained parallel</s> it gave them a singular expression as though he were scrutinising theinmost thought of the person with whom he talked</s>  he was notorious alsofor the extravagance of his costume but unlike the aesthetes of thatday who clothed themselves with artistic carelessness he had a tastefor outrageous colours</s>  sometimes by a queer freak he dressed himselfat unseasonable moments with excessive formality</s>  he is the onlyundergraduate i have ever seen walk down the high in a tall hat and acloselybuttoned frockcoat</s> i have told you he was very unpopular but it was not an unpopularityof the sort which ignores a man and leaves him chiefly to his ownsociety</s>  haddo knew everybody and was to be found in the most unlikelyplaces</s>  though people disliked him they showed a curious pleasure in hiscompany and he was probably entertained more than any man in oxford</s>  inever saw him but he was surrounded by a little crowd who abused himbehind his back but could not resist his fascination</s> i often tried to analyse this for i felt it as much as anyone andthough i honestly could not bear him i could never resist going tosee him whenever opportunity arose</s>  i suppose he offered the charmof the unexpected to that mass of undergraduates who for all theirmatteroffact breeziness are curiously alive to the romantic</s>  it wasimpossible to tell what he would do or say next and you were keptperpetually on the alert</s>  he was certainly not witty but he had a coarsehumour which excited the rather gross sense of the ludicrous possessed bythe young</s>  he had a gift for caricature which was really diverting andan imperturbable assurance</s>  he had also an ingenious talent forprofanity and his inventiveness in this particular was a power amongyouths whose imaginations stopped at the commoner sorts of bad language</s> i have heard him preach a sermon of the most blasphemous sort in the veryaccents of the late dean of christ church which outraged and at the sametime irresistibly amused everyone who heard it</s>  he had a more variedknowledge than the greater part of undergraduates and having at thesame time a retentive memory and considerable quickness he was able toassume an attitude of omniscience which was as impressive as it wasirritating</s>  i have never heard him confess that he had not read a book</s> often when i tried to catch him he confounded me by quoting theidentical words of a passage in some work which i could have sworn he hadnever set eyes on</s>  i daresay it was due only to some juggling like theconjurors sleight of hand that apparently lets you choose a card but infact forces one on you and he brought the conversation round cleverly toa point when it was obvious i should mention a definite book</s>  he talkedvery well with an entertaining flow of rather pompous language whichmade the amusing things he said particularly funny</s>  his passion foreuphuism contrasted strikingly with the simple speech of those with whomhe consorted</s>  it certainly added authority to what he said</s>  he was proudof his family and never hesitated to tell the curious of hisdistinguished descent</s>  unless he has much altered you will already haveheard of his relationship with various noble houses</s>  he is in factnearly connected with persons of importance and his ancestry is no lessdistinguished than he asserts</s>  his father is dead and he owns a place instaffordshire which is almost historic</s>  i have seen photographs of itand it is certainly very fine</s>  his forebears have been noted in thehistory of england since the days of the courtier who accompanied anne ofdenmark to scotland and if he is proud of his stock it is not withoutcause</s>  so he passed his time at oxford cordially disliked at the sametime respected and mistrusted he had the reputation of a liar and arogue but it could not be denied that he had considerable influence overothers</s>  he amused angered irritated and interested everyone with whomhe came in contact</s>  there was always something mysterious about him andhe loved to wrap himself in a romantic impenetrability</s>  though he knew somany people no one knew him and to the end he remained a stranger inour midst</s>  a legend grew up around him which he fostered sedulously andit was reported that he had secret vices which could only be whisperedwith bated breath</s>  he was said to intoxicate himself with oriental drugsand to haunt the vilest opiumdens in the east of london</s>  he kept thegreatest surprise for the last since though he was never seen to workhe managed to the universal surprise to get a first</s>  he went down andto the best of my belief was never seen in oxford again</s> i have heard vaguely that he was travelling over the world and wheni met in town now and then some of the fellows who had known him at thevarsity weird rumours reached me</s>  one told me that he was trampingacross america earning his living as he went another asserted that hehad been seen in a monastry in india a third assured me that he hadmarried a balletgirl in milan and someone else was positive that hehad taken to drink</s>  one opinion however was common to all myinformants and this was that he did something out of the common</s>  itwas clear that he was not the man to settle down to the tame life of acountry gentleman which his position and fortune indicated</s>  at last i methim one day in piccadilly and we dined together at the savoy</s>  i hardlyrecognized him for he was become enormously stout and his hair hadalready grown thin</s>  though he could not have been more than twentyfivehe looked considerably older</s>  i tried to find out what he had been up tobut with the air of mystery he affects he would go into no details</s>  hegave me to understand that he had sojourned in lands where the white manhad never been before and had learnt esoteric secrets which overthrewthe foundations of modern science</s>  it seemed to me that he had coarsenedin mind as well as in appearance</s>  i do not know if it was due to my owndevelopment since the old days at oxford and to my greater knowledge ofthe world but he did not seem to me so brilliant as i remembered</s>  hisfacile banter was rather stupid</s>  in fact he bored me</s>  the pose which hadseemed amusing in a lad fresh from eton now was intolerable and i wasglad to leave him</s>  it was characteristic that after asking me to dinnerhe left me in a lordly way to pay the bill</s> then i heard nothing of him till the other day when our friend miss leyasked me to meet at dinner the german explorer burkhardt</s>  i dare say youremember that burkhardt brought out a book a little while ago on hisadventures in central asia</s>  i knew that oliver haddo was his companion inthat journey and had meant to read it on this account but having beenexcessively busy had omitted to do so</s>  i took the opportunity to ask thegerman about our common acquaintance and we had a long talk</s>  burkhardthad met him by chance at mombasa in east africa where he was arrangingan expedition after big game and they agreed to go together</s>  he told methat haddo was a marvellous shot and a hunter of exceptional ability</s> burkhardt had been rather suspicious of a man who boasted so much of hisattainments but was obliged soon to confess that he boasted of nothingunjustly</s>  haddo has had an extraordinary experience the truth of whichburkhardt can vouch for</s>  he went out alone one night on the trail ofthree lions and killed them all before morning with one shot each</s>  i knownothing of these things but from the way in which burkhardt spoke ijudge it must be a unique occurrence</s>  but characteristically enough noone was more conscious than haddo of the singularity of his feat and hemade life almost insufferable for his fellowtraveller in consequence</s> burkhardt assures me that haddo is really remarkable in pursuit of biggame</s>  he has a sort of instinct which leads him to the most unlikelyplaces and a wonderful feeling for country whereby he can cut acrossand head off animals whose spoor he has noticed</s>  his courage is verygreat</s>  to follow a wounded lion into thick cover is the most dangerousproceeding in the world and demands the utmost coolness</s>  the animalinvariably sees the sportsman before he sees it and in most casescharges</s>  but haddo never hesitated on these occasions and burkhardtcould only express entire admiration for his pluck</s>  it appears that he isnot what is called a good sportsman</s>  he kills wantonly when there can beno possible excuse for the mere pleasure of it and to burkhardtsindignation frequently shot beasts whose skins and horns they did noteven trouble to take</s>  when antelope were so far off that it wasimpossible to kill them and the approach of night made it useless tofollow he would often shoot and leave a wretched wounded beast to dieby inches</s>  his selfishness was extreme and he never shared anyinformation with his friend that might rob him of an uninterruptedpursuit of game</s>  but notwithstanding all this burkhardt had so high anopinion of haddos general capacity and of his resourcefulness that whenhe was arranging his journey in asia he asked him to come also</s>  haddoconsented and it appears that burkhardts book gives further proof ifit is needed of the mans extraordinary qualities</s>  the german confessedthat on more than one occasion he owed his life to haddos rare powerof seizing opportunities</s>  but they quarrelled at last through haddosoverbearing treatment of the natives</s>  burkhardt had vaguely suspectedhim of cruelty but at length it was clear that he used them in a mannerwhich could not be defended</s>  finally he had a desperate quarrel with oneof the camp servants as a result of which the man was shot dead</s>  haddoswore that he fired in selfdefence but his action caused a generaldesertion and the travellers found themselves in a very dangerouspredicament</s>  burkhardt thought that haddo was clearly to blame andrefused to have anything more to do with him</s>  they separated</s>  burkhardtreturned to england and haddo pursued by the friends of the murderedman had great difficulty in escaping with his life</s>  nothing has beenheard of him since till i got your letter</s> altogether an extraordinary man</s>  i confess that i can make nothing ofhim</s>  i shall never be surprised to hear anything in connexion with him</s> i recommend you to avoid him like the plague</s>  he can be no ones friend</s> as an acquaintance he is treacherous and insincere as an enemy i canwell imagine that he would be as merciless as he is unscrupulous</s> an immensely long letter</s> goodbye my son</s>  i hope that your studies in french

margaret had bought lately a number of clothes and these she hadinsisted should be sent to her dressmaker saying that it was needlessto cumber their little apartment with them</s>  they could stay

hope you didnt let them go till your bill was paid said susielightly as though in jest</s> the dressmaker laughed</s> mademoiselle paid for everything two or three days ago</s> with indignation susie

tothe consulate and her last doubt was dissipated</s>  then nothing remainedbut to go home and wait for arthur</s>  her first impulse had been to see drporhot and ask for his advice but even if he

 i ought to have remembered how passionatelyyou love her</s> it was very painful to see the effort he made to regain his selfcommand</s> susie suffered as much as he did</s>  her impulse was to throw herself on herknees and kiss his hands and comfort him but she knew that he wasinterested in her only because she was margarets friend</s>  at last hegot up and taking his pipe from his pocket filled it silently</s>  she wasterrified at the look on his face</s>  the first time she had ever seen himsusie wondered at the possibility of selftorture which was in thatroughhewn countenance but she had never dreamed that it could expresssuch unutterable suffering</s>  its lines were suddenly changed and it wasterrible to look upon</s> i cant believe its true he muttered</s>  i cant believe it</s> there was a knock at the door and arthur gave a startled cry</s> perhaps shes come back</s> he opened it hurriedly his face suddenly lit up by expectation but itwas dr porhot</s> how do you do</s>  said the frenchman</s>  what is happening</s> he looked round and caught the dismay that was on the faces of arthur andsusie</s> where is miss margaret</s>  i thought you must be giving a party</s> there was something in his manner that made susie ask why</s> i received a telegram from mr haddo this morning</s> he took it from his pocket and handed it to susie</s>  she read it and passedit to arthur</s>  it saidcome to the studio at five</s>

assurprised as distressed as they</s> but what is the explanation of it all</s>  he asked</s> arthur shrugged his shoulders wearily</s> she cared for haddo more than she cared for me i suppose</s>  it isnatural enough that she should go away in this fashion rather than offerexplanations</s>  i suppose she wanted to save herself a scene she thoughtmight be rather painful</s> when did you see her last</s> we spent yesterday evening together</s> and did she not show in any way that she contemplated such a step</s> arthur shook his head</s> you had no quarrel</s> weve never quarrelled</s>  she was in the best of spirits</s>  ive never seenher more gay</s>  she talked the whole time of our house in london and ofthe places we must visit when we were married</s> another contraction of pain passed over his face as he remembered thatshe had been more affectionate than she had ever been before</s>  the fireof her kisses still burnt upon his lips</s>  he had spent a night of almostsleepless ecstasy because he had been certain for the first time that thepassion which consumed him burnt in her heart too</s>  words were dragged outof him against his will</s> oh im sure she loved me</s> meanwhile susies eyes were fixed on haddos cruel telegram</s>  she seemedto hear his mocking laughter</s> margaret loathed oliver haddo with a hatred that was almost unnatural</s> it was a physical repulsion like that which people sometimes have forcertain animals</s>  what can have happened to change it into so great a lovethat it has made her capable of such villainous acts</s> we mustnt be unfair to him said arthur</s>  he put our backs up and wewere probably unjust</s>  he has done some very remarkable things in his dayand hes no fool</s>  its possible that some people wouldnt mind

her</s>  it would notmake her treachery so intolerable if he could persuade himself that haddohad qualities which might explain her infatuation</s>  but as his enemy stoodbefore his fancy monstrously

shell return he cried</s> would you take her back if she came to you</s>  asked susie</s> do you think anything she can do has the power to make me love her less</s> there must be reasons of which we know nothing that caused her to do allshe has done</s>  i daresay it was inevitable from the beginning</s> dr porhot got up and walked across the room</s> if a woman had done me such an injury that i wanted to take somehorrible vengeance i think i could devise nothing more subtly cruel thanto let her be married to oliver haddo</s> ah poor thing poor thing</s>  said arthur</s>  if i could only suppose shewould be happy</s>  the future terrifies me</s> i wonder if she knew that haddo had sent that telegram said susie</s> what can it matter</s> she turned to arthur gravely</s> do you remember that day in this studio when he kicked margaretsdog and you thrashed him</s>  well afterwards when he thought no one sawhim i happened to catch sight of his face</s>  i never saw in my life

had made up his mind torevenge himself but you laughed at me</s>  and then he seemed to go out ofour lives and i thought no more about it</s>  i wonder why he sent dr porhothere today</s>  he must have known that the doctor would hear of hishumiliation and he may have wished that he should be present at histriumph</s>  i think that very moment he made up his mind to be even withyou and he devised this odious scheme</s> how could he know that it was possible to carry out such a horriblething</s>  said arthur</s> i wonder if miss boyd is right murmured the doctor</s>  after all ifyou come to think of it he must have thought that he couldnt hurtyou more</s>  the whole thing is fiendish</s>  he took away from you all yourhappiness</s>  he must have known that you wanted nothing in

her soul must be horriblybesmirched he must have entirely changed her personality</s> ah i feel that cried arthur</s>  if margaret has broken her word to meif shes gone to him so callously its because

way to excuse her and that is by supposing sheacted under some strange compulsion</s> arthur clenched his hands</s> im not sure if that doesnt make it more awful than before</s>  if hesmarried her not because he cares but in order to hurt me what lifewill she lead with him</s>  we know how heartless he is how vindictive howhorribly cruel</s> dr porhot knows more about these things than we do said

obscurity</s>  the adepts in magic make strange claims</s>  arthuris a man of science and he knows what the limits of hypnotism are</s> we know that haddo had powers that other men have not answered

confused that i cannot think sanely</s>  at this momenteverything seems possible</s>  my faith in all the truths that have supportedme is tottering</s> for a while they remained silent</s>  arthurs

said was obviously true and no reply was possible</s> the only thing is to grin and bear it said arthur rising</s> where are you going</s>  said susie</s> i think i want to get away from paris</s>  here everything will remind me ofwhat i have lost</s>  i must get back to my work</s> he had regained command over himself and except for the hopeless woe ofhis face which he could not prevent from

box of chocolates early this morning with a card onwhich was written i think the odd trick is mine</s> this cruel vindictiveness joined with a schoolboy love of taunting thevanquished foe was very characteristic</s>  susie gave arthur burdon thenote which she had found in margarets room</s>  he read it and then thoughtfor a long time</s> im afraid shes right he said at length</s>  it seems quite hopeless</s> the man has some power over her which we cant counteract</s> susie wondered whether his strong scepticism was failing at last</s> she could not withstand her own feeling that there was somethingpreternatural about the hold that oliver had over margaret</s>  she hadno shadow of a doubt that he was able to affect his wife even at adistance and was convinced now that the restlessness of the last fewdays was due to this mysterious power</s>  he had been at work in somestrange way and margaret had been aware of it</s>  at length she couldnot resist and had gone to him

you know that he is learned in everybranch of the occult and perhaps he might help us</s> but arthur pulled himself together</s> its absurd</s>  we mustnt give way to superstition</s>  haddo is merely ascoundrel and a charlatan</s>  hes worked on our nerves as hes worked onpoor margarets</s>  its impossible to suppose that he has any powersgreater than the common run of mankind</s> even after all youve seen with your own eyes</s> if my eyes show me what all my training assures me is impossible i canonly conclude that my eyes deceive me</s> well i shall run over to paris</s> 13some weeks later dr porhot was sitting among his books in the quiet lowroom that overlooked the seine</s>  he had given himself over to a pleasingmelancholy</s>  the heat beat down upon the noisy streets of paris and thedin of the great city penetrated even to his fastness in the le saintlouis</s>  he remembered the cloudladen sky of the country where he wasborn and the southwest wind that blew with a salt freshness</s>  the longstreets of brest present to his fancy always in a drizzle of rain withthe lights of cafs reflected on the wet pavements had a familiar charm</s> even in foul weather the sailormen who trudged along them gave one acurious sense of comfort</s>  there was delight in the smell of the sea andin the freedom of the great atlantic</s>  and then he thought of the greenlanes and of the waste places with their scented heather the fair broadroads that led from one old sweet town to another of the pardons andtheir gentle sad crowds</s>  dr porhot gave a sigh</s> it is good to be born in the land of brittany he smiled</s> but his bonne showed susie in and he rose with a smile to greet her</s> she had been in paris for some time and they had seen much of oneanother</s>  he basked in the gentle sympathy with which she interestedherself in all the abstruse quaint matters on which he spent his timeand divining her love for arthur he admired the courage with which sheeffaced herself</s>  they had got into the habit of eating many of theirmeals together in a quiet house opposite the cluny called la reineblanche and here they had talked of so many things that theiracquaintance was grown into a charming friendship</s> im ashamed to come here so often said susie as she entered</s>  matildeis beginning to look at me with a suspicious eye</s> it is very good of you to entertain a tiresome old man he smiledas he held her hand</s>  but i should have been disappointed if you hadforgotten your promise to come this afternoon for i have much to tellyou</s> tell me at once she said sitting down</s> i have discovered an ms</s>  at the library of the arsenal this morning thatno one knew anything about</s> he said this with an air of triumph as though the achievement were ofnational importance</s>  susie had a tenderness for his innocent mania andthough she knew the work in question was occult and incomprehensiblecongratulated him heartily</s> it is the original version of a book by paracelsus</s>  i have not read ityet for the writing is most difficult to decipher but one point caughtmy eye on turning over the pages</s>  that is the gruesome fact thatparacelsus fed the homunculi he manufactured on human blood</s>  onewonders how he came by it</s> susie gave a little start which dr porhot noticed</s> what is the matter with you</s> nothing she said quickly</s> he looked at her for a moment then proceeded with the subject thatstrangely fascinated him</s> you must let me take you one day to the library of the arsenal</s>  thereis no richer collection in the world of books dealing with the occultsciences</s>  and of course you know that it was at the arsenal that thetribunal sat under the suggestive name of chambre ardente to dealwith cases of sorcery and magic</s> i didnt smiled susie</s> i always think that these manuscripts and queer old books which arethe pride of our library served in many an old trial</s>  there are volumesthere of innocent appearance that have hanged wretched men and sentothers to the stake</s>  you would not believe how many persons of fortunerank and intelligence during the great reign of louis xiv immersedthemselves in these satanic undertakings</s> susie did not answer</s>  she could not now deal with these matters in anindifferent spirit</s>  everything she heard might have some bearing on thecircumstances which she had discussed with dr porhot times out ofnumber</s>  she had never been able to pin him down to an affirmation offaith</s>  certain strange things had manifestly happened but what theexplanation of them was no man could say</s>  he offered analogies fromhis wellstored memory</s>  he gave her books to read till she was saturatedwith occult science</s>  at one moment she was inclined to throw them allaside impatiently and at another was ready to believe that everythingwas possible</s> dr porhot stood up and stretched out a meditative finger</s>  he spoke inthat agreeably academic manner which at the beginning of theiracquaintance had always entertained susie because it contrasted soabsurdly with his fantastic utterances</s> it was a strange dream that these wizards cherished</s>  they sought to makethemselves beloved of those they cared for and to revenge themselves onthose they hated but above all they sought to become greater than thecommon run of men and to wield the power of the gods</s>  they hesitated atnothing to gain their ends</s>  but nature with difficulty allows her secretsto be wrested from her</s>  in vain they lit their furnaces and in vain theystudied their crabbed books called up the dead and conjured ghastlyspirits</s>  their reward was disappointment and wretchedness poverty thescorn of men torture imprisonment and shameful death</s>  and yet perhapsafter all there may be some particle of truth hidden away in these darkplaces</s> you never go further than the cautious perhaps said susie</s>  you nevergive me any definite opinion</s> in these matters it is discreet to have no definite opinion he smiledwith a shrug of the shoulders</s>  if a wise man studies the science of theoccult his duty is not to laugh at everything but to seek patientlyslowly perseveringly the truth that may be concealed in the night ofthese illusions</s> the words were hardly spoken when matilde the ancient bonne openedthe door to let a visitor come in</s>  it was arthur burdon</s>  susie gave a cryof surprise for she had received a brief note from him two days beforeand he had said nothing of crossing the channel</s> im glad to find you both here said arthur as he shook hands withthem</s> has anything happened</s>  cried susie</s> his manner was curiously distressing and there was a nervousness abouthis movements that was very unexpected in so restrained a person</s> ive seen margaret again he said</s> well</s> he seemed unable to go on and yet both knew that he had somethingimportant to tell them</s>  he looked at them vacantly as though all he hadto say was suddenly gone out of his mind</s> ive come straight here he said in a dull bewildered fashion</s>  iwent to your hotel susie in the hope of finding you but when they toldme you were out i felt certain you would be here</s> you seem worn out cher ami said dr porhot looking at him</s>  willyou let matilde make you a cup of coffee</s> i should like something he answered with a look of utter weariness</s> sit still for a minute or two and you shall tell us what you want towhen you are a little rested</s> dr porhot had not seen arthur since that afternoon in the previous yearwhen in answer to haddos telegram he had gone to the studio in the ruecampagne premire</s>  he watched him anxiously while arthur drank hiscoffee</s>  the change in him was extraordinary there was a cadaverousexhaustion about his face and his eyes were sunken in their sockets</s>  butwhat alarmed the good doctor most was that arthurs personality seemedthoroughly thrown out of gear</s>  all that he had endured during these ninemonths had robbed him of the strength of purpose the matteroffactsureness which had distinguished him</s>  he was now unbalanced andneurotic</s> arthur did not speak</s>  with his eyes fixed moodily on the ground hewondered how much he could bring himself to tell them</s>  it revolted himto disclose his inmost thoughts yet he was come to the end of his tetherand needed the doctors advice</s>  he found himself obliged to deal withcircumstances that might have existed in a world of nightmare and hewas driven at last to take advantage of his friends peculiar knowledge</s> returning to london after margarets flight arthur burdon had thrownhimself again into the work which for so long had been his only solace</s> it had lost its savour but he would not take this into account and heslaved away mechanically by perpetual toil seeking to deaden hisanguish</s>  but as the time passed he was seized on a sudden with a curiousfeeling of foreboding which he could in no way resist it grew instrength till it had all the power of an obsession and he could notreason himself out of it</s>  he was sure that a great danger threatenedmargaret</s>  he could not tell what it was nor why the fear of it was sopersistent but the idea was there always night and day it haunted himlike a shadow and pursued him like remorse</s>  his anxiety increasedcontinually and the vagueness of his terror made it more tormenting</s>  hefelt quite certain that margaret was in imminent peril but he did notknow how to help her</s>  arthur supposed that haddo had taken her back toskene but even if he went there he had no chance of seeing her</s>  whatmade it more difficult still was that his chief at st lukes was awayand he was obliged to be in london in case he should be suddenly calledupon to do some operation</s>  but he could think of nothing else</s>  he feltit urgently needful to see margaret</s>  night after night he dreamed thatshe was at the point of death and heavy fetters prevented him fromstretching out a hand to help her</s>  at last he could stand it no more</s>  hetold a brother surgeon that private business forced him to leave londonand put the work into his hands</s>  with no plan in his head merely urgedby an obscure impulse he set out for the village of venning which wasabout three miles from skene</s> it was a tiny place with one publichouse serving as a hotel to the raretravellers who found it needful to stop there and arthur felt that someexplanation of his presence was necessary</s>  having seen at the station anadvertisement of a large farm to let he told the inquisitive landladythat he had come to see it</s>  he arrived late at night</s>  nothing could bedone then so he occupied the time by trying to find out something aboutthe haddos</s> oliver was the local magnate and his wealth would have made him an easytopic of conversation even without his eccentricity</s>  the landlady roundlycalled him insane and as an instance of his queerness told arthur tohis great dismay that haddo would have no servants to sleep in thehouse after dinner everyone was sent away to the various cottages inthe park and he remained alone with his wife</s>  it was an awful thoughtthat margaret might be in the hands of a raving madman with not a soulto protect her</s>  but if he learnt no more than this of solid fact arthurheard much that was significant</s>  to his amazement the old fear of thewizard had grown up again in that lonely place and the garrulous womangravely told him of haddos evil influence on the crops and cattle offarmers who had aroused his anger</s>  he had had an altercation with hisbailiff and the man had died within a year</s>  a small freeholder in theneighbourhood had refused to sell the land which would have rounded offthe estate of skene and a disease had attacked every animal on his farmso that he was ruined</s>  arthur was impressed because though she reportedthese rumours with mock scepticism as the stories of ignorant yokels andold women the innkeeper had evidently a terrified belief in their truth</s> no one could deny that haddo had got possession of the land he wantedfor when it was put up to auction no one would bid against him and hebought it for a song</s> as soon as he could do so naturally arthur asked after margaret</s>  thewoman shrugged her shoulders</s>  no one knew anything about her</s>  she nevercame out of the park gates but sometimes you could see her wanderingabout inside by herself</s>  she saw no one</s>  haddo had long since quarrelledwith the surrounding gentry and though one old lady the mother of aneighbouring landowner had called when margaret first came she had notbeen admitted and the visit was never returned</s> shell come to no good poor lady said the hostess of the inn</s>  andthey do say shes a perfect picture to look at</s> arthur went to his room</s>  he longed for the day to come</s>  there was nocertain means of seeing margaret</s>  it was useless to go to the park gatessince even the tradesmen were obliged to leave their goods at the lodgebut it appeared that she walked alone morning and afternoon and itmight be possible to see her then</s>  he decided to climb into the park andwait till he came upon her in some spot where they were not likely tobe observed</s> next day the great heat of the last week was gone and the melancholy skywas dark with lowering clouds</s>  arthur inquired for the road which led toskene and set out to walk the three miles which separated him from it</s> the country was grey and barren</s>  there was a broad waste of heath withgigantic boulders strewn as though in prehistoric times titans had wagedthere a mighty battle</s>  here and there were trees but they seemed hardlyto withstand the fierce winds of winter they were old and bowed beforethe storm</s>  one of them attracted his attention</s>  it had been struck bylightning and was riven asunder leafless but the maimed branches werecuriously set on the trunk so that they gave it the appearance of a humanbeing writhing in the torture of infernal agony</s>  the wind whistledstrangely</s>  arthurs heart sank as he walked on</s>  he had never seen acountry so desolate</s> he came to the park gates at last and stood for some time in front ofthem</s>  at the end of a long avenue among the trees he could see part ofa splendid house</s>  he walked along the wooden palisade that surrounded thepark</s>  suddenly he came to a spot where a board had been broken down</s>  helooked up and down the road</s>  no one was in sight</s>  he climbed up the lowsteep bank wrenched down a piece more of the fence and slipped in</s> he found himself in a dense wood</s>  there was no sign of a path and headvanced cautiously</s>  the bracken was so thick and high that it easilyconcealed him</s>  dead owners had plainly spent much care upon the placefor here alone in the neighbourhood were trees in abundance but of lateit had been utterly neglected</s>  it had run so wild that there were notraces now of its early formal arrangement and it was so hard to makeones way the vegetation was so thick that it might almost have beensome remnant of primeval forest</s>  but at last he came to a grassy path andwalked along it slowly</s>  he stopped on a sudden for he heard a sound</s>  butit was only a pheasant that flew heavily through the low trees</s>  hewondered what he should do if he came face to face with oliver</s>  theinnkeeper had assured him that the squire seldom came out but spent hisdays locked in the great attics at the top of the house</s>  smoke came fromthe chimneys of them even in the hottest days of summer and weird taleswere told of the devilries there committed</s> arthur went on hoping in the end to catch sight of margaret but hesaw no one</s>  in that grey chilly day the woods notwithstanding theirgreenery were desolate and sad</s>  a sombre mystery seemed to hang overthem</s>  at last he came to a stone bench at a crossway among the treesand since it was the only restingplace he had seen it struck him thatmargaret might come there to sit down</s>  he hid himself in the bracken</s> he had forgotten his watch and did not know how the time passed heseemed to be there for hours</s> but at length his heart gave a great beat against his ribs for all atonce so silently that he had not heard her approach margaret came intoview</s>  she sat on the stone bench</s>  for a moment he dared not move in casethe sound frightened her</s>  he could not tell how to make his presenceknown</s>  but it was necessary to do something to attract her attentionand he could only hope that she would not cry out</s> margaret he called softly</s> she did not move and he repeated her name more loudly</s>  but still shemade no sign that she had heard</s>  he came forward and stood in front ofher</s> margaret</s> she looked at

she answered placidly</s> he was so taken aback that he did not know what to say</s>  she kept gazingat him steadfastly</s>  on a sudden her calmness vanished and she sprang toher feet</s> is it you

with the blackarts are unanimous upon the supreme efficacy of the virginal condition</s> but what is to be done</s>  asked arthur is desperation</s>  we cant leaveher in the hands of a raving madman</s>  he turned on a sudden deathlywhite</s>  for all we know she may be dead now</s>
 said dr porhot continuing hisreflections</s>  that is the classic instance of human sacrifice</s>  i know thecountry in which he lived and the peasants to this day dare not pass atnight in the

porhot</s> and if we wait too long we may be faced by a terrible catastrophe</s> fortunately we live in a civilized age</s>  haddo has a great care of hisneck</s>  i hope we are frightened unduly</s> it seemed to susie that the chief thing was to distract arthur and sheturned over in her mind some means of directing his attention to othermatters</s> i was thinking of going down to chartres for two days with mrsbloomfield she said</s>  wont you come with me</s>  it is the most lovelycathedral in the world and i think you will find it restful to wanderabout it for a little while</s>  you can do no good here or in london</s> perhaps when you are calm you will be able to think of somethingpractical</s> dr porhot saw what her plan was and joined his entreaties to hers thatarthur should spend a day or two in a place that had no associations forhim</s>  arthur was too exhausted to argue and from sheer wearinessconsented</s>  next day susie took him to chartres</s>  mrs bloomfield was notrouble to them and susie induced him to linger for a week in thatpleasant quiet town</s>  they passed many hours in the stately cathedraland they wandered about the surrounding country</s>  arthur

idaresay something can be done</s>  if hes really mad well have to put himunder restraint and margaret will be free</s>  i shall never forget yourkindness</s> susie smiled and shrugged her

cardiacdiseases is neither extensive nor peculiar</s>  but this was a very simplecase and everything was done that was possible</s>  i dont think theresanything i can tell you</s> arthur took no notice of the outburst</s> how many times did you see her</s> really sir i dont understand your attitude</s>  i cant see that you haveany right to question me</s> did you have a postmortem</s> certainly not</s>  in the first place there was no need as the cause ofdeath was perfectly clear and secondly you must know as well as i dothat the relatives are very averse to anything of the sort</s>  you gentlemenin harley street dont understand the conditions of private practice</s>  wehavent the time to do postmortems to gratify a needless curiosity</s> arthur was silent for a moment</s>  the little man was evidently convincedthat there was nothing odd about margarets death but his foolishnesswas as great as his obstinacy</s>  it was clear that several motives wouldinduce him to put every obstacle in arthurs way and chief of thesewas the harm it would do him if it were discovered that he had given acertificate of death carelessly</s>  he would naturally do anything to avoidsocial scandal</s>  still arthur was obliged to speak</s> i think id better tell you frankly that im not satisfied drrichardson</s>  i cant persuade myself that this ladys death was dueto natural

childish</s>  you tell me that you are a surgeon of someeminence </s> </s> </s> i surely told you nothing of the sort</s> anyhow you read papers before learned bodies and have them printed</s> and you come with as silly a story as a staffordshire peasant who thinkssomeone has been trying to poison him because hes got a stomachache</s> you may be a very admirable surgeon but i venture to think i am morecapable than you of judging in a case which i attended and you knownothing about</s> i mean to take the steps necessary to get an order for exhumation drrichardson and i cannot help thinking it

susie and dr porhot walkedout and arthur looking down thoughtfully followed on their heels</s>  drrichardson slammed the streetdoor angrily</s> dr porhot slipped his arm in arthurs</s> you must be reasonable my friend he said</s>  from his own point of viewthis doctor has all the rights on his side</s>  you have nothing to justifyyour demands</s>  it is monstrous to expect that for a vague suspicion youwill be able to get an order for exhumation</s> arthur did not answer</s>  the trap was waiting for them</s> why do you want to see haddo</s>  insisted the doctor</s>  you will do no moregood than you have with dr richardson</s> i have made up my mind to see him answered arthur shortly</s>  but thereis no need that either of you should accompany me</s> if you go we will come with you said susie</s> without a word arthur jumped into the dogcart and susie took a seat byhis side</s>  dr porhot with a shrug of the shoulders mounted behind</s> arthur whipped up the pony and at a smart trot they traversed the threemiles across the barren heath that lay between venning and skene</s> when they reached the park gates the lodgekeeper as luck would have itwas standing just inside and she held one of them open for her littleboy to come in</s>  he was playing in the road and showed no inclination todo so</s>  arthur jumped down</s> i want to see mr haddo he said</s> mr haddos not in she answered roughly</s> she tried to close the gate but arthur quickly put his foot inside</s> nonsense</s>  i have to see him on a matter of great importance</s> mr haddos orders are that no

of here cried the woman</s>  youre not coming inwhatever you say</s> she tried to push the gate to but arthurs foot prevented her</s>  paying noheed to her angry expostulations he forced his way

door but you wont see mr haddo the woman criedangrily</s>  youll get me sacked for letting you come</s> susie saw the house</s>  it was a fine old building in the elizabethan stylebut much in need of repair and it had the desolate look of a place thathas been uninhabited</s>  the garden that surrounded it had been allowed torun wild and the avenue up which they walked was green with rank weeds</s> here and there a fallen tree which none had troubled to remove markedthe owners negligence</s>  arthur went to the door and rang a bell</s>  theyheard it clang through the house as though not a soul lived there</s>  a mancame to the door and as soon as he opened it arthur expecting to berefused admission pushed in</s>  the fellow was as angry as the virago hiswife who explained noisily how the three strangers had got into thepark</s> you cant see the squire so youd better be off</s>  hes up in the atticsand no ones allowed to go to him</s> the man tried to push arthur away</s> be off with you or ill send for the police</s> dont be a fool said arthur</s>  i mean to find mr haddo</s> the housekeeper and his wife broke out with abuse to which arthurlistened in silence</s>  susie and dr porhot stood by anxiously</s>  they didnot know what to do</s>  suddenly a voice at their elbows made them startand the two servants were immediately silent</s> what can i do for you</s> oliver haddo was standing motionless behind them</s>  it startled susie thathe should have come upon them so suddenly without a sound</s>  dr porhotwho had not seen him for some time was astounded at the change which hadtaken place in him</s>  the corpulence which had been his before was becomenow a positive disease</s>  he was enormous</s>  his chin was a mass of heavyfolds distended with fat and his cheeks were puffed up so that his eyeswere preternaturally small</s>  he peered at you from between the swollenlids</s>  all his features had sunk into that hideous obesity</s>  his ears werehorribly bloated and the lobes were large and swelled</s>  he had apparentlya difficulty in breathing for his large mouth with its scarlet shininglips was constantly open</s>  he had grown much balder and now there wasonly a crescent of long hair stretching across the back of his head fromear to ear</s>  there was something terrible about that great shining scalp</s> his paunch was huge he was a very tall man and held himself erect sothat it protruded like a vast barrel</s>  his hands were infinitelyrepulsive they were red and soft and moist</s>  he was sweating freely andbeads of perspiration stood on his forehead and on his shaven lip</s> for a moment they all looked at one another in silence</s>  then haddo turnedto his servants</s> go he said</s> as though frightened out of their wits they made for the door and with abustling hurry flung themselves out</s>  a torpid smile crossed his face ashe watched them go</s>  then he moved a step nearer his visitors</s>  his mannerhad still the insolent urbanity which was customary to him</s> and now my friends will you tell me how i can be of service to you</s> i have come about margarets death said arthur</s> haddo as was his habit did not immediately answer</s>  he looked slowlyfrom arthur to dr porhot and from dr porhot to susie</s>  his eyes restedon her hat and she felt uncomfortably that he was inventing some gibeabout it</s> i should have thought this hardly the moment to intrude upon my sorrowhe said at last</s>  if you have condolences to offer i venture to suggestthat you might conveniently send them by means of the penny post</s> arthur frowned</s> why did you not let me know that she was ill</s>  he asked</s> strange as it may seem to you my worthy friend it never occurred to methat my wifes health could be any business of yours</s> a faint smile flickered once more on haddos lips but his eyes had stillthe peculiar hardness which was so uncanny</s>  arthur looked at himsteadily</s> i have every reason to believe that you killed her he said</s> haddos face did not for an instant change its expression</s> and have you communicated your suspicions to the police</s> i propose to</s> and if i am not indiscreet may i inquire upon what you base them</s> i saw margaret three weeks ago and she told me that she went in terrorof her life</s> poor margaret</s>  she had always the romantic temperament</s>  i think it wasthat which first brought us together</s> you damned scoundrel</s>  cried arthur</s> my dear fellow pray moderate your language</s>  this is surely not anoccasion when you should give way to your lamentable taste for abuse</s>  yououtrage all miss boyds susceptibilities</s>  he turned to her with an airywave of his fat hand</s>  you must forgive me if i do not offer you thehospitality of skene but the loss i have so lately sustained does notpermit me to indulge in the levity of entertaining</s>
if i can be of no further use to you perhaps you would leave me to myown reflections</s>  the lodgekeeper will give you the exact address of thevillage constable</s> arthur did not answer</s>  he stared into vacancy as if he were turning overthings in his mind</s>  then he turned sharply on his heel and walked towardsthe gate</s>  susie and dr porhot taken completely aback did not know whatto do and haddos little eyes twinkled as he watched their discomfiture</s> i always thought that your friend had deplorable manners he murmured</s> susie feeling very ridiculous flushed and dr porhot awkwardly tookoff his hat</s>  as they walked away they felt haddos mocking gaze fixedupon them and they were heartily thankful to reach the gate</s>  they foundarthur waiting for them</s> i beg your pardon he said i forgot that i was not alone</s> the three of them drove slowly back to the inn</s> what are you going to do now</s>  asked susie</s> for a long time arthur made no reply and susie thought he could not haveheard her</s>  at last he broke the silence</s> i see that i can do nothing by ordinary methods</s>  i realize that it isuseless to make a public outcry</s>  there is only my own conviction thatmargaret came to a violent end and i cannot expect anyone to pay heed tothat</s> after all its just possible that she really died of heart disease</s> arthur gave susie a long look</s>  he seemed to consider her wordsdeliberately</s> perhaps there are means to decide that conclusively he replied atlength thoughtfully as though he were talking to himself</s> what are they</s> arthur did not answer</s>  when they came to the door of the inn he stopped</s> will you go in</s>  i wish to take a walk by myself he said</s> susie looked at him anxiously</s> youre not going to do anything rash</s> i will do nothing till i have made quite sure that margaret was foullymurdered</s> he turned on his heel and walked quickly away</s>  it was late now and theyfound a frugal meal waiting for them in the little sittingroom</s>  itseemed no use to delay it till arthur came back and silentlysorrowfully they ate</s>  afterwards the doctor smoked cigarettes whilesusie sat at the open window and looked at the stars</s>  she thought ofmargaret of her beauty and her charming frankness of her fall and ofher miserable end and she began to cry quietly</s>  she knew enough of thefacts now to be aware that the wretched girl was not to blame foranything that had happened</s>  a cruel fate had fallen upon her and she hadbeen as powerless as in the old tales phaedra the daughter of minos ormyrrha of the beautiful hair</s>  the hours passed and still arthur did notreturn</s>  susie thought now only of him and she was frightfully anxious</s> but at last he came in</s>  the night was far advanced</s>  he put down his hatand sat down</s>  for a long while he looked silently at dr</s>  porhot</s> what is it my friend</s>  asked the good doctor at length</s> do you remember that you told us once of an experiment you made inalexandria</s>  he said after some hesitation</s> he spoke in a curious voice</s> you told us that you took a boy and when he looked in a magic mirrorhe saw things which he could not possibly have known</s> i remember very well said the doctor</s> i was much inclined to laugh at you at the time</s>  i was convinced thatthe boy was a knave who deceived you</s> yes</s> of late ive thought of that story often</s>  some hidden recess of mymemory has been opened and i seem to remember strange things</s>  was ithe boy who looked in the ink</s> yes said the doctor quietly</s> arthur did not say anything</s>  a profound silence fell upon them whilesusie and the doctor watched him intently</s>  they wondered what was in hismind</s> there is a side of my character which i did not know till latelyarthur said at last</s>  when first it dawned upon me i fought against it</s> i said to myself that deep down in all of us a relic from the long pastis the remains of the superstition that blinded our fathers and it isneedful for the man of science to fight against it with all his might</s> and yet it was stronger than i</s>  perhaps my birth my early years inthose eastern lands where everyone believes in the supernatural affectedme although i did not know it</s>  i began to remember vague mysteriousthings which i never knew had been part of my knowledge</s>  and at last oneday it seemed that a new window was opened on to my soul and i saw withextraordinary clearness the incident which you had described</s>  i knewsuddenly it was part of my own experience</s>  i saw you take me by the handand pour the ink on my palm and bid me look at it</s>  i felt again thestrange glow that thrilled me and with an indescribable bitterness i sawthings in the mirror which were not there before</s>  i saw people whom i hadnever seen</s>  i saw them perform certain actions</s>  and some force i knewnot obliged me to speak</s>  and at length everything grew dim and i was asexhausted as if i had not eaten all day</s> he went over to the open window and looked out</s>  neither of the othersspoke</s>  the look on arthurs face curiously outlined by the light of thelamp was very stern</s>  he seemed to undergo some mental struggle ofextraordinary violence</s>  he breath came quickly</s>  at last he turned andfaced them</s>  he spoke hoarsely quickly</s> i must see margaret again</s> arthur youre mad</s>  cried susie</s> he went up to dr porhot and putting his hands on his shoulders lookedfixedly into his eyes</s> you have studied this science</s>  you know all that can be known of it</s>  iwant you to show her to me</s> the doctor gave an exclamation of alarm</s> my dear fellow how can i</s>  i have read many books but i have neverpractised anything</s>  i have only studied these matters for my amusement</s> do you believe it can be done</s> i dont understand what you want</s> i want you to bring her to me so that i may speak with her so that imay find out the truth</s> do you think i am god that i can raise men from the dead</s> arthurs hands pressed him down in the chair from which he sought

even if you could bring her from thegrave for a moment why can you not let her troubled soul rest in peace</s> if she died a natural death we shall have no power over her but if herdeath was violent

books and i will do it alone</s> you know that i have nothing here</s> then you must help me said arthur</s>  after all why should you mind</s>  weperform a certain operation and if nothing happens we are no worse offthen before</s>  on the other hand if we succeed</s> </s> </s> </s>  oh for gods sakehelp me</s>  if you have any care for my happiness do this one thing for me</s> he stepped back and looked at the doctor</s>  the frenchmans eyes were fixedupon the ground</s> its madness he muttered</s> he was intensely moved by arthurs appeal</s>  at last he shrugged hisshoulders</s> after all if it is but a foolish mummery it can do no harm</s> you will help me</s>  cried arthur</s> if it can give you any peace or any satisfaction i am willing to dowhat i can</s>  but i warn you to be prepared for a great disappointment</s> 15arthur wished to set about the invocation then and there but dr porhotsaid it was impossible</s>  they were all exhausted after the long journeyand it was necessary to get certain things together without which nothingcould be done</s>  in his heart he thought that a nights rest would bringarthur to a more reasonable mind</s>  when the light of day shone upon theearth he would be ashamed of the desire which ran counter to all hisprepossessions</s>  but arthur remembered that on the next day it would beexactly a week since margarets death and it seemed to him that thentheir spells might have a greater efficacy</s> when they came down in the morning and greeted one another it was plainthat none of them had slept</s> are you still of the same purpose as last night</s>  asked dr porhotgravely</s> i am</s> the doctor hesitated nervously</s> it will be necessary if you wish to follow out the rules of the oldnecromancers to fast through the whole day</s> i am ready to do anything</s> it will be no hardship to me said susie with a little hystericallaugh</s>  i feel i couldnt eat a thing if i tried</s> i think the whole affair is sheer folly said dr porhot</s> you promised me you would try</s> the day the long summer day passed slowly</s>  there was a hard brilliancyin the sky that reminded the frenchman of those egyptian heavens whenthe earth seemed crushed beneath a bowl of molten fire</s>  arthur was toorestless to remain indoors and left the others to their own devices</s>  hewalked without aim as fast as he could go he felt no weariness</s>
 theburning sun beat down upon him but he did not know it</s>  the hours passedwith lagging feet</s>  susie lay on her bed and tried to read</s>  her nerveswere so taut that when there was a sound in the courtyard of a pailfalling on the cobbles she cried out in terror</s>  the sun rose andpresently her window was flooded with quivering rays of gold</s>
 it wasmidday</s>  the day passed and it was afternoon</s>  the evening came but itbrought no freshness</s>  meanwhile dr porhot sat in the little parlourwith his head between his hands trying by a great mental effort to bringback to his memory all that he had read</s>  his heart began to beat morequickly</s>  then the night fell and one by one the stars shone out</s>  therewas no wind</s>  the air was heavy</s>  susie came downstairs and began to talkwith dr porhot</s>  but they spoke in a low tone as if they were afraidthat someone would overhear</s>  they were faint now with want of food</s>  thehours went one by one and the striking of a clock filled them each timewith a mysterious apprehension</s>  the lights in the village were put outlittle by little and everybody slept</s>  susie had lighted the lamp andthey watched beside it</s>  a cold shiver passed through her</s> i feel as though someone were lying dead in the room she said</s> why does not arthur come</s> they spoke inconsequently and neither heeded what the other said</s>  thewindow was wide open but the air was difficult to breathe</s>  and now thesilence was so unusual that susie grew strangely nervous</s>  she tried tothink of the noisy streets in paris the constant roar of traffic andthe shuffling of the crowds toward evening as the work people returned totheir homes</s>  she stood up</s> theres no air tonight</s>  look at the trees</s>  not a leaf is moving</s> why does not arthur come</s>  repeated the doctor</s> theres no moon tonight</s>  it will be very dark at skene</s> hes walked all day</s>  he should be here by now</s> susie felt an extraordinary oppression and she panted for breath</s>  atlast they heard a step on the road outside and arthur stood at thewindow</s> are you ready to come</s>  he said</s> weve been waiting for you</s> they joined him bringing the few things that dr porhot had said werenecessary and they walked along the solitary road that led to skene</s> on each side the heather stretched into the dark night and there wasa blackness about it that was ominous</s>  there was no sound save that oftheir own steps</s>  dimly under the stars they saw the desolation withwhich they were surrounded</s>  the way seemed very long</s>  they were utterlyexhausted and they could hardly drag one foot after the other</s> you must let me rest for a minute said susie</s> they did not answer but stopped and she sat on a boulder by thewayside</s>  they stood motionless in front of her waiting patiently tillshe was ready</s>  after a little while she forced herself to get up</s> now i can go she said</s> still they did not speak but walked on</s>  they moved like figures ina dream with a stealthy directness as though they acted under theinfluence of anothers will</s>  suddenly the road stopped and they foundthemselves at the gates of skene</s> follow me very closely said arthur</s> he turned on one side and they followed a paling</s>  susie could feel thatthey walked along a narrow path</s>  she could see hardly two steps in frontof her</s>  at last he stood still</s> i came here earlier in the night and made the opening easier to getthrough</s> he turned back a broken piece of railing and slipped in</s>  susie followedand dr porhot entered after her</s> i can see nothing said susie</s> give my your hand and i will lead you</s> they walked with difficulty through the tangled bracken among closelyplanted trees</s>  they stumbled and once dr porhot fell</s>  it seemed thatthey went a long way</s>  susies heart beat fast with anxiety</s>  all herweariness was forgotten</s> then arthur stopped them and he pointed in front of him</s>  through anopening in the trees they saw the house</s>  all the windows were darkexcept those just under the roof and from them came bright lights</s> those are the attics which he uses as a laboratory</s>  you see he isworking now</s>  there is no one else in the house</s> susie was curiously fascinated by the flaming lights</s>  there was an awfulmystery in those unknown labours which absorbed oliver haddo night afternight till the sun rose</s>  what horrible things were done there hiddenfrom the eyes of men</s>  by himself in that vast house the madman performedghastly experiments and who could tell what dark secrets he traffickedin</s> there is no danger that he will come out said arthur</s>  he remainsthere till the break of day</s> he took her hand again and led her on</s>  back they went among the treesand presently they were on a pathway</s>  they walked along with greatersafety</s> are you all right porhot</s>  asked arthur</s> yes</s> but the trees grew thicker and the night more sombre</s>  now the stars wereshut out and they could hardly see in front of them</s> here we are said arthur</s> they stopped and found that there was in front of them a green spaceformed by four crossways</s>  in the middle a stone bench gleamed vaguelyagainst the darkness</s> this is where margaret sat when last i saw her</s> i can see to do nothing here said the doctor</s> they had brought two flat bowls of brass to serve as censers and thesearthur gave to dr porhot</s>  he stood by susies side while the doctorbusied himself with his preparations</s>  they saw him move to and fro</s>  theysaw him bend to the ground</s>  presently there was a crackling of wood andfrom the brazen bowls red flames shot up</s>  they did not know what heburnt but there were heavy clouds of smoke and a strong aromaticodour filled the air</s>  now and again the doctor was sharply silhouettedagainst the light</s>  his slight bowed figure was singularly mysterious</s> when susie caught sight of his face she saw that it was touched with astrong emotion</s>  the work he was at affected him so that his doubts hisfears had vanished</s>  he looked like some old alchemist busied withunnatural things</s>  susies heart began to beat painfully</s>  she was growingdesperately frightened and stretched out her hand so that she might toucharthur</s>  silently he put his arm through hers</s>  and now the doctor wastracing strange signs upon the ground</s>  the flames died down and only aglow remained but he seemed to have no difficulty in seeing what he wasabout</s>  susie could not discern what figures he drew</s>  then he put moretwigs upon the braziers and the flames sprang up once more cutting thedarkness sharply as with a sword</s> now come he said</s> but inexplicably a sudden terror seized susie</s>  she felt that the hairsof her head stood up and a cold sweat broke out on her body</s>  her limbshad grown on an instant inconceivably heavy so that she could not move</s> a panic such as she had never known came upon her and except that herlegs would not carry her she would have fled blindly</s>  she began totremble</s>  she tried to speak but her tongue clave to her throat</s> i cant im afraid she muttered hoarsely</s> you must</s>  without you we can do nothing said arthur</s> she could not reason with herself</s>  she had forgotten everything exceptthat she was frightened to death</s>  her heart was beating so quickly thatshe almost fainted</s>  and now arthur held her so firmly that she winced</s> let me go she whispered</s>  i wont help you</s>  im afraid</s> you must he said</s>  you must</s> no</s> i tell you you must come</s> why</s> her deadly fear expressed itself in a passion of sudden anger</s> because you love me and its the only way to give me peace</s> she uttered a low wail of pain and her terror gave way to shame</s>  sheblushed to the roots of her hair because he too knew her secret</s>  and thenshe was seized again with anger because he had the cruelty to taunt herwith it</s>  she had recovered her courage now and she stepped forward</s>  dr</s> porhot told her where to stand</s>  arthur took his place in front of her</s> you must not move till i give you leave</s>  if you go outside the figure ihave drawn i cannot protect you</s> for a moment dr porhot stood in perfect silence</s>  then he began to recitestrange words in latin</s>  susie heard him but vaguely</s>  she did not know thesense and his voice was so low that she could not have distinguished thewords</s>  but his intonation had lost that gentle irony which was habitualto him and he spoke with a trembling gravity that was extraordinarilyimpressive</s>  arthur stood immobile as a rock</s>  the flames died away andthey saw one another only by the glow of the ashes dimly like personsin a vision of death</s>  there was silence</s>  then the necromancer spokeagain and now his voice was louder</s>  he seemed to utter weirdinvocations but they were in a tongue that the others knew not</s>  andwhile he spoke the light from the burning cinders on a sudden went out</s> it did not die but was sharply extinguished as though by invisiblehands</s>  and now the darkness was more sombre than that of the blackestnight</s>  the trees that surrounded them were hidden from their eyes andthe whiteness of the stone bench was seen no longer</s>  they stood but alittle way one from the other but each might have stood alone</s>  susiestrained her eyes but she could see nothing</s>  she looked up quicklythe stars were gone out and she could see no further over her head thanround about</s>  the darkness was terrifying</s>  and from it dr porhots voicehad a ghastly effect</s>  it seemed to come wonderfully changed from thevoid of bottomless chaos</s>  susie clenched her hands so that she might notfaint</s> all at once she started for the old mans voice was cut by a sudden gustof wind</s>  a moment before the utter silence had been almost intolerableand now a storm seemed to have fallen upon them</s>  the trees all aroundthem rocked in the wind they heard the branches creak and they heardthe hissing of the leaves</s>  they were in the midst of a hurricane</s>  andthey felt the earth sway as it resisted the straining roots of greattrees which seemed to be dragged up by the force of the furious gale</s> whistling and roaring the wind stormed all about them and the doctorraising his voice tried in vain to command it</s>  but the strangest thingof all was that where they stood there was no sign of the raging blast</s> the air immediately about them was as still as it had been before andnot a hair on susies head was moved</s>  and it was terrible to hear thetumult and yet to be in a calm that was almost unnatural</s> on a sudden dr porhot raised his voice and with a sternness they hadnever heard in it before cried out in that unknown language</s>  then hecalled upon margaret</s>  he called her name three times</s>  in the uproar susiecould scarcely hear</s>  terror had seized her again but in her confusionshe remembered his command and she dared not move</s> margaret margaret margaret</s> without a pause between as quickly as a stone falls to the ground thedin which was all about them ceased</s>  there was no gradual diminution</s>  butat one moment there was a roaring hurricane and at the next a silence socomplete that it might have been the silence of death</s> and then seeming to come out of nothingness extraordinarily they heardwith a curious distinctness the sound of a woman weeping</s>  susies heartstood still</s>  they heard the sound of a woman weeping and they recognizedthe voice of margaret</s>  a groan of anguish burst from arthurs lips andhe was on the point of starting forward</s>  but quickly dr porhot put outhis hand to prevent him</s>  the sound was heartrending the sobbing of awoman who had lost all hope the sobbing of a woman terrified</s>  if susiehad been able to stir she would have put her hands to her ears to shutout the ghastly agony of it</s> and in a moment notwithstanding the heavy darkness of the starlessnight arthur saw her</s>  she was seated on the stone bench as when last hehad spoken with her</s>  in her anguish she sought not to hide her face</s>  shelooked at the ground and the tears fell down her cheeks</s>  her bosomheaved with the pain of her weeping</s> then arthur knew that all his suspicions were justified</s> 16arthur would not leave the little village of venning</s>  neither susie northe doctor could get him to make any decision</s>  none of them spoke of thenight which they had spent in the woods of skene but it coloured alltheir thoughts and they were not free for a single moment from theghastly memory of it</s>  they seemed still to hear the sound of thatpassionate weeping</s>  arthur was moody</s>  when he was with them he spokelittle he opposed a stubborn resistance to their efforts at divertinghis mind</s>  he spent long hours by himself in the country and they had noidea what he did</s>  susie was terribly anxious</s>  he had lost his balance socompletely that she was prepared for any rashness</s>  she divined that hishatred of haddo was no longer within the bounds of reason</s>  the desire forvengeance filled him entirely so that he was capable of any violence</s> several days went by</s> at last in concert with dr porhot she determined to make one moreattempt</s>  it was late at night and they sat with open windows in thesittingroom of the inn</s>  there was a singular oppressiveness in the airwhich suggested that a thunderstorm was at hand</s>  susie prayed for it forshe ascribed to the peculiar heat of the last few days much of arthurssullen irritability</s> arthur you must tell us what you are going to do she said</s>  itis useless to stay here</s>  we are all so ill and nervous that we cannotconsider anything rationally</s>  we want you to come away with us tomorrow</s> you can go if you choose he said</s>  i shall remain till that man isdead</s> it is madness to talk like that</s>  you can do nothing</s>  you are only makingyourself worse by staying here</s> i have quite made up my mind</s> the law can offer you no help and what else can you do</s> she asked the question meaning if possible to get from him some hint ofhis intentions but the grimness of his answer though it only confirmedher vague suspicions startled her</s> if i can do nothing else i shall shoot him like a dog</s> she could think of nothing to say and for a while they remained insilence</s>  then he got up</s> i think i should prefer it if you went he said</s>  you can only hamperme</s> i shall stay here as long as you do</s> why</s> because if you do anything i shall be compromised</s>  i may be arrested</s>  ithink the fear of that may restrain you</s> he looked at her steadily</s>  she met his eyes with a calmness whichshowed that she meant exactly what she said and he turned uneasilyaway</s>  a silence even greater than before fell upon them</s>  they did notmove</s>  it was so still in the room that it might have been empty</s>  thebreathlessness of the air increased so that it was horribly oppressive</s> suddenly there was a loud rattle of thunder and a flash of lightningtore across the heavy clouds</s>  susie thanked heaven for the storm whichwould give presently a welcome freshness</s>  she felt excessively ill atease and it was a relief to ascribe her sensation to a state of theatmosphere</s>  again the thunder rolled</s>  it was so loud that it seemed tobe immediately above their heads</s>  and the wind rose suddenly and sweptwith a long moan through the trees that surrounded the house</s>  it was asound so human that it might have come from the souls of dead mensuffering hopeless torments of regret</s> the lamp went out so suddenly that susie was vaguely frightened</s>  it gaveone flicker and they were in total darkness</s>  it seemed as though someonehad leaned over the chimney and blown it out</s>  the night was very blackand they could not see the window which opened on to the country</s>  thedarkness was so peculiar that for a moment no one stirred</s> then susie heard dr porhot slip his hand across the table to findmatches but it seemed that they were not there</s>  again a loud peal ofthunder startled them but the rain would not fall</s>  they panted for freshair</s>  on a sudden susies heart gave a bound and she sprang up</s> theres someone in the room</s> the words were no sooner out of her mouth than she heard arthur flinghimself upon the intruder</s>  she knew at once with the certainty of anintuition that it was haddo</s>  but how had he come in</s>  what did he want</s> she tried to cry out but no sound came from her throat</s>  dr porhotseemed bound to his chair</s>  he did not move</s>  he made no sound</s>  she knewthat an awful struggle was proceeding</s>  it was a struggle to the deathbetween two men who hated one another but the most terrible part of itwas that nothing was heard</s>  they were perfectly noiseless</s>  she tried todo something but she could not stir</s>  and arthurs heart exulted for hisenemy was in his grasp under his hands and he would not let him gowhile life was in him</s>  he clenched his teeth and tightened his strainingmuscles</s>  susie heard his laboured breathing but she only heard thebreathing of one man</s>  she wondered in abject terror what that could mean</s> they struggled silently hand to hand and arthur knew that his strengthwas greater</s>  he had made up his mind what to do and directed all hisenergy to a definite end</s>  his enemy was extraordinarily powerful butarthur appeared to create some strength from the sheer force of his will</s> it seemed for hours that they struggled</s>  he could not bear him down</s> suddenly he knew that the other was frightened and sought to escape fromhim</s>  arthur tightened his grasp for nothing in the world now would heever loosen his hold</s>  he took a deep quick breath and then put out allhis strength in a tremendous effort</s>  they swayed from side to side</s> arthur felt as if his muscles were being torn from the bones he couldnot continue for more than a moment longer but the agony that flashedacross his mind at the thought of failure braced him to a sudden angryjerk</s>  all at once haddo collapsed and they fell heavily to the ground</s> arthur was breathing more quickly now</s>  he thought that if he could keepon for one instant longer he would be safe</s>  he threw all his weight onthe form that rolled beneath him and bore down furiously on the mansarm</s>  he twisted it sharply with all his might and felt it give way</s>  hegave a low cry of triumph the arm was broken</s>  and now his enemy wasseized with panic he struggled madly he wanted only to get away fromthose long hands that were killing him</s>  they seemed to be of iron</s>  arthurseized the huge bullock throat and dug his fingers into it and they sunkinto the heavy rolls of fat and he flung the whole weight of his bodyinto them</s>  he exulted for he knew that his enemy was in his power atlast he was strangling him strangling the life out of him</s>  he wantedlight so that he might see the horror of that vast face and the deadlyfear and the staring eyes</s>  and still he pressed with those iron hands</s> and now the movements were strangely convulsive</s>  his victim writhed inthe agony of death</s>  his struggles were desperate but the avenging handsheld him as in a vice</s>  and then the movements grew spasmodic and thenthey grew weaker</s>  still the hands pressed upon the gigantic throat andarthur forgot everything</s>  he was mad with rage and fury and hate andsorrow</s>  he thought of margarets anguish and of her fiendish torture andhe wished the man had ten lives so that he might take them one by one</s> and at last all was still and that vast mass of flesh was motionlessand he knew that his enemy was dead</s>  he loosened his grasp and slippedone hand over the heart</s>  it would never beat again</s>  the man was stonedead</s>  arthur got up and straightened himself</s>  the darkness was intensestill and he could see nothing</s>  susie heard him and at length she wasable to speak</s> arthur what have you done</s> ive killed him he said hoarsely</s> o god what shall we do</s> arthur began to laugh aloud hysterically and in the darkness hishilarity was terrifying</s> for gods sake let us have some light</s> ive found the matches said dr porhot</s> he seemed to awake suddenly from his long stupor</s>  he struck one and itwould not light</s>  he struck another and susie took off the globe and thechimney as he kindled the wick</s>  then he held up the lamp and they sawarthur looking at them</s>  his face was ghastly</s>  the sweat ran off hisforehead in great beads and his eyes were bloodshot</s>  he trembled inevery limb</s>  then dr porhot advanced with the lamp and held it forward</s> they looked down on the floor for the man who lay there dead</s>  susie gavea sudden cry of horror</s> there was no one there</s> arthur stepped back in terrified surprise</s>  there was no one in the roomliving or dead but the three friends</s>  the ground sank under susiesfeet she felt horribly ill and she fainted</s>  when she awoke seemingdifficultly to emerge from an eternal night arthur was holding down herhead</s> bend down he said</s>  bend down</s> all that had happened came back to her and she burst into tears</s>  herselfcontrol deserted her and clinging to him for protection shesobbed as though her heart would break</s>  she was shaking from head tofoot</s>  the strangeness of this last horror had overcome her and she couldhave shrieked with fright</s> its all right he said</s>  you need not be afraid</s> oh what does it mean</s> you must pluck up courage</s>  were going now to skene</s> she sprang to her feet as though to get away from him her heart beatwildly</s> no i cant im frightened</s> we must see what it means</s>  we have no time to lose or the morning willbe upon us before we get back</s> then she sought to prevent him</s> oh for gods sake dont go arthur</s>  something awful may await youthere</s>  dont risk your life</s> there is no danger</s>  i tell you the man is dead</s> if anything happened to you </s> </s> </s> she stopped trying to restrain her sobs she dared not go on</s>  but heseemed to know what was in her mind</s> i will take no risks because of you</s>  i know that whether i live or dieis not amatter of indifference to you</s> she looked up and saw that his eyes were fixed upon her gravely</s>  shereddened</s>  a curious feeling came into her heart</s> i will go with you wherever you choose she said humbly</s> come then</s> they stepped out into the night</s>  and now without rain the storm hadpassed away and the stars were shining</s>  they walked quickly</s>  arthurwent in front of them</s>  dr porhot and susie followed him side by sideand they had to hasten their steps in order not to be left behind</s>  itseemed to them that the horror of the night was passed and there wasa fragrancy in the air which was wonderfully refreshing</s>  the sky wasbeautiful</s>  and at last they came to skene</s>  arthur led them again to theopening in the palisade and he took susies hand</s>  presently they stoodin the place from which a few days before they had seen the house</s>  asthen it stood in massive blackness against the night and as then theattic windows shone out with brilliant lights</s>  susie started for shehad expected that the whole place would be in darkness</s> there is no danger i promise you said arthur gently</s>  we are going tofind out the meaning of all this mystery</s> he began to walk towards the house</s> have you a weapon of some sort</s>  asked the doctor</s> arthur handed him a revolver</s> take this</s>  it will reassure you but you will have no need of it</s>  ibought it the other day wheni had other plans</s> susie gave a little shudder</s>  they reached the drive and walked to thegreat portico which adorned the facade of the house</s>  arthur tried thehandle but it would not open</s> will you wait here</s>  he said</s>  i can get through one of the windows andi will let you in</s> he left them</s>  they stood quietly there with anxious hearts they couldnot guess what they would see</s>  they were afraid that something wouldhappen to arthur and susie regretted that she had not insisted on goingwith him</s>  suddenly she remembered that awful moment when the light of thelamp had been thrown where all expected to see a body and there wasnothing</s> what do you think it meant</s>  she cried suddenly</s>  what is theexplanation</s> perhaps we shall see now answered the doctor</s> arthur still lingered and she could not imagine what had become of him</s> all sorts of horrible fancies passed through her mind and she dreadedshe knew not what</s>  at last they heard a footstep inside the house andthe door was opened</s> i was convinced that nobody slept here but i was obliged to make sure</s> i had some difficulty in getting in</s> susie hesitated to enter</s>  she did not know what horrors awaited her andthe darkness was terrifying</s> i cannot see she said</s> ive brought a torch said arthur</s> he pressed a button and a narrow ray of bright light was cast upon thefloor</s>  dr porhot and susie went in</s>  arthur carefully closed the doorand flashed the light of his torch all round them</s>  they stood in a largehall the floor of which was scattered with the skins of lions that haddoon his celebrated expedition had killed in africa</s>  there were perhapsa dozen and their number gave a wild barbaric note</s>  a great oakstaircase led to the upper floors</s> we must go through all the rooms said arthur</s> he did not expect to find haddo till they came to the lighted attics butit seemed needful nevertheless to pass right through the house on theirway</s>  a flash of his torch had shown him that the walls of the hall weredecorated with all manner of armour ancient swords of eastern handiworkbarbaric weapons from central africa savage implements of medievalwarfare and an idea came to him</s>  he took down a huge battleaxe andswung it in his hand</s> now come</s> silently holding their breath as though they feared to wake the deadthey went into the first room</s>  they saw it difficultly with their scantlight since the thin shaft of brilliancy emphasising acutely thesurrounding darkness revealed it only piece by piece</s>  it was a largeroom evidently unused for the furniture was covered with holland andthere was a mustiness about it which suggested that the windows wereseldom opened</s>  as in many old houses the rooms led not from a passagebut into one another and they walked through many till they came backinto the hall</s>  they had all a desolate uninhabited air</s>  their sombrenesswas increased by the oak with which they were panelled</s>  there waspanelling in the hall too and on the stairs that led broadly to thetop of the house</s>  as they ascended arthur stopped for one moment andpassed his hand over the polished wood</s> it would burn like tinder he said</s> they went through the rooms on the first floor and they were as emptyand as cheerless</s>  presently they came to that which had been margarets</s> in a bowl were dead flowers</s>  her brushes were still on the toilet table</s> but it was a gloomy chamber with its dark oak and so comfortless thatsusie shuddered</s>  arthur stood for a time and looked at it but he saidnothing</s>  they found themselves again on the stairs and they went to thesecond storey</s>  but here they seemed to be at the top of the house</s> how does one get up to the attics</s>  said arthur looking about him withsurprise</s> he paused for a while to think</s>  then he nodded his head</s> there must be some steps leading out of one of the rooms</s> they went on</s>  and now the ceilings were much lower with heavy beamsand there was no furniture at all</s>  the emptiness seemed to makeeverything more terrifying</s>  they felt that they were on the thresholdof a great mystery and susies heart began to beat fast</s>  arthurconducted his examination with the greatest method he walked roundeach room carefully looking for a door that might lead to a staircasebut there was no sign of one</s> what will you do if you cant find the way up</s>  asked susie</s> i shall find the way up he answered</s> they came to the staircase once more and had discovered nothing</s>  theylooked at one another helplessly</s> its quite clear there is a way said arthur with impatience</s>  theremust be something in the nature of a hidden door somewhere or other</s> he leaned against the balustrade and meditated</s>  the light of his lanternthrew a narrow ray upon the opposite wall</s> i feel certain it must be in one of the rooms at the end of the house</s> that seems the most natural place to put a means of ascent to theattics</s> they went back and again he examined the panelling of a small room thathad outside walls on three sides of it</s>  it was the only room that did notlead into another</s> it must be here he said</s> presently he gave a little laugh for he saw that a small door wasconcealed by the woodwork</s>  he pressed it where he thought there might bea spring and it flew open</s>  their torch showed them a narrow woodenstaircase</s>  they walked up and found themselves in front of a door</s>  arthurtried it but it was locked</s>  he smiled grimly</s> will you get back a little he said</s> he lifted his axe and swung it down upon the latch</s>  the handle wasshattered but the lock did not yield</s>  he shook his head</s>  as he pausedfor a moment an there was a complete silence susie distinctly heard aslight noise</s>  she put her hand on arthurs arm to call his attention toit and with strained ears they listened</s>  there was something alive onthe other side of the door</s>  they heard its curious sound it was not thatof a human voice it was not the crying of an animal it wasextraordinary</s> it was the sort of gibber hoarse and rapid and it filled them with anicy terror because it was so weird and so unnatural</s> come away arthur said susie</s>  come away</s> theres some living thing in there he answered</s> he did not know why the sound horrified him</s>  the sweat broke out on hisforehead</s> something awful will happen to us whispered susie shaking withuncontrollable fear</s> the only thing is to break the door down</s> the horrid gibbering was drowned by the noise he made</s>  quickly withoutpausing he began to hack at the oak door with all his might</s>  in rapidsuccession his heavy blows rained down and the sound echoed through theempty house</s>  there was a crash and the door swung back</s>  they had been solong in almost total darkness that they were blinded for an instant bythe dazzling light</s>  and then instinctively they started back for as thedoor opened a wave of heat came out upon them so that they could hardlybreathe</s>  the place was like an oven</s> they entered</s>
 it was lit by enormous lamps the light of which wasincreased by reflectors and warmed by a great furnace</s>  they could notunderstand why so intense a heat was necessary</s>  the narrow windows wereclosed</s>  dr porhot caught sight of a thermometer and was astounded at thetemperature it indicated</s>  the room was used evidently as a laboratory</s>  onbroad tables were testtubes basins and baths of white porcelainmeasuringglasses and utensils of all sorts but the surprising thingwas the great scale upon which everything was</s>  neither arthur nor drporhot had ever seen such gigantic measures nor such large testtubes</s> there were rows of bottles like those in the dispensary of a hospitaleach containing great quantities of a different chemical</s>  the threefriends stood in silence</s>  the emptiness of the room contrasted so oddlywith its appearance of being in immediate use that it was uncanny</s>  susiefelt that he who worked there was in the midst of his labours and mightreturn at any moment he could have only gone for an instant into anotherchamber in order to see the progress of some experiment</s>  it was quitesilent</s>  whatever had made those vague unearthly noises was hushed bytheir approach</s> the door was closed between this room and the next</s>  arthur opened it andthey found themselves in a long low attic ceiled with great rafters asbrilliantly lit and as hot as the first</s>  here too were broad tables ladenwith retorts instruments for heating huge testtubes and all manner ofvessels</s>  the furnace that warmed it gave a steady heat</s>  arthurs gazetravelled slowly from table to table and he wondered what haddosexperiments had really been</s>  the air was heavy with an extraordinaryodour it was not musty like that of the closed rooms through which theyhad passed but singularly pungent disagreeable and sickly</s>  he askedhimself what it could spring from</s>  then his eyes fell upon a hugereceptacle that stood on the table nearest to the furnace</s>  it was coveredwith a white cloth</s>  he took it off</s>  the vessel was about four feet highround and shaped somewhat like a washing tub but it was made of glassmore than an inch thick</s>  in it a spherical mass a little larger than afootball of a peculiar livid colour</s>  the surface was smooth but rathercoarsely grained and over it ran a dense system of bloodvessels</s>  itreminded the two medical men of those huge tumours which are preserved inspirit in hospital museums</s>  susie looked at it with an incomprehensibledisgust</s>  suddenly she gave a cry</s> good god its moving</s> arthur put his hand on her arm quickly to quieten her and bent down withirresistible curiosity</s>  they saw that it was a mass of flesh unlike thatof any human being and it pulsated regularly</s>  the movement was quitedistinct up and down like the delicate heaving of a womans breast whenshe is asleep</s>  arthur touched the thing with one finger and it shrankslightly</s> its quite warm he said</s> he turned it over and it remained in the position in which he had placedit as if there were neither top nor bottom to it</s>  but they could seenow irregularly placed on one side a few short hairs</s>  they were justlike human hairs</s> is it alive</s>  whispered susie struck with horror and amazement</s> yes</s> arthur seemed fascinated</s>  he could not take his eyes off the loathsomething</s>  he watched it slowly heave with even motion</s> what can it mean</s>  he asked</s> he looked at dr porhot with pale startled face</s>  a thought was coming tohim but a thought so unnatural extravagant and terrible that he pushedit from him with a movement of both hands as though it were a materialthing</s>  then all three turned around abruptly with a start for they heardagain the wild gibbering which had first shocked their ears</s>  in thewonder of this revolting object they had forgotten all the rest</s>  thesound seemed extraordinarily near and susie drew back instinctively forit appeared to come from her very side</s> theres nothing here said arthur</s>  it must be in the next room</s> oh arthur let us go cried susie</s>  im afraid to see what may be instore for us</s>  it is nothing to us and what we see may poison our sleepfor ever</s> she looked appealingly at dr porhot</s>  he was white and anxious</s>  the heatof that place had made the sweat break out on his forehead</s> i have seen enough</s>  i want to see no more he said</s> then you may go both of you answered arthur</s>  i do not wish to forceyou to see anything</s>  but i shall go on</s>  whatever it is i wish to findout</s> but haddo</s>  supposing he is there waiting</s>  perhaps you are only walkinginto a trap that he has set for you</s> i am convinced that haddo is dead</s> again that unintelligible jargon unhuman and shrill fell upon theirears and arthur stepped forward</s>  susie did not hesitate</s>  she wasprepared to follow him anywhere</s>  he opened the door and there was asudden quiet</s>  whatever made those sounds was there</s>  it was a larger roomthan any on the others and much higher for it ran along the whole frontof the house</s>  the powerful lamps showed every corner of it at once butabove the beams of the open ceiling were dark with shadow</s>  and here thenauseous odour which had struck them before was so overpowering thatfor a while they could not go in</s>  it was indescribably foul</s>  even arthurthought it would make him sick and he looked at the windows to see if itwas possible to open them but it seemed they were hermetically closed</s> the extreme warmth made the air more overpowering</s>  there were fourfurnaces here and they were all alight</s>  in order to give out more heatand to burn slowly the fronts of them were open and one could see thatthey were filled with glowing coke</s> the room was furnished no differently from the others but to the variousinstruments for chemical operations on a large scale were added allmanner of electrical appliances</s>  several books were lying about and onehad been left open face downwards on the edge of a table</s>  but whatimmediately attracted their attention was a row of those large glassvessels like that which they had seen in the adjoining room</s>  each wascovered with a white cloth</s>  they hesitated a moment for they knew thathere they were face to face with the great enigma</s>  at last arthur pulledaway the cloth from one</s>  none of them spoke</s>  they stared with astonishedeyes</s>  for here too was a strange mass of flesh almost as large as anewborn child but there was in it the beginnings of something ghastlyhuman</s>  it was shaped vaguely like an infant but the legs were joinedtogether so that it looked like a mummy rolled up in its coverings</s> there were neither feet nor knees</s>  the trunk was formless but therewas a curious thickening on each side it was as if a modeller had meantto make a figure with the arms loosely bent but had left the workunfinished so that they were still one with the body</s>  there was somethingthat resembled a human head covered with long golden hair but it washorrible it was an uncouth mass without eyes or nose or mouth</s>  thecolour was a kind of sickly pink and it was almost transparent</s>  therewas a very slight movement in it rhythmical and slow</s>  it was living too</s> then quickly arthur removed the covering from all the other jars but oneand in a flash of the eyes they saw abominations so awful that susie hadto clench her fists in order not to scream</s>  there was one monstrous thingin which the limbs approached nearly to the human</s>  it was extraordinarilyheaped up with fat tiny arms little bloated legs and an absurd squatbody so that it looked like a chinese mandarin in porcelain</s>  in anotherthe trunk was almost like that of a human child except that it waspatched strangely with red and grey</s>  but the terror of it was thatat the neck it branched hideously and there were two distinct headsmonstrously large but duly provided with all their features</s>  thefeatures were a caricature of humanity so shameful that one could hardlybear to look</s>  and as the light fell on it the eyes of each head openedslowly</s>  they had no pigment in them but were pink like the eyes ofwhite rabbits and they stared for a moment with an odd unseeing glance</s> then they were shut again and what was curiously terrifying was that themovements were not quite simultaneous the eyelids of one head fellslowly just before those of the other</s>  and in another place was a ghastlymonster in which it seemed that two bodies had been dreadfully entangledwith one another</s>  it was a creature of nightmare with four arms and fourlegs and this one actually moved</s>  with a peculiar motion it crawledalong the bottom of the great receptacle in which it was kept towardsthe three persons who looked at it</s>  it seemed to wonder what they did</s> susie started back with fright as it raised itself on its four legs andtried to reach up to them</s> susie turned away and hid her face</s>  she could not look at those ghastlycounterfeits of humanity</s>  she was terrified and ashamed</s>
do you understand what this means</s>  said dr porhot to arthur in anawed voice</s>  it means that he has discovered the secret of life</s>
was it for these vile monstrosities that margaret was sacrificed in allher loveliness</s> the two men looked at one another with sad wondering eyes</s> dont you remember that he talked of the manufacture of human beings</s> its these misshapen things that hes succeeding in producing said thedoctor</s> there is one more that we havent seen said arthur</s> he pointed to the covering which still hid the largest of the vases</s>  hehad a feeling that it contained the most fearful of all these monstersand it was not without an effort that he drew the cloth away</s>  but nosooner had he done this than something sprang up so that instinctivelyhe started back and it began to gibber in piercing tones</s>  these were theunearthly sounds that they had heard</s>  it was not a voice it was a kindof raucous crying hoarse yet shrill uneven like the barking of a dogand appalling</s>  the sounds came forth in rapid succession angrily asthough the being that uttered them sought to express itself in furiouswords</s>  it was mad with passion and beat against the glass walls of itsprison with clenched fists</s>  for the hands were human hands and thebody though much larger was of the shape of a newborn child</s>  thecreature must have stood about four feet high</s>  the head was horriblymisshapen</s>  the skull was enormous smooth and distended like that of ahydrocephalic and the forehead protruded over the face hideously</s>  thefeatures were almost unformed preternaturally small under the greatoverhanging brow and they had an expression of fiendish malignity</s> the tiny misshapen countenance writhed with convulsive fury and fromthe mouth poured out a foaming spume</s>  it raised its voice higher andhigher shrieking senseless gibberish in its rage</s>  then it began to hurlits whole body madly against the glass walls and to beat its head</s>  itappeared to have a sudden incomprehensible hatred for the threestrangers</s>  it was trying to fly at them</s>  the toothless gums movedspasmodically and it threw its face into horrible grimaces</s>  thatnameless loathsome abortion was the nearest that oliver haddo hadcome to the human form</s> come away said arthur</s>  we must not look at this</s> he quickly flung the covering over the jar</s> yes for gods sake let us go said susie</s> we havent done yet answered arthur</s>  we havent found the author ofall this</s> he looked at the room in which they were but there was no door exceptthat by which they had entered</s>  then he uttered a startled cry andstepping forward fell on his knee</s> on the other side of the long tables heaped up with instruments hiddenso that at first they had not seen him oliver haddo lay on the floordead</s>  his blue eyes were staring wide and they seemed larger than theyhad ever been</s>  they kept still the expression of terror which they hadworn in the moment of his agony and his heavy face was distorted withdeadly fear</s>  it was purple and dark and the eyes were injected withblood</s> he died of suffocation whispered dr porhot</s> arthur pointed to the neck</s>  there could be seen on it distinctly themarks of the avenging fingers that had strangled the life out of him</s>  itwas impossible to hesitate</s> i told you that i had killed him said arthur</s> then he remembered something more</s>  he took hold of the right arm</s>  he wasconvinced that it had been broken during that desperate struggle in thedarkness</s>  he felt it carefully and listened</s>  he heard plainly the twoparts of the bone rub against one another</s>  the dead mans arm was brokenjust in the place where he had broken it</s>  arthur stood up</s>  he took onelast look at his enemy</s>  that vast mass of flesh lay heaped up on thefloor in horrible disorder</s> now that you have seen will you come away</s>  said susie interruptinghim</s> the words seemed to bring him suddenly to himself</s> yes we must go quickly</s> they turned away and with hurried steps walked through those brightattics till they came to the stairs</s> now go down and wait for me at the door said arthur</s>  i will followyou immediately</s> what are you going to do</s>  asked susie</s> never mind</s>  do as i tell you</s>  i have not finished here yet</s> they went down the great oak staircase and waited in the hall</s>  theywondered what arthur was about</s>  presently he came running down</s> be quick</s>  he cried</s>  we have no time to lose</s> what have you done arthur</s> theres no time to tell you now</s> he hurried them out and slammed the door behind him</s>  he took susieshand</s> now we must run</s>  come</s> she did not know what his haste signified but her heart beat furiously</s> he dragged her along</s>  dr porhot hurried on behind them</s>  arthur plungedinto the wood</s>  he would not leave them time to breathe</s> you must be quick he said</s> at last they came to the opening in the fence and he helped them to getthrough</s>  then he carefully replaced the wooden paling and taking susiesarm began to walk rapidly towards their inn</s> im frightfully tired she said</s>  i simply cant go so fast</s> you must</s>  presently you can rest as long as you like</s> they walked very quickly for a while</s>  now and then arthur looked back</s> the night was still quite dark and the stars shone out in their myriads</s> at last he slackened their pace</s> now you can go more slowly he said</s> susie saw the smiling glance that he gave her</s>  his eyes were full oftenderness</s>  he put his arm affectionately round her shoulders to supporther</s> im afraid youre quite exhausted poor thing he said</s>  im sorry tohave had to hustle you so much</s> it doesnt matter at all</s> she leaned against him comfortably</s>  with that protecting arm about hershe felt capable of any fatigue</s>  dr porhot stopped</s> you must really let me roll myself a cigarette he said</s> you may do whatever you like answered arthur</s> there was a different ring in his voice now and it was soft with agoodhumour that they had not heard in it for many months</s>  he appearedsingularly relieved</s>  susie was ready to forget the terrible past andgive herself over to the happiness that seemed at last in store for her</s> they began to saunter slowly on</s>  and now they could take pleasure in theexquisite night</s>  the air was very suave odorous with the heather thatwas all about them and there was an enchanting peace in that scene whichwonderfully soothed their weariness</s>  it was dark still but they knew thedawn was at hand and susie rejoiced in the approaching day</s>  in the eastthe azure of the night began to thin away into pale amethyst and thetrees seemed gradually to stand out from the darkness in a ghostlybeauty</s>  suddenly birds began to sing all around them in a splendidchorus</s>  from their feet a lark sprang up with a rustle of wings andmounting proudly upon the air chanted blithe canticles to greet themorning</s>  they stood upon a little hill</s> let us wait here and see the sun rise said susie</s> as you will</s> they stood all three of them and susie took in deep joyful breaths ofthe sweet air of dawn</s>  the whole land spread at her feet was clothed inthe purple dimness that heralds day and she exulted in its beauty</s>  butshe noticed that arthur unlike herself and dr porhot did not looktoward the east</s>  his eyes were fixed steadily upon the place from whichthey had come</s>  what did he look for in the darkness of the west</s>  sheturned round and a cry broke from her lips for the shadows there werelurid with a deep red glow</s> it looks like a fire she said</s> it is</s>  skene is burning like tinder</s> and as he spoke it seemed that the roof fell in for suddenly vast flamessprang up rising high into the still night air and they saw that thehouse they had just left was blazing furiously</s>  it was a magnificentsight from the distant hill on which they stood to watch the fire as itsoared and sank as it shot scarlet tongues along like strange titanicmonsters as it raged from room to room</s>  skene was burning</s>  it was beyondthe reach of human help</s>  in a little while there would be no trace of allthose crimes and all those horrors</s>  now it was one mass of flame</s>  itlooked like some primeval furnace where the gods might work unheardofmiracles</s> arthur what have you done</s>  asked susie in a tone that was hardlyaudible</s> he did not answer directly</s>  he put his arm about her shoulder again sothat she was obliged to turn round</s>
look the sun is rising</s> in the east a long ray of light climbed up the sky and the sun yellowand round appeared upon the face of the earth</s> </s>
