almost be placed at the head of the english nobility</s> although the grandson of a mere country gentleman his fortunateancestor in the decline of the last century had captivated the heiressof the montacutes dukes of bellamont a celebrated race of the timesof the plantagenets</s>  the bridegroom at the moment of his marriagehad adopted the illustrious name of his young and beautiful wife</s>  mr</s> montacute was by nature a man of energy and of an enterprising spirit</s> his vast and early success rapidly developed his native powers</s>  with thecastles and domains and boroughs of the bellamonts he resolved also toacquire their ancient baronies and their modern coronets</s>  the times werefavourable to his projects though they might require the devotion ofa life</s>  he married amid the disasters of the american war</s>  the king andhis minister appreciated the independent support afforded them by mr</s> montacute who represented his county and who commanded five votesin the house besides his own</s>  he was one of the chief pillars of theircause but he was not only independent he was conscientious and hadscruples</s>  saratoga staggered him</s>  the defection of the montacute votesat this moment would have at once terminated the struggle betweenengland and her colonies</s>  a fresh illustration of the advantages ofour parliamentary constitution</s>  the independent mr</s>  montacute howeverstood by his sovereign his five votes continued to cheer the noble lordin the blue ribbon and their master took his seat and the oaths in thehouse of lords as earl of bellamont and viscount montacute</s>  this mightbe considered sufficiently well for one generation but the silver spoonwhich some fairy had placed in the cradle of the earl of bellamont wasof colossal proportions</s>  the french revolution succeeded the americanwar and was occasioned by it</s>  it was but just therefore that it alsoshould bring its huge quota to the elevation of the man whom a colonialrevolt had made an earl</s>  amid the panic of jacobinism the declamationsof the friends of the people the sovereign having no longer hanover fora refuge and the prime minister examined as a witness in favour of thevery persons whom he was trying for high treason the earl of bellamontmade a calm visit to downing street and requested the revival of allthe honours of the ancient earls and dukes of bellamont in his ownperson</s>  mr</s>  pitt who was far from favourable to the exclusive characterwhich distinguished the english peerage in the last century washimself not disinclined to accede to the gentle request of his powerfulsupporter but the king was less flexible</s>  his majesty indeed was onprinciple not opposed to the revival of titles in families to whom thedomains without the honours of the old nobility had descended and herecognised the claim of the present earls of bellamont eventually toregain the strawberry leaf which had adorned the coronet of the fatherof the present countess</s>  but the king was of opinion that this supremedistinction ought only to be conferred on the blood of the old houseand that a generation therefore must necessarily elapse before aduke of bellamont could again figure in the golden book of the englisharistocracy</s> but george the third with all his firmness was doomed to frequentdiscomfiture</s>  his lot was cast in troubled waters and he had often todeal with individuals as inflexible as himself</s>  benjamin franklin wasnot more calmly contumacious than the individual whom his treason hadmade an english peer</s>  in that age of violence change and panic powerdirected by a clear brain and an obdurate spirit could not fail of itsaim and so it turned out that in the very teeth of the royal willthe simple country gentleman whose very name was forgotten becameat the commencement of this century duke of bellamont marquis ofmontacute earl of bellamont dacre and villeroy with all the baroniesof the plantagenets in addition</s>  the only revenge of the king was thathe never would give the duke of bellamont the garter</s>  it was as wellperhaps that there should be something for his son to desire</s> the duke and duchess of bellamont were the handsomest couple in englandand devoted to each other but they had only one child</s>  fortunatelythat child was a son</s>  precious life</s>  the marquis of montacute wasmarried before he was of age</s>  not a moment was to be lost to find heirsfor all these honours</s>  perhaps had his parents been less precipitatetheir object might have been more securely obtained</s>  the union was nota happy one</s>  the first duke had however the gratification of dying agrandfather</s>  his successor bore no resemblance to him except in thatbeauty which became a characteristic of the race</s>  he was born to enjoynot to create</s>  a man of pleasure the chosen companion of the regent inhis age of riot he was cut off in his prime but he lived long enoughto break his wifes heart and his sons spirit like himself too anonly child</s> the present duke of bellamont had inherited something of the clearintelligence of his grandsire with the gentle disposition of hismother</s>  his fair abilities and his benevolent inclinations had beencultivated</s>  his mother had watched over the child in whom she foundalike the charm and consolation of her life</s>  but at a certain period ofyouth the formation of character requires a masculine impulse and thatwas wanting</s>  the duke disliked his son in time he became even jealousof him</s>  the duke had found himself a father at too early a period oflife</s>  himself in his lusty youth he started with alarm at the form thatrecalled his earliest and most brilliant hour and who might prove arival</s>  the son was of a gentle and affectionate nature and sighed forthe tenderness of his harsh and almost vindictive parent</s>  but he had notthat passionate soul which might have appealed and perhaps not in vainto the dormant sympathies of the being who had created him</s>  the youngmontacute was by nature of an extreme shyness and the accidents of hislife had not tended to dissipate his painful want of selfconfidence</s> physically courageous his moral timidity was remarkable</s>  he alternatelyblushed or grew pale in his rare interviews with his father trembledin silence before the undeserved sarcasm and often endured the unjustaccusation without an attempt to vindicate himself</s>  alone and intears alike of woe and indignation he cursed the want of resolution orability which had again missed the opportunity that both for his motherand himself might have placed affairs in a happier position</s>  mostpersons under these circumstances would have become bitter butmontacute was too tender for malice and so he only turned melancholy</s> on the threshold of manhood montacute lost his mother and this seemedthe catastrophe of his unhappy life</s>  his father neither shared hisgrief nor attempted to alleviate it</s>  on the contrary he seemed toredouble his efforts to mortify his son</s>  his great object was to preventlord montacute from entering society and he was so complete a masterof the nervous temperament on which he was acting that there appeareda fair chance of his succeeding in his benevolent intentions</s>  when hissons education was completed the duke would not furnish him with themeans of moving in the world in a becoming manner or even sanction histravelling</s>  his grace was resolved to break his sons spirit by keepinghim immured in the country</s>  other heirs apparent of a rich seignorywould soon have removed these difficulties</s>  by bill or by bond byliving usury or by postobit liquidation by all the means that privatefriends or public offices could supply the sinews of war would havebeen forthcoming</s>  they would have beaten their fathers horses atnewmarket eclipsed them with their mistresses and sitting for theirboroughs voted against their party</s>  but montacute was not one of thoseyoung heroes who rendered so distinguished the earlier part of thiscentury</s>  he had passed his life so much among women and clergymen thathe had never emancipated himself from the old law that enjoined himto honour a parent</s>  besides with all his shyness and timidity he wasextremely proud</s>  he never forgot that he was a montacute though he hadforgotten like the world in general that his grandfather once bore adifferent and humbler name</s>  all merged in the great fact that he wasthe living representative of those montacutes of bellamont whose wildand politic achievements or the sustained splendour of whose statelylife had for seven hundred years formed a stirring and superb portionof the history and manners of our country</s>  death was preferable inhis view to having such a name soiled in the haunts of jockeys andcourtesans and usurers and keen as was the anguish which the conductof the duke to his mother or himself had often occasioned him itwas sometimes equalled in degree by the sorrow and the shame which heendured when he heard of the name of bellamont only in connection withsome stratagem of the turf or some frantic revel</s>  without a friendalmost without an acquaintance montacute sought refuge in love</s>  she whoshed over his mournful life the divine ray of feminine sympathy washis cousin the daughter of his mothers brother an english peer butresident in the north of ireland where he had vast possessions</s>  it wasa family otherwise little calculated to dissipate the reserve and gloomof a depressed and melancholy youth puritanical severe and formal intheir manners their relaxations a bible society or a meeting for theconversion of the jews</s>  but lady katherine was beautiful and all werekind to one to whom kindness was strange and the soft pathos of whosesolitary spirit demanded affection</s> montacute requested his fathers permission to marry his cousin and wasimmediately refused</s>  the duke particularly disliked his wifes familybut the fact is he had no wish that his son should ever marry</s>  he meantto perpetuate his race himself and was at this moment in the midst ofhis orgies meditating a second alliance which should compensate himfor his boyish blunder</s>  in this state of affairs montacute at lengthstung to resistance inspired by the most powerful of passions andacted upon by a stronger volition than his own was planning a marriagein spite of his father love a cottage by an irish lake and sevenhundred ayear when intelligence arrived that his father whosepowerful frame and vigorous health seemed to menace a patriarchal termwas dead</s> the new duke of bellamont had no experience of the world but thoughlong cowed by his father he had a strong character</s>  though the circleof his ideas was necessarily contracted they were all clear and firm</s> in his moody youth he had imbibed certain impressions and arrived atcertain conclusions and they never quitted him</s>  his mother was hismodel of feminine perfection and he had loved his cousin because shebore a remarkable resemblance to her aunt</s>  again he was of opinionthat the tie between the father and the son ought to be one of intimateconfidence and refined tenderness and he resolved that if providencefavoured him with offspring his child should ever find in him absolutedevotion of thought and feeling</s> a variety of causes and circumstances had impressed him with aconviction that what is called fashionable life was a compound offrivolity and fraud of folly and vice and he resolved never to enterit</s>  to this he was perhaps in some degree unconsciously prompted byhis reserved disposition and by his painful sense of inexperience forhe looked forward to this world with almost as much of apprehensionas of dislike</s>  to politics in the vulgar sense of the word he had anequal repugnance</s>  he had a lofty idea of his duty to his sovereign andhis country and felt within him the energies that would respond to aconjuncture</s>  but he acceded to his title in a period of calmness whennothing was called in question and no danger was apprehended and asfor the fights of factions the duke altogether held himself aloof fromthem he wanted nothing not even the blue ribbon which he was soonobliged to take</s>  next to his domestic hearth all his being wasconcentrated in his duties as a great proprietor of the soil</s>  onthese he had long pondered and these he attempted to fulfil</s>  thatperformance indeed was as much a source of delight to him as ofobligation</s>  he loved the country and a country life</s>  his reserve seemedto melt away the moment he was on his own soil</s>  courteous he everwas but then he became gracious and hearty</s>  he liked to assemble thecounty around him to keep the county together the county seemedalways his first thought he was proud of the county where he reignedsupreme not more from his vast possessions than from the influence ofhis sweet yet stately character which made those devoted to him whootherwise were independent of his sway</s> from straitened circumstances and without having had a single fancy ofyouth gratified the duke of bellamont had been suddenly summoned tothe lordship of an estate scarcely inferior in size and revenue tosome continental principalities to dwell in palaces and castles tobe surrounded by a disciplined retinue and to find every wish and wantgratified before they could be expressed or anticipated</s>  yet he showedno elation and acceded to his inheritance as serene as if he had neverfelt a pang or proved a necessity</s>  she whom in the hour of trial he hadselected for the future partner of his life though a remarkable womanby a singular coincidence of feeling for it was as much from heroriginal character as from sympathy with her husband confirmed him inall his moods</s> katherine duchess of bellamont was beautiful small and delicate instructure with a dazzling complexion and a smile which though rarewas of the most winning and brilliant character</s>  her rich brown hairand her deep blue eye might have become a dryad but her brow denotedintellect of a high order and her mouth spoke inexorable resolution</s> she was a woman of fixed opinions and of firm and compact prejudices</s> brought up in an austere circle where on all matters irrevocablejudgment had been passed which enjoyed the advantages of knowingexactly what was true in dogma what just in conduct and what correctin manners she had early acquired the convenient habit of decisionwhile her studious mind employed its considerable energies in masteringevery writer who favoured those opinions which she had previouslydetermined were the right ones</s> the duchess was deep in the divinity of the seventeenth century</s>  in thecontroversies between the two churches she could have perplexed st</s> omers or maynooth</s>  chillingworth might be found her boudoir</s>  not thather graces reading was confined to divinity on the contrary it wasvarious and extensive</s>  puritan in religion she was precisian in moralsbut in both she was sincere</s>  she was so in all things</s>  her nature wasfrank and simple if she were inflexible she at least wished to bejust and though very conscious of the greatness of her position shewas so sensible of its duties that there was scarcely any exertion whichshe would evade or any humility from which she would shrink if shebelieved she were doing her duty to her god or to her neighbour</s> it will be seen therefore that the duke of bellamont found no obstaclein his wife who otherwise much influenced his conduct to the planswhich he had preconceived for the conduct of his life after marriage</s> the duchess shrank with a feeling of haughty terror from that world offashion which would have so willingly greeted her</s>  during the greaterpart of the year therefore the bellamonts resided in their magnificentcastle in their distant county occupied with all the business andthe pleasures of the provinces</s>  while the duke at the head of themagistracy in the management of his estates and in the sports of whichhe was fond found ample occupation his wife gave an impulse to thecharity of the county founded schools endowed churches receivedtheir neighbours read her books and amused herself in the creation ofbeautiful gardens for which she had a passion</s> after easter parliament requiring their presence the courtyard of oneof the few palaces in london opened and the world learnt that the dukeand duchess of bellamont had arrived at bellamont house from montacutecastle</s>  during their stay in town which they made as brief as theywell could and which never exceeded three months they gave a seriesof great dinners principally attended by noble relations and thosefamilies of the county who were so fortunate as to have also a residencein london</s>  regularly every year also there was a grand banquetgiven to some members of the royal family by the duke and duchess ofbellamont and regularly every year the duke and duchess of bellamonthad the honour of dining at the palace</s>  except at a ball or concertunder the royal roof the duke and duchess were never seen anywherein the evening</s>  the great ladies indeed the lady st</s>  julians and themarchionesses of deloraine always sent them invitations though theywere ever declined</s>  but the bellamonts maintained a sort oftraditional acquaintance with a few great houses either by the tiesof relationship which among the aristocracy are very ramified orby occasionally receiving travelling magnificoes at their hospitablecastle</s> to the great body however of what is called the world the worldthat lives in st</s>

ofthe milfords and the fitzherons the berners and the egertons the mr</s> ormsbys and the alfred mountchesneys the duke and duchess of bellamontwere absolutely unknown</s> all that the world knew was that there was a great peer who was calledduke of bellamont that there was a great house in london with acourtyard which bore his name that he had a castle in the countrywhich was one of the boasts of england and that this great duke had aduchess but they never met them anywhere nor did their wives and theirsisters and the ladies whom they admired or who admired themeither at ball or at breakfast either at morning dances or at eveningdjeuners</s>  it was clear therefore that the bellamonts might be verygreat people but they were not in society</s> it must have been some organic law or some fate which uses structurefor its fulfilment but again it seemed that the continuance of thegreat house of montacute should depend upon the life of a single being</s> the duke like his father and his grandfather was favoured only withone child but that child was again a son</s>  from the moment of his birththe very existence of his parents seemed identified with his welfare</s> the duke and his wife mutually assumed to each other a secondaryposition in comparison with that occupied by their offspring</s>  from thehour of his birth to the moment when this history opens and when he wasabout to complete his majority never had such solicitude been lavishedon human being as had been continuously devoted to the life of the younglord montacute</s>  during his earlier education he scarcely quittedhome</s>  he had indeed once been shown to eton surrounded by faithfuldomestics and accompanied by a private tutor whose vigilance wouldnot have disgraced a superintendent of police but the scarlet feverhappened to break out during his first half and lord montacute wasinstantly snatched away from the scene of danger where he was neveragain to appear</s>  at eighteen he went to christchurch</s>  his mother whohad nursed him herself wrote to him every day but this was not foundsufficient and the duke hired a residence in the neighourhood of theuniversity in order that they

somein procession</s>  the temperance band made an immense noise and theodd fellows were loudly cheered</s>  every now and then one of the dukesyeomanry galloped through the town in his regimentals of green andsilver with his dark flowing plume and clattering sabre and with anair of businesslike desperation as if he were carrying a message fromthe commanderinchief in the thickest of the fight</s> before the eventful day of which this merry morn was the harbinger thearrivals of guests at the castle had been numerous and important</s>  firstcame the brother of the duchess with his countess and

christchurch</s>  the duke had begged hiscousin to be his trustee when he married he had made him his executorand had intended him as the guardian of his son</s>  although from thedifference of their habits little thrown together in their earlieryouth lord eskdale had shown even then kind consideration for hisrelative he had even proposed that they should travel together butthe old duke would not consent to this</s>  after his death however beingneighbours as well as relatives lord eskdale had become the naturalfriend and counsellor of his grace</s> the duke deservedly reposed in him implicit confidence and entertainedan almost unbounded admiration of his cousins knowledge of mankind</s>  hewas scarcely less a favourite or less an oracle with the duchess thoughthere were subjects on which she feared lord eskdale did not entertainviews as serious as her own but lord eskdale with an extremecarelessness of manner and an apparent negligence of the minor artsof pleasing was a consummate master of the feminine idiosyncrasy andfrom a french actress to an english duchess was skilled in guidingwomen without ever letting the curb be felt</s>  scarcely a week elapsedwhen lord eskdale was in the country that a long letter of difficultieswas not received by him from montacute with an earnest request for hisimmediate advice</s>  his lordship singularly averse to letter writing andespecially to long letter writing used generally in reply to say thatin the course of a day or two he should be in their part of the worldand would talk the matter over with them</s> and indeed nothing was more amusing than to see lord eskdaleimperturbable yet not heedless with his peculiar calmness somethingbetween that of a turkish pasha and an english jockey standing upwith his back to the fire and his hands in his pockets and hearing theunited statement of a case by the duke and duchess of bellamontthe serious yet quiet and unexaggerated narrative of his grace theimpassioned interruptions decided opinions and lively expressionsof his wife when she felt the duke was not doing justice to thecircumstances or her view of them and the spartan brevity with whichwhen both his clients were exhausted their counsel summed up the wholeaffair and said three words which seemed suddenly to remove alldoubts and to solve all difficulties</s>  in all the business of life lordeskdale though he appreciated their native ability and respectedtheir considerable acquirements which he did not share looked upon hiscousins as two children and managed them as children but he was reallyattached to them and the sincere attachment of such a character isoften worth more than the most passionate devotion</s>  the last greatdomestic embarrassment at montacute had been the affair of the cooks</s> lord eskdale had taken this upon his own shoulders and writing todaubuz had sent down leander and his friends to open the minds andcharm the palates of the north</s> lord valentine and his noble parents and their daughter ladyflorentina who was a great horsewoman also arrived</s>  the countess whohad once been a beauty with the reputation of a wit and now set up forbeing a wit on

in a wrong squareand asked to their house everybody who was nobody besides lordmountjoy was vulgar and laughed too loud and lady mountjoy called youmy dear and showed her teeth</s>  a relief perhaps too from the hon</s> and rev</s>  montacute mountjoy who with lady eleanor four daughtersand two sons had been invited to celebrate the majority of the futurechieftain of their house</s>  the countess had what is called a horror ofthose mountjoys and those montacute mountjoys and what added to herannoyance was that lord valentine was always flirting with the missesmontacute mountjoy</s> the countess could find no companions in the duke and duchess ofclanronald because as she told her husband as they could not speakenglish and she could not speak scotch it was impossible to exchangeideas</s>  the bishop of the diocese was there toothless and tolerantand wishing to be on good terms with all sects provided they paychurchrates and another bishop far more vigorous and of

probably their palaces or the house of lords</s> it was hardly to be expected that her ladyship would find any reliefin the society of the marquis and marchioness of hampshire for hislordship passed

accustomed to the society of women he possesses that flexibilityof manner and that readiness of gentle repartee which a feminineapprenticeship can alone confer</s>  but lord hull was a man with a red faceand a grey head on whom coarse indulgence and the selfish negligence ofa country life had already conferred a shapeless form and whodressed something like a groom sat at dinner in stolid silence by ladyhampshire who whatever were her complaints had certainly the artif only from her questions of making her neighbours communicative</s>  thecountess examined lord hull through her eyeglass with

evidentlyexisted between them mutual confidence</s>  his lordships heart indeedwas not at jerusalem and perhaps this want of sympathy on a subjectof such rare and absorbing interest might account for the occasionalmusings of his wife taking refuge in her own solitary and devoutlypassionate soul</s>  but this deficiency on the part of his lordship couldscarcely be alleged against him as a very

tancred without the gate</s> in the centre of the kiosk was the fountain whose alluring voicehad tempted tancred to proceed further than he had at first dared toproject</s>  he must not retire without

water</s>  itslulling influence is proverbial</s>  in the present instance we mustremember that tancred had been exposed to the meridian fervour of asyrian sun that he had been the whole day under the

slippered feet</s>  overher amber vest she had an embroidered pelisse of violet silk with longhanging sleeves which showed occasionally an arm rarer than the costlyjewels which embraced it a manycoloured turkish scarf inclosed herwaist and then worn loosely over all was an outer pelisse of ambercashmere lined with the fur of the white fox</s>  at the back of herhead was a cap quite unlike the greek and turkish caps which we areaccustomed to see in england but somewhat resembling the headdress ofa mandarin round not flexible almost flat and so thickly incrustedwith pearls that it was impossible to detect the colour of the velvetwhich covered it</s>  beneath it descended two broad braids of dark brownhair which would have swept the ground had they not been turnedhalfway up and

theopposite side of the fountain and stood gazing on him with calmnessand with a kind of benignant curiosity the garden the kiosk thefalling waters recalled the past which flashed over his mind almost atthe moment when he beheld the beautiful apparition</s>  half risen yetnot willing to remain until he was on his legs to apologise for hispresence tancred still leaning on his arm and looking up at

christian church would be your guide</s> which</s>  inquired the lady there are so many in jerusalem</s>  there isthe good bishop who presented me with this volume and who is himself ahebrew he is a

it</s>  we were originally anation of twelve tribes ten long before the advent of jesus had beencarried into captivity and scattered over the east and the mediterraneanworld they are probably the

do with the crucifixion or the rejection</s> the fate of the ten tribes is a deeply interesting question saidtancred but involved in i fear inexplicableobscurity</s>  in englandthere are many who hold them to be represented by the afghans who statethat their ancestors followed the laws of moses</s>  but perhaps they ceasedto exist and were blended with their conquerors</s> the hebrews have never blended with their conquerors said the ladyproudly</s>  they were conquered frequently like all small states situateamid rival empires</s>  syria was the battlefield of the great monarchies</s> jerusalem has not been conquered oftener than athens or treated worsebut its people unhappily fought too bravely and rebelled too often soat last they were expatriated</s>  i hold that to believe that the hebrewcommunities are in a principal measure the descendants of the tentribes and of the other captivities preceding christ is a justand fair and sensible inference which explains circumstances

fakredeen proposed to himself two objects the first wasto bring together the principal chiefs of the mountain both maroniteand druse and virtually to carry into effect at canobia thatreconciliation between the two races which had been formally effected atbeiroot in the preceding month of june by the diplomatic interferenceof the great powers and through the signature of certain articles ofpeace

the course they shouldimmediately pursue to assist one in whose fate they were both so deeplyinterested</s>  the emir for the first time since their acquaintanceseemed entirely to have lost himself</s>  he looked perplexed almoststunned his language was incoherent his gestures those of despair</s> tancred while he at once ascribed all this confused demeanour to theshock which he had himself shared at finding the daughter of besso acaptive and a captive under circumstances of doubt and difficultycould not reconcile such distraction such an absence of all resourcesand presence of mind with the exuberant means and the prompt expedientswhich in general were the characteristics of his companion undercircumstances the most difficult and unforeseen</s> when they had reached their apartments fakredeen threw himself uponthe divan and moaned and suddenly starting from the couch paced thechamber with agitated step wringing his hands</s>  all that tancred couldextract from him was

to communicate withkeferinis</s>  the minister was invisible not to be found and the nightclosed in when tancred after fruitless counsels with baroni and manyunited but vain efforts to open some

entirely alone for baroniwas about making observations and endeavouring to find some clue to theposition of eva</s> tancred had resolved the moment that it was practicable to solicitan audience of astarte on the subject of eva and to enter into allthe representations respecting her which in his opinion were alonenecessary to secure for her immediately the most considerate treatmentand

obtain this audience of astarte for neither fakredeennor keferinis was to be found and no other means of achieving theresult were obvious</s> about two hours before noon baroni brought word that he had contrivedto see cypros from whom he gathered that astarte had repaired to thegreat temple of the gods</s>  instantly tancred resolved to enter thepalace and if possible to find his way to the mysterious sanctuary</s> that was a course by no means easy but the enterprising are oftenfortunate and his project proved not to be impossible</s>  he passedthrough the chambers of the palace which were entirely deserted andwith which he was familiar and he reached without difficulty the portalof bronze which led to the covered way that conducted to the templebut it was closed</s>  baffled and
