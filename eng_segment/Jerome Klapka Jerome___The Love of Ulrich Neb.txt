 gott in himmel</s>  think what it would lead to</s>  the goodgod never would have arranged things so</s>  you love one she is the onlywoman in the world for you</s> but you yourself herr pastor you have twice been married suggestedthe puzzled wheelwright</s>
 that is a very differentthing</s> why should it not come to him alone among men</s>  surely it was abeautiful thing this love a thing worthy of a man without which a manwas but a useless devourer of food cumbering the earth</s>
 how well he knew the windingmuhldes merry voice</s>  he had worked beside it played beside it all hislife</s>  often he would sit and talk to it as to an old friend readinganswers in its changing tones</s> trudchen seeing him idle pushed her cold nose into his hand</s>  trudchenjust now was feeling clever and important</s>  was she not the mother of thefive most wonderful puppies in all saxony</s>  they swarmed about his legspressing him with their little foolish heads</s>  ulrich stooped and pickedup one in each big hand</s>  but this causing jealousy and heartburninglaughing he lay down upon a log</s>  then the whole five stormed over himbiting his hair trampling with their clumsy paws upon his face tillsuddenly they raced off in a body to attack a floating feather</s>  ulrichsat up and watched them the little rogues the little foolish helplessthings that called for so much care</s>  a mother thrush twittered abovehis head</s>  ulrich rose and creeping on tiptoe peeped into the nest</s>
whoever was afraid of ulrich the wheelwright</s>  the tiny murmuring insectsbuzzed to and fro about his feet</s>  an old man passing to his eveningrest gave him goodday</s>  a zephyr whispered something to the leavesat which they laughed then passed upon his way</s>  here and there a shadowcrept out from its hidingplace</s> if only i could marry the whole village</s>  laughed ulrich to himself</s> but that of course is nonsense</s> the spring that followed let loose the dogs of war again upon thebloodstained land for now all germany taught late by common sufferingforgetfulness of local rivalries was rushing together in a mighty wavethat would sweep french feet for ever from their hold on german soil</s> ulrich for whom the love of woman seemed not would at least be thelover of his country</s>  he too would march among those brave sternhearts that stealing like a thousand rivulets from every german valleywere flowing north and west to join the prussian eagles</s> but even love of country seemed denied to ulrich of the dreamy eyes</s> his wheelwrights business had called him to a town far off</s>  he had beenwalking all the day</s>  towards evening passing the outskirts of a wooda feeble cry for help sounding from the shadows fell upon his ear</s> ulrich paused and again from the sombre wood crept that weary cry ofpain</s>
 ulrich ran and came at last to where among the wild flowers andthe grass lay prone five human figures</s>  two of them were of the germanlandwehr the other three frenchmen in the hated uniform of napoleonsfamous scouts</s>
 it had been some unimportant affair of outposts oneof those common incidents of warfare that are never recordedneverremembered save here and there by some sad face unnoticed in the crowd</s> four of the men were dead one a frenchman was still alive thoughbleeding copiously from a deep wound in the chest that with a handful ofdank grass he was trying to staunch</s> ulrich raised him in his arms</s>  the man spoke no german and ulrichknew but his mother tongue but when the man turning towards theneighbouring village with a look of terror in his halfglazed eyespleaded with his hands ulrich understood and lifting him gentlycarried him further into the wood</s> he found a small deserted shelter that had been made bycharcoalburners and there on a bed of grass and leaves ulrich laidhim and there for a week all but a day ulrich tended him and nursed himback to life coming and going stealthily like a thief in the darkness</s> then ulrich who had thought his one desire in life to be to kill allfrenchmen put food and drink into the frenchmans knapsack and guidedhim half through the night and took his hand and so they parted</s>
 he was too great a coward to go back to themand tell them that he no longer wanted to fight that the sound of thedrum brought to him only the thought of trampled grass where dead menlay with curses in their eyes</s> so with head bowed down in shame to and fro about the moaning landulrich of the dreamy eyes came and went guiding his solitary footstepsby the sounds of sorrow driving away the things of evil where theycrawled among the wounded making his way swiftly to the side of painheedless of the uniform</s> thus one day he found himself by chance near again to forestgirdledwaldnitz</s>  he would push his way across the hills wander through itsquiet ways in the moonlight while the good folks all lay sleeping</s>  hisfootsteps quickened as he drew nearer</s>  where the trees broke he wouldbe able to look down upon it see every roof he knew so wellthechurch the mill the winding muhldethe green worn grey with dancingfeet where when the hateful war was over would be heard again thesaxon folksongs</s> another was there where the forest halts on the brow of the hillafigure kneeling on the ground with his face towards the village</s>  ulrichstole closer</s>  it was the herr pfarrer praying volubly but inaudibly</s>
 a french corps ofobservation had been camped upon the hill and twice within the monthhad a french soldier been found murdered in the woods</s>  heavy had beenthe penalties exacted from the village and terrible had been thecolonels threats of vengeance</s>  now for a third time a soldier stabbedin the back had been borne into camp by his raging comrades and thisvery afternoon the colonel had sworn that if the murderer were nothanded over to him within an hour from dawn when the camp was to breakup he would before marching burn the village to the ground</s>  the herrpfarrer was on his way back from the camp where he had been to plead formercy but it had been in vain</s> such are foul deeds</s>  said ulrich</s> the people are mad with hatred of the french answered the herrpastor</s>
 it may be one it may be a dozen who have taken vengeance intotheir own hands</s>  may god forgive them</s>
they will not come forwardnot to save the village</s> can you expect it of them</s>  there is no hope for us the village willburn as a hundred others have burned</s> aye that was true ulrich had seen their blackened ruins the oldsitting with white faces among the wreckage of their homes the littlechildren wailing round their knees the tiny broods burned in theirnests</s>
the herr pfarrer had gone forward on his melancholy mission to preparethe people for their doom</s> ulrich stood alone looking down upon alt waldnitz bathed in moonlight</s> and there came to him the words of the old pastor she will be dearerto you than yourself</s>  for her you would lay down your life</s>  and ulrichknew that his love was the village of alt waldnitz where dwelt hispeople the old and wrinkled the laughing little ones where dweltthe helpless dumb things with their deep pathetic eyes where the beeshummed drowsily and the thousand tiny creatures of the day</s> they hanged him high upon a withered elm with his face towards altwaldnitz that all the village old and young might see and then tothe beat of drum and scream of fife they marched away and foresthiddenwaldnitz gathered up once more its many threads of quiet life and wovethem into homely pattern</s> they talked and argued many a time and some there were who praised andsome who blamed</s>  but the herr pfarrer could not understand</s>
then they raised ulrichs coffin reverently and the young men carriedit into the village and laid it in the churchyard that it might alwaysbe among them</s>  they reared above him what in their eyes was a grandmonument and carved upon itgreater love hath no man than this</s> </s>
