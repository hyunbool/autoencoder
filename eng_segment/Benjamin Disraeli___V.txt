happier hours when i first mentioned to you the idea of this workit was my intention while inscribing it with your name to haveentered into some details as to the principles which had guided me inits composition and the feelings with which i had attempted to shadowforth though as in in a glass darkly two of the most renowned andrefined spirits that have adorned these our latter days</s>  but now iwill only express a hope that the time may come when in these pagesyou may find some relaxation from the cares and some distractionfrom the sorrows of existence and that you will then receive thisdedication as a record of my respect and my affection</s> this work was first published in the year 1837</s> book i</s> chapter i</s> some ten years before the revolt of our american colonies there wassituate in one of our midland counties on the borders of an extensiveforest an ancient hall that belonged to the herberts but whichthough ever well preserved had not until that period been visited byany member of the family since the exile of the stuarts</s>  it was anedifice of considerable size built of grey stone much covered withivy and placed upon the last gentle elevation of a long ridge ofhills in the centre of a crescent of woods that far overtopped itsclusters of tall chimneys and turreted gables</s>  although the principalchambers were on the first story you could nevertheless step forthfrom their windows on a broad terrace whence you descended into thegardens by a double flight of stone steps exactly in the middleof its length</s>  these gardens were of some extent and filled withevergreen shrubberies of remarkable overgrowth while occasionallyturfy vistas cut in the distant woods came sloping down to thesouth as if they opened to receive the sunbeam that greeted thegenial aspect of the mansion the groundfloor was principallyoccupied by the hall itself which was of great dimensions hung roundwith many a family portrait and rural picture furnished with longoaken seats covered with scarlet cushions and ornamented with aparticoloured floor of alternate diamonds of black and white marble</s> from the centre of the roof of the mansion which was always coveredwith pigeons rose the clocktower of the chapel surmounted by avane and before the mansion itself was a large plot of grass with afountain in the centre surrounded by a hedge of honeysuckle</s> this plot of grass was separated from an extensive park that openedin front of the hall by tall iron gates on each of the pillars ofwhich was a lion rampant supporting the escutcheon of the family</s>  thedeer wandered in this enclosed and wellwooded demesne and about amile from the mansion in a direct line with the iron gates was anoldfashioned lodge which marked the limit of the park and fromwhich you emerged into a fine avenue of limes bounded on both sidesby fields</s>  at the termination of this avenue was a strong but simplegate and a woodmans cottage and then spread before you a vastlandscape of open wild lands which seemed on one side interminablewhile on the other the eye rested on the dark heights of theneighbouring forest</s> this picturesque and secluded abode was the residence of lady annabelherbert and her daughter the young and beautiful venetia a child atthe time when our history commences of very tender age</s>  it was nearlyseven years since lady annabel and her infant daughter had sought theretired shades of cherbury which they had never since quitted</s>  theylived alone and for each other the mother educated her child andthe child interested her mother by her affectionate dispositionthe development of a mind of no ordinary promise and a sort ofcaptivating grace and charming playfulness of temper which wereextremely delightful</s>  lady annabel was still young and lovely</s>  thatshe was wealthy her establishment clearly denoted and she was adaughter of one of the haughtiest houses in the kingdom</s>  it wasstrange then that with all the brilliant accidents of birth andbeauty and fortune she should still as it were in the morning ofher life have withdrawn to this secluded mansion in a county whereshe was personally unknown distant from the metropolis estrangedfrom all her own relatives and connexions and without resource ofeven a single neighbour for the only place of importance in hervicinity was uninhabited</s>  the general impression of the villagers wasthat lady annabel was a widow and yet there were some speculatorswho would shrewdly remark that her ladyship had never worn weedsalthough her husband could not have been long dead when she firstarrived at cherbury</s>  on the whole however these good people were notvery inquisitive and it was fortunate for them for there was littlechance and slight means of gratifying their curiosity</s>  the whole ofthe establishment had been formed at cherbury with the exception ofher ladyships waitingwoman mistress pauncefort and she was by fartoo great a personage to condescend to reply to any question which wasnot made to her by lady annabel herself</s> the beauty of the young venetia was not the hereditary gift of herbeautiful mother</s>  it was not from lady annabel that venetia herberthad derived those seraphic locks that fell over her shoulders anddown her neck in golden streams nor that clear grey eye even whosechildish glance might perplex the gaze of manhood nor that littleaquiline nose that gave a haughty expression to a countenance thathad never yet dreamed of pride nor that radiant complexion thatdazzled with its brilliancy like some winged minister of raffael orcorreggio</s>  the peasants that passed the lady and her daughter in theirwalks and who blessed her as they passed for all her grace andgoodness often marvelled why so fair a mother and so fair a childshould be so dissimilar that one indeed might be compared to a starrynight and the other to a sunny day</s> chapter ii</s> it was a bright and soft spring morning the dewy vistas of cherburysparkled in the sun the cooing of the pigeons sounded around thepeacocks strutted about the terrace and spread their tails withinfinite enjoyment and conscious pride and lady annabel came forthwith her little daughter to breathe the renovating odours of theseason</s>  the air was scented with the violet tufts of daffodils werescattered all about and though the snowdrop had vanished and theprimroses were fast disappearing their wild and shaggy leaves stilllooked picturesque and glad</s> mamma said the little venetia is this spring</s> this is spring my child replied lady annabel beautiful spring</s> the year is young and happy like my little girl</s> if venetia be like the spring mamma is like the summer</s>  replied thechild and the mother smiled</s>  and is not the summer young and happy</s> resumed venetia</s> it is not quite so young as the spring said lady annabel lookingdown with fondness on her little companion and i fear not quite sohappy</s> but it is as beautiful said venetia</s> it is not beauty that makes us happy said lady annabel to behappy my love we must be good</s> am i good</s>  said venetia</s> very good said lady annabeli am very happy said venetia i wonder whether if i be alwaysgood i shall always be happy</s> you cannot be happy without being good my love but happinessdepends upon the will of god</s>  if you be good he will guard over

lady annabelbut some day i will teach you</s>  mamma is now going to take a longwalk and venetia shall walk with her</s> so saying the lady annabel summoned mistress pauncefort agentlewoman of not more discreet years than might have been expectedin the attendant of so young a mistress but one well qualified forher office very zealous and devoted somewhat consequential full ofenergy and decision capable of directing fond of giving advice andhabituated to command</s>  the lady annabel leading her daughter andaccompanied by her faithful bloodhound marmion ascended one of thosesloping vistas that we have noticed mistress pauncefort followingthem about a pace behind and after her a groom at a respectfuldistance leading miss herberts donkey</s> they soon entered a winding path through the wood which was thebackground of their dwelling</s>  lady annabel was silent and lost in herreflections venetia plucked the beautiful wild hyacinths that thenabounded in the wood in such profusion that their beds spread likepatches of blue enamel and gave them to mistress pauncefort who asthe collection increased handed them over to the groom who in turndeposited them in the wicker seat prepared for his young mistress</s>  thebright sun bursting through the tender foliage of the year the clearand genial air the singing of the birds and the wild and joyousexclamations of venetia as she gathered her flowers made it acheerful party notwithstanding the silence of its mistress</s> when they emerged from the wood they found themselves on the browof the hill a small down over which venetia ran exulting in thehealthy breeze which at this exposed height was strong and fresh</s> as they advanced to the opposite declivity to that which they hadascended a wide and peculiar landscape opened before them</s>  theextreme distance was formed by an undulating ridge of lofty and savagehills nearer than these were gentler elevations partially woodedand at their base was a rich valley its green meads fed by a clearand rapid stream which glittered in the sun as it coursed on losingitself at length in a wild and sedgy lake that formed the furthestlimit of a widelyspreading park</s>  in the centre of this park andnot very remote from the banks of the rivulet was an ancient gothicbuilding that had once been an abbey of great repute and wealth andhad not much suffered in its external character by having served fornearly two centuries and a half as the principal dwelling of an oldbaronial family</s> descending the downy hill that here and there was studded with fineold trees enriching by their presence the view from the abbey ladyannabel and her party entered the meads and skirting the lakeapproached the venerable walls without crossing the stream</s> it was difficult to conceive a scene more silent and more desolate</s> there was no sign of life and not a sound save the occasionalcawing of a rook</s>  advancing towards the abbey they passed a pile ofbuildings that in the summer might be screened from sight by thefoliage of a group of elms too scanty at present to veil theirdesolation</s>  wide gaps in the roof proved that the vast and drearystables were no longer used there were empty granaries whose doorshad fallen from their hinges the gate of the courtyard was prostrateon the ground and the silent clock that once adorned the cupola overthe noble entrance arch had long lost its index</s>  even the litter ofthe yard appeared dusty and grey with age</s>  you felt sure no human footcould have disturbed it for years</s>  at the back of these buildings werenailed the trophies of the gamekeeper hundreds of wild cats dried toblackness stretched their downward heads and legs from the moulderingwall hawks magpies and jays hung in tattered remnants</s>  but allgrey and even green with age and the heads of birds in plenteousrows nailed beak upward and so dried and shrivelled by the suns andwinds and frosts of many seasons that their distinctive characterswere lost</s> do you know my good pauncefort said lady annabel that i havean odd fancy today to force an entrance into the old abbey</s>  it isstrange fond as i am of this walk that we have never yet entered it</s> do you recollect our last vain efforts</s>  shall we be more fortunatethis time think you</s> mistress pauncefort smiled and smirked and advancing to the oldgloomy porch gave a determined ring at the bell</s>  its sound mightbe heard echoing through the old cloisters but a considerable timeelapsed without any other effect being produced</s>  perhaps lady annabelwould have now given up the attempt but the little venetia expressedso much regret at the disappointment that her mother directed thegroom to reconnoitre in the neighbourhood and see if it were possibleto discover any person connected with the mansion</s> i doubt our luck my lady said mistress pauncefort for they dosay that the abbey is quite uninhabited</s> tis a pity said lady annabel for with all its desolation thereis something about this spot which ever greatly interests me</s> mamma why does no one live here</s>  said venetia</s> the master of the abbey lives abroad my child</s> why does he mamma</s> never ask questions miss venetia said mistress pauncefort in ahushed and solemn tone it is not pretty</s>  lady annabel had movedaway</s> the groom returned and said he had met an old man pickingwatercresses and he was the only person who lived in the abbeyexcept his wife and she was bedridden</s>  the old man had promised toadmit them when he had completed his task but not before and thegroom feared it would be some time before he arrived</s> come pauncefort rest yourself on this bench said lady annabelseating herself in the porch and venetia my child come hither tome</s> mamma said venetia what is the name of the gentleman to whom thisabbey belongs</s> lord cadurcis love</s> i should like to know why lord cadurcis lives abroad</s>  said venetiamusingly</s> there are many reasons why persons may choose to quit their nativecountry and dwell in another my love said lady annabel veryquietly some change the climate for their health</s> did lord cadurcis mamma</s>  asked venetia</s> i do not know lord cadurcis dear or anything of him except that heis a very old man and has no family</s> at this moment there was a sound of bars and bolts withdrawn and thefalling of a chain and at length the massy door slowly opened andthe old man appeared and beckoned to them to enter</s> tis eight years come martinmas since i opened this door said theold man and it sticks a bit</s>  you must walk about by yourselves fori have no breath and my mistress is bedridden</s>  there straight downthe cloister you cant miss your way there is not much to see</s> the interior of the abbey formed a quadrangle surrounded by thecloisters and in this inner court was a curious fountain carved withexquisite skill by some gothic artist in one of those capricious moodsof sportive invention that produced those grotesque medleys for whichthe feudal sculptor was celebrated</s>  not a sound was heard except thefall of the fountain and the light echoes that its voice called up</s> the staircase led lady annabel and her party through several smallrooms scantily garnished with ancient furniture in some of whichwere portraits of the family until they at length entered a noblesaloon once the refectory of the abbey and not deficient insplendour though sadly soiled and wormeaten</s>  it was hung withtapestry representing the cartoons of raffael and their still vividcolours contrasted with the faded hangings and the dingy damask of thechairs and sofas</s>  a mass of cromwellian armour was huddled together ina corner of a long monkish gallery with a standard encrusted withdust and a couple of old drums one broken</s>  from one of the windowsthey had a good view of the old walled garden which did nottempt them to enter it it was a wilderness the walks no longerdistinguishable from the rank vegetation of the once cultivated lawnsthe terraces choked up with the unchecked shrubberies and here andthere a leaden statue a goddess or a satyr prostrate and coveredwith moss and lichen</s> it makes me melancholy said lady annabel let us return</s> mamma said venetia are there any ghosts in this abbey</s> you may well ask me love replied lady annabel it seems aspellbound place</s>  but venetia i have often told you there are nosuch things as ghosts</s> is it naughty to believe in ghosts mamma for i cannot helpbelieving in them</s> when you are older and have more knowledge you will not believe inthem venetia replied lady annabel</s> our friends left cadurcis abbey</s>  venetia mounted her donkey hermother walked by her side the sun was beginning to decline when theyagain reached cherbury and the air was brisk</s>  lady annabel was gladto find herself by her fireside in her little terraceroom andvenetia fetching her book read to her mother until their dinner hour</s> chapter iii</s> two serene and innocent years had glided away at cherbury since thismorning ramble to cadurcis abbey and venetia had grown in lovelinessin goodness and intelligence</s>  her lively and somewhat precocious mindhad become greatly developed and though she was only nine years ofage it scarcely needed the affection of a mother to find in her aninteresting and engaging companion</s>  although feminine education waslittle regarded in those days that of lady annabel had been anexception to the general practice of society</s>  she had been broughtup with

favourite but it required all thevigilance of a mother to eradicate the false impressions which suchstudies were continually making on so tender a student and todisenchant by rational discussion the fascinated imagination of herchild</s>  lady annabel endeavoured to find some substitute in the essaysof addison and steele but they required more knowledge of theeveryday world for their enjoyment than an infant bred in suchseclusion could at present afford and at last venetia lost herselfin the wildering pages of clelia and the arcadia which she pored overwith a rapt and ecstatic spirit that

she had an indefinite and painfulconsciousness that she had been early checked in the natural inquirieswhich occur to every child she had insensibly been trained to speakonly of what she saw and when she listened at night to the longivy rustling about the windows and the wild owls hooting about themansion with their pining melancholy voices she might have beenexcused for believing in those spirits which her mother warned her todiscredit or she forgot these mournful impressions in dreams caughtfrom her romantic volumes of bright knights and beautiful damsels</s> only one event of importance had occurred at cherbury during these twoyears if indeed that be not too strong a phrase to use in referenceto an occurrence which occasioned so slight and passing an interest</s> lord cadurcis had

every sunday afternoon the rector of a neighbouring though stillsomewhat distant parish of which the rich living was in the gift ofthe herberts came to perform divine service at cherbury</s>  it was

 cadurcis revived by virtue of her singleglass and the providential cooperation of a subsequent one or two</s> even the cakes and the mountain however would not tempt her son toopen his mouth and this

incidentally introduced muchthat might be urged in its extenuation</s>  there was indeed in thishis milder moment something very winning in his demeanour and ladyannabel deeply regretted that a nature of so much promise and capacityshould by the injudicious treatment of a parent at once fond andviolent afford such slight hopes of future happiness</s>  it was arrangedbetween lord cadurcis and lady annabel that she should lead him to hismother and that he should lament the past and ask her forgivenessso they reentered the room</s>  venetia was listening to a long storyfrom mrs</s>  cadurcis who

pony you wanted i am sure i can manage iti did not think i could</s> as lady annabel thought it was as well that the mother and the sonshould not be immediately thrown together after this storm she kindlyproposed that they should remain and pass the day at cherbury andas plantagenets eyes brightened at the proposal it did not requiremuch trouble to persuade his mother to accede to it</s>  the day that hadcommenced so inauspiciously turned out one of the most agreeableboth to mrs</s>  cadurcis and her child</s>  the two mothers conversedtogether and as mrs</s>  cadurcis was a great workwoman there wasat least one bond of sympathy between her and the tapestry of herhostess</s>  then they all took a stroll in the park and as mrs</s>  cadurciswas not able to walk for any length of time the children werepermitted to stroll about together attended by mistress pauncefortwhile mrs</s>  cadurcis chatting without ceasing detailed to ladyannabel all the history of her life all the details of her variouscomplaints and her economical arrangements and all the secrets of herhusbands treatment of her that favourite subject on which she everwaxed most eloquent</s>  plantagenet equally indulging in confidencewhich with him however was unusual poured all his soul into thecharmed ear of venetia</s>  he told her how he and his mother had lived atmorpeth and how he hated it how poor they had been and how rich heshould be how he loved the abbey and especially the old gallery andthe drums and armour how he had been a dayscholar at a little schoolwhich he abhorred and how he was to go some day to eton of which hewas very proud</s> at length they were obliged to return and when dinner was over thepostchaise was announced</s>  mrs</s>  cadurcis parted from lady annabel withall the warm expressions of a heart naturally kind and generous andplantagenet embraced venetia and promised that the next day he wouldfind his way alone from cadurcis through the wood and come and takeanother walk with her</s> chapter vii</s> this settlement of mrs</s>  cadurcis and her son in the neighbourhoodwas an event of no slight importance in the life of the family atcherbury</s>  venetia at length found a companion of her own age itselfan incident which in its influence upon her character and pursuitswas not to be disregarded</s>  there grew up between the little lord andthe daughter of lady annabel that fond intimacy which not rarelyoccurs in childhood</s>  plantagenet and venetia quickly imbibed for eachother a singular affection not displeasing to lady annabel whoobserved without dissatisfaction the increased happiness of herchild and encouraged by her kindness the frequent visits of the boywho soon learnt the shortest road from the abbey and almost dailyscaled the hill and traced his way through the woods to the hall</s> there was much indeed in the character and the situation of lordcadurcis which interested lady annabel herbert</s>  his mild engagingand affectionate manners when he was removed from the injudiciousinfluence of his mother won upon her feelings she felt for thislone child whom nature had gifted with so soft a heart and with athoughtful mind whose outbreaks not unfrequently attracted her noticewith none to guide him and with only one heart to look up to forfondness and that too one that had already contrived to forfeit therespect even of so young a child</s> yet lady annabel was too sensible of the paramount claims of amother herself indeed too jealous of any encroachment on the fullprivileges of maternal love to sanction in the slightest degree byher behaviour any neglect of mrs</s>  cadurcis by her son</s>  for his saketherefore she courted the society of her new neighbour and althoughmrs</s>  cadurcis offered little to engage lady annabels attention asa companion though she was violent in her temper far from wellinformed and from the society in which in spite of her originalgood birth her later years had passed very far from beingrefined she was not without her good qualities</s>  she was generouskindhearted and grateful not insensible of her own deficienciesand respectable from her misfortunes</s>  lady annabel was one of thosewho always judged individuals rather by their good qualities thantheir bad</s>  with the exception of her violent temper which under thecontrol of lady annabels presence and by the aid of all that kindpersons skilful management mrs</s>  cadurcis generally contrived tobridle her principal faults were those of manner which from theforce of habit every day became less painful</s>  mrs</s>  cadurcis whoindeed was only a child of a larger growth became scarcely lessattached to the herbert family than her son she felt that her lifeunder their influence was happier and serener than of yore thatthere were less domestic broils than in old days that her son wasmore dutiful and as she could not help suspecting though she foundit difficult to analyse the cause herself more amiable</s>  the truthwas lady annabel always treated mrs</s>  cadurcis with studied respectand the children and especially venetia followed her example</s> mrs</s>  cadurcis selfcomplacency was not only less shocked but moregratified than before and this was the secret of her happiness</s>  forno one was more mortified by her rages when they were past than mrs</s> cadurcis herself she felt they compromised her dignity and had losther all moral command over a child whom she loved at the bottom of herheart with a kind of wild passion though she would menace and strikehim and who often precipitated these paroxysms by denying his motherthat duty and affection which were after all the great charm andpride of her existence</s> as mrs</s>  cadurcis was unable to walk to cherbury and as plantagenetsoon fell into the habit of passing every morning at the hall ladyannabel was frequent in her visits to the mother and soon shepersuaded mrs</s>  cadurcis to order the old postchaise regularly onsaturday and remain at cherbury until the following monday by thesemeans both families united together in the chapel at divine servicewhile the presence of dr</s>  masham at their now increased sundaydinner was an incident in the monotonous life of mrs</s>  cadurcis farfrom displeasing to her</s>  the doctor gave her a little news of theneighbourhood and of the country in general amused her with anoccasional anecdote of the queen and the young princesses and alwayslent her the last number of sylvanus urban</s> this weekly visit to cherbury the great personal attention which shealways received there and the frequent morning walks of lady annabelto the abbey effectually repressed on the whole the jealousy whichwas a characteristic of mrs</s>  cadurcis nature and which the constantabsence of her son from her in the mornings might otherwise havefatally developed</s>  but mrs</s>  cadurcis could not resist the convictionthat the herberts were as much her friends as her childs herjealousy was balanced by her gratitude she was daily almost hourlysensible of some kindness of lady annabel for there were a thousandservices in the power of the opulent and ample establishment ofcherbury to afford the limited and desolate household at the abbey</s> living in seclusion it is difficult to refrain from imbibing even astrong regard for our almost solitary companion however incompatiblemay be our pursuits and however our tastes may vary especially whenthat companion is grateful and duly sensible of the condescension ofour intimacy</s>  and so it happened that before a year had elapsed thatvery mrs</s>  cadurcis whose first introduction at cherbury had been sounfavourable to her and from whose temper and manners the elegantdemeanour and the disciplined mind of lady annabel herbert might havebeen excused for a moment recoiling had succeeded in establishing astrong hold upon the affections of her refined neighbour who soughton every occasion her society and omitted few opportunities ofcontributing to her comfort and welfare</s> in the meantime her son was the companion of venetia both in herpastimes and studies</s>  the education of lord cadurcis had received nofurther assistance than was afforded by the little grammarschool atmorpeth where he had passed three or four years as a dayscholar andwhere his mother had invariably taken his part on every occasion thathe had incurred the displeasure of his master</s>  there he had obtainedsome imperfect knowledge of latin yet the boy was fond of readingand had picked up in an odd way more knowledge than might have beensupposed</s>  he had read bakers chronicle and the old universalhistory and plutarch and had turned over in the book room of anold gentleman at morpeth who had been attracted by his intelligencenot a few curious old folios from which he had gleaned nocontemptible store of curious instances of human nature</s>  his guardianwhom he had never seen and who was a great nobleman and lived inlondon had signified to mrs</s>  cadurcis his intention of sending hisward to eton but that time had not yet arrived and mrs</s>  cadurciswho dreaded parting with her son determined to postpone it by everymaternal artifice in her power</s>  at present it would have seemed thather sons intellect was to be left utterly uncultivated for therewas no school in the neighbourhood which he could attend and nooccasional assistance which could be obtained and to the constantpresence of a tutor in the house mrs</s>  cadurcis was not less opposedthan his lordship could have been himself</s> it was by degrees that lord cadurcis became the partner of venetiain her studies</s>  lady annabel had consulted dr</s>  masham about the poorlittle boy whose neglected state she deplored and the good doctorhad offered to ride over to cherbury at least once a week besidessunday provided lady annabel would undertake that his directionsin his absence should be attended to</s>  this her ladyship promisedcheerfully nor had she any difficulty in persuading cadurcis toconsent to the arrangement</s>  he listened with docility and patience toher representation of the fatal effects in his afterlife of hisneglected education of the generous and advantageous offer of dr</s> masham and how cheerfully she would exert herself to assist hisendeavours if plantagenet would willingly submit to her supervision</s> the little lord expressed to her his determination to do all that shedesired and voluntarily promised her that she should never repenther goodness</s>  and he kept his word</s>  so every morning with the fullconcurrence of mrs</s>  cadurcis whose advice and opinion on the affairwere most formally solicited by lady annabel plantagenet arrivedearly at the hall and took his writing and french lessons withvenetia and then they alternately read aloud to lady annabel from thehistories of hooke and echard</s>  when venetia repaired to her drawingcadurcis sat down to his latin exercise and in encouraging andassisting him lady annabel a proficient in italian began herselfto learn the ancient language of the romans</s>  with such a charmingmistress even these latin exercises were achieved</s>  in vain cadurcisafter turning leaf over leaf would look round with a piteous air tohis fair assistant o lady annabel i am sure the word is not in thedictionary lady annabel was in a moment at his side and by somemagic of her fair fingers the word would somehow or other make itsappearance</s>  after a little exposure of this kind plantagenet wouldlabour with double energy until heaving a deep sigh of exhaustionand vexation he would burst forth o lady annabel indeed there isnot a nominative case in this sentence</s>  and then lady annabelwould quit her easel with her pencil in her hand and give all herintellect to the puzzling construction at length she would sayi think plantagenet this must be our nominative case and so italways was</s> thus when wednesday came the longest and most laborious morning ofall lord cadurcis studies and when he neither wrote nor read norlearnt french with venetia but gave up all his soul to dr</s>  masham heusually acquitted himself to that good persons satisfaction who lefthim in general with commendations that were not lost on the pupiland plenty of fresh exercises to occupy him and lady annabel until thenext week</s>  when a year had thus passed away the happiest year yetin lord cadurcis life in spite of all his disadvantages he hadcontrived to make no inconsiderable progress</s>  almost deprived of atutor he had advanced in classical acquirement more than during thewhole of his preceding years of scholarship while his handwritingbegan to become intelligible he could read french with comparativefacility and had turned over many a volume in the wellstored libraryat cherbury</s> chapter viii</s> when the hours of study were past the children with that zest forplay which occupation can alone secure would go forth together andwander in the park</s>  here they had made a little world for themselvesof which no one dreamed for venetia had poured forth all her arcadianlore into the ear of plantagenet and they acted together many ofthe adventures of the romance under the fond names of musidorus andphiloclea</s>  cherbury was arcadia and cadurcis macedon while theintervening woods figured as the forests of thessaly and the breezydowns were the heights of pindus</s>  unwearied was the innocent sportof their virgin imaginations and it was a great treat if venetiaattended by mistress pauncefort were permitted to accompanyplantagenet some way on his return</s>  then they parted with an embracein the woods of thessaly and musidorus strolled home with a heavyheart to his macedonian realm</s> parted from venetia the magic suddenly seemed to cease and musidoruswas instantly transformed into the little lord cadurcis exhausted bythe unconscious efforts of his fancy depressed by the separation fromhis sweet companion and shrinking from the unpoetical reception whichat the best awaited him in his ungenial home</s>  often when thus alonewould he loiter on his way and seat himself on the ridge and watchthe setting sun as its dying glory illumined the turrets of hisancient house and burnished the waters of the lake until the tearsstole down his cheek and yet he knew not why</s>  no thoughts of sorrowhad flitted through his mind nor indeed had ideas of any descriptionoccurred to him</s>  it was a trance of unmeaning abstraction all that hefelt was a mystical pleasure in watching the sunset and a convictionthat if he were not with venetia that which he loved next best wasto be alone</s> the little cadurcis in general returned home moody and silent andhis mother too often irritated by his demeanour indulged in all theexpressions of a quick and offended temper but since his intimacywith the herberts plantagenet had learnt to control his emotionsand often successfully laboured to prevent those scenes of domesticrecrimination once so painfully frequent</s>  there often too was a notefrom lady annabel to mrs</s>  cadurcis or some other slight memorialborne by her son which enlisted all the kind feelings of that lady infavour of her cherbury friends and then the evening was sure to passover in peace and when plantagenet was not thus armed he exertedhimself to be cordial and so on the whole with some skill inmanagement and some trials of temper the mother and child contrivedto live together with far greater comfort than they had of old</s> bedtime was always a great relief to plantagenet for it securedhim solitude</s>  he would lie awake for hours indulging in sweet andunconscious reveries and brooding over the future morn that alwaysbrought happiness</s>  all that he used to sigh for was to be ladyannabels son were he venetias brother then he was sure he nevershould be for a moment unhappy that parting from cherbury and thegloomy evenings at cadurcis would then be avoided</s>  in such a moodand lying awake upon his pillow he sought refuge from the painfulreality that surrounded him in the creative solace of his imagination</s> alone in his little bed cadurcis was venetias brother and heconjured up a thousand scenes in which they were never separated andwherein he always played an amiable and graceful part</s>  yet he lovedthe abbey his painful infancy was not associated with that scene itwas not connected with any of those grovelling commonplaces of hislife from which he had shrunk back with instinctive disgust evenat a very tender age</s>  cadurcis was the spot to which in his mostmiserable moments at morpeth he had always looked forward as theonly chance of emancipation from the distressing scene that surroundedhim</s>  he had been brought up with a due sense of his future positionand although he had ever affected a haughty indifference on thesubject from his disrelish for

somewhat faded colours</s>  there indeed he was loved andcherished there indeed no sound was ever heard no sight ever seenthat could annoy or mortify the high pitch of his unconscious idealbut still even at cherbury he was a child</s>  under the influenceof daily intercourse his tender heart had balanced perhaps evenoutweighed his fiery imagination</s>  that constant yet delicateaffection had softened all his soul he had no time but to be gratefuland to love</s>  he returned home only to muse over their sweet societyand contrast their refined and gentle life with the harsh rude hearththat awaited him</s>  whatever might be his reception at home he wasthrown back for solace on their memory not upon his own heart andhe felt the delightful conviction that tomorrow would renew the spellwhose enchantment had enabled him to endure the present vexation</s>  butnow the magic of that intercourse had ceased after a few days ofrestlessness and repining he discovered that he must find in hisdesolation sterner sources of support than the memory of venetia andthe recollections of the domestic joys of cherbury</s>  it astonishingwith what rapidity the character of cadurcis developed itself insolitude and strange was the contrast between the gentle child whoa few weeks before had looked forward with so much interest toaccompanying venetia to a childish festival and the stern and moodybeing who paced the solitary cloisters of cadurcis and then wouldwithdraw to his lonely chamber and the amusement of a book</s>  he was atthis time deeply interested in purchass pilgrimage one of the fewbooks of which the late lord had not despoiled him</s>  narratives oftravels and voyages always particularly pleased him he had an ideathat he was laying up information which might be useful to himhereafter the cherbury collection was rich in this class of volumesand lady annabel encouraged their perusal</s> in this way many weeks elapsed at the abbey during which the visitsof plantagenet to cherbury were very few</s>  sometimes if the weathercleared for an hour during the morning he would mount his pony andgallop without stopping to the hall</s>  the rapidity of the motionexcited his mind he fancied himself as he embraced venetia somechieftain who had escaped for a moment from his castle to visit hismistress his imagination conjured up a war between the opposingtowers of cadurcis and cherbury and when his mother fell into apassion on his return it passed with him only according to itslength and spirit as a brisk skirmish or a general engagement</s> chapter xiii</s> one afternoon on his return from cherbury plantagenet found the fireextinguished in the little room which he had appropriated to himselfand where he kept his books</s>  as he had expressed his wish to theservant that the fire should be kept up he complained to him of theneglect but was informed in reply that the fire had been allowed togo out by his mothers orders and that she desired in future

table but the sportive and mocking air which he generallyinstinctively assumed on these occasions and which while itirritated his mother more was in reality affected by the boy from asort of nervous desire of preventing these dreadful exposures fromassuming a too tragic tone did not characterise his countenance onthe present occasion on the contrary it was pale but composed andvery serious</s>  mrs</s>  cadurcis after one or two ineffectual attempts tocatch him paused and panted for breath</s>  he took advantage of thismomentary cessation and spoke thus mother i am in no humour

well scolded her waitingwoman sheat length fell asleep</s> the morning brought breakfast but no lord cadurcis in vain were allthe messages of his mother her son would make no reply to them</s>  mrs</s> cadurcis at length personally repaired to his room and knocked atthe door but she was as unsuccessful as the servants she began tothink he would starve and desired the servant to offer from

never been there at all for the bed was unused</s>  mrs</s> cadurcis was frightened out of her life the servants to consoleher assured her that plantagenet must be at cherbury and while shebelieved their representations which were probable she became notonly more composed but resumed her jealousy and sullenness</s>  goneto cherbury indeed</s>  no doubt of it</s>  let him remain at cherbury</s> execrating lady annabel she flung herself into an easy chair anddined alone preparing herself to speak her mind on her sons return</s> the night however did not bring him and mrs</s>  cadurcis began torecur to her alarm</s>  much as she now disliked lady annabel shecould not resist the conviction that her ladyship would not permitplantagenet to remain at cherbury</s>  nevertheless jealous passionateand obstinate she stifled her fears vented her spleen on her unhappydomestics and finally exhausting herself by a storm of passionabout some very unimportant subject again sought refuge in sleep</s> she awoke early in a fright and inquired immediately for her son</s> he had not been seen</s>  she ordered the abbey bell to be sounded sentmessengers throughout the demesne and directed all the offices tobe searched</s>  at first she thought he must have returned and sleptperhaps in a barn then she adopted the more probable conclusion thathe had drowned himself in the lake</s>  then she went into hystericscalled plantagenet her lost darling declared he was the best and mostdutiful of sons and the image of his poor father then abused all theservants and then abused herself</s> about noon she grew quite distracted and rushed about the housewith her hair dishevelled and in a dressinggown looked in all theclosets behind the screens under the chairs into her workbox butstrange to say with no success</s>  then she went off into a swoon andher servants alike frightened about master and mistress mother andson dispatched a messenger immediately to cherbury for intelligenceadvice and assistance</s>  in less than an hours time the messengerreturned and informed them that lord cadurcis had not been atcherbury since two days back but that lady annabel was very sorryto hear that their

where he doubted notto gain some tidings of the fugitive</s>  mrs</s>  cadurcis he found soindisposed that he anticipated the charitable intentions of ladyannabel not to quit her and after having bid them place theirconfidence in providence and his humble exertions he at once departedon his researches</s> in the meantime let us return to the little lord himself</s>  havingsecured the advantage of a long start by the device of turning thekey of his chamber he repaired to the stables and finding no oneto observe him saddled his pony and galloped away without plan orpurpose</s>  an instinctive love of novelty and adventure induced him todirect his course by a road which he had never before pursued andafter two or three miles progress through a wild open country ofbrushwood he found that he had entered that considerable forest whichformed the boundary of many of the views from cadurcis</s>  the afternoonwas clear and still the sun shining in the light blue sky and thewind altogether hushed</s>  on each side of the winding road spread thebright green turf occasionally shaded by picturesque groups ofdoddered oaks</s>  the calm beauty of the sylvan scene wonderfully touchedthe fancy of the youthful fugitive it soothed and gratified him</s>  hepulled up his pony patted its lively neck as if in gratitude forits good service and confident that he could not be successfullypursued indulged in a thousand dreams of robin hood and his merrymen</s>  as for his own position and prospects he gave himself no anxietyabout them satisfied with his escape from a revolting thraldom hismind seemed to take a bound from the difficulty of his situation andthe wildness of the scene and he felt himself a man and one toowhom nothing could daunt or appal</s> soon the road itself quite disappeared and vanished in a completeturfy track but the continuing marks of cartwheels assured him thatit was a thoroughfare although he was now indeed journeying in theheart of a forest of oaks and he doubted not it would lead to sometown or village or at any rate to some farmhouse</s>  towards sunset hedetermined to make use of the remaining light and pushed on apacebut it soon grew so dark that he found it necessary to resume hiswalking pace from fear of the overhanging branches and the trunks offelled trees which occasionally crossed his way</s> notwithstanding the probable prospect of passing his night in theforest our little adventurer did not lose heart</s>  cadurcis was anintrepid child and when in the company of those with whom he was notfamiliar and free from those puerile associations to which those whohad known and lived with him long were necessarily subject he wouldassume a staid and firm demeanour unusual with one of such tenderyears</s>  a light in the distance was now not only a signal thatthe shelter he desired was at hand but reminded him that it wasnecessary by his assured port to prove that he was not unused totravel alone and that he was perfectly competent and qualified to behis own master</s> as he drew nearer the lights multiplied and the moon which now roseover the forest showed to him that the trees retiring on both sidesto some little distance left a circular plot of ground on which werenot only the lights which had at first attracted his attention butthe red flames of a watchfire round which some dark figures hadhitherto been clustered</s>  the sound of horses feet had disturbed themand the fire was now more and more visible</s>  as cadurcis approached heobserved some low tents and in a few minutes he was in the centre

surrounded inan instant but only with women and children for the gipsymen neverimmediately appear</s>  they smiled with their bright eyes and the flamesof the watchfire threw a lurid glow over their

round his head was twisteda red handkerchief which perhaps might not have looked like aturban on a countenance less oriental</s> what would the young master</s>  inquired the gipsyman in a voice farfrom disagreeable and with a gesture of courtesy but at the sametime he shot a scrutinising glance first at plantagenet and then athis pony</s> i would remain with you said cadurcis that is if you will letme</s> the gipsyman made a sign to the women and plantagenet was liftedby them off his pony before he could be aware of their purpose thechildren led the pony away and the gipsyman conducted plantagenet tothe fire where an old woman sat presiding over the mysteries of anenormous fleshpot</s>  immediately his fellows who had originally beenclustered around it reappeared fresh blocks and

affectedher circulation leaving it after this formal intimation entirely tothe mother to take those steps in reference to the cause whatever itmight be which she should deem expedient</s> in the

wasrather surprised at her altered appearance when it first met herglance in the mirror but scarcely made any observation on the loss ofher locks</s>  during this interval the mind of venetia had been

her first disobedience or rather her firstdeception of her mother in reference to this very subject hadbrought and brought so swiftly on its retributive wings suchdisastrous consequences that any allusion to lady annabel wasrestrained by a species of superstitious fear against which venetiacould not contend</s>  then her father was either dead or living</s>  that wascertain</s>  if dead it was clear that his memory however cherished byhis relict was associated with feelings too keen to admit of anyother but solitary indulgence</s>  if living there was a mysteryconnected with her parents a

upon her daughter</s>  no loverever watched with such devotion the wants or even the caprices of hismistress</s>  a thousand times every day venetia found herself expressingher fondness and her gratitude</s>  it seemed that the late dreadfulcontingency of losing her daughter had developed in lady annabelsheart even additional powers of maternal devotion and venetia thefond and grateful

absence had surreptitiously invaded the sanctuary ofher secret sorrow</s> chapter x</s> when venetia had so far recovered that leaning on her mothers armshe could resume her walks upon the terrace doctor masham persuadedhis friends as a slight and not unpleasant change of scene to payhim a visit at marringhurst</s>  since the chamber scene indeed ladyannabels tie to cherbury was much weakened</s>  there were certainfeelings of pain and fear and mortification now associated withthat place which she could not bear to dwell upon and which greatlybalanced those sentiments of refuge and repose of peace and lovewith which the old hall in her mind was heretofore connected</s> venetia ever adopted the slightest intimations of a wish on the partof her mother and so she readily agreed to fall into the arrangement</s> it was rather a long and rough journey to marringhurst for they wereobliged to use the old chariot but venetia forgot her fatigues inthe cordial welcome of their host whose sparkling countenance wellexpressed the extreme gratification their arrival occasioned him</s> all that the tenderest solicitude could devise for the agreeableaccommodation of the invalid had been zealously concerted and theconstant influence of dr</s>  mashams cheerful mind was as beneficial tolady annabel as to her daughter</s>  the season was gay the place waspleasant and although they were only a few miles from home in ahouse with which they were familiar and their companion one whom theyhad known intimately all their lives and of late almost daily seenyet such is the magic of a change in our habits however slight andof the usual theatre of their custom that this visit to marringhurstassumed quite the air of an adventure and seemed at first almostinvested with the charm and novelty of travel</s> the surrounding country which though verdant was flat was welladapted to the limited exertions and still feeble footsteps of aninvalid and venetia began to study botany with the doctor who indeedwas not very profound in his attainments in this respect but knewquite enough to amuse his scholar</s>  by degrees also as her strengthdaily increased they extended their walks and at length she evenmounted her pony and was fast recovering her elasticity both of bodyand mind</s>  there were also many pleasant books with which she wasunacquainted a cabinet of classic coins prints and pictures</s>  shebecame too interested in the doctors rural pursuits would watchhim with his angle and already meditated a revolution in his garden</s> so time on the whole flew cheerfully on certainly withoutany weariness and the day seldom passed that they did not allcongratulate themselves on the pleasant and profitable change</s> in the meantime venetia when alone still recurred to that idea thatwas now so firmly rooted in her mind that it was quite out of thepower of any social discipline to divert her attention from it</s>  shewas often the sole companion of the doctor and she had long resolvedto seize a favourable opportunity to appeal to him on the subject ofher father</s>  it so happened that she was walking alone with him onemorning in the neighbourhood of marringhurst

times and revived old associations</s>  his visit tothe hall was looked forward to with interest</s>  he did not long keep hisformer friends in suspense for although he was not uninfluenced bysome degree of embarrassment from the consciousness of neglect on hisside rendered more keen now that he again found himself in the sceneendeared by the remembrance of their kindness he was

beautyunfulfilled although its expression was peculiar and less pleasingthan impressive</s>  his long dark locks shaded a pale and lofty brow thatwell became a cast of features delicately moulded yet reserved andhaughty and perhaps even somewhat scornful</s>  his figure had set into aform of remarkable slightness and elegance and distinguished forits symmetry</s>  altogether his general mien was

which he auguredthe most complete success</s>  attracted by the promising talents and thepremature character of his ward he had spared more time to assist thedevelopment of his mind and the formation of his manners than mighthave been expected from a minister of state</s>  his hopes indeed restedwith confidence on his youthful relative and he looked forward withno common emotion to the moment when he should have the honour ofintroducing to public life one calculated to confer so much crediton his tutor and shed so much lustre on his party</s>  the reader willtherefore not be surprised if at this then unrivalled period ofpolitical excitement when the existence of our colonial empire wasat stake cadurcis with his impetuous feelings had imbibed totheir fullest extent all the plans

as little inclined to recognise theexistence of ability as of truth</s> as lord cadurcis slowly directed his way through the woods and park ofcherbury past years recurred to him like a faint yet pleasing dream</s> among these meads and bowers had glided away the only happy years ofhis boyhood the only period of his early life to which he could lookback without disgust</s>  he recalled the secret exultation with which incompany with his poor mother he had first repaired to cadurcis aboutto take possession of what to his inexperienced imagination thenappeared a vast and noble inheritance

venerable galleries and solemncloisters and musing over the memory of an ancient and illustriousancestry had he forgotten those bitter passages of daily existenceso humbling to his vanity and so harassing to his heart</s>  ho had beheldthat morn after an integral of many years the tomb of his mother</s> that simple and solitary monument had revived and impressed upon him aconviction that too

which contingency he most desired to meet or to escape fromher</s>  he almost repented his return to cadurcis and yet to see venetiaagain he felt must be exquisite pleasure</s>  influenced by these feelingshe arrived at the hall steps and so dismounting and giving his horseto his groom cadurcis with a palpitating heart and faltering handformally rang the bell of that hall which in old days he entered atall seasons without ceremony</s> never perhaps did a man feel more nervous he grew pale paler eventhan usual and his whole frame trembled as the approaching footstepof the servant assured

obliged to enter</s>  he stopped for a moment in the hall underthe pretence of examining the old familiar scene but it was merely tocollect himself for his sight was clouded spoke to the old servantto

announced</s> the effort however must be made it was too late to recede and lordcadurcis entering the terraceroom extended his hand to lady annabelherbert</s>  she was not in the least changed but looked as beautiful andserene as usual</s>  her salutation though far from deficient in warmthwas a little more dignified than that which plantagenet rememberedbut still her presence reassured him and while he pressed her handwith earnestness he contrived to murmur forth with pleasing emotionhis delight at again meeting her</s>  strange to say in the absorbingagitation of the moment all thought of venetia had vanished andit was when he had turned and beheld a maiden of the most exquisitebeauty that his vision had ever lighted on who had just risen fromher seat and was at the moment saluting him

interrogations which required no extraordinaryexertion of his lordships intellect to answer but to which henevertheless contrived to give inconsistent and contradictoryresponses cadurcis in time recovered himself sufficiently to maintaina fair though not very brilliant conversation and even venturedoccasionally to address an observation to venetia who was seated ather work perfectly composed but who replied to all his remarks withthe same sweet voice and artless simplicity which had characterisedher childhood though time and thought had by their blendedinfluence perhaps somewhat deprived her of that wild grace andsparkling gaiety for which she was once so eminent</s> these great disenchanters of humanity if indeed they had stolen awaysome of the fascinating qualities of infancy had

returned to himwith unusual vigour wonderfully served him</s>  there was scarcely anindividual of whom he did not contrive to inquire from dr</s>  masham tomistress pauncefort he was resolved to show that if he had neglectedhe had at least not forgotten them</s>  nor did he exhibit the slightestindication of terminating his visit so that lady annabel aware thathe was alone at the abbey and that he could have no engagement in theneighbourhood could not refrain from inviting him to remain and dinewith them</s>  the invitation was accepted without hesitation</s>  in duecourse of time cadurcis attended the ladies in their walk it was adelightful stroll in the park though he felt some slight emotion whenhe found himself addressing venetia by the title of miss herbert</s> when he had exhausted all the topics of local interest he had a greatdeal to say about himself in answer to the inquiries of lady annabel</s> he spoke with so much feeling and simplicity of his first days ateton and the misery he experienced on first quitting cherbury thathis details could not fail of being agreeable to those whose naturalselfesteem they so agreeably mattered</s>  then he dwelt upon his casualacquaintance with london society and lady annabel was gratified toobserve from many incidental observations that his principles werein every respect of the right tone and that he had zealously enlistedhimself in the ranks of that national party who opposed themselvesto the disorganising opinions then afloat</s>  he spoke of his impendingresidence at the university with the affectionate anticipations whichmight have been expected from a devoted child of the ancient andorthodox institutions of his country and seemed perfectly impressedwith the responsible duties for which he was destined as anhereditary legislator of england</s>  on the whole his carriage andconversation afforded a delightful evidence of a pure and earnestand frank and gifted mind that had acquired at an early age much ofthe mature and fixed character of manhood without losing anythingof that boyish sincerity and simplicity too often the penalty ofexperience</s> the dinner passed in pleasant

 he ventured to hope that ladyannabel and miss herbert might accompany him and it was arranged thathis wish should be gratified</s>  the evening drew on apace and ladyannabel was greatly pleased when lord cadurcis expressed his wish toremain for their evening prayers</s>  he was indeed sincerely religiousand as he knelt in the old chapel that had been the hallowed sceneof his boyish devotions he offered his ardent thanksgivings to hiscreator who had mercifully kept his soul pure and true and allowedhim after so long an estrangement from the sweet spot of hischildhood once more to mingle his supplications with his kind andvirtuous friends</s> influenced by the solemn sounds still lingering in his ear cadurcisbade them farewell for the night with an earnestness of manner anddepth of

again after so long an interval andfound her early prognostics so fairly so completely fulfilled andwatched his conduct and conversation exhibiting alike a wellinformedmind an obliging temper and what

him her soninlaw and she detectedwith lively satisfaction the immediate impression which venetia hadmade upon his heart for indeed it should not be forgotten thatalthough lady annabel was still young

quitting this world withoutleaving her child a protector</s>  to doctor masham from whom ladyannabel had no secrets she confided in time these happy but coverthopes and he was not less anxious than herself for their fulfilment</s> since the return of cadurcis the doctor contrived to be a morefrequent visitor at the hall than usual and he lost no opportunity ofsilently advancing the object of his

somewhat moreperplexed him</s>  venetia indeed had entirely fallen into her old habitsof intimacy and frankness with plantagenet she was as affectionateand as unembarrassed as in former days and almost as gay for hispresence and companionship had in a great degree insensibly removedthat stillness and gravity which had gradually influenced her mind andconduct</s>  but in that conduct there was and he observed it with somedegree of mortification a total absence of the consciousness of beingthe object of the passionate admiration of another</s>  she treated lordcadurcis as a brother she much loved who had returned to his homeafter a long absence</s>  she liked to listen to his conversation to hearof his adventures to consult over his plans</s>  his arrival calleda smile to her face and his departure for the night was alwaysalleviated by some allusion to their meeting on the morrow</s>  but manyan ardent gaze on the part of cadurcis and many a phrase of emotionpassed unnoticed and unappreciated</s>  his gallantry was entirelythrown away or if observed only occasioned a pretty stare at theunnecessary trouble he gave himself or the strange ceremony whichshe supposed an acquaintance with society had taught him</s>  cadurcisattributed this reception of his veiled and delicate overtures toher ignorance of the world and though he sighed for as passionatea return to his strong feelings as the sentiments which animatedhimself he was on the whole not displeased but rather interested bythese indications of a pure and unsophisticated spirit</s> chapter iv</s> cadurcis had proposed and lady annabel had seconded the propositionwith eager satisfaction that they should seek some day at the abbeywhatever hospitality it might offer dr</s>  masham was to be of theparty which was indeed one of those fanciful expeditions where thesame companions though they meet at all times without restraintand with every convenience of life seek increased amusement in thenovelty of a slight change of habits</s>  with the aid of the neighbouringtown of southport cadurcis had made preparations for his friends notentirely unworthy of them though he affected to the last all theair

mostsevere hardships</s> the morning of this eventful day broke as beautifully as the precedingones</s>  autumn had seldom been more gorgeous than this year</s>  although hewas to play the host cadurcis would not deprive himself of his usualvisit to the hall and he appeared there at an early hour to accompanyhis guests who were to ride over to the abbey to husband all theirenergies for their

he arrived at last on his stoutsteed in his accustomed cheerful mood</s>  here was a party of pleasurewhich all agreed must be pleasant no strangers to amuse or to beamusing but formed merely of four human beings who spent every day oftheir lives in each others society between whom there was the mostcomplete sympathy and the most cordial goodwill</s> by noon they were all mounted on their steeds and though the air waswarmed by a meridian sun shining in a clear sky there was a gentlebreeze abroad sweet and grateful and moreover they soon entered thewood and enjoyed the shelter of its verdant shade</s>  the abbey lookedmost picturesque when they first burst upon it the nearer and woodedhills which formed its immediate background just tinted by thegolden pencil of autumn while the meads of the valley were stillemerald green and the stream now lost now winding glitteredhere and there in the sun and gave a life and sprightliness to thelandscape which exceeded even the effect of the more distant andexpansive lake</s> they were received at the abbey by mistress pauncefort who hadpreceded them and who welcomed them with a complacent smile</s>  cadurcishastened to assist lady annabel to dismount and was a little confusedbut very pleased when she assured him she needed no assistance butrequested him to take care of venetia</s>  he was just in time to receiveher in his arms where she found herself without the slightestembarrassment</s>  the coolness of the cloisters was grateful after theirride and they lingered and looked upon the old fountain and felt thefreshness of its fall

cannot help thinking as it mayprobably turn out as you yourself believe it will turn out thatit is as well that we have been separated for this interval</s>  it hasafforded me opportunities for

dear doctor i respect your opinion morethan that of any man living but nobody nothing can persuade me thati am not as intimately acquainted with venetias character with allher rare virtues as if we had never separated</s> i do not doubt it said the doctor high as you may pitch yourestimate you cannot overvalue her</s> then why should we not marry</s> because my dear friend although you may be perfectly acquaintedwith venetia you cannot be perfectly acquainted with yourself</s> how so</s>  exclaimed lord cadurcis in a tone of surprise perhaps alittle indignant</s> because it is impossible</s>  no young man of eighteen ever possessedsuch precious knowledge</s>  i esteem and admire you i give you everycredit for a good heart and a sound head but it is impossible atyour time of

v</s> the reappearance of the ladies at the end of the cloister terminatedthis conversation the result of which was rather to confirm lordcadurcis in his resolution of instantly urging his suit than

indeed shelooked very captivating with a pastoral hat then much in fashionand a dress as simple and as sylvan both showing to admirableadvantage her long descending hair and her agile and springy figure</s> cadurcis proposed that they should ramble over the abbey he talked ofprojected alterations as if he really had the power immediately toeffect them and was desirous of obtaining their

with the prejudices or opinionsusually imbibed or professed by the class to which he belonged</s>  whileyet a boy marmion herbert afforded many indications of possessing amind alike visionary and inquisitive and both although not in anequal degree sceptical and creative</s>  nature had gifted him withprecocious talents and with a temperament essentially poetic hewas nevertheless a great student</s>  his early reading originally byaccident and afterwards by an irresistible inclination had fallenamong the works of the english freethinkers with all their errorsa profound and vigorous race and much superior to the frenchphilosophers who were after all only their pupils and theirimitators</s>  while his juvenile studies and in some degree thepredisposition of his mind had thus prepared him to doubt and finallyto challenge the propriety of all that was established and receivedthe poetical and stronger bias of his mind enabled him quickly tosupply the place of everything he would remove and destroy and farfrom being the victim of those frigid and indifferent feelingswhich must ever be the portion of the mere doubter herbert on thecontrary looked forward with ardent and sanguine enthusiasm to aglorious and ameliorating future which should amply compensate andconsole a misguided and unhappy race for the miserable past andthe painful and dreary present</s>  to those therefore who could notsympathise with his views it will be seen that herbert in attemptingto fulfil them became not merely passively noxious from his examplebut actively mischievous from his exertions</s>  a mere sceptic he wouldhave been perhaps merely pitied a sceptic with a peculiar faith ofhis own which he was resolved to promulgate herbert became odious</s>  asolitary votary of obnoxious opinions herbert would have been lookedupon only as a madman but the moment he attempted to make proselyteshe rose into a conspirator against society</s> young irresistibly prepossessing in his appearance with greateloquence crude but considerable knowledge an ardent imaginationand a subtle mind and a generous and passionate soul under anycircumstances he must have obtained and exercised influence even ifhis creator had not also bestowed upon him a spirit of indomitablecourage but these great gifts of nature being combined with accidentsof fortune scarcely less qualified to move mankind high rank vastwealth and a name of traditionary glory it will not be esteemedsurprising that marmion herbert at an early period should haveattracted around him many enthusiastic disciples</s> at christchurch whither he repaired at an unusually early agehis tutor was doctor masham and the profound respect and singularaffection with which that able learned and amiable man earlyinspired his pupil for a time controlled the spirit of herbert orrather confined its workings to so limited a sphere that the resultswere neither dangerous to society nor himself</s>  perfectly comprehendingand appreciating the genius of the youth entrusted to his chargedeeply interested in his spiritual as well as worldly welfare andstrongly impressed with the importance of enlisting his pupilsenergies in favour of that existing order both moral and religiousin the truth and indispensableness of which he was a sincere believerdoctor masham omitted no opportunity of combating the heresies of theyoung inquirer and as the tutor equally by talent experience andlearning was a competent champion of the great cause to which he wasdevoted his zeal and ability for a time checked the development ofthose opinions of which he witnessed the menacing influence overherbert with so much fear and anxiety</s>  the college life of marmionherbert therefore passed in ceaseless controversy with his tutorand as he possessed among many other noble qualities a high andphilosophic sense of justice he did not consider himself authorisedwhile a doubt remained on his own mind actively to promulgate thoseopinions of the propriety and necessity of which he scarcely everceased to be persuaded</s>  to this cause it must be mainly attributedthat herbert was not expelled the university for had he pursued therethe course of which his cruder career at eton had given promise therecan be little doubt that some flagrant outrage of the opinions heldsacred in that great seat of orthodoxy would have quickly removed himfrom the salutary sphere of their control</s> herbert quitted oxford in his nineteenth year yet inferior tofew that he left there even among the most eminent in classicalattainments and with a mind naturally profound practised in all thearts of ratiocination</s>  his general knowledge also was considerableand he was a proficient in those scientific pursuits which were thenrare</s>  notwithstanding his great fortune and position his departurefrom the university was not a signal with him for that abandonment tothe world and that unbounded selfenjoyment naturally so tempting toyouth</s>  on the contrary herbert shut himself up in his magnificentcastle devoted to solitude and study</s>  in his splendid library heconsulted the sages of antiquity and conferred with them on thenature of existence and of the social duties while in his laboratoryor his dissectingroom he occasionally flattered himself he mightdiscover the great secret which had perplexed generations</s>  theconsequence of a year passed in this severe discipline wasunfortunately a complete recurrence to those opinions that he hadearly imbibed and which now seemed fixed in his conviction beyond thehope or chance of again faltering</s>  in politics a violent republicanand an advocate certainly a disinterested one of a complete equalityof property and conditions utterly objecting to the very foundationof our moral system and especially a strenuous antagonist ofmarriage which he taught himself to esteem not only as an unnaturaltie but as eminently unjust towards that softer sex who had beenso long the victims of man discarding as a mockery the receivedrevelation of the divine will and if no longer an atheistsubstituting merely for such an outrageous dogma a subtle and shadowyplatonism doctrines however which herbert at least had acquired bya profound study of the works of their great founder the pupil ofdoctor masham at length deemed himself qualified to enter that worldwhich he was resolved to regenerate prepared for persecution andsteeled even to martyrdom</s> but while the doctrines of the philosopher had been forming thespirit of the poet had not been inactive</s>  loneliness after all thebest of muses had stimulated the creative faculty of his being</s> wandering amid his solitary woods and glades at all hours and seasonsthe wild and beautiful apparitions of nature had appealed to asympathetic soul</s>  the stars and winds the pensive sunset and thesanguine break of morn the sweet solemnity of night the ancienttrees and the light and evanescent flowers all signs and sights andsounds of loveliness and power fell on a ready eye and a responsiveear</s>  gazing on the beautiful he longed to create it</s>  then it was thatthe two passions which seemed to share the being of herbert appearedsimultaneously to assert their sway and he resolved to call in hismuse to the assistance of his philosophy</s> herbert celebrated that fond world of his imagination which he wishedto teach men to love</s>  in stanzas glittering with refined images andresonant with subtle symphony he called into creation that society ofimmaculate purity and unbounded enjoyment which he believed was thenatural inheritance of unshackled man</s>  in the hero he pictured aphilosopher young and gifted as himself in the heroine his idea ofa perfect woman</s>  although all those peculiar doctrines of herbertwhich undisguised must have excited so much odium were more orless developed and inculcated in this work nevertheless they werenecessarily so veiled by the highly spiritual and metaphoricallanguage of the poet that it required some previous acquaintance withthe system enforced to be able to detect and recognise the esotericspirit of his muse</s>  the public read only the history of an ideal worldand of creatures of exquisite beauty told in language that alikedazzled their fancy and captivated their ear</s>  they were lost in adelicious maze of metaphor and music and were proud to acknowledgean addition to the glorious catalogue of their poets in a young andinteresting member of their aristocracy</s> in the meanwhile herbert entered that great world that had longexpected him and hailed his advent with triumph</s>  how long might haveelapsed before they were roused by the conduct of herbert to theerror under which they were labouring as to his character it isnot difficult to conjecture but before he could commence thosephilanthropic exertions which apparently absorbed him he encounteredan individual who most unconsciously put his philosophy not merely tothe test but partially even to the rout and this was lady annabelsidney</s>  almost as new to the world as himself and not less admiredher unrivalled

frightened by its indications butthis happy union had dissipated all his fears</s>  he would not believe inany other than a future career for him alike honourable and happy andhe trusted that if any wild thoughts still lingered in herberts mindthat they would clear off by the same literary process so thatthe utmost ill consequences of his immature opinions might be anoccasional line that the wise would have liked to blot and yet whichthe unlettered might scarcely be competent to comprehend</s>  mr</s>  and ladyannabel herbert departed after the ceremony to his castle and doctormasham to marringhurst a valuable living in another county to whichhis pupil had just presented him</s> some months after this memorable event rumours reached the ear of thegood doctor that all was not as satisfactory as he could desire inthat establishment in the welfare of which he naturally took solively an interest</s>  herbert was in the habit of corresponding with therector of marringhurst and his first letters were full of details asto his happy life and his perfect consent but gradually these detailshad been considerably abridged and the correspondence assumed chieflya literary or philosophical character</s>  lady annabel however wasalways mentioned with regard and an intimation had been duly givento the doctor that she was in a delicate and promising situation andthat they were both alike anxious that he should christen their child</s> it did not seem very surprising to the good doctor who was a man ofthe world that a husband six months after marriage should notspeak of the memorable event with all the fulness and fondness ofthe honeymoon and being one of those happy tempers that alwaysanticipate the best he dismissed from his mind as vain gossip andidle exaggerations the ominous whispers that occasionally reachedhim</s> immediately after the christmas ensuing his marriage the herbertsreturned to london and the doctor who happened to be a short timein the metropolis paid them a visit</s>  his observations were far fromunsatisfactory it was certainly too evident that marmion was nolonger enamoured of lady annabel but he treated her apparently withcourtesy and even cordiality</s>  the presence of dr</s>  masham tendedperhaps a little to revive old feelings for he was as much afavourite with the wife as with the husband but on the wholethe doctor quitted them with an easy heart and sanguine that theinteresting and impending event would in all probability reviveaffection on the part of herbert or at least afford lady annabel theonly substitute for a husbands heart</s> in due time the doctor heard from herbert that his wife had gonedown into the country but was sorry to observe that herbert did notaccompany her</s>  even this disagreeable impression was removed by aletter shortly after received from herbert dated from the castleand written in high spirits informing him that annabel had made himthe happy father of the most beautiful little girl in the world</s> during the ensuing three months mr</s>  herbert though he resumed hisresidence in london paid frequent visits to the castle where ladyannabel remained and his occasional correspondence though couchedin a careless vein still on the whole indicated a cheerful spiritthough ever and anon were sarcastic observations as to the felicity ofthe married state which he said was an undoubted blessing as itkept a man out of all scrapes though unfortunately under the penaltyof his total idleness and inutility in life</s>  on the whole howeverthe reader may judge of the astonishment of doctor masham when incommon with the world very shortly after the receipt of this lettermr</s>  herbert having previously proceeded to london and awaiting aswas said the daily arrival of his wife and child his former tutorlearned that lady annabel accompanied only by pauncefort and venetiahad sought her fathers roof declaring that circumstances hadoccurred which rendered it quite impossible that she could live withmr</s>  herbert any longer and entreating his succour and parentalprotection</s> never was such a hubbub in the world</s>  in vain herbert claimed hiswife and expressed his astonishment declaring that he had partedfrom her with the expression of perfect kind feeling on both sides</s> no answer was given to his letter and no explanation of any kindconceded him</s>  the world universally declared lady annabel an injuredwoman and trusted that she would eventually have the good sense andkindness to gratify them by revealing the mystery while herberton the contrary was universally abused and shunned avoided by hisacquaintances and denounced as the most depraved of men</s> in this extraordinary state of affairs herbert acted in a mannerthe best calculated to secure his happiness and the very worst topreserve his character</s>  having ostentatiously shown himself in everypublic place and courted notice and inquiry by every means in hispower to prove that he was not anxious to conceal himself or avoidany inquiry he left the country free at last to pursue that careerto which he had always aspired and in which he had been checked bya blunder from the consequences of which he little expected thathe should so speedily and strangely emancipate himself</s>  it was in abeautiful villa on the lake of geneva that he finally establishedhimself and there for many years he employed himself in thepublication of a series of works which whether they were poetry orprose imaginative or investigative all tended to the same consistentpurpose namely the fearless and unqualified promulgation of thoseopinions on the adoption of which he sincerely believed the happinessof mankind depended and the opposite principles to which in his owncase had been productive of so much mortification and misery</s> his works which were published in england were little read anduniversally decried</s>  the critics were always hard at work provingthat he was no poet and demonstrating in the most logical mannerthat he was quite incapable of reasoning on the commonest topic</s>  inaddition to all this his ignorance was selfevident and though hewas very fond of quoting greek they doubted whether he was capable ofreading the original authors</s>  the general impression of the englishpublic after the lapse of some years was that herbert was anabandoned being of profligate habits opposed to all the institutionsof society that kept his infamy in check and an avowed atheist andas scarcely any one but a sympathetic spirit ever read a line hewrote for indeed the very sight of his works was pollution it is notvery wonderful that this opinion was so generally prevalent</s>  a calminquirer might perhaps have suspected that abandoned profligacy isnot very compatible with severe study and that an author is seldomloose in his life even if he be licentious in his writings</s>  a calminquirer might perhaps have been of opinion that a solitary sagemay be the antagonist of a priesthood without absolutely denying theexistence of a god but there never are calm inquirers</s>  the world onevery subject however unequally is divided into parties and even inthe case of herbert and his writings those who admired his geniusand the generosity of his soul were not content without advocatingprincipally out of pique to his adversaries his extreme opinions onevery subject moral political and religious</s> besides it must be confessed there was another circumstance whichwas almost as fatal to herberts character in england as his loose andheretical opinions</s>  the travelling english during their visits togeneva found out that their countryman solaced or enlivened hissolitude by unhallowed ties</s>  it is a habit to which very young menwho are separated from or deserted by their wives occasionally haverecourse</s>  wrong no doubt as most things are but it is to be hopedvenial at least in the case of any man who is not also an atheist</s> this unfortunate mistress of herbert was magnified into a seragliothe most extraordinary tales of the voluptuous life of one whogenerally at his studies outwatched the stars were rife in englishsociety and hoary marquises and stripling dukeswho were either protecting opera dancers or still worse makinglove to their neighbours wives either looked grave when the name ofherbert was mentioned in female society or affectedly confused as ifthey could a tale unfold were they not convinced that the sense ofpropriety among all present was infinitely superior to their sense ofcuriosity</s> the only person to whom herbert communicated in england was doctormasham</s>  he wrote to him immediately on his establishment at geneva ina calm yet sincere and serious tone as if it were useless to dwelltoo fully on the past</s>  yet he declared although now that it was allover he avowed his joy at the interposition of his destiny and theopportunity which he at length possessed of pursuing the career forwhich he was adapted that he had to his knowledge given his wifeno cause of offence which could authorise her conduct</s>  as for hisdaughter he said he should not be so cruel as to tear her fromher mothers breast though if anything could induce him to suchbehaviour it would be the malignant and ungenerous menace of hiswifes relatives that they would oppose his preferred claim tothe guardianship of his child on the plea of his immoral life andatheistical opinions</s>  with reference to pecuniary arrangements ashis chief seat was entailed on male heirs he proposed that his wifeshould take up her abode at cherbury an estate which had been settledon her and her children at her marriage and which therefore woulddescend to venetia</s>  finally he expressed his satisfaction that theneighbourhood of marringhurst would permit his good and still faithfulfriend to cultivate the society and guard over the welfare of his wifeand daughter</s> during the first ten years of herberts exile for such indeed itmight be considered the doctor maintained with him a rare yet regularcorrespondence but after that time a public event occurred anda revolution took place in herberts life which terminated allcommunication between them a termination occasioned however by sucha simultaneous conviction of its absolute necessity that it was notattended by any of those painful communications which are too oftenthe harrowing forerunners of a formal disruption of ancient ties</s> this event was the revolt of the american colonies and thisrevolution in herberts career his junction with the rebels againsthis native country</s>  doubtless it was not without a struggle perhapsa pang that herbert resolved upon a line of conduct to which itmust assuredly have required the strongest throb of his cosmopolitansympathy and his amplest definition of philanthropy to have impelledhim</s>  but without any vindictive feelings towards england for he everprofessed and exercised charity towards his enemies attributing theirconduct entirely to their ignorance and prejudice upon this step henevertheless felt it his duty to decide</s>  there seemed in the openingprospects of america in a world still new which had borrowed fromthe old as it were only so much civilisation as was necessary tocreate and to maintain order there seemed in the circumstances of itsboundless territory and the total absence of feudal institutions andprejudices so fair a field for the practical introduction of thoseregenerating principles to which herbert had devoted all the thoughtand labour of his life that he resolved after long and perhapspainful meditation to sacrifice every feeling and future interest toits fulfilment</s>  all idea of ever returning to his native country evenwere it only to mix his ashes with the generations of his ancestorsall hope of reconciliation with his wife or of pressing to hisheart that daughter often present to his tender fancy and

regiment for therepublic and the offer was accepted and he was enrolled among thecitizens</s>  all this occurred about the time that the cadurcis familyfirst settled at the abbey and this narrative

with a morbid apprehension from society to whichnothing could persuade her she was not an object either of odium orimpertinent curiosity she finally resolved to visit weymouth then asmall and secluded

merely amiable andsomewhat narrowminded being that she supposed had not been investedwith those brilliant and commanding qualities which she felt couldalone master her esteem</s>  often had she in those abstracted hoursplayed with her imagination in combining the genius of her father withthe soft heart of that friend to whom she was so deeply attached</s>  shehad wished in her reveries that cadurcis might have been a greatman that he might have existed in an atmosphere of glory amid theplaudits and admiration of his race and that then he might haveturned from all that fame so dear to

the rest remained below and drank their winewith the freedom not unusual in those days lord cadurcis among themalthough it was not his habit</s>  but he was not convivial though henever passed the bottle untouched</s>  he was in one of those dark humoursof which there was a latent spring in his nature but which in olddays had been kept in check by his simple life his inexperiencedmind and the general kindness that greeted him and which nothing butthe caprice and perversity of his mother could occasionally develope</s> but since the great revolution in his position since circumstanceshad made him alike acquainted with his nature and had brought allsociety to acknowledge its superiority since he had gained and felthis irresistible power and had found all the world and all theglory of it at his feet these moods had become more frequent</s>  theslightest reaction in the selfcomplacency that was almost unceasinglystimulated by the applause of applauded men and the love of theloveliest women instantly took the shape and found refuge in theimmediate form of the darkest spleen generally indeed brooding insilence and if speaking expressing itself only in sarcasm</s>  cadurciswas indeed as we have already described him the spoiled child ofsociety a froward and petted darling not always to be conciliated bykindness but furious when neglected or controlled</s>  he was habituatedto triumph it had been his lot to come to see and to conquer eventhe procrastination of certain success was intolerable to him hisenergetic volition could not endure a check</s>  to lady annabel herbertindeed he was not exactly what he was to others there was a spellin old associations from which he unconsciously could not emancipatehimself and from which it was his opinion he honoured her in notdesiring to be free</s>  he had his reasons for wishing to regain his oldhis natural influence over her heart he did not doubt for an instantthat if cadurcis sued success must follow the condescending effort</s> he had sued and he had been met with coldness almost with disdain</s> he had addressed her in those terms of tenderness which experiencehad led him to believe were

narrowrigid mind that had repudiated ties that every other woman in theworld would have gloried to cherish and acknowledge</s>  and with her hehad passed his prejudiced youth and fancied like an idiot that hehad found sympathy</s>  yes so long as he was a slave a mechanicalsubmissive slave bowing his mind to all the traditionary bigotrywhich she adored never daring to form an opinion for himselfworshipping her idol custom and labouring by habitual hypocrisy toperpetuate the delusions of all around her</s> in the meantime while lord cadurcis was chewing the cud of thesebitter feelings we will take the opportunity of explaining theimmediate cause of lady annabels frigid reception of his friendlyadvances</s>  all that she had heard of cadurcis all the information shehad within these few days so rapidly acquired of his character andconduct were indeed not calculated to dispose her to witness therenewal of their intimacy with feelings of remarkable satisfaction</s> but this morning she had read his poem the poem that all london wastalking of and she had read it with horror</s>  she looked upon cadurcisas a lost man</s>  with her indeed since her marriage an imaginativemind had become an object of terror but there were some peculiaritiesin the tone of cadurcis genius which magnified to excess her generalapprehension on this head</s>  she traced in every line the evidencesof a raging vanity which she was convinced must prompt its ownerto sacrifice on all occasions every feeling of duty to itsgratification</s>  amid all the fervour of rebellious passions and theviolence of a wayward mind a sentiment of profound egotism appearedto her impressed on every page she perused</s>  great as might have beenthe original errors of herbert awful as in her estimation were thecrimes to which they had led him they might in the first instance betraced rather to a perverted view of society than of himself</s>  but selfwas the idol of cadurcis self distorted into a phantom that seemedto lady annabel pregnant not only with terrible crimes but with thebasest and most humiliating vices</s>  the certain degradation which inthe instance of her husband had been the consequence of a bad systemwould in her opinion in the case of cadurcis be the result of abad nature and when she called to mind that there had once been aprobability that this individual might have become the husband of hervenetia her child whom it had been the sole purpose of her life tosave from the misery of which she herself had been the victim thatshe had even dwelt on the idea with complacency

exclaimed i tremblefor him when he addresses me</s>  in spite of the glittering surface onwhich he now floats i foresee only a career of violence degradationand remorse</s> he is a problem difficult to solve replied masham but there areelements not only in his character but his career so different fromthose of the person of whom we were speaking that i am not inclinedat once to admit that the result must necessarily be the same</s> i see none replied lady annabel at least none of sufficientinfluence to work any material change</s> what think you of his success</s>  replied masham</s>  cadurcis isevidently proud of it</s>  with all his affected scorn of the world heis the slave of society</s>  he may pique the feelings of mankind but idoubt whether he will outrage them</s> he is on such a dizzy eminence replied lady annabel that i do notbelieve he is capable of calculating so finely</s>  he does not believe iam sure in the possibility of resistance</s>  his vanity will tempt himonwards</s> not to persecution said masham</s>  now my opinion of cadurcis isthat his egotism or selfism or whatever you may style it willultimately preserve him from any very fatal from any irrecoverableexcesses</s>  he is of the world worldly</s>  all his works all his conducttend only to astonish mankind</s>  he is not prompted by any visionaryideas of ameliorating his species</s>  the instinct of selfpreservationwill serve him as ballast</s> we shall see said lady annabel for myself whatever may be hisend i feel assured that great and disgraceful vicissitudes are instore for him</s> it is strange after what in comparison with such extraordinarychanges must be esteemed so brief an interval observed masham witha smile to witness such a revolution in his position</s>  i

duped and that the new beauty out of hisfancy for whom she had flattered herself she had so triumphantlyrallied him was an old friend whom he always admired</s>  she seized thefirst occasion after this discovery of relieving her feelings bya scene so violent that cadurcis had never again entered monteaglehouse and then repenting of this mortifying result which she hadherself precipitated she overwhelmed him with letters which nextto scenes were the very things which lord cadurcis most heartilyabhorred</s>  these now indignant now passionate now loading him withreproaches now appealing to his love and now to his pity dailyarrived at his residence and were greeted at first only with shortand sarcastic replies and finally by silence</s>  then the lady soliciteda final interview and lord

crisis</s>  the day after thelast conversation with her which we have noticed he had indeedboldly called upon the herberts at their hotel for that purpose butwithout success as they were again absent

her daughter itwould seem that these circumstances combined to prevent lord cadurcisfrom being disappointed at least in the first object which he wishedto obtain an opportunity</s> and yet several days elapsed before this offered itself passed bycadurcis however very pleasantly in the presence of the being heloved and very judiciously too for no one could possibly be moreamiable and ingratiating than our friend</s>  every one present exceptlady annabel appeared to entertain for him as much affection asadmiration those who had only met him in throngs were quite surprisedhow their

his projects and pretensions she heartily wished himsuccess assisted him with all her efforts and desired nothing moresincerely than that her niece should achieve such a conquest and sheobtain so distinguished a nephew</s> notwithstanding her promise to her mother venetia felt justified inmaking no alteration in her conduct to one whom she still sincerelyloved and under the immediate influence

that was a conviction which by no process ofreflection however ingenious could she delude herself to credit</s> venetia struggled to take refuge in content a mood of mind perhapsless natural than it should be to one so young so gifted and sofair</s> their villa was surrounded by a garden in the ornate and artificialstyle of the country</s>  a marble terrace overlooked the lake crownedwith many a statue and vase that held the aloe</s>  the laurel and thecactus the cypress and the pine filled the air with their fragranceor charmed the eye with their rarity and beauty the walks werefestooned with the vine and they could raise their hands and pluckthe glowing fruit which screened them from the beam by which it wasripened</s>  in this enchanted domain venetia might be often seen aform even fairer than the sculptured nymphs among which she glidedcatching the gentle breeze that played upon the surface of the lakeor watching the white sail that glittered in the sun as it floatedover its purple bosom</s> yet this beautiful retreat venetia was soon to quit and she thoughtof her departure with a sigh</s>  her mother had been warned to avoidthe neighbourhood of the mountains in the winter and the autumn wasapproaching its close</s>  if venetia could endure the passage of theapennines it was the intention of lady annabel to pass the winteron the coast of the mediterranean otherwise to settle in one of thelombard cities</s>  at all events in the course of a few weeks they wereto quit their villa on the lake</s> chapter ii</s> a very few days after this excursion on the lake lady annabel and herdaughter were both surprised and pleased with a visit from a friendwhose appearance was certainly very unexpected this was captaincadurcis</s>  on his way from switzerland to sicily he had heard of theirresidence in the neighbourhood and had crossed over from arona tovisit them</s> the name of cadurcis was still dear to venetia and george haddisplayed such gallantry and devotion in all his cousins troublesthat she was personally attached to him he had always been afavourite of her mother his arrival therefore was welcomed by eachof the ladies with great cordiality</s>  he accepted the hospitality whichlady annabel offered him and remained with them a week a periodwhich they spent in visiting the most beautiful and interesting spotsof the lake with which they were already sufficiently familiar toallow them to prove guides as able as they were agreeable</s>  theseexcursions indeed contributed to the pleasure and happiness of thewhole party</s>  there was about captain cadurcis a natural cheerfulnesswhich animated every one in his society a gay simplicity difficultto define but very charming and which without effort oftenproduced deeper impressions than more brilliant and subtle qualities</s> left alone in the world and without a single advantage save thosethat nature had conferred upon him it had often been remarkedthat in whatever circle he moved george cadurcis always became thefavourite and everywhere made friends</s>  his sweet and engaging temperhad perhaps as much contributed to his professional success as hisdistinguished gallantry and skill</s>  other officers no doubt wereas brave and able as captain cadurcis but his commanders alwayssignalled him out for favourable notice and strange to say hissuccess instead of exciting envy and illwill pleased even his lessfortunate competitors</s>  however hard another might feel his own lot itwas soothed by the reflection that george cadurcis was at leastmore fortunate</s>  his popularity however was not confined to hisprofession</s>  his cousins noble guardian whom george had never seenuntil he ventured to call upon his lordship on his return to englandnow looked upon him almost as a son and omitted no opportunity ofadvancing his interests in the world</s>  of all the members of the houseof commons he was perhaps the only one that everybody praised andhis success in the world of fashion had been as remarkable as in hisprofession</s>  these great revolutions in his life and future prospectshad however not produced the slightest change in his mind andmanners and this was perhaps the secret spell of his prosperity</s> though we are most of us the creatures of affectation simplicity hasa great charm especially when attended as in the present instancewith many agreeable and some noble qualities</s>  in spite of the roughfortunes of his youth the breeding of captain cadurcis was high therecollection of the race to which he belonged had never been forgottenby him</s>  he was proud of his family</s>  he had one of those light heartstoo which enable their possessors to acquire accomplishments withfacility he had a sweet voice a quick ear a rapid eye</s>  heacquired a language as some men learn an air</s>  then his temper wasimperturbable and although the most obliging and kindestheartedcreature that ever lived there was a native dignity about him whichprevented his goodnature from being abused</s>  no sense of interesteither could ever induce him to act contrary to the dictates of hisjudgment and his heart</s>  at the risk of offending his patron georgesided with his cousin although he had deeply offended his guardianand although the whole world was against him</s>  indeed the strongaffection that lord cadurcis instantly entertained for george isnot the least remarkable instance of the singular though silentinfluence that captain cadurcis everywhere acquired</s>  lord cadurcishad fixed upon him for his friend from the first moment of theiracquaintance and though apparently there could not be two charactersmore dissimilar there were at bottom some striking points of sympathyand some strong bonds of union in the generosity and courage thatdistinguished both and in the mutual blood that filled their veins</s> there seemed to be a tacit understanding between the several membersof our party that the name of lord cadurcis was not to be mentioned</s> lady annabel made no inquiry after him venetia was unwilling tohazard a question which would annoy her mother and of which theanswer could not bring her much satisfaction and captain cadurcis didnot think fit himself to originate any conversation on the subject</s> nevertheless venetia could not help sometimes fancying when her eyesmet his that their mutual thoughts were the same and both dwellingon one who was absent and of whom her companion would willingly haveconversed</s>  to confess the truth indeed george cadurcis was on hisway to join his cousin who had crossed over from spain to barbaryand journeyed along the african coast from tangiers to tripoli</s>  theirpoint of reunion was to be sicily or malta</s>  hearing of the residenceof the herberts on the lake he thought it would be but kind toplantagenet to visit them and perhaps to bear to him some messagefrom venetia</s>  there was nothing indeed on which captain cadurciswas more intent than to effect the union between his cousin and missherbert</s>  he was deeply impressed with the sincerity of plantagenetspassion and he himself entertained for the lady the greatestaffection and admiration</s>  he thought she was the only person whom hehad ever known who was really worthy to be his cousins bride</s>  andindependent of her personal charms and undoubted talents she haddisplayed during the outcry against lord cadurcis so much good sensesuch a fine spirit and such modest yet sincere affection for thevictim that george cadurcis had almost lost his own heart to herwhen he was endeavouring to induce her not utterly to reject that ofanother and it became one of the dreams of his life that in a littletime when all as he fondly anticipated had ended as it shouldand as he wished it he should be able to find an occasional home atcadurcis abbey and enjoy the charming society of one whom he hadalready taught himself to consider as a sister</s> and tonight you must indeed go</s>  said venetia as they were walkingtogether on the terrace</s>  it was the only time that they had been alonetogether during his visit</s> i must start from arona at daybreak replied george and i musttravel quickly for in less than a month i must be in sicily</s> sicily</s>  why are you going to sicily</s> captain cadurcis smiled</s>  i am going to join a friend

i think travel has greatly benefited him</s>  he seemsquite delighted with his glimpse of oriental manners and i shouldscarcely be surprised if he were now to stretch on to constantinople</s> i wonder if he will ever return to england said venetiathoughtfully</s> there is only one event that would induce him said captaincadurcis</s>  and then after a pause he added you will not ask me whatit is</s> i wish he were in england and were happy said venetia</s> it is in your power to effect both results said her companion</s> it is useless to recur to that subject said venetia</s>  plantagenetknows my

our families</s>  i cannotpenetrate it it baffles me</s> i am sure said captain cadurcis with great animation nay i wouldpledge my existence cheerfully on the venture that if lady annabelwould only relent towards cadurcis we should all be the happiestpeople in the world</s> heigho</s>  said venetia</s>  there are other cares in our house besidesour unfortunate acquaintance with your cousin</s>  we were the last peoplein the world with whom he should ever have become connected</s> and yet it was an intimacy that commenced auspiciously said herfriend</s>  i am sure i have sat with cadurcis and

said venetia a tear stealing downher cheek</s>  but indeed we must not talk of these things</s>  as formyself i think not of happiness</s>  i am certain i am not born to behappy</s>  i wish only to

from smiling at the simplicity of thisconfession</s> well continued her companion everything after all is for thebest</s>  you and plantagenet are both very young i live in hopes that ishall yet see

painful and the natural gaiety of captaincadurcis deserted him</s>  he had become greatly attached to the herberts</s> without any female relatives of his own their former intimacy andprobable

calculated to bring out the softer tints and more subdued tonesof our character but even then the dignified grace of lady annabeland the radiant beauty of venetia had captivated him and he hadcultivated their society with assiduity and extreme pleasure</s>  thegrand crisis of his cousins fortunes had enabled him to becomeintimate with the more secret and serious qualities of venetia

themuncertain even if they should ever meet again his soft hearttrembled and he could scarcely refrain from tears as he pressed theirhands and bade them his sincere adieus</s> the moon had risen ere he entered his boat and flung a rippling lineof glittering light on the bosom of the lake</s>  the sky was without acloud save a few thin fleecy vapours that hovered over the azure browof a distant mountain</s>  the shores of the lake were suffused with theserene effulgence and every object was so distinct that the eye waspained by the lights of the villages that every instant became morenumerous and vivid</s>  the bell of a small chapel on the opposite shoreand the distant chant of some fishermen still working at their netswere the only sounds that broke the silence which they did notdisturb</s>  reclined in his boat george cadurcis watched the vanishingvilla of the herberts until the light in the principal chamber wasthe only sign that assured him of its site</s>  that chamber held venetiathe unhappy venetia</s>  he covered his face with his hand when eventhe light of her chamber vanished and full of thoughts tender anddisconsolate he at length arrived at arona</s> chapter iii</s> pursuant to their plans the herberts left the lago maggiore towardsthe end of october and proceeded by gentle journeys to the apennines</s> before they crossed this barrier they were

glad to findthat they could be sheltered in a commodious inn</s> the building had originally been a palace and in its halls andgalleries and the vast octagonal vestibule on which the principalapartments opened it retained many noble indications of the purposesto which it was formerly destined</s> at present a lazy innkeeper who did nothing his bustling wifewho seemed equally at

very pallidso colourless indeed that its aspect was almost unearthly but hislarge blue eyes that were deeply set in his majestic brow stillglittered with fire and their expression alone gave life to a

workedto such a degree upon her character that she even at times halfresolved to speak to venetia upon the subject and contrive somemethod of communicating her wishes to her father but pride

quitted that country shortly after the strugglewas over chiefly from considerations for his health</s>  his energies hadbeen fast failing him and a retired life and change of climate hadbeen

again in his native countryas a prisoner on parole</s>  it would have been quite impossible for himto mix in the civil business of his native land or enjoy any of therights of citizenship</s>  if a mild sovereign in his mercy had indeedaccorded him a pardon it must have been accompanied with rigorous andmortifying conditions and his presence in all probability wouldhave been confined to his country residence and its immediateneighbourhood</s>  the pride of lady annabel herself recoiled from thissufferance and although herbert keenly conscious of the sacrificewhich a permanent estrangement from england entailed upon his wife andchild would have submitted to any restrictions however humiliatingprovided they were not inconsistent with his honour it must beconfessed that when he spoke of this painful subject to his wifeit was with no slight selfcongratulation that he had found herresolution to remain abroad under any circumstances was fixed with herhabitual decision</s>  she communicated both to the bishop of  and toher brother the unexpected change that had occurred in her conditionand she had reason to believe that a representation of what hadhappened would be made to the royal family</s>  perhaps both the head ofher house and her reverend friend anticipated that time might removethe barrier that presented itself to herberts immediate return toengland they

consciousness that herexertions had mainly contributed to if not completely occasionedall this felicity were remedies of far more efficacy than all theconsultations and prescriptions of her physicians</s>  the conduct of herfather repaid her for all her sufferings and realised all herdreams of domestic tenderness and delight</s>  tender grateful andaffectionate herbert hovered round her mother like a delicate spiritwho had been released by some kind mortal from a tedious and revoltingthraldom and who believed he could never sufficiently testify hisdevotion</s>  there was so much respect blended with his fondness thatthe spirit of her mother was utterly subdued by his irresistibledemeanour</s>  all her sadness and reserve her distrust and her fear hadvanished and rising

artifices of affection their misery might have beenprevented</s>  once when they were alone her softened heart would haveconfessed to herbert this painful conviction but he was too happyand too generous to permit her for a moment to indulge in such aremorseful retrospect</s>  all the error he insisted was his own and hehad been fool enough to have wantonly forfeited a happiness which timeand experience had now taught him to appreciate</s> we married too young marmion said his wife</s> it shall be that then love replied herbert but for all that ihave suffered</s>  i would not have avoided my fate on the condition oflosing the exquisite present</s> it is perhaps scarcely necessary to remark that herbert avoided withthe most scrupulous vigilance the slightest allusion to any of thosepeculiar opinions for which he was unhappily too celebrated</s>  musingover the singular revolutions which had already occurred in his habitsand his feelings towards herself lady annabel indeed did notdespair that his once selfsufficient soul might ultimately bowto that blessed faith which to herself had ever proved so great asupport and so exquisite a solace</s>  it was indeed the inexpressiblehope that lingered at the bottom of her heart and sometimes she evenindulged in the delightful fancy that his mild and penitent spirithad by the gracious mercy of providence been already touched by thebright sunbeam of conviction</s>  at all events his subdued and chastenedtemperament was no unworthy preparation for still greater blessings</s> it was this hallowed anticipation which consoled and alone consoledlady annabel for her own estrangement from the communion of hernational church</s>  of all the sacrifices which her devotion to herbertentailed upon her this was the one which she felt most constantlyand most severely</s>  not a day elapsed but the chapel at cherbury rosebefore her and when she remembered that neither herself nor herdaughter might again kneel round the altar of their god she almosttrembled at the step which she had taken and almost esteemed ita sacrifice of heavenly to earthly duty which no considerationperhaps warranted</s>  this apprehension indeed was the cloud inher life and one which venetia who felt all its validity founddifficulty in combating</s> otherwise when venetia beheld her parents she felt etherealand seemed to move in air

not pour forth instantaneously a flood offine fancies and deep intelligence</s>  he seemed to have read every bookin every language and to have mused over every line he had read</s>  shecould not conceive how one the tone of whose mind was so originalthat it suggested on every topic some conclusion that struck instantlyby its racy novelty could be so saturated with the learning and theviews of other men</s>  although they lived in unbroken solitude and werealmost always together not a day passed that she did not find herselfmusing over some thought or expression of her father and which brokefrom his mind without effort and as if by chance</s>  literature toherbert was now only a source of amusement and engaging occupation</s> all thought of fame had long fled his soul</s>  he cared not for beingdisturbed and he would throw down his plato for don quixote or closehis aeschylus and take up a volume of madame de svign without amurmur if reminded by anything that occurred of a passage which mightcontribute to the amusement and instruction of his wife and daughter</s> indeed his only study now was to contribute to their happiness</s>  forhim they had given up their country and society and he sought by hisvigilant attention and his various accomplishments to render theirhours as light and pleasant as under such circumstances waspossible</s>  his muse too was only dedicated to the celebration of anytopic which their life or themselves suggested</s>  he loved to lie underthe trees and pour forth sonnets to lady annabel and encouragedvenetia by the readiness and interest with which he invariablycomplied with her intimations to throw out every fancy which occurredto her for his verse</s>  a life passed without the intrusion of a singleevil passion without a

which you were speaking itsquality and duration depend upon the degree of sympathy that subsistsbetween the two persons interested</s>  plato believed and i believe withhim in the existence of a

of the evening lady annabel requested lord cadurcis andhis cousin to take up their quarters at the villa</s>  independent of thedelight which such an invitation occasioned him cadurcis was doublygratified by its being given by her</s>  it was indeed her unpromptedsolicitation for neither herbert nor even venetia however muchthey desired the arrangement was anxious to appear eager for itsfulfilment</s>  desirous of pleasing her husband and her daughter alittle penitent as to her previous treatment of cadurcis now thattime and strange events had combined to soften her feelings and wonby his engaging demeanour towards herself lady annabel had of mereimpulse resolved upon the act and she was repaid by the general airof gaiety and content which it diffused through the circle</s> few weeks indeed passed ere her ladyship taught herself even tocontemplate the possibility of an union between her daughter andlord cadurcis</s>  the change which had occurred in her own feelings andposition had in her estimation removed very considerable barriers tosuch a result</s>  it would not become her again to urge the peculiarityof his temperament as an insuperable objection to the marriage thatwas out of the question even if the conscience of lady annabelherself now that she was so happy were perfectly free from anyparticipation in the causes which occasioned the original estrangementbetween herbert and herself</s>  desirous too as all mothers are thather daughter should be suitably married lady annabel could not shuther eyes to the great improbability of such an event occurring nowthat venetia had as it were resigned all connection with her nativecountry</s>  as to her daughter marrying a foreigner the very idea wasintolerable to her and venetia appeared therefore to have resumedthat singular and delicate position which she occupied at cherbury inearlier years when lady annabel had esteemed her connection with lordcadurcis so fortunate and auspicious</s>  moreover while lord cadurcisin birth rank country and consideration offered in every view ofthe ease so gratifying an alliance he was perhaps the only englishmanwhose marriage into her family would not deprive her of the society ofher child</s>  cadurcis had a great distaste for england which he seizedevery opportunity to express</s>  he continually declared that he wouldnever return there and his habits of seclusion and study so entirelyaccorded with those of her husband that lady annabel did not doubtthey would continue to form only one family a prospect so engaging toher that it would perhaps have alone removed the distrust which shehad so unfortunately cherished against the admirer of her daughterand although some of his reputed opinions occasioned her doubtlessconsiderable anxiety he was nevertheless very young and far fromemancipated from the beneficial influence of his early education</s>  shewas sanguine that this sheep would yet return to the fold where oncehe had been tended with so much solicitude</s>  when too she called tomind the chastened spirit of her husband and could not refrain fromfeeling that had she not quitted him he might at a much earlierperiod have attained a mood so full of promise and to her so cheeringshe could not resist the persuasion that under the influence ofvenetia cadurcis might speedily free himself from the dominion ofthat arrogant genius to which rather than to any serious convictionthe result of a studious philosophy she attributed his indifferenceon the most important of subjects</s>  on the whole however it was withno common gratification that lady annabel observed the strong andintimate friendship that arose between her husband and cadurcis</s>  theywere inseparable companions</s>  independently of the natural sympathybetween two highly imaginative minds there were in the superiorexperience the noble character the vast knowledge and refined tasteof herbert charms of which cadurcis was very susceptible cadurcis hadnot been a great reader himself and he liked the company of one whosemind was at once so richly cultured and so deeply meditative thus heobtained matter and spirit distilled through the alembic of anothersbrain</s>  jealousy had never had a place in herberts temperament now hewas insensible even to emulation</s>  he spoke of cadurcis as he thoughtwith the highest admiration as one without a rival and in whosepower it was to obtain an imperishable fame</s>  it was his liveliestpleasure to assist the full development of such an intellect and topour to him with a lavish hand all the treasures of his taste hislearning his fancy and his meditation</s>  his kind heart his winningmanners his subdued and perfect temper and the remembrance of therelation which he bore to venetia completed the spell which boundcadurcis to him with all the finest feelings of his nature</s>  it wasindeed an intercourse peculiarly beneficial to cadurcis whose careerhad hitherto tended rather to the development of the power than therefinement of his genius and to whom an active communion with anequal spirit of a more matured intelligence was an incident rather tobe desired than expected</s>  herbert and cadurcis therefore spent theirmornings together sometimes in the library sometimes wandering inthe chestnut woods sometimes sailing in the boat of the brig forthey were both fond of the sea in these excursions george was ingeneral their companion</s>  he had become a great favourite with herbertas with everybody else</s>  no one managed a boat so well althoughcadurcis prided himself also on his skill in this respect and georgewas so frank and unaffected and so used to his cousins habits thathis presence never embarrassed herbert and cadurcis and they read orconversed quite at their ease as if there were no third person tomar by his want of sympathy the full communion of their intellect</s> the whole circle met at dinner and never again parted until at a latehour of night</s>  this was a most agreeable life cadurcis himself goodhumoured because he was happy doubly exerted himself to ingratiatehimself with lady annabel and felt every day that he was advancing</s> venetia always smiled upon him and praised him delightfully for hisdelightful conduct</s> in the evening herbert would read to them the manuscript poem ofcadurcis the fruits

would sooner have known him and plato than any of the ancientssaid herbert</s>  i look upon plato as the wisest and the profoundest ofmen and upon epicurus as the most humane and gentle</s> now how do

spring to the mind</s>  of moderntimes the feudal ages of italy most interest me</s>  i think that was aspringtide of civilisation all the fine arts nourished at the samemoment</s> they ever will said herbert</s>  all the inventive arts maintain asympathetic connection between each other for after all they areonly various expressions of one internal power modified by differentcircumstances either of the individual or of society</s>  it was so inthe age of pericles i mean the interval which intervened betweenthe birth of that great man and the death of aristotle undoubtedlywhether considered in

shakspeare</s>  said cadurcis</s>  we know of him as much as wedo of homer</s>  did he write half the plays attributed to him</s>  did heever write a single whole play</s>  i doubt it</s>  he appears to me to havebeen an inspired adapter for the theatres which were then not asgood as barns</s>  i take him to have been a botcher up of old plays</s> his popularity is of modern date and it may not

forced therefore to wait at spezzia in anagony of impotent suspense until the fury of the storm was over andthe sky was partially cleared</s>  at length the objects became graduallyless obscure he

to enliven</s> he was well aware that even his eloquence and all the influence ofhis piety could not soften the irreparable past and knowing fromexperience how in solitude the unhappy brood over sorrow he fanciedthat his arrival and perhaps his arrival only might tend in somedegree at this moment to their alleviation and comfort</s>  he broughtlady annabel and venetia letters from their relations with whom hehad been staying at their country residence and who were anxious thattheir unhappy kinsfolk should find change of scene under their roof</s> they are very affectionate said lady annabel but i rather thinkthat neither venetia nor myself feel inclined to quit cherbury atpresent</s> indeed not mamma said venetia</s>  i hope we shall never leave homeagain</s> you must come and see me some day said the bishop then turning togeorge whom he was glad to find here he addressed him in a heartytone and expressed his delight at again meeting him</s> insensibly to all parties this arrival of the good masham exercised abeneficial influence on their spirits</s>  they could sympathise with hischeerfulness because they were convinced that he sympathised withtheir sorrow</s>  his interesting conversation withdrew their minds fromthe painful subject on which they were always musing</s>  it seemedprofanation to either of the three mourners when they were togetheralone to indulge in any topic but the absorbing one and their utmosteffort was to speak of the past with composure but they all feltrelieved though at first unconsciously when one whose interest intheir feelings could not be doubted gave the signal of withdrawingtheir reflections from vicissitudes which it was useless to deplore</s> even the social forms which the presence of a guest renderedindispensable and the exercise of the courtesies of hospitalitycontributed to this result</s>  they withdrew their minds from the past</s> and the worthy bishop whose tact was as eminent as his good humourand benevolence evincing as much delicacy of feeling as cheerfulnessof temper a very few days had elapsed before each of his companionswas aware that his presence had contributed to their increasedcontent</s> you have not been to the abbey yet lord cadurcis said masham tohim one day as they were sitting together after dinner the ladieshaving retired</s>  you should go</s> i have been unwilling to leave them said george and i couldscarcely expect them to accompany me</s>  it is a visit that must revivepainful recollections</s> we must not dwell on the past said masham we must think only ofthe future</s> venetia has no future i fear said lord cadurcis</s> why not</s>  said masham she is yet a girl and with a prospect of along life</s>  she must have a future and i hope and i believe it willyet be a happy one</s> alas</s>  said lord cadurcis no one can form an idea of the attachmentthat subsisted between plantagenet and venetia</s>  they were not commonfeelings or the feelings of common minds my dear lord</s> no one knew them both better than i did said masham not evenyourself they were my children</s> i feel that said george and therefore it is a pleasure to us allto see you and to speak with you</s> but we must look for consolation said masham to deplore isfruitless</s>  if we live we must struggle to live happily</s>  to tell youthe truth though their immediate return to cherbury was inevitableand their residence here for a time is scarcely to be deprecated istill hope they will not bury themselves here</s>  for my part after thenecessary interval i wish to see venetia once more in the world</s> lord cadurcis looked very mournful and shook his head</s> as for her dear mother she is habituated to sorrow anddisappointment said masham</s>  as long as venetia lives lady annabelwill be content</s>  besides deplorable as may be the past there must besolace to her in the reflection that she was reconciled to her husbandbefore his death and contributed to his happiness</s>  venetia is thestricken lamb but venetia is formed for happiness and it is in thenature of things that she will be happy</s>  we must not however yieldunnecessarily to our feelings</s>  a violent exertion would be unwise butwe should habituate ourselves gradually to the exercise of our dutiesand to our accustomed pursuits</s>  it would be well for you to go tocadurcis</s>  if i were you i would go tomorrow</s>  take advantage of mypresence and return and give a report of your visit</s>  habituatevenetia to talk of a spot with which ultimately she must renew herintimacy</s> influenced by this advice lord cadurcis rose early on the nextmorning and repaired to the seat of his fathers where hitherto hisfoot had never trod</s>  when the circle at cherbury assembled at theirbreakfast table he was missing and masham had undertaken the officeof apprising his friends of the cause of his absence</s>  he returned todinner and the conversation fell naturally upon the abbey and theimpressions he had received</s>  it was maintained at first by ladyannabel and the bishop but venetia ultimately joined in it and withcheerfulness</s>  many a trait and incident of former days was alluded tothey talked of mrs</s>  cadurcis whom george had never seen they settledthe chambers he should inhabit they mentioned the improvementswhich plantagenet had once contemplated and which george must nowaccomplish</s> you must go to london first said the bishop you have a great dealto do and you should not delay such business</s>  i think you had betterreturn with me</s>  at this time of the year you need not be long absentyou will not be detained and when you return you will find yourselfmuch more at ease for after all nothing is more harassing than thefeeling that there is business which must be attended to and whichnevertheless is neglected</s> both lady annabel and venetia enforced this advice of their friendand so it happened that ere a week had elapsed lord cadurcisaccompanying masham found himself once more in london</s> chapter iv</s> venetia was now once more alone with her mother it was as in oldtimes</s>  their life was the same as before the visit of plantagenetprevious to his going to cambridge except indeed that they had nolonger a friend at marringhurst</s>  they missed the sabbath visits ofthat good man for though his successor performed the duties of theday which had been a condition when he was presented to the livingthe friend who knew all the secrets of their hearts was absent</s> venetia continued to bear herself with great equanimity and theanxiety which she observed instantly impressed on her motherscountenance the moment she fancied there was unusual gloom on thebrow of her child impelled venetia doubly to exert herself to appearresigned</s>  and in truth when lady annabel revolved in her mind themournful past and meditated over her early and unceasing effortsto secure the happiness of her daughter and then contrasted heraspirations with the result she could not acquit herself of havingbeen too often unconsciously instrumental in forwarding a verydifferent conclusion than that for which she had laboured</s>  thisconviction preyed upon the mother and the slightest evidence ofreaction in venetias tranquilised demeanour occasioned her the utmostremorse and grief</s>  the absence of george made both lady annabel andvenetia still more finely appreciate the solace of his society</s>  leftto themselves they felt how much they had depended on his vigilantand considerate attention and how much his sweet temper and hisunfailing sympathy had contributed to their consolation</s>  he wrotehowever to venetia by every post and his letters if possibleendeared him still more to their hearts</s>  unwilling to dwell upontheir mutual sorrows yet always expressing sufficient to prove thatdistance and absence had not impaired his sympathy he contrived withinfinite delicacy even to amuse their solitude with the adventures ofhis life of bustle</s>  the arrival of the post was the incident of theday and not merely letters arrived one day brought books anothermusic continually some fresh token of his thought and affectionreached them</s>  he was however only a fortnight absent but when hereturned it was to cadurcis</s>  he called upon them the next day andindeed every morning found him at cherbury but he returned to hishome at night and so without an effort from their guest he hadbecome their neighbour</s> plantagenet had left the whole of his property to his cousin hismothers fortune which as an accessory fund was not inconsiderablebesides the estate</s>  and george intended to devote a portion of this tothe restoration of the abbey</s>  venetia was to be his counsellor in thisoperation and therefore there were ample sources of amusement for theremainder of the year</s>  on a high ridge which was one of the beaconsof the county and which moreover marked the junction of the domainsof cherbury and cadurcis it was his intention to raise a monument tothe united memories of marmion herbert and plantagenet lord cadurcis</s> he brought down a design with him from london and this was theproject which he had previously whispered to venetia</s>  with george forher companion too venetia was induced to resume her rides</s>  it washer part to make him acquainted with the county in which he was soimportant a resident</s>  time therefore at cherbury on the wholeflowed on in a tide of tranquil pleasure and lady annabel observedwith interest and fondness the continual presence beneath her roofof one who from the first day she had met him had engaged her kindfeelings and had since become intimately endeared to her</s> the end of november was however now approaching and parliamentwas about to reassemble</s>  masham had written more than once to lordcadurcis impressing upon him the propriety and expediency of takinghis seat</s>  he had shown these letters as he showed everything tovenetia who was his counsellor on all subjects and venetia agreedwith their friend</s> it is right said venetia you have a duty to perform and you mustperform it</s>  besides i do not wish the name of cadurcis to sink againinto obscurity</s>  i shall look forward with interest to lord cadurcistaking the oaths and his seat</s>  it will please me it will indeed</s> but venetia said george i do not like to leave this place</s>  i amhappy if we may be happy</s>  this life suits me</s>  i am a quiet man</s>  idislike london</s>  i feel alone there</s> you can write to us you will have a great deal to say</s>  and i shallhave something to say to you now</s>  i must give you a continual reporthow they go on at the abbey</s>  i will be your steward and superintendeverything</s> ah</s>  said george what shall i do in london without you withoutyour advice</s>  there will be something occurring every day and i shallhave no one to consult</s>  indeed i shall feel quite miserable i shallindeed</s> it is quite impossible that with your station and at your time oflife you should bury yourself in the country said venetia</s>  youhave the whole world before you and you must enjoy it</s>  it is verywell for mamma and myself to lead this life</s>  i look upon ourselves astwo nuns</s>  if cadurcis is an abbey cherbury is now a convent</s> how can a man wish to be more than happy</s>  i am quite content heresaid george what is london to me</s> it may be a great deal to you more than you think said venetia</s>  agreat deal awaits you yet</s>  however there can be no doubt you shouldtake your seat</s>  you can always return if you wish</s>  but take yourseat and cultivate dear masham</s>  i have the utmost confidence in hiswisdom and goodness</s>  you cannot have a friend more respectable</s>  nowmind my advice george</s> i always do venetia</s> chapter v</s> time and faith are the great consolers and neither of these precioussources of solace were wanting to the inhabitants of cherbury</s>  theywere again living alone but their lives were cheerful and if venetiano longer indulged in a worldly and blissful future nevertheless inthe society of her mother in the resources of art and literature inthe diligent discharge of her duties to her humble neighbours and incherishing the memory of the departed she experienced a life that wasnot without its tranquil pleasures</s>  she maintained with lord cadurcisa constant correspondence he wrote to her every day and althoughthey were separated there was not an incident of his life andscarcely a thought of which she was not cognisant</s>  it was with greatdifficulty that george could induce himself to remain in london butmasham who soon obtained over him all the influence which venetiadesired ever opposed his return to the abbey</s>  the good bishop was notunaware of the feelings with which lord cadurcis looked back to thehall of cherbury and himself of a glad and sanguine temperament heindulged in a belief in the consummation of all that happiness forwhich his young friend rather sceptically sighed</s>  but masham wasaware that time could alone soften the bitterness of venetias sorrowand prepare her for that change of life which he felt confidentwould alone ensure the happiness both of herself and her mother</s>  hetherefore detained lord cadurcis in london the whole of the sessionsthat on his return to cherbury his society might be esteemed a noveland agreeable incident in the existence of its inhabitants and not beassociated merely with their calamities</s> it was therefore about a year after the catastrophe which had sosuddenly changed the whole tenor of their lives and occasioned sounexpected a revolution in his own position that lord cadurcisarrived at his ancestral seat with no intention of again speedilyleaving it</s>  he had long and frequently apprised his friends of hisapproaching presence and arriving at the abbey late at night he wasat cherbury early on the following morning</s> although no inconsiderable interval had elapsed since lord cadurcishad parted from the herberts the continual correspondence that hadbeen maintained between himself and venetia divested his visit of theslightest embarrassment</s>  they met as if they had parted yesterdayexcept perhaps with greater fondness</s>  the chain of their feelingswas unbroken</s>  he was indeed welcomed both by lady annabel and herdaughter with warm affection and his absence had only rendered himdearer to them by affording an opportunity of feeling how much hissociety contributed to their felicity</s>  venetia was anxious to know hisopinion of the improvements at the abbey which she had superintendedbut he assured her that he would examine nothing without her companyand ultimately they agreed to walk over to cadurcis</s> it was a summer day and they walked through that very wood whereinwe described the journey of the child venetia at the commencementof this very history</s>  the blue patches of wild hyacinths had alldisappeared but there were flowers as sweet</s>  what if the firstfeelings of our heart fade like the first flowers of springsucceeding years like the coming summer may bring emotions not lesscharming and perchance far more fervent</s> i can scarcely believe said lord cadurcis that i am once morewith you</s>  i know not what surprises me most venetia that we shouldbe walking once more together in the woods of cherbury or that i evershould have dared to quit them</s> and yet it was better dear george said venetia</s>  you must nowrejoice that you have fulfilled your duty and yet you are here again</s> besides the abbey never would have been finished if you had remained</s> to complete all our plans it required a mistress</s> i wish it always had one said george</s>  ah venetia</s>  once you toldme never to despair</s> and what have you to despair about george</s> heigh ho</s>  said lord cadurcis i never shall be able to live in thisabbey alone</s> you should have brought a wife from london said venetia</s> i told you once venetia that i was not a marrying man said lordcadurcis and certainly i never shall bring a wife from london</s> then you cannot accustom yourself too soon to a bachelors lifesaid venetia</s> ah venetia</s>  said george i wish i were clever i wish i were agenius i wish i were a great man</s> why george</s> because venetia perhaps and lord cadurcis hesitated perhaps youwould think differently of me</s>  i mean perhaps your feelings towards memight ah venetia</s>  perhaps you might think me worthy of you perhapsyou might love me</s> i am sure dear george if i did not love you i should be the mostungrateful of beings you are our only friend</s> and can i never be more than a friend to you venetia</s>  said lordcadurcis blushing very deeply</s> i am sure dear george i should be very sorry for your sake if youwished to be more said venetia</s> why</s>  said
