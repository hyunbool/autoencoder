back library orbookcloset au troisime no</s>  33 rue dunt faubourg st</s>  germain</s>  forone hour at least we had maintained a profound silence while each toany casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupiedwith the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of thechamber</s>  for myself however i was mentally discussing certain topicswhich had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier periodof the evening i mean the affair of the rue morgue and the mysteryattending the murder of marie rogt</s>  i looked upon it therefore assomething of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrownopen and admitted our old acquaintance monsieur g the prefect of theparisian police</s> we gave him a hearty welcome for there was nearly half as much of theentertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seenhim for several years</s>  we had been sitting in the dark and dupin nowarose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again withoutdoing so upon g</s> s saying that he had called to consult us or ratherto ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which hadoccasioned a great deal of trouble</s> if it is any point requiring reflection observed dupin as heforebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose inthe dark</s> that is another of your odd notions said the prefect who had afashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehensionand thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities</s> very true said dupin as he supplied his visiter with a pipe androlled towards him a comfortable chair</s> and what is the difficulty now</s>  i asked</s>  nothing more in theassassination way i hope</s> oh no nothing of that nature</s>  the fact is the business is very simpleindeed and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently wellourselves but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details ofit because it is so excessively odd</s> simple and odd said dupin</s> why yes and not exactly that either</s>  the fact is we have all beena good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles usaltogether</s> perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you atfault said my friend</s> what nonsense you do talk</s>  replied the prefect laughing heartily</s> perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said dupin</s> oh good heavens</s>  who ever heard of such an idea</s> a little too selfevident</s> ha</s>  ha</s>  haha</s>  ha</s>  ha</s> ho</s>  ho</s>  ho</s>  roared our visiter profoundlyamused oh dupin you will be the death of me yet</s> and what after all is the matter on hand</s>  i asked</s> why i will tell you replied the prefect as he gave a long steadyand contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair</s>  i will tellyou in a few words but before i begin let me caution you that thisis an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that i should mostprobably lose the position i now hold were it known that i confided itto any one</s> proceed said i</s> or not said dupin</s> well then i have received personal information from a very highquarter that a certain document of the last importance has beenpurloined from the royal apartments</s>  the individual who purloined it isknown this beyond a doubt he was seen to take it</s>  it is known alsothat it still remains in his possession</s> how is this known</s>  asked dupin</s> it is clearly inferred replied the prefect from the nature of thedocument and from the nonappearance of certain results which would atonce arise from its passing out of the robbers possession that is tosay from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it</s> be a little more explicit i said</s> well i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holdera certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immenselyvaluable</s>  the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy</s> still i do not quite understand said dupin</s> no</s>  well the disclosure of the document to a third person who shallbe nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of mostexalted station and this fact gives the holder of the document anascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are sojeopardized</s> but this ascendancy i interposed would depend upon the robbersknowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber</s>  who would darethe thief said g</s>  is the minister d who dares all things thoseunbecoming as well as those becoming a man</s>  the method of the theft wasnot less ingenious than bold</s>  the document in questiona letter tobe frankhad been received by the personage robbed while alone in theroyal boudoir</s>  during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by theentrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was herwish to conceal it</s>  after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it ina drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table</s>  theaddress however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed theletter escaped notice</s>  at this juncture enters the minister d</s>  hislynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwritingof the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed andfathoms her secret</s>  after some business transactions hurried through inhis ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the onein question opens it pretends to read it and then places it inclose juxtaposition to the other</s>  again he converses for some fifteenminutes upon the public affairs</s>  at length in taking leave he takesalso from the table the letter to which he had no claim</s>  its rightfulowner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in thepresence of the third personage who stood at her elbow</s>  the ministerdecamped leaving his own letterone of no importanceupon the table</s> here then said dupin to me you have precisely what you demandto make the ascendancy completethe robbers knowledge of the losersknowledge of the robber</s> yes replied the prefect and the power thus attained has for somemonths past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerousextent</s>  the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day ofthe necessity of reclaiming her letter</s>  but this of course cannot bedone openly</s>  in fine driven to despair she has committed the matter tome</s> than whom said dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no moresagacious agent could i suppose be desired or even imagined</s> you flatter me replied the prefect but it is possible that somesuch opinion may have been entertained</s> it is clear said i as you observe that the letter is still inpossession of the minister since it is this possession and not anyemployment of the letter which bestows the power</s>  with the employmentthe power departs</s> true said g</s>  and upon this conviction i proceeded</s>  my first carewas to make thorough search of the ministers hotel and here my chiefembarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge</s> beyond all things i have been warned of the danger which would resultfrom giving him reason to suspect our design</s> but said i you are quite au fait in these investigations</s>  theparisian police have done this thing often before</s> o yes and for this reason i did not despair</s>  the habits of theminister gave me too a great advantage</s>  he is frequently absent fromhome all night</s>  his servants are by no means numerous</s>  they sleep at adistance from their masters apartment and being chiefly neapolitansare readily made drunk</s>  i have keys as you know with which i canopen any chamber or cabinet in paris</s>  for three months a night hasnot passed during the greater part of which i have not been engagedpersonally in ransacking the d hotel</s>  my honor is interested and tomention a great secret the reward is enormous</s>  so i did not abandonthe search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a moreastute man than myself</s>  i fancy that i have investigated every nook andcorner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can beconcealed</s> but is it not possible i suggested that although the letter maybe in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may haveconcealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises</s> this is barely possible said dupin</s>  the present peculiar conditionof affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which dis known to be involved would render the instant availability of thedocumentits susceptibility of being produced at a moments noticeapoint of nearly equal importance with its possession</s> its susceptibility of being produced</s>  said i</s> that is to say of being destroyed said dupin</s> true i observed the paper is clearly then upon the premises</s>  as forits being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as outof the question</s> entirely said the prefect</s>  he has been twice waylaid as if byfootpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection</s> you might have spared yourself this trouble said dupin</s>  d ipresume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipatedthese waylayings as a matter of course</s> not altogether a fool said g</s>  but then hes a poet which i take tobe only one remove from a fool</s> true said dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff fromhis meerschaum although i have been guilty of certain doggrel myself</s> suppose you detail said i the particulars of your search</s> why the fact is we took our time and we searched every where</s>  i havehad long experience in these affairs</s>  i took the entire building roomby room devoting the nights of a whole week to each</s>  we examinedfirst the furniture of each apartment</s>  we opened every possible drawerand i presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such athing as a secret drawer is impossible</s>  any man is a dolt who permits asecret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind</s>  the thing is soplain</s>  there is a certain amount of bulkof spaceto be accounted forin every cabinet</s>  then we have accurate rules</s>  the fiftieth part of aline could not escape us</s>  after the cabinets we took the chairs</s>  thecushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ</s> from the tables we removed the tops</s> why so</s> sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece offurniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article thenthe leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and thetop replaced</s>  the bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the sameway</s> but could not the cavity be detected by sounding</s>  i asked</s> by no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient waddingof cotton be placed around it</s>  besides in our case we were obliged toproceed without noise</s> but you could not have removedyou could not have taken to pieces allarticles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make adeposit in the manner you mention</s>  a letter may be compressed intoa thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a largeknittingneedle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung ofa chair for example</s>  you did not take to pieces all the chairs</s> certainly not but we did betterwe examined the rungs of everychair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description offurniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope</s>  had there beenany traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect itinstantly</s>  a single grain of gimletdust for example would have beenas obvious as an apple</s>  any disorder in the glueingany unusual gapingin the jointswould have sufficed to insure detection</s> i presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the platesand you probed the beds and the bedclothes as well as the curtains andcarpets</s> that of course and when we had absolutely completed every particle ofthe furniture in this way then we examined the house itself</s>  we dividedits entire surface into compartments which we numbered so thatnone might be missed then we scrutinized each individual square inchthroughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoiningwith the microscope as before</s> the two houses adjoining</s>  i exclaimed you must have had a great dealof trouble</s> we had but the reward offered is prodigious</s> you include the grounds about the houses</s> all the grounds are paved with brick</s>  they gave us comparativelylittle trouble</s>  we examined the moss between the bricks and found itundisturbed</s> you looked among ds papers of course and into the books of thelibrary</s> certainly we opened every package and parcel we not only openedevery book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contentingourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of ourpolice officers</s>  we also measured the thickness of every bookcoverwith the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the mostjealous scrutiny of the microscope</s>  had any of the bindings beenrecently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that thefact should have escaped observation</s>  some five or six volumes justfrom the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally withthe needles</s> you explored the floors beneath the carpets</s> beyond doubt</s>  we removed every carpet and examined the boards with themicroscope</s> and the paper on the walls</s> yes</s> you looked into the cellars</s> we did</s> then i said you have been making a miscalculation and the letteris not upon the premises as you suppose</s> i fear you are right there said the prefect</s>  and now dupin whatwould you advise me to do</s> to make a thorough research of the premises</s> that is absolutely needless replied g</s>  i am not more sure that ibreathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel</s> i have no better advice to give you said dupin</s>  you have of coursean accurate description of the letter</s> oh yes</s> and here the prefect producing a memorandumbook proceededto read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of theexternal appearance of the missing document</s>  soon after finishingthe perusal of this description he took his departure more entirelydepressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before</s>  inabout a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupiedvery nearly as before</s>  he took a pipe and a chair and entered into someordinary conversation</s>  at length i saidwell but g what of the purloined letter</s>  i presume you have atlast made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching theminister</s> confound him say iyes i made the reexamination however as dupinsuggestedbut it was all labor lost as i knew it would be</s> how much was the reward offered did you say</s>  asked dupin</s> why a very great deala very liberal rewardi dont like to say howmuch precisely but one thing i will say that i wouldnt mind givingmy individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who couldobtain me that letter</s>  the fact is it is becoming of more and moreimportance every day and the reward has been lately doubled</s>  if it weretrebled however i could do no more than i have done</s> why yes said dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of hismeerschaum i reallythink g you have not exerted yourselfto theutmost in this matter</s>  you mightdo a little more i think eh</s> how</s> in what way</s> whypuff puffyou mightpuff puffemploy counsel in thematter eh</s> puff puff puff</s>  do you remember the story they tell ofabernethy</s> no hang abernethy</s> to be sure</s>  hang him and welcome</s>  but once upon a time a certain richmiser conceived the design of spunging upon this abernethy for a medicalopinion</s>  getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in aprivate company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of animaginary individual</s> we will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such andsuch now doctor what would you have directed him to take</s> take</s>  said abernethy why take advice to be sure</s> but said the prefect a little discomposed i am perfectly willingto take advice and to pay for it</s>  i would really give fifty thousandfrancs to any one who would aid me in the matter</s> in that case replied dupin opening a drawer and producinga checkbook you may as well fill me up a check for the amountmentioned</s>  when you have signed it i will hand you the letter</s> i was astounded</s>  the prefect appeared absolutely thunderstricken</s> for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless lookingincredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemedstarting from their sockets then apparently recovering himself in somemeasure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant staresfinally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs andhanded it across the table to dupin</s>  the latter examined it carefullyand deposited it in his pocketbook then unlocking an escritoire tookthence a letter and gave it to the prefect</s>  this functionary grasped itin a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling hand cast a rapidglance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to thedoor rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the housewithout having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fillup the check</s> when he had gone my friend entered into some explanations</s> the parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way</s> they are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in theknowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand</s>  thus when gdetailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel di felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactoryinvestigationso far as his labors extended</s> so far as his labors extended</s>  said i</s> yes said dupin</s>  the measures adopted were not only the best oftheir kind but carried out to absolute perfection</s>  had the letter beendeposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyonda question have found it</s> i merely laughedbut he seemed quite serious in all that he said</s> the measures then he continued were good in their kind and wellexecuted their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case andto the man</s>  a certain set of highly ingenious resources are with theprefect a sort of procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts hisdesigns</s>  but he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow forthe matter in hand and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he</s>  iknew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the gameof even and odd attracted universal admiration</s>  this game is simpleand is played with marbles</s>  one player holds in his hand a number ofthese toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd</s> if the guess is right the guesser wins one if wrong he loses one</s>  theboy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school</s>  of course hehad some principle of guessing and this lay in mere observation andadmeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents</s>  for example an arrantsimpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks arethey even or odd</s>  our schoolboy replies odd and loses but upon thesecond trial he wins for he then says to himself the simpletonhad them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is justsufficient to make him have them odd upon the second i will thereforeguess oddhe guesses odd and wins</s>  now with a simpleton a degreeabove the first he would have reasoned thus this fellow finds that inthe first instance i guessed odd and in the second he will propose tohimself upon the first impulse a simple variation from even to oddas did the first simpleton but then a second thought will suggest thatthis is too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon puttingit even as before</s>  i will therefore guess evenhe guesses even andwins</s>  now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellowstermed luckywhat in its last analysis is it</s> it is merely i said an identification of the reasoners intellectwith that of his opponent</s> it is said dupin and upon inquiring of the boy by what means heeffected the thorough identification in which his success consisted ireceived answer as follows when i wish to find out how wise or howstupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his thoughtsat the moment i fashion the expression of my face as accurately aspossible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to seewhat thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match orcorrespond with the expression</s>  this response of the schoolboy lies atthe bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed torochefoucault to la bougive to machiavelli and to campanella</s> and the identification i said of the reasoners intellect with thatof his opponent depends if i understand you aright upon the accuracywith which the opponents intellect is admeasured</s> for its practical value it depends upon this replied dupin and theprefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of thisidentification and secondly by illadmeasurement or rather throughnonadmeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged</s>  theyconsider only their own ideas of ingenuity and in searching foranything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would havehidden it</s>  they are right in this muchthat their own ingenuity is afaithful representative of that of the mass but when the cunning of theindividual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foilsthem of course</s>  this always happens when it is above their own andvery usually when it is below</s>  they have no variation of principle intheir investigations at best when urged by some unusual emergencybysome extraordinary rewardthey extend or exaggerate their old modes ofpractice without touching their principles</s>  what for example in thiscase of d has been done to vary the principle of action</s>  what isall this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with themicroscope and dividing the surface of the building into registeredsquare incheswhat is it all but an exaggeration of the application ofthe one principle or set of principles of search which are based uponthe one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the prefectin the long routine of his duty has been accustomed</s>  do you not see hehas taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letternotexactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chairlegbut at least in someoutoftheway hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thoughtwhich would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlethole bored ina chairleg</s>  and do you not see also that such recherchs nooks forconcealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would beadopted only by ordinary intellects for in all cases of concealmenta disposal of the article concealeda disposal of it in this recherchmanneris in the very first instance presumable and presumed andthus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogetherupon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers andwhere the case is of importanceor what amounts to the same thing inthe policial eyes when the reward is of magnitudethe qualities inquestion have never been known to fail</s>  you will now understand what imeant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden any wherewithin the limits of the prefects examinationin other words had theprinciple of its concealment been comprehended within the principles ofthe prefectits discovery would have been a matter altogether beyondquestion</s>  this functionary however has been thoroughly mystifiedand the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that theminister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet</s>  all foolsare poets this the prefect feels and he is merely guilty of a nondistributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools</s> but is this really the poet</s>  i asked</s>  there are two brothers i knowand both have attained reputation in letters</s>  the minister i believe haswritten learnedly on the differential calculus</s>  he is a mathematicianand no poet</s> you are mistaken i know him well he is both</s>  as poet andmathematician he would reason well as mere mathematician he couldnot have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of theprefect</s> you surprise me i said by these opinions which have beencontradicted by the voice of the world</s>  you do not mean to set at naughtthe welldigested idea of centuries</s>
 the mathematical reason has longbeen regarded as the reason par excellence</s> il y a  parir replied dupin quoting from chamfort que touteide publique toute convention reue est une sottise car elle aconvenue au plus grand nombre</s>
 the mathematicians i grant you havedone their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude andwhich is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth</s>  with anart worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the termanalysis into application to algebra</s>  the french are the originatorsof this particular deception but if a term is of any importanceifwords derive any value from applicabilitythen analysis conveysalgebra about as much as in latin ambitus implies ambitionreligio religion or homines honesti a set of honorablemen</s> you have a quarrel on hand i see said i with some of thealgebraists of paris but proceed</s> i dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason whichis cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical</s> i dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study</s>  themathematics are the science of form and quantity mathematical reasoningis merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity</s>  the greaterror lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called purealgebra are abstract or general truths</s>  and this error is so egregiousthat i am confounded at the universality with which it has beenreceived</s>  mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth</s>  what istrue of relationof form and quantityis often grossly false in regardto morals for example</s>  in this latter science it is very usually untruethat the aggregated parts are equal to the whole</s>  in chemistry also theaxiom fails</s>  in the consideration of motive it fails for two motiveseach of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equalto the sum of their values apart</s>  there are numerous other mathematicaltruths which are only truths within the limits of relation</s>  but themathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as ifthey were of an absolutely general applicabilityas the world indeedimagines them to be</s>  bryant in his very learned mythology mentionsan analogous source of error when he says that although the paganfables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and makeinferences from them as existing realities</s>  with the algebraistshowever who are pagans themselves the pagan fables are believed andthe inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory asthrough an unaccountable addling of the brains</s>
 in short i never yetencountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equalroots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faiththat x2px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q</s>  say to one ofthese gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believeoccasions may occur where x2px is not altogether equal to q andhaving made him understand what you mean get out of his reach asspeedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock youdown</s> i mean to say continued dupin while i merely laughed at hislast observations that if the minister had been no more than amathematician the prefect would have been under no necessity of givingme this check</s>  i know him however as both mathematician and poetand my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to thecircumstances by which he was surrounded</s>  i knew him as a courtier tooand as a bold intriguant</s>  such a man i considered could not fail to beaware of the ordinary policial modes of action</s>  he could not havefailed to anticipateand events have proved that he did not fail toanticipatethe waylayings to which he was subjected</s>  he must haveforeseen i reflected the secret investigations of his premises</s>  hisfrequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the prefectas certain aids to his success i regarded only as ruses to affordopportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner toimpress them with the conviction to which g in fact did finallyarrivethe conviction that the letter was not upon the premises</s>  ifelt also that the whole train of thought which i was at some painsin detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle ofpolicial action in searches for articles concealedi felt that thiswhole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of theminister</s>  it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinarynooks of concealment</s>  he could not i reflected be so weak as not tosee that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would beas open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to thegimlets and to the microscopes of the prefect</s>  i saw in fine thathe would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if notdeliberately induced to it as a matter of choice</s>  you will rememberperhaps how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested upon ourfirst interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him somuch on account of its being so very selfevident</s> yes said i i remember his merriment well</s>  i really thought he wouldhave fallen into convulsions</s> the material world continued dupin abounds with very strictanalogies to the immaterial and thus some color of truth has beengiven to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be madeto strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description</s>  theprinciple of the vis inerti for example seems to be identical inphysics and metaphysics</s>  it is not more true in the former that a largebody is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and thatits subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than itis in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while moreforcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than thoseof inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassedand full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress</s>  againhave you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shopdoorsare the most attractive of attention</s> i have never given the matter a thought i said</s> there is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a map</s> one party playing requires another to find a given wordthe name oftown river state or empireany word in short upon the motley andperplexed surface of the chart</s>  a novice in the game generally seeks toembarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered namesbut the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters fromone end of the chart to the other</s>  these like the overlargely letteredsigns and placards of the street escape observation by dint of beingexcessively obvious and here the physical oversight is preciselyanalogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffersto pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and toopalpably selfevident</s>  but this is a point it appears somewhat aboveor beneath the understanding of the prefect</s>  he never once thoughtit probable or possible that the minister had deposited the letterimmediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of bestpreventing any portion of that world from perceiving it</s> but the more i reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminatingingenuity of d upon the fact that the document must always have beenat hand if he intended to use it to good purpose and upon the decisiveevidence obtained by the prefect that it was not hidden within thelimits of that dignitarys ordinary searchthe more satisfied ibecame that to conceal this letter the minister had resorted to thecomprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it atall</s> full of these ideas i prepared myself with a pair of green spectaclesand called one fine morning quite by accident at the ministerialhotel</s>  i found d at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usualand pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui</s>  he is perhapsthe most really energetic human being now alivebut that is only whennobody sees him</s> to be even with him i complained of my weak eyes and lamented thenecessity of the spectacles under cover of which i cautiously andthoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent onlyupon the conversation of my host</s> i paid especial attention to a large writingtable near which he satand upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and otherpapers with one or two musical instruments and a few books</s>  herehowever after a long and very deliberate scrutiny i saw nothing toexcite particular suspicion</s> at length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon atrumpery fillagree cardrack of pasteboard that hung dangling by adirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle ofthe mantelpiece</s>  in this rack which had three or four compartmentswere five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter</s>  this lastwas much soiled and crumpled</s>  it was torn nearly in two across themiddleas if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely upas worthless had been altered or stayed in the second</s>  it had alarge black seal bearing the d cipher very conspicuously and wasaddressed in a diminutive female hand to d the minister himself</s> it was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously intoone of the uppermost divisions of the rack</s> no sooner had i glanced at this letter than i concluded it to bethat of which i was in search</s>  to be sure it was to all appearanceradically different from the one of which the prefect had read us sominute a description</s>  here the seal was large and black with the dcipher there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the sfamily</s>  here the address to the minister diminutive and femininethere the superscription to a certain royal personage was markedlybold and decided the size alone formed a point of correspondence</s>  butthen the radicalness of these differences which was excessive thedirt the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent withthe true methodical habits of d and so suggestive of a design todelude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the documentthese things together with the hyperobtrusive situation of thisdocument full in the view of every visiter and thus exactly inaccordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived thesethings i say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who camewith the intention to suspect</s> i protracted my visit as long as possible and while i maintained amost animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knewwell had never failed to interest and excite him i kept my attentionreally riveted upon the letter</s>  in this examination i committed tomemory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack and alsofell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivialdoubt i might have entertained</s>  in scrutinizing the edges of the paperi observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary</s>  they presentedthe broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper havingbeen once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a reverseddirection in the same creases or edges which had formed the originalfold</s>  this discovery was sufficient</s>  it was clear to me that the letterhad been turned as a glove inside out redirected and resealed</s>  ibade the minister good morning and took my departure at once leaving agold snuffbox upon the table</s> the next morning i called for the snuffbox when we resumed quiteeagerly the conversation of the preceding day</s>  while thus engagedhowever a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately beneaththe windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of fearfulscreams and the shoutings of a terrified mob</s>  d rushed to a casementthrew it open and looked out</s>  in the meantime i stepped to thecardrack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it bya facsimile so far as regards externals which i had carefullyprepared at my lodgingsimitating the d cipher very readily bymeans of a seal formed of bread</s> the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the franticbehavior of a man with a

than fiction</s>      old saying</s> having had occasion lately in the course of some orientalinvestigations to consult the tellmenow isitsoornot a work which likethe zohar of simeon jochaides is scarcely known at all even in europeand which has never been quoted to my knowledge by any americanifwe except perhaps the author of the curiosities of americanliteraturehaving had occasion i say to turn over some pages of thefirstmentioned very remarkable work i was not a little astonished todiscover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in errorrespecting the fate of the viziers daughter scheherazade as thatfate is depicted in the arabian nights and that the denouement theregiven if not altogether inaccurate as far as it goes is at least toblame in not having gone very much farther</s> for full information on this interesting topic i must refer theinquisitive reader to the isitsoornot itself but in the meantime ishall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered</s> it will be remembered that in the usual version of the tales acertain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his queen not onlyputs her to death but makes a vow by his beard and the prophet toespouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions and thenext morning to deliver her up to the executioner</s> having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter and with areligious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon himas a man of devout feeling and excellent sense he was interrupted oneafternoon no doubt at his prayers by a visit from his grand vizier towhose daughter it appears there had occurred an idea</s> her name was scheherazade and her idea was that she would eitherredeem the land from the depopulating tax upon its beauty or perishafter the approved fashion of all heroines in the attempt</s> accordingly and although we do not find it to be leapyear whichmakes the sacrifice more meritorious she deputes her father the grandvizier to make an offer to the king of her hand</s>  this hand the kingeagerly acceptshe had intended to take it at all events and had putoff the matter from day to day only through fear of the vizierbutin accepting it now he gives all parties very distinctly to understandthat grand vizier or no grand vizier he has not the slightest designof giving up one iota of his vow or of his privileges</s>  when thereforethe fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king and did actuallymarry him despite her fathers excellent advice not to do any thing ofthe kindwhen she would and did marry him i say will i nill i itwas with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature ofthe case would allow</s> it seems however that this politic damsel who had been readingmachiavelli beyond doubt had a very ingenious little plot in hermind</s>  on the night of the wedding she contrived upon i forget whatspecious pretence to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently nearthat of the royal pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bedand a little before cockcrowing she took care to awaken the goodmonarch her husband who bore her none the worse will because heintended to wring her neck on the morrowshe managed to awaken him isay although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestionhe slept well by the profound interest of a story about a rat and ablack cat i think which she was narrating all in an undertone ofcourse to her sister</s>  when the day broke it so happened that thishistory was not altogether finished and that scheherazade in thenature of things could not finish it just then since it was high timefor her to get up and be bowstrunga thing very little more pleasantthan hanging only a trifle more genteel</s> the kings curiosity however prevailing i am sorry to say even overhis sound religious principles induced him for this once to postponethe fulfilment of his vow until next morning for the purpose and withthe hope of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the blackcat a black cat i think it was and the rat</s> the night having arrived however the lady scheherazade not only putthe finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat the rat was bluebut before she well knew what she was about found herself deep in theintricacies of a narration having reference if i am not altogethermistaken to a pink horse with green wings that went in a violentmanner by clockwork and was wound up with an indigo key</s>  with thishistory the king was even more profoundly interested than with theotherand as the day broke before its conclusion notwithstandingall the queens endeavors to get through with it in time for thebowstringing there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremonyas before for twentyfour hours</s>  the next night there happened asimilar accident with a similar result and then the nextand thenagain the next so that in the end the good monarch having beenunavoidably deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during aperiod of no less than one thousand and one nights either forgets italtogether by the expiration of this time or gets himself absolved ofit in the regular way or what is more probable breaks it outright aswell as the head of his father confessor</s>  at all events scheherazadewho being lineally descended from eve fell heir perhaps to the wholeseven baskets of talk which the latter lady we all know picked upfrom under the trees in the garden of edenscheherazade i say finallytriumphed and the tariff upon beauty was repealed</s> now this conclusion which is that of the story as we have it uponrecord is no doubt excessively proper and pleasantbut alas</s>  likea great many pleasant things is more pleasant than true and i amindebted altogether to the isitsoornot for the means of correcting theerror</s>  le mieux says a french proverb est lennemi du bien andin mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talki should have added that she put them out at compound interest untilthey amounted to seventyseven</s> my dear sister said she on the thousandandsecond night i quotethe language of the isitsoornot at this point verbatim my dearsister said she now that all this little difficulty about thebowstring has blown over and that this odious tax is so happilyrepealed i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion inwithholding from you and the king who i am sorry to say snoresathing no gentleman would do the full conclusion of sinbad the sailor</s> this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventuresthan those which i related but the truth is i felt sleepy on theparticular night of their narration and so was seduced into cuttingthem shorta grievous piece of misconduct for which i only trust thatallah will forgive me</s>  but even yet it is not too late to remedy mygreat neglectand as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two inorder to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noisei will forthwith entertain you and him if he pleases with the sequelof this very remarkable story</s> hereupon the sister of scheherazade as i have it from theisitsoornot expressed no very particular intensity of gratificationbut the king having been sufficiently pinched at length ceasedsnoring and finally said hum</s>  and then hoo</s>  when the queenunderstanding these words which are no doubt arabic to signify thathe was all attention and would do his best not to snore any morethequeen i say having arranged these matters to her satisfactionreentered thus at once into the history of sinbad the sailorat length in my old age these are the words of sinbad himself asretailed by scheherazadeat length in my old age and after enjoyingmany years of tranquillity at home i became once more possessed of adesire of visiting foreign countries and one day without acquaintingany of my family with my design i packed up some bundles of suchmerchandise as was most precious and least bulky and engaged a porterto carry them went with him down to the seashore to await the arrivalof any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into someregion which i had not as yet explored</s> having deposited the packages upon the sands we sat down beneath sometrees and looked out into the ocean in the hope of perceiving a shipbut during several hours we saw none whatever</s>  at length i fancied thati could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound and the porter afterlistening awhile declared that he also could distinguish it</s>  presentlyit grew louder and then still louder so that we could have no doubtthat the object which caused it was approaching us</s>  at length onthe edge of the horizon we discovered a black speck which rapidlyincreased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster swimmingwith a great part of its body above the surface of the sea</s>  it cametoward us with inconceivable swiftness throwing up huge waves of foamaround its breast and illuminating all that part of the sea throughwhich it passed with a long line of fire that extended far off into thedistance</s> as the thing drew near we saw it very distinctly</s>  its length was equalto that of three of the loftiest trees that grow and it was as wide asthe great hall of audience in your palace o most sublime and munificentof the caliphs</s>  its body which was unlike that of ordinary fishes wasas solid as a rock and of a jetty blackness throughout all that portionof it which floated above the water with the exception of a narrowbloodred streak that completely begirdled it</s>  the belly which floatedbeneath the surface and of which we could get only a glimpse now andthen as the monster rose and fell with the billows was entirely coveredwith metallic scales of a color like that of the moon in misty weather</s> the back was flat and nearly white and from it there extended upwardsof six spines about half the length of the whole body</s> the horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive but as ifto make up for this deficiency it was provided with at least fourscore of eyes that protruded from their sockets like those of the greendragonfly and were arranged all around the body in two rows one abovethe other and parallel to the bloodred streak which seemed to answerthe purpose of an eyebrow</s>  two or three of these dreadful eyes were muchlarger than the others and had the appearance of solid gold</s> although this beast approached us as i have before said with thegreatest rapidity it must have been moved altogether by necromancyforit had neither fins like a fish nor webfeet like a duck nor wings likethe seashell which is blown along in the manner of a vessel nor yetdid it writhe itself forward as do the eels</s>  its head and its tail wereshaped precisely alike only not far from the latter were two smallholes that served for nostrils and through which the monster puffedout its thick breath with prodigious violence and with a shriekingdisagreeable noise</s> our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great but it waseven surpassed by our astonishment when upon getting a nearer look weperceived upon the creatures back a vast number of animals about thesize and shape of men and altogether much resembling them except thatthey wore no garments as men do being supplied by nature no doubtwith an ugly uncomfortable covering a good deal like cloth but fittingso tight to the skin as to render the poor wretches laughably awkwardand put them apparently to severe pain</s>  on the very tips of their headswere certain squarelooking boxes which at first sight i thoughtmight have been intended to answer as turbans but i soon discoveredthat they were excessively heavy and solid and i therefore concludedthey were contrivances designed by their great weight to keep theheads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders</s>  aroundthe necks of the creatures were fastened black collars badges ofservitude no doubt such as we keep on our dogs only much widerand infinitely stiffer so that it was quite impossible for these poorvictims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body atthe same time and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation oftheir nosesa view puggish and snubby in a wonderful if not positivelyin an awful degree</s> when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood itsuddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent and emitted fromit a terrible flash of fire accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke anda noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder</s>  as the smoke clearedaway we saw one of the odd mananimals standing near the head of thelarge beast with a trumpet in his hand through which putting it tohis mouth he presently addressed us in loud harsh and disagreeableaccents that perhaps we should have mistaken for language had theynot come altogether through the nose</s> being thus evidently spoken to i was at a loss how to reply as icould in no manner understand what was said and in this difficultyi turned to the porter who was near swooning through affright anddemanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was whatit wanted and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmedupon its back</s>  to this the porter replied as well as he could fortrepidation that he had once before heard of this seabeast that itwas a cruel demon with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire createdby evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind that thethings upon its back were vermin such as sometimes infest cats anddogs only a little larger and more savage and that these vermin hadtheir uses however evilfor through the torture they caused the beastby their nibbling and stingings it was goaded into that degree of wrathwhich was requisite to make it roar and commit ill and so fulfil thevengeful and malicious designs of the wicked genii</s> this account determined me to take to my heels and without once evenlooking behind me i ran at full speed up into the hills while theporter ran equally fast although nearly in an opposite direction sothat by these means he finally made his escape with my bundles ofwhich i have no doubt he took excellent carealthough this is a point icannot determine as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again</s> for myself i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the menvermin whohad come to the shore in boats that i was very soon overtaken boundhand and foot and conveyed to the beast which immediately swam outagain into the middle of the sea</s> i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home toperil my life in such adventures as this but regret being useless imade the best of my condition and exerted myself to secure the goodwillof the mananimal that owned the trumpet and who appeared to exerciseauthority over his fellows</s>  i succeeded so well in this endeavor thatin a few days the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of hisfavor and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me therudiments of what it was vain enough to denominate its language sothat at length i was enabled to converse with it readily and came tomake it comprehend the ardent desire i had of seeing the world</s> washish squashish squeak sinbad heydiddle diddle grunt untgrumble hiss fiss whiss said he to me one day after dinnerbuti beg a thousand pardons i had forgotten that your majesty is notconversant with the dialect of the cockneighs so the mananimals werecalled i presume because their language formed the connectinglink between

excellent fellow we are now about doing a thing which is calledcircumnavigating the globe and since you are so desirous of seeing theworld i will strain a point and give you a free passage upon back ofthe beast</s> when the lady scheherazade had proceeded thus far relates theisitsoornot the king turned over from his left side to his right andsaidit is in fact very surprising my dear queen that you omittedhitherto these latter adventures of sinbad</s>  do you know i think themexceedingly entertaining and strange</s> the king having thus expressed himself we are told the fairscheherazade resumed her history in the following wordssinbad went on in this manner with his narrative to the caliphithanked the mananimal for its kindness and soon found myself very muchat home on the beast which swam at a prodigious rate through the oceanalthough the surface of the latter is in that part of the world byno means flat but round like a pomegranate so that we wentso tosayeither up hill or down hill all the time</s> that i think was very singular interrupted the king</s> nevertheless it is quite true replied scheherazade</s> i have my doubts rejoined the king but pray be so good as to goon with the story</s> i will said the queen</s>  the beast continued sinbad to the caliphswam as i have related up hill and down hill until at length wearrived at an island many hundreds of miles in circumference butwhich nevertheless had been built in the middle of the sea by a colonyof little things like caterpillars 1hum</s>  said the king</s> leaving this island said sinbadfor scheherazade it must beunderstood took no notice of her husbands illmannered ejaculationleaving this island we came to another where the forests were of solidstone and so hard that they shivered to pieces the finesttempered axeswith which we endeavoured to cut them down</s>  2hum</s>  said the king again but scheherazade paying him no attentioncontinued in the language of sinbad</s> passing beyond this last island we reached a country where therewas a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within thebowels of the earth and that contained a greater number of far morespacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in alldamascus and bagdad</s>  from the roofs of these palaces there hung myriadsof gems liked diamonds but larger than men and in among the streetsof towers and pyramids and temples there flowed immense rivers as blackas ebony and swarming with fish that had no eyes</s>  3hum</s>  said the king</s>  we then swam into a region of the sea wherewe found a lofty mountain down whose sides there streamed torrents ofmelted metal some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long4 while from an abyss on the summit issued so vast a quantity ofashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens and itbecame darker than the darkest midnight so that when we were even atthe distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain it wasimpossible to see the whitest object however close we held it to oureyes</s>  5hum</s>  said the king</s> after quitting this coast the beast continued his voyage until we metwith a land in which the nature of things seemed reversedfor we heresaw a great lake at the bottom of which more than a hundred feetbeneath the surface of the water there flourished in full leaf a forestof tall and luxuriant trees</s>  6hoo</s>  said the king</s> some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where theatmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel just as our owndoes feather</s>

land was the kingdom of horror and to enter it was inevitabledeath 8humph</s>  said the king</s> we left this kingdom in great haste and after some days came toanother where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrousanimals with horns resembling scythes upon their heads</s>  these hideousbeasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil of a funnel shapeand line the sides of them with rocks so disposed one upon the otherthat they fall instantly when trodden upon by other animals thusprecipitating them into the monsters dens where their blood isimmediately sucked and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuouslyout to an immense distance from the caverns of death</s>  9pooh</s>  said the king</s> continuing our progress we perceived a district with vegetables thatgrew not upon any soil but in the air</s>  10 there were others thatsprang from the substance of other vegetables 11 others that derivedtheir substance from the bodies of living animals 12 and then againthere were others that glowed all over with intense fire 13 othersthat moved from place to place at pleasure 14 and what was stillmore wonderful we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and movedtheir limbs at will and had moreover the detestable passion of mankindfor enslaving other creatures and confining them in horrid and solitaryprisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks</s>  15pshaw</s>  said the king</s> quitting this land we soon arrived at another in which the bees andthe birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition that theygive daily instructions

bees and the other by the birds but the kingkeeping their solution a secret it was only after the most profoundresearches and labor and the writing of an infinity of big booksduring a long series of years that the menmathematicians at lengtharrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot bythe bees and by the birds</s>  16oh my</s>  said the king</s> we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselvesclose upon another from whose shores there flew over our heads a flockof fowls a mile in breadth and two hundred and forty miles long sothat although they

passed immediately beneath this continent swimming in between thelegs of the cow and after some hours found ourselves in a wonderfulcountry indeed which i was informed by the mananimal was his

swaying and sweltering motionand sending forth to the winds an appalling voice half shriek halfroar such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up inits agony to heaven</s> the mountain trembled to its very base and the rock rocked</s>  i threwmyself upon my face and clung to the scant herbage in an excess ofnervous agitation</s> this said i at length to the old manthis can be

horror of the sceneor of the wildbewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder</s>  i am notsure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it nor atwhat time but it could neither have been from the summit of helseggennor during a storm</s>  there are some passages of his descriptionnevertheless which may be quoted for their details although theireffect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of thespectacle</s> between lofoden and moskoe he says the depth of the water isbetween thirtysix and forty fathoms but on the other side toward vervurrgh this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passagefor a vessel without the risk of splitting on the rocks which happenseven in the calmest weather</s>  when it is flood the stream runs up thecountry between lofoden and moskoe with a boisterous rapidity but theroar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudestand most dreadful cataracts the noise being heard several leagues

 in the year 1645 early in the morning of sexagesima sundayit raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of thehouses on the coast fell to the ground</s> in regard to the depth of the water i could not see how this could havebeen ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex</s>  theforty fathoms must have reference only to portions of the channelclose upon the shore either of moskoe or lofoden</s>  the depth in thecentre of the moskoestrm must be immeasurably greater and no betterproof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even thesidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from thehighest crag of helseggen</s>  looking down from this pinnacle upon thehowling phlegethon below i could not help smiling at the simplicitywith which the honest jonas ramus records as a matter difficult ofbelief the anecdotes of the whales and the bears for it appeared tome in fact a selfevident thing that the largest ship of the line

phenomenonsome of which i rememberseemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusalnow wore a verydifferent and unsatisfactory aspect</s>  the idea generally received is thatthis as well as three smaller vortices among the ferroe islands haveno other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling at fluxand reflux against a ridge of rocks and shelves which confines thewater so that it precipitates itself like a cataract and thus thehigher the flood rises the deeper must the fall be and the naturalresult of all is a whirlpool or vortex the prodigious suction of whichis sufficiently

assentedand mentioning it to the guide i was rather surprised to hear him saythat although it was the view almost universally entertained of thesubject by the norwegians it nevertheless was not his own</s>  as to theformer notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it and here iagreed with himfor however conclusive on paper it becomes altogetherunintelligible and even absurd amid the thunder of the abyss</s> you have had a good look at the whirl now said the old man and ifyou will creep round this crag so as to get in its lee and deadenthe roar of the water i will tell you a story that will convince you iought to know something of the moskoestrm</s> i placed myself as desired and he proceeded</s> myself and my two brothers once owned a schoonerrigged smack of aboutseventy tons burthen with which we were in the habit of fishing amongthe islands beyond moskoe nearly to vurrgh</s>  in all violent eddies atsea there is good fishing at proper opportunities if one has only thecourage to attempt it but among the whole of the lofoden coastmen wethree were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to theislands as i tell you</s>  the usual grounds are a great way lower down tothe southward</s>  there fish can be got at all hours without much riskand therefore these places are preferred</s>  the choice spots over hereamong the rocks however not only yield the finest variety but in fargreater abundance so that we often got in a single day what the moretimid of the craft could not scrape together in a week</s>  in fact we madeit a matter of desperate speculationthe risk of life standing insteadof labor and courage answering for capital</s> we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast thanthis and it was our practice in fine weather to take advantage ofthe fifteen minutes slack to push across the main channel of themoskoestrm far above the pool and then drop down upon anchoragesomewhere near otterholm or sandflesen where the eddies are not soviolent as elsewhere</s>  here we used to remain until nearly time forslackwater again when we weighed and made for home</s>  we never setout upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going andcomingone that we felt sure would not fail us before our returnandwe seldom made a miscalculation upon this point</s>  twice during sixyears we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a deadcalm which is a rare thing indeed just about here and once we had toremain on the grounds nearly a week starving to death owing to agale which blew up shortly after our arrival and made the channel tooboisterous to be thought of</s>  upon this occasion we should have beendriven out to sea in spite of everything for the whirlpools threw usround and round so violently that at length we fouled our anchorand dragged it if it had not been that we drifted into one of theinnumerable cross currentshere today and gone tomorrowwhich droveus under the lee of flimen where by good luck we brought up</s> i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties weencountered on the groundsit is a bad spot to be in even ingood weatherbut we made shift always to run the gauntlet of themoskoestrm itself without accident although at times my heart hasbeen in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or beforethe slack</s>  the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it atstarting and then we made rather less way than we could wish whilethe current rendered the smack unmanageable</s>  my eldest brother had a soneighteen years old and i had two stout boys of my own</s>  these would havebeen of great assistance at such times in using the sweeps as well asafterward in fishingbut somehow although we ran the risk ourselveswe had not the heart to let the young ones get into the dangerforafter all is said and done it was a horrible danger and that is thetruth</s> it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going totell you occurred</s>  it was on the tenth day of july 18 a day which thepeople of this part of the world will never forgetfor it was onein which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out ofthe heavens</s>  and yet all the morning and indeed until late in theafternoon there was a gentle and steady breeze from the southwestwhile the sun shone brightly so that the oldest seaman among us couldnot have foreseen what was to follow</s> the three of usmy two brothers and myselfhad crossed over to theislands about two oclock p</s>  m</s>  and had soon nearly loaded the smackwith fine fish which we all remarked were more plenty that daythan we had ever known them</s>  it was just seven by my watch when weweighed and started for home so as to make the worst of the strm atslack water which we knew would be at eight</s> we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter and for sometime spanked along at a great rate never dreaming of danger for indeedwe saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it</s>  all at once wewere taken aback by a breeze from over helseggen</s>  this was mostunusualsomething that had never happened to us beforeand i began tofeel a little uneasy without exactly knowing why</s>  we put the boat onthe wind but could make no headway at all for the eddies and i wasupon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage when lookingastern we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular coppercoloredcloud that rose with the most amazing velocity</s> in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away and wewere dead becalmed drifting about in every direction</s>  this state ofthings however did not last long enough to give us time to think aboutit</s>  in less than a minute the storm was upon usin less than two thesky was entirely overcastand what with this and the driving spray itbecame suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack</s> such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing</s>  theoldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it</s>  we had letour sails go by the run before it cleverly took us but at the firstpuff both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawedoffthe mainmast taking with it my youngest brother who had lashedhimself to it for safety</s> our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water</s> it had a complete flush deck with only a small hatch near the bow andthis hatch it had always been our custom to batten down when about tocross the strm by way of precaution against the chopping seas</s>  but forthis circumstance we should have foundered at oncefor we lay entirelyburied for some moments</s>  how my elder brother escaped destruction icannot say for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining</s>  for my partas soon as i had let the foresail run i threw myself flat on deckwith my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow and with my handsgrasping a ringbolt near the foot of the foremast</s>  it was mereinstinct that prompted me to do thiswhich was undoubtedly the verybest thing i could have donefor i was too much flurried to think</s> for some moments we were completely deluged as i say and all thistime i held my breath and clung to the bolt</s>  when i could stand it nolonger i raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with my handsand thus got my head clear</s>  presently our little boat gave herselfa shake just as a dog does in coming out of the water and thus ridherself in some measure of the seas</s>  i was now trying to get thebetter of the stupor that had come over me and to collect my senses soas to see what was to be done when i felt somebody grasp my arm</s>  it wasmy elder brother and my heart leaped for joy for i had made surethat he was overboardbut the next moment all this joy was turned intohorrorfor he put his mouth close to my ear and screamed out the wordmoskoestrm</s> no one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment</s>  i shookfrom head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague</s>  iknew what he meant by that one word well enoughi knew what he wishedto make me understand</s>  with the wind that now drove us on we were boundfor the whirl of the strm and nothing could save us</s> you perceive that in crossing the strm channel we always went along way up above the whirl even in the calmest weather and then hadto wait and watch carefully for the slackbut now we were driving rightupon the pool itself and in such a hurricane as this</s>  to be sure ithought we shall get there just about the slackthere is some littlehope in thatbut in the next moment i cursed myself for being so greata fool as to dream of hope at all</s>  i knew very well that we were doomedhad we been ten times a ninetygun ship</s> by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself or perhapswe did not feel it so much as we scudded before it but at all eventsthe seas which at first had been kept down by the wind and lay flatand frothing now got up into absolute mountains</s>  a singular changetoo had come over the heavens</s>  around in every direction it was stillas black as pitch but nearly overhead there burst out all at once acircular rift of clear skyas clear as i ever sawand of a deep brightblueand through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre thati never before knew her to wear</s>  she lit up every thing about us withthe greatest distinctnessbut oh god what a scene it was to light up</s> i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brotherbut in somemanner which i could not understand the din had so increased that icould not make him hear a single word although i screamed at the topof my voice in his ear</s>  presently he shook his head looking as pale asdeath and held up one of his finger as if to say listen</s>  at first i could not make out what he meantbut soon a hideous thoughtflashed upon me</s>  i dragged my watch from its fob</s>  it was not going</s>  iglanced at its face by the moonlight and then burst into tears as iflung it far away into the ocean</s>  it had run down at seven oclock</s> we were behind the time of the slack and the whirl of the strm was infull fury</s> when a boat is well built properly trimmed and not deep laden thewaves in a strong gale when she is going large seem always to slipfrom beneath herwhich appears very strange to a landsmanand this iswhat is called riding in sea phrase</s>  well so far we had ridden theswells very cleverly but presently a gigantic sea happened to take usright under the counter and bore us with it as it roseupupasif into the sky</s>  i would not have believed that any wave could rise sohigh</s>  and then down we came with a sweep a slide and a plungethat made me feel sick and dizzy as if i was falling from some loftymountaintop in a dream</s>  but while we were up i had thrown a quickglance aroundand that one glance was all sufficient</s>  i saw our exactposition in an instant</s>  the moskoestrm whirlpool was about a quarterof a mile dead aheadbut no more like the everyday moskoestrm thanthe whirl as you now see it is like a millrace</s>  if i had not knownwhere we were and what we

more than two minutes afterward until wesuddenly felt the waves subside and were enveloped in foam</s>  theboat made a sharp half turn to larboard and then shot off in its newdirection like a thunderbolt</s>  at the same moment the roaring noise ofthe water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shrieksuch asound as you might imagine given out by the wastepipes of many thousandsteamvessels letting off their steam all together</s>  we were now in thebelt of surf that always surrounds the whirl and i thought of coursethat another moment would plunge us into the abyssdown which we couldonly see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which wewore borne along</s>  the boat did not seem to sink into the water atall but to skim like an airbubble upon the surface of the surge</s>  herstarboard side was next the whirl and on the larboard arose the worldof ocean we had left</s>  it stood like a huge writhing wall between us andthe horizon</s> it may appear strange but now when we were in the very jaws of thegulf i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it</s>  havingmade up my mind to hope no more i got rid of a great deal of thatterror which unmanned me at first</s>  i suppose it was despair that strungmy nerves</s> it may look like boastingbut what i tell you is truthi began toreflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner and howfoolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my ownindividual life in view of so wonderful a manifestation of gods power</s> i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind</s> after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity aboutthe whirl itself</s>  i positively felt a wish to explore its depths evenat the sacrifice i was going to make and my principal grief was thati should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about themysteries i should see</s>  these no doubt were singular fancies to occupya mans mind in such extremityand i have often thought since that therevolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a littlelightheaded</s> there was another circumstance which tended to restore myselfpossession and this was the cessation of the wind which could notreach us in our present situationfor as you saw yourself the belt ofsurf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean and thislatter now towered above us a high black mountainous ridge</s>  if youhave never been at sea in a heavy gale you can form no idea of theconfusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together</s>  theyblind deafen and strangle you and take away all power of actionor reflection</s>  but we were now in a great measure rid of theseannoyancesjust as deathcondemned felons in prison are allowed pettyindulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain</s> how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say</s> we careered round and round for perhaps an hour flying rather thanfloating getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surgeand then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge</s>  all this time ihad never let go of the ringbolt</s>  my brother was at the stern holdingon to a small empty watercask which had been securely lashed under thecoop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that had not beenswept overboard when the gale first took us</s>  as we approached the brinkof the pit he let go his hold upon this and made for the ring fromwhich in the agony of his terror he endeavored to force my hands asit was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp</s>  i never feltdeeper grief than when i saw him attempt this actalthough i knew hewas a madman when he did ita raving maniac through sheer fright</s>  i didnot care however to contest the point with him</s>  i knew it could makeno difference whether either of us held on at all so i let him have thebolt and went astern to the cask</s>  this there was no great difficultyin doing for the smack flew round steadily enough and upon an evenkeelonly swaying to and fro with the immense sweeps and swelters ofthe whirl</s>  scarcely had i secured myself in my new position when wegave a wild lurch to starboard and rushed headlong into the abyss</s>  imuttered a hurried prayer to god and thought all was over</s> as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent i had instinctivelytightened my hold upon the barrel and closed my eyes</s>  for some secondsi dared not open themwhile i expected instant destruction andwondered that i was not

beforewhile in the belt of foam with the exception that she now lay morealong</s>  i took courage and looked once again upon the scene</s> never shall i forget the sensations of awe horror and admiration withwhich i gazed about me</s>  the boat appeared to be hanging as if bymagic midway down upon the interior surface of a funnel vast incircumference prodigious in depth and whose perfectly smooth sidesmight have been mistaken for ebony but for the bewildering rapiditywith which they spun around and for the gleaming and ghastly radiancethey shot forth as the rays of the full moon from that circular riftamid the clouds which i have already described streamed in a flood ofgolden glory along the black walls and far away down into the inmostrecesses of the abyss</s> at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately</s> the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld</s>  when irecovered myself a little however my gaze fell instinctively downward</s> in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view from themanner in which the smack hung on the inclined surface of the pool</s>  shewas quite upon an even keelthat is to say her deck lay in a planeparallel with that of the waterbut this latter sloped at an angle ofmore than fortyfive degrees so that we seemed to be lying upon ourbeamends</s>  i could not help observing nevertheless that i had scarcelymore difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situationthan if we had been upon a dead level and this i suppose was owing tothe speed at which we revolved</s> the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profoundgulf but still i could make out nothing distinctly on account of athick mist in which everything there was enveloped and over which therehung a magnificent rainbow like that narrow and tottering bridge whichmussulmen say is the only pathway between time and eternity</s>  this mistor spray was no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls ofthe funnel as they all met together at the bottombut the yell thatwent up to the heavens from out of that mist i dare not attempt todescribe</s> our first slide into the abyss itself from the belt of foam above hadcarried us a great distance down the slope but our farther descentwas by no means proportionate</s>  round and round we sweptnot withany uniform movementbut in dizzying swings and jerks that sentus sometimes only a few hundred yardssometimes nearly the completecircuit of the whirl</s>  our progress downward at each revolution wasslow but very perceptible</s> looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we werethus borne i perceived that our boat was not the only object in theembrace of the whirl</s>  both above and below us were visible fragments ofvessels large masses of building timber and trunks of trees withmany smaller articles such as pieces of house furniture broken boxesbarrels and staves</s>  i have already described the unnatural curiositywhich had taken the place of my original terrors</s>  it appeared to growupon me as i drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom</s>  i now began towatch with a strange interest the numerous things that floated in ourcompany</s>  i must have been deliriousfor i even sought amusementin speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descentstoward the foam below</s>  this fir tree i found myself at one timesaying will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plungeand disappearsand then i was disappointed to find that the wreck ofa dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before</s>  at length aftermaking several guesses of this nature and being deceived in allthisfactthe fact of my invariable miscalculationset me upon a train ofreflection that made my limbs again tremble and my heart beat heavilyonce more</s> it was not a new terror that thus affected me but the dawn of a moreexciting hope</s>  this hope arose partly from memory and partly frompresent observation</s>  i called to mind the great variety of buoyantmatter that strewed the coast of lofoden having been absorbed andthen thrown forth by the moskoestrm</s>  by far the greater number of thearticles were shattered in the most extraordinary wayso chafedand roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full ofsplintersbut then i distinctly recollected that there were some ofthem which were not disfigured at all</s>  now i could not account for thisdifference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were theonly ones which had been completely absorbedthat the others hadentered the whirl at so late a period of the tide or for some reasonhad descended so slowly after entering that they did not reach thebottom before the turn of the flood came or of the ebb as the casemight be</s>  i conceived it possible in either instance that they mightthus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean without undergoingthe fate of those which had been drawn in more early or absorbed morerapidly</s>  i made also three important observations</s>  the first wasthat as a general rule the larger the bodies were the more rapidtheir descentthe second that between two masses of equal extent theone spherical and the other of any other shape the superiorityin speed of descent was with the spherethe third that between twomasses of equal size the one cylindrical and the other of any othershape the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly</s>  since my escape ihave had several conversations on this subject with an old schoolmasterof the district and it was from him that i learned the use of the wordscylinder and sphere</s>  he explained to mealthough i have forgottenthe explanationhow what i observed was in fact the naturalconsequence of the forms of the floating fragmentsand showed me how ithappened that a cylinder swimming in a vortex offered more resistanceto its suction and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equallybulky body of any form whatever</s>  1there was one startling circumstance which went a great way inenforcing these observations and rendering me anxious to turn them toaccount and this was that at every revolution we passed somethinglike a barrel or else the yard or the mast of a vessel while many ofthese things which had been on our level when i first opened my eyesupon the wonders of the whirlpool were now high up above us and seemedto have moved but little from their original station</s> i no longer hesitated what to do</s>  i resolved to lash myself securely tothe water cask upon which i now held to cut it loose from the counterand to throw myself with it into the water</s>  i attracted my brothersattention by signs pointed to the floating barrels that came near usand did everything in my power to make him understand what i was aboutto do</s>  i thought at length that he comprehended my designbut whetherthis was the case or not he shook his head despairingly and refused tomove from his station by the ringbolt</s>  it was impossible to reach himthe emergency admitted of no delay and so with a bitter struggle iresigned him to his fate fastened myself to the cask by means of thelashings which secured it to the counter and precipitated myself withit into the sea without another moments hesitation</s> the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be</s>  as it is myselfwho now tell you this taleas you see that i did escapeand as youare already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effectedand must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to sayi willbring my story quickly to conclusion</s>  it might have been an hour orthereabout after my quitting the smack when having descended to avast distance beneath me it made three or four wild gyrations in rapidsuccession and bearing my loved brother with it plunged headlong atonce and forever into the chaos of foam below</s>  the barrel to which iwas attached sunk very little farther than half the

of my suggestion</s> the fact is sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the worldto commit himself on scientific topics</s>  not only had he a more thanordinary dislike to quackery but he was morbidly afraid of appearingempirical so that however fully he might have been convinced that hewas on the right track in the matter now in question he would neverhave spoken out until he had every

there can be no manner of doubt</s>  whether itescaped the flames by good fortune or by bad yet remains to be seen</s> that the passages quoted above with the other similar ones referred togave von kempelen the hint i do not in the slightest degree questionbut i repeat it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discoveryitself momentous under any circumstances will be of service

severalmisapprehensions of the german original seem to have been made by thetranslator who professes to have taken the passage from a late numberof the presburg schnellpost</s>  viele has evidently been misconceivedas it often is and what the translator renders by sorrows isprobably lieden which in its true version sufferings would givea totally different complexion to the whole account but of coursemuch of this is merely guess on my part</s> von kempelen however is by no means a misanthrope in appearance atleast whatever he may be in fact</s>  my acquaintance with him was casualaltogether and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know himat all but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious anotoriety as he has attained or will attain in a few days is not asmall matter

in the lattercity that his great discovery was first made public or rather it wasthere that he was first suspected of having made it</s>  this is about allthat i personally know of the now immortal von kempelen but i havethought that even these few details would have interest for the public</s> there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloatabout this affair are pure inventions entitled to about as much creditas the story of aladdins lamp and yet in a case of this kind as inthe case of the discoveries in california it is clear that the truthmay be stranger than fiction</s>  the following anecdote at least is sowell authenticated that we may receive it implicitly</s> von kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residenceat bremen and often it was well known he had been put to extremeshifts in order to raise trifling sums</s>  when the great excitementoccurred about the forgery on the house of gutsmuth  co</s>  suspicionwas directed toward von kempelen on account of his having purchaseda considerable property in gasperitch lane and his refusing whenquestioned to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money</s>  hewas at length arrested but nothing decisive appearing against him wasin the end set at liberty</s>  the police however kept a strict watch uponhis movements and thus discovered that he left home frequently takingalways the same road and invariably giving his watchers the slip in theneighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages knownby the flash name of the dondergat</s>  finally by dint of greatperseverance they traced him to a garret in an old house of sevenstories in an alley called flatzplatzand coming upon him suddenlyfound him as they imagined in the midst of his counterfeitingoperations</s>  his agitation is represented as so excessive that theofficers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt</s>  after handcuffinghim they searched his room or rather rooms for it appears he occupiedall the mansarde</s> opening into the garret where they caught him was a closet ten feet byeight fitted up with some chemical apparatus of which the object hasnot yet been ascertained</s>  in one corner of the closet was a very smallfurnace with a glowing fire in it and on the fire a kind of duplicatecrucibletwo crucibles connected by a tube</s>  one of these crucibles wasnearly full of lead in a state of fusion but not reaching up to theaperture of the tube which was close to the brim</s>  the other cruciblehad some liquid in it which as the officers entered seemed to befuriously dissipating in vapor</s>  they relate that on finding himselftaken kempelen seized the crucibles with both hands which were encasedin gloves that afterwards turned out to be asbestic and threw thecontents on the tiled floor</s>  it was now that they handcuffed him andbefore proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person butnothing unusual was found about him excepting a paper parcel in hiscoatpocket containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixtureof antimony and some unknown substance in nearly but not quite equalproportions</s>  all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance haveso far failed but that it will ultimately be analyzed is not to bedoubted</s> passing out of the closet with their prisoner the officers went througha sort of antechamber in which nothing material was found to thechemists sleepingroom</s>  they here rummaged some drawers and boxesbut discovered only a few papers of no importance and some good coinsilver and gold</s>  at length looking under the bed they saw a largecommon hair trunk without hinges hasp or lock and with the top lyingcarelessly across the bottom portion</s>  upon attempting to draw this trunkout from under the bed they found that with their united strengththere were three of them all powerful men they could not stir itone inch</s>  much astonished at this one of them crawled under the bedand looking into the trunk saidno wonder we couldnt move itwhy its full to the brim of old bits ofbrass</s> putting his feet now against the wall so as to get a good purchaseand pushing with all his force while his companions pulled with alltheirs the trunk with much difficulty was slid out from under thebed and its contents examined</s>  the supposed brass with which it wasfilled was all in small smooth pieces varying from the size of a peato that of a dollar but the pieces were irregular in shape althoughmore or less flatlooking upon the whole very much as lead looks whenthrown upon the ground in a molten state and there suffered to growcool</s>  now not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metalto be any thing but brass</s>  the idea of its being gold never enteredtheir brains of course how could such a wild fancy have entered it</s> and their astonishment may be well conceived when the next day itbecame known all over bremen that the lot of brass which theyhad carted so contemptuously to the police office without puttingthemselves to the trouble of pocketing the smallest scrap was not onlygoldreal goldbut gold far finer than any employed in coinagegoldin fact absolutely pure virgin without the slightest appreciablealloy</s> i need not go over the details of von kempelens confession as far asit went and release for these are familiar to the public</s>  that he hasactually realized in spirit and in effect if not to the letter theold chimaera of the philosophers stone no sane person is at libertyto doubt</s>  the opinions of arago are of course entitled to the greatestconsideration but he is by no means infallible and what he says ofbismuth in his report to the academy must be taken cum grano salis</s> the simple truth is that up to this period all analysis has failed anduntil von kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own publishedenigma it is more than probable that the matter will remain for yearsin statu quo</s>  all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is thatpure gold can be made at will and very readily from lead in connectionwith certain other substances in kind and in proportions unknown</s> speculation of course is busy as to the immediate and ultimate resultsof this discoverya discovery which few thinking persons will hesitatein referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generallyby the late developments in california and this reflection brings usinevitably to anotherthe exceeding inopportuneness of von kempelensanalysis</s>
 if many were prevented from adventuring to california by themere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in valueon account of its plentifulness in the mines there as to renderthe speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful onewhatimpression will be wrought now upon the minds of those about toemigrate and especially upon the minds of those actually in themineral region by the announcement of this astounding discovery of vonkempelen</s>  a discovery which declares in so many words that beyond itsintrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes whatever that worth may begold now is or at least soon will be for it cannot be supposed thatvon kempelen can long retain his secret of no greater value thanlead and of far inferior value to silver</s>  it is indeed exceedinglydifficult to speculate prospectively upon the consequences of thediscovery but one thing may be positively maintainedthat theannouncement of the discovery six months ago would have had materialinfluence in regard to the settlement of california</s> in europe as yet the most noticeable results have been a rise of twohundred per cent</s>  in the price of lead and nearly twentyfive per

other normal condition within our cognizance thatwhile in this state the person so impressed employs only with effortand then feebly the external organs of sense yet perceives withkeenly refined

the patients condition</s>  the leftlung had been for eighteen months in a semiosseous or cartilaginousstate and was of course entirely useless for all purposes ofvitality</s>  the right in its upper

discovered a month before andthe adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days</s> independently of the phthisis the patient was suspected of aneurismof the aorta but on this point

agreed to look in upon thepatient about ten the next night</s> when they had gone i spoke freely with m</s>  valdemar on the subjectof his approaching dissolution as well as more particularly of

to wait for the physicians but i was induced toproceed first by the urgent entreaties of m</s>  valdemar and secondlyby my conviction that i had not a moment to lose as he was evidentlysinking fast</s> mr</s>  ll was so kind as to accede to my desire that he would take notesof all that occurred and it is from his memoranda that what i now haveto relate is for the most part either condensed or copied verbatim</s> it wanted about five minutes of eight when taking the patients hand ibegged him to state as distinctly as he could to mr</s>  ll whether hem</s>  valdemar was entirely willing that i should make the experiment ofmesmerizing him in his then condition</s> he replied feebly yet quite audibly yes i wish to be</s>  i fear youhave mesmerizedadding immediately afterwards deferred it too long</s> while he spoke thus i commenced the passes which i had already foundmost effectual in subduing him</s>  he was evidently influenced with thefirst lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead but although iexerted all my powers no farther perceptible effect was induceduntil some minutes after ten oclock when doctors d and f calledaccording to appointment</s>  i explained to them in a few words what idesigned and as they opposed no objection saying that the patient wasalready in the death agony i proceeded without hesitationexchanginghowever the lateral passes for downward ones and directing my gazeentirely into the right eye of the sufferer</s> by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing wasstertorous and at intervals of half a minute</s> this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour</s>  at theexpiration of this period however a natural although a very deepsigh escaped the bosom of the dying man and the stertorous breathingceasedthat is to say its stertorousness was no longer apparent theintervals were undiminished</s>  the patients extremities were of an icycoldness</s> at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of themesmeric influence</s>  the glassy roll of the eye was changed for thatexpression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except incases of sleepwaking and which it is quite impossible to mistake</s> with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver as in incipientsleep and with a few more i closed them altogether</s>  i was notsatisfied however with this but continued the manipulationsvigorously and with the fullest exertion of the will until i hadcompletely stiffened the limbs of the slumberer after placing them ina seemingly easy position</s>  the legs were at full length the arms werenearly so and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the loin</s> the head was very slightly elevated</s> when i had accomplished this it was fully midnight and i requestedthe gentlemen present to examine m</s>  valdemars condition</s>  after a fewexperiments they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state ofmesmeric trance</s>  the curiosity of both the physicians was greatlyexcited</s>  dr</s>  d resolved at once to remain with the patient allnight while dr</s>  f took leave with a promise to return at daybreak</s> mr</s>  ll and the nurses remained</s> we left m</s>  valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three oclock inthe morning when i approached him and found him in precisely the samecondition as when dr</s>  fwent awaythat is to say he lay in thesame position the pulse was imperceptible the breathing was gentlescarcely noticeable unless through the application of a mirror to thelips the eyes were closed naturally and the limbs were as rigid andas cold as marble</s>  still the general appearance was certainly not thatof death</s> as i approached m</s>  valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influencehis right arm into pursuit of my own as i passed the latter gentlyto and fro above his person</s>  in such experiments with this patient hadnever perfectly succeeded before and assuredly i had little thought ofsucceeding now but to my astonishment his arm very readily althoughfeebly followed every direction i assigned it with mine</s>  i determinedto hazard a few words of conversation</s> m</s>  valdemar i said are you asleep</s>  he made no answer but iperceived a tremor about the lips and was thus induced to repeat thequestion again and again</s>  at its third repetition his whole frame wasagitated by a very slight shivering the eyelids unclosed themselves sofar as to display a white line of the ball the lips moved sluggishlyand from between them in a barely audible whisper issued the wordsyesasleep now</s>  do not wake me</s> let me die so</s> i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever</s>  the right armas before obeyed the direction of my hand</s>  i questioned the sleepwakeragaindo you still feel pain in the breast m</s>  valdemar</s> the answer now was immediate but even less audible than before nopaini am dying</s> i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then andnothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr</s>  f who came alittle before sunrise and expressed unbounded astonishment at findingthe patient still alive</s>  after feeling the pulse and applying a mirrorto the lips he requested me to speak to the sleepwaker again</s>  i didso sayingm</s>  valdemar do you still sleep</s> as before some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made and during theinterval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak</s> at my fourth repetition of the question he said very faintly almostinaudiblyyes still asleepdying</s> it was now the opinion or rather the wish of the physicians thatm</s>  valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his presentapparently tranquil condition until death should superveneand thisit was generally agreed must now take place within a few minutes</s>  iconcluded however to speak to him once more and merely repeated myprevious question</s> while i spoke there came a marked change over the countenance ofthe sleepwaker</s>  the eyes rolled themselves slowly open the pupilsdisappearing upwardly the skin generally assumed a cadaverous hueresembling not so much parchment as white paper and the circular hecticspots which hitherto had been strongly defined in the centre of eachcheek went out at once</s>  i use this expression because thesuddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as theextinguishment of a candle by a puff of the breath</s>  the upper lipat the same time writhed itself away from the teeth which it hadpreviously covered completely while the lower jaw fell with an audiblejerk leaving the mouth widely extended and disclosing in full view theswollen and blackened tongue</s>  i presume that no member of the partythen present had been unaccustomed to deathbed horrors but so hideousbeyond conception was the appearance of m</s>  valdemar at this moment thatthere was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed</s> i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which everyreader will be startled into positive disbelief</s>  it is my businesshowever simply to proceed</s> there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m</s>  valdemar andconcluding him to be dead we were consigning him to the charge of thenurses when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue</s> this continued for perhaps a minute</s>  at the expiration of this periodthere issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voicesuch as itwould be madness in me to attempt describing</s>  there are indeed two orthree epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part imight say for example that the sound was harsh and broken and hollowbut the hideous whole is indescribable for the simple reason that nosimilar sounds have ever jarred upon the ear of humanity</s>  there were twoparticulars nevertheless which i thought then and still think mightfairly be stated as characteristic of the intonationas well adapted toconvey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity</s>  in the first place thevoice seemed to reach our earsat least minefrom a vast distanceor from some deep cavern within the earth</s>  in the

the fall of the house of usher  son coeur est un luth suspendu  sitt quon le touche il rsonne</s> </s>        de branger</s>
during the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the autumn of theyear when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens i hadbeen passing alone on horseback through a singularly dreary tract ofcountry and at length found myself as the shades of the evening drewon within view of the melancholy house of usher</s>  i know not howit wasbut with the first glimpse of the building a sense ofinsufferable gloom pervaded my spirit</s>  i say insufferable for thefeeling was unrelieved by any of that halfpleasurable because poeticsentiment with which the mind usually receives even the sternestnatural images of the desolate or terrible</s>  i looked upon the scenebefore meupon the mere house and the simple landscape features of thedomainupon the bleak wallsupon the vacant eyelike windowsupon afew rank sedgesand upon a few white trunks of decayed treeswith anutter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensationmore properly than to the afterdream of the reveller upon opiumthebitter lapse into everyday lifethe hideous dropping off of the veil</s> there was an iciness a sinking a sickening of the heartan unredeemeddreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could tortureinto aught of the sublime</s>  what was iti paused to thinkwhat was itthat so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher</s>  it was amystery all insoluble nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies thatcrowded upon me as i pondered</s>  i was forced to fall back upon theunsatisfactory conclusion that while beyond doubt there arecombinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thusaffecting us still the analysis of this power lies among considerationsbeyond our depth</s>  it was possible i reflected that a mere differentarrangement of the particulars of the scene of the details of thepicture would be sufficient to modify or perhaps to annihilate itscapacity for sorrowful impression and acting upon this idea i reinedmy horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay inunruffled lustre by the dwelling and gazed downbut with a shuddereven more thrilling than beforeupon the remodelled and inverted imagesof the gray sedge and the ghastly treestems and the vacant andeyelike windows</s> nevertheless in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself asojourn of some weeks</s>  its proprietor roderick usher had been one ofmy boon companions in boyhood but many years had elapsed since our lastmeeting</s>  a letter however had lately reached me in a distant part ofthe countrya letter from himwhich in its wildly importunate naturehad admitted of no other than a personal reply</s>  the ms</s>  gave evidence ofnervous agitation</s>  the writer spoke of acute bodily illnessof a mentaldisorder which oppressed himand of an earnest desire to see me as hisbest and indeed his only personal friend with a view of attempting bythe cheerfulness of my society some alleviation of his malady</s>  itwas the manner in which all this and much more was saidit was theapparent heart that went with his requestwhich allowed me noroom for hesitation and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i stillconsidered a very singular summons</s> although as boys we had been even intimate associates yet i reallyknew little of my friend</s>  his reserve had been always excessive andhabitual</s>  i was aware however that his very ancient family had beennoted time out of mind for a peculiar sensibility of temperamentdisplaying itself through long ages in many works of exalted art andmanifested of late in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusivecharity as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies perhapseven more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties ofmusical science</s>  i had learned too the very remarkable fact that thestem of the usher race all timehonored as it was had put forth at noperiod any enduring branch in other words that the entire family layin the direct line of descent and had always with very trifling andvery temporary variation so lain</s>  it was this deficiency i consideredwhile running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character ofthe premises with the accredited character of the people and whilespeculating upon the possible influence which the one in the longlapse of centuries might have exercised upon the otherit was thisdeficiency perhaps of collateral issue and the consequent undeviatingtransmission from sire to son of the patrimony with the name whichhad at length so identified the two as to merge the original titleof the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the houseof usheran appellation which seemed to include in the minds of thepeasantry who used it both the family and the family mansion</s> i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childishexperimentthat of looking down within the tarnhad been to deepen thefirst singular impression</s>  there can be no doubt that the consciousnessof the rapid increase of my superstitionfor why should i not so termit</s> served mainly to accelerate the increase itself</s>  such i havelong known is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as abasis</s>  and it might have been for this reason only that when i againuplifted my eyes to the house itself from its image in the pool theregrew in my mind a strange fancya fancy so ridiculous indeed that ibut mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressedme</s>  i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe thatabout the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiarto themselves and their immediate vicinityan atmosphere which hadno affinity with the air of heaven but which had reeked up from thedecayed trees and the gray wall and the silent tarna pestilent andmystic vapor dull sluggish faintly discernible and leadenhued</s> shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream i scanned morenarrowly the real aspect of the building</s>  its principal feature seemedto be that of an excessive antiquity</s>  the discoloration of ages had beengreat</s>  minute fungi overspread the whole exterior hanging in a finetangled webwork from the eaves</s>  yet all this was apart from anyextraordinary dilapidation</s>  no portion of the masonry had fallen andthere appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfectadaptation of parts and the crumbling condition of the individualstones</s>  in this there was much that reminded me of the specious totalityof old woodwork which has rotted for long years in some neglectedvault with no disturbance from the breath of the external air</s>  beyondthis indication of extensive decay however the fabric gave littletoken of instability</s>  perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer mighthave discovered a barely perceptible fissure which extending from theroof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzagdirection until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn</s> noticing these things i rode over a short causeway to the house</s>  aservant in waiting took my horse and i entered the gothic archway ofthe hall</s>  a valet of stealthy step thence conducted me in silencethrough many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studioof his master</s>  much that i encountered on the way contributed i knownot how to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have alreadyspoken</s>  while the objects around mewhile the carvings of the ceilingsthe sombre tapestries of the walls the ebon blackness of the floorsand the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as i strode werebut matters to which or to such as which i had been accustomed from myinfancywhile i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was allthisi still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies whichordinary images were stirring up</s>  on one of the staircases i met thephysician of the family</s>  his countenance i thought wore a mingledexpression of low cunning and perplexity</s>  he accosted me withtrepidation and passed on</s>  the valet now threw open a door and usheredme into the presence of his master</s> the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty</s>  the windowswere long narrow and pointed and at so vast a distance from the blackoaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within</s>  feeble gleamsof encrimsoned light made their way through the trellissed panesand served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objectsaround the eye however struggled in vain to reach the remoter anglesof the chamber or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling</s> dark draperies hung upon the walls</s>  the general furniture was profusecomfortless antique and tattered</s>  many books and musical instrumentslay scattered about but failed to give any vitality to the scene</s>  ifelt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow</s>  an air of stern deep andirredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all</s> upon my entrance usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying atfull length and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much init i at first thought of an overdone cordialityof the constrainedeffort of the ennuy man of the world</s>  a glance however at hiscountenance convinced me of his perfect sincerity</s>  we sat down and forsome moments while he spoke not i gazed upon him with a feeling halfof pity half of awe</s>  surely man had never before so terribly alteredin so brief a period as had roderick usher</s>  it was with difficulty thati could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before mewith the companion of my early boyhood</s>  yet the character of his facehad been at all times remarkable</s>  a cadaverousness of complexion an eyelarge liquid and luminous beyond comparison lips somewhat thin andvery pallid but of a surpassingly beautiful curve a nose of adelicate hebrew model but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similarformations a finely moulded chin speaking in its want of prominenceof a want of moral energy hair of a more than weblike softness andtenuity these features with an inordinate expansion above the regionsof the temple made up altogether a countenance not easily to beforgotten</s>  and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing characterof these features and of the expression they were wont to convey layso much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke</s>  the now ghastly pallorof the skin and the now miraculous lustre of the eye above all thingsstartled and

arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity</s> in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an incoherenceaninconsistency and i soon found this to arise from a series of feebleand futile struggles to overcome an habitual trepidancyan excessivenervous agitation</s>  for something of this nature i had indeed beenprepared no less by his letter than by reminiscences of certainboyish traits and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physicalconformation and temperament</s>  his action was alternately vivacious andsullen</s>  his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision when theanimal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance to that species of energeticconcisionthat abrupt weighty unhurried and hollowsoundingenunciationthat leaden selfbalanced and perfectly modulatedguttural utterance which may be observed in the lost drunkard or theirreclaimable eater of opium during the periods of his most intenseexcitement</s> it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit of his earnestdesire to see me and of the solace he expected me to afford him</s>  heentered at some length into what he conceived to be the nature of hismalady</s>  it was he

host of unnatural sensations</s>  some of these as he detailedthem interested and bewildered me although perhaps the terms andthe general manner of the narration had their weight</s>  he suffered muchfrom a morbid acuteness of the senses the most insipid food was aloneendurable he could wear only garments of certain texture the odorsof all flowers were oppressive his eyes were tortured by even a faintlight and there were but peculiar sounds and these from stringedinstruments which did not inspire him with horror</s> to an anomalous species of terror i found him a bounden slave</s>  i

unnervedin thispitiable conditioni feel that the period will sooner or later arrivewhen i must abandon life and reason together in some struggle with thegrim phantasm fear</s> i learned moreover at intervals and through broken and equivocalhints another singular feature of his mental condition</s>  he wasenchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwellingwhich he tenanted

mere form and substance of his family mansion hadby dint of long sufferance he said obtained over his spiritan effectwhich the physique of the gray walls and turrets and of the dim tarninto which they all looked down had at length brought about upon themorale of his existence</s> he admitted however although with hesitation that much of thepeculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a morenatural and far more palpable originto the severe and longcontinuedillnessindeed to the evidently approaching dissolutionof a tenderlybeloved sisterhis sole companion for long yearshis last and

personand frequent although transient affections of a partially catalepticalcharacter were the unusual diagnosis</s>  hitherto she had steadily borneup against the pressure of her malady and had not betaken herselffinally to bed but on the closing in of the evening of my arrivalat the house she succumbed as her brother told me at night withinexpressible agitation to the prostrating power of the destroyerand i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thusprobably be the last i should obtainthat the lady at least whileliving would be seen by me no more</s> for several days ensuing her name was unmentioned by either usher ormyself and during this period i was busied in earnest endeavors toalleviate the melancholy of my friend</s>  we painted and read together ori

long improvised dirges will ring forever in my ears</s>  amongother things i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion andamplification of the wild air of the last waltz of von weber</s>  from thepaintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded and which grew touchby touch into vaguenesses at which i shuddered the more thrillinglybecause i shuddered knowing not whyfrom these paintings

 his chief delight however was found in the perusalof an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothicthe manual ofa forgotten churchthe vigiliae mortuorum secundum chorum ecclesiaemaguntinae</s> i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work and of itsprobable influence upon the hypochondriac when one evening havinginformed me abruptly that the lady madeline was no more he stated

the sinister countenance of theperson whom i met upon the staircase on the day of my arrival atthe house i had no desire to oppose what i regarded as at best but aharmless and by no means an unnatural

turn but feeling the rain upon hisshoulders and fearing the rising of the tempest uplifted his maceoutright and with blows made quickly room in the plankings of thedoor for his gauntleted hand and now pulling therewith sturdily he socracked and ripped and tore all asunder that the noise of the dry andhollowsounding wood alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest</s> at the termination of this sentence i started and for a moment pausedfor it appeared to me although i at once concluded that my excitedfancy had deceived meit appeared to me that from some very remoteportion of the mansion

so particularly described</s>  it was beyond doubtthe coincidence alone which had arrested my attention for amid therattling of the sashes of the casements and the ordinary comminglednoises of the still increasing storm the sound in itself had nothingsurely which should have interested or disturbed me</s>  i continued thestorybut the good champion ethelred now entering within the door was soreenraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful hermit butin the stead thereof a dragon of a scaly and prodigious demeanor andof a fiery tongue which sate in guard before a palace of gold with afloor of silver and upon the wall there hung a shield of shining brasswith this legend enwritten  who entereth herein a conqueror hath bin  who slayeth the dragon the shield he shall winand ethelred uplifted his mace and struck upon the head of the dragonwhich fell before him and gave up his pesty breath with a shriek sohorrid and harsh and withal so piercing that ethelred had fain

taken notice of all this i resumed the narrative of sirlauncelot which thus proceededand now the champion having escaped from the terrible fury of thedragon bethinking himself of the brazen shield and

up higher at therustling heaven and into the crimson moon</s>  and i lay close withinshelter of the lilies and observed the actions of the man</s>  and theman trembled in the solitudebut the night

pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathyof his fellowmen</s>  and the whole seizure progress and termination ofthe disease were the incidents of half an hour</s> but the prince prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious</s>  when hisdominions were half depopulated he summoned to his presence a thousandhale and lighthearted friends from among the knights and dames ofhis court and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of hiscastellated abbeys</s>  this was an extensive and magnificent structure thecreation of the princes own eccentric yet august taste</s>  a strong andlofty wall girdled it in</s>  this wall had gates of iron</s>  the courtiershaving entered brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts</s> they resolved to leave means neither of

or sixth month of his seclusionand while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad that the princeprospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the mostunusual magnificence</s> it was a voluptuous scene that masquerade</s>  but first let me tell of therooms in which it was held</s>  there were sevenan imperial suite</s>  in manypalaces however such suites form a long and straight vista while thefolding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand so thatthe view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded</s>  here the case wasvery different as might have been expected from the dukes love of thebizarre</s>  the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the visionembraced but little more than one at a time</s>  there was a sharp turn atevery twenty or thirty yards and at each turn a novel effect</s>  to theright and left in the middle of each wall a tall and narrow gothicwindow looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings ofthe suite</s>  these windows were of stained glass whose color varied inaccordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamberinto which it opened</s>  that at the eastern extremity was hung forexample in blueand vividly blue were its windows</s>  the second chamberwas purple in its ornaments and tapestries and here the panes werepurple</s>  the third was green throughout and so were the casements</s>  thefourth was furnished and lighted with orangethe fifth with whitethesixth with violet</s>  the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in blackvelvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the wallsfalling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue</s>  butin this chamber only the color of the windows failed to correspond withthe decorations</s>  the panes here were scarleta deep blood color</s>  now inno one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum amidthe profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro ordepended from the roof</s>  there was no light of any kind emanating fromlamp or candle within the suite of chambers</s>  but in the corridorsthat followed the suite there stood opposite to each window a heavytripod bearing a brazier of fire that protected its rays through thetinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room</s>  and thus were produceda multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances</s>  but in the western orblack chamber the effect of the firelight that streamed upon the darkhangings through the bloodtinted panes was ghastly in the extreme andproduced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who enteredthat there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within itsprecincts at all</s> it was in this apartment also that there stood against the westernwall a gigantic clock of ebony</s>  its pendulum swung to and fro with adull heavy monotonous clang and when the minutehand made the circuitof the face and the hour was to be stricken there came from thebrazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep andexceedingly musical but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that ateach lapse of an hour the musicians of the orchestra were constrainedto pause momentarily in their performance to hearken to the soundand thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions and there was abrief disconcert of the whole gay company and while the chimes of theclock yet rang it was observed that the giddiest grew pale and themore aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if inconfused reverie or meditation</s>  but when the echoes had fully ceaseda light laughter at once pervaded the assembly the musicians looked ateach other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and madewhispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clockshould produce in them no similar emotion and then after the lapse ofsixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds ofthe time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clockand then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation asbefore</s> but in spite of these things it was a gay and magnificent revel</s> the tastes of the duke were peculiar</s>  he had a fine eye for colors andeffects</s>  he disregarded the decora of mere fashion</s>  his plans were boldand fiery and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre</s>  there aresome who would have thought him mad</s>  his followers felt that he was not</s> it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he wasnot</s> he had directed in great part the moveable embellishments of the sevenchambers upon occasion of this great fete and it was his own guidingtaste which had given character to the masqueraders</s>  be sure theywere grotesque</s>  there were much glare and glitter and piquancy andphantasmmuch of what has been since seen in hernani</s>  there werearabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments</s>  there weredelirious fancies such as the madman fashions</s>  there was much of thebeautiful much of the wanton much of the bizarre something of theterrible and not a little of that which might have excited disgust</s> to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked in fact a multitude ofdreams</s>  and thesethe dreamswrithed in and about taking hue from therooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echoof their steps</s>  and anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands inthe hall of the velvet</s>  and then for a moment all is still and all issilent save the voice of the clock</s>  the dreams are stifffrozen as theystand</s>  but the echoes of the chime die awaythey have endured but aninstantand a light halfsubdued laughter floats after them as theydepart</s>  and now again the music swells and the dreams live and writheto and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the manytintedwindows through which stream the rays from the tripods</s>  but to thechamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none ofthe maskers who venture for the night is waning away and there flows aruddier light through the bloodcolored panes and the blackness of thesable drapery appals and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpetthere comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnlyemphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the moreremote gaieties of the other apartments</s> but these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beatfeverishly the heart of life</s>  and the revel went whirlingly on until atlength there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock</s>  and thenthe music ceased as i have told and the evolutions of the waltzerswere quieted and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before</s> but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of theclock and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept withmore of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those whorevelled</s>  and thus too it happened perhaps that before the lastechoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were manyindividuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of thepresence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of nosingle individual before</s>  and the rumor of this new presence havingspread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from thewhole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation andsurprisethen finally of terror of horror and of disgust</s> in an assembly of phantasms such as i have painted it may well besupposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation</s> in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited butthe figure in question had outheroded herod and gone beyond the boundsof even the princes indefinite decorum</s>  there are chords in the heartsof the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion</s>  even withthe utterly lost to whom life and death are equally jests there arematters of which no jest can be made</s>  the whole company indeed seemednow deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the strangerneither wit nor propriety existed</s>  the figure was tall and gaunt andshrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave</s>  themask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble thecountenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must havehad difficulty in detecting the cheat</s>  and yet all this might have beenendured if not approved by the mad revellers around</s>  but the mummerhad gone so far as to assume the type of the red death</s>  his vesture wasdabbled in bloodand his broad brow with all the features of the facewas besprinkled with the scarlet horror</s> when the eyes of prince prospero fell upon this spectral image whichwith a slow and solemn movement as if more fully to sustain its rolestalked to and fro among the waltzers he was seen to be convulsed inthe first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distastebut in the next his brow reddened with rage</s> who dares</s>  he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood nearhimwho dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery</s>  seize him andunmask himthat we may know whom we have to hang at sunrise from thebattlements</s> it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the prince prosperoas he uttered these words</s>  they rang throughout the seven rooms loudlyand clearlyfor the prince was a bold and robust man and the music hadbecome hushed at the waving of his hand</s> it was in the blue room where stood the prince with a group of palecourtiers by his side</s>  at first as he spoke there was a slight rushingmovement of this group in the direction of the intruder who at themoment was also near at hand and now with deliberate and stately stepmade closer approach to the speaker</s>  but from a certain nameless awewith which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the wholeparty there were found none who put forth hand to seize him so thatunimpeded he passed within a yard of the princes person and whilethe vast assembly as if with one impulse shrank from the centres ofthe rooms to the walls he made his way uninterruptedly but with thesame solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from thefirst through the blue chamber to the purplethrough the purple tothe greenthrough the green to the orangethrough this again to thewhiteand even thence to the violet ere a decided movement had beenmade to arrest him</s>  it was then however that the prince prosperomaddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice rushedhurriedly through the six chambers while none followed him on accountof a deadly terror that had seized upon all</s>  he bore aloft a drawndagger and had approached in rapid impetuosity to within three orfour feet of the retreating figure when the latter having attained theextremity of the velvet apartment turned suddenly and confronted hispursuer</s>  there was a sharp cryand the dagger dropped gleaming upon thesable carpet upon which instantly afterwards fell prostrate in deaththe prince prospero</s>  then summoning the wild courage of despaira throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the blackapartment and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect andmotionless within the shadow of the ebony clock gasped in unutterablehorror at finding the gravecerements and corpselike mask which theyhandled with so violent a rudeness untenanted by any tangible form</s> and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death</s>  he had comelike a thief in the night</s>  and one by one dropped the revellers in thebloodbedewed halls of their revel and died each in the despairingposture of his fall</s>  and the life of the ebony clock went out withthat of the last of the gay</s>  and the flames of the tripods expired</s>  anddarkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion

seemed to have been constructed for no especial usein itself but formed merely the interval between two of the colossalsupports of the roof of the catacombs and was backed by one of

breathed more freely</s>  it seemed evidentthat mine was not at least the most hideous of fates</s> and now as i still continued to step cautiously onward there camethronging upon my recollection a

at the rag</s>  there were in all then a hundredpaces and admitting two paces to the yard i presumed the dungeon tobe fifty yards in circuit</s>  i had met however with many angles in thewall and thus

them</s>  quitting the wall i resolvedto cross the area of the enclosure</s>  at first i proceeded with extremecaution for the floor although seemingly of solid material wastreacherous with slime</s>  at length however i took courage and did nothesitate to step firmly endeavoring to cross in as direct a line aspossible</s>  i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner whenthe remnant of

mynostrils</s>  i put forward my arm and shuddered to find that i had fallenat the very brink of a circular pit whose extent of course i hadno means of ascertaining at the moment</s>  groping about the masonry justbelow the margin i succeeded in dislodging a small fragment and let itfall into the abyss</s>  for many seconds i hearkened to its reverberationsas it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent at lengththere was a sullen plunge into water succeeded by loud echoes</s>  at thesame moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening and asrapid closing of a door overhead while a faint gleam of light flashedsuddenly through the gloom and as suddenly faded away</s> i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me and congratulatedmyself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped</s>  another stepbefore my fall and the world had seen me no more</s>  and the death justavoided was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous

had been reserved forthe latter</s>  by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung until itrembled at the sound of my own voice and had become in every respect afitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me</s> shaking in every limb i groped my way back to the wall resolvingthere to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells of which myimagination now pictured many in

greatly mistaken</s>  the whole circuit of its wallsdid not exceed twentyfive yards</s>  for some minutes this fact occasionedme a world of vain trouble vain indeed</s>  for what could be of lessimportance under the terrible circumstances which environed me thenthe mere dimensions of my dungeon</s>  but my soul took a wild interest intrifles and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i hadcommitted in my measurement</s>  the truth at length flashed upon me</s>  in myfirst attempt at exploration i had counted fiftytwo paces up to theperiod when i fell i must then have been within a pace or two of thefragment of serge in fact i had nearly performed the circuit of thevault</s>  i then slept and upon awaking i must have returned upon mystepsthus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was</s>  myconfusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour withthe wall to the left and ended it with the wall to the right</s> i had been deceived too in respect to the shape of the enclosure</s> in feeling my way i had found many angles and thus deduced an idea ofgreat irregularity so potent is the effect of total darkness upon onearousing from lethargy or sleep</s>  the angles were simply those of a fewslight depressions or niches at odd intervals</s>  the general shape ofthe prison was square</s>  what i had taken for masonry seemed now to beiron or some other metal in huge plates whose sutures or jointsoccasioned the depression</s>  the entire surface of this metallic enclosurewas rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which thecharnel superstition of the monks has given rise</s>  the figures of fiendsin aspects of menace with skeleton forms and other more reallyfearful images overspread and disfigured the walls</s>  i observed that theoutlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct but thatthe colors seemed faded and blurred as if from the effects of a dampatmosphere</s>  i now noticed the floor too which was of stone</s>  in thecentre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped but it wasthe only one in the dungeon</s> all this i saw indistinctly and by much effort for my personalcondition had been greatly changed during slumber</s>  i now lay upon myback and at full length on a species of low framework of wood</s>  to thisi was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle</s>  it passedin many convolutions about my limbs and body leaving at liberty onlymy head and my left arm to such extent that i could by dint of muchexertion supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay bymy side on the floor</s>  i saw to my horror that the pitcher had beenremoved</s>  i say to my horror for i was consumed with intolerable thirst</s> this thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulatefor the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned</s> looking upward i surveyed the ceiling of my prison</s>  it was some thirtyor forty feet overhead and constructed much as the side walls</s>  in oneof its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention</s>  it wasthe painted figure of time as he is commonly represented save that inlieu of a scythe he held what at a casual glance i supposed to bethe pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks</s> there was something however in the appearance of this machine whichcaused me to regard it more attentively</s>  while i gazed directly upwardat it for its position was immediately over my own i fancied that isaw it in motion</s>  in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed</s>  itssweep was brief and of course slow</s>  i watched it for some minutessomewhat in fear but more in wonder</s>  wearied at length with observingits dull movement i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell</s> a slight noise attracted my notice and looking to the floor i sawseveral enormous rats traversing it</s>  they had issued from the wellwhich lay just within view to my right</s>  even then while i gazed theycame up in troops hurriedly with ravenous eyes allured by the scentof the meat</s>  from this it required much effort and attention to scarethem away</s> it might have been half an hour perhaps even an hour for i could takebut imperfect note of time before i again cast my eyes upward</s>  whati then saw confounded and amazed me</s>  the sweep of the pendulum hadincreased in extent by nearly a yard</s>  as a natural consequence itsvelocity was also much greater</s>  but what mainly disturbed me was theidea that had perceptibly descended</s>  i now observedwith what horror itis needless to saythat its nether extremity was formed of a crescentof glittering steel about a foot in length from horn to horn the hornsupward and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor</s>  likea razor also it seemed massy and heavy tapering from the edge intoa solid and broad structure above</s>  it was appended to a weighty rod ofbrass and the whole hissed as it swung through the air</s> i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity intorture</s>  my cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorialagentsthe pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusantas myselfthe pit typical of hell and regarded by rumor as the ultimathule of all their punishments</s>  the plunge into this pit i had avoidedby the merest of accidents i knew that surprise or entrapment intotorment formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of thesedungeon deaths</s>  having failed to fall it was no part of the demonplan to hurl me into the abyss and thus there being no alternative adifferent and a milder destruction awaited me</s>  milder</s>  i half smiled inmy agony as i thought of such application of such a term</s> what boots it to tell of the long long hours of horror more thanmortal during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the steel</s>  inchby inchline by linewith a descent only appreciable at intervals thatseemed agesdown and still down it came</s>  days passedit might havebeen that many days passedere it swept so closely over me as to fan mewith its acrid breath</s>  the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into mynostrils</s>  i prayedi wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedydescent</s>  i grew frantically mad and struggled to force myself upwardagainst the sweep of the fearful scimitar</s>  and then i fell suddenlycalm and lay smiling at the glittering death as a child at some rarebauble</s> there was another interval of utter insensibility it was brief forupon again lapsing into life there had been no perceptible descent inthe pendulum</s>  but it might have been long for i knew there were demonswho took note of my swoon and who could have arrested the vibration atpleasure</s>  upon my recovery too i felt veryoh inexpressibly sickand weak as if through long inanition</s>  even amid the agonies of thatperiod the human nature craved food</s>  with painful effort i outstretchedmy left arm as far as my bonds permitted and took possession of thesmall remnant which had been spared me by the rats</s>  as i put a portionof it within my lips there rushed to my mind a half formed thought ofjoyof hope</s>  yet what business had i with hope</s>  it was as i say ahalf formed thoughtman has many such which are never completed</s>  i feltthat it was of joyof hope but felt also that it had perished in itsformation</s>  in vain i struggled to perfectto regain it</s>  long sufferinghad nearly annihilated all my

thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitiveintention of nature would have so arranged the earths surface as tohave fulfilled at all points mans sense of perfection in the

fact little remarkable for notwithstanding a nobledescent mine was one of those everyday appellations which seem byprescriptive right to have been time out of mind the common propertyof the mob</s>  in this narrative i have therefore designated myself aswilliam wilsona fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real</s> my namesake alone of those who in school phraseology constituted ourset presumed to compete with me in the studies of the classin thesports and broils of the playgroundto refuse implicit belief in myassertions and submission to my willindeed to interfere with myarbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever</s>  if there is on earth asupreme and unqualified despotism it is the despotism of a master mindin boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions</s> wilsons rebellion was to me a source of the greatestembarrassmentthe more so as in spite of the bravado with which inpublic i made a point of treating him and his pretensions i secretlyfelt that i feared him and could not help thinking the equality whichhe maintained so easily with myself a proof of his true superioritysince not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle</s>  yet thissuperiorityeven this equalitywas in truth acknowledged by no one butmyself our associates by some unaccountable blindness seemed not evento suspect it</s>  indeed his competition his resistance and especiallyhis impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes were not morepointed than private</s>  he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambitionwhich urged and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me toexcel</s>  in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by awhimsical desire to thwart astonish or mortify myself although therewere times when i could not help observing with a feeling made up ofwonder abasement and pique that he mingled with his injuries hisinsults or his contradictions a certain most inappropriate andassuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner</s>  i could onlyconceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate selfconceitassuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection</s> perhaps it was this latter trait in wilsons conduct conjoined with ouridentity of name and the mere accident of our having entered the schoolupon the same day which set afloat the notion that we were brothersamong the senior classes in the academy</s>  these do not usually inquirewith much strictness into the affairs of their juniors</s>  i have beforesaid or should have said that wilson was not in the most remotedegree connected with my family</s>  but assuredly if we had been brotherswe must have been twins for after leaving dr</s>  bransbys i casuallylearned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of january1813and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence for the day isprecisely that of my own nativity</s> it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned meby the rivalry of wilson and his intolerable spirit of contradictioni could not bring myself to hate him altogether</s>  we had to be surenearly every day a quarrel in which yielding me publicly the palm ofvictory he in some manner contrived to make me feel that it was hewho had deserved it yet a sense of pride on my part and a veritabledignity on his own kept us always upon what are called speakingterms while there were many points of strong congeniality in ourtempers operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position aloneperhaps prevented from ripening into friendship</s>  it is difficultindeed to define or even to describe my real feelings towardshim</s>  they formed a motley and heterogeneous admixturesome petulantanimosity which was not yet hatred some esteem more respect muchfear with a world of uneasy curiosity</s>  to the moralist it will beunnecessary to say in addition that wilson and myself were the mostinseparable of companions</s> it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between uswhich turned all my attacks upon him and they were many either openor covert into the channel of banter or practical joke giving painwhile assuming the aspect of mere fun rather than into a more seriousand determined hostility</s>  but my endeavours on this head were by nomeans uniformly successful even when my plans were the most wittilyconcocted for my namesake had much about him in character of thatunassuming and quiet austerity which while enjoying the poignancy ofits own jokes has no heel of achilles in itself and absolutely refusesto be laughed at</s>  i could find indeed but one vulnerable pointand that lying in a personal peculiarity arising perhaps fromconstitutional disease would have been spared by any antagonist lessat his wits end than myselfmy rival had a weakness in the faucal orguttural organs which precluded him from raising his voice at any timeabove a very low whisper</s>  of this defect i did not fall to take whatpoor advantage lay in my power</s> wilsons retaliations in kind were many and there was one form of hispractical wit that disturbed me beyond measure</s>  how his sagacity firstdiscovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me is a question inever could solve but having discovered he habitually practised theannoyance</s>  i had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic andits very common if not plebeian praenomen</s>  the words were venom in myears and when upon the day of my arrival a second william wilson camealso to the academy i felt angry with him for bearing the name anddoubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it who wouldbe the cause of its twofold repetition who would be constantly in mypresence and whose concerns in the ordinary routine of the schoolbusiness must inevitably on account of the detestable coincidence beoften confounded with my own</s> the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with everycircumstance tending to show resemblance moral or physical between myrival and myself</s>  i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that wewere of the same age but i saw that we were of the same height andi perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour ofperson and outline of feature</s>  i was galled too by the rumor touchinga relationship which had grown current in the upper forms</s>  in a wordnothing could more seriously disturb me although i scrupulouslyconcealed such disturbance than any allusion to a similarity of mindperson or condition existing between us</s>  but in truth i had no reasonto believe that with the exception of the matter of relationship andin the case of wilson himself this similarity had ever been made asubject of comment or even observed at all by our schoolfellows</s>  thathe observed it in all its bearings and as fixedly as i was apparentbut that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field ofannoyance can only be attributed as i said before to his more thanordinary penetration</s> his cue which was to perfect an imitation of myself lay both in wordsand in actions and most admirably did he play his part</s>  my dress itwas an easy matter to copy my gait and general manner were withoutdifficulty appropriated in spite of his constitutional defect even myvoice did not escape him</s>  my louder tones were of course unattemptedbut then the key it was identical and his singular whisper it grewthe very echo of my own</s> how greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me for it couldnot justly be termed a caricature i will not now venture to describe</s> i had but one consolationin the fact that the imitation apparentlywas noticed by myself alone and that i had to endure only the knowingand strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself</s>  satisfied withhaving produced in my bosom the intended effect he seemed to chucklein secret over the sting he had inflicted and was characteristicallydisregardful of the public applause which the success of his wittyendeavours might have so easily elicited</s>  that the school indeed didnot feel his design perceive its accomplishment and participate inhis sneer was for many anxious months a riddle i could notresolve</s>  perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readilyperceptible or more possibly i owed my security to the master air ofthe copyist who disdaining the letter which in a painting is allthe obtuse can see gave but the full spirit of his original for myindividual contemplation and chagrin</s> i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronagewhich he assumed toward me and of his frequent officious interferencewith my will</s>  this interference often took the ungracious character ofadvice advice not openly given but hinted or insinuated</s>  i received itwith a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years</s>  yet at thisdistant day let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i canrecall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the sideof those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeminginexperience that his moral sense at least if not his general talentsand worldly wisdom was far keener than my own and that i mighttoday have been a better and thus a happier man had i lessfrequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whisperswhich i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised</s> as it was i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distastefulsupervision and daily resented more and more openly what i consideredhis intolerable arrogance</s>  i have said that in the first years of ourconnexion as schoolmates my feelings in regard to him might havebeen easily ripened into friendship but in the latter months of myresidence at the academy although the intrusion of his ordinary mannerhad beyond doubt in some measure abated my sentiments in nearlysimilar proportion partook very much of positive hatred</s>  upon oneoccasion he saw this i think and afterwards avoided or made a show ofavoiding me</s> it was about the same period if i remember aright that in analtercation of violence with him in which he was more than usuallythrown off his guard and spoke and acted with an openness of demeanorrather foreign to his nature i discovered or fancied i discoveredin his accent his air and general appearance a something which firststartled and then deeply interested me by bringing to mind dim visionsof my earliest infancywild confused and thronging memories of atime when memory herself was yet unborn</s>  i cannot better describe thesensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficultyshake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being whostood before me at some epoch very long agosome point of the pasteven infinitely remote</s>  the delusion however faded rapidly as it cameand i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation ithere held with my singular

fifth year at the school andimmediately after the altercation just mentioned finding every onewrapped in sleep i arose from bed and lamp in hand stole through awilderness of narrow passages from my

devious ways into its channel as well as the spaces thatextended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams untilthey reached the bed of pebbles at the bottomthese spots not lessthan

with the yellow buttercup the white daisy the purpleviolet and the rubyred asphodel that its exceeding beauty spoke toour hearts in loud tones of the love and of the glory of god</s> and here and there in groves about this grass like wildernesses ofdreams sprang up fantastic trees whose tall slender stems stood notupright but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at noondayinto the centre of the valley</s>  their mark was speckled with the vividalternate splendor of ebony and silver and was smoother than all savethe cheeks of eleonora so that but for the brilliant green of the

crimson and gold and settling in peace above us sank dayby day lower and lower until its edges rested upon the tops of themountains turning all their dimness into magnificence and shutting usup as if forever within a magic prisonhouse of grandeur and of glory</s> the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim but she was amaiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among theflowers</s>  no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heartand she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked togetherin the valley of the manycolored grass and discoursed of the mightychanges which had lately taken place therein</s> at length having spoken one day in tears of the last sad changewhich must befall humanity she thenceforward dwelt only upon this onesorrowful

finger of death was upon her bosomthat like theephemeron she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die butthe terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which sherevealed to me

the love which now was so passionately her own to somemaiden of the outer and everyday world</s>  and then and there i threwmyself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora and offered up a vow toherself and to heaven that i would never bind myself in marriage to anydaughter of earththat i would in no manner prove recreant to her dearmemory or to the memory of the devout affection with which she hadblessed me</s>  and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness thepious solemnity of my vow</s>  and the curse which i invoked of him andof her a saint in helusion should i prove

sighed as if a deadly burthen had beentaken from her breast and she trembled and very bitterly wept but shemade acceptance of the vow for what was she but a child</s>  and it madeeasy to her the bed of her death</s>  and she said to me not many daysafterward tranquilly dying that because of what i had done forthe comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit whendeparted and if so
