eliminate and destroy itshould by americans be summarily rejected</s> the question of supreme interest to us therefore is whether thesocial order implied in the british program is mainly in the nature

 it is based on what isknown as modern social science which has as its ultimate sanction thenature of the human mind as revealed by psychology</s>  a consideration ofthe principles underlying this

by spiritualizing human effort aims to achieve</s>  we may findthat the appearance of such a program as that of the british labourparty supported as it is by an imposing proportion of the populationof

education which we have inherited from thepast largely fails to accomplish this</s>  in the first place it has beenauthoritative rather than scientific which is to say that students havebeen induced to accept the statements of teachers and text books andhave not been trained to weigh for themselves their reasonableness andworth a principle essentially unscientific and undemocratic since

 the german system which has been bent uponinstalling authoritative conviction instead of encouraging freedom ofthought should be a warning to us</s> again outside of the realm of physical science our text books havebeen controversial rather than impartial especially in economics andhistory resulting in erroneous and distorted and prejudiced ideas ofevents such for instance as our american

view of discovering the peculiar bent and this bentis guided and encouraged</s>  the child is allowed to forge ahead in thosesubjects for which he shows an aptitude and not compelled to wait on

is true howeverthat the trained and gifted teacher is able to discover a method of sopresenting a subject as to seize the imagination and arouse the interestand industry of a majority of pupils</s>  in the modern schools french forexample is really taught pupils do not acquire a mere smatteringof the language</s>  and what is more important the course of study isdirectly related to life and to practical experience instead of beingset forth abstractly as something which at the time the pupil perceivesno possibility of putting into use</s>  at one of the new schools in thesouth the ignorant

this idea is essentially anelement of the democratic contention that all citizens must be givenan equality of opportunitythough all may not be created equalnowbecoming a positive rather than a
