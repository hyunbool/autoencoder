 he saw her once and in the glance a moments glance of meeting eyes his heart stood still in sudden trance he trembled with a sweet surprise all in the waning light she stood the star of perfect womanhood</s>  that summereve his heart was light with lighter step he trod the ground and life was fairer in his sight and music was in every sound he blessed the world where there could be so beautiful a thing as she</s>  there once again as evening fell and stars were peering overhead two lovers met to bid farewell the western sun gleamed faint and red lost in a drift of purple cloud that wrapped him like a funeralshroud</s>  long time the memory of that night the hand that clasped the lips that kissed the form that faded from his sight slow sinking through the tearful mist in dreamy music seemed to roll through the dark chambers of his soul</s>  so after many years he came a wanderer from a distant shore the street the house were still the same but those he sought were there no more his burning words his hopes and fears unheeded fell on alien ears</s>  only the children from their play would pause the mournful tale to hear shrinking in halfalarm away or step by step would venture near to touch with timid curious hands that strange wild man from other lands</s>  he sat beside the busy street there where he last had seen her face and thronging memories bittersweet seemed yet to haunt the ancient place her footfall ever floated near her voice was ever in his ear</s>  he sometimes as the daylight waned and evening mists began to roll in halfsoliloquy complained of that black shadow on his soul and blindly fanned with cruel care the ashes of a vain despair</s>  the summer fled the lonely man still lingered out the lessening days still as the night drew on would scan each passing face with closer gaze till sick at heart he turned away and sighed she will not come today</s>  so by degrees his spirit bent to mock its own despairing cry in stern selftorture to invent new luxuries of agony and people all the vacant space with visions of her perfect face</s>  then for a moment she was nigh he heard no step but she was there as if an angel suddenly were bodied from the viewless air and all her fine ethereal frame should fade as swiftly as it came</s>  so half in fancys sunny trance and half in miserys aching void with set and stony countenance his bitter being he enjoyed and thrust for ever from his mind the happiness he could not find</s>  as when the wretch in lonely room to selfish death is madly hurled the glamour of that fatal fume shuts out the wholesome living world so all his manhoods strength and pride one sickly dream had swept aside</s>  yea brother and we passed him there but yesterday in merry mood and marveled at the lordly air that shamed his beggars attitude nor heeded that ourselves might be wretches as desperate as he who let the thought of bliss denied make havoc of our life and powers and pine in solitary pride for peace that never shall be ours because we will not work and wait in trustful patience for our fate</s>  and so it chanced once more that she came by the old familiar spot the face he would have died to see bent oer him and he knew it not too rapt in selfish grief to hear even when happiness was near</s>  and pity filled her gentle breast for him that would not stir nor speak the dying crimson of the west that faintly tinged his haggard cheek fell on her as she stood and shed a glory round the patient head</s>  ah let him wake</s>  the moments fly this awful tryst may be the last</s>  and see the tear that dimmed her eye had fallen on him ere she passed she passed the crimson paled to gray and hope departed with the day</s>  the heavy hours of night went by and silence quickened into sound and light slid up the eastern sky and life began its daily round but light and life for him were fled his name was numbered with the dead</s> nov</s>  1861</s> illustrationthe path of roses</s>  in the dark silence of an ancient room whose one tall window fronted to the west where through laced tendrils of a hanging vine the sunsetglow was fading into night sat a pale lady resting weary hands upon a great clasped volume and her face within her hands</s>  not as in rest she bowed but large hot tears were coursing down her cheek and her lowpanted sobs broke awefully upon the sleeping echoes of the night</s>  soon she unclaspd the volume once again and read the words in tone of agony as in selftorture weeping as she read he crowns the glory of his race he prayeth but in some fit place to meet his foeman face to face and battling for the true the right from ruddy dawn to purple night to perish in the midmost fight where hearts are fierce and hands are strong where peals the bugle loud and long where blood is dropping in the throng still with a dim and glazing eye to watch the tide of victory to hear in death the battlecry then gathered grandly to his grave to rest among the true and brave in holy ground where yewtrees wave where from churchwindows sculptured fair float out upon the evening air the note of praise the voice of prayer where no vain marble mockery insults with loud and boastful lie the simple soldiers memory where sometimes little children go and read in whisperd accent slow the name of him who sleeps below</s>  her voice died out like one in dreams she sat</s>  alas</s>  she sighed</s>  for what can woman do</s>  her life is aimless and her death unknown hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain</s>  man has his work but what can woman do</s>  and answer came there from the creeping gloom the creeping gloom that settled into night peace</s>  for thy lot is other than a mans his is a path of thorns he beats them down he faces death he wrestles with despair</s>  thine is of roses to adorn and cheer his lonely life and hide the thorns in flowers</s>  she spake again in bitter tone she spake aye as a toy the puppet of an hour or a fair posy newly plucked at morn but flung aside and withered ere the night</s>  and answer came there from the creeping gloom the creeping gloom that blackened into night so shalt thou be the lamp to light his path what time the shades of sorrow close around</s>  and so it seemed to her an awful light pierced slowly through the darkness orbed and grew until all passed awaythe ancient room the sunlight dying through the trellised vine the one tall windowall had passed away and she was standing on the mighty hills</s>  beneath around and far as eye could see squadron on squadron stretched opposing hosts ranked as for battle mute and motionless</s>  anon a distant thunder shook the ground the tramp of horses and a troop shot by plunged headlong in that living sea of men plunged to their death back from that fatal field a scattered handful fighting hard for life broke through the serried lines but as she gazed they shrank and melted and their forms grew thin grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray dawns from the eastthe trumpets brazen blare died into silenceand the vision passed passed to a room where sick and dying lay in long sad linethere brooded fear and pain darkness was there the shade of azraels wing</s>  but there was one that ever to and fro moved with light footfall purely calm her face and those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom still as she went she ministered to each comfort and counsel cooled the fevered brow with softest touch and in the listening ear of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace</s>  the dying warrior gazing as she passed clasped his thin hands and blessed her</s>  bless her too thou who didst bless the merciful of old</s>  so prayed the lady watching tearfully her gentle moving onward till the night had veiled her wholly and the vision passed</s>  then once again the solemn whisper came so in the darkest path of mans despair where war and terror shake the troubled earth lies womans mission with unblenching brow to pass through scenes of horror and affright where men grow sick and tremble unto her all things are sanctified for all are good</s>
 nothing so mean but shall deserve her care nothing so great but she may bear her part</s>  no life is vain each hath his place assigned do thou thy task and leave the rest to god</s>  and there was silence but the lady made no answer save one deeplybreathed amen</s>  and she arose and in that darkening room stood lonely as a spirit of the night stood calm and fearless in the gathered night and raised her eyes to heaven</s>  there were tears upon her face but in her heart was peace peace that the world nor gives nor takes away</s> april 10 1856</s> illustrationthe valley of the shadow of death</s>  hark said the dying man and sighed to that complaining tone like sprite condemned each eventide to walk the world alone</s>  at sunset when the air is still i hear it creep from yonder hill it breathes upon me dead and chill a moment and is gone</s>  my son it minds me of a day left half a life behind that i have prayed to put away for ever from my mind</s>  but bitter memory will not die it haunts my soul when none is nigh i hear its whisper in the sigh of that complaining wind</s>  and now in death my soul is fain to tell the tale of fear that hidden in my breast hath lain through many a weary year yet time would fail to utter all the evil spells that held me thrall and thrust my life from fall to fall thou needest not to hear</s>  the spells that bound me with a chain sins stern behests to do till pleasures self invoked in vain a heavy burden grew till from my spirits fevered eye a hunted thing i seemed to fly through the dark woods that underlie yon mountainrange of blue</s>  deep in those woods i found a vale no sunlight visiteth nor star nor wandering moonbeam pale where never comes the breath of summerbreezethere in mine ear even as i lingered half in fear i heard a whisper cold and clear this is the gate of death</s>  o bitter is it to abide in weariness alway at dawn to sigh for eventide at eventide for day</s>  thy noon hath fled thy sun hath shone</s>  the brightness of thy day is gone what need to lag and linger on till life be cold and gray</s>  o well it said beneath yon pool in some still cavern deep the fevered brain might slumber cool the eyes forget to weep within that goblets mystic rim are draughts of healing stored for him whose heart is sick whose sight is dim who prayeth but to sleep</s>  the eveningbreeze went moaning by like mourner for the dead and stirred with shrill complaining sigh the treetops overhead my guardianangel seemed to stand and mutely wave a warning hand with sudden terror all unmanned i turned myself and fled</s>  a cottagegate stood open wide soft fell the dying ray on two fair children side by side that rested from their play together bent the earnest head as ever and anon they read from one dear book the words they said come back to me today</s>  like twin cascades on mountainstair together wandered down the ripples of the golden hair the ripples of the brown while through the tangled silken haze blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze more starlike than the gems that blaze about a monarchs crown</s>  my son there comes to each an hour when sinks the spirits pride when weary hands forget their power the strokes of death to guide in such a moment warriors say a word the panicrout may stay a sudden charge redeem the day and turn the living tide</s>  i could not see for blinding tears the glories of the west a heavenly music filled mine ears a heavenly peace my breast</s>  come unto me come unto me all ye that labour unto me ye heavyladen come to me and i will give you rest</s>  the night drew onward thin and blue the evening mists arise to bathe the thirsty land in dew as erst in paradise while over silent field and town the deep blue vault of heaven looked down not as of old in angry frown but bright with angels eyes</s>  blest day</s>  then first i heard the voice that since hath oft beguiled these eyes from tears and bid rejoice this heart with anguish wild thy mother boy thou hast not known so soon she left me here to moan left me to weep and watch alone our one beloved child</s>  though parted from my aching sight like homewardspeeding dove she passed into the perfect light that floods the world above yet our twin spirits well i know though one abide in pain below love as in summers long ago and evermore shall love</s>  so with a glad and patient heart i move toward mine end the streams that flow awhile apart shall both in ocean blend</s>  i dare not weep i can but bless the love that pitied my distress and lent me in lifes wilderness so sweet and true a friend</s>  but if there beo if there be a truth in what they say that angelforms we cannot see go with us on our way then surely she is with me here i dimly feel her spirit near the morningmists grow thin and clear and death brings in the day</s> april 1868</s> illustrationsolitude</s>  i love the stillness of the wood i love the music of the rill i love to couch in pensive mood  upon some silent hill</s>  scarce heard beneath yon arching trees the silvercrested ripples pass and like a mimic brook the breeze  whispers among the grass</s>  here from the world i win release nor scorn of men nor footstep rude break in to mar the holy peace  of this great solitude</s>  here may the silent tears i weep lull the vexed spirit into rest as infants sob themselves to sleep  upon a mothers breast</s>  but when the bitter hour is gone and the keen throbbing pangs are still oh sweetest then to couch alone  upon some silent hill</s>  to live in joys that once have been to put the cold world out of sight and deck lifes drear and barren scene  with hues of rainbowlight</s>  for what to man the gift of breath if sorrow be his lot below if all the day that ends in death  be dark with clouds of woe</s>  shall the poor transport of an hour repay long years of sore distress the fragrance of a lonely flower  make glad the wilderness</s>  ye golden hours of lifes young spring of innocence of love and truth</s>  bright beyond all imagining  thou fairydream of youth</s>  id give all wealth that years have piled the slow result of lifes decay to be once more a little child  for one bright summerday</s> march 16 1853</s>

sweet maids arise whose life was of yesterday of a beatrice pale and stern with the lips of a dumb despair with the innocent eyes that yearn yearn for the young sweet hours of life far from sorrow and far from strife for the happy summers that never return when the world seemed good and fair of a beatrice glorious bright of a sainted ethereal maid whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light cheering the poet that broodeth apart filling with gladness his desolate heart like the moon when she shines thro a cloudless night on a world of silence and shade</s>  and the visions waver and faint and the visions vanish away that my fancy delighted to paint she is here at my side a living child with the glowing cheek and the tresses wild nor deathpale martyr nor radiant saint yet stainless and

would all forget his dream of the feast and crouch at her feet a slave</s>  she would twine her hand in his mane she would prattle in silvery tone like the tinkle of summerrain questioning him with her laughing eyes questioning him with a glad surprise till she caught from those fierce eyes again the love that lit her own</s>  and be sure if a savage heart in a mask of human guise were to come on her here apart bound for a dark and a deadly deed hurrying past with pitiless speed he would suddenly falter and guiltily start at the glance of her pure blue eyes</s>  nay be sure if an angel fair a bright seraph undefiled were to stoop from the trackless air fain would she linger in glad amaze lovingly linger to ponder and gaze with a sisters love and a sisters care on the happy innocent

with many a fruit  the grass with many a flower my soul was dead my tongue was mute  in that accursd hour</s>  and in my dream with silvery voice  she said or seemed to say youth is the season to

cried my heart to thee</s>  the very heart from out my breast i plucked i gave it willingly her very heart she gave to me then died the glory from the west</s>  in the gray light i saw her face and it was withered old and gray the flowers were fading in their place were fading with the fading day</s>  forth from her like a hunted deer through all that ghastly night i fled and still behind me seemed to hear  her fierce unflagging tread and scarce drew breath for fear</s>  yet marked i well how strangely seemed the heart within my breast to sleep silent it lay or so i dreamed  with never a throb or leap</s>  for hers was now my heart she said the heart that once had been mine own and in my breast i bore instead  a cold cold heart of stone</s>  so grew the morning overhead</s>  the sun shot
