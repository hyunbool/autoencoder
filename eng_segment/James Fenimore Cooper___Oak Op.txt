insects toward their hives but they could notunderstand the virtue of the angle</s>  the first bore so strong anaffinity to their own pursuit of game as to be very obvious totheir senses but the last

stand farther back inorder to give him a fair chance and just as he had done so thebee rose</s>  after humming around the stump for an instant away theinsect flew taking a course almost at right angles to that in whichle bourdon had expected to see it fly</s>  it required half a minute forhim to recollect that this little creature had gone off in a linenearly parallel to that which had been taken by the second of thebees which he had seen quit his original position</s>  the line ledacross the neighboring prairie and any attempt to follow these beeswas hopeless</s> but the second creature was also soon ready and when it dartedaway le bourdon to his manifest delight saw that it held itsflight toward the point of the swamp into or over which two of hisfirst captives had gone</s>  this settled the doubtful matter</s>  had thehive of these bees been beyond that wood the angle of intersectionwould not have been there but at the hive across the prairie</s>  thereader will understand that creatures which obey an instinct orsuch a reason as bees possess would never make a curvature in theirflights without some strong motive for it</s>  thus two bees taken fromflowers that stood half a mile apart would be certain not to crosseach others tracks in returning home until they met at the commonhive and wherever the intersecting angle in their respectiveflights may be there would that hive be also</s>  as this repository ofsweets was the game le bourdon had in view it is easy to see howmuch he was pleased when the direction taken by the last of his beesgave him the necessary

defect that exists within</s>  then somespecies of wood are more frequented by the bees than others whilethe instinct of the industrious little creatures generally enablesthem to select such homes as will not be very likely to destroy allthe fruits of their industry by an untimely fall</s>  in all theseparticulars both bees and beehunter were well versed and ben madehis search accordingly</s> among the other implements of his calling le bourdon had a smallspyglass one scarcely larger than those that are used in theatresbut which was powerful and every way suited to its purposes</s>  ben wasnot long in selecting a tree a halfdecayed elm as the one likelyto contain the hive and by the aid of his glass he soon saw beesflying among its dying branches at a height of not less thanseventy feet from the ground</s>  a little further search directed hisattention to a knothole in and out of which the glass enabled himto see bees passing in streams</s>  this decided the point and

the richness of the prize while benhimself and gershom manifested most satisfaction at the amount ofthe earnings</s>  when the tree was cut in pieces and split it wasascertained that years of sweets were contained within its capaciouscavities and ben estimated the portion that fell to his share atmore than three hundred pounds of good honeycomb includedafterdeducting the portions that were given

from whiskey centre i do not expectto learn much i will own but i am mistaken if the pigeonswinghere has not a message that will make us all open our ears</s> the indians ejaculated their assent but gershom was a man who couldnot express anything sententiously</s>  as the beehunter led the waytoward his cabin or shanty he made his comments with his customaryfreedom</s>  before recording what he communicated however we shalldigress for one moment in order to say a word ourselves concerningthis term shanty</s>  it is now in general use throughout the whole ofthe united states meaning a cabin that has been constructed inhaste and for temporary purposes</s>  by a license of speech it isoccasionally applied to more permanent residences as men are knownto apply familiar epithets to familiar objects</s>  the derivation ofthe word has caused some speculation</s>  the term certainly came fromthe westperhaps from the northwestand the best explanation we haveever heard of its derivation is to suppose shanty as we nowspell it a corruption of chiente which it is thought may havebeen a word in canadian french phrase to express a dogkennel</s> chenil we believe is the true french term for such a thing andour own word is said to be derived from itmeute meaning akennel of dogs or a pack of hounds rather than their dwelling</s> at any rate chiente is so plausible a solution of the difficultythat one may hope it is the true one even though he has no betterauthority for it than a very vague rumor</s>  curious discoveries aresometimes made by these rude analogies however though they aregenerally thought not to be very near akin to learning</s>  forourselves now we do not entertain a doubt that the sobriquet ofyankees which is in every mans mouth and of which the derivationappears to puzzle all our philologists is nothing but a slightcorruption of the word yengeese the term applied to theenglish by the tribes to whom they first became known</s>  we have noother authority for this derivation than conjecture and conjecturesthat are purely our own but it is so very plausible as almost tocarry conviction of itself</s>  footnote since writing the above theauthor has met with an allusion that has induced him to think he maynot have been the first to suggest this derivation of the wordyankee</s>  with himself the suggestion is perfectly original andhas long since been published by him but nothing is more probablethan the fact that a solution so very natural of this longdisputedquestion in language may have suggested itself to various minds</s> the chiente or shanty of le bourdon stood quite near to the banksof the kalamazoo and in a most beautiful grove of the burroak</s>  benhad selected the site with much taste though the proximity of aspring of delicious water had probably its full share in influencinghis decision</s>  it was necessary moreover that he should be near theriver as his great movements were all made by water for theconvenience of transporting his tools furniture etc</s>  as well ashis honey</s>  a famous bark canoe lay in a little bay out of thecurrent of the stream securely moored head and stern in order toprevent her beating against any object harder than herself</s> the dwelling had been constructed with some attention to security</s> this was rendered necessary in some measure as ben had found byexperience on account of two classes of enemiesmen and bears</s> from the first it is true the beehunter had hitherto apprehendedbut little</s>  there were few human beings in that region</s>  the northernportions of the noble peninsula of michigan are somewhat low andswampy or are too broken and savage to tempt the native huntersfrom the openings and prairies that then lay in such richprofusion further south and west</s>  with the exception of the shoresor coasts it was seldom that the northern half of the peninsulafelt the footstep of man</s>  with the southern half however it wasvery different the openings and glades and watercoursesoffering almost as many temptations to the savage as they have sincedone to the civilized man</s>  nevertheless the bison or the buffaloas the animal is erroneously but very generally termed throughoutthe country was not often found in the vast herds of which we readuntil one reached the great prairies west of the mississippi</s>  thereit was that the red men most loved to congregate though alwaysbearing in numbers but a trifling proportion to the surface theyoccupied</s>  in that day however near as to the date but distant asto the

along the banks of the stream of that name aregion that almost merits the lofty appellation of the garden ofamerica</s>  le bourdon knew many of their warriors and was muchesteemed among them though he had never met with either of thosewhom chance now had thrown in his way</s>  in general he sufferedlittle wrong from the red men who wondered at his occupation whilethey liked his character but he had sustained losses and even illtreatment from certain outcasts of the tribes as well as fromvagrant whites who occasionally found their way to his temporarydwellings</s>  on the present occasion le bourdon felt far moreuneasiness from the circumstance of having his abode known togershom waring a countryman and fellowchristian in one sense atleast than from its being known to the chippewa and thepottawattamie</s> the bears were constant and dangerous sources of annoyance to thebeehunter</s>  it was not often that an armed manand le bourdonseldom moved without his riflehas much to apprehend from thecommon brown bear of america</s>  though a formidablelooking animalespecially when full grown it is seldom bold enough to attack ahuman being nothing but hunger or care for its young

the sweetmorsels but it will scent them from afar</s>  on one occasion a familyof bruins had looked into a shanty of bens that was notconstructed with sufficient care and consummated their burglary bydemolishing the last comb</s>  that disaster almost ruined theadventurer then quite young in his calling and ever since itsoccurrence he had taken the precaution to build such a citadel asshould at least set teeth and paws at defiance</s>  to one who had anaxe with access to young pines this was not a difficult task aswas proved by the present habitation of our hero</s> this was the second season that le bourdon had occupied castlemeal as he himself called the shanty</s>  this appellation was acorruption of chateau au mtel a name given to it by a wag of avoyageur who had aided ben in ascending the kalamazoo the previoussummer and had remained long enough with him to help him put up hishabitation</s>  the building was just twelve feet square in theinterior and somewhat less than fourteen on its exterior</s>  it wasmade of pine logs in the usual mode with the additional securityof possessing a roof of squared timbers of which the several partswere so nicely fitted together as to shed rain</s>  this unusualprecaution was rendered necessary to protect the honey since thebears would have unroofed the common bark coverings of the shantieswith the readiness of human beings in order to get at stores asample as those which the beehunter had soon collected beneath hisroof</s>  there was one window of glass which le bourdon had brought inhis canoe though it was a single sash

dolly is my wife and blossom is mysister</s>  the real name of blossom is margery waring but everybodycalls her blossom and so i gin into it with the rest on em</s> it is probable that le bourdon lost a good deal of his interest inthis flower of the wilderness as soon as he learned she was sonearly related to the whiskey centre</s>  gershom was so very uninvitingan object and had so many palpable marks that he had fairly earnedthe nickname which as it afterward appeared the westernadventurers had given him as well as his abode wherever the lastmight be that no one of decently sober habits could readily fancyanything belonging to him</s>  at any rate the beehunter now led theway into his cabin whither he was followed without unnecessaryceremony by all three of his guests</s> the interior of the chiente to use the most poetical if not themost accurate word was singularly clean for an establishment set upby a bachelor in so remote a part of the world</s>  the honey in neatwellconstructed kegs was carefully piled along one side of theapartment in a way to occupy the minimum of room and to be ratherornamental than unsightly</s>  these kegs were made by le bourdonhimself who had acquired as much of the art as was necessary tothat object</s>  the woods always furnished the materials and a pile ofstaves that was placed beneath a neighboring tree sufficientlydenoted that he did not yet deem that portion of his task completed</s> in one corner of the hut was a pile of welldressed bearskins threein number each and all of which had been taken from the carcassesof fallen foes within the last two months</s>  three more werestretched on saplings near by in the process of curing</s>  it was amaterial part of the beehunters craft to kill this

sticks and abench or two together with a wooden chest of some size completedthe furniture</s>  tools were suspended from the walls it is true andno less than three rifles in addition to a very neat doublebarrelled shotgun or fowlingpiece were standing in a corner</s> these were arms collected by our hero in his different trips andretained quite as much from affection as from necessity or caution</s> of ammunition there was no very great amount visible only three orfour horns and a couple of pouches being suspended from pegs butben had a secret store as well as another rifle carefully securedin a natural magazine and arsenal at a distance sufficiently greatfrom the chiente to remove it from all danger of sharing in thefortunes of his citadel should disaster befall the last</s> the cooking was done altogether out of doors</s>  for this essentialcomfort le bourdon had made very liberal provision</s>  he had a smalloven a sufficiently convenient fireplace and a storehouse athand all placed near the spring and beneath the shade of amagnificent elm</s>  in the storehouse he kept his barrel of flour hisbarrel of salt a stock of smoked or dried meat and that which thewoodsman if accustomed in early life to the settlements prizesmost highly a halfbarrel of pickled pork</s>  the bark canoe hadsufficed to transport all these stores merely ballasting handsomelythat ticklish craft and its owner relied on the honey to performthe same office on the return voyage when trade or consumptionshould have disposed of the various articles just named</s> the reader may smile at the word trade and ask where were thoseto be found who could be parties to the traffic</s>  the vast lakes andinnumerable rivers of that region however remote as it then wasfrom the ordinary abodes of civilized man offered facilities forcommunication that the active spirit of trade would be certain notto neglect</s>  in the first place there were always the indians tobarter skins and furs against powder lead rifles blankets andunhappily firewater</s>  then the white men who penetrated to thosesemiwilds were always ready to dicker and to swap and totrade rifles and watches and whatever else they might happen topossess almost to their wives and children</s> but we should be doing injustice to le bourdon were we in anymanner to confound him with the dickering race</s>  he was a beehunter quite as much through love of the wilderness and love ofadventure as through love of gain</s>  profitable he had certainlyfound the employment or he probably would not have pursued it butthere was many a man whonay most men even in his own humbleclass in lifewould have deemed his liberal earnings too hardlyobtained when gained at the expense of all intercourse with theirown kind</s>  but buzzing ben loved the solitude of his situation itshazards its quietude relieved by passing moments of highexcitement and most of all the selfreliance that wasindispensable equally to his success and his happiness</s>  woman asyet had never exercised her witchery over him and every day washis passion for dwelling alone and for enjoying the strange butcertainly most alluring pleasures of the woods

hisground in order to avoid collision however friendly with whiteswho like himself were pushing their humble fortunes along theshores of those inland seas which as yet were rarely indeedwhitened by a sail</s>  in this respect boden and waring were the veryantipodes of each other gershom being an inveterate gossip indespite of his attachment to a vagrant and border life</s> the duties of hospitality are rarely forgotten among border men</s>  theinhabitant of a town may lose his natural disposition to receive allwho offer at his board under the pressure of society but it isonly in most extraordinary exceptions that the frontier man is everknown to be inhospitable</s>  he has little to offer but that little isseldom withheld either through prudence or niggardliness</s>  underthis feelingwe might call it habit alsole bourdon now sethimself at work to place on the table such food as he had at commandand ready cooked</s>  the meal which he soon pressed his guests to sharewith him was composed of a good piece of cold boiled pork which benhad luckily cooked the day previously some bears meat roasted afragment of venison steak both lean and cold and the remains of aduck that had been shot the day before in the kalamazoo withbread salt and what was somewhat unusual in the wilderness twoor three onions raw</s>  the last dish was highly relished by gershomand was slightly honored by ben but the indians passed it over withcold indifference</s>  the dessert consisted of bread and honey whichwere liberally partaken of by all at table</s> little was said by either host or guests until the supper wasfinished when the whole party left the chiente to enjoy theirpipes in the cool evening air beneath the oaks of the grove inwhich the dwelling stood</s>  their conversation began to let theparties know something of each others movements and characters</s> you are a pottawattamie and you a chippewa said le bourdon ashe courteously handed to his two red guests pipes of

 of the three hewas the visitor he least respected but the dues of hospitality areusually sacred in a wilderness and among savages so that he coulddo nothing to get rid of him</s>  as gershom manifested no intention toquit the place le bourdon set about the business of the hour withas much method and coolness as if the other had not been present</s> the first thing was to bring home the honey discovered on theprevious day a task of no light labor the distance it was to betransported being so considerable and the quantity so large</s>  butour beehunter was not without the means of

embarked taking with them no less thanfour pieces of firearms one of which was to use the language ofthe west a doublebarrelled shotgun</s>  before quitting the placehowever the beehunter went to a

and securing hisboat was to quiet hive</s>  the animal being under excellent commandthis was soon done the mastiff maintaining the position assignedhim in the rear though evidently impatient to be let loose</s>  had notle bourdon known the precise position of the fallen tree andthrough that the probable position of his enemies he would haveplaced the mastiff in advance as a pioneer or scout but he deemedit necessary under the actual circumstances to hold him as areserve or a force to be directed whither occasion might require</s> with this arrangement then le bourdon and whiskey centre advancedside by side each carrying two pieces from the margin of the rivertoward the open land that commanded a view of the tree</s>  on reachingthe desired point a halt was called in order to reconnoitre</s> the reader will remember that the beeelm had stood on the edge of adense thicket or swamp in which the trees grew to a size severaltimes exceeding those of the oaks in the openings and le bourdonhad caused it to fall upon the open ground in order to work at thehoney with greater ease to himself</s>  consequently the fragments layin full view of the spot where the halt was made</s>  a little togershoms surprise ben now produced his spyglass which helevelled with much earnestness toward the tree</s>  the beehunterhowever well knew his business and was examining into the state ofthe insects whom he had so violently invaded the night before</s>  theair was filled with them flying above and around the tree aperfect cloud of the little creatures hovering directly over thehole

would benecessary to substitute deeds for words</s>  there they come in adrove and they seem in earnest</s> this was true enough</s>  no less than eight bears half of whichhowever were quite young came tumbling over the logs and boundingup toward the fallen tree as if charging the citadel of the bees bypreconcert</s>  their appearance was the signal for a general rally ofthe insects and by the time the foremost of the clumsy animals hadreached the tree the air above and around him was absolutelydarkened by the cloud of bees that was collected to defend theirtreasures</s>  bruin trusted too much to the thickness of his hide andto the defences with which he was provided by nature besides beingtoo much incited by the love of honey to regard the little heroesbut thrust his nose in at the hole doubtless hoping to plunge it atonce into the midst of a mass of the sweets</s>  a growl a startbackward and a flourishing of the forepaws with sundry bites inthe air at once announced that he had met with greater resistancethan he had anticipated</s>  in a minute all the bears were on theirhindlegs beating the air with their forepaws and nipping rightand left with their jaws in vigorous combat with their almostinvisible foes</s>  instinct supplied the place of science and spite ofthe hides and the long hair that covered them the bees found themeans of darting their stings into unprotected places until thequadrupeds were fairly driven to rolling about on the grass in orderto crush their assailants</s>  this last process had some effect agreat many bees being destroyed by the energetic rollings andtumblings of the bears but as in the tide of battle the places ofthose who fell were immediately supplied by fresh assailants untilnumbers seemed likely to prevail over power if not over discipline</s> at this critical instant when the bears seemed fatigued with theirnearly frantic saltations and violent blows upon nothing lebourdon deemed it wise to bring his forces into the combat</s>  gershomhaving been apprised of the plan both fired at the same instant</s> each ball took effect one killing the largest of all the bearsdead on the spot while the other inflicted a

which might shortly beexpected</s>  the former lighted a fire being always provided with themeans while gershom brought dry wood</s>  in less than five minutes abright blaze was gleaming upward and when the bees returned asmost of them soon did they found this new enemy intrenched as itmight be behind walls of flame</s>  thousands of the little creaturesperished by means of this new invention of

commence the process ofcutting and splitting the tree in order to obtain the honey</s>  untilthen the bees lingered around their fallen hive and it would havebeen dangerous to venture beyond the smoke and heat in order toaccomplish the task</s>  it is true le bourdon possessed severalsecrets of more or less virtue to drive off the bees when disposedto assault him but no one that was as certain as a good firebacked by a dense column of vapor</s>  various plants are thought to beso offensive to the insects that they avoid even their odor andthe beehunter had faith in one or two of them but none of theright sort happened now to be near and he was obliged to trustfirst to a powerful heat and next to the vapor of damp wood</s> as there were axes and wedges and a beetle in the canoe andgershom was as expert with these implements as a master of fencingis with his foil to say nothing of the skill of le bourdon thetree was soon laid open and its ample stores of sweets exposed</s>  inthe course of the afternoon the honey was deposited in kegs thekegs were transferred to the canoe and the whole deposited in thechiente</s>  the day had been one of toil and when our two bordermensat down near the

drunk as muchas i want unless i take it societylike</s>  thats one reason ivetaken so mightily to you bourdon youre not much at a pull butyou ant downright afeared of a jug neither</s> the beehunter was glad to hear that all the family had not thismans vice for he now plainly foresaw that the accidents of hisposition must bring him and these strangers much in contact forsome weeks at least</s>  le bourdon though not absolutely afraid of ajug as whiskey centre had expressed it was decidedly a temperateman drinking but seldom and never to excess</s>  he too well knew thehazards by which he was surrounded to indulge in this way even hadhe the taste for it but he had no taste that way one small jug ofbrandy forming his supply for a whole season</s>  in these days ofexaggeration in all things exaggeration in politics in religionin temperance in virtue and even in education by putting newwine into old bottles that one little jug might have sufficed togive him a bad name but fiveandthirty years ago men had more realindependence than they now possess and were not as much afraid ofthat croquemitaine public opinion as they are today</s>  to be sureit was little to le bourdons taste to make a companion of such aperson as whiskey centre but there was no choice</s>  the man was anutter stranger to him and the only means he possessed of makingsure that he did not carry off the property that lay so much at hismercy was by keeping near him</s>  with many men the beehunter wouldhave been uneasy at being compelled to remain alone with them in thewoods for cases in which one had murdered another in order to getpossession of the goods in these remote regions were talked ofamong the other rumors of the borders but gershom had that in hisair and manner that rendered ben confident his delinquencies at themost would scarcely reach bloodshed</s>  pilfer he might but murderwas a crime which he did not appear at all likely to commit</s> after supping in company our two adventurers secured everythingand retiring to the chiente they went to sleep</s>  no materialdisturbance occurred but the night passed in tranquillity the beehunter merely experiencing some slight interruption to his slumbersfrom the unusual circumstance of having a companion</s>  one as longaccustomed to be alone as himself would naturally submit to somesuch sensation our habits getting so completely the mastery asoften to supplant even nature</s> the following morning the beehunter commenced his preparations fora change of residence</s>  had he not been discovered it is probablethat the news received from the chippewa would not have induced himto abandon his present position so early in the season but hethought the risk of remaining was too great under all thecircumstances</s>  the pottawattamie in particular was a subject ofgreat distrust to him and he believed it highly possible some ofthat old chiefs tribe might be after his scalp ere many suns hadrisen</s>  gershom acquiesced in these opinions and as soon as hisbrain was less under the influence of liquor than was common withhim he appeared to be quite happy in having it in his power to forma species of alliance offensive and defensive with a man of hisown color and origin</s>  great harmony now prevailed between the twogershom improving vastly in all the better qualities the instanthis intellect and feelings got to be a little released from thethraldom of the jug</s>  his own immediate store of whiskey was quiteexhausted and le bourdon kept the place in which his own smallstock of brandy was secured a profound secret</s>  these glimmerings ofreturning intellect and of reviving principles are by no meansunusual with the sot thus proving that so long as there is lifethere is hope for the moral as well as for the physical being</s> what was a little remarkable gershom grew less vulgar even in hisdialect as he grew more sober showing that in all respects he wasbecoming a greatly improved person</s> the men were several hours in loading the canoe not only all thestores and ammunition but all the honey being transferred to it</s> the beehunter had managed to conceal his jug of brandy reduced bythis time to little more than a quart within an empty powderkeginto which he had crammed a beaverskin or two that he had takenas it might be incidentally in the course of his rambles</s>  at lengtheverything was removed and stowed in its proper place on board thecapacious canoe and gershom expected an announcement on the part ofben of his readiness to embark</s>  but there still remained one duty toperform</s>  the beehunter had killed a buck only the day before theopening of our narrative and shouldering a quarter he had left theremainder of the animal suspended from the branches of a tree nearthe place where it had been shot and cleaned</s>  as venison might beneeded before they could reach the mouth of the river ben deemed itadvisable that he and gershom should go and bring in the remainderof the carcass</s>  the men started on this undertaking accordinglyleaving the canoe about two in the afternoon</s> the distance between the spot where the deer had been killed andthe chiente was about three miles which was the reason why thebeehunter had not brought home the entire animal the day he killedit the american woodsman often carrying his game great distances inpreference to leaving it any length of time in the forest</s>  in thelatter case there is always danger from beasts of prey which aredrawn from afar by the scent of blood</s>  le bourdon thought itpossible they might now encounter wolves though he had left thecarcass of the deer so suspended as to place it beyond the reach ofmost of the animals of the wilderness</s>  each of the men howevercarried a rifle and hive was allowed to accompany them by an actof grace on the part of his master</s> for the first halfhour nothing occurred out of the usual course ofevents</s>  the beehunter had been conversing freely with hiscompanion who he rejoiced to find manifested far more commonsense not to say good sense than he had previously shown and fromwhom he was deriving information touching the number of vessels andthe other movements on the lakes that he fancied might be of use tohimself when he started for detroit</s>  while thus engaged and whendistant only a hundred rods from the place where he had left thevenison le bourdon was suddenly struck with the movements of thedog</s>  instead of doubling on his own tracks and scenting right andleft as was the animals wont he was now advancing cautiouslywith his head low seemingly feeling his way with his nose as ifthere was a strong taint in the wind</s> sartain as my name is gershom exclaimed waring just after he andben had come to a halt

his rifle across his lap andcant have much dread of wolves or bears</s> i see him answered le bourdon and am as much surprised asgrieved to find him there</s>  it is a little remarkable that i shouldhave so many visitors just at this time on my huntingground wheni never had any at all before yesterday</s>  it gives a body anuncomfortable feeling waring to live so much in a crowd</s>  wellwellim about to move and it will matter little twentyfour hourshence</s> the chaps a winnebago by his paint added gershombut lets goup and give him a call</s> the beehunter assented to this proposal remarking as they movedforward that he did not think the stranger of the tribe just namedthough he admitted that the use of paint was so general and looseamong these warriors as to render it difficult to decide</s> the crittur sleeps soundly</s>  exclaimed gershom stopping withinten yards of the indian to take another look at him</s> hell never awake put in the beehunter solemnlythe man isdead</s>  see there is blood on the side of his head and a riflebullet has left its hole there</s> even while speaking the beehunter advanced and raising a sort ofshawl that once had been used as an ornament and which had lastbeen thrown carelessly over the head of its late owner he exposedthe wellknown features of elksfoot the pottawattamie who hadleft them little more than twentyfour hours before</s>  the warrior hadbeen shot by a riflebullet directly through the temple and hadbeen scalped</s>  the powder had been taken from his horn and thebullets from his pouch but beyond this he had not been plundered</s> the body was carefully placed against a tree in a sitting attitudethe rifle was laid across its legs and there it had been left inthe centre of the openings to become food for beasts of prey andto have its bones bleached by the snows and the rains</s> the beehunter shuddered as he gazed at this fearful memorial ofthe violence against which even a wilderness could afford nosufficient protection</s>  that pigeonswing had slain his late fellowguest le bourdon had no doubt and he sickened at the thought</s> although he had himself dreaded a good deal from the hostility ofthe pottawattamie he could have wished this deed undone</s>  that therewas a jealous distrust of each other between the two indians hadbeen sufficiently apparent but the beehunter could not haveimagined that it would so soon lead to results as terrible as these</s> after examining the body and noting the state of things around itthe men proceeded deeply impressed with the necessity not only oftheir speedy removal but of their standing by each other in thatremote region now that violence had so clearly broken out among thetribes</s>  the beehunter had taken a strong liking to the chippewaand he regretted so much the more to think that he had done thisdeed</s>  it was true that such a state of things might exist as tojustify an indian warrior agreeably to his own notions in takingthe life of any one of a hostile tribe but le bourdon wished it hadbeen otherwise</s>  a man of gentle and peaceable disposition himselfthough of a profoundly enthusiastic temperament in his own

she haslost most of her friends since gershom fell into these ways and itwould quite break her heart did i desert her</s> all this speaks well for you pretty margery but it is not theless surprisingah

burroak</s>  hours and hours have i sat on thatspot with my sewing while gershom was gone into the openings</s> and dollywhere was she while you were here</s> poor dolly</s> i do think she passed

charming maiden looked down and blushed</s> fortunately the two now soon arrived at the tree and theirconversation naturally reverted to the subject which had broughtthem there</s>  three canoes were in sight close in with the land butso distant as to render it for some time doubtful which way theywere moving</s>  at first the beehunter said that they were stillgoing slowly to the southward but he habitually carried his littleglass and on levelling that it was quite apparent that thesavages were paddling before the wind and making for the mouth ofthe river</s>  this was a very grave fact and as blossom flew tocommunicate it to her brother and his wife le bourdon moved towardhis own canoe and looked about for a place of concealment</s> several considerations had to be borne in mind in disposing of thecanoes for that of gershom was to be secreted as well as that ofthe beehunter</s>  a tall aquatic plant that is termed wild rice andwhich we suppose to be the ordinary riceplant unimproved bytillage grows spontaneously about the mouths and on the flats ofmost of the rivers of the part of michigan of which we are writingas indeed it is to be found in nearly all the shallow waters ofthose regions</s>  there was a good deal of this rice at hand and thebeehunter paddling his own canoe and towing the other enteredthis vegetable thicket choosing a channel that had been formed bysome accident of nature and which wound through the herbage in away soon to conceal all that came within its limits</s>  these channelswere not only numerous but exceedingly winding and the beehunterhad no sooner brought his canoes to the firm ground and fastenedthem there than he ascended a tree and studied the windings ofthese narrow passages until he had got a general idea of theirdirection and characters</s>  this precaution taken he hurried back tothe hut</s> well gershom have you settled on the course to be taken</s>  werethe first words uttered by the beehunter when he rejoined thefamily of whiskey centre</s> we havent answered the husband</s>  sister begs us to quit thechiente for the indians must soon be here but wife seems to thinkthat she must be safe now im at

they busiedthemselves in this task</s>  the effects of whiskey centre had beengradually diminishing in quantity as well as in value for the lastthree years and were now of no great amount in any sense</s>  stillthere were two chests one large and one small</s>  the last containedall that a generous regard for the growing wants of the family hadleft to margery while the first held the joint wardrobes of thehusband and wife with a few other articles that were considered asvaluable</s>  among other things were half a dozen of very thin silverteaspoons which had fallen to gershom on a division of familyplate</s>  the other six were carefully wrapped up in paper and put inthe till of margerys chest being her portion of this species ofproperty</s>  the americans generally have very little plate thoughhere and there marked exceptions do exist nor do the humblerclasses lay out much of their earnings in jewelry while theycommonly dress far beyond their means in all other ways</s>  in thisrespect the european female of the same class in life frequentlypossesses as much in massive golden personal ornaments as would makean humble little fortune while her attire is as homely as cumbrouspetticoats coarse cloth and a vile taste can render it</s>  on theother hand the american matron that has not a setone halfdozenof silver teaspoons must be poor indeed and can hardly be said tobelong to the order of housekeepers at all</s>  by means of a carefulmother both gershom and his sister had the halfdozen mentionedand they were kept more as sacred memorials of past and better daysthan as articles of any use</s>  the household goods of waring wouldhave been limited by his means of transportation if not by hispoverty</s>  two common lowpost maple bedsteads were soon uncorded

all that venerable ideas of decorum could suggest until thisappliance of domestic ease has not only fairly planted itself innearly every american dwelling but in a good many of europe also</s> it required about twenty minutes for the party to clear the cabin ofevery article that might induce an indian to suspect the presence ofwhite men</s>  the furniture was carried to a sufficient distance to besafe from everything but a search and care was had to avoid as muchas possible making a trail to lead the savages to the placeselected for the temporary storeroom</s>  this was merely a closethicket into which there was a narrow but practicable entrance onthe side the least likely to be visited</s>  when all was accomplishedthe four went to the lookout to ascertain how far the canoes hadcome</s>  it was soon ascertained that they were within a mile drivingdown before a strong breeze and following sea and impelled by asmany paddles as there were living beings in them</s>  ten minutes wouldcertainly bring them up with the bar and five more fairly withinthe river</s>  the question now arose where the party was to beconcealed during the stay of the savages</s>  dolly as was perhapsnatural for the housewife wished to remain by her worldly goodsand pretty margery had a strong feminine leaning to do the same</s>  butneither of the men approved of the plan</s>  it was risking too much inone spot and a suggestion that the beehunter was not long inmaking prevailed</s> it will be remembered that le bourdon had carried the canoes withinthe field of wild rice and bestowed them there with a good deal ofattention to security</s>  now these canoes offered in many respectsbetter places of temporary refuge under all the circumstances thanany other that could readily be found on shore</s>  they were dry andby spreading skins of which boden had so many comfortable bedsmight be made for the females which would be easily protected fromthe night air and dews by throwing a rug over the gunwales</s>  theneach canoe contained many articles that would probably be wantedthat of the beehunter in particular furnishing food in abundanceas well as diverse other things that would be exceedingly useful topersons in their situation</s>  the great advantage of the canoeshowever in the mind of le bourdon was the facilities they offeredfor flight</s>  he hardly hoped that indian sagacity would be so farblinded as to prevent the discovery of the many footsteps they musthave left in their hurried movements and he anticipated that withthe return of day something would occur to render it necessary forthem to seek safety by a stealthy removal from the spot</s>  this mightbe done he both hoped and believed under cover of the rice shouldsufficient care be taken to avoid exposure</s>  in placing the canoeshe had used the precaution to leave them where they could not beseen from the cabin or its vicinity or indeed from any spot inthe vicinity of the ground that the savages would be likely to visitduring their stay</s>  all these reasons le bourdon now rapidly laidbefore his companions and to the canoes the whole party retired asfast as they could walk</s> there was great judgment displayed on the part of the beehunter inselecting the wild rice as a place of shelter</s>  at that season it wassufficiently grown to afford a complete screen to everything withinit that did not exceed the height of a man or which was not seenfrom some adjacent elevation</s>  most of the land near the mouth of theriver was low and the few spots which formed exceptions had beenborne in mind when the canoes were taken into the field</s>  but just asgershom was on the point of putting a foot into his own canoe witha view to arrange it for the reception of his wife he drew backand exclaimed after the manner of one to whom a most important ideasuddenly occurslands sake</s>  ive forgotten all about them barrels</s>  theyll fallinto the hands of the savages and an awful time theyll make withthem</s>  let me pass dolly i must look after the barrels thisinstant</s> while the wife gently detained her eager husband the beehunterquietly asked to what barrels he alluded</s> the whiskey casks was the answer</s>  theres two on em in the shedbehind the hut and whiskey enough to set a whole tribe incommotion</s>  i wonder i should have overlooked the whiskey</s> it is a sign of great improvement friend waring and will lead tono bad consequences returned le bourdon coolly</s>  i foresaw thedanger and rolled the casks down the hill where they were dashedto pieces in the brook and the liquor has long since been carriedinto the lake in the shape of grog</s> waring seemed astounded but was so completely mystified as not tosuspect the truth</s>  that his liquor should be hopelessly lost was badenough but even that was better than to have it drunk by savageswithout receiving any returns</s>  after groaning and lamenting overthe loss for a few minutes he joined the rest of the party inmaking some further dispositions which le bourdon deemed prudentif not necessary</s> it had occurred to the beehunter to divide his own cargo betweenthe two canoes which was the task that the whole party was nowengaged in</s>  the object was to lighten his own canoe in the event offlight and by placing his effects in two parcels give a chance tothose in the boat which might escape of having wherewithal tocomfort and console themselves</s>  as soon as this new arrangement wascompleted le bourdon ran up to a tree that offered the desiredfacilities and springing into its branches was soon high enough toget a view of the bar and the mouth of the river</s>  by the partinglight of day he distinctly saw four canoes coming up the streamwhich was one more than those reported to him by margery as havingpassed</s> chapter vi</s>  and long shall timorous fancy see the painted chief and pointed spear and reasons self shall bow the knee to shadows and delusions here</s>       freneau</s> a bright moon reflected on the earth for about an hour the light ofthe sun as the latter luminary disappeared</s>  by its aid the beehunter who still continued in the tree was enabled to watch themovements of the canoes of the indians though the persons theycontained soon got to be so indistinct as to render it impossible todo more than count their numbers</s>  the last he made out to be fiveeach in three of the canoes and six in the other making twentyoneindividuals in all</s>  this was too great an odds to think ofresisting in the event of the strangers turning out to be hostileand the knowledge of this disparity in force admonished all thefugitives of the necessity of being wary and prudent</s> the strangers landed just beneath the hut or at the precise spotwhere whiskey centre was in the habit of keeping his canoe andwhence boden had removed it only an hour or two before</s>  the savageshad probably selected the place on account of its shores being clearof the wild rice and because the high ground near it promised botha lookout and comfortable lodgings</s>  several of the party strolledupward as if searching for an eligible spot to light their fireand one of them soon discovered the cabin</s>  the warrior announced hissuccess by a whoop and a dozen of the indians were shortlycollected in and about the chiente</s>  all this proved the prudence ofthe course taken by the fugitives</s> blossom stood beneath the tree and the beehunter told her as eachincident occurred all that passed among the strangers when thegirl communicated the same to her brother and his wife who werequite near at hand in one of the canoes</s>  as there was no danger ofbeing overheard conversation in an ordinary tone passed between theparties two of whom at least were now fond of holding this sort ofcommunion</s> do they seem to suspect the neighborhood of the occupants of thecabin</s>  asked margery when the beehunter had let her know themanner in which the savages had taken possession of her latedwelling</s> one cannot tell</s>  savages are always distrustful and cautious whenon a warpath and these seem to be scenting

no further needof it</s>  tell me bourdon do any go near the thicket of alders wherewe have hidden our goods</s> not as yet though there is a sudden movement and many loud yellsamong them</s> heaven send that it may not be at having discovered anything wehave forgotten</s>  the sight of even a lost dipper or cup would setthem bloodhounds on our path as sure as we are white and they aresavages</s> as i live they scent the whiskey</s>  there is a rush toward and apowwow in and about the shedyes of a certainty they smell theliquor</s>  some of it has escaped in rolling down the hill and theirnoses are too keen to pass over a fragrance that to them equals thatof roses</s>  well let them scent as they mayeven an injin does notget drunk through his nose</s> you are quite right bourdon but is not this a most unhappy scentfor us since the smell of whiskey can hardly be there without theirseeing it did not grow in the woods of itself like an oak or abeech</s> i understand you margery and there is good sense in what you say</s> they will never think the liquor grew there</s>  like a blackberry or achestnut though the place is called whiskey centre</s> it is hard enough to know that a family has deserved such a namewithout being reminded of it by those that call themselves friendsanswered the girl pointedly after a pause of near a minute thoughshe spoke in sorrow rather than in anger</s> in an instant the beehunter was at pretty margerys side makinghis peace by zealous apologies and winning protestations of respectand concern</s>  the mortified girl was soon appeased and afterconsulting together for a minute they went to the canoe tocommunicate to the husband and wife what they had seen</s> the whiskey after all is likely to prove our worst enemy said thebeehunter as he approached</s>  it would seem that in moving thebarrels some of the liquor has escaped and the nose of an injin istoo quick for the odor it leaves not to scent it</s> much good may it do them growled gershomtheyve lost me thatwhiskey and let them long for it without gettin any as apunishment for the same</s>  my fortun would have been made could ionly have got them two barrels as far as fort dearborn before thetroops moved</s> the barrels might have been got there certainly answered lebourdon so much provoked at the mans regrets for the destroyerwhich had already come so near to bringing want and ruin on himselfand family as momentarily to forget his recent scene with prettymargery but whether anything would have been in them is anotherquestion</s>  one of those i rolled to the brow of the hill was halfempty as it was</s> gershom is so troubled with the ague if he dont take stimulant inthis new country put in the wife in the apologetic manner inwhich woman struggles to conceal the failings of him she loves</s>  asfor the whiskey i dont grudge that in the least for its a poorway of getting rich to be selling it to soldiers who want all thereason liquor has left em and more too</s>  still gershom needsbitters and ought not to have every drop he has taken thrown intohis face</s> by this time le bourdon was again sensible of his mistake and hebeat a retreat in the best manner he could secretly resolving notto place himself any more between two fires in consequence offurther blunders on this delicate subject</s>  he now found that it wasa very different thing to joke whiskey centre himself on the subjectof his great failing from making even the most distant allusion toit in the presence of those who felt for a husbands and a brothersweakness with a liveliness of feeling that brutal indulgence hadlong since destroyed in the object of their solicitude</s>  heaccordingly pointed out the risk there was that the indians shouldmake the obvious inference that human beings must have recentlybeen in the hut to leave the fresh scent of the liquor in questionbehind them</s>  this truth was so apparent that all felt its forcethough to no one else did the danger seem so great as to the beehunter</s>  he had greater familiarity with the indian character thanany of his companions and dreaded the sagacity of the savages in ajust proportion to his greater knowledge</s>  he did not failtherefore to admonish his new friends of the necessity forvigilance</s> i will return to the tree and take another look at the movements ofthe savages le bourdon concluded by saying</s>  by this time theirfire must be lighted and by the aid of my glass a better insightmay be had into their plans and feelings</s> the beehunter now went back to his tree whither he was slowlyfollowed by margery the girl yielding to a feverish desire toaccompany him at the very time she was half restrained by maidenbashfulness though anxiety and the wish to learn the worst asspeedily as possible prevailed</s> they have kindled a blazing fire and the whole of the inside ofthe house is as bright as if illuminated said le bourdon who wasnow carefully bestowed among the branches of his small tree</s>  thereare lots of the red devils moving about the chiente inside and outand they seem to have fish as well as venison to cook</s>  aye theregoes more dry brush on the fire to brighten up the picture anddaylight is almost eclipsed</s>  as i live they have a prisoner amongem</s> a prisoner</s>  exclaimed margery in the gentle tones of female pity</s> not a white person surely</s> nohe is a redskin like all of thembutwait a minute till ican get the glass a little more steady</s>  yesit is soi was rightat first</s> what is so bourdonand in what are you right</s> you may remember blossom that your brother and i spoke of the twoinjins who visited me in the openings</s>  one was a pottawattamie andthe other a chippewa</s>  the first we found dead and scalped after hehad left us and the last is now in yonder hut bound and aprisoner</s>  he has taken to the lake on his way to fort dearborn andhas with all his craft and resolution fallen into enemies hands</s> well will it be for him if his captors do not learn what befell thewarrior who was slain near my cabin and left seated against atree</s> do you think these savages mean to revenge the death of theirbrother on this unfortunate wretch</s> i know that he is in the pay of our general at detroit while thepottawattamies are in the pay of the english</s>  this of itself wouldmake them enemies and has no doubt been the cause of his beingtaken but i do not well see how injins on the lake here can knowanything of what happened some fifty miles or so up in theopenings</s> perhaps the savages in the canoes belong to the same party as thewarrior you call elksfoot and that they have had the means oflearning his death and by whose hand he fell</s> the beehunter was surprised at the quickness of the girls wit thesuggestion being as discreet as it was ingenious</s>  the manner inwhich intelligence flies through the wilderness had often surprisedhim and certainly it was possible that the party now before himmight have heard of the fate of the chief whose body he had found inthe openings short as was the time for the news to have gone sofar</s>  the circumstance that the canoes had come from the northwardwas against the inference however and after musing a minute on thefacts le bourdon mentioned this objection to his companion</s> are we certain these are the same canoes as those which i saw passthis afternoon</s>  asked margery who comprehended the difficulty inan instant</s>  of those i saw two passed first and one followedwhile here are four that have landed</s> what you say may be true enough</s>  we are not to suppose that thecanoes you saw pass are all that are on the lake</s>  but let thesavages be whom they may prudence tells us to keep clear of them ifwe can and this more so than ever now i can see that pigeonswingwho i know to be an american injin is treated by them as an enemy</s> how are the savages employed now bourdon</s>  do they prepare to eator do they torture their prisoner</s> no fear of their attempting the last tonight</s>  there is anuneasiness about them as if they still smelt the liquor but someare busy cooking at the fire</s>  i would give all my honey prettymargery to be able to save pigeonswing</s>  he is a good fellow for asavage and is heart and hand with us in this new war that he tellsme has begun between us and the english</s> you surely would not risk your own life to save a savage who killsand scalps at random as this man has done</s> in that he has but followed the habits of his color and race</s>  idare say we do things that are quite as bad according to injin waysof thinking</s>  i do believe margery was that man to see me in thehands of the pottawattamies as i now see him he would undertakesomething for my relief</s> but what can you a single man do when there are twenty againstyou</s>  asked margery a little reproachfully as to manner speakinglike one who had more interest in the safety of the young beehunterthan she chose very openly to express</s> no one can say what he can do till he tries</s>  i do not like the waythey are treating that chippewa for it looks as if they meant to dohim harm</s>  he is neither fed nor suffered to be with his mastersbut there the poor fellow is bound hand and foot near the cabindoor and lashed to a tree</s>  they do not even give him the relief ofsuffering him to sit down</s> the gentle heart of margery was touched by this account of themanner in which the captive was treated and she inquired into otherparticulars concerning his situation with a more marked interestthan she had previously manifested in his state</s>  the beehunteranswered her questions as they were put and the result was to placethe girl in possession of a minute detail of the true manner inwhich pigeonswing was treated</s> although there was probably no intention on the part of the captorsof the chippewa to torture him before his time tortured he musthave been by the manner in which his limbs and body were confined</s> not only were his arms fastened behind his back at the elbows butthe hands were also tightly bound together in front</s>  the legs hadligatures in two places just above the knees and just below theankles</s>  around the body was another fastening which secured thecaptive to a beech that stood about thirty feet from the door of thecabin and so nearly in a line with the fire within and the lookoutof le bourdon as to enable the last distinctly to note theseparticulars aided as he was by his glass</s>  relying on the manner inwhich they secured their prisoner the savages took little heed ofhim but each appeared bent on attending to his own comfort bymeans of a good supper and by securing a dry lair in which to passthe night</s>  all this le bourdon saw and noted too ere he droppedlightly on his feet by the side of margery at the root of the tree</s> without losing time that was precious the beehunter went at onceto the canoes and communicated his intention to waring</s>  the moon hadnow set and the night was favorable to the purpose of le bourdon</s> at the first glance it might seem wisest to wait until sleep hadfallen upon the savages ere any attempt were made to approach thehut but boden reasoned differently</s>  a general silence would succeedas soon as the savages disposed of themselves to sleep which wouldbe much more likely to allow his footsteps to be overheard thanwhen tongues and bodies and teeth were all in active movement</s>  a manwho eats after a long march or a severe paddling usuallyconcentrates his attention on his food as le bourdon knew by longexperience and it is a much better moment to steal upon the hungryand weary to do so when they feed than to do so when they sleepprovided anything like a watch be kept</s>  that the pottawattamie wouldneglect this latter caution le bourdon did not believe and his mindwas made up not only to attempt the rescue of his chippewa friendbut to attempt it at once</s> after explaining his plan in a few words and requesting waringsassistance le bourdon took a solemn leave of the party andproceeded at once toward the hut</s>  in order to understand themovements of the beehunter it may be well now briefly to explainthe position of the chiente and the nature of the ground on whichthe adventurer was required to act</s>  the hut stood on a low andsomewhat abrupt swell being surrounded on all sides by land so lowas to be in many places wet and swampy</s>  there were a good many treeson the knoll and several thickets of alders and other bushes on thelower ground but on the whole the swamps were nearly devoid ofwhat is termed timber</s>  two sides of the knoll were abrupt that onwhich the casks had been rolled into the lake and that oppositewhich was next to the tree where boden had so long been watching theproceedings of the savages</s>  the distance between the hut and thistree was somewhat less than a mile</s>  the intervening ground was lowand most of it was marshy though it was possible to cross the marshby following a particular course</s>  fortunately this course which wasvisible to the eye by daylight and had been taken by the fugitiveson quitting the hut might be dimly traced at night by one whounderstood the ground by means of certain trees and bushes thatformed so many fingerposts for the traveller</s>  unless thisparticular route were taken however a circuit of three or fourmiles must be made in order to pass from the chiente to the spotwhere the family had taken refuge</s>  as le bourdon had crossed thisfirm ground by daylight and had observed it well from his tree hethought himself enough of a guide to find his way through it in thedark aided by the marks just mentioned</s> the beehunter had got as far as the edge of the marsh on his waytoward the hut when pausing an instant to examine the priming ofhis rifle he fancied that he heard a light footstep behind him</s> turning quick as thought he perceived that pretty margery hadfollowed him thus far</s>  although time pressed he could not part fromthe girl without showing that he appreciated the interest shemanifested in his behalf</s>  taking her hand therefore he spoke witha simplicity and truth that imparted to his manner a natural gracethat one bred in courts might have envied</s>  what was more with adelicacy that few in course would deem necessary under thecircumstances he did not in his language so much impute to concernon his own account this movement of margerys as to that she feltfor her brother and sister though in his inmost heart a throbbinghope prevailed that he had his share in it</s> do not be troubled on account of gershom and his wife prettymargery said the beehunter which as i perceive is the mainreason why you have come here and as for myself be certain that ishall not forget who i have left behind and how much her safetydepends on my prudence</s> margery was pleased though a good deal confused</s>  it was new to herto hear allusions of this sort but nature supplied the feeling toappreciate them</s> is it not risking too much bourdon</s>  she said</s>  are you sure ofbeing able to find the crossing in the marsh in a night so verydark</s>  i do not know but looking so long at the bright light in thecabin may blind me but it does seem as if i never saw a darkernight</s> the darkness increases for the starlight is gone but i can seewhere i go and so long as i can do that there is not much fear oflosing my way</s>  i do not like to expose you to danger butnever mind me bourdonset me to do anything in which you think ican be of use</s>  exclaimed the girl eagerly</s> well then margery you may do this come with me to the large treein the centre of the marsh and i will set you on a duty that maypossibly save my life</s>  i will tell you my meaning when there</s> margery followed with a light impatient step and as neitherstopped to speak or to look around the two soon stood beneath thetree in question</s>  it was a large elm that completely overshadowed aconsiderable extent of firm ground</s>  here a full and tolerably nearview could be had of the hut which was still illuminated by theblazing fire within</s>  for a minute both stood silently gazing at thestrange scene then le bourdon explained to his companion the mannerin which she might assist him</s> once at the elm it was not so difficult to find the way across themarsh as it was to reach that spot coming from the chiente</s>  asthere were several elms scattered about in the centre of the marshthe beehunter was fearful that he might not reach the right treein which case he would be compelled to retrace his steps and thatat the imminent hazard of being captured</s>  he carried habitually asmall dark lantern and had thought of so disposing of it in thelower branches of this very elm as to form a focus of it buthesitated about doing that which might prove a guide to his enemiesas well as to himself</s>  if margery would take charge of this lanternhe could hope to reap its advantages without incurring the hazard ofhaving a light suspended in the tree for any length of time</s>  margeryunderstood the lessons she received and promised to obey all theinjunctions by which they were accompanied</s> now god bless you margery added the beehunter</s>  providence hasbrought me and your brothers family together in troublesome timesshould i get back safe from this adventure i shall look upon it asa duty to do all i can to help gershom place his wife and sisterbeyond the reach of harm</s> god bless you bourdon</s>  half whispered the agitated girl</s>  i knowit is worth some risk to save a human life even though it be thatof an injin and i will not try to persuade you from thisundertaking but do not attempt more than is necessary and rely onmy using the lantern just as you have told me to use it</s> those young persons had not yet known each other a single day yetboth felt that confidence which years alone in the crowds of theworld can ordinarily create in the human mind</s>  the cause of thesympathy which draws heart to heart which generates friendshipsand love and passionate attachments is not obvious to all whochoose to talk of it</s>  there is yet a profound mystery in ourorganization which has hitherto escaped the researches of bothclasses of philosophers and which it probably was the design of thecreator should not be made known to us until we draw nearer to thatgreat end which sooner or later is to be accomplished in behalf ofour race when knowledge will abound and we shall betterunderstand our being and its objects than is permitted to us inthis our day of ignorance</s>  but while we cannot trace the causes of athousand things we know and feel their effects</s>  among the othermysteries of our nature is this of sudden and strong sympathieswhich as between men for men and women for women awakenconfidence and friendship and as between those of different sexesexcite passionate attachments that more or less color their futurelives</s>  the great delineator of our common nature in no one of themany admirable pictures he has drawn of men manifests a moreprofound knowledge of his subject than in that in which he portraysthe sudden and nearly ungovernable inclination which romeo andjuliet are made to display for each other an inclination that setsreason habit prejudice and family enmities at defiance</s>  that suchan attachment is to be commended we do not say that all can feelit we do not believe that connections formed under its influencecan always be desirable we are far from thinking but that it mayexist we believe is just as certain as any of the incomprehensiblelaws of our wayward and yet admirable nature</s>  we have no veronesetale to relate here however but simply a homely legend in whichhuman feeling may occasionally be made to bear an humble resemblanceto that worldrenowned picture which had its scenes in the beautifulcapital of venetian lombardy</s>
when le bourdon left his companion now so intensely interested inhis success to pick his way in the darkness across the remainder ofthe marsh margery retired behind the tree where the first thingshe did was to examine her lantern and to see that its light wasready to perform the very important office which might so speedilybe required of it</s>  satisfied on this point she turned her eyesanxiously in the direction of the hut</s>  by this time every trace ofthe beehunter was lost the hillock in his front forming too dark abackground to admit of his being seen</s>  but the fire still blazed inthe chiente the savages not having yet finished their cookingthough several had satisfied their appetites and had already soughtplaces where they might stretch themselves for the night</s>  margerywas glad to see that these last individuals bestowed themselveswithin the influence of the fire warm as was the night</s>  this wasdone most probably to escape from the annoyance of the mosquitosmore or less of which are usually found in the low lands of the newcountries and near the margins of rivers</s> margery could distinctly see the chippewa erect and bound to histree</s>  on him she principally kept her looks riveted for near hisperson did she expect first again to find the beehunter</s>  indeedthere was no chance of seeing one who was placed beneath the lightof the fire since the brow of the acclivity formed a completecover throwing all below it into deep shade</s>  this circumstance wasof the greatest importance to the adventurer however enabling himto steal quite near to his friend favored by a darkness that wasgetting to be intense</s>  quitting margery we will now rejoin lebourdon who by this time was approaching his goal</s> the beehunter had some difficulty in finding his way across themarsh but floundering through the impediments and on the wholepreserving the main direction he got out on the firm ground quiteas soon as he had expected to do</s>  it was necessary for him to useextreme caution</s>  the indians according to their custom had dogs twoof which had been in sight lying about halfway between theprisoner and the door of the hut</s>  boden had seen a savage feedingthese dogs and it appeared to him at the time as if the indian hadbeen telling them to be watchful of the chippewa</s>  he well knew theservices that the red men expected of these animals which are keptrather as sentinels than for any great use they put them to in thehunts</s>  an indian dog is quick enough to give the alarm and he willkeep on a trail for a long run and with considerable accuracy butit is seldom that he closes and has his share in the death unlessin the case of very timid and powerless creatures</s> nevertheless the presence of these dogs exacted extra caution inthe movements of the beehunter</s>  he had ascended the hill a littleout of the stream of light which still issued from the open door ofthe hut and was soon high enough to get a good look at the state ofthings on the bit of level land around the cabin</s>  fully onehalf ofthe savages were yet up and in motion though the processes ofcooking and eating were by this time nearly ended</s>  these men hadsenses almost as acute as those of their dogs and it was verynecessary to be on his guard against them also</s>  by moving with theutmost caution le bourdon reached the edge of the line of lightwhere he was within ten yards of the captive</s>  here he placed hisrifle against a small tree and drew his knife in readiness to cutthe prisoners thongs</s>  three several times while the beehunter wasmaking these preparations did the two dogs raise their heads andscent the air once the oldest of the two gave a deep and mostominous growl</s>  singular as it may seem this last indication ofgiving the alarm was of great service to le bourdon and thechippewa</s>  the latter heard the growl and saw two of the movementsof the animals heads from all which he inferred that there wassome creature or some danger behind him</s>  this naturally enoughinduced him to bestow a keen attention in that direction and beingunable to turn body limbs or head the sense of hearing was hisonly means of watchfulness</s>  it was while in this state of profoundlistening that pigeonswing fancied he heard his own name in such awhisper as one raises when he wishes to call from a short distancewith the least possible expenditure of voice</s>  presently the wordspigeonswing and chippewa were succeeded by those of beehunter bourdon</s>  this was enough the quickwitted warrior made alow ejaculation such as might be mistaken for a halfsuppressedmurmur that proceeded from pain but which one keenly on the watchand who was striving to communicate with him would be apt tounderstand as a sign of attention</s>  the whispering then ceasedaltogether and the prisoner waited the result with the stoicpatience of an american indian</s>  a minute later the chippewa felt thethongs giving way and his arms were released at the elbows</s>  an armwas next passed round his body and the fastenings at the wrist werecut</s>  at this instant a voice whispered in his ear be of goodheart chippewayour friend bourdon is here</s>  can you stand</s> no stand answered the indian in a low whispertoo much tie</s> at the next moment the feet of the chippewa were released as werealso his knees</s>  of all the fastenings none now remained but thatwhich bound the captive to the tree</s>  in not cutting this the beehunter manifested his coolness and judgment for were the stout ropeof bark severed the indian would have fallen like a log from totalinability to stand</s>  his thongs had impeded the circulation of theblood and the usual temporary paralysis had been the consequence</s> pigeonswing understood the reason of his friends forbearance andmanaged to rub his hands and wrists together while the beehunterhimself applied friction to his feet by passing his own arms aroundthe bottom of the tree</s>  the reader may imagine the intense anxietyof margery the while for she witnessed the arrival of le bourdon atthe tree and could not account for the long delay which succeeded</s> all this time the dogs were far from being quiet or satisfied</s> their masters accustomed to being surrounded at night by wolves andfoxes or other beasts took little heed however of the discontentof these creatures which were in the habit of growling in theirlairs</s>  the beehunter as he kept rubbing at his friends legs feltnow but little apprehension of the dogs though a new source ofalarm presented itself by the time the chippewa was barely able tosustain his weight on his feet and long before he could use themwith anything like his former agility</s>  the manner in which thesavages came together in the hut and the gestures made by theirchief announced pretty plainly that a watch was about to be set forthe night</s>  as it was probable that the sentinel would take hisstation near the prisoner the beehunter was at a loss to decidewhether it were better to commence the flight before or after therest of the savages were in their lairs</s>  placing his mouth as closeto the ear of pigeonswing as could be done without bringing his headinto the light the following dialogue passed between le bourdon andthe captive</s> do you see chippewa the beehunter commenced the chief istelling one of the young men to come and keep guard near you</s> see him well nough</s>  make too many sign no to see</s> what think youshall we wait till the warriors are asleep or tryto be off before the sentinel comes</s> bess wait if one ting</s>  you got riflegot tomahawkgot knifeeh</s> i have them all though my rifle is a short distance behind me anda little down the hill</s> dat badnebber let go rifle on warpath</s>  well you tomahawk himi scalp himdatll do</s> i shall kill no man chippewa unless there is great occasion forit</s>  if there is no other mode of getting you off i shall choose tocut this last thong and leave you to take care of yourself</s> give him tomahawk dengive him knife too</s> not for such a purpose</s>  i do not like to shed blood without a goodreason for it</s> no call war good reason eh</s>  bess reason in world pottawattamie digup hatchet agin great fadder at washtondat no good reason whytake his scalp eh</s> in whispering these last words the chippewa used so much energythat the dogs again raised their heads from between their forepawsand growled</s>  almost at that instant the chief and his few remainingwakeful companions laid themselves down to sleep and the youngwarrior designated as the sentinel left the hut and came slowlytoward the prisoner</s>  the circumstances admitted of no delay lebourdon pressed the keen edge of his knife across the withe thatbound the indian to the tree first giving him notice in order thathe might be prepared to sustain his own weight</s>  this done the beehunter dropped on the ground crawling away out of the light thoughthe brow of the hill almost immediately formed a screen to concealhis person from all near the hut</s>  in another instant he had regainedhis rifle and was descending swiftly toward the crossing at themarsh</s> chapter vii</s>  we call them savageoh be just</s>   their outraged feelings scan a voice comes forth tis from the dust  the savage was a man</s>       sprague</s> as soon as le bourdon reached the commencement of that which mightbe called his path across the marsh he stopped and looked backward</s> he was now sufficiently removed from the low acclivity to seeobjects on its summit and had no difficulty in discerning all thatthe waning fire illuminated</s>  there stood the chippewa erect againstthe tree as if still bound with thongs while the sentinel wasslowly approaching him</s>  the dogs were on their feet and gave two orthree sharp barks which had the effect to cause five or six of thesavages to lift their heads in their lairs</s>  one arose even and threwan armful of dried branches on the fire producing a bright blazethat brought everything around the hut and which the light couldtouch into full view</s> the beehunter was astonished at the immovable calmness with whichpigeonswing still stood to his tree awaiting the approach of thesentinel</s>  in a few moments the latter was at his side</s>  at first thepottawattamie did not perceive that the prisoner was unbound</s>  hethrew him into shadow by his own person and it required a closelook to note the circumstance</s>  boden was too far from the spot tosee all the minor movements of the parties but there was soon astruggle that could not be mistaken</s>  as the pottawattamie wasexamining the prisoner an exclamation that escaped him betrayed thesudden consciousness that the chippewa was unbound</s>  the sound was nosooner uttered than pigeonswing made a grasp at the sentinelsknife which however he did not obtain when the two closed andfell rolling down the declivity into the darkness</s>  when thepottawattamie seized the chippewa he uttered a yell whichinstantly brought every man of his party to his feet</s>  as the savagesnow united in the whoops and the dogs began to bark wildly aninfernal clamor was made</s> at first le bourdon did not know how to act</s>  he greatly feared thedogs and could not but think of margery and the probableconsequences should those sagacious animals follow him across themarsh</s>  but he did not like the idea of abandoning pigeonswing whena single blow of his arm or a kick of his foot might be the causeof his escape</s>  while deliberating in painful uncertainty the soundsof the struggle ceased and he saw the sentinel rising again intothe light limping like one who had suffered by a fall</s>  presently heheard a footstep near him and calling in a low voice he wasimmediately joined by pigeonswing</s>  before the beehunter was awareof his intention the chippewa seized his rifle and levelling atthe sentinel who still stood on the brow of the hill drawn in allhis savage outlines distinctly in the light of the flames he fired</s> the cry the leap into the air and the fall announced the unerringcharacter of the aim</s>  in coming to the earth the wounded man fellover the brow of the sharp acclivity and was heard rolling towardits base</s> le bourdon felt the importance of now improving the preciousmoments and was in the act of urging his companion to follow whenthe latter passed an arm around his body whipped his knife from thegirdle and sheath and dropping the rifle into his friends armsbounded away in the darkness taking the direction of his fallenenemy</s>  there was no mistaking all this chippewa led by his ownpeculiar sense of honor risking everything to obtain the usualtrophy of victory</s>  by this time a dozen of the savages stood on thebrow of the hill seemingly at a loss to understand what had becomeof the combatants</s>  perceiving this the beehunter profited by thedelay and reloaded his rifle</s>  as everything passed almost as swiftlyas the electric spark is known to travel it was but a moment afterthe pottawattamie fell ere his conqueror was through with his bloodytask</s>  just as le bourdon threw his rifle up into the hollow of hisarm he was rejoined by his red friend who bore the reeking scalpof the sentinel at his belt though fortunately the beehunter didnot see it on account of the obscurity else might he not have beenso willing to continue to act with so ruthless an ally</s> further stay was out of the question for the indians were nowcollected in a body on the brow of the hill where the chief wasrapidly issuing his orders</s>  in a minute the band dispersed everyman bounding into the darkness as if aware of the danger ofremaining within the influence of the bright light thrown from thefire</s>  then came such a clamor from the dogs as left no doubt in themind of the beehunter that they had scented and found the remainsof the fallen man</s>  a fierce yell came from the same spot the proofthat some of the savages had already discovered the body and lebourdon told his companion to follow taking his way across themarsh as fast as he could overcome the difficulties of the path</s> it has already been intimated that it was not easy if indeed itwere possible to cross that piece of low wet land in a direct line</s> there was tolerably firm ground on it but it lay in an irregularform its presence being generally to be noted by the growth oftrees</s>  le bourdon had been very careful in taking his landmarksforeseeing the probability of a hasty retreat and he had nodifficulty for some time in keeping in the right direction</s>  but thedogs soon left the dead body and came bounding across the marshdisregarding its difficulties though their plunges and yells soonmade it apparent that even they did not escape altogether with dryfeet</s>  as for the savages they poured down the declivity in astream taking the dogs as their guides and safe ones they mightwell be accounted so far as the scent was concerned though theydid not happen to be particularly well acquainted with all thedifficulties of the path</s> at length le bourdon paused causing his companion to stop also</s>  inthe hurry and confusion of the flight the former had lost hislandmarks finding himself amidst a copse of small trees or largebushes but not in the particular copse he sought</s>  every effort toget out of this thicket except by the way he had entered it provedabortive and the dogs were barking at no great distance in hisrear</s>  it is true that these animals no longer approached for theywere floundering in the mud and water but their throats answeredevery purpose to lead the pursuers on and the low calls that passedfrom mouth to mouth let the pursued understand that thepottawattamies were at their heels if not absolutely on theirtrail</s> the crisis demanded both discretion and decision qualities in whichthe beehunter with his forest training was not likely to bedeficient</s>  he looked out for the path by which he had reached theunfortunate thicket and having found it commenced a retreat by theway he had come</s>  nerve was needed to move almost in a line towardthe dogs and their masters but the nerve was forthcoming and thetwo advanced like veterans expecting the fire of some concealed butwellarmed battery</s>  presently le bourdon stopped and examined theground on which he stood</s> here we must turn chippewa he said in a guarded voice</s>  this isthe spot where i must have missed my way</s> good place to turn bout answered the indiandog too near</s> we must shoot the dogs if they press us too hard returned thebeehunter leading off rapidly now secure in the right direction</s> they seem to be in trouble just at this time but animals likethem will soon find their way across this marsh</s> bess shoot pottawattamie coolly returned pigeonswing</s> pottawattamie got capital scalpdogs ears no good for nutting anymore</s> yonder i believe is the tree i am in search of</s>  exclaimed lebourdon</s>  if we can reach that tree i think all will go well withus</s> the tree was reached and the beehunter proceeded to make sure ofhis course from that point</s>  removing from his pouch a small piece ofmoistened powder that he had prepared ere he liberated the chippewahe stuck it on a low branch of the tree he was under and on theside next the spot where he had stationed margery</s>  when this wasdone he made his companion stand aside and lighting some spunkwith his flint and steel he fired his powder</s>  of course thislittle preparation burned like the fireworks of a boy makingsufficient light however to be seen in a dark night for a mile ormore</s>  no sooner was the wetted powder hissing and throwing off itssparks than the beehunter gazed intently into the now seeminglytangible obscurity of the marsh</s>  a bright light appeared andvanished</s>  it was enough the beehunter threw down his own signaland extinguished it with his foot and as he wished the lantern ofmargery appeared no more</s>  assured now of the accuracy of hisposition as well as of the course he was to pursue le bourdon badehis companion follow and pressed anew across the marsh</s>  a tree wassoon visible and toward that particular object the fugitivessteadily pressed until it was reached</s>  at the next instant margerywas joined and the beehunter could not refrain from kissing herin the excess of his pleasure</s> there is a dreadful howling of dogs said margery feeling nooffence at the liberty taken in a moment like that and it seemsto me that a whole tribe is following at their heels</s>  for heavenssake bourdon let us hasten to the canoes brother and sister mustthink us lost</s> the circumstances pressed and the beehunter took margerys armpassing it through one of his own with a decided and protectingmanner that caused the girls heart to beat with emotions not inthe least connected with fear leaving an impression of pleasureeven at that perilous moment</s>  as the distance was not great thethree were soon on the beach and near to the canoes</s>  here they metdorothy alone and pacing to and fro like a person distressed</s>  shehad doubtless heard the clamor and was aware that the savages wereout looking for their party</s>  as margery met her sister she saw thatsomething more than common had gone wrong and in the eagerness ofher apprehensions she did not scruple about putting her questions</s> what has become of brother</s>  where is gershom</s>  demanded thesensitive girl at once</s> the answer was given in a low voice and in that sort of manner withwhich woman struggles to the last to conceal the delinquencies ofhim she loves</s> gershom is not himself just now half whispered the wifehe hasfallen into one of his old ways agin</s> old ways</s>  slowly repeated the sister dropping her own voice totones similar to those in which the unpleasant news had just beencommunicated</s>  how is that possible now that all the whiskey isemptied</s> it seems that bourdon had a jug of brandy among his stores andgershom found it out</s>  i blame no one for bourdon who never abusesthe gifts of providence had a right to his comforts at least butit is a pity that there was anything of the sort in the canoes</s> the beehunter was greatly concerned at this unwelcome intelligencefeeling all its importance far more vividly than either of hiscompanions</s>  they regretted as women but he foresaw the danger as aman accustomed to exertion in trying scenes</s>  if whiskey centre hadreally fallen into his old ways so as to render himself anincumbrance instead of being an assistant at such a moment thefact was to be deplored but it could only be remedied by time</s> luckily they had the indian with them and he could manage one ofthe canoes while he himself took charge of the other</s>  as no timewas to be lostthe barking of the dogs and the cries of the savagestoo plainly letting it be known that the enemy was getting throughthe marsh by some means or otherhe hurried the party down to thecanoes entering that of whiskey centre at once</s> le bourdon found gershom asleep but with the heavy slumbers of thedrunkard</s>  dolly had removed the jug and concealed it as soon as thestate of her husband enabled her to do so without incurring hisviolence</s>  else might the unfortunate man have destroyed himself byindulging in a liquor so much more palatable than that he wasaccustomed to use after so long and compelled an abstinence</s>  thejug was now produced however and le bourdon emptied it in theriver to the great joy of the two females though not without asharp remonstrance from the chippewa</s>  the beehunter was steady andthe last drop of the liquor of gascony was soon mingling with thewaters of the kalamazoo</s>  this done the beehunter desired the womento embark and called to the chippewa to do the same</s>  by quittingthe spot in the canoes it was evident the pursuers would be balkedtemporarily at least since they must recross the marsh in order toget into their own boats without which further pursuit would befruitless</s> it might have been by means of a secret sympathy or it was possiblythe result of accident but certain it is that the chippewa wasplaced in that of le bourdon</s>  as for whiskey centre he lay like alog in the bottom of his own light bark cared for only by hisaffectionate wife who had made a pillow for his head butfortunately if no assistance just then not any material hindranceto the movements of his friends</s>  by the time le bourdon and thechippewa had got their stations and the canoes were free of thebottom it was evident by the sounds that not only the dogs butdivers of their masters had floundered through the swamp and werealready on the firm ground east of it</s>  as the dogs ran by scentlittle doubt remained of their soon leading the savages to the placeof embarkation</s>  aware of this the beehunter directed the chippewato follow and urged his own canoe away from the shore followingone of three of the natural channels that united just at that point</s> the clamor now sensibly increased and the approach of the pursuerswas much faster than it had previously been in consequence of thereno longer being wet land beneath their feet</s>  at the distance offifty yards from the shore however the channel or open avenueamong the riceplants that the canoes had taken made a short turnto the northward for all the events we have just been recordingoccurred on the northern or leeward side of the river</s>  once aroundthis bend in the channel the canoes would have been effectuallyconcealed from those on the beach had it even been broad daylightand of course were so much more hidden from view under theobscurity of a very dark night</s>  perceiving this and fearful thatthe dip of the paddles might be heard le bourdon ceased to urge hiscanoe through the water telling the chippewa to imitate hisexample and let the boats drift</s>  in consequence of this precautionthe fugitives were still quite near the shore when first the dogsthen a party of their masters came rushing down to the very spotwhence the canoes had departed scarcely two minutes before</s>  as noprecautions were taken to conceal the advance of the pursuers thepursued or the individuals among them who alone understood thecommon language of the great ojebway nation well had an opportunityof hearing and understanding all that was said</s>  le bourdon hadbrought the two canoes together and the chippewa at his requestnow translated such parts of the discourse of their enemies as hedeemed worthy of communicating to the females</s> say now nobody dere</s>  commenced the indian coolly</s>  tink he nogreat way offmean to look for himtink dog uneasywoner whydog so uneasy</s> them dogs are very likely to scent us here in

motion</s>  thedarkness might now have been a sufficient protection had there beenno rice but the plant would have concealed the movement even atnoonday</s>  the fire in the hut served as a beacon and enabled lebourdon to find the canoes</s>  when he reached the landing he couldstill hear the dogs barking on the marsh and the voices of thosewith them calling in loud tones to two of the savages who hadremained at the chiente as a sort of campguard</s> what do them chaps say</s>  asked le bourdon of the chippewa</s>  theyyell as if striving to make the two men at the door of the hut hearthem</s>

shot</s>  shove offchippewa and paddle at once for the middle of the bay</s> as le bourdon was much in earnest pigeonswing was fain to comply</s> had the last possessed a rifle of his own or even a knife it ishighly probable he would have leaped ashore and found the means ofstealing on some of his enemies unawares and thus secured anothertrophy</s>  but the beehunter was determined and the chippewa howeverreluctant was compelled to obey for not only had le bourdon kepthis rifle at his side but he had used the precaution of securinghis knife and tomahawk both of which he carried habitually thesame as a red man</s> the canoes had now a somewhat difficult task</s>  the wind still blewfresh and it was necessary for one of these light craft prettywell loaded with its proper freight and paddled by only a singleperson to tow two other craft of equal size dead to the windward</s> the weight in the towing craft and the lightness of those that weretowed rendered this task however easier than it might otherwisehave proved</s>  in the course of a couple of minutes all the canoeswere far enough from the shore to be out of sight of the twoindians who by that time had got down to the beach to look aftertheir own craft</s>  the yell these savages raised on finding themselvestoo late not only announced their disappointment but communicatedthe extent of the disaster to their friends who were stillfloundering through the marsh</s> the great advantage that the party of the beehunter had nowobtained must be very apparent to all</s>  in possession of all thecanoes their enemies were or would be for some time at leastconfined to the northern side of the river which was so wide nearits mouth as to present an effectual barrier between them and thosewho occupied the opposite bank</s>  the canoes also enabled the weakerparty to change their position at will carrying with them as manyeffects as were on board and which included the whole of theproperty of le bourdon while their loss deprived their enemies ofall extra means of motion and would be very likely to induce themto proceed on their expedition by land</s>  the objects of thatexpedition could only be conjectured by the beehunter until he hadquestioned the chippewa a thing he did not fail to do so soon ashe believed the party quite safe under the south shore</s>  here thefugitives landed proceeding up a natural channel in the wild ricein order to do so and selecting a bit of dry beach for theirpurpose</s>  margery set about lighting a fire in order to keep themosquitos at a distance selecting a

come in a canoe from the mouth of the st</s>  josephs to apoint about halfway between that river and the mouth of thekalamazoo and there landed</s>  what the object of the party was doesnot exactly appear though it is far from being certain that it wasnot to seize the beehunter and confiscate his effects</s>  although lebourdon was personally a stranger to elksfoot news flies throughthe wilderness in an extraordinary manner and it was not at allunlikely that the fact of a white americans being in the openingsshould soon spread along with the tidings that the hatchet was dugup and that a party should go out in quest of his scalp and theplunder</s>  it would seem that the savage tact of the chippewa detectedthat in the manner of the pottawattamie chief which assured him theintentions of the old warrior were not amicable and that he tookthe very summary process which has been related not only to securehis scalp but effectually to put it out of his power to do anymischief to one who was an ally and by means of recent confidencenow a friend</s>  all this the indian explained to his companion in hisusual clipped english but with a clearness sufficient to make itperfectly intelligible to his listener</s>  the beehunter listened withthe most profound attention for he was fully aware of theimportance of comprehending all the hazards of his own situation</s> while this dialogue was going on margery had succeeded in lightingher fire and was busy in preparing some warm compound which sheknew would be required by her unhappy brother after his debauchdorothy passed often between the fire and the canoe feeling awifes anxiety in the fate of her husband</s>  as for the chippewaintoxication was a very venial offence in his eyes though he had acontempt for a man who would thus indulge while on a warpath</s>  theamerican indian does possess this merit of adapting his deportmentto his circumstances</s>  when engaged in war he usually prepareshimself in the coolest and wisest manner to meet its strugglesindulging only in moments of leisure and of comparative security</s> it is true that the march of what is called civilization is fastchanging the red mans character and he is very apt now to do thatwhich he sees done by the christians around him</s> le bourdon when his dialogue with the chippewa was over and aftera few words of explanation with margery took his own canoe andpaddled through the riceplants into the open water of the river toreconnoitre</s>  the breadth of the stream induced him to float downbefore the wind until he reached a point where he could againcommand a view of the hut</s>  what he there saw and what he next didmust be reserved for a succeeding chapter</s> chapter viii</s>   the elfin cast a glance around  as he lighted down from his courser toad  then round his breast his wings he wound  and close to the rivers brink he strode  he sprang on a rock he breathed a prayer  above his head his arm he threw  then tossed a tiny curve in air  and headlong plunged in the water blue</s>         drake</s> an hour had intervened between the time when le bourdon had removedthe canoes of the pottawattamies and the time when he returnedalone to the northern side of the river</s>  in the course of that hourthe chief of the savages had time to ascertain all the leadingcircumstances that have just been related and to collect his peoplein and around the hut for a passing council</s>  the moment was one ofaction and not of ceremonies</s>  no pipe was smoked nor any of theobservances of the great councils of the tribe attended to theobject was merely to glean facts and to collect opinions</s>  in all thetribes of this part of north america something very like aprinciple of democracy is the predominant feature of their politics</s> it is not however that bastard democracy which is coming so muchin fashion among ourselves and which looks into the gutters solelyfor the people forgetting that the landlord has just as muchright to protection as the tenant the master as the servant therich as the poor the gentleman as the blackguard</s>  the indians knowbetter than all this</s>  they understand fully that the chiefs areentitled to more respect than the loafers in their villages andlisten to the former while their ears are shut to the latter</s>  theyappear to have a common sense which teaches them to avoid equallythe exaggerations of those who believe in blood and of those whobelieve in blackguardism</s>  with them the doctrines of new men wouldsound as an absurdity for they never submit to change for changessake</s>  on the contrary while there is no positive hereditary rankthere is much hereditary consideration and we doubt if a red mancould be found in all america who is so much of a simpleton as tocite among the qualifications of any man for a situation of trustand responsibility that he had never been taught how to perform itsduties</s>  they are not guilty of the contradiction of elevating menbecause they are selftaught while they expend millions on schools</s> doubtless they have after a fashion of their own demagogues andcaesars but they are usually kept within moderate limits and inrare instances indeed do either ever seriously trespass on therights of the tribe</s>  as human nature is everywhere the same it isnot to be supposed that pure justice prevails even among savagesbut one thing would seem to be certain that all over the worldman in his simplest and wildest state is more apt to respect his ownordinances than when living in what is deemed a condition of highcivilization</s> when le bourdon reached the point whence he could get a good view ofthe door of the hut which was still illuminated by the fire withinhe ceased using the paddle beyond the slight effort necessary tokeep the canoe nearly stationary</s>  he was quite within the range of arifle but trusted to the darkness of the night for his protection</s> that scouts were out watching the approaches to the hut he feltsatisfied and he did not doubt that some were prowling along themargin of the kalamazoo either looking for the lost boats or forthose who had taken them away</s>  this made him cautious and he tookgood care not to place his canoe in a position of danger</s> it was very apparent that the savages were in great uncertainty asto the number of their enemies</s>  had not the rifle been fired andtheir warrior killed and scalped they might have supposed thattheir prisoner had found the means of releasing his limbs himselfand thus effected his escape but they knew that the chippewa hadneither gun nor knife and as all their own arms even to those ofthe dead man were still in their possession it was clear that hehad been succored from without</s>  now the pottawattamies had heard ofboth the beehunter and whiskey centre and it was natural enoughfor them to ascribe some of these unlookedfor feats to one or theother of these agents</s>  it is true the hut was known to have beenbuilt three or four years earlier by an indian trader and no oneof the party had ever actually seen gershom and his family inpossession but the conjectures on this head were as near the factas if the savages had passed and repassed daily</s>  there was only onepoint on which these close calculators of events were at fault</s>  sothoroughly had everything been removed from the chiente and socarefully the traces of its recent occupation concealed that no oneamong them suspected that the family had left the place only an hourbefore their own arrival</s>  the beehunter moreover was well assuredthat the savages had not yet blundered on the hidingplace of thefurniture</s>  had this been discovered its contents would have beendragged to light and seen around the fire for there is usuallylittle selfrestraint among the red men when they make a prize ofthis sort</s> nevertheless there was one point about which even those keenscented children of the forest were much puzzled and which the beehunter perfectly comprehended notwithstanding the distance at whichhe was compelled to keep himself</s>  the odor of the whiskey was sostrong in and about the chiente that the pottawattamies did notknow what to make of it</s>  that there should be the remains of thispeculiar smellone so fragrant and tempting to those who areaccustomed to indulge in the liquorin the hut itself was naturalenough but the savages were perplexed at finding it so strong onthe declivity down which the barrels had been rolled</s>  on thissubject were they conversing when le bourdon first got near enoughto observe their proceedings</s>  after discussing the matter for sometime torches were lighted and most of the party followed a grimold warrior who had an exceedingly true nose for the scent ofwhiskey and who led them to the very spot where the halfbarrel hadbeen first stove by rolling off a rock and where its contents hadbeen mainly spilled</s>  here the earth was yet wet in places and thescent was so strong as to leave no doubt of the recent nature of theaccident which had wasted so much of a liquor that was very preciousin pottawattamie eyes for accident they thought it must be sinceno sane man could think of destroying the liquor intentionally</s> all the movements gestures and genuflections of the savages wereplainly seen by the beehunter</s>  we say the genuflections for nearlyall of the indians got on their knees and applied their noses to theearth in order to scent the fragrance of the beloved whiskey someout of curiosity but more because they loved even this tantalizingindulgence when no better could be had</s>  but le bourdon was right inhis conjectures that the matter was not to end here</s>  although mostof the indians scented the remains of the whiskey out of love forthe liquor a few of their number reasoned on the whole transactionwith quite as much acuteness as could have been done by theshrewdest natural philosopher living</s>  to them it was very apparentthat no great length of time a few hours at most could haveelapsed since that whiskey was spilled and human hands must havebrought it there in the first place and poured it on the groundin the second</s>  there must have been a strong reason for such an actand that reason presented itself to their minds with unerringaccuracy</s>  their own approach must have been seen and the liquor wasdestroyed because it could not be removed in time to prevent itsfalling into their hands</s>  even the precise manner in which thewhiskey had been disposed of was pretty nearly conjectured by a fewof the chiefs acute and practised as they were who accustomed tothis species of exercise of their wits had some such dexterity inexamining facts of this nature and in arriving at just results asthe men of the schools manifest in the inquiries that moreespecially belong to their habits and training</s>  but theirconclusions were confined to themselves and they were alsosufficiently enveloped in doubts to leave those who made them readyenough to receive new impressions on the same subject</s> all this moreover le bourdon both saw and understood or if notabsolutely all so much of it as to let him comprehend the mainconclusions of the savages as well as the process by which theywere reached</s>  to obtain light the indians made a fire near thecharmed spot which brought themselves and their movements intoplain view from the canoe of the beehunter</s>  curiosity now becamestrongly awakened in the latter and he ventured in nearer to theshore in order to get the best possible view of what was going on</s> in a manner he was solving an enigma and he experienced the sortof pleasure we all feel at exercising our wits on difficulties ofthat nature</s>  the interest he felt rendered the young man careless asrespected the position of his canoe which drifted down before thestrong breeze until le bourdon found himself in the very edge ofthe wild rice which at this point formed but a very narrow beltalong the beach</s>  it was this plant indeed that contributed to makethe young man so regardless of his drift for he looked upon thebelt of rice as a species of landmark to warn him when to turn</s>  butat no other spot along that whole shore where the plant was to befound at all was its belt so narrow as at this immediatelyopposite to the new fire of the savages and almost within theinfluence of its rays</s>  to le bourdons surprise and somewhat to hisconsternation just as his little craft touched the rice the formsof two stout warriors passed along the beach between him and thelight their feet almost dipping in the water</s>  so near were thesetwo warriors to him that on listening intently he heard not onlytheir voices as they communicated their thoughts to each other inlow tones but the tread of their moccasined feet on the ground</s> retreat under the circumstances would not be safe for it musthave been made under the muzzles of the rifles and but one resourcepresented itself</s>  by grasping in his hand two or three stalks of thericeplant and holding them firmly the drift of the canoe wasarrested</s> after a moments reflection le bourdon was better satisfied withthis new station than he had been on first gaining it</s>  to haveventured on such a near approach to his enemies he would haveregarded as madness but now he was there well concealed among therice he enjoyed the advantages of observation it gave him andlooked upon the chance that brought him there as lucky</s>  he found athong of buckskin and fastened his canoe to the stalks of theplant thus anchoring or mooring his little bark and leavinghimself at liberty to move about in it</s>  the rice was high enough toconceal him even when erect and he had some difficulty in findingplaces favorable to making his observations through it</s>  when thebeehunter made his way into the bow of his canoe however which hedid with a moccasined and noiseless foot he was startled atperceiving how small was his cover</s>  in point of fact he was nowwithin three feet of the inner edge of the riceplant which grewwithin ten feet of the shore where the two warriors alreadymentioned were still standing in close communication with eachother</s>  their faces were turned toward the fire the bright lightfrom which at times streamed over the canoe itself in a way toillumine all it contained</s>  the first impulse of le bourdon onascertaining how closely he had drifted to the shore was to seize apaddle and make off but a second thought again told him it would befar safer to remain where he was</s>  taking his seat therefore on abit of board laid athwart from gunwale to gunwale if such a craftcan be said to have gunwales at all he patiently waited the courseof events</s> by this time all or nearly all of the pottawattamies had collectedon this spot on the side of the hill</s>  the hut was deserted itsfire got to be low and darkness reigned around the place</s>  on theother hand the indians kept piling brush on their new fire untilthe whole of that hillside the stream at its foot and the ravinethrough which the latter ran were fairly illuminated</s>  of courseall within the influence of this light was to be distinctly seenand the beehunter was soon absorbed in gazing at the movements ofsavage enemies under circumstances so peculiar</s> the savages seemed to be entranced by the singular and to most ofthem unaccountable circumstance of the earths giving forth thescent of fresh whiskey in a place so retired and unknown</s>  while twoor three of their number had certain inklings of the truth as hasbeen stated to much the greater portion of their body it appearedto be a profound mystery and one that in some inexplicable mannerwas connected with the recent digging up of the hatchet</s>  ignoranceand superstition ever go hand in hand and it was natural that manyperhaps most of these uninstructed beings should thus consider sounusual a fragrance on such a spot</s>  whiskey has unfortunatelyobtained a power over the red man of this continent that it wouldrequire many fathers matthew to suppress and which can only belikened to that which is supposed to belong to the influence ofwitchcraft</s>  the indian is quite as sensible as the white man of themischief that the firewater produces but like the white man hefinds how hard it is to get rid of a master passion when we haveonce submitted ourselves to its sway</s>  the portion of the band thatcould not account for the fact of the scent of their belovedbeverages being found in such a place and it was all but three oftheir whole party were quite animated in their discussions on thesubject and many and crude were the suggestions that fell fromtheir lips</s>  the two warriors on the beach were more deeply impressedthan any of their companions with the notion that some medicinecharm was connected with this extraordinary affair</s> the reader will not be surprised to hear that le bourdon gazed onthe scene before him with the most profound attention</s>  so near didhe seem to be and so near was he in fact to the savages who weregrouped around the fire that he fancied he could comprehend whatthey were saying by the expressions of their grim and swarthycountenances</s>  his conjectures were in part just and occasionallythe beehunter was absolutely accurate in his notions of what wassaid</s>  the frequency with which different individuals knelt on theground to scent an odor that is always so pleasant to the red manwould of itself have given a clew to the general character of thediscourse but the significant and expressive gestures the rapidenunciation and the manner in which the eyes of the speakersglanced from the faces near themselves to the spot consecrated bywhiskey pretty plainly told the story</s>  it was while thus intentlyoccupied in endeavoring to read the singular impression made on theminds of most of those wild beings by an incident so much out ofthe usual track of their experience that le bourdon suddenly foundthe bow of his canoe thrusting itself beyond the inner margin of therice and issuing into open water within ten feet of the very spotwhere the two nearest of the savages were still conferring togetherapart</s>  the buckskin thong which served as a fastening had gotloosened and the light craft was again drifting down before thestrong southerly wind which still continued to blow a little gale</s> had there been an opportunity for such a thing the beehunter wouldhave made an effort to escape</s>  but so sudden and unexpected was thisexposure that he found himself almost within reach of a riflebefore he was aware of his approaching the two warriors on theshore at all</s>  his paddle was in the stern of the canoe and had heused the utmost activity the boat would have grounded on the beachere he could have obtained it</s>  in this situation therefore he wasabsolutely without any other means than his hands of stopping thecanoe had there even been time</s> le bourdon understood his real situation without stopping toreflect and though his heart made one violent leap as soon as heperceived he was out of cover he immediately bethought him of thecourse he ought to pursue</s>  it would have been fatal to betray alarmor to attempt flight</s>  as accident had thus brought him as it mightbe on a visit to the spot he at once determined to give hisarrival the character of a friendly call and the better to supportthe pretension to blend with it if possible a little of theoracular or medicine manner in order to impose on theimaginations of the superstitious beings into whose power he had sounwittingly fallen</s> the instant the canoe touched the shore and it was only a momentafter it broke through the cover le bourdon arose and extendinghis hand to the nearest indian saluted him with the mongrel term ofsago</s>  a slight exclamation from this warrior communicated to hiscompanion an arrival that was quite as much a matter of surprise tothe indians as to their guest and through this second warrior tothe whole party on the hillside</s>  a little clamor succeeded andpresently the beehunter was surrounded with savages</s> the meeting was marked by the selfcommand and dignified quiet thatare so apt to distinguish the deportment of indian warriors whenthey are on the warpath and alive to the duties of manhood</s>  thebeehunter shook hands with several who received his salutationswith perfect calmness if not with absolute confidence and amity</s> this little ceremony gave our hero an opportunity to observe theswarthy countenances by which he was surrounded most of which werefierce in their paint as well as to reflect a little on his owncourse</s>  by a fortunate inspiration he now determined to assume thecharacter of a medicine man and to connect his prophecies andjuggleries with this lucky accident of the whiskey</s>  accordingly heinquired if any one spoke english not wishing to trust hisexplanations to his own imperfect knowledge of the ojebway tonguewhich is spoken by all the numerous tribes of that widelyextendednation</s>  several could render themselves intelligible in english andone was so expert as to render communication with him easy if notvery agreeable</s>  as the savages however soon insisted on examiningthe canoe and taking a look at its contents previously tolistening to their visitors explanations le bourdon was fain tosubmit and to let the young men satisfy their curiosity</s> the beehunter had come on his hazardous expedition in his owncanoe</s>  previously to quitting the south shore however he hadlightened the little craft by landing everything that was notessential to his present purpose</s>  as nearly half of his effects werein the canoe of whiskey centre the task was soon performed andlucky it was for our hero that he had bethought him of the prudenceof the measure</s>  his sole object had been to render the canoe swifterand lighter in the event of a chase but as things turned out hesaved no small portion of his property by using the precaution</s>  theindians found nothing in the canoe but one rifle with a horn andpouch a few light articles belonging to the beehunters domesticeconomy and which he had not thought it necessary to remove andthe paddles</s>  all the honey and the skins and stores and sparepowder and lead and in short everything else that belonged to lebourdon was still safe on the other side of the river</s>  the greatestadvantage gained by the pottawattamies was in the possession of thecanoe itself by means of which they would now be enabled to crossthe kalamazoo or make any other similar expedition by water</s> but as yet not a sign of hostility was betrayed by either party</s> the beehunter seemed to pay no attention to his rifle andammunition or even to his canoe while the savages after havingwarily examined the last together with its contents returned totheir visitor to reexamine him with a curiosity as lively as itwas full of distrust</s>  at this stage in the proceeding somethinglike a connected and intelligible conversation commenced between thechief who spoke english and who was known in most of the northwestern garrisons of the americans by the name of thundercloud orcloud by way of abbreviation on account of his sinister looksthough the man actually sustained a tolerably fair reputation forone of those who having been wronged was so certain to

oracularlike language and manner of thebeehunter</s>  he intended to make an impression on his listeners andhe succeeded admirably perhaps as much by means of manner as ofmatter</s>  as has been said all who understood his wordssome four orfive of the partygrunted forth their surprise at this evidence oftheir guests acquaintance with the secrets of the place in whichthey were joined by the rest of their companions as soon as thewords of the paleface had been translated</s>  even the experienced andwary old chiefs who had more than half conjectured the truth inconnection with this mysterious odor of whiskey were much unsettledin their opinions concerning the wonder and got to be in thatcondition of mind when a man does not know what to think of anyparticular event</s>  the beehunter quickwitted and managing for hislife was not slow to perceive the advantage he had gained and heproceeded at once to clinch the nail he had so skilfully driven</s> turning from cloud to the headchief of the party a warrior whom hehad no difficulty in recognizing after having so long watched hismovements in the earlier part of the night he pushed the samesubject a little further</s> yes this place is called by the whites whiskey centre he addedwhich means that it is the centre of all the whiskey of the countryround about</s> dat true said cloud quicklyi hear soger at fort dearborncall him

truth of what i tell you</s>  come with me and i will tell youwhere to dig in the morning for a whiskey spring</s> this communication excited a tremendous feeling among the savageswhen its purport came to be explained to the whole party</s>  apart fromthe extraordinary miraculous nature of such a spring which initself was sufficient to keep alive expectation and gratifycuriosity it was so comfortable to have an inexhaustible supply ofthe liquor running out of the bowels of the earth that it is nowonder the news spread infinite delight among the listeners</s>  eventhe two or three of the chiefs who had so shrewdly divined themanner in which the liquor had been spilled were staggered by thesolemnity and steadiness of the beehunters manner and perhaps alittle carried away by sympathy with those around them</s>  thisyielding of the human mind to the influence of numbers is so commonan occurrence as scarcely to require explanation and is the sourceof half the evils that popular associations inflict on themselves</s> it is not that men capable of seeing the truth are ever wanting butmen capable of maintaining it in the face of clamor and collectedpower</s> it will be readily conceived that a medicineman who is supposed topossess the means of discovering a spring that should overflow withpure whiskey would not be left without urgent demands for a speedyexercise of this art</s>  this was now the case with le bourdon who wascalled on from all sides to point out the precise spot where theyoung men were to commence digging in order to open on the treasure</s> our hero knew that his only hope of escape was connected with hissteadily maintaining his assumed character or of maintaining thisassumed character with his going on at once to do something thatmight have the effect temporarily at least of satisfying theimpatience of his now attentive listeners</s>  accordingly when thedemand was made on him to give some evidence of his power he setabout the task not only with composure but with a good deal ofingenuity</s> le bourdon it will be remembered had with his own hands rolledthe two barrels of whiskey down the declivity</s>  feeling the greatimportance of effectually destroying them he had watched theirdescent from the top to the bottom of the hill and the finaldisappearance of the staves etc</s>  into the torrent which brawled atits foot</s>  it had so happened that the halffilled cask broke and letout its liquor at a point much more remote from the stream than thefilled</s>  the latter had held together until it went over the lowrocky precipice already mentioned and was stove at its basewithin two yards of the torrent which received all its fragmentsand swept them away including most of the liquor itself but notuntil the last had been spilled</s>  now the odorous spot which hadattracted the noses of the savages and near which they had builttheir fire was that where the smallest quantity of the whiskey hadfallen</s>  le bourdon reasoned on these circumstances in this wiseifhalf a barrel of the liquor can produce so strong a scent a barrelfilled ought to produce one still stronger and i will manifest mymedicinecharacter by disregarding for the present moment the spoton the hillside and proceed at once to that at the foot of therocks</s>  to this latter point therefore did he direct all theceremony as well as his own footsteps when he yielded to thesolicitations of the pottawattamies and undertook to point out theposition of the whiskey spring</s> the beehunter understood the indian character too well to forget toembellish his work with a proper amount of jugglery and acting</s> luckily he had left in the canoe a sort of frock of mottled colorsthat he had made himself to wear in the woods in the autumn as ahuntingdress under the notion that such a covering would concealhis approach from his game by blending its hues with those of theautumn leaf</s>  this dress he now assumed extorting a good deal ofhalfsuppressed admiration from the younger warriors by the gayappearance he made</s>  then he drew out his spyglass to its greatestlength making various mysterious signs and gestures as he did so</s> this glass proved to be a great auxiliary and possibly alone keptthe doubters in awe</s>  le bourdon saw at once that it was entirelynew even to the oldest chief and he felt how much it might be madeto assist him</s>  beckoning to cloud and adjusting the focus hedirected the small end of his glass to the fire and placed thelarge end to that indians eye</s>  a solitary savage who loved thescent of whiskey too much to tear himself away from the spot waslingering within the influence of the rays and of course was seenby the chief with his person diminished to that of a dwarf and hisform thrown to a seeming distance</s> an eloquent exclamation followed this exhibition of the medicinemans power and each of the chiefs and most of the other warriorswere gratified with looks through the glass</s> what dat mean</s>  demanded cloud earnestly</s>  see wolfeye wellnoughwhy he so little</s> why he so far off he</s> that is to show you what a medicineman of the palefaces can dowhen he is so minded</s>  that indian is named wolfseye and he loveswhiskey too well</s>  that i know as well as i know his name</s> each of these exhibitions of intelligence extorted exclamations ofwonder</s>  it is true that one or two of the higher chiefs understoodthat the name might possibly have been obtained from cloud but howwas the medicineman to know that wolfseye was a drunkard</s>  this lasthad not been said in terms but enough had been said to let thosewho were aware of the propensity feel that more was meant than hadbeen expressed</s>  before there was time however to deliberate on orto dissect this specimen of mysterious knowledge le bourdonreversed the glass and applied the small end to the eye of cloudafter having given it its former direction</s>  the indian

ix</s> he turned him round and fled amain with hurry and dash to the beachagain he twisted over from side to side and laid his cheek to thecleaving tide the strokes of his plunging arms are fleet and withall his might he flings his feet but the watersprites are roundhim still to cross his path and work him ill</s>        the culprit fay</s> the first step in the conjuration of the beehunter was to producean impression on the minds of his untutored observers by resortingto a proper amount of mummery and mystical action</s>  this he wasenabled to do with some effect in consequence of having practisedas a lad in similar mimicry by way of pastime</s>  the germans and thedescendants of germans in america are not of a very high class asrespects education taken as a body and they retain many of themost inveterate of the superstitions of their teutonic ancestors</s> although the beehunter himself was of purely english descent hecame from a state that was in part peopled by these germans andtheir descendants and by intercourse with them he had acquired acertain knowledge of their notions on the subject of necromancythat he now found was of use</s>  so far as gravity of mien solemngrimaces and unintelligible mutterings were concerned le bourdonplayed his part to admiration and by the time he had led the partyhalf the distance he intended to go our necromancer or medicineman had complete possession of the imaginations of all thesavages the two or three chiefs already mentioned alone excepted</s> at this stage of the proceedings occurred a little incident whichgoes to prove the disposition of the common mind to contribute indeceiving itself and which was of considerable assistance to lebourdon in maintaining his assumed character</s> it will be remembered that the place where the indians had foundtheir strongest scent was on the hillside or the spot where thehalffilled barrel had let out most of its contents</s>  near this spottheir new fire was still brightly blazing and there wolfseyeremained regaling one of his senses at least with an odor that hefound so agreeable</s>  but the beehunter knew that he should greatlyincrease the wonder of the savages by leading them to a new scentspot one to which there was no visible clew and where the odor wasprobably much stronger than on the hillside</s>  accordingly he did notapproach the fire but kept around the base of the hill just enoughwithin the influence of the light to pick his way readily and yetso distant from it as to render his countenance indistinct andmysterious</s>  no sooner however had he got abreast of the scentspotknown to the savages than the crowd endeavored to lead him towardit by gestures and hints and finally by direct intimations thathe was going astray</s>  all this our medicineman disregarded heheld his way steadily and solemnly toward that place at the foot ofthe hill where he knew that the filled barrel had let out itscontents and where he reasonably enough expected to findsufficient traces of the whiskey to answer his purposes</s>  at firstthis pertinacity provoked the crowd which believed he was goingwrong but a few words from crowsfeather the principal chiefcaused the commotion to cease</s>  in a few more minutes le bourdonstopped near the place of his destination</s>  as a fresh scent ofwhiskey was very perceptible here a murmur of admiration notunmixed with delight passed among the attendants</s> now let the young men build a fire for me said the beehuntersolemnlynot such a fire as that which is burning on the hill buta medicinefire</s>  i smell the whiskey spring and want a medicinelight to see it</s> a dozen young men began to collect the brush in a minute a pile ofsome size had been accumulated on a flat rock within twenty feet ofthe spot where le bourdon knew that the cask had been dashed topieces</s>  when he thought the pile sufficiently large he toldcrowsfeather that it might be lighted by bringing a brand from theother fire</s> this will not be a medicinelight for that can come only frommedicinematches he added but i want a fire to see the shapeof the ground</s>  put in the brand brothers let us have a flame</s> the desire of the beehunter was gratified and the whole of thebase of the hill around the spot where the filled cask had brokenwas illuminated</s> now let all the pottawattamies stand back added le bourdonearnestly</s>  it might cost a warrior his life to come forward toosoonor if not his life it might give a rheumatism that can neverbe cured which is worse</s>  when it is time for my red brothers toadvance they will be called</s> as the beehunter accompanied this announcement by suitablegestures he succeeded in ranging all of the silent but excitedsavages on three sides of his fire leaving that next his mysteriousspring to himself alone</s>  when all was arranged le bourdon movedslowly but unaccompanied to the precise spot where the cask hadbroken</s>  here he found the odor of the whiskey so strong as toconvince him that some of the liquor must yet remain</s>  on examiningmore closely he ascertained that several shallow cavities of theflat rock on which the cask had been dashed still contained a gooddeal of the liquor enough to prove of great assistance to hismedicine character</s> all this while the beehunter kept one portion of his faculties onthe alert in order to effect his escape</s>  that he might deceive fora time aided as he was by so many favorable circumstances he didnot doubt but he dreaded the morning and the results of a night ofreflection and rest</s>  crowsfeather in particular troubled him andhe foresaw that his fate would be terrible did the savages once getan inkling of the deception he was practising</s>  as he stood therebending over the little pools of whiskey he glanced his eyes towardthe gloom which pervaded the northern side of the hill andcalculated the chances of escape by trusting to his speed</s>  all ofthe pottawattamies were on the opposite side and there was athicket favorably placed for a cover so near that the rifle wouldscarce have time to perform its fatal office ere he might hope tobury himself within its leaves</s>  so tempting did the occasion appearthat for a single instant le bourdon forgot his caution and hismummeries and had actually advanced a step or two in the directiontoward which he contemplated flight when on glancing an uneasylook behind him he perceived crowsfeather and his two intimatecounsellors stealthily preparing their rifles as if they distrustedhis intentions</s>  this at once induced a change of plan and broughtthe beehunter back to a sense of his critical position and of theindispensable necessity of caution to a man in his situation</s> le bourdon now seemingly gave all his attention to the rocks wherehe stood and out of which the muchcoveted liquor was expected toflow though his thoughts were still busily employed in consideringthe means of escape the whole time</s>  while stooping over thedifferent pools and laying his plans for continuing his medicinecharms the beehunter saw how near he had been to committing agreat mistake</s>  it was almost as indispensable to carry off thecanoe as it was to carry off himself since with the canoe notonly would all his own property but pretty margery and gershom andhis wife be at the mercy of the pottawattamies whereas bysecuring the boat the wide kalamazoo would serve as a nearlyimpassable barrier until time was given to the whites to escape</s> his whole plan was changed by this suggestion and he no longerthought of the thicket and of flight inland</s>  at the same time thatthe bee hunter was laying up in his mind ideas so important to hisfuture movements he did not neglect the necessary examination ofthe means that might be required to extend and prolong his influenceover the minds of the superstitious children of the forest on whomhe was required to practise his arts</s>  his thoughts reverted to thecanoe and he concocted a plan by which he believed it possible toget possession of his little craft again</s>  once on board it by onevigorous shove he fancied he might push it within the cover of thericeplants where he would be in reasonable safety against thebullets of the savages</s>  could he only get the canoe on the outerside of the narrow belt of the plant he should deem himself safe</s> having arranged his course in his own mind le bourdon now beckonedto crowsfeather to draw near at the same time inviting the wholeparty to approach within a few feet of the spot where he himselfstood</s>  the beehunter had brought with him from the boat a fragmentof the larger end of a cane fishingrod which he used as a sort ofwand</s>  its size was respectable and its length about eight feet</s> with this wand he pointed out the different objects he named and itanswered the very important purpose of enabling him to make certainsmall changes in the formation of the ground that were of thegreatest service to him without permitting curious eyes to come sonear as to detect his artifices</s> now open your ears crowsfeather and you cloud and all of youyoung braves commenced the beehunter solemnly and with asteadiness that was admirable yes open wide your ears</s>  the greatspirit has given the red man a nose that he might smelldoes thecloud smell more than common</s> sartainsmell whiskeythis whiskey centre dey saynatral datsuch smell be here</s> do all the chiefs and warriors of the pottawattamies who arepresent also smell the same</s> spose sowhy he dont eh</s>  got nosecan smell whiskey good waytell you</s> it is right they should smell the liquor here for out of this rocka whiskey spring will soon begin to run</s>  it will begin with a verysmall stream but soon will there be enough to satisfy everybody</s> the great manitou knows that his red children are dry he has sent amedicineman of the palefaces to find a spring for them</s>  nowlook at this piece of rockit is drynot even the dew has yetmoistened it</s>  seeit is made like a wooden bowl that it may holdthe liquor of the spring</s>  let crowsfeather smell itsmell itcloudlet all my young men smell it too that they may be certainthat there is nothing there</s> on this invitation accompanied as it was by divers flourishes ofthe wand and uttered in a deep solemn tone of voice the wholeparty of the indians gathered around the small hollow basinlikecavity pointed out by the beehunter in order both to see and tosmell</s>  most knelt and each and all applied their noses to the rockas near the bowl as they could thrust them</s>  even the dignified anddistrustful crowsfeather could not refrain from bending in thecrowd</s>  this was the moment for which le bourdon wished and heinstantly prepared to carry out his design</s> previously however to completing the project originally conceiveda momentary impulse prevailed which urged him to adopt a new mode ofeffecting his escape</s>  now that most of the savages were on theirhands and knees struggling to get their noses as near as possibleto the bowl and all were intent on the same object it occurred tothe beehunter who was almost as active as the panther of theamerican forest that he might dash on toward the canoe and makehis escape without further mummery</s>  had it been only a question ofhuman speed perhaps such would have been the wisest thing he coulddo but a moments reflection told him how much swifter than anyfoot of man was the bullet of a rifle</s>  the distance exceeded ahundred yards and it was altogether in bright light by means ofthe two fires wolfseye continuing to pile brush on that near whichhe still maintained his post as if afraid the precious liquor wouldstart out of the scentspot and be wasted should he abandon hisward</s>  happily therefore le bourdon relinquished his dangerousproject almost as soon as it was entertained turning his attentionimmediately to the completion of the plan originally laid</s> it has been said that the beehunter made sundry flourishes with hiswand</s>  while the savages were most eager in endeavoring to smell therock he lightly touched the earth that confined the whiskey in thelargest pool and opened a passage by which the liquor could trickledown the side of the rock selecting a path for itself until itactually came into the bowl by a sinuous but certain channel</s> here was a wonder</s>  liquor could not only be smelled but it could beactually seen</s>  as for cloud not satisfied with gratifying the twosenses connected with the discoveries named he began to lap withhis tongue like a dog to try the effect of taste</s> the manitou does not hide his face from the pottawattamie</s> exclaimed this savage rising to his feet in astonishment this isthe firewater and such as the palefaces bring us for skins</s> others imitated his example and the exclamations of wonder anddelight flew from mouth to mouth in a torrent of vehementassertions and ejaculations</s>  so great a medicine charm had neverbefore been witnessed in that tribe or in that region and ahundred more might succeed before another should equal this in itswelcome character</s>  there was whiskey of a certainty not much inquantity to be sure but of excellent quality as several affirmedand coming in a current that was slowly increasing</s>  this last signwas owing to the circumstance that le bourdon had deepened theoutlet of the pool permitting a larger quantity to flow down thelittle channel</s> the moment had now come for a decisive step</s>  the beehunter knewthat his precious rivulet would soon cease to run and that he mustcarry out his design under the first impressions of his charm orthat he probably would not be permitted to carry it out at all</s>  atthis moment even crowsfeather appeared to be awed by what he hadseen but a chief so sagacious might detect the truth anddisappointment would then be certain to increase the penalties hewould incur</s> making many sweeps of his wand and touching various points of therock both to occupy the attention of the savages and to divert itfrom his pool the beehunter next felt in his pocket and drew out asmall piece of resin that he knew was there the remains of a storewith which he resined the bow of his fiddle for our hero had aviolin among his effects and often used it in his solitary abodesin the openings</s>  breaking this resin on a coal he made it flash andblaze but the quantity was too small to produce the medicinefirehe wanted</s> i have more in my canoe he said addressing himself to theinterpreter while i go for it the red men must not stir lestthey destroy a palefaces doings</s>  least of all they must go nearthe spring</s>  it would be better for the chiefs to lead away theiryoung men and make them stand under the oak where nothing can bedone to hurt the medicinecharm</s> the beehunter pointed to a tree that stood in the direction of thecanoe in order to prevent distrust though he had taken care toselect a spot whence the little craft could not be seen on accountof an intervening swell in the land crowsfeather led his warriorsto the indicated place where they took their stations in silentand grave attention</s> in the mean while le bourdon continued his incantations aloudwalking toward his canoe waving his hand and uttering a great dealof gibberish as he slowly proceeded</s>  in passing the tree our herothough he did not turn his head was sensible that he was followedby the chiefs a movement against which he did not dare toremonstrate though it sadly disappointed him</s>  neither hastening norretarding his steps however in consequence of this unpleasantcircumstance the young man continued on once or twice sweeping thewand behind him in order to ascertain if he could reach hisfollowers</s>  but crowsfeather and his companions stopped when theyreached the swell of land which concealed the canoe suffering themedicineman to move on alone</s>  of this fact le bourdon becameaware by turning three times in a circle and pointing upward atthe heavens with his wand as he did so</s> it was a nervous moment when the beehunter reached the canoe</s>  hedid not like to look behind him again lest the chiefs shouldsuspect his motive and in shoving off from the shore he might doso within a few yards of the muzzle of a hostile rifle</s>  there was notime to lose however for any protracted delay on his part wouldcertainly cause the savages to approach through curiosity if notthrough distrust of his motives</s>  he stepped into his light crafttherefore without any delay still flourishing his wand andmuttering his incantations</s>  the first thing was to walk to the sternof the canoe that his weight might raise the bow from the shoreand also that he might have an excuse for turning round and thusget another look at the indians</s>  so critical was his situation andso nervous did it make our young hero that he took no heed of thestate of matters in the canoe until the last moment</s>  when he hadturned however he ascertained that the two principal chiefs haddrawn so near as to be within twenty yards of him though neitherheld his rifle at ready but each leaned on it in a carelessmanner as if in no anticipation of any necessity to make a speedyuse of the weapon</s>  this state of things could not last and lebourdon braced his nerves for the final trial</s>  on looking for hispaddle however he found that of three which the canoe hadcontained when he left it not even one was to be seen</s>  these wilysavages had out of all question taken their opportunity to removeand secrete these simple but almost indispensable means of motion</s> at the instant when first apprised of the loss just mentioned thebeehunters heart sunk within him and he fell into the seat in thestern of the canoe nearly with the weight of so much lead</s>  then aspecies of desperation came over him and putting an end of his canewand upon the bottom with a vigorous shove he forced the canoeswiftly astern and to windward</s>  sudden as was this attempt andrapid as was the movement the jealous eyes and ready hands of thechiefs seemed to anticipate it</s>  two shots were fired within a fewseconds after the canoe had quitted the shore</s>  the reports of therifles were a declaration of hostilities and a general yellaccompanied by a common rush toward the river announced that thewhole band now understood that some deception had been practised attheir expense</s> although the two chiefs in advance had been so very prompt theywere not quick enough for the rapid movement of the canoe</s>  thedistance between the stern of the boat and the riceplants was sosmall that the single desperate shove given by the beehuntersufficed to bury his person in the cover before the leadenmessengers reached him</s>  anticipating this very attempt and knowingthat the savages might get their range from the part of the canoethat was still in sight le bourdon bent his body far over thegunwale grasping the riceplants at the same time and hauling hislittle craft through them in the way that sailors call hand overhand</s>  this expedient most probably saved his life</s>  while bendingover the gunwale he heard the crack of the rifles and the whizzingof two bullets that appeared to pass just behind him</s>  by this timethe whole of the canoe was within the cover</s> in a moment like that we are describing incidents pass so rapidlyas almost to defy description</s>  it was not twenty seconds from theinstant when le bourdon first put his wand down to push the canoefrom the land ere he found his person emerging from the cover onits weather side</s>  here he was effectually concealed from hisenemies not only on account of the cover made by the riceplantsbut by reason of the darkness the light not extending far enoughfrom the fire to illumine objects on the river</s>  nevertheless newdifficulties presented themselves</s>  when clear of the rice the windwhich still blew strong pressed upon his canoe to such a degree asnot only to stop its further movement from the shore but so as toturn it broadside to to its power</s>  trying with his wand the beehunter ascertained that it would no longer reach the bottom</s>  then heattempted to use the cane as a paddle but soon found it had notsufficient hold of the water to answer for such an implement</s>  themost he could effect with it in that way was to keep the canoe fora short distance along the outer edge of the rice until it reacheda spot where the plant extended a considerable distance farthertoward the middle of the river</s>  once within this little forest ofthe wild rice he was enabled to drag the canoe farther and fartherfrom the north shore though his progress was both slow andlaborious on account of the resistance met</s> all this time the savages were not idle</s>  until the canoe got withinits new cover it was at no instant fifty yards from the beach andthe yells and orders and whoopings sounded as if uttered directlyin le bourdons ear</s>  a splashing in the water soon announced thatour fugitive was pursued by swimmers</s>  as the savages knew that thebeehunter was without a paddle and that the wind blew fresh theexpectation of overtaking their late captive in this manner was byno means chimerical</s>  half a dozen active young men would prove veryformidable to one in such a situation more especially whileentangled in the mazes of the riceplant</s>  the beehunter was so wellconvinced of this circumstance that no sooner did he hear thesplashes of the swimmers than he redoubled his exertions to pullhis canoe farther from the spot</s>  but his progress was slow and hewas soon convinced that his impunity was more owing to the fact thathis pursuers did not know where to find him than to the rapidity ofhis flight</s> notwithstanding his exertions and the start obtained le bourdonsoon felt assured that the swimmers were within a hundred feet ofhim their voices coming from the outer margin of the cover in whichhe now lay stationary</s>  he had ceased dragging the canoe ahead froman apprehension of being heard though the rushing of the wind andthe rustling of the rice might have assured him that the slightnoises made by his own movements would not be very likely to riseabove those sounds</s>  the splashing of the swimmers and their voicesgradually drew nearer until the beehunter took up his rifledetermined to sacrifice the first savage who approached hopingthereby to intimidate the others</s>  for the first time it nowoccurred to him that the breech of his rifle might be used as apaddle and he was resolved to apply it to that service could heonce succeed in extricating himself from the enemies by whom he wasnearly environed and from the rice</s> just as le bourdon fancied that the crisis had arrived and that heshould soon be called on to kill his man a shout was given by asavage at some distance in the river and presently calls passedfrom mouth to mouth among the swimmers</s>  our hero now listened to adegree that kept his faculty of hearing at a point of painfulattention</s>  the voices and plashes on the water receded and what wasstartling a sound was heard resembling that which as produced by apaddle when struck incautiously against the side of a canoe</s>  was itthen possible that the chippewa was out or had the pottawattamiesone boat that had escaped his attention</s>  the last was not veryprobable as he had several times counted their little fleet andwas pretty sure of having taken it all to the other side of theriver</s>  the sound of the paddle was repeated however then itoccurred to the beehunter that pigeonswing might be on the scentfor another scalp</s> although the conjecture just mentioned was exceedingly unpleasant tole bourdon the chase of the strange canoe gave him an opportunityto drag his own light craft ahead penetrating deeper and deeperamong the wild rice which now spread itself to a considerabledistance from the shore and grew so thick as to make it impossibleto get through the waving mass</s>  at length wearied with hisexertions and a little uncertain as to his actual position ourhero paused listening intently in order to catch any sounds thatmight direct his future movements</s> by this time the savages ceased to call to each other most probablyconscious of the advantage it gave the fugitive</s>  the beehunterperfectly understood that his pursuers must be aware of its beingentirely out of his power to get to windward and that they wouldkeep along the shore of the river as he did himself expecting tosee his canoe sooner or later driven by the wind on the beach</s>  thishad made him anxious to drag his boat as much toward the outer edgeof the rice as he could get it and by the puffs of wind that heoccasionally felt he hoped he had in a great measure effected hispurpose</s>  still he had his apprehensions of the savages as somewould be very apt to swim quite out into the stream not only tolook for him but to avoid being entangled among the plants</s>  it wasonly in the natural channels of the rice of which there were a goodmany that a swimmer could very readily make his way or be in muchsafety</s>  by waiting long enough moreover the beehunter was sure heshould tire out his pursuers and thus get rid of them</s> just as le bourdon began to think this lastmentioned purpose hadbeen accomplished he heard low voices directly to windward and thesplashing of water as if more than one man was coming down uponhim forcing the stalks of the plants aside</s>  he grasped the rifleand let the canoe drift which it did slowly under the power of thewind notwithstanding the protection of the cover</s>  the swimmersforced their way through the stalks but it was evident just thenthat they were more occupied by their present pursuit than inlooking for him</s>  presently a canoe came brushing through the riceforced by the wind and dragged by two savages one of whom swam oneach bow</s>  the last did not see the beehunter or his canoe the onenearest having his face turned in the opposite direction but theywere distinctly seen by the former</s>  surprised that a seizure shouldbe made with so little fracas le bourdon bent forward to look thebetter and as the stern of the strange canoe came almost under hiseyes he saw the form of margery lying in its bottom</s>  his bloodcurdled at this sight for his first impression was that thecharming young creature had been killed and scalped but there beingno time to lose he sprang lightly from one canoe to the othercarrying the rifle in his hand</s>  as he struck in the bottom of theboat of gershom he heard his name uttered in a sweet female voiceand knew that margery was living</s>  without stopping however toinquire more he moved to the head of the canoe and with a sharpblow on the fingers made each of the savages release his grasp</s> then seizing the riceplants he dragged the little craft swiftlyto windward again</s>  all this was done as it might be in an instantthe

smokeand he foresaw the probability of his enemies obtaining the means ofcrossing the stream should the strangers proceed in the desireddirection</s>  to counteract this design he ran down to a spot on thebeach where there was no riceplant and showing himself to thestrangers invited them to land on the south side which was muchthe nearest and in other visible respects quite as convenient asthe

to renderhim exceedingly averse to making the present journey in his company</s> the necessity of the case as connected with the preservation of hisown life after the massacre of fort dearborn and the influence ofthe missionary had induced him to overlook his ancient prejudicesand to forget opinions that it now occurred to him had beenfounded in error</s>  once fairly within the influence of peters wilesa simpleminded soldier like the corporal was soon completely madethe indians dupe</s>  by the time the canoe reached the mouth of thekalamazoo as has been related each of these men placed the mostimplicit reliance on the good faith and friendly feelings of thevery being whose entire life both sleeping and waking thoughtswere devoted not only to his destruction but to that of the wholewhite race on the american continent</s>  so bland was the manner ofthis terrible savage when it comported with his views to concealhis ruthless designs that persons more practised and observant thaneither

connected with it may be sometimes wrong</s>  this indian knewnothing of the principles of colonization and had no conceptionthat any other than its original ownersoriginal so far as histraditions reachedcould have a right to his own huntinggrounds</s> of the slow but certain steps by which an overruling providence isextending a knowledge of the true god and of the great atonementthrough the

narrow and shortsighted meansof vengeance and redress</s>  in all this he acted in common withtecumseh and his brother though his consummate art kept him behinda veil while the others were known and recognized as open andactive foes</s>  no publication speaks of this peter nor does anyorator enumerate his qualities while the other two chiefs have beenthe subjects of every species of descriptive talent from that ofthe poet to that of the painter</s> as day passed after day the feeling of distrust in the bosom of thebeehunter grew weaker and weaker and peter succeeded in graduallyworming

care how his companions regarded his deportment</s>  hissecret purposes he kept carefully smothered in his own breast it istrue but beyond that no other sign of duplicity could have beendiscovered

of certain semiconfidential communications received in hischaracter of a red man</s>  it was no part of peters true policy tobecome an ally to either of the great belligerents of the day</s>  onthe contrary his ardent wish was to see them destroy each otherand it was the sudden occurrence of the present war that had given anew impulse to his hopes and a new stimulus to his efforts as atime most propitious to his purposes</s>  he was perfectly aware of thestate of the chippewas feelings and he knew that this man washostile to the pottawattamies as well as to most of the tribes ofmichigan but this made no difference with him</s>  if pigeonswing tookthe scalp of a white man he cared not whether it grew on an englishor an american head in either case it was the destruction of hisenemy</s>  with such a policy constantly in view it cannot be matter ofsurprise that peter continued on just as good terms with pigeonswingas with crowsfeather</s>  but one precaution was observed in hisintercourse with the first</s>  to crowsfeather then on the warpath inquest of yankee scalps he had freely communicated his designs onhis own white companions while he did not dare to confide to thechippewa this particular secret since that indians relations withthe beehunter were so amicable as to be visible to every observer</s> peter felt the necessity of especial caution in his communicationwith this savage therefore and this was the reason why thechippewa was in so much painful uncertainty as to the othersintentions</s>  he had learned enough to be distrustful but not enoughto act with decision</s> once and once only during their slow passage up the kalamazoo didthe beehunter observe something about peter to awaken his originalapprehensions</s>  the fourth day after leaving the mouth of the riverand when the whole party were resting after the toil of passing acarryingplace our hero had observed the eyes of that tribelesssavage roaming from one white face to another with an expression inthem so very fiendish as actually to cause his heart to beatquicker than common</s>  the look was such a one as le bourdon could notremember to have ever before beheld in a human countenance</s>  in pointof fact he had seen peter in one of those moments when the pentfires of the volcano that ceaselessly raged within his bosom werebecoming difficult to suppress and when memory was busiest inrecalling to his imagination scenes of oppression and wrong thatthe white man is only too apt to forget amid the ease of hiscivilization and the security of his power</s>  but the look and theimpression produced by it on le bourdon soon passed away and wereforgotten by him to whom it might otherwise have proved to be a mostuseful warning</s> it was a little remarkable that margery actually grew to be attachedto peter often manifesting toward the chief attentions and feelingssuch as a daughter is apt to exhibit toward a father</s>  this arosefrom the high and courteous bearing of this extraordinary savage</s>  atall times an indian warrior is apt to maintain the dignified andcourteous bearing that has so often been remarked in the race butit is very seldom that he goes out of his way to manifest attentionto the squaws</s>  doubtless these men have the feelings of humanityand love their wives and offspring like others but it is soessential a part of their training to suppress the exhibition ofsuch emotions that it is seldom the mere lookeron has occasion tonote them</s>  peter however had neither wife nor child or if theyexisted no one knew where either was to be found</s>  the same mysteryshrouded this part of his history as veiled all the rest</s>  in hishunts various opportunities occurred for exhibiting to the femalesmanly attentions by offering to them the choicest pieces of hisgame and pointing out the most approved indian modes of cooking themeats so as to preserve their savory properties</s>  this he didsparingly at first and as a part of a system of profound deceptionbut day by day and hour after hour most especially with margerydid his manner become sensibly less distant and more natural</s>  theartlessness the gentle qualities blended with feminine spirit asthey were and the innocent gayety of the girl appeared to win onthis nearly remorseless savage in spite of his efforts to resisther influence</s>  perhaps the beauty of margery contributed its sharein exciting these novel emotions in the breast of one so stern</s>  wedo not mean that peter yielded to feelings akinto love of this hewas in a manner incapable but a man can submit to a gentle regardfor woman that shall be totally free from passion</s>  this sort ofregard peter certainly began to entertain for margery and likebegetting like as money produces money it is not surprising thatthe confidence of the girl herself as well as her sympathiesshould continue to increase in the favor of this terrible indian</s> but the changes of feeling and the various little incidents towhich we have alluded did not occur in a single moment of time</s>  daypassed after day and still the canoes were working their way up thewinding channels of the kalamazoo placing at each setting sunlonger and longer reaches of its sinuous stream between thetravellers and the broad sheet of michigan</s>  as le bourdon had beenup and down the river often in his various excursions he acted asthe pilot of the navigation though all worked even to themissionary and the chippewa</s>  on such an expedition toil was notdeemed to be discreditable to a warrior and pigeonswing used thepaddle and the pole as willingly and with as much dexterity as anyof the party</s> it was only on the eleventh day after quitting the mouth of theriver that the canoes came to in the little bay where le bourdonwas in the habit of securing his light bark when in the openings</s> castle meal was in full view standing peacefully in its sweetsolitude and hive who as he came within the range of his oldhunts had started off and got to the spot the previous eveningnow stood on the bank of the river to welcome his master and hisfriends to the chiente</s>  it wanted a few minutes of sunset as thetravellers landed and the parting rays of the great luminary of oursystem were glancing through the various glades of the openingsimparting a mellow softness to the herbage and flowers</s>  so far asthe beehunter could perceive not even a bear had visited the placein his absence</s>  on ascending to his abode and examining thefastenings and on entering the hut storehouse

to house the adventurers andthe little habitation already built was quite insufficient for sucha purpose</s>  it was given to the females who used it as a privateapartment for themselves while the cooking eating and evensleeping so far as the males were concerned were all done beneaththe trees of the openings</s>  but a new chiente was soon constructedwhich though wanting in the completeness and strength of castlemeal was sufficient for the wants of these sojourners in thewilderness</s>  it is surprising with how little of those comforts whichcivilization induces us to regard as necessaries we can get alongwhen cast into the midst of the western wilds</s>  the female whose foothas trodden from infancy upward on nothing harder than a goodcarpetwho has been reared amid all the appliances of abundance andart seems at once to change her nature along with her habits andoften proves a heroine and an active assistant when there was somuch reason to apprehend she might turn out to be merely anencumbrance</s>  in the course of a life that is now getting to be wellstored with experience of this sort as well as of many othervarieties we can recall a hundred cases of women who were born andnurtured in affluence and abundance who have cheerfully quitted thescenes of youth their silks and satins their china and platetheir mahogany and brussels to follow husbands and fathers into thewilderness there to compete with the savage often for food andalways for the final possession of the soil</s> but in the case of dorothy and blossom the change had never been ofthis very broad

works that is to say within doors and to render homeneat comfortable and welcome</s>  as housewives they were expert andwilling considering the meagreness of their means and le bourdontold the halfdelighted halfblushing margery ere the latter hadbeen twentyfour hours in his chiente that nothing but the presenceof such a one as herself was wanting to render it an abode fit for aprince</s>  then the cooking was so much improved</s>  apart fromcleanliness the venison was found to be more savory the cakes werelighter and the pork less greasy</s>  on this subject of greasehowever we could wish that a sense of right would enable us toannounce its utter extinction in the american kitchen or if notabsolutely its extinction such a subjection of the unctuousproperties as to bring them within the limits of a reasonablyaccurate and healthful taste</s>  to be frank dorothy carried asomewhat heavy hand in this respect but pretty margery was muchher superior</s>  how this difference in domestic discipline occurredis more than we can say but of its existence there can be no doubtthere are two very respectable sections of the civilized world towhich we should imagine no rational being would ever think ofresorting in order to acquire the art of cookery and these aregermany and the land of the pilgrims</s>  one hears and reads in thoseelegant specimens of the polite literature of the day the lettersfrom washington and from various travellers who go up and downthis river in steamboats or along that railway gratis much inhonor of the good things left behind the several writers in theregion of the kock but woe betide the wight who is silly enoughto believe in all this poetical imagery and who travels in thatdirection in the expectation of finding a good table</s>  it isextraordinary that such a marked difference does exist on aninterest of this magnitude among such near neighbors but of thefact we should think no intelligent and experienced man can doubt</s> believing as we do that no small portion of the elements ofnational character can be and are formed in the kitchen thecircumstance may appear to us of more moment than to some of ourreaders</s>  the vacuum left in cookery between boston and baltimorefor instance is something like that which exists between leverriers new planet and the sun</s> but margery could even fry pork without causing it to swim ingrease and at a venison steak a professed cook was not hersuperior</s>  she also understood various little mysteries in the wayof converting their berries and fruits of the wilderness intopleasant dishes and corporal flint soon affirmed that it was athousand pities she did not live in a garrison which agreeably tohis view of things was something like placing her at the comptoirof

different varieties daily keeping the larder quite as wellsupplied as comported with the warmth of the weather while theothers worked on the new chiente</s>  in order to obtain materials forthis building one so much larger than his old abode ben went upthe kalamazoo about half a mile where he felled a sufficient numberof young pines with trunks of about a foot in diameter cuttingthem into lengths of twenty and thirty feet respectively</s>  theselengths or trunks were rolled into the river down which theyslowly floated until they arrived abreast of castle meal wherethey were met by peter in a canoe who towed each stick as itarrived to the place of landing</s>  in this way at the end of twodays work a sufficient quantity of materials was collected tocommence directly on the building itself</s> loghouses are of so common occurrence as to require no particulardescription of the one now put up from us</s>  it was rather less thanthirty feet in length and onethird narrower

and highly interesting account</s>  one ofthese days we shall hear it all in the mean time it may be wellenough to turn one of these houses into some sort of a garrison</s> let it then be castle meal

with this compromise the work went on</s>  the corporal dug a trenchfour feet deep encircling the castle as happy as a lord thewhole time for this was not the first time he had been at suchwork which

usually from the rising tothe setting sun out hunting for the support of the party whilepeter passed most of his time in ruminations and solitary walks</s> this last paid little attention to the work about the castle eitherknowing it would at any moment by an act of treachery be in hispower to render all these precautions of no avail or relying onthe amount of savage force that he knew was about to collect in theopenings</s>  whenever he cast a glance on the progress of the work itwas with an eye of great indifference once he even carried hisduplicity so far as to make a suggestion to the corporal by meansof which as he himself expressed it in his imperfect englishinjin no get inside to use knife and tomahawk</s>  this seemingindifference on the part of peter did not escape the observationof the beehunter who became still less distrustful of thatmysterious savage as he noted his conduct in connection with thedispositions making for defence</s> le bourdon would not allow a tree of any sort to be felled anywherenear his abode</s>  while the corporal and his associates were busy indigging the trench he had gone to a considerable distance quiteout of sight from castle meal and near his great highway theriver where he cut and trimmed the necessary number of burroaksfor the palisades</s>  boden labored the more cheerfully at this workfor two especial reasons</s>  one was the fact that the defences mightbe useful to himself hereafter as much against bears as againstindians and the other because margery daily brought her sewing orknitting and sat on the fallen trees laughing and chatting as theaxe performed its duties</s>  on three several occasions peter waspresent also accompanying blossom with a kindness of manner andan attention to her pretty little tastes in culling flowers thatwould have done credit to a man of a higher school of civilization</s> the reader is not to suppose however because the indian pays butlittle outward attention to the squaws that he is without naturalfeeling or manliness of character</s>  in some respects his chivalrousdevotion to the sex is perhaps in no degree inferior to that ofthe class which makes a parade of such sentiments and this quite asmuch from convention and ostentation as from any other motive</s>  thered man is still a savage beyond all question but he is a savagewith so many nobler and more manly qualities when uncorrupted bycommunion with the worst class of whites and not degraded byextreme poverty as justly to render him a subject of ouradmiration in selfrespect in dignity and in simplicity ofdeportment</s>  the indian chief is usually a gentleman and thisthough he may have never heard of revelation and has not thesmallest notion of the atonement and of the deep obligations it haslaid on the human race</s> amid the numberless exaggerations of the day one of particularcapacity has arisen connected with the supposed character of agentleman</s>  those who regard all things through the medium ofreligious feeling are apt to insist that he who is a christian isnecessarily a gentleman while he can be no thorough gentleman whohas not most of the qualities of the christian character</s>  thisconfusion in thought and language can lead to no really usefulresult while it embarrasses the minds of many and renders theexpression of our ideas less exact and comprehensive than they wouldotherwise be</s> we conceive that a man may be very much of a christian and verylittle of a gentleman or very much of a gentleman and very littleof a christian</s>  there is in short not much in common between thetwo characters though it is possible for them to become united inthe same individual</s>  that the finished courtesies of polished lifemay wear some of the aspects of that benevolence which causes thechristian to love his neighbor as himself is certainly truethough the motives of the parties are so very different as todestroy all real identity between them</s>  while the moving principleof a gentleman is selfrespect that of a christian is humility</s>  thefirst is ready to lay down his life in order to wipe away animaginary dishonor or to take the life of another

conformto his will in obedience to his revealed mandates</s>  certainly thereis that which is both grateful and useful in the refined deportmentof one whose mind and manners have been polished even in the schoolsof the world but it is degrading to the profoundly beautifulsubmission of the truly christian temper to imagine that anythinglike a moral parallel can justly be run between them</s> of course peter had none of the qualities of him who sees and feelshis own defects and relies only on the merits of the atonement forhis place among the children of light while he had so many of thosequalities which depend on the estimate which man is so apt to placeon his own merits</s>  in this last sense this indian had a great manyof the essentials of a gentleman a lofty courtesy presiding overall his intercourse with others when passion or policy did notthrust in new and sudden principles of action</s>  even the missionarywas so much struck with the gentleness of this mysterious savagesdeportment in connection with margery as at first to impute it to agrowing desire to make a wife of that flower of the wilderness</s>  butcloser observation induced greater justice to the indian in thisrespect nothing like the uneasiness impatience or distrust ofpassion could be discerned in his demeanor and when parson amenperceived that the beehunters marked devotion to the beautifulblossom rather excited a benevolent and kind interest in thefeelings of peter so far at least as one could judge of the heartby external appearances than anything that bore the fierce anduneasy impulses of jealousy he was satisfied that his originalimpression was a mistake</s> as le bourdon flourished his axe and margery plied her needlesmaking a wholesome provision for the coming winter the mysteriousindian would stand a quarter of an hour at a time immovable as astatue his eyes riveted first on one and then on the other</s>  whatpassed at such moments in that stern breast it exceeds thepenetration of man to say but that the emotions thus pent withinbarriers that none could pass or destroy were not always ferociousand revengeful a carefully observant spectator might

the ocean and men in the forest are only tooapt to overlook the returns of the sabbath thus slowly butinevitably alienating themselves more and more from the dread beingwho established the festival as much in his own honor as for thegood of man</s>  when we are told that the almighty is jealous of hisrights and desires to be worshipped we are not to estimate thiswish by any known human standard but are ever to bear in mind thatit is exactly in proportion as we do reverence the creator and rulerof heaven and earth that we are nearest or farthest from thecondition of the blessed</s>  it is probably for his own good that theadoration of man is pleasing in the eyes of god</s> the missionary though a visionary and an enthusiast as respectedthe children of israel was a zealous observer of his duties</s>  onsundays he never neglected to set up his tabernacle even though itwere in a howling wilderness and went regularly through the worshipof god according to the form of the sect to which he belonged</s>  hisinfluence on the present occasion was sufficient to cause asuspension of all labor though not without some remonstrances onthe part of the corporal</s>  the latter contended that in militaryaffairs there was no sunday known unless it might be in peaceabletimes and that he had never heard of intrenchments resting fromtheir labors on the part of either the besieger or the besieged</s> work of that sort he thought ought to go on day and night bymeans of reliefs and instead of pausing to hold church he hadactually contemplated detailing fatigue parties to labor throughnot only that day but the whole of the succeeding night</s> as for peter he never offered the slightest objection to any ofparson amens sermons or prayers</s>  he listened to both with unmovedgravity though no apparent impression was ever made on hisfeelings</s>  the chippewa hunted on the sabbaths as much as on anyother day and it was in reference to this fact that the followinglittle conversation took place between margery and the missionaryas the party sat beneath the oaks passing a tranquil eventide atmidsummer</s> how happens it mr</s>  amen said margery who had insensibly adoptedthe missionarys sobriquet that no red man keeps the sabbathdayif they are all descended from the jews</s>  this is one of the mostrespected of all the commandments and it does not

absent more than thecustomary time</s> as there were just one hundred feet of ditch to fill with dirt thetask was completed and that quite thoroughly long ere the close ofthe day</s>  the pounding down of the earth consumed more time and wasmuch more laborious than the mere tumbling of the earth back intoits former bed but even this portion of the work was sufficientlyattended to</s>  when all was done the corporal himself a verycritical sort of person in what he called garrisons was fain toallow that it was as pretty a piece of palisading as he had everlaid eyes on</s>  the garrison wanted only one thing now to renderit a formidable postand that was waterno spring or well existingwithin its narrow limit however he procured two or three emptybarrels portions of le bourdons effects placed

a single wellarmed man might suffice to defend twentyfive feet of palisadeswhen he would have been insufficient to make good his position withtwice the extent</s>  then le bourdon had cut loops on three sides ofthe hut itself in order to fire at the bears and sometimes at thedeer which had often approached the building in its days ofsolitude and quiet using the window on the fourth side for the samepurpose</s>  in a word a sense of increased security was felt by thewhole party when this work was completed though one arrangement wasstill wanting to render it perfect</s>  by separating the real garrisonfrom the nominal garrison during the night there always existed thedanger of surprise and the corporal now that his fortificationswere finished soon devised a plan to obviate this

were squared on one of theirsides</s>  above at the height of a mans head a roof of bark wasreared on poles and prairie grass aided by skins formed verycomfortable barrackbeds beneath</s>  as the men were expected to liewith their heads to the wall of the hut and their feet outwardthere was ample space for twice their number</s>  thither then wereall the homely provisions for the night transported

aware of the mysterious chiefs principaldesign that of destroying the white race altogether and ofrestoring the red men to their ancient rights but several reasonsprevented his entering into the plot heart and hand</s>  in the firstplace he was friendly to the yankees from whom he personallyhad received many favors and no wrongs then the tribe or halftribe to which he belonged had been employed more or less by theagents of the american government as runners and in othercapacities ever since the peace of 83 and lastly he himself hadbeen left much in different garrisons where he had not onlyacquired his english but a habit of thinking of the americans ashis friends</s>  it might also be added that pigeonswing though farless gifted by nature than the mysterious peter had formed a truerestimate of the power of the yankees and did not believe theywere to be annihilated so easily</s>  how it happened that this indianhad come to a conclusion so much safer than that of peters a manof twice his capacity is more than we can explain though it wasprobably owing to the accidental circumstances of his more intimateassociations with the whites</s> the beehunter was by nature a man of observation a faculty thathis habits had both increased and stimulated</s>  had it not been forthe manner in which he was submitting to the influence of margeryhe would long before have seen that

gayety and inspiring himwith her innocent humor he fancied she was there imaginationperhaps heightening all those advantages which we have enumerated</s> when a man is thoroughly in love he is quite apt to be fit for verylittle else but to urge his suit</s>  such in a certain way proved tobe the case with le bourdon who allowed things to pass unheededdirectly before his eyes that previously to his acquaintance withmargery would not only have been observed but which would have mostprobably led to some practical results</s>  the conduct of pigeonswingwas among the circumstances that were thus overlooked by our hero</s> in point of fact peter was slowly but surely working on the mind ofthe chippewa changing all his opinions radically and teaching himto regard every paleface as an enemy</s>  the task in this instancewas not easy for pigeonswing in addition to his generalpropensities in favor of the yankees the result of mere accidenthad conceived a real personal regard for le bourdon and was veryslow to admit any views that tended to his injury</s>  the struggle inthe mind of the young warrior was severe and twenty times was he onthe point of warning his friend of the danger which impended overthe whole party when a sense of good faith toward peter who heldhis word to the contrary prevented his so doing</s>  this conflict offeeling was now constantly active in the breast of the young savage</s> pigeonswing had another source of uneasiness to which hiscompanions were entirely strangers</s>  while hunting his keen eyes haddetected the presence of warriors in the openings</s>

whole history of the paleface religion</s> as weve had a smart walk however and here is the bears meat safeand sound just as you left it let us sit down a bit on this trunkof a tree while i give you our tradition from beginning to end asit might be</s>  in the first place chippewa the earth was madewithout creatures of any sort to live on itnot so much as asquirrel or a woodchuck</s> poor country

the palefaceshave got possession of the best parts of the earth as it might beand i think they mean to keep them</s>  first come first served youknow</s>  the palefaces are many and are strong</s>

him</s> why chippewa you might as well count the bees asthey buzz around a fallen tree</s>  you saw me cut down the tree i lastdiscovered and saw the movement of the little animals and mayjudge what

know how manydis side of great salt lake</s> thats another matter and more easily come at</s>  i understand younow chippewa you wish to know how many of us there are in thecountry we call america</s> juss so returned pigeonswing nodding in assent</s>  dat juss itjuss what injin want to know</s> well we do have a count of our own people from time to time andi suppose come about as near to the truth

andpappoose</s> no i see youre warlike this morning and want to see how we arelikely to come out of this struggle with your great canada father</s> counting all round i think we might muster hard on upon a millionof fighting mengood bad and indifferent that is to say theremust be a million of us of proper age to go into the wars</s> pigeonswing made no answer for near a minute</s>  both he and the beehunter had come to a halt alongside of the bears meat and thelatter was beginning to prepare his own portion of the load fortransportation while his companion stood thus motionless lost inthought</s>  suddenly pigeonswing recovered his recollection andresumed the conversation by sayingwhat million mean bourdon</s>  how many time soger at detroit andsoger on lakes</s> a million is more than the leaves on all the trees in theseopeningsle bourdons notions were a little exaggerated perhapsbut this was what he saidyes more than the leaves on all theseoaks far and near</s>  a million is a countless number and i supposewould make a row of men as long as from this spot to the shores ofthe great salt lake if not farther</s> it is probable that the beehunter himself had no very clear notionof the distance of which he spoke or of the number of men it wouldactually require to fill the space he mentioned but his answersufficed deeply to impress the imagination of the indian who nowhelped le bourdon to secure his load to his back in silencereceiving the same service in return</s>  when the meat of the bear wassecurely bestowed each resumed his rifle and the friends commencedtheir march in toward the chiente conversing as they went on thematter which still occupied their minds</s>  when the beehunter againtook up the history of the creation it was to speak of our commonmother</s> you will remember chippewa he said that i told you nothing onthe subject of any woman</s>  what i have told you as yet consarnedonly the first man who was made out of clay into whom god breathedthe breath of life</s> dat goodmake warrior fuss</s>  juss right</s>  when breat in him fit totake scalp eh</s> why as to that it is not easy to see whom he was to scalp seeingthat he was quite alone in the world until it pleased his creatorto give him a woman for a companion</s> tell bout dat returned pigeonswing with interesttell how hegot squaw</s> accordin to the bible god caused this man to fall into a deepsleep when he took one of his ribs and out of that he made a squawfor him</s>  then he put them both to live together in a most beautifulgarden in which all things excellent and pleasant was to be foundsome such place as these openings i reckon</s> any bee dere</s>  asked the indian quite innocently</s>  plenty honeyeh</s> that will i answer for</s>  it could hardly be otherwise when it wasthe intention to make the first man and first woman perfectly happy</s> i dare say chippewa if the truth was known it would be found thatbees was a sipping at every flower in that most delightful garden</s> why paleface quit dat garden eh</s>  why come here to drive poorinjin way from game</s>  tell me dat bourdon if he can</s>  why palefaceever leave dat garden

children have scattered overthe face of the earth</s> so come here to drive off injin</s>  well dat e way wid paleface idid ever hear of red man comin to drive off paleface</s> i have heard of your red warriors often coming to take our scalpschippewa</s>  more or less of this has been done every year since ourpeople have landed in america</s>  more than that they have not donefor we are too many to be driven very far in by a few scatteringtribes of injins</s> tink den more paleface dan injin eh</s>  asked the chippewa withan interest so manifest that he actually stopped in his semitrotin order to put the question</s>  more paleface warrior dan red men</s> more</s>  aye a thousand times more chippewa</s>  where you could showone warrior we could show a thousand</s> now this was not strictly true perhaps but it answered thepurpose of deeply impressing the chippewa with the uselessness ofpeters plans and sustained as it was by his early predilectionsit served to keep him on the right side in the crisis which wasapproaching</s>  the discourse continued much in the same strain untilthe men got in with their bears meat having been preceded sometime by the others with the venison</s> it is a little singular that neither the questions nor the mannerof pigeonswing awakened any distrust in the beehunter</s>  so far fromthis the latter regarded all that had passed as perfectly naturaland as likely to arise in conversation in the way of purespeculation as in any other manner</s>  pigeonswing intended to beguarded in what he said and did for as yet he had not made up hismind which side he would really espouse in the event of the greatproject coming to a head</s>  he had the desire natural to a red manto avenge the wrongs committed against his race but this desireexisted in a form a good deal mitigated by his intercourse with theyankees and his regard for individuals</s>  it had neverthelessstrangely occurred to the savage reasoning of this young warriorthat possibly some arrangement might be effected by means of whichhe should take scalps from the canadians while peter and his otherfollowers were working their will on the americans</s>  in this confusedcondition was the mind of the chippewa when he and his companionthrew down their loads near the place where the provision of gamewas usually kept</s>  this was beneath the tree near the spring and thecookhouse in order that no inconvenience should arise from itsproximity to the place where the party dwelt and slept</s>  for a siegeshould there be occasion to shut themselves up within thegarrison the men depended on the pickled pork and a quantity ofdried meat of the latter of which the missionary had brought aconsiderable supply in his own canoe</s>  among these stores were a fewdozen of buffaloes or bisons tongues a delicacy that would honorthe best table in the civilized world though then so common amongthe western hunters as scarce to be deemed food as good as thecommon salted pork and beef of the settlements</s> the evening that followed proved to be one of singular softness andsweetness</s>  the sun went down in a cloudless sky and gentle airsfrom the southwest fanned the warm cheeks of margery as she satresting from the labors of the day with le bourdon at her sidespeaking of the pleasures of a residence in such a spot</s>  the youthwas eloquent for he felt all that he said and the maiden waspleased</s>  the young man could expatiate on bees in a way to arrestany ones attention and margery delighted to hear him relate hisadventures with these little creatures his successes losses andjourneys</s> but are you not often lonely bourdon living here in the openingswhole summers at a time without a living soul to speak to</s> demanded margery coloring to the eyes the instant the question wasasked lest it should subject her to an imputation against which hermodesty revolted that of wishing to draw the discourse to adiscussion on the means of preventing this solitude in future</s> i have not been hitherto answered le bourdon so frankly as atonce to quiet his companions sensitiveness though i will notanswer for the future</s>  now that i have so many with me we may makesome of them necessary</s>  mindi say some not all of my presentguests</s>  if i could have my pick pretty margery the present companywould give me all i can desire and more too</s>  i should not think ofgoing to detroit for that companion since she is to be found somuch nearer</s> margery blushed and looked downthen she raised her eyes smiledand seemed grateful as well as pleased</s>  by this time she had becomeaccustomed to such remarks and she had no difficulty in discoveringher lovers wishes though he had never been more explicit</s>  thereflections natural to her situation threw a shade of gentleseriousness over her countenance rendering her more charming thanever and causing the youth to plunge deeper and deeper into themeshes that female influence had cast around him in all thishowever one of the parties was governed by a manly sincerity andthe other by girlish artlessness</s>  diffidence one of the mostcertain attendants of a pure passion alone kept le bourdon fromasking margery to become his wife while margery herself sometimesdoubted whether it were possible that any reputable man could wishto connect himself and his fortunes with a family that had sunk aslow as persons could well sink in this country and not lose theircharacters altogether</s>  with these doubts and distrusts so naturallyaffecting the mind of each these young people were rapidly becomingmore and more enamored the beehunter betraying his passion in theclose absorbed attentions that more properly belong to his sexwhile that of margery was to be seen in sudden blushes thethoughtful brow the timid glance and a cast of tenderness thatcame over her whole manner and as it might be her whole being</s> while our young folk were thus employed now conversing cheerfullynow appearing abstracted and lost in thought though seated side byside le bourdon happened to look behind him and saw that peter wasregarding them with one of those intense but mysterious expressionsof the countenance that had now more than once attracted hisattention giving reason each time for a feeling in which doubtcuriosity and apprehension were singularly mingled even inhimself</s> at the customary hour which was always early in that party ofsimple habits the whole family sought its rest the femaleswithdrew within the chiente while the males arranged their skinswithout</s>  ever since the erection of the palisades le bourdon hadbeen in the habit of calling hive within the defences leaving himat liberty to roam about inside at pleasure</s>  previously to this newarrangement the dog had been shut up in his kennel in order toprevent his getting on the track of a deer or in close combat withsome bear when his master was not present to profit by his efforts</s> as the palisades were too high for his leap this putting him atliberty within them answered the double purpose of giving themastiff room for healthful exercise and of possessing a mostvigilant sentinel against dangers of all sorts</s>  on the presentoccasion however the dog was missing and after calling andwhistling for him some time the beehunter was fain to bar thegate and leave him on the outside</s>  this done he sought his skinand was soon asleep</s> it was midnight when the beehunter felt a hand laid on his ownarm</s>  it was the corporal making this movement in order to awakehim</s>  in an instant the young man was on his feet with his rifle inhis hand</s> did you not hear it bourdon</s>  demanded the corporal in a tone solow as scarce to exceed a whisper</s> hear what</s>  ive been sleeping sound as a bee in winter</s> the horn</s> the horn has been blown twice and i think we shallsoon hear it again</s> the horn was hanging at the door of the chiente and the conchtoo</s>  it will be easy to see if they are in their places</s> it was only necessary to walk around the walls of the hut to itsopposite side in order to ascertain this fact</s>  le bourdon did soaccompanied by the corporal and just as each laid a hand on theinstruments which were suspended in their proper places a heavyrush was made against the gate as if to try its fastenings</s>  thesepushes were repeated several times with a violence that menaced thebars</s>  of course the two men stepped to the spot a distance of onlya few paces the gateway of the palisades and the door of thechiente being contiguous to each other and immediately ascertainedthat it was the mastiff endeavoring to force his way in</s>  the beehunter admitted the dog which had been trained to suppress hisbark though this animal was too brave and large to throw away hisbreath when he had better rely on his force</s>  powerful animals ofthis race are seldom noisy it being the province of the cur bothamong dogs and men to be blustering and spitting out their venomat all hours and seasons</s>  hive however in addition to his naturaldisposition had been taught from the time he was a pup not tobetray his presence unnecessarily by a bark and it was seldom thathis deep throat opened beneath the arches of the oaks</s>  when it didit told like the roaring of the lion in the desert</s> hive was no sooner admitted to the garrison than he manifestedjust as strong a desire to get out as a moment before he hadmanifested to get in</s>  this le bourdon well knew indicated thepresence of some thing or creature that did not properly belong tothe vicinity</s>  after consulting with the corporal pigeonswing wascalled and leaving him as a sentinel at the gate the two othersmade a sortie</s>  the corporal was as brave as a lion and loved allsuch movements though he fully anticipated encountering savageswhile his companion expected an interview with bears</s> as this movement was made at the invitation of the dog it wasjudiciously determined to let him act as pioneer on the advance</s> previously to quitting the defences however the two adventurerslooked closely to their arms</s>  each examined the priming saw thathis horn and pouch were accessible and loosened his knife in itssheath</s>  the corporal moreover fixed his baggonet as he calledthe formidable glittering instrument that usually embellished theend of his musketa musket being the weapon he chose to carrywhile the beehunter himself was armed with a long western rifle</s> chapter xvi</s>   the raptures of a conquerors mood  rushed burning through his frame  the depths of that green solitude  its torrents could not tame  though stillness lay with eves last smile  round those far fountains of the nile

apprehension ofmeeting any other than a fourfooted enemy notwithstanding theblast of the horn the worthy corporal supposed he had heard</s>  themovements of the dog seemed to announce such a result rather thanany other for hive was taken along as a sort of guide</s>  le bourdonhowever did not permit his mastiff to run off wide but having theanimal at perfect command it was kept close to his own person</s> the two men first moved toward the grove of the kitchen much tohives discontent</s>  the dog several times halted and he whined andgrowled and otherwise manifested his great dislike to proceed inthat direction</s>  at length so decided did his resistance become thathis master said to his companionit seems to me best corporal to let the mastiff lead us</s>  i havenever yet seen him so set on not going in one way and on going inanother</s>  hive has a capital nose and we may trust him</s> forward returned the corporal wheeling short in the direction ofthe dog one thing should be

in his idees about the lost tribes</s> in my opinion therell be more tribes found in these openings beforethe summer is over than we shall wish to meet</s>  let us follow thedog and see what will turn up</s>  hive was followed and he took adirection that led to a distant point in the openings where notonly the trees were much thicker than common but where a smalltributary of the kalamazoo ran through a ravine from the higherlands adjacent into the main artery of all the neighboringwatercourses</s>  the beehunter knew the spot well having often drankat the rivulet and cooled his brow in the close shades of theravine when heated by exertions in the more open grounds</s>  in shortthe spot was one of the most eligible for concealment coolness andpure water within several miles of castle meal</s>  the trees formed aspacious grove around it and by means of the banks their summitsand leaves answered the purpose of a perfect screen to those whomight descend into the ravine or it would be better to say to thebottom</s>  le bourdon was no sooner satisfied that his mastiff wasproceeding toward the great spring which formed the rivulet at thehead of the ravine mentioned than he suspected indians might bethere</s>  he had seen signs about the spot which wore an appearance ofits having been used as a place of encampmentor for camping outas it is termed in the language of the westand coupling the soundof the horn with the dogs movements his quick apprehension seizedon the facts as affording reasonable grounds of distrust</s> consequently he resorted to great caution as he and the corporalentered the wood which surrounded the spring and the small oval bitof bottom that lay spread before it like a little lawn</s>  hive waskept close at his masters side though he manifested a markedimpatience to advance</s>  now corporal said the beehunter in a lowtone i think we have lined some savages to their holes</s>  we will goround the basin and descend to the bottom in a close wood

which that sagacious animal now behaved was trulywonderful</s>  hive appeared to be quite as much aware of the necessityof extreme caution as either of the men and did not once attempt toprecede his master his own length</s>  on one or two occasions heactually discovered the best passages and led his companionsthrough them with something like the intelligence of a human being</s> neither growl nor bark escaped him on the contrary even thehacking breathing of an impatient dog was suppressed precisely asif the animal knew how near he was getting to the most watchful earsin the world</s> after using the greatest care the beehunter and the corporal gotjust such a station as they desired</s>  it was within a very few feetof the edge of the cover but perfectly concealed while smallopenings enabled them to see all that was passing in their front</s>  afallen tree a relic of somewhat rare occurrence in the openings ofmichigan even furnished them with a seat while it rendered theirposition less exposed</s>  hive placed himself at his masters sideapparently trusting to other senses than that of sight for hisinformation since he could see nothing of what was going on infront</s> as soon as the two men had taken their stations and began to lookabout them a feeling of awe mingled with their curiosity</s>  trulythe scene was one so very remarkable and imposing that it might havefilled more intellectual and better fortified minds with some suchsensation</s>  the fire was by no means large nor was it particularlybright but sufficient to cast a dim light on the objects withinreach of its rays</s>  it was in the precise centre of a bit of bottomland of about half an acre in extent which was so formed andsurrounded as to have something of the appearance of the arena of alarge amphitheatre</s>  there was one break in the encircling rise ofground it is true and that was at a spot directly opposite thestation of le bourdon and his companion where the rill which flowedfrom the spring found a passage out toward the more open ground</s> branches shaded most of the mound but the arena itself was totallyfree from all vegetation but that which covered the dense andbeautiful sward with which it was carpeted</s>  such is a briefdescription of the natural accessories of this remarkable scene</s> but it was from the human actors and their aspects occupationsmovements dress and appearance generally that the awe which cameover both the beehunter and the corporal had its origin</s>  of thesenear fifty were present offering a startling force by their numbersalone</s>  each man was a warrior and each warrior was in his paint</s> these were facts that the familiarity of the two white men withindian customs rendered only too certain</s>  what was still morestriking was the fact that all present appeared to be chiefs acircumstance which went to show that an imposing body of red men wasmost likely somewhere in the openings and that too at no greatdistance</s>  it was while observing and reflecting on all these thingsa suspicion first crossed the mind of le bourdon that this greatcouncil was about to be held at that midnight hour and so near hisown abode for the purpose of accommodating peter whose appearancein the dark crowd from that instant he began to expect</s> the indians already present were not seated</s>  they stood in groupsconversing or stalked across the arena resembling so many dark andstately spectres</s>  no sound was heard among them a circumstance thatadded largely to the wild and supernatural aspect of the scene</s>  ifany spoke it was in a tone so low and gentle as to carry the soundno farther than to the ears that were listening two never spoke atthe same time and in the same group while the moccasin permitted nofootfall to be audible</s>  nothing could have been more unearthly thanthe picture presented in that little woodcircled arena of velvetlike grass and rural beauty</s>  the erect stalking forms half nakedif not even more the swarthy skins the faces fierce in the savageconceits which were intended to strike terror into the bosoms ofenemies and the glittering eyes that fairly sparkled in theirmidst all contributed to the character of the scene which lebourdon rightly enough imagined was altogether much the mostremarkable of any he had ever been in the way of witnessing</s> our two spectators might have been seated on the fallen tree half anhour all of which time they had been gazing at what was passingbefore their eyes with positively not a human sound to relieve theunearthly nature of the picture</s>  no one spoke coughed laughed orexclaimed in all that period</s>  suddenly every chief stood stilland all the faces turned in the same direction</s>  it was toward thelittle gateway of the rill which being the side of the arena mostremote from the beehunter and the corporal lay nearly in darknessas respected them</s>  with the red men it must have been different forthey all appeared to be in intent expectation of some one from thatquarter</s>  nor did they have to wait long for in half a minute twoforms came out of the obscurity advancing with a dignified anddeliberate tread to the centre of the arena</s>  as these newcomers gotmore within the influence of the flickering light le bourdon sawthat they were peter and parson amen</s>  the first led with a slowimposing manner while the other followed not a little bewilderedwith what he saw</s>  it may be as well to explain here that the indianwas coming alone to this place of meeting when he encountered themissionary wandering among the oaks looking for le bourdon and thecorporal and instead of endeavoring to throw off this unexpectedcompanion he quietly invited him to be of his own party</s> it was evident to le bourdon at a glance that peter was expectedthough it was not quite so clear that such was the fact as regardedhis companion</s>  still respect for the great chief prevented anymanifestations of surprise or discontent and the medicineman ofthe palefaces was received with as grave a courtesy as if he hadbeen an invited guest</s>  just as the two had entered the dark circlethat formed around them a young chief threw some dry sticks on thefire which blazing upward cast a stronger light on a row of asterrifically looking countenances as ever gleamed on human forms</s> this sudden illumination with its accompanying accessories had theeffect to startle all the white spectators though peter looked onthe whole with a calm like that of the leafless tree when the coldis at its height and the currents of the wintry air are deathlikestill nothing appeared to move him whether expected or not thoughuse had probably accustomed his eye to all the aspects in whichsavage ingenuity could offer savage forms</s>  he even smiled as hemade a gesture of recognition which seemed to salute the wholegroup</s>  it was just then when the fire burned brightest and whenthe chiefs pressed most within its influence that le bourdonperceived that his old acquaintances the headmen of thepottawattamies were present among the other chiefs so strangelyand portentously assembled in these grounds which he had so longpossessed almost entirely to himself</s> a few of the oldest of the chiefs now approached peter and a lowconversation took place between them</s>  what was said did not reach lebourdon of course for it was not even heard in the dark circle ofsavages who surrounded the fire</s>  the effect of this secret dialoguehowever was to cause all the chiefs to be seated each taking hisplace on the grass the whole preserving the original circle aroundthe fire</s>  fortunately for the wishes of le bourdon peter and hiscompanions took their stations directly opposite to his own seatthus enabling him to watch every lineament of that remarkablechiefs still more remarkable countenance</s>  unlike each and all ofthe red men around him the face of peter was not painted except bythe tints imparted by nature which in his case was that of coppera little tarnished or rendered dull by the action of theatmosphere</s>  the beehunter could distinctly trace every lineamentnor was the dark roving eye beyond the reach of his own vision</s>  someattention was given to the fire too one of the younger chiefsoccasionally throwing on it a few dried sticks more to keep alivethe flame and to renew the light than from any need of warmth</s>  oneother purpose however this fire did answer that of enabling theyoung chiefs to light the pipes that were now prepared it seldomoccurring that the chiefs thus assembled without smoking aroundtheir councilfire</s> as this smoking was just then more a matter of ceremony than for anyother purpose a whiff or two suffices for each chief the smokerpassing the pipe to his neighbor as soon as he had inhaled a fewpuffs</s>  the indians are models of propriety in their happiest moodsand every one in that dark and menacing circle was permitted to havehis turn with the pipe before any other step was taken</s>  there werebut two pipes lighted and mouths being numerous some time wasnecessary in order to complete this ceremony</s>  still no sign ofimpatience was seen the lowest chief having as much respect paid tohis feelings as related to his attention as the highest</s>  at lengththe pipes completed their circuit even parson amen getting andusing his turn when a dead pause succeeded</s>  the silence resembledthat of a quaker meeting and was broken only by the rising of oneof the principal chiefs evidently about to speak</s>  the language ofthe great ojebway nation was used on this occasion most of thechiefs present belonging to some one of the tribes of that stockthough several spoke other tongues english and french included</s>  ofthe three whites present parson amen alone fully comprehended allthat was said he having qualified himself in this respect topreach to the tribes of that people though le bourdon understoodnearly all and even the corporal comprehended a good deal</s>  the nameof the chief who first spoke at this secret meeting which wasafterward known among the ojebways by the name of the

this general but portentous calm peter arose</s>  thebreathing of the circle grew deeper so much so as to be audiblethe only manner in which the intensity of the common expectationbetrayed itself</s>

allowed an army to come into their landand to carry away as captives no less than ten of their twelvetribes putting their people in strange huntinggrounds</s>  now thishappened many thousands of moons since and no one can say withcertainty what has become of those captives whom christians areaccustomed to call the lost tribes of israel</s> here the missionary paused to arrange his thoughts and a slightmurmur was heard in the circle as the chiefs communed together ininterested comments on what had just been said</s>  the pause howeverwas short and the speaker again proceeded safe from any ungraciousinterruption among auditors so trained in selfrestraint</s> children i shall not now say anything touching the birth ofchrist the redemption of the world and the history of the twotribes

does</s>  while the good book tells us so much italso leaves very much untold</s>  it is best that we should look forourselves that we may find out some of its meanings</s>  it is in thuslooking that many christians see the great truth which makes theindians of america and the jews beyond the great salt lake one andthe same people</s> if this be so let my brother tell us how far it is from ourhuntinggrounds to that distant land across the great salt lake</s> i cannot give you this distance in miles exactly but i suppose itmay be eleven or twelve times the length of michigan</s> will my brother tell us how much of this long path is water andhow much of it is dry land</s>
perhaps onefourth is land as the traveller may choose the restmust be water if the journey be made from the rising toward thesetting sun which is the shortest path but let the journey bemade from the setting toward the rising sun and there is littlewater to cross rivers and lakes of no great width as is seen herebut only a small breadth of salt lake</s> are there then two roads to that faroff land where the red menare thought to have once lived</s> even so</s>  the traveller may come to this spot from that land by wayof the rising sun or by way of the setting sun</s>

could not understand him didnot fail to produce a deep sensation</s>  if their fortunes were reallythe care of the great spirit and justice was to be done to them byhis love and wisdom then would the projects of peter and those whoacted and felt with him be unnecessary and might lead to evilinstead of to good</s>  that sagacious savage did not fail to discoverthis truth and he now believed it

intense was the desire of this mysteriousleader to execute vengeance on the palefaces that the redemptionof the tribes from misery and poverty unaccompanied by this part ofhis own project would have given him pain in lieu of pleasure</s>  hisvery soul had got to be absorbed in this one notion of retributionand of annihilation for the oppressors of his race and he regardedall things through a medium of revenge thus created by hisfeelings much as the missionary endeavored to bend every fact andcircumstance connected with the indians to the support of histheory touching their jewish origin</s> when peter arose therefore fierce and malignant passions were atwork in his bosom such as a merciful and a benignant deity neverwishes to see in the breast of man whether civilized or

not near the great lakes of sweet waterbut under the rising sun</s>  perhaps we shall wish to go home and toleave these pleasant openings for the pale faces to put their cabinson them as the smallpox

hardships and sufferings that havechanged your color</s> if suffering can do that returned peter with emphasis i wonderwe are not black</s>  when all our huntinggrounds are covered with thefarms of

whatwill happen except as it has been told to us in the word of god</s> you know that we palefaces have a book in which the great spirithas told us his laws and foretold to us many of the things that

during the whole of that excited and tumultuous scene which wouldprobably now be termed a stampede in the mexicanamericoenglishof the day peter had not stirred</s>  familiar with such occurrenceshe

equal</s>  it was peters intention to make himexercise his craft soon for the benefit of the chiefs and warriorspresent who might then return to their village carrying with themstores of honey to gladden the hearts of their squaws and pappooses</s> this artifice succeeded for the indians are not expert in takingthis article of food which so much abounds in the forests both onaccount of the

thought so</s> i thought so</s>  exclaimed the simpleminded andconfiding missionary</s>  how wonderful are the ways of god</s>  yes mybrother judea is a faroff land and your traditions say that

said this by way of throwing dust into the indianseyes for he had not the least intention of travelling in thedirection named</s>
 it is true it was his most direct course and theone that prudence would point out to him under all thecircumstances had he been alone</s>  but le bourdon was no longeralonein heart and feelings at

breaking their fasts included and then it was understoodthat all were to go forth to meet the chiefs that le bourdon mightgive a specimen of his craft</s> one ignorant of the state of political affairs on the americancontinent and who was not aware of the vicinity of savages wouldhave seen nothing that morning as the party proceeded on its littleexcursion in and around that remote spot but a picture of ruraltranquillity and peace</s>  a brighter day never poured its glories onthe face of the earth and the openings and the glades and eventhe dark and denser forests were all bathed in the sunlight asthat orb is known to illuminate objects in the softer season of theyear and in the fortythird degree of latitude</s>  even the birdsappeared to rejoice in the beauties of the time and sang andfluttered among the oaks in numbers greater than common</s>  natureusually observes a stern fitness in her adaptation of means to ends</s> birds are to be found in the forests on the prairies and

those of the old world</s>  this is true to acertain extent as respects those which are properly called forestbirds which do in general appear to partake of the sombrecharacter that marks the solemn

the corporal</s>  margery toowent along for as yet she had never seen an exhibition of bodenspeculiar skill</s>  as for gershom and his wife they remained behindto make ready the noontide meal while the chippewa took hisaccoutrements and again sallied out on a hunt</s>  the whole time ofthis indian appeared to be thus taken up though in truth venisonand bears meat both abounded and there was much less necessity forthose constant efforts than he wished to make it appear</s>  in goodsooth more than half his time was spent in making thoseobservations which had led to the advice he had been urging on hisfriend the beehunter in order to induce him to fly</s>  hadpigeonswing better understood peter and had he possessed a clearerinsight into the extent and magnitude of his plans of retributivevengeance it is not probable his uneasiness at the moment wouldhave been so great or the urgency for an immediate decision on thepart of le bourdon would have appeared as urgently pressing as itnow seemed to be</s> the beehunter took his way to a spot that was at some distance fromhis habitation a small prairie of circular form that is nowgenerally known in that region of the country by the name of prairieround</s>  three hours were necessary to reach it and this so much themore because margerys shorter steps were to be considered</s> margery however was no laggard on a path</s>  young active light offoot and trained in exertions of this nature her presence did notprobably retard the arrival many minutes</s> the extraordinary part of the proceedings was the circumstance thatthe beehunter did not tell any one whither he was going and thatpeter did not appear to care about putting the question to him</s> notwithstanding this reserve on one side and seeming indifferenceon the other when the party reached prairie round every one of thechiefs who had been present at the council of the previous nightwas there before it</s>  the indians were straggling about but remainedsufficiently near the point where the beehunter and his followersreached the prairie to assemble around the group in a very fewminutes after it made its appearance</s> all this struck le bourdon as fearfully singular since it provedhow many secret means of communication existed between the savages</s> that the inmates of the habitations were closely observed and alltheir proceedings noted he could not but suspect even beforereceiving this proof of peters power but he was not aware untilnow how completely he and all with him were at the mercy of theseformidable foes</s>  what hope could there be for escape when hundredsof eyes were thus watching their movements and every thicket hadits vigilant and sagacious sentinel</s>  yet must flight be attemptedin some way or other or margery and her sister would be hopelesslylostto say nothing of himself and the three other men</s> but the appearance of the remarkable little prairie that he had justreached and the collection of chiefs now occupied all the presentthoughts of le bourdon</s>  as for the first it is held in repute evenat the present hour as a place that the traveller should seethough covered with farms and the buildings that belong tohusbandry</s>  it is still visited as a picture of ancient civilizationplaced in the setting of a new country</s>  it is true that very littleof this part of michigan wears much if any of that aspect of arough beginning including stubs stumps and circled trees that ithas so often fallen to our share to describe</s>  there are denseforests and those of considerable extent and wherever the axe isput into them the progress of improvement is marked by the samesteps as elsewhere but the lovely openings form so many exceptionsas almost to compose the rule</s> on prairie round there was even a higher stamp of seemingcivilizationseeming since it was nature after all that hadmainly drawn the picture</s>  in the first place the spot had beenburnt so recently as to leave the entire expanse covered with younggrasses and flowers the same as if it were a wellkept park</s>  thisfeature at that advanced period of the summer was in some degreeaccidental the burning of the prairies depending more or less oncontingencies of that sort</s>  we have now less to do with the causethan with its consequences</s>  these were most agreeable to the eye aswell as comfortable to the foot the grass nowhere being of a heightto impede movement or what was of still more importance to lebourdons present pursuit to overshadow the flowers</s>  aware of thisfact he had led his companions all that distance to reach thisscene of remarkable rural beauty in order that he might make agrand display of his art in presence of the assembled chiefs ofthat region</s>  the beehunter had pride in his craft the same as anyother skilful workman who had gained a reputation by his cunningand he now trod the prairie with a firmer step and a more kindlingeye than was his wont in the commoner haunts of his calling</s>  menwere there whom it might be an honor to surprise and pretty margerywas there also she who had so long desired to see this veryexhibition</s> but to revert once more to the prairie ere we commence thenarrative of what occurred on it</s>  this wellknown area is of nogreat extent possessing a surface about equal to that of one of thelarger parks of europe</s>  its name was derived from its form whichwithout being absolutely regular had so near an approach to acircle as to justify the use of the appellation</s>  the face of thischarming field was neither waving or what is called rolling nora dead flat as often occurs with river bottoms</s>  it had just enoughof undulation to prevent too much moisture and to impart anagreeable variety to its plain</s>  as a whole it was clear of theforest quite as much so as if the axe had done its work there athousand years before though wood was not wanting</s>  on the contraryenough of the last was to be seen in addition to that which formedthe frame of this charming landscape to relieve the view from allappearance of monotony and to break it up into copses thicketstrees in small clusters and in most of the varieties that embellishnative scenery</s>  one who had been unexpectedly transferred to thespot might well have imagined that he was looking on the site ofsome old and longestablished settlement from which every applianceof human industry had been suddenly and simultaneously abstracted</s> of houses outbuildings fences stacks and husbandry there wereno signs unless the even and verdant sward that was spread like avast carpet sprinkled with flowers could have been deemed a signof the last</s>  there were the glades vistas irregular lawns andwoods shaped with the pleasing outlines of the free hand of natureas if consummate art had been endeavoring to imitate our greatmistress in one of her most graceful moods</s> the indians present served largely to embellish this scene</s>  of lateyears horses have become so common among the western tribes thevast natural meadows of those regions furnishing the means necessaryto keep them that one can now hardly form a picture of thosesavages without representing them mounted and wielding the spearbut such was not the fact with the time of which we are writing norwas it ever the general practice to go mounted among the indians inthe immediate vicinity of the great lakes</s>  not a hoof of any sortwas now visible with the exception of those which belonged to aherd of deer that were grazing on a favorite spot less than aleague distant from the place where le bourdon and his companionsreached the prairie</s>  all the chiefs were on foot and very few wereequipped with more than the knife and tomahawk the sidearms of achief the rifles having been secreted as it might be in deferenceto the festivities and peaceful character of the occasion</s>  as lebourdons party was duly provided with rifles the missionary andmargery excepted this was a sign that no violence was contemplatedon that occasion at least</s>  contemplated however is a word veryexpressive when used in connection with the outbreakings of humanpassions as they are wont to exhibit themselves among the ignorantand excited</s>  it matters not whether the scene be the capital of someancient european monarchy or the wilds of america the workings ofsuch impulses are much the same</s>  now a throne is overturnedperhaps before they who do it are yet fully aware of what theyought to set up in its place and now the deadly rifle or themurderous tomahawk is used more in obedience to the incentives ofdemons than in furtherance of justly recognized rules of conduct</s> le bourdon was aware of all this and did not so far confide inappearances as to overlook the watchfulness that he deemedindispensable</s> the beehunter was not long in selecting a place to set up hisapparatus</s>  in this particular he was mainly governed by a lovelyexpanse of sweetscented flowers among which bees in thousands werehumming sipping of their precious gifts at will</s>  le bourdon had acare also not to go far from the forests which encircled theprairies for among its trees he knew he had to seek the habitationsof the insects</s>  instead of a stump or a fallen tree he hadprepared a light framework of lath which the corporal bore to thefield for him and on which he placed his different implements assoon as he had selected the scene of operations</s> it will not be necessary for us to repeat the process which hasalready been described in our opening chapters but we shall onlytouch such parts of it as have a direct connection with the eventsof the legend</s>  as le bourdon commenced his preparations howeverthe circle of chiefs closed around him in mute but close attentionto everything that passed</s>  although every one of them had heard ofthe beehunters of the palefaces and most of them had heard ofthis particular individual of their number not an indian presenthad ever seen one of these men practise his craft</s>  this may seemstrange as respects those who so much roamed the woods but we havealready remarked that it exceeded the knowledge of the red man tomake the calculations that are necessary to take the bee by theprocess described</s>  usually when he obtains honey it is the resultof some chance meeting in the forest and not the fruits of thatfarsighted and persevering industry which enables the white man tolay in a store large enough to supply a neighborhood in the courseof a few weeks hunting</s> never was a juggler watched with closer attention than was lebourdon while setting up his stand and spreading his implements</s> every grave dark countenance was turned toward him and each keenglistening eye was riveted on his movements</s>  as the vessel with thecomb was set down the chiefs nearest recognizing the substancemurmured their admiration for to them it seemed as if the operatorwere about to make honey with honey</s>  then the glass was a subject ofsurprise for half of those present had never seen such an utensilbefore</s>  though many of the chiefs present had visited thegarrisons of the northwest both american and english many hadnot and of those who had not one in ten got any clear idea of thecommonest appliances of civilized life</s>  thus it was then thatalmost every article used by the beehunter though so simple andhomely was the subject of a secret but wellsuppressed admiration</s> it was not long ere le bourdon was ready to look for his bee</s>  theinsects were numerous on the flowers particularly on the whiteclover which is indigenous in america springing up spontaneouslywherever grasses are permitted to grow</s>  the great abundance of thebees however had its usual effect and our hero was a littledifficult to please</s>  at length a fine and already halfloadedlittle animal was covered by the glass and captured</s>  this was doneso near the group of indians that each and all noted the process</s> it was curious and it was inexplicable</s>  could the palefaces compelbees to reveal the secret of their hives and was that encroachingrace about to drive all the insects from the woods and seize theirhoney as they drove the indians before them and seized their lands</s> such was the character of the thoughts that passed through the mindsof more than one chief that morning though all looked on inprofound stillness</s> when the imprisoned bee was put over the comb and le bourdons capwas placed above all these simpleminded children of the woods andthe prairies gazed as if expecting a hive to appear beneath thecovering whenever the latter should be removed</s>  it was not longbefore the bee settled and not only the cap but the tumbler wastaken away</s>  for the first time since the exhibition commenced lebourdon spoke addressing himself to peter</s> if the tribeless chief will look sharply he said he will soonsee the bee take flight</s>  it is filling itself with honey and themoment it is loadedlooklookit is about to risethere it isupsee it circling around the stand as if to take a look that itmay know it againthere it goes</s> there it did go of a truth and in a regular beeline or asstraight as an arrow</s>  of all that crowd the beehunter and margeryalone saw the insect in its flight</s>  most of those present lost sightof it while circling around the stand but the instant it dartedaway to the remainder it seemed to vanish into air</s>  not so with lebourdon and margery however</s>  the former saw it from habit thelatter from a quick eye intense attention and the wish not to missanything that le bourdon saw fit to do for her information oramusement</s>  the animal flew in an airline toward a point of wooddistant fully half a mile and on the margin of the prairie</s> many low exclamations arose among the savages</s>  the bee was gone butwhither they knew not or on what errand</s>  could it have been sent ona message by the paleface or had it flown off to give the alarm toits companions in order to adopt the means of disappointing thebeehunter</s>  as for the last he went coolly to work to chooseanother insect and he soon had three at work on the comball incompany and all uncovered</s>  had the number anything to do with thecharm or were these three to be sent to bring back the one that hadalready gone away</s>  such was the sort of reasoning and such thequeries put to themselves by several of the stern children ofnature who were drawn up around the stand</s> in the mean time le bourdon proceeded with his operations in theutmost simplicity</s>  he now called peter and bears meat andcrowsfeather nearer to his person where they might share withmargery the advantage of more closely seeing all that passed</s>  assoon as these three chiefs were near enough ben pointed to one beein particular saying in the indian dialectmy brothers see that bee in the centrehe is about to go away</s>  ifhe go after the one that went before him i shall soon know where tolook for honey</s> how can my brother tell which bee will first fly away</s>  demandedbears meat</s> the beehunter was able to foresee this by knowing which insect hadbeen longest on the comb but so practised had his eye become thathe knew with tolerable accuracy by the movements of the creaturesthose that had filled themselves with honey from those that had not</s> as it did not suit his purpose however to let all the minutiae ofhis craft be known his answer was evasive</s>  just at that moment athought occurred to him which it might be well to carry out infull</s>  he had once saved his life by necromancy or what seemed tothe simple children of the woods to be necromancy and why might henot turn the cunning of his regular art to account and render itthe means of rescuing the females as well as himself from thehands of their captors</s>  this sudden impulse from that momentcontrolled his conduct and his mind was constantly casting aboutfor the means of effecting what was now his one great purposeescape</s>  instead of uttering in reply to bears meats question thesimple truth therefore he rather sought for such an answer asmight make the process in which he was engaged appear imposing andmystical</s> how do the injins know the path of the deer</s>  he asked by way ofreply</s>  they look at the deer get to know him and understand hisways</s>  this middle bee will soon fly</s> which way will he go</s>  asked peter</s>  can my brother tell us that</s> to his hive returned le bourdon carelessly as if he did notfully understand the question</s>  all of them go to their hivesunless i tell them to go in another direction</s>  see the bee is up</s> the chiefs now looked with all their eyes</s>  they saw indeed thatthe bee was making its circles above the stand</s>  presently they lostsight of the insect which to them seemed to vanish though lebourdon distinctly traced its flight for a hundred yards</s>  it took adirection at right angles to that of the first bee flying off intothe prairie and shaping its course toward an island of wood whichmight have been of three or four acres in extent and distant ratherless than a mile</s> while le bourdon was noting this flight another bee arose</s>  thiscreature flew toward the point of forest already mentioned as thedestination of the insect that had first risen</s>  no sooner was thisthird little animal out of sight than the fourth was up hummingaround the stand</s>  ben pointed it out to the chiefs and this timethey succeeded in tracing the flight for perhaps a hundred feetfrom the spot where they stood</s>  instead of following either of itscompanions this fourth bee took a course which led it off theprairie altogether and toward the habitations</s> the suddenly conceived purpose of le bourdon to attempt to mystifythe savages and thus get a hold upon their minds which he mightturn to advantage was much aided by the different directions takenby these several bees</s>  had they all gone the same way theconclusion that all went home would be so very natural and obviousas to deprive the discovery of a hive of any supernatural merit atleast and to establish this was just now the great object the beehunter had in view</s>  as it was the indians were no wiser now allthe bees were gone than they had been before one of them had flown</s> on the contrary they could not understand how the flights of somany insects in so many different directions should tell the beehunter where honey was to be found</s>  le bourdon saw that the prairiewas covered with bees and well knew that such being the fact theinmates of perhaps a hundred different hives must be present</s>  allthis however was too novel and too complicated for thecalculations of savages and not one of those who crowded near asobservers could account for so many of the bees going differentways</s> le bourdon now intimated a wish to change his ground</s>  he had notedtwo of the bees and the only question that remained to be decidedas it respected them was whether they belonged to the precisepoints toward which they had flown or to points beyond them</s>  thereader will easily understand that this is the nature of the factdetermined by taking an angle the point of intersection between anytwo of the lines of flight being necessarily the spot where the hiveis to be found</s>  so far from explaining this to those around himhowever boden kept it a secret in his own breast</s>  margery knew thewhole process for to her he had often gone over it in descriptionfinding a pleasure in instructing one so apt and whose tenderliquid blue eyes seemed to reflect every movement of his own souland feelings</s>  margery he could have taught forever or fancied forthe moment he could which is as near the truth as men under theinfluence of love often get</s>  but as for the indians so far fromletting them into any of his secrets his strong desire was now tothrow dust into their eyes in all possible ways and to make theirwellestablished character for superstition subservient to his ownprojects</s> boden was far from being a scholar even for one in his class inlife</s>  down to this hour the neglect of the means of publicinstruction is somewhat of a just ground of reproach against thevenerable and respectable commonwealth of which he was properly amember though her people have escaped a knowledge of a great dealof small philosophy and low intriguing which it is fair to presumethat evil spirits thrust in among the leaves of a more legitimateinformation when the book of knowledge is opened for theinstruction of those who by circumstances are prevented from doingmore than bestowing a few hurried glances at its contents</s>  stillben had read everything about bees on which he could lay his hands</s> he had studied their habits personally and he had pondered over thevarious accounts of their communitiesa sort of limited monarchy inwhich the prince is deposed occasionally or when matters go verywrongsome written by really very observant and intelligentpersons and others again not a little fanciful</s>  among other booksthat had thus fallen in le bourdons way was one which somewhatminutely described the uses that were made of bees by the ancientsoothsayers in their divinations</s>  our hero had no notion of revivingthose rites or of attempting to imitate the particular practices ofwhich he had read and heard but the recollection of them occurredmost opportunely to strengthen and encourage the design so suddenlyentertained of making his

ofintellectual qualities</s> sometimes</s>  palefaces have gone to bees to ask what will happen</s> let me ask our medicineman this question</s>  parson amen have you anyknowledge of the soothsayers

happenedto be one of the number</s>  of virgil for instance parson amen knewbut little though in the progress of a very loose but industriouscourse of reading he had learned that the soothsayers put greatfaith in bees</s>  his answer was given in conformity with this factand in the most perfect good faith for he had not the smallestsuspicion of what boden wished to establish</s> certainlymost certainly answered the wellmeaning missionarythe fortunetellers of old times often went to their bees when theywished to look into the future</s>  it has been a subject much talked ofamong christians to account for the soothsaying and witchcraftand other supernatural dealings of those who lived in the times ofthe prophets and most of them have held the opinion that evilspirits have beennay still are permitted to work their will oncertain men in the flesh</s>  but bees were in much favor with thesoothsayers of old</s> this answer was given in english and little of it was comprehendedby peter and the others who had more or less knowledge of thatlanguage beyond the part which asserted the agency of bees inwitchcraft</s>  luckily this was all le bourdon desired and he waswell satisfied at seeing that the idea passed from one chief toanother those who did not know the english at all being told bythose who had some knowledge of the tongue that bees were thoughtto be medicine among the palefaces</s> le bourdon gained a great deal of ground by this fortunatecorroboration of his own still more fortunate thought matters werepretty nearly desperate with him and with all his friends

 to kill a bear is the most honorable thing ahunter can do as we all know</s>  if my brother wishes to hear it iwill ask my bees when he is to kill another</s> the savage to whom this was addressed

easily admit of denial</s>  it wasapparent to le bourdon that this mysterious indian was not contentthat one so direct and impetuous in his feelings as bears meat andwho was at the same time so little qualified to manage his portionof an intellectual conversation should be foremost any longer</s>  forthat reason he brought himself more into the foreground leaving tohis friend the capacity of

menacingmanner and moved cautiously from side to side like one of his kindthat scents a foe</s>  there was no mistaking these movements and allthe principal chiefs soon had their attention also drawn

bourdon advanced followed by peter bears meatand crowsfeather</s>  our hero had made up his mind that something morethan bees were to be found in the thicket for the place being alittle marshy bushes

accustomed to such struggles he had noapprehensions and led the way boldly feeling the necessity ofmanifesting perfect confidence in all his own acts in order tocommand the respect of the observers</s>  as soon as the beehunterpassed the dog the latter growled showed his teeth fiercely andfollowed keeping closely at his side</s>  the confidence and alacritywith which le bourdon moved into the thicket compelled hiscompanions to be on the alert though the first broke through thebelt of hazels which enclosed the more open area within a fewinstants before the indians reached the

to leap and play theirantics amid the trees</s>  the sudden spectacle of a crowd of suchbeings nearly naked frightfully painted and tossing their armshere and there while each yelled like a demon was enough toovercome the nerves of a very resolute man</s>  but le bourdon wasprepared for a conflict and even felt relieved rather than alarmedwhen he saw the savages</s>  his ready mind at once conceived the truth</s> this band belonged to the chiefs and composed the whole or aprincipal part of the force which he knew they must have outlyingsomewhere on the prairies or in the openings</s>  he had sufficientlyunderstood the hints of pigeonswing to be prepared for such ameeting and at no time of late had he approached a cover withoutremembering the possibility of its containing indians</s> instead of betraying alarm therefore when this cloud of phantomlike beings rose before his eyes le bourdon stood firm merelyturning toward the chiefs behind him to ascertain if they weretaken by surprise as well as himself</s>  it was apparent that theywere for understanding that a medicineceremony was to take placeon the prairie these young men had preceded the party from the hutand had ununknown to all the chiefs got possession of this copseas the best available cover whence to make their observations onwhat was going on</s> my brother sees his young men said le bourdon

brother wish to knowanything else</s> great was the wonder of the three chiefs at this exhibition ofmedicine power</s>  so far from suspecting the truth or of detectingthe lucky coincidence by which le bourdon had been led to the coverof their warriors it all appeared to them to be pure necromancy</s> such an art must be of great service and how useful it would be tothe warrior on his path to be accompanied by one who could thuscommand the vigilance of the bees</s> you find enemy all same as friend</s>  demanded peter letting out thethought that was uppermost in the question</s> to be

when the chiefs followedby the whole band of warriors some three or four hundred in numbercame out upon the open prairie all that had passed was communicatedto those who awaited their return in a few brief but clearexplanations</s>  le bourdon found a moment to let margery comprehendhis position and views while parson amen and the corporal were putsufficiently on their guard not to make any unfortunate blunder</s>  thelast was much more easily managed than the first</s>  so exceedinglysensitive was the conscience of the priest that had he clearlyunderstood the game le bourdon was playing

bees</s>  in thisrespect he and the indians equally resembled one of those familiarpictures in which we daily see men in masses contributing totheir own deception and subjection while they fondly but

known to the beehunter bymeans of that very simple and everyday process by which he earnedhis bread</s>  one of these hives was in the point of wood alreadymentioned that lay along the margin of the prairie while the otherwas in this very copse where the savages had secreted themselves</s> boden had now no thought of giving any further disturbance to thislastnamed colony of insects for an insight into their existencemight disturb the influence obtained by the jugglery of the latediscovery and he at once turned his attention toward the other hiveindicated by his bees</s> nor did le bourdon now deem it necessary to resort to his usualmeans of carrying on his trade</s>  these were not necessary to one whoknew already where the hive was to be found while it opened the wayto certain mummeries

agency in bringing about events and may havebeen intended to be a part of that moral machinery which was now atwork in the breast of peter for good</s> it will be remembered that the beehunter habitually carried a smallspyglass as a part of the implements of his calling</s>  it enabledhim to watch the bees as they went in and came out of the hives onthe highest trees and often saved him hours of fruitless search</s> this glass was now in his hand for an object on a dead tree thatrose a little apart from those around it and which stood quite nearthe extreme point in the forest toward

compel him tofall back again</s>  all this was favorable to le bourdons wishes whoimmediately called a halt</s>  the first thing that bourdon did whenall the dark eyes were gleaming on him in fierce

as all this was very simple and easily to be comprehended not amoment was lost in the execution</s>  with surprising order andaptitude the chiefs led off their parties one line of darkwarriors

down to one of venison or bears meat or bisons humpswith the exception of the professed hunters and trappers few knewmore about them all than he did himself</s>  that the deer or even theantelopes of america ever had been goats he did not believe norwas he at all backward in letting his dissent to such a theory beknown</s> im sorry parson amen youve brought in the deer he cried</s>  hadyou stuck to the jews i might have believed all that you fancy inthis business but the deer have spoiled all</s>  as for scapegoatssince margery seems to agree with you i suppose you are right aboutthem though my notion of such creatures has been to keep clear ofthem instead of following them up as you seem to think thesehebrews have done</s>  but if you are no nearer right in your doctrineabout the injins

a devout christian</s>  there are more reasons than you may at firstsuppose for believing in this theory of the gradual change of thegoat into the deer and especially into the antelope</s>  we do not

but to this le bourdon himselfwas not much inclined</s>  it had struck him that gershom was opposed toan early marriage most probably because he fancied himself moresecure of the beehunters ingenious

and nature and warmheartedinterest in all around her had failed to make any impression on hismarblelike feelings while the beehunters habits skill in hiscraft and close connection with himself at the mouth of the riverand more especially in liberating him from his enemies had unitedhim in a comrades friendship with her husband</s>  it was a littlesingular that this chippewa did not fall into peters superstitiousdread of the beehunters necromancy though he was aware of allthat had passed the previous day on the prairie</s>  either on accountof his greater familiarity with le bourdons

at hand</s>  had le bourdon been as disconnected andsolitary as he was when he first met the chippewa it is notprobable that either the words or the manner of his friend wouldhave produced much

alarm or bestow his confidence accordingly</s> le bourdon was not left long in doubt</s>  peter arrived about halfanhour after pigeonswing had gone to seek his rest and from theinstant he came in

peter then related in full his attempt to procure a safe passage forle bourdon and margery into the settlements and its total failure</s> he owned that by his previous combinations he had awakened a spiritamong the indians that his present efforts could not quell</s>  in aword he told the whole story as it must have been made apparent tothe reader and he now came with his plans to defeat the

destructive to all the whites</s>  the difficulty arose from anaive confession of peters that he did not even wish to save anybut le bourdon and margery and that he still desired the deaths ofall the

that gave a graphic reality toall he said</s>  as if his task was done the mysterious chief nowcoolly arose and moved away to a little grove in which themissionary and the corporal had thrown themselves on the grasswhere they lay speculating on the probable course that the bands intheir neighborhood would next pursue</s>  so thoroughly possessed wasthe clergyman with his one idea however

it passed</s>  so cold was hismanner however and so indifferent did he seem that no one wouldhave suspected that he knew aught of what was in contemplation</s> having satisfied himself that his friend the beehunter was notone of those who followed peter the chippewa turned coldly awayand began to examine the flint of his rifle</s>  the corporal noted thismanner and it gave him additional confidence to proceed for hecould not imagine that any human being would manifest so muchindifference when sinister designs existed</s> peter turned neither to the right hand nor to the left until he hadled the way down upon the little arena of bottomland alreadydescribed and which was found well sprinkled with savages</s>  a fewstood or sat about in groups earnestly conversing but most layextended at length on the green sward in the indolent repose thatis so grateful to an indian warrior in his hours of inaction</s>  thearrival of peter however instantly put a new face on theappearance of matters</s>  every man started to his feet and additionswere made to those who were found in the arena by those who came outof the adjacent thickets until some two or three hundred of the redmen were assembled in a circle around the newlyarrived palefaces</s> there said peter sternly fastening his eye with a hostileexpression on bough of the oak and ungque in particularthere areyour captives</s>  do with them

the willof the manitou</s> the missionary understood all that was said and he was not a littleappalled at the aspect of things</s>  for the first time he began toapprehend that he was in danger</s>  so much was this devout and wellintentioned servant of his church accustomed to place his dependenceon a superintending providence that apprehension of personalsuffering seldom had any influence on his exertions</s>  he believedhimself to be an object of especial care though he was ever readyto admit that the wisdom which human minds cannot compass mightorder events that at first sight would seem to be opposed to thatwhich ought to be permitted to come to pass</s>  in this particularparson amen was a model of submission firmly believing that allthat happened was in furtherance of the great scheme of mansregeneration and eventual salvation</s> with the corporal it was very different</s>  accustomed to war with redmen and most acquainted with them in their worst character he eversuspected treachery and had followed peter with a degree ofreluctance he had not cared to express</s>  he now thoroughly took thealarm however and stood on his guard</s>  although he did notcomprehend more than half of that which peter had said heunderstood quite enough to see that he and the missionary weresurrounded by enemies if not by executioners</s> we have fallen into a sort of

sees to the rear</s> place your back close to mine and take the left flank into yourpart of the lookout</s>  closer closer my good sir we must standsolid as rooted trees to make anything of a stand</s> the missionary in his surprise permitted the corporal to assumethe position described though conscious of its uselessness in theiractual condition</s>  as for the indians the corporals manner and therattling of his arms induced the circle to recede several pacesthough nothing like alarm prevailed among them</s>  the effectnevertheless was to leave the two captives space for

to take breath</s>  theallusion to wayne and his defeat of the indians excited so muchire that several hands grasped knives and tomahawks and one arrowwas actually drawn nearly to the head but the frown of bears meatprevented any outbreak or actual violence</s>  it was deemed prudenthowever to put an end to this scene lest the straightforwardcorporal who laid it on heavily and who had so much to say aboutindian defeats might actually succeed in touching some festeringwound that would bring him to his death at once</s>
 it wasaccordingly determined to proceed with the torture of the saplingswithout further delay</s> the corporal was removed accordingly and placed between the twobended trees which were kept together by withes around their tops</s> an arm of the captive was bound tightly at the wrist to the top ofeach tree so that his limbs were to act as the only tie between thesaplings as soon as the withes should be cut</s>  the indians nowworked in silence and the matter was getting to be much too seriousfor the corporal to indulge in any more words</s>  the cold sweatreturned and many an anxious

him by thisfriendly blow</s> it was so much a matter of course for an indian to revenge his ownwoundsto alleviate his smarts by retaliating on those whoinflicted themthat the chiefs expressed neither surprise norresentment at the manner of the corporals death</s>  there was somedisappointment it is true but no anger was manifested since itwas supposed that some one of those whom the prisoner had woundedhad seen fit in this mode to revenge his own hurts</s>  in thishowever the indians deceived themselves</s>  the wellintentioned anddeadly shot that saved the corporal from hours of agony came fromthe friendly hand of pigeonswing who had no sooner discharged hisrifle than he stole away through the thicket and was neverdiscovered</s>  this he did too at the expense of ungques scalp onwhich he had set his heart</s> as for the indians perceiving that their hopes of forcing a captiveto confess his weakness were frustrated they conferred together onthe course of future proceedings</s>  there was an inquiry for peterbut peter was not to be found</s>  bough of the oak suggested that themysterious chief must have gone to the palisaded hut in order toget the remaining scalps his passion

bears meat collected his principal chiefs and after aconsiderable amount of consultation it was determined in thepresent instance to try the virtue of fire</s>  the only sign of lifethey could detect about the hut was an occasional bark from hivewho had been taken within the building most probably to protect himfrom the bullets and arrows of the enemy</s>  even this animal did nothowl like a dog

halfdecided that she should bespared to be carried to his own lodge as an adopted daughter</s>  whenhe became aware of the state of things between his favorite and herlover there was a severe struggle in his breast on the subject ofsparing the last</s>  he saw how strongly the girl was attached to himand something like human sentiments forced their way among hissavage plans</s>  the mysterious communication of le bourdon with thebees however had far more influence in determining him to spare sogreat a medicineman than margerys claims and he had endeavoredto avail himself of a marriage as a means of saving the brideinstead of saving the bridegroom</s>  all the indians entertained aspecies of awe for le bourdon and all hesitated about laying handson one who appeared so gifted</s>  it was therefore the expectation ofthis extraordinary being that the wife might be permitted to escapewith the husband</s>  the effect of the weasels cunning has beendescribed</s>  such was the state of peters mind when he met the bandin the scenes last described</s>  there he had been all attention to thedemeanor of the missionary</s>  a hundred times had he seen warriors dieuttering maledictions on their enemies but this was the firstoccasion on which he had ever known a man to use his latest breathin asking for blessings on those who persecuted him</s>  at firstpeter was astounded</s>  then the sublime principles had their effectand his heart was deeply touched with what he heard</s>  how far theholy spirit aided these better feelings it might be presumptuouson the one hand to say while on the other it will be equallypresuming to think of denying the possibilitynay the probabilitythat the great change which so suddenly came over the heart ofpeter was produced by more than mere human agencies</s>  we know thatthis blessed spirit is often poured out in especial cases withaffluent benevolence and there can be no sufficient reason forsupposing this savage might not have been thus signally favored assoon as the avenues of his heart opened to the impulses of agenerous humanity</s>  the very qualities that would induce such a beingto attempt the wild and visionary scheme of vengeance andretribution that had now occupied his sleeping and waking thoughtsfor years might under a better direction render him eminently fitto be the subject of divine grace</s>  a latent sense of right laybehind all his seeming barbarity and that which to us appears as afell ferocity was in his own eyes no less than a severe justice</s> the words the principles the prayers and more than all theexample of the missionary wrought this great change so far ashuman agencies were employed but the power of god was necessary tocarry out and complete this renewal of the inner man</s>  we do not meanthat a miracle was used in the sudden conversion of this indian tobetter feelings for that which is of hourly occurrence and whichmay happen to all comes within the ordinary workings of a divineprovidence and cannot thus be designated with propriety but we dowish to be understood as saying that no purely human power couldhave cleared the moral vision changed all the views and softenedthe heart of such a man as was so promptly done in the case ofpeter</s>  the way had been gradually preparing perhaps by the meansalready described but the great transformation came so suddenly andso powerfully as to render him a different being as it might almostbe in the twinkling of an eye</s>  such changes often occur and thoughit may suit the selfsufficiency of the worldling to deride them heis the wisest who submits in the meekest spirit to powers thatexceed his comprehension</s> in this state of mind then peter left the band as soon as the fateof the missionary was decided</s>  his immediate object was to save thewhites who remained gershom and dorothy now having a place in hisgood intentions as well as le bourdon and margery</s>  although hemoved swiftly and nearly by an airline his thoughts scarce keptcompany with his feet</s>  during that rapid walk he was haunted withthe image of a man dying while he pronounced benedictions on hisenemies</s> there was little in common between the natural objects of thatplacid and rural scene and the fell passions that were so activelyat work among the savages</s>  the whole of the landscape was bathed inthe light of a clear warm summers day</s>  these are the times whenthe earth truly seems a sanctuary in spots remote from the hauntsof men and least exposed to his abuses</s>  the bees hum around theflowers the birds carol on the boughs and from amid their leafyarbors while even the leaping and shining waters appear to beinstinct with the life that extols the glory of god</s> as for the family near the palisaded hut happiness had not formany a month been so seated among them as on this very occasion</s> dorothy sympathized truly in the feelings of the youthful andcharming bride while gershom had many of the kind and affectionatewishes of a brother in her behalf</s>  the last was in his best attireas indeed were the females who were neatly though modestly cladand gershom had that air of decent repose and of quiet enjoymentwhich is so common of a sabbath with the men of his class among thepeople from whom he sprung</s>  the fears lately excited weremomentarily forgotten</s>  everything around them wore an air so placidthe vault above them was so profoundly tranquil the light of daywas so soft and yet so bright the openings seemed so rural and somuch like pictures of civilization that apprehension had beenentirely forgotten in present enjoyment</s>  such was the moment whenpeter suddenly stood before le bourdon and margery as the youngcouple sat beneath the shade of the oaks near the spring</s>  oneinstant the indian regarded this picture of young wedded life with agleam of pleasure on his dark face then he announced his presenceby speaking</s> cant sit here lookin at

feet</s>  you come like a runner rushing in with his bad tidings</s> has anything happened to give an alarm</s> up and off tell you</s>  no use talkin now</s>  put all he can in canoeand paddle away fast as can</s>  there was no mistaking peters manner</s> the beehunter saw the uselessness of questioning such a man at atime like that and he called to gershom to join him</s> here is the chief to warn us to move said the beehunterendeavoring to appear calm in order that he might not needlesslyalarm the females and what he advises we had better do</s>  i knowthere is danger by what has fallen from pigeonswing as well as fromhimself so let us lose no time but stow the canoes and do as hetells us</s> as gershom assented it was not two minutes ere all were at work</s> for several days each canoe had been furnished with provisions fora hasty flight</s>  it remained only to add such of the effects as weretoo valuable and necessary to be abandoned and which had not beenpreviously exposed without the palisades</s>  for half an hour lebourdon and gershom worked as for life</s>  no questions were asked norwas a single moment lost in a desire to learn more</s>  the manner inwhich peter bore himself satisfied boden that the emergency waspressing and it is seldom that more was done by so few hands in soshort a period</s>  fortunately the previous preparation greatly aidedthe present object and nearly everything of any value was placed inthe canoes within the brief space mentioned</s>  it then becamenecessary to decide concerning the condition in which castle mealwas to be left</s>  peter advised closing every aperture shutting thegate and leaving the dog within</s>  there is no doubt that theseexpedients prevented the parties falling early into the hands oftheir enemies for the time lost by the savages in making theirapproaches to the hut was very precious to the fugitives</s> just as the canoes were loaded pigeonswing came in</s>  he announcedthat the whole band was in motion and might be expected to reachthe grove in ten minutes</s>  placing an arm around the slender waist ofmargery le bourdon almost carried her to his own canoe gershomsoon had dorothy in his little bark while peter entered that to theownership of which he may be said to have justly succeeded by thedeaths of the corporal and the missionary</s>  pigeonswing remainedbehind in order to act as a scout having first communicated topeter the course the last ought to steer</s>  before the chippewaplunged into the cover in which it was his intention to concealhimself he made a sign that the band was already in sightthe heart of le bourdon sunk within him when he learned how nearwere the enemy</s>  to him escape seemed impossible and he nowregretted having abandoned the defences of his late residence</s>  theriver was sluggish for more than a mile at that spot and thenoccurred a rift which could not be passed without partly unloadingthe canoes and where there must necessarily be a detention of morethan an hour</s>  thus it was scarcely possible for canoes descendingthat stream to escape from so large a band of pursuers</s>  thesinuosities themselves would enable the last to gain fifty pointsahead of them where ambushes or even open resistance must placethem altogether at the mercy of the savages</s> peter knew all this as well as the beehunter and he had nointention of trusting his new friends in a flight down the river</s> pigeonswing with the sententious brevity of an indian had made animportant communication to him while they were moving for the lasttime toward the canoes and he now determined to profit by it</s> taking the lead therefore with his own canoe peter paddled upinstead of down the stream going in a direction opposite to thatwhich it would naturally be supposed the fugitives had taken</s>  indoing this also he kept close under the bank which would mostconceal the canoes from those who approached it on its southernside</s> it will be remembered that the trees for the palisades had been cutfrom a swamp a short distance above the beehunters residence</s> they had grown on the margin of the river which had been foundserviceable in floating the logs to their point of destination</s>  thetops of many of these trees resinuous and suited by their natureto preserve their leaves for a considerable time lay partly in thestream and partly on its banks and pigeonswing foreseeing thenecessity of having a place of refuge had made so artful adisposition of several of them that while they preserved all theappearance of still lying where they had fallen it was possible tohaul canoes up beneath them between the branches and the bank in away to form a place of perfect concealment</s>  no indian would havetrusted to such a hidingplace had it not been matter of notorietythat the trees had been felled for a particular purpose or hadtheir accidental disposition along the bank been discerniblyderanged</s>  but such was not the case the hand of pigeonswing havingbeen so skilfully employed that what he had done could not bedetected</s>  he might be said to have assisted nature instead ofdisturbing her</s> the canoes were actually paddling close under the bank in thecastle meal reach of the river when the band arrived at the groveand commenced what might be called the investment of the place</s>  hadnot all the attention of the savages been drawn toward the hut itis probable that some wandering eye might have caught a glimpse ofsome one of them as inequalities in the bank momentarily exposedeach in succession to view</s>  this danger however passed away andby turning a point the fugitives were effectually concealed fromall who did not actually approach the river at that particularpoint</s>  here it was however that the swamp commenced and theground being wet and difficult no one would be likely to do this</s> the stream flowed through this swamp having a dense wood on eachside though one of no great extent</s>  the reach moreover was shortmaking a completely sheltered haven of the kalamazoo within itslimits</s> once in this wooded reach peter tossed an arm and assumed an airof greater security</s>  he felt infinitely relieved and knew that theywere safe for a time unless some wanderer should have taken to theswampa most improbable thing of itself</s>  when high enough he ledthe way

isdesirable for meadows and pastures</s>  we apprehend this is truehowever less as a rule than as exceptions there being variety inthe soils of these openings as well as in other quarters</s>

their place of concealment was but little more than aquarter of a mile and the yell of the savages had often reachedtheir ears notwithstanding the cover of the woods</s>  this proximityof itself was fearful but the uncertainty that le bourdon felt onthe subject of peters real intentions added greatly to his causesof concern</s>  of course he knew but little of the sudden change thathad come over

true colors what had actuallyoccurred</s>  with margery it was different</s>  her schooling had been farbetter than that of any other of the party and while she admiredthe manly appearance and loved the free generous character of herhusband she had more than once felt pained at the passing thoughtsof his great indifference to sacred things</s>  this feeling in lebourdon however was passive rather than active and gave her akind interest in his future welfare rather than any present painthrough acts and words</s> but as respects their confidence in peter this young couple weremuch farther apart than in their religious notions</s>  the beehunterhad never been without distrust though his apprehensions had beenoccasionally so far quieted as to leave him nearly free of themaltogether while his wife had felt the utmost confidence in thechief from the very commencement of their acquaintance</s>  it would beuseless perhaps to attempt to speculate on the causes but it iscertain that there are secret sources of sympathy that drawparticular individuals toward each other and antipathies that keepthem widely separated</s>  men shall meet for the first time and feelthemselves attracted toward

suitable age and character for heramerican notions on the subject of color might have interposeddifficulties but apart from the tender sentiments she could seegood and bad qualities in one of the aborigines as well as in awhite man</s>  as a consequence of this sympathy between peter andmargery the last had ever felt the utmost confidence in theprotection and friendship of the first</s>  this she did even while thestruggle was going on in his breast on the subject of including herin his fell designs or of making an exception in her favor</s>  itshows the waywardness of our feelings that

swamp near their place ofconcealment</s>  just at that spot the bank of the river was higherthan in most of the low land and was dry with a soil thatapproached sand</s>  this was the place where the few young pines hadgrown</s>  the dry ground might have covered four or five acres and somany trees having been felled light and air were admitted in a wayto render the place comparatively

possible though it wasexceedingly difficult to make his way through it</s>  he ascertainedthe fact however since it might be important to their futuremovements to know it</s> in a word le bourdon made a complete reconnaissance of hisposition</s>  he cleared a spot for the females and made a sort of hutthat would serve as a protection against rain and in which they allmight sleep at night</s>  there was little doubt that this place must beoccupied for some days if peter was acting in good faith since anearly movement would infallibly lead to detection</s>  time must begiven to the indians to

thatthe chippewa did not heedlessly vaunt the quality of his prize</s>  whatwas more so accurately had he calculated the time and the means ofsubsistence in the possession of the fugitives that his

all this we find the same propensity among ourselves</s>  thecommon mind ever subject to these impulses looks rather to suchexploits as address themselves to the senses and the imaginationthan to those qualities which the reason alone can best appreciateand in this ignorance asserts its negative power over allconditions of life</s> pigeonswing now condescended to enter on such explanations as thestate of the case rendered necessary</s>  his account was sufficientlyclear and it manifested throughout the sagacity and shrewdness of apractised hunter and scout</s>  we shall not attempt to give his wordswhich would require too much space but the substance of his storywas briefly thisas has been alluded to already the principal chiefs on asuggestion of bears meat had followed the young men down thekalamazoo dividing themselves by a part of their bodys crossingthe stream at the first favorable spot</s>  in this way the indiansproceeded sweeping the river before them and examining every placethat seemed capable of concealing a canoe</s>  runners were kept inconstant motion between the several parties in order to let thestate of the search be known to all and feigning to be one ofthese very men pigeonswing had held communication with several whomhe purposely met and to whom he imparted such invented informationas contributed essentially to send the young men forward on a falsescent</s>  in this way the main body of the savages descended the riversome sixty miles following its windings in the first day and ahalf</s>  here pigeonswing left them turning his own face up stream inorder to rejoin his friends</s>  of peter he had no knowledge neitherknowing nor otherwise learning what had become of the great chief</s> on his way up stream pigeonswing met several more indians runnerslike himself or as he seemed to be or scouts kept on the lookoutfor the fugitives</s>  he had no difficulty in deceiving these men</s>  noneof them had been of crowsfeathers party and he was a stranger tothem all</s>  ignorant of his real character they received hisinformation without distrust and the orders he pretended to conveywere obeyed by them without the smallest hesitation</s>  in this waythen pigeonswing contrived to send all the scouts he met away fromthe river by telling them that there was reason to think the palefaces had abandoned the stream and that it was the wish of bearsmeat that their trail should be looked for in the interior</s>  this wasthe false direction that he gave to all thereby succeeding bettereven than he had hoped in clearing the banks of the kalamazoo ofobservers and foes</s>  nevertheless many of those whom he knew to beout some quite in the rear of the party and others in its frontand at no great distance from them he did not meet of course hecould not get his false directions to their ears</s>  there were infact so many of the indians and so few of the whites that it wasan easy matter to cover the path with young warriors any one partyof whom would be strong enough to capture two men and as many women</s> having told the tale of his own doings pigeonswing next came to hisproposition for the mode of future proceeding</s>  he proposed that thefamily should get into the canoes that very night and commence itsflight by going down the stream directly toward its foes</s>  thissounded strangely but there did not seem to be any alternative</s>  amarch across the peninsula would be too much for the females andthere was the certainty that their trail would be found</s>  it may seemstrange to those who are unacquainted with the american indian andhis habits to imagine that in so large an expanse the signs ofthe passage of so small a party might not escape detection but suchwas the case</s>  to one unaccustomed to the vigilance and intelligenceof these savages it must appear just as probable that the vesselcould be followed through the wastes of the ocean by means of itswake as that the footprints should be so indelible as to furnishsigns that can be traced for days</s>  such however is the fact andno one understood it better than the chippewa</s>  he was also awarethat the country toward ohio whither the fugitives would naturallydirect their course now that the english were in possession ofdetroit must soon be a sort of battleground to which most of thewarriors of that region would eagerly repair</s>  under all thecircumstances therefore he advised the flight by means of theriver</s>  le bourdon reasoned on all he heard and still entertainingsome of his latent distrust of peter and willing to get beyond hisreach he soon acquiesced in the proposition and came fully intothe plan</s> it was now necessary to reload the canoes</s>  this was done in thecourse of the day and every arrangement was made so as to be readyfor a start as soon as the darkness set in</s>  everybody was glad tomove though all were aware of the extent of the hazard they ran</s> the females in particular felt their hearts beat as each in herhusbands canoe issued out of the cover into the open river</s> pigeonswing took the lead paddling with a slow but steady sweep ofhis arm and keeping as close as was convenient to one bank</s>  byadopting this precaution he effectually concealed the canoes fromthe eyes of all on that side of the river unless they stooddirectly on its margin and had the aid of the shadows to helpconceal them from any who might happen to be on the other</s>  in thisway then the party proceeded passing the site of the hut and thegrove of openings around it undetected</s>  as the river necessarilyflowed through the lowest land its banks were wooded much of theway which afforded great protection to the fugitives and this somuch the more because these woods often grew in swamps where thescouts would not be likely to resort</s> about midnight the canoes reached the first rift</s>  an hour was lostin unloading and in reloading the canoes and in passing thedifficulties at that point</s>  as soon as this was done the party reembarked and resorted once more to the use of the paddle in orderto gain a particular sheltered reach of the river previously to thereturn of light</s>  this was effected successfully and the partylanded</s> it now appeared that pigeonswing had chosen another swamp as a placeof concealment for the fugitives to use during the day</s>  theseswamps through which the river wound its way in short reaches wereadmirably adapted to such purposes</s>  dark sombre and hardlypenetrable on the side of the land they were little likely to beentered after a first examination</s>  nor was it at all probable thatfemales in particular would seek a refuge in such a place</s>  but thechippewa had found the means to obviate the natural obstacles of thelow land</s>  there were several spots where the water from the riverset back into the swamp forming so many little creeks and into thelargest of one of these he pushed his canoe the others followingwhere he led</s>  by resorting to such means the shelter now obtainedwas more complete perhaps than that previously leftpigeonswing forced his light boat up the shallow inlet

torevive the confidence of le bourdon</s>  he could not think the dangervery great so long as one so experienced as the chippewa felt somuch confidence in his own future proceedings and after talking ashort time longer with this man the beehunter went to seekmargery in order to impart to her a due portion of his own hopes</s> the sisters were preparing the breakfast</s>  this was done without theuse of fire it being too hazardous to permit smoke to rise abovethe tops of the trees</s>  many is the camp that has been discovered bythe smoke which can be seen at a great distance and it is

andwhich all at once impute to their true origin</s>  the danger of usingfire had been so much guarded against by our fugitives that thecooking of the party had been done at night the utmost cautionhaving been used to prevent the fire itself from being seen andcare taken to extinguish it long before the return of day</s>  a supplyof cold meat was always on hand and had it not been the fugitiveswould have known how to live on berries or at need to fastanything was preferable being exposed to certain capture</s> as soon as the party had broken their fast arrangements were madefor recruiting nature by sleep</s>  as for pigeonswing indianlike hehad eaten enormously no reasonable quantity of venison sufficing toappease his appetite and when he had eaten he lay down in thebottom of his canoe and slept</s>  similar dispositions were made oftheir persons by the rest and half an hour after the meal wasended all there were in a profound sleep</s>  no watch was considerednecessary and none was kept</s> the rest of the weary is sweet</s>  long hours passed ere any one thereawoke but no sooner did the chippewa move than all the rest wereafoot</s>  it was now late in the day and it was time to think oftaking the meal that was to sustain them through the toil andfatigues of another arduous night</s>  this was done the necessarypreparations being made for a start ere the sun

proceeding</s> no sooner did the shades of evening close around the place than thefugitives again put forth</s>  the night was clouded and dark and somuch of the way now lay through forests that there was little reasonto apprehend detection</s>  the chief causes of delay were the riftsand the portages as had been the case the night before</s>  luckily lebourdon had been up and down the stream so often as to be a verytolerable pilot in its windings</s>  he assumed the control and bymidnight the greatest obstacle to that evenings progress wasovercome</s>  at the approach of day pigeonswing pointed out anothercreek in another swamp where the party found a refuge for thesucceeding day</s>  in this manner four nights were passed on the riverand as many days in swamps without discovery</s>  the chippewa hadnicely calculated his time and his distances and not the smallestmistake was made</s>  each morning a place of shelter was reached insufficient season and each night the fugitives were ready for thestart as the day shut in</s>  in this manner most of the river wasdescended until a distance that could be easily overcome in acouple of hours of paddling alone remained between the party

indeed theescape was so narrow as to be worth recording</s> it was at a spot where the stream flowed through a forest denserthan common that pigeonswing heard voices on the river ahead ofhim</s>  one indian was calling to another asking to be set across thestream in a canoe</s>  it was too late to retreat and so muchuncertainty existed as to the nearness or distance of the dangerthat the chippewa deemed it safest to bring all three of his canoestogether and to let them float past the point suspected or ratherknown to be occupied by enemies</s>  this was done with the utmostcare</s>  the plan succeeded though not without running a very greatrisk</s>  the canoes did float past unseen though there was a minute oftime when le bourdon fancied by the sounds that savages were talkingto each other within a hundred feet of his ears</s>  additionalsecurity however was felt in consequence of the circumstancesince the pursuers must imagine the river below them to be free fromthe pursued</s> the halt that morning was made earlier than had been the practicepreviously</s>  this was done because the remaining distance was sosmall that in continuing to advance the party would have incurredthe risk of reaching the mouth of the river by daylight</s>  this was tobe avoided on every account but principally because it was of greatimportance to conceal from the savages the direction taken</s>  were thechiefs certain that their intended victims were on lake michigan itwould be possible for them to send parties across the isthmus thatshould reach points on lake huron days in advance of the arrival ofthe beehunter and his friends in the vicinity of saginaw or pointeaux barques for instance and where the canoes would be almostcertain to pass near the shore laying their ambushes to accomplishthese ends</s>  it was thought very material therefore to conceal themovements even after the lake might be reached though le bourdonhad not a doubt of his canoes much outsailing those of the savages</s> the indians are not very skilful in the use of sails while the beehunter knew how to manage a bark canoe in rough water with unusualskill</s>  in the common acceptation he was no sailor but in his ownpeculiar craft there was not a man living who could excel him indexterity or judgment</s> the haltingplace that morning was not in a swamp for none offeredat a suitable distance from the mouth of the river</s>  on the contraryit was in a piece of opening that was tolerably well garnished withtrees however and through which ran a small brook that poured itstribute into the kalamazoo</s>  the chippewa had taken notice of thisbrook which was large enough to receive the canoes where theymight be concealed in the rushes</s>  a favorable copse surrounded withelders afforded a covered space on shore and these advantages wereimproved for an encampment</s> instead of seeking his rest as usual on reaching this coverpigeonswing left the party on a scout</s>  he walked up the brook somedistance in order to conceal his trail and then struck across theopening taking the direction westward or toward the rivers mouth</s> as for le bourdon and his friends they ate and slept as usualundisturbed but arose some hours before the close of day</s> thus far a great work had been accomplished</s>  the canoes haddescended the stream with a success that was only equalled by thehardihood of the measure conducted by an intelligence that reallyseemed to amount to an instinct pigeonswing carried a map of thekalamazoo in his head and seemed never at a loss to know where

serpent when he deluded eve into disobedience thatnow tempted margery to go beyond the limits which pigeonswing hadset for her with a view to explore and ascertain what might befound without</s>  in doing this however she did not neglect a certaindegree of caution and avoided exposing her person as much aspossible</s> margery had got to the very verge of prudence so far as the coverwas concerned

was certain it could not be pigeonswing who had gonein a contrary direction while the frame of this savage was muchlarger and heavier than that of the chippewa</s>  his rifle leanedagainst the rock

margery then slowly repeated to peter the words of the lordsprayer</s>  she gave him its history and explained the meaning ofseveral of its words that might otherwise have been unintelligibleto him notwithstanding his tolerable proficiency in englishaproficiency that had greatly increased in the last few weeks inconsequence of his constant communications with those who spoke ithabitually</s>  the word trespasses in particular was somewhatdifficult for the indian to comprehend but margery persevered untilshe succeeded in giving her scholar tolerably accurate ideas of themeaning of each term</s>  then she told the indian to kneel with herand for the first time in his life that man of the openings andprairies lifted his voice in prayer to the one god</s>  it is true thatpeter had often before mentally asked favors of his manitou but therequests were altogether of a worldly character and the beingaddressed was invested with attributes very different from thosewhich he now understood to belong to the lord of heaven and earth</s> nor was the spirit in asking at all the same</s>  we do not wish to beunderstood as saying that this indian was already a full convert tochristianity which contains many doctrines of which he had not themost distant idea but his heart had undergone the first step in thegreat change of conversion and he was now as humble as he had oncebeen proud as meek as he had formerly been fierce and he feltthat certain proof of an incipient love of the creator in a similarfeeling toward all the works of his hands</s> when peter arose from his knees after repeating the prayer tomargerys slow leading it was with the dependence of a child on theteaching of its mother</s>  physically he was the man he ever had been</s> he was as able to endure fatigue as sinewy in his frame and ascapable of fasting and of sustaining fatigue as in his most warlikedays but morally the change was great indeed</s>  instead of theobstinate confidence in himself and his traditions which had onceso much distinguished this chief there was substituted an humbledistrust of his own judgment that rendered him singularlyindisposed to rely on his personal views in any matter ofconscience and he was truly become a child in all that pertained tohis religious belief</s>  in good hands and under more advantageouscircumstances the moral improvement of peter would have been greatbut situated as he was it could not be said to amount to much morethan a very excellent commencement</s> all this time both peter and margery had been too intent on theirfeelings and employment to take much heed to the precautionsnecessary to their concealment</s>  the sun was setting ere they aroseand then it was that peter made the important discovery that theywere observed by two of the young men of the pottawattamiesscoutskept out by bears meat to look for the fugitives</s> the time was when peter would not have hesitated to use his rifle onthese unwelcome intruders but the better spirit that had come overhim now led him to adopt a very different course</s>  motioning to theyoung men he ordered them to retire while he led margery withinthe cover of the bushes</s>  formerly peter would not have scrupled toresort to deception in order to throw these two young men on awrong scent and get rid of them in that mode but now he had areluctance to deceive and no sooner did they fall back at hisbeckoning than he followed margery to the camp</s>  the latter wasgiving her husband a hurried account of what had just happened aspeter joined them</s> our camp is known</s>

beehunter did not like thenotion of leaving him behind for various reasons</s>  then it was notyet dark and to descend the river by daylight appeared likeadvancing into the jaws of the lion designedly</s>  nor was le bourdonat his ease on the subject of peter</s>  his sudden appearance theinsufficient and far from clear account of margery and theextraordinary course advised served to renew ancient distrusts andto render him reluctant to move</s>  but of one thing there could be nodoubt</s>  their present position must be known for margery had seenthe two strange indians with her own eyes and a search might soonbe expected</s>  under all the circumstances therefore our heroreluctantly complied with margerys reiterated solicitations andthey all got into the canoes</s> i do not like this movement peter said le bourdon as he shovedhis own light craft down the brook previously to entering theriver</s>  i hope it may turn out to be better than it looks and thatyou can keep us

mussgo</s>  bourdon why you cant ask bee now what bess ting for you todo eh</s>  good time now ask bee to tell what he know</s> the beehunter made no reply but his pretty wife raised her handinvoluntarily as if to implore the indian to forbear</s>  peter was alittle bewildered for as yet he did not understand that a beliefin necromancy was not exactly compatible with the notions of thechristian providence</s>  in his ignorance how much was he worse offthan the wisest of our race</s>  will any discreet man who has ever paidclose attention to the power of the somnambule deny that there is amystery about such a person that exceeds all our means ofexplanation</s>  that there are degrees in the extent of this powerthat there are false as well as true somnambulesall who haveattended to the subject must allow but a deriding disbeliever inour own person once we have since seen that which no laws known tous can explain and which we are certain is not the subject ofcollusion as we must have been a party to the fraud ourselves wereany such practised</s>  to deny the evidence of our senses is an act ofgreater weakness than to believe that there are mysteries connectedwith our moral and physical being that human sagacity has not yetbeen able to penetrate and we repudiate the want of manliness thatshrinks from giving its testimony when once convinced through anapprehension of being derided as weaker than those who withholdtheir belief</s>  we know that our own thoughts have been explained andrendered by a somnambule under circumstances that will not admitof any information by means known to us by other principles andwhatever others may think on the subject we are perfectly consciousthat no collusion did or could exist</s>  why then are we to despisethe poor indian because he still fancied le bourdon could holdcommunication with his bees</s>  we happen to be better informed andthere may be beings who are aware of the as yet hidden laws ofanimal magnetismhidden as respects ourselves though known tothemand who fully comprehend various mistakes and misapprehensionsconnected with our impressions on this subject that escape ourmeans of detection</s>  it is not surprising therefore that peter inhis emergency turned to those bees in the hope that they mightprove of assistance or that margery silently rebuked him for theweakness in the manner mentioned</s> although it was still light the sun was near setting when thecanoes glided into the river</s>  fortunately for the fugitives thebanks were densely wooded and the stream of great widtha littlelake in factand there was not much danger of their being seenuntil they got near the mouth nor then even should they once getwithin the cover of the wild rice and of the rushes</s>  there was noretreat however and after paddling some distance in order to getbeyond the observation of any scout who might approach the placewhere they had last been seen the canoes were brought closetogether and suffered to float before a smart breeze so as not toreach the mouth of the stream before the night closed around them</s> everything appeared so tranquil the solitude was so profound andtheir progress so smooth and uninterrupted that a certain amount ofconfidence revived in the breasts of all and even the beehunterhad hopes of eventual escape</s> a conversation now occurred in which peter was questionedconcerning the manner in which he had been occupied during hisabsence an absence that had given le bourdon so much concern</s>  hadthe chief been perfectly explicit he would have confessed thatfully onehalf of his waking thoughts had been occupied in thinkingof the death of the son of god of the missionarys prayer for hisenemies and of the sublime morality connected with such a religion</s> it is true peter did notcould not indeedenter very profoundlyinto the consideration of these subjects nor were his notionseither very clear or orthodox but they were sincere and thefeelings to which they gave birth were devout</s>  peter did not touchon these circumstances however confining his explanations to thepurely material part of his proceedings</s>  he had remained with bearsmeat crowsfeather and the other leading chiefs in order to be atthe fountainhead of information and to interpose his influenceshould the palefaces unhappily fall into the hands of those whowere so industriously looking for them</s>  nothing had occurred to callhis authority out but a strange uncertainty seemed to reign amongthe warriors concerning the manner in which their intended victimseluded their endeavors to overtake them</s>  no trail had beendiscovered scout after scout coming in to report a total want ofsuccess in their investigations inland</s>  this turned the attention ofthe indians still more keenly on the rivers mouth it being certainthat the canoes could not have passed out into the lake previouslyto the arrival of the two or three first parties of their young menwho had been sent so early to watch that particular outlet</s> peter informed le bourdon that his cache had been discoveredopened and rifled of its stores</s>  this was a severe loss to ourhero and one that would have been keenly felt at any other timebut just then he had interests so much more important to protectthat he thought and said little about this mishap</s>  the circumstancewhich gave him the most concern was this peter stated that bearsmeat had directed about a dozen of his young men to keep watch dayand night in canoes near the mouth of the river lying in waitamong the wild rice like so many snakes in the grass</s> the party was so much interested in this conversation that almostinsensibly to themselves they had dropped down to the beginning ofthe rushes and rice and had got rather dangerously near to thecritical point of their passage</s>  as it was still daylight peter nowproposed pushing the canoes in among the plants and there remaininguntil it might be safer to move</s>  this was done accordingly and in aminute or two all three of the little barks were concealed withinthe cover</s> the question now was whether the fugitives had been observed butsuffered to advance as every foot they descended the stream wastaking them nearer to their foes</s>  peter did not conceal hisapprehension on this point since he deemed it improbable that anyreach near the mouth of the kalamazoo was without its lookouts at amoment so interesting</s>  such was indeed the fact as was afterwardascertained but the young men who had seen peter and margery hadgiven the alarm passing the word where the fugitives were to befound and the sentinels along this portion of the stream haddeserted their stations in order to be in at the

termed honor amongothers as well as among savages</s>  he chose therefore to trust tohis own ability to succeed and supposing the fugitives would not beparticularly on their guard at this point had little doubt ofintercepting them here should they succeed in eluding those he hadleft above</s> the beehunter distrusted that island and used extra caution inpassing it</s>  in the first place the two canoes were broughttogether so as to give them in the dark the appearance of onlyone while the four men added so much to the crew as to aid thedeception</s>  in the end it proved that one of bears

as this shortperiod of time has given birth to among ourselves</s>  we had writtenthus far on the evidence of documents sent to us when an occasionoffered to verify the truth of some of our pictures at least bymeans of personal observation</s> quitting our own quiet and secluded abode in the mountains in thepleasant month of june and in this current year of 1848 wedescended into the valley of the mohawk got into the cars and wentflying by rails toward the setting sun</s>  well could we remember thetime when an entire day was required to pass between that point onthe mohawk where we got on the rails and the little village ofutica</s>  on the present occasion we flew over the space in less thanthree hours and dined in a town of some fifteen thousand souls</s> we reached buffalo at the foot of lake erie in about twenty hoursafter we had entered the cars</s>  this journey would have been thelabor of more than a week at the time in which the scene of thistale occurred</s>  now the whole of the beautiful region teeming withits towns and villages and rich with the fruits of a bountifulseason was almost brought into a single landscape by the rapidityof our passage</s> at buffalo we turned aside to visit the cataract</s>  thither too wewent on rails</s>  thirtyeight years had passed away since we had laideyes on this wonderful fall of water</s>  in the intervening time we hadtravelled much and had visited many of the renowned falls of theold world to say nothing of the great number which are to be foundin other parts of our own land</s>  did this visit then producedisappointment</s> did time and advancing years and feelings that had become deadenedby experience contribute to render the view less striking lessgrand in any way less pleasing than we had hoped to find it</s>  so farfrom this all our expectations were much more than realized</s>  in oneparticular touching which we do not remember ever to have seenanything said we were actually astonished at the surpassing gloryof niagara</s>  it was the character of sweetness if we can so expressit that glowed over the entire aspect of the scene</s>  we were lessstruck with the grandeur of this cataract than with its sublimesoftness and gentleness</s>  to water in agitation use had so longaccustomed us perhaps as in some slight degree to lessen thefeeling of awe that is apt to come over the novice in such scenesbut we at once felt ourselves attracted by the surpassing lovelinessof niagara</s>  the gulf below was more imposing than we had expected tosee it but it was italian in hue and softness amid its wildnessand grandeur</s>  not a drop of the water that fell down that precipiceinspired terror for everything appeared to us to be filled withattraction and love</s>  like italy itself notwithstanding so much thatis grand and imposing the character of softness and the witcheryof the gentler properties is the power we should ascribe toniagara in preference to that of its majesty</s>  we think thisfeeling too is more general than is commonly supposed for we findthose who dwell near the cataract playing around it even to thevery verge of its greatest fall with a species of affection as ifthey had the fullest confidence in its rolling waters</s>  thus it isthat we see the little steamer the maid of the mist paddling upquite near to the green sheet of the horseshoe itself and glidingdown in the current of the vortex as it is compelled to quit theeddies and come more in a line with the main course of the stream</s> wires too are suspended across the gulf below and men pass it inbaskets</s>  it is said that one of these inventions is to carry humanbeings over the main fall so that the adventurer may hang suspendedin the air directly above the vortex</s>  in this way do men and evenwomen prove their love for the place all of which we impute to itspervading character of sweetness and attraction</s> at buffalo we embarked in a boat under the english flag which iscalled the canada this shortened our passage to detroit byavoiding all the stops at lateral ports and we had every reason tobe satisfied with our selection</s>  boat commander and the attendancewere such as would have done credit to any portion of the civilizedworld</s>  there were many passengers a motley collection as usualfrom all parts of the country</s> our attention was early drawn to one party by the singular beautyof its females</s>  they seemed to us to be a grandmother in a wellpreserved green old age a daughter but a matron of little lessthan forty and two exceedingly pretty girls of about eighteen andsixteen whom we took to be children of the last</s>  the strong familylikeness between these persons led us early to make thisclassification which we afterward found was correct</s> by occasional remarks i gathered that the girls had been to aneastern boardingschool that particular feature in civilizationnot yet flourishing in the northwestern states</s>  it seemed to us thatwe could trace in the dialect of the several members of this familythe gradations and peculiarities that denote the origin and habitsof individuals</s>  thus the grandmother was not quite as western inher forms of speech as her matronly daughter while thegrandchildren evidently spoke under the influence of boardingschoolcorrection or like girls who had been often lectured on the subjectfirst rate and yes sir and thats a fact were often in themouth of the pleasing mother and even the grandmother used themall though not as often as her daughter while the young peoplelooked a little concerned and surprised whenever they came out ofthe mouth of their frankspeaking mother</s>  that these persons werenot of a very high social class was evident enough even in theirlanguage</s>  there was much occasion to mention new york we found andthey uniformly called it the city</s>  by no accident did either ofthem happen to use the expression that she had been in town asone of us would be apt to say</s>  hes gone to the city or shes inthe city are awkward phrases and tant soit peu vulgar but evenour pretty young boardingschool eleves would use them</s>  we have ahorror of the expression city and are a little fastidiousperhaps touching its use</s> but these little peculiarities were spots on the sun</s>  the entirefamily taken as a whole was really charming and long before thehour for retiring came we had become much interested in them all</s> we found there was a fifth person belonging to this party who didnot make his appearance that night</s>  from the discourse of thesefemales however it was easy to glean the following leading factsthis fifth person was a male he was indisposed and kept his berthand he was quite aged</s>  several nice little dishes were carried fromthe table into his stateroom that evening by one or the other ofthe young sisters and each of the party appeared anxious tocontribute to the invalids comfort</s>  all this sympathy excited ourinterest and we had some curiosity to see this old man long ere itwas time to retire</s>  as for the females no name was mentioned amongthem but that of a mrs</s>  osborne who was once or twice alluded to infull</s>  it was grandma and ma and dolly and sis</s>  we shouldhave liked it better had it been mother and grandmother andthat the sis had been called betsey or molly but we do not wishto be understood as exhibiting these amiable and goodlookingstrangers as models of refinement</s>  ma and sis did well enoughall things considered though mamma would have been better if theywere not sufficiently polished to say mother</s> we had a pleasant night of it and all the passengers appeared nextmorning with smiling faces</s>  it often blows heavily on that lake butlight airs off the land were all the breezes we encountered</s>  we wereamong the first to turn out and on the upper deck forward a placewhere the passengers are fond of collecting as it enables them tolook ahead we found a single individual who immediately drew all ofour attention to himself</s>  it was an aged man with hair already aswhite as snow</s>  still there was that in his gait attitudes and allhis movements which indicated physical vigor not to say theremains at least of great elasticity and sinewy activity</s>  aged ashe was and he must have long since passed his fourscore years hisform was erect as that of a youth</s>  in stature he was of rather morethan middle height and in movements deliberate and dignified</s>  hisdress was quite plain being black and according to the customs ofthe day</s>  the color of his face and hands however as well as thebold outlines of his countenance and the still keen restlessblack eye indicated the indian</s> here then was a civilized red man and it struck us at once thathe was an ancient child of the forest who had been made to feel thetruths of the gospel</s>  one seldom hesitates about addressing anindian and we commenced a discourse with our venerable fellowpassenger with very little circumlocution or ceremony</s> goodmorning sir we observed a charming time we have of iton the lake</s> yesgood time returned my red neighbor speaking short andclipped like an indian but pronouncing his words as if longaccustomed to the language</s> these steamboats are great inventions for the western lakes as arethe railroads for this vast inland

change from oletimethe traditions of your people no doubt give you reason to see andfeel all this</s> the predominant expression of this red mans countenance was that oflove</s>  on everything on every human being toward whom he turned hisstill expressive eyes the looks he gave them would seem to indicateinterest and affection</s>  this expression was so decided and peculiarthat we early remarked it and it drew us closer and closer to theold chief the longer we remained in his company</s>  that expressionhowever slightly changed when we made this allusion to thetraditions of his people and a cloud passed before his countenance</s> this change nevertheless was as transient as it was sudden thebenevolent and gentle look returning almost as soon as it haddisappeared</s>  he seemed anxious to atone for this involuntaryexpression of regrets for the past by making his communications tome as free as they could be</s> my tradition say a great deal was the answer it say some goodsome bad</s> may i ask of what tribe you are</s> the red man turned his eyes on us kindly as if to lessen anythingungracious there might be in his refusal to answer and with anexpression of benevolence that we scarcely remember ever to haveseen equalled</s>  indeed we might say with truth that the love whichshone out of this old mans countenance habitually surpassed thatwhich we can recall as belonging to any other human face</s>  he seemedto be at peace with himself and with all the other children ofadamtribe make no difference he answered</s>  all children of same

grandaghter</s>  but good book all de same let who will read it</s> this then was scalping peter the very man i was travelling intomichigan to see but how wonderfully changed</s>  the spirit of the mosthigh god had been shed freely upon his moral being and in lieu ofthe revengeful and vindictive savage he now lived a subduedbenevolent christian</s>  in every human being he beheld a brother andno longer thought of destroying races in order to secure to his ownpeople the quiet possession of their huntinggrounds</s>  his very soulwas love and no doubt he felt himself strong enough to bless thosewho cursed him and to give up his spirit like the good missionarywhose death had first turned him toward the worship of the one truegod praying for those who took his life</s> the ways of divine providence are past the investigations of humanreason</s>  how often in turning over the pages of history do we findcivilization the arts moral improvement nay christianity itselffollowing the bloody train left by the conquerors car and goodpouring in upon a nation by avenues that at first were teeming onlywith the approaches of seeming evils</s>  in this way there is nowreason to hope that america is about to pay the debt she owes toafrica and in this way will the invasion of the forests andprairies and openings of the red man be made to atone for itselfby carrying with it the blessings of the gospel and a juster viewof the relations which man bears to his creator</s>  possibly mexico mayderive lasting benefits from the hard lesson that she has sorecently been made to endure</s> this then was peter changed into a civilized man and a christian</s> i have found subsequently that glimmerings of the former beingexisted in his character but they showed themselves only at longintervals and under very peculiar circumstances</s>  the study of thesetraits became a subject of great interest with us for we nowtravelled in company the rest of our journey</s>  the elder lady orgrandma was the margery of our tale still handsome spiritedand kind</s>  the younger matron was her daughter and only child andsis another margery and dorothy were her grandchildren</s>  therewas also a son or a grandson rather ben who was on prairie roundwith the general</s>  the general was our old friend le bourdonwho was still as often called general bourdon as general boden</s> this matter of generals at the west is a little overdone as allranks and titles are somewhat apt to be in new countries</s>  it causesone often to smile at the east and no wonder that an eastern habitshould go down in all its glory beneath the setting sun</s>  inafterdays generals will not be quite as plenty as blackberries</s> no sooner did mrs</s>  boden or margery to use her familiar namelearn that we were the very individual to whom the general hadsent the notes relative to his early adventures which had beenprepared by the rev</s>  mr</s>  varse of kalamazoo than she became asfriendly and communicative as we could possibly desire</s> her own life had been prosperous and her marriage happy</s>  herbrother however had fallen back into his old habits and died erethe war of 1812 was ended</s>  dorothy had returned to her friends inmassachusetts and was still living in a comfortable conditionowing to a legacy from an uncle</s>  the beehunter had taken the fieldin that war and had seen some sharp fighting on the banks of theniagara</s>  no sooner was peace made however than he returned to hisbeloved openings where he had remained growing with the countryas it is termed until he was now what is deemed a rich man inmichigan</s>  he has a plenty of land and that which is good arespectable dwelling and is out of debt</s>  he meets his obligationsto an eastern man just as promptly as he meets those contracted athome and regards the united states and not michigan as hiscountry</s>  all these were good traits and we were glad to learn thatthey existed in one who already possessed so much of our esteem</s>  atdetroit we found a fine flourishing town of a healthful and naturalgrowth and with a population that was fast approaching twentythousand</s>  the shores of the beautiful strait on which it stands andwhich by a strange blending of significations and languages ispopularly called the detroit river were alive with men and theirappliances and we scarce know where to turn to find a moreagreeable landscape than that which was presented to us afterpassing the island of bobolo bois blanc near maiden</s> altogether it resembled a miniature picture of constantinoplewithout its eastern peculiarities</s> at detroit commenced our surprise at the rapid progress of westerncivilization</s>  it will be remembered that at the period of our talethe environs of detroit excepted the whole peninsula of michiganlay in a state of nature</s>  nor did the process of settlement commenceactively until about twenty years since but owing to the characterof the country it already possesses many of the better features ofa longinhabited region</s>  there are stumps of course for new fieldsare constantly coming into cultivation but on the whole theappearance is that of a middleaged rather than that of a newregion</s> we left detroit on a railroad rattling away toward the setting sunat a good speed even for that mode of conveyance</s>  it seemed to usthat our route was well garnished with large villages of which wemust have passed through a dozen in the course of a few hoursrailing these are places varying in size from one to threethousand inhabitants</s>  the vegetation certainly surpassed that ofeven west new york the trees alone excepted</s>  the whole country wasa wheatfield and we now began to understand how america could feedthe world</s>  our road lay among the openings much of the way and wefound them undergoing the changes which are incident to the passageof civilized men</s>  as the periodical fires had now ceased for manyyears underbrush was growing in lieu of the natural grass and inso much those groves are less attractive than formerly but oneeasily comprehends the reason and can picture to himself the aspectthat these pleasant woods must have worn in times of old</s> we left the railroad at kalamazooan unusually pretty village onthe banks of the stream of that name</s>  those who laid out this placesome fifteen years since had the taste to preserve most of itstrees and the houses and grounds that stand a little apart from thebusiest streetsand they are numerous for a place of rather morethan two thousand soulsare particularly pleasant to the eye onaccount of the shade and the rural pictures they present</s>  here mrs</s> boden told us we were within a mile or two of the very spot whereonce had stood castle meal chateau au miel though the generalhad finally established himself at schoolcraft on prairie ronde</s> the first prairie we had ever seen was on the road between detroitand kalamazoo distant from the latter place only some eight or ninemiles</s>  the axe had laid the country open in its neighborhood butthe spot was easily to be recognized by the air of cultivation andage that pervaded it</s>  there was not a stump on it and the fieldswere as smooth as any on the plains of lombardy and far morefertile rich as the last are known to be</s>  in a word the beautifulperfection of that little natural meadow became apparent at oncethough seated amid a landscape that was by no means wanting ininterest of its own</s> we passed the night at the village of kalamazoo but the party offemales with old peter proceeded on to prairie round as thatparticular part of the country is called in the dialect of michiganit being a corruption of the old french name of la prairie ronde</s> the round meadow does not sound as well as prairie round and thelast being quite as clear a term as the other though a mixture ofthe two languages we prefer to use it</s>  indeed the word prairiemay now be said to be adopted into the english meaning merely anatural instead of an artificial meadow though one of peculiar andlocal characteristics</s>  we wrote a note to general boden as i foundour old acquaintance ben boden was universally termed letting himknow i should visit schoolcraft next day not wishing to intrude atthe moment when that charming family was just reunited after so longa separation</s> the next day accordingly we got into a buggy and went our way</s> the road was slightly sandy a good part of the twelve miles we hadto travel though it became less so as we drew near to thecelebrated prairie</s>  and celebrated and that by an abler pen thanours does this remarkable place deserve to be</s>  we found all ourexpectations concerning it fully realized and drove through thescene of abundance it presented with an admiration that was notentirely free from awe</s> to get an idea of prairie round the reader must imagine an ovalplain of some fiveandtwenty or thirty thousand acres in extent ofthe most surpassing fertility without an eminence of any sortalmost without an inequality</s>  there are a few small cavitieshowevers in which there are springs that form large pools of waterthat the cattle will drink</s>  this plain so far as we saw it is nowentirely fenced and cultivated</s>  the fields are large manycontaining eighty acres and some one hundred and sixty most ofthem being in wheat</s>  we saw several of this size in that grain</s> farmhouses dotted the surface with barns and the otheraccessories of rural life</s>  in the centre of the prairie is anisland of forest containing some five or six hundred acres of thenoblest native trees we remember ever to have seen</s>  in the centre ofthis wood is a little lake circular in shape and exceeding aquarter of a mile in diameter</s>  the walk in this woodwhich is not anopening but an oldfashioned virgin forestwe found delightful ofa warm summers day</s>  one thing that we saw in it was characteristicof the country</s>  some of the nearest farmers had drawn their manureinto it where it lay in large piles in order to get it out of theway of doing any mischief</s>  its effect on the land it was thoughtwould be to bring too much straw</s> on one side of this island of wood lies the little village or largehamlet of schoolcraft</s>  here we were most cordially welcomed bygeneral boden and all of his fine descendants</s>  the head of thisfamily is approaching seventy but is still hale and hearty</s>  hishead is as white as snow and his face as red as a cherry</s>  a finerold man one seldom sees</s>  temperance activity the open air and agood conscience have left him a noble ruin if ruin he can yet becalled</s>  he owes the last blessing as he told us himself to thefact that he kept clear of the whirlwind of speculation that passedover this region some ten or fifteen years since</s>  his means areample and the harvest being about to commence he invited me to thefield</s> the peculiar ingenuity of the american has supplied the want oflaborers in a country where agriculture is carried on by wholesaleespecially in the cereals by an instrument of the most singular andelaborate construction</s>  this machine is drawn by sixteen or eighteenhorses attached to it laterally so as to work clear of thestanding grain and who move the whole fabric on a moderate butsteady walk</s>  a path is first cut with the cradle on one side of thefield when the machine is dragged into the open place</s>  here itenters the standing grain cutting off its heads with the utmostaccuracy as it moves</s>  forks beneath prepare the way and a rapidvibratory motion of a great number of twoedged knives effect theobject</s>  the stalks of the grain can be cut as low or as high as onepleases but it is usually thought best to take only the heads</s> afterward the standing straw is burned or fed off upright</s> the impelling power which causes the great fabric to advance alsosets in motion the machinery within it as soon as the heads of thegrain are severed from the stalks they pass into a receptaclewhere by a very quick and simple process the kernels are separatedfrom the husks</s>  thence all goes into a fanning machine where thechaff is blown away</s>  the clean grain falls into a small bin whenceit is raised by a screw elevator to a height that enables it to passout at an opening to which a bag is attached</s>  wagons follow the slowmarch of the machine and the proper number of men are inattendance</s>  bag after bag is renewed until a wagon is loaded whenit at once proceeds to the mill where the grain is soon convertedinto flour</s>  generally the husbandman sells to the miller butoccasionally he pays for making the flour and sends the latter offby railroad to detroit whence it finds its way to europepossibly to help feed the millions of the old world</s>  such atleast was the course of trade the past season</s>  as respects thisingenious machine it remains only to say that it harvests cleansand bags from twenty to thirty acres of heavy wheat in the courseof a single summers day</s>  altogether it is a gigantic inventionwell adapted to meet the necessities of a gigantic country</s> old peter went afield with us that day</s>  there he stood like astriking monument of a past that was still so recent and wonderful</s> on that very prairie which was now teeming with the appliances ofcivilization he had hunted and held his savage councils</s>  on thatprairie had he meditated or consented to the deaths

vestments of thewhites</s>  the attire of this sinewy old man was a mixture of that ofthe two races</s>  he wore a huntingshirt moccasins and a belt buthe also wore trousers and otherwise had brought himself within thehabits of conventional decency</s>  it was pigeonswing the chippewacome to pay his annual visit to his friend the beehunter themeeting was cordial and we afterward ascertained that when the oldman departed he went away loaded with gifts that would render himcomfortable for a twelvemonth</s> but peter after all was the great centre of interest with us</s>  wecould admire the
