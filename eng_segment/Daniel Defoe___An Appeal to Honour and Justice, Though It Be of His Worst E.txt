 whatjustice i met with and above all what mercy is too well known toneed repetition</s> this introduction is made that it may bring me to what has been thefoundation of all my further concern in public affairs and will producea sufficient reason for my adhering to those whose obligations upon mewere too strong to be resisted even when many things were done by themwhich i could not approve and for this reason it is that i think itnecessary to distinguish how far i did or did not adhere to or join inor with the persons or conduct of the late government and those whoare willing to judge with impartiality and charity will see reason touse me the more tenderly in their thoughts when they weigh theparticulars</s> i will make no reflections upon the treatment i met with from the peoplei suffered for or how i was abandoned even in my sufferings at thesame time that they acknowledged the service i had been to their causebut i must mention it to let you know that while i lay friendless anddistressed in the prison of newgate my family ruined and myselfwithout hope of deliverance a message was brought me from a person ofhonour who till that time i had never had the least acquaintancewith or knowledge of other than by fame or by sight as we know menof quality by seeing them on public occasions</s>  i gave no present answerto the person who brought it having not duly weighed the import of themessage</s>  the message was by word of mouth thuspray ask thatgentleman what i can do for him</s>  but in return to this kind andgenerous message i immediately took my pen and ink and wrote the storyof the blind man in the gospel who followed our saviour and to whomour blessed lord put the question what wilt thou that i should do untothee</s>  who as if he had made it strange that such a question should beasked or as if he had said that i am blind and yet ask me what thoushalt do for me</s>  my answer is plain in my misery lord that i mayreceive my sight</s> i needed not to make the application</s>  and from this time although i layfour months in prison after this and heard no more of it yet from thistime as i learned afterwards this noble person made it his business tohave my case represented to her majesty and methods taken for mydeliverance</s> i mention this part because i am no more to forget the obligation uponme to the queen than to my first benefactor</s> when her majesty came to have the truth of the case laid before her isoon felt the effects of her royal goodness and compassion</s>  and firsther majesty declared that she left all that matter to a certain personand did not think he would have used me in such a manner</s>  probably thesewords may seem imaginary to some and the speaking them to be of novalue and so they would have been had they not been followed withfurther and more convincing proofs of what they imported which werethese that her majesty was pleased particularly to inquire into mycircumstances and family and by my lord treasurer godolphin to send aconsiderable supply to my wife and family and to send to me the prisonmoney to pay my fine and the expenses of my discharge</s>  whether this bea just foundation let my enemies judge</s>
gratitude and fidelity are inseparable from an honest man</s>  but to bethus obliged by a stranger by a man of quality and honour and afterthat by the sovereign under whose administration i was suffering letany one put himself in my stead and examine upon what principles icould ever act against either such a queen or such a benefactor andwhat must my own heart reproach me with what blushes must have coveredmy face when i had looked in and called myself ungrateful to him thatsaved me thus from distress or her that fetched me out of the dungeonand gave my family relief</s>  let any man who knows what principles arewhat engagements of honour and gratitude are make his case his own andsay what i could have done more or less than i have done</s> i must go on a little with the detail of the obligation and then ishall descend to relate what i have done and what i have not done inthe case</s> being delivered from the distress i was in her majesty who was notsatisfied to do me good by a single act of her bounty had the goodnessto think of taking me into her service and i had the honour to beemployed in several honourable though secret services by theinterposition of my first benefactor who then appeared as a member inthe public administration</s> i had the happiness to discharge myself in all these trusts so much tothe satisfaction of those who employed me though oftentimes withdifficulty and danger that my lord treasurer godolphin whose memory ihave always honoured was pleased to continue his favour to me and todo me all good offices with her majesty even after an unhappy breachhad separated him from my first benefactor the particulars of which maynot be improper to relate and as it is not an injustice to any so ihope it will not be offensive</s> when upon that fatal breach the secretary of state was dismissed fromthe service i looked upon myself as lost it being a general rule insuch cases when a great officer falls that all who came in by hisinterest fall with him and resolving never to abandon the fortunes ofthe man to whom i owed so much of my own i quitted the usualapplications which i had made to my lord treasurer</s> but my generous benefactor when he understood it frankly told me thati should by no means do so for said he in the most engaging termsmy lord treasurer will employ you in nothing but what is for the publicservice and agreeably to your own sentiments of things and besides itis the queen you are serving who has been very good to you</s>  pray applyyourself as you used to do i shall not take it ill from you in theleast</s> upon this i went to wait on my lordtreasurer who received me withgreat freedom and told me smiling he had not seen me a long while</s>  itold his lordship very frankly the occasionthat the unhappy breachthat had fallen out made me doubtful whether i should be acceptable tohis lordship</s>  that i knew it was usual when great persons fall that allwho were in their interest fell with them</s>  that his lordship knew theobligations i was under and that i could not but fear my interest inhis lordship was lessened on that account</s>  not at all mr</s>
upon this i attended his lordship as usual and being resolved toremove all possible ground of suspicion that i kept any secretcorrespondence i never visited or wrote to or any way correspondedwith my principal benefactor for above three years which he so wellknew the reason of and so well approved that punctual behaviour in methat he never took it ill from me at all</s> in consequence of this reception my lord godolphin had the goodness notonly to introduce me for the second time to her majesty and to thehonour of kissing her hand but obtained for me the continuance of anappointment which her majesty had been pleased to make me inconsideration of a formal special service i had done and in which i hadrun as much risk of my life as a grenadier upon the counterscarp andwhich appointment however was first obtained for me at theintercession of my said first benefactor and is all owing to thatintercession and her majestys bounty</s>  upon this second introductionher majesty was pleased to tell me with a goodness peculiar to herselfthat she had such satisfaction in my former services that she hadappointed me for another affair which was something nice and that mylord treasurer should tell me the rest and so i withdrew</s> the next day his lordship having commanded me to attend told me thathe must send me to scotland and gave me but three days to preparemyself</s>  accordingly i went to scotland where neither my business northe manner of my discharging it is material to this tract nor will itbe ever any part of my character that i reveal what should be concealed</s> and yet my errand was such as was far from being unfit for a sovereignto direct or an honest man to perform and the service i did upon thatoccasion as it is not unknown to the greatest man now in the nationunder the king and the prince so i dare say his grace was neverdispleased with the part i had in it and i hope will not forget it</s> these things i mention upon this account and no other viz</s>  to statethe obligation i have been in all along to her majesty personally andto my first benefactor principally by which i say i think i was atleast obliged not to act against them even in those things which imight not approve</s>  whether i have acted with them further than i oughtshall be spoken of by itself</s> having said thus much of the obligations laid on me and the persons bywhom i have this only to add that i think no man will say a subjectcould be under greater bonds to his prince or a private person to aminister of state and i shall ever preserve this principle that anhonest man cannot be ungrateful to his benefactor</s> but let no man run away now with the notion that i am now intending toplead the obligation that was laid upon me from her majesty or from anyother person to justify my doing anything that is not otherwise to bejustified in itself</s> nothing would be more injurious than such a construction and thereforei capitulate for so much justice as to explain myself by thisdeclaration viz</s>  that i only speak of those obligations as binding meto a negative conduct not to fly in the face of or concern myself indisputes with those to whom i was under such obligations although imight not in my judgment join in many things that were done</s>  noobligation could excuse me in calling evil good or good evil but i amof the opinion that i might justly think myself obliged to defend whati thought was to be defended and to be silent in anything which i mightthink was not</s> if this is a crime i must plead guilty and give in the history of myobligation above mentioned as an extenuation at least if not ajustification of my conduct</s> suppose a mans father was guilty of several things unlawful andunjustifiable a man may heartily detest the unjustifiable thing andyet it ought not to be expected that he should expose his father</s>  ithink the case on my side exactly the same nor can the duty to a parentbe more strongly obliging than the obligation laid on me but i mustallow the case on the other side not the same</s> and this brings me to the affirmative and inquire what the matters offact are what i have done or have not done on account of theseobligations which i am under</s> it is a general suggestion and is affirmed with such assurance thatthey tell me it is in vain to contradict it that i have been employedby the earl of oxford late lord treasurer in the late disputes aboutpublic affairs to write for him or to put it into their ownparticulars have written by his directions taken the materials fromhim been dictated to or instructed by him or by other persons fromhim by his order and the like and that i have received a pension orsalary or payment from his lordship for such services as these</s>  it wasimpossible since these things have been so confidently affirmed butthat if i could put it into words that would more fully express themeaning of these people i profess i would do it</s>  one would think thatsome evidence might be produced some facts might appear some one orother might be found that could speak of certain knowledge</s>  to saythings have been carried too closely to be discovered is sayingnothing for then they must own that it is not discovered and how thencan they affirm it as they do with such an assurance as nothing oughtto be affirmed by honest men unless they were able to prove it</s> to speak then to the fact</s>  were the reproach upon me only in thisparticular i should not mention it</s>  i should not think it a reproach tobe directed by a man to whom the queen had at that time entrusted theadministration of the government</s>  but as it is a reproach upon hislordship justice requires that i do right in this case</s>  the thing istrue or false</s>  i would recommend it to those who would be called honestmen to consider but one thing viz</s>  what if it should not be true</s>  canthey justify the injury done to that person or to any person concerned</s> if it cannot be proved if no vestiges appear to ground it upon how canthey charge men upon rumours and reports and join to run down menscharacters by the stream of clamour</s>
in answer to the charge i bear witness to posterity that every part ofit is false and forged</s>  and i do solemnly protest in the fear andpresence of him that shall judge us all both the slanderers and theslandered that i have not received any instructions directionsorders or let them call it what they will of that kind for thewriting of any part of what i have written or any materials for theputting together for the forming any book or pamphlet whatsoever fromthe said earl of oxford late lord treasurer or from any person by hisorder or direction since the time that the late earl of godolphin waslord treasurer</s>  neither did i ever show or cause to be shown to hislordship for his approbation correction alteration or for any othercause any book paper or pamphlet which i have written and publishedbefore the same was worked off at the press and published</s> if any man living can detect me of the least prevarication in this orin any part of it i desire him to do it by all means and i challengeall the world to do it</s>  and if they cannot then i appeal as in mytitle to the honour and justice of my worst enemies to know upon whatfoundation of truth or conscience they can affirm these things and forwhat it is that i bear these reproaches</s> in all my writing i ever capitulated for my liberty to speak accordingto my own judgment of things i ever had that liberty allowed me norwas i ever imposed upon to write this way or that against my judgment byany person whatsoever</s> i come now historically to the point of time when my lord godolphin wasdismissed from his employment and the late unhappy division broke outat court</s>  i waited on my lord the day he was displaced and humbly askedhis lordships direction what course i should take</s>  his lordshipsanswer was that he had the same goodwill to assist me but not thesame power that i was the queens servant and that all he had done forme was by her majestys special and particular direction and thatwhoever should succeed him it was not material to me he supposed ishould be employed in nothing relating to the present differences</s>  mybusiness was to wait till i saw things settled and then apply myself tothe ministers of state to receive her majestys commands from them</s> it occurred to me immediately as a principle for my conduct that itwas not material to me what ministers her majesty was pleased to employmy duty was to go along with every ministry so far as they did notbreak in upon the constitution and the laws and liberties of mycountry my part being only the duty of a subject viz</s>  to submit toall lawful commands and to enter into no service which was notjustifiable by the laws to all which i have exactly obliged myself</s> by this i was providentially cast back upon my original benefactorwho according to his wonted goodness was pleased to lay my case beforeher majesty and thereby i preserved my interest in her majestysfavour but without any engagement of service</s> as for consideration pension gratification or reward i declare toall the world i have had none except only that old appointment whichher majesty was pleased to make me in the days of the ministry of mylord godolphin of which i have spoken already and which was forservices done in a foreign country some years before</s>  neither have ibeen employed directed or ordered by my lord treasurer aforesaid todo or not to do anything in the affairs of the unhappy differenceswhich have so long perplexed us and for which i have so many and suchunjust reproaches</s> i come next to enter into the matters of fact and what it is i havedone or not done which may justify the treatment i have met with andfirst for the negative part what i have not done</s> the first thing in the unhappy breaches which have fallen out is theheaping up scandal upon the persons and conduct of men of honour on oneside as well as the other those unworthy methods of falling upon oneanother by personal calumny and reproach</s>  this i have often in printcomplained of as an unchristian ungenerous and unjustifiable practice</s> not a word can be found in all i have written reflecting on the personsor conduct of any of the former ministry</s>  i served her majesty undertheir administration they acted honourably and justly in everytransaction in which i had the honour to be concerned with them and inever published or said anything dishonourable of any of them in mylife nor can the worst enemy i have produce any such thing against me</s> i always regretted the change and looked upon it as a great disaster tothe nation in general i am sure it was so to me in particular and thedivisions and feuds among parties which followed that change weredoubtless a disaster to us all</s> the next thing that followed the change was the peace no man can saythat ever i once said in my life that i approved of the peace</s>  i wrote apublic paper at that time and there it remains upon record against me</s> i printed it openly and that so plainly as others durst not do that idid not like the peace neither that which was made nor that which wasbefore making that i thought the protestant interest was not taken careof in either and that the peace i was for was such as should neitherhave given the spanish monarchy to the house of bourbon nor to the houseof austria but that this bone of contention should have been broken topieces that it might not be dangerous to europe and that theprotestant powers viz</s>  britain and the states should have sostrengthened and fortified their interest by their sharing the commerceand strength of spain as should have made them no more afraid of franceor the emperor so that the protestant interest should have beensuperior to all the powers of europe and been in no more danger ofexorbitant powers whether french or austrian</s>  this was the peace ialways argued for pursuant to the design of king william in the treatyof partition and pursuant to that article of the grand alliance whichwas directed by the same glorious hand at the beginning of this lastwar viz</s>  that all we should conquer in the spanish west indies shouldbe our own</s> this was the true design that england and holland should have turnedtheir naval power which was eminently superior to that of france tothe conquest of the spanish west indies by which the channel of tradeand return of bullion which now enriches the enemies of both had beenours and as the wealth so the strength of the world had been inprotestant hands</s>  spain whoever had it must then have been dependentupon us</s>  the house of bourbon would have found it so poor without us asto be scarce worth fighting for and the people so averse to them forwant of their commerce as not to make it ever likely that france couldkeep it</s> this was the foundation i ever acted upon with relation to the peace</s>  itis true that when it was made and could not be otherwise i thoughtour business was to make the best of it and rather to inquire whatimprovements were to be made of it than to be continually exclaiming atthose who made it and where the objection lies against this part icannot yet see</s> while i spoke of things in this manner i bore infinite reproaches fromclamouring pens of being in the french interest being hired and bribedto defend a bad peace and the like and most of this was upon asupposition of my writing or being the author of abundance ofpamphlets which came out every day and which i had no hand in</s>

thechurch and the dissenters and pull our skins off by fire and fagot</s> the next difference i had with good men was about the scandalouspractice of occasional conformity in which i had the misfortune to makemany honest men angry rather because i had the better of the argumentthan because they disliked what i said</s> and now i have lived to see the dissenters themselves very quiet if notvery well pleased with an act of parliament to prevent it</s>  their friendsindeed laid it on they would be friends indeed if they would talk oftaking it off again</s> again i had a breach with honest men for their maltreating kingwilliam of which i say nothing because i think they are now openingtheir eyes and making what amends they can to his memory</s> the fifth difference i had with them was about the treaty of partitionin which many honest men are mistaken and in which i told them plainlythen that they would at last end the war upon worse terms and so it ismy opinion they would have done though the treaty of gertrudenburghhad taken place</s> the sixth time i differed with them was when the old whigs fell upon themodern whigs and when the duke of marlborough and my lord godolphinwere used by the observator in a manner worse i must confess for thetime it lasted than ever they were used since nay though it were byabel and the examiner but the success failed</s>  in this dispute my lordgodolphin did me the honour to tell me i had served him and his gracealso both faithfully and successfully</s>  but his lordship is dead and ihave now no testimony of it but what is to be found in the observatorwhere i am plentifully abused for being an enemy to my country byacting in the interest of my lord godolphin and the duke of marlborough</s> what weathercock can turn with such tempers as these</s> i am now on the seventh breach with them and my crime now is that iwill not believe and say the same things of the queen and the latetreasurer which i could not believe before of my lord godolphin and theduke of marlborough and which in truth i cannot believe and thereforecould not say it of either of them and which if i had believed yet iought not to have been the man that should have said it for the reasonsaforesaid</s> in such turns of tempers and times a man must be tenfold a vicar ofbray or it is impossible but he must one time or other be out witheverybody</s>  this is my present condition and for this i am reviled withhaving abandoned my principles turned jacobite and what not</s>  god judgebetween me and these men</s>  would they come to any particulars with mewhat real guilt i may have i would freely acknowledge and if they wouldproduce any evidence of the bribes the pensions and the rewards ihave taken i would declare honestly whether they were true or no</s>  ifthey would give a list of the books which they charge me with and thereasons why they lay them at my door i would acknowledge my mistakeown what i have done and let them know what i have not done</s>  but thesemen neither show mercy nor leave place for repentance in which theyact not only unlike their master but contrary to his express commands</s> it is true good men have been used thus in former times and all thecomfort i have is that these men have not the last judgment in theirhands if they had dreadful would be the case of those who oppose them</s> but that day will show many men and things also in a different statefrom what they may now appear in</s>  some that now appear clear and fairwill then be seen to be black and foul and some that are now thoughtblack and foul will then be approved and accepted and thither icheerfully appeal concluding this part in the words of the prophet iheard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and wewill report it all my familiars watched for my halting sayingperadventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him andwe shall take our revenge on him</s>
