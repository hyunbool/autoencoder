what of coming woe and alli presaged came to pass</s> in order to know just what came to pass i must give you a view of thehouse and home into which this carpet was introduced</s> my wife and i were somewhat advanced housekeepers and our dwellingwas first furnished by her father in the oldfashioned jogtrot dayswhen furniture was made with a view to its lasting from generation togeneration</s>  everything was strong and comfortableheavy mahoganyguiltless of the modern device of veneering and hewed out with asquare solidity which had not an idea of change</s>  it was so to speaka sort of granite foundation of the household structure</s>  then wecommenced housekeeping with the full idea that our house was a thingto be lived in and that furniture was made to be used</s>  that mostsensible of women mrs</s>  crowfield agreed fully with me that in ourhouse there was to be nothing too good for ourselvesno room shut upin holiday attire to be enjoyed by strangers for three or four days inthe year while we lived in holes and corners no best parlor fromwhich we were to be excluded no silver plate to be kept in the safein the bank and brought home only in case of a grand festival whileour daily meals were served with dingy britannia</s>  strike a broadplain average i said to my wife have everything abundantserviceable and give all our friends exactly what we have ourselvesno better and no worse and my wife smiled approval on my sentiment</s> smile</s>  she did more than smile</s>  my wife resembles one of those convexmirrors i have sometimes seen</s>  every idea i threw out plain andsimple she reflected back upon me in a thousand little glitters andtwinkles of her own she made my crude conceptions come back to me insuch perfectly dazzling performances that i hardly recognized them</s>  mymind warms up when i think what a home that woman made of our housefrom the very first day she moved into it</s>  the great large airyparlor with its ample bowwindow when she had arranged it seemed aperfect trap to catch sunbeams</s>  there was none of that discouragingtrimness and newness that often repel a mans bachelor friends afterthe first call and make them feel oh well one cannot go in atcrowfields now unless one is dressed one might put them out</s>  thefirst thing our parlor said to any one was that we were not people tobe put out that we were widespread easygoing and jolly folk</s>  evenif tom brown brought in ponto and his shootingbag there was nothingin that parlor to strike terror into man and dog for it was writtenon the face of things that everybody there was to do just as he or shepleased</s>  there were my books and my writingtable spread out with allits miscellaneous confusion of papers on one side of the fireplaceand there were my wifes great ample sofa and worktable on theother there i wrote my articles for the north american and thereshe turned and ripped and altered her dresses and there lay crochetand knitting and embroidery side by side with a weekly basket offamily mending and in neighborly contiguity with the last book of theseason which my wife turned over as she took her afterdinner loungeon the sofa</s>  and in the bowwindow were canaries always singing and agreat stand of plants always fresh and blooming and ivy which grewand clambered and twined about the pictures</s>  best of all there was inour parlor that household altar the blazing wood fire whosewholesome hearty crackle is the truest household inspiration</s>  i quiteagree with one celebrated american author who holds that an openfireplace is an altar of patriotism</s>  would our revolutionary fathershave gone barefooted and bleeding over snows to defend airtightstoves and cookingranges</s>  i trow not</s>  it was the memory of the greatopen kitchenfire with its back log and fore stick of cordwood itsroaring hilarious voice of invitation its dancing tongues of flamethat called to them through the snows of that dreadful winter to keepup their courage that made their hearts warm and bright with athousand reflected memories</s>  our neighbors said that it was delightfulto sit by our firebut then for their part they could not affordit wood was so ruinously dear and all that</s>  most of these peoplecould not for the simple reason that they felt compelled in order tomaintain the family dignity to keep up a parlor with great pomp andcircumstance of upholstery where they sat only on dress occasionsand of course the wood fire was out of the question</s> when children began to make their appearance in our establishment mywife like a wellconducted housekeeper had the best of nurseryarrangementsa room all warmed lighted and ventilated andabounding in every proper resource of amusement to the rising racebut it was astonishing to see how notwithstanding this thecentripetal attraction drew every pair of little pattering feet to ourparlor</s> my dear why dont you take your blocks upstairs</s> i want to be where oo are said with a piteous under lip wasgenerally a most convincing answer</s> then the small people could not be disabused of the idea that certainchief treasures of their own would be safer under papas writingtableor mammas sofa than in the safest closet of their domains</s>  mywritingtable was dockyard for arthurs new ship and stable forlittle toms pepperandsaltcolored pony and carriagehouse forcharleys new wagon while whole armies of paper dolls kept house inthe recess behind mammas sofa</s> and then in due time came the tribe of pets who followed the littleones and rejoiced in the blaze of the firelight</s>  the boys had asplendid newfoundland which knowing our weakness we warned themwith awful gravity was never to be a parlor dog but somehow whatwith little beggings and pleadings on the part of arthur and tom andthe piteous melancholy with which rover would look through thewindowpanes when shut out from the blazing warmth into the dark coldveranda it at last came to pass that rover gained a regular corner atthe hearth a regular status in every family convocation</s>  and thencame a little blackandtan english terrier for the girls and then afleecy poodle who established himself on the corner of my wifessofa and for each of these some little voice pleaded and somelittle heart would be so near broken at any slight that my wife and iresigned ourselves to live in a menagerie the more so as we wereobliged to confess a lurking weakness towards these fourfootedchildren ourselves</s> so we grew and flourished togetherchildren dogs birds flowersand all and although my wife often in paroxysms of housewifelinessto which the best of women are subject would declare that we neverwere fit to be seen yet i comforted her with the reflection thatthere were few people whose friends seemed to consider them betterworth seeing judging by the stream of visitors and loungers which wasalways setting towards our parlor</s>  people seemed to find it good to bethere they said it was somehow homelike and pleasant and that therewas a kind of charm about it that made it easy to talk and easy tolive and as my girls and boys grew up there seemed always to be somemerry doing or other going on there</s>  arty and tom brought home theircollege friends who straightway took root there and seemed to fancythemselves a part of us</s>  we had no receptionrooms apart where thegirls were to receive young gentlemen all the courting and flirtingthat were to be done had for their arena the ample variety of surfacepresented by our parlor which with sofas and screens and lounges andrecesses and writing and work tables disposed here and there andthe genuine laisser aller of the whole mnage seemed on the wholeto have offered ample advantages enough for at the time i write oftwo daughters were already established in marriage while my youngestwas busy as yet in performing that little domestic ballet of the catwith the mouse in the case of a most submissive youth of theneighborhood</s> all this time our parlor furniture though of that granitic formationi have indicated began to show marks of that decay to which thingssublunary are liable</s>  i cannot say that i dislike this look in a room</s> take a fine ample hospitable apartment where all things freelyand generously used softly and indefinably grow old together thereis a sort of mellow tone and keeping which pleases my eye</s>  what if theseams of the great inviting armchair where so many friends have satand lounged do grow white</s>  what in fact if some easy couch has anundeniable hole worn in its friendly cover</s>  i regard with tendernesseven these mortal weaknesses of these servants and witnesses of ourgood times and social fellowship</s>  no vulgar touch wore them they maybe called rather the marks and indentations which the glittering inand out of the tide of social happiness has worn in the rocks of ourstrand</s>  i would no more disturb the gradual toningdown and aging of awellused set of furniture by smart improvements than i would have amodern dauber paint in emendations in a fine old picture</s> so we men reason but women do not always think as we do</s>  there isa virulent demon of housekeeping not wholly cast out in the best ofthem and which often breaks out in unguarded moments</s>  in fact missmarianne being on the lookout for furniture wherewith to begin anew establishment and jenny who had accompanied her in herperegrinations had more than once thrown out little disparagingremarks on the timeworn appearance of our establishment suggestingcomparison with those of more modern furnished rooms</s> it is positively scandalous the way our furniture looks i one dayheard one of them declaring to her mother and this old rag of acarpet</s> my feelings were hurt not the less so that i knew that the largecloth which covered the middle of the floor and which the women calla bocking had been bought and nailed down there after a solemnfamily council as the best means of concealing the too evident darnswhich years of good cheer had made needful in our stanch oldhousehold friend the threeply carpet made in those days when to bea threeply was a pledge of continuance and service</s> well it was a joyous and bustling day when after one of thosedomestic whirlwinds which the women are fond of denominatinghousecleaning the new brussels carpet was at length brought in andnailed down and its beauty praised from mouth to mouth</s>  our oldfriends called in and admired and all seemed to be well except thati had that light and delicate presage of changes to come whichindefinitely brooded over me</s> the first premonitory symptom was the look of apprehensive suspicionwith which the female senate regarded the genial sunbeams that hadalways glorified our bowwindow</s> this house ought to have inside blinds said marianne with all theconfident decision of youth this carpet will be ruined if that sunis allowed to come in like that</s> and that dirty little canary must really be hung in the kitchensaid jenny he always did make such a litter scattering his seedchippings about and he never takes his bath without flirting out somewater</s>  and mamma it appears to me it will never do to have theplants here</s>  plants are always either leaking through the pots uponthe carpet or scattering bits of blossoms and dead leaves or someaccident upsets or breaks a pot</s>  it was no matter you know when wehad the old carpet but this we really want to have kept nice</s> mamma stood her ground for the plantsdarlings of her heart for manya yearbut temporized and showed that disposition towardscompromise which is most inviting to aggression</s> i confess i trembled for of all radicals on earth none are to becompared to females that have once in hand a course of domesticinnovation and reform</s>  the sacred fire the divine furor burns intheir bosoms they become perfect pythonesses and every chair theysit on assumes the magic properties of the tripod</s>  hence the dismaythat lodges in the bosoms of us males at the fateful spring and autumnseasons denominated housecleaning</s>  who can say whither the awfulgods the prophetic fates may drive our fair household divinitieswhat sins of ours may be brought to light what indulgences andcompliances which uninspired woman has granted in her ordinary mortalhours may be torn from us</s>  he who has been allowed to keep a pair ofpet slippers in a concealed corner and by the fireside indulged witha chair which he might ad libitum fill with all sorts of pamphletsand miscellaneous literature suddenly finds himself reformed out ofknowledge his pamphlets tucked away into pigeonholes and corners andhis slippers put in their place in the hall with perhaps a briskinsinuation about the shocking dust and disorder that men willtolerate</s> the fact was that the very first night after the advent of the newcarpet i had a prophetic dream</s>  among our treasures of art was alittle etching by an english artist friend the subject of which wasthe gambols of the household fairies in a baronial library after thehousehold were in bed</s>  the little people are represented in everyattitude of frolic enjoyment</s>  some escalade the great armchair andlook down from its top as from a domestic mont blanc some climb aboutthe bellows some scale the shaft of the shovel while some formingin magic ring dance festively on the yet glowing hearth</s>  tiny troopspromenade the writingtable</s>  one perches himself quaintly on the topof the inkstand and holds colloquy with another who sits crossleggedon a paper weight while a companion looks down on them from the topof the sandbox</s>  it was an ingenious little device and gave me theidea which i often expressed to my wife that much of the peculiarfeeling of security composure and enjoyment which seems to be theatmosphere of some rooms and houses came from the unsuspected presenceof these little people the household fairies so that the belief intheir existence became a solemn article of faith with me</s> accordingly that evening after the installation of the carpet whenmy wife and daughters had gone to bed as i sat with my slippered feetbefore the last coals of the fire i fell asleep in my chair and lo</s> my own parlor presented to my eye a scene of busy life</s>  the littlepeople in green were tripping to and fro but in great confusion</s> evidently something was wrong among them for they were fussing andchattering with each other as if preparatory to a general movement</s> in the region of the bowwindow i observed a tribe of them standingwith tiny valises and carpetbags in their hands as though about todepart on a journey</s>  on my writingtable another set stood around myinkstand and penrack who pointing to those on the floor seemed todebate some question among themselves while others of them appearedto be collecting and packing away in tiny trunks certain fairytreasures preparatory to a general departure</s>  when i looked at thesocial hearth at my wifes sofa and workbasket i saw similarappearances of dissatisfaction and confusion</s>  it was evident that thehousehold fairies were discussing the question of a general andsimultaneous removal</s>  i groaned in spirit and stretching out myhand began a conciliatory address when whisk went the whole scenefrom before my eyes and i awaked to behold the form of my wife askingme if i were ill or had had the nightmare that i groaned so</s>  i toldher my dream and we laughed at it together</s> we must give way to the girls a little she said</s>  it is naturalyou know that they should wish us to appear a little as other peopledo</s>  the fact is our parlor is somewhat dilapidated think how manyyears we have lived in it without an article of new furniture</s> i hate new furniture i remarked in the bitterness of my soul</s>  ihate anything new</s> my wife answered me discreetly according to approved principles ofdiplomacy</s>  i was right</s>  she sympathized with me</s>  at the same time itwas not necessary she remarked that we should keep a hole in oursofacover and armchairthere would certainly be no harm in sendingthem to the upholsterers to be newcovered she didnt much mind forher part moving her plants to the south back room and the bird woulddo well enough in the kitchen i had often complained of him forsinging vociferously when i was reading aloud</s> so our sofa went to the upholsterers but the upholsterer was struckwith such horror at its clumsy antiquated unfashionable appearancethat he felt bound to make representations to my wife and daughterspositively it would be better for them to get a new one of atempting pattern which he showed them than to try to do anything withthat</s>  with a stitch or so here and there it might do for a basementdiningroom but for a parlor he gave it as his disinterestedopinionhe must say if the case were his own he should get etc</s> etc</s>  in short we had a new sofa and new chairs and the plants andthe birds were banished and some darkgreen blinds were put up toexclude the sun from the parlor and the blessed luminary was allowedthere only at rare intervals when my wife and daughters were outshopping and i acted out my uncivilized male instincts by pulling upevery shade and vivifying the apartment as in days of old</s> but this was not the worst of it</s>  the new furniture and new carpetformed an opposition party in the room</s>  i believe in my heart that forevery little household fairy that went out with the dear old thingsthere came in a tribe of discontented brownies with the new ones</s> these little wretches were always twitching at the gowns of my wifeand daughters jogging their elbows and suggesting odious comparisonsbetween the smart new articles and what remained of the old ones</s>  theydisparaged my writingtable in the corner they disparaged theoldfashioned lounge in the other corner which had been the maternalthrone for years they disparaged the worktable the workbasketwith constant suggestions of how such things as these would look incertain wellkept parlors where

 we never have had things like other people</s> yes and this open fire makes such a dust and this carpet is onethat shows every speck of dust it keeps one always on the watch</s> i wonder why papa

shut up and a holein the floor which kept the parlor warm and great heavy curtainsthat kept out all the light that was not already excluded by the greenshades</s> it was as proper and orderly a parlor as those of our most fashionableneighbors and when our friends called we took them stumbling intoits darkened solitude and opened a faint crack in one of thewindowshades and came down in our best clothes and talked with themthere</s>  our old friends rebelled at this and asked what they had doneto be treated so and complained so bitterly that gradually we letthem into the secret that there was a great south room which i hadtaken for my study where we all sat where the old carpet was downwhere the sun shone in at the great window where my wifes plantsflourished and the canarybird sang and my wife had her sofa in thecorner and the old brass andirons glistened and the wood firecrackledin short a room to which all the household fairies hademigrated</s> when they once had found that out it

kneebreeches and long stockings were worn andthis good man was offered a present of a very nice pair of black silkhose</s>  he declined saying he could not afford to wear them</s> not afford it</s>  said the friend why i give them to you</s> exactly but it will cost me not less than two hundred dollars totake them and i cannot do it</s> how is that</s> why in the first place i shall no sooner put

see them ourold things seem very well suited to each other</s> the girls laughed at this story and i then added in my mostdetermined mannerbut i must warn you girls that i have compromised to the

papa till we get our work said the girlswho to say the truth always exhibit a flattering interest inanything their papa writes and who have the good taste never tointerrupt his readings with any

upholstery</s> but there came in due time the wedding and the weddingreception andwe all went to see bill in his new house splendidly lighted up andcomplete from top to toe and everybody said what a lucky fellow hewas but that was about the end of it so far as our visiting wasconcerned</s>  the running in and dropping in and keeping latchkeysand making informal calls that had been forespoken seemed about aslikely as if bill had lodged in the tuileries</s> sophie who had always been one of your snapping sparkling busy sortof girls began at once to develop her womanhood and show herprinciples and was as different from her former self as yourcareworn mousing old cat is from your rollicking frisky kitten</s> not but that sophie was a good girl</s>  she had a capital heart agood true womanly one and was loving and obliging but still shewas one of the desperately painstaking conscientious sort ofwomen whose very blood as they grow older is devoured withanxiety and she came of

until he took to preaching on theneatness of the celestial city the unsullied crystal of its wallsand the polish of its golden pavement when the faces of all thehousewives were set zionward at once</s> now this solemn and earnest view of housekeeping is onerous enoughwhen a poor girl first enters on the care of a moderately furnishedhouse where the articles are not too expensive to be reasonablyrenewed as time and use wear them but it is infinitely worse when acataract of splendid furniture is heaped upon her carewhen splendidcrystals cut into her conscience and mirrors reflect her duties andmoth and rust stand ever ready to devour and sully in every room andpassageway</s> sophie was solemnly warned and instructed by all the mothers andauntsshe was warned of moths warned of cockroaches warned offlies warned of dust all the articles of furniture had their coversmade of cold holland linen in which they looked like bodies laidouteven the curtain tassels had each its little

thefeathers that floated above it</s> poor bill found very soon that his house and furniture were to be keptat such an ideal point of perfection that he needed another house tolive infor poor fellow

wistfully lingering in the cosy armchair between mywritingtable and my wifes sofa and saying with a sigh howconfoundedly pleasant things looked thereso pleasant to have abright open fire and geraniums

everything right but you see they wont lether</s>  theyve loaded her with so many things that have to be kept inlavender that the poor girl is actually getting thin and losing herhealth and then you

a bit of it</s>  sophie and aunt zeruah have fixed their throne up inour bedroom and there they sit all day long except at callinghoursand then sophie dresses herself and comes down</s>  aunt zeruah insistsupon it that the way is to put the whole house in order and shut allthe blinds and sit in your bedroom and then she says nothing getsout of place and she tells poor sophie the most hocuspocus

in perfect order and that it issuch a care off sophies mind that i ought to be willing to eat downcellar to the end of the chapter</s>  now you see chris my position isa delicate one because sophies folks all agree that if there isanything in creation that is ignorant and dreadful and mustnt beallowed his way anywhere its a man</s>  why youd think to hear auntzeruah talk that we were all like

best china and get the silver home from the bankand if we do that aunt zeruah doesnt sleep for a week beforehandgetting ready for it and for a week after getting things put awayand then she tells me that in sophies delicate state it really isabominable for me to increase her cares and so i invite fellows todine with me at delmonicos and then sophie cries and sophiesmother says it doesnt look respectable for a family man to be diningat public places but hang it a fellow wants a home somewhere</s> my wife soothed the chafed spirit and spake comfortably unto him andtold him that he knew there was the old loungingchair always readyfor him at our fireside</s>  and you know she said our things are allso plain that we are never tempted to mount any guard over them ourcarpets are nothing

papas paradoxes</s>  said jenny</s> yes said i that is my thesis which i shall nail up over themantelpiece there as luther nailed his to the church door</s>  it is timeto rake up the fire now but tomorrow night i will give you a paperon the economy of the beautiful</s>           come now we are to have papas paradox said jenny as soon as theteathings had been carried out</s> entre nous i must tell you that insensibly we had fallen into thehabit of taking our tea by my study fire</s>  tea you know is a merenothing in itself its only merit being its social and poeticassociations its warmth and fragrance and the more socially andinformally it can be dispensed the more in keeping with its airy andcheerful nature</s> our circle was enlightened this evening by the cheery visage of bobstephens seated as of right close to mariannes workbasket</s> you see bob said jenny papa has undertaken to prove that themost beautiful things are always the cheapest</s> im glad to hear that said bob for theres a carved antiquebookcase and studytable that i have my eye on and if this can in anyway be made to appearoh it wont be made to appear said jenny settling herself at herknitting only in some transcendental poetic sense such as papa canalways make out</s>  papa is more than half a poet and his truths turnout to be figures of rhetoric when one comes to apply them to mattersof fact</s> now miss jenny please remember my subject and thesis irepliedthat in housefurnishing there is nothing so economical asbeauty and i will make it good against all comers not by figures ofrhetoric but by figures of arithmetic</s>  i am going to be verymatteroffact and commonplace in my details and keep ever in viewthe addition table</s>  i will instance a case which has occurred undermy own observation</s> the economy of the beautifultwo of the houses lately built on the new land in boston were boughtby two friends philip and john</s>  philip had plenty of money and paidthe cash down for his house without feeling the slightest vacancy inhis pocket</s>  john who was an active rising young man just enteringon a flourishing business had expended all his moderate savings foryears in the purchase of his dwelling and still had a mortgageremaining which he hoped to clear off by his future successes</s>  philipbegins the work of furnishing as people do with whom money isabundant and who have simply to go from shop to shop and order allthat suits their fancy and is considered the thing in good society</s> john begins to furnish with very little money</s>  he has a wife and twolittle ones and he wisely deems that to insure to them a wellbuilthouse in an open airy situation with conveniences for warmingbathing and healthy living is a wise beginning in life but itleaves him little or nothing beyond</s> behold then philip and his wife well pleased going the rounds ofshops and stores in fitting up their new dwelling and let us followstep by step</s>  to begin with the wallpaper</s>  imagine a front and backparlor with foldingdoors with two south windows on the front andtwo looking on a back court after the general manner of city houses</s> we will suppose they require about thirty rolls of wallpaper</s>  philipbuys the heaviest french velvet with gildings and traceries at fourdollars a roll</s>  this by the time it has been put on with goldmouldings according to the most established taste of the bestpaperhangers will bring the wallpaper of the two rooms to a figuresomething like two hundred dollars</s>  now they proceed to the carpetstores and there are thrown at their feet by obsequious clerksvelvets and axminsters with flowery convolutions and medallioncentres as if the flower gardens of the tropics were whirling inwaltzes with graceful lines of arabesqueroses callas liliesknotted wreathed twined with blue and crimson and golden ribbonsdazzling marvels of color and tracery</s>  there is no restraint inpricefour or six dollars a yard it is all the same to themandsoon a magic flower garden blooms on the floors at a cost of fivehundred dollars</s>  a pair of elegant rugs at fifty dollars apiececomplete the inventory and bring our rooms to the mark of eighthundred dollars for papering and carpeting alone</s>  now come the greatmantelmirrors for four hundred more and our rooms progress</s>  thencomes the upholsterer and measures our four windows that he mayskillfully barricade them from air and sunshine</s>  the fortificationsagainst heaven thus prepared cost in the shape of damask cordtassels shades laces and cornices about two hundred dollars perwindow</s>  to be sure they make the rooms close and sombre as the gravebut they are of the most splendid stuffs and if the sun would onlyreflect he would see himself how foolish it was for him to try toforce himself into a window guarded by his betters</s>  if there isanything cheap and plebeian it is sunshine and fresh air</s>  behold usthen with our two rooms papered carpeted and curtained for twothousand dollars and now are to be put in them sofas loungestagres centretables screens chairs of every pattern and devicefor which it is but moderate to allow a thousand more</s>  we have now twoparlors furnished at an outlay of three thousand dollars without asingle picture a single article of statuary a single object of artof any kind and without any light to see them by if they were there</s> we must say for our boston upholsterers and furnituremakers that suchgood taste generally reigns in their establishments that roomsfurnished at haphazard from them cannot fail of a certain air of goodtaste so far as the individual things are concerned</s>  but thedifferent articles we have supposed having been ordered withoutreference to one another or the rooms have when brought together nounity of effect and the general result is scattering and confused</s>  ifasked how philips parlors look your reply is oh the usual way ofsuch parlorseverything that such people usually getmedallioncarpets carved furniture great mirrors bronze mantel ornaments andso on</s>  the only impression a stranger receives while waiting in thedim twilight of these rooms is that their owner is rich and able toget good handsome things such as all other rich people get</s> now our friend john as often happens in america is moving in thesame social circle with philip visiting the same peoplehis houseis the twin of the one philip has been furnishingand how shall hewith a few hundred dollars make his rooms even presentable besidethose which philip has fitted up elegantly at three thousand</s> now for the economy of beauty</s>  our friend must make his prayer to thegracesfor if they cannot save him nobody can</s>  one thing john hasto begin with that rare gift to man a wife with the magic cestus ofvenusnot around her waist but if such a thing could be in herfingerends</s>  all that she touches falls at once into harmony andproportion</s>  her eye for color and form is intuitive let her arrange agarret with nothing but boxes barrels and castoff furniture in itand ten to one she makes it seem the most attractive place in thehouse</s>  it is a veritable gift of good farie this tact ofbeautifying and arranging that some women have and on the presentoccasion it has a real material value that can be estimated indollars and cents</s>  come with us and you can see the pair taking theirsurvey of the yet unfurnished parlors as busy and happy as a coupleof bluebirds picking up the first sticks and straws for their nest</s> there are two sunny windows to begin with says the good fairy withan appreciative glance</s>  that insures flowers all winter</s> yes says john i never would look at a house without a good sunnyexposure</s>  sunshine is the best ornament of a house and worth an extrathousand a year</s> now for our wallpaper says she</s>  have you looked at wallpapersjohn</s> yes we shall get very pretty ones for thirtyseven cents a roll allyou want of a paper you know is to make a groundtint to throw outyour pictures and other matters and to reflect a pleasant tone oflight</s> well john you know uncle james says that a stone color is the bestbut i cant bear those cold blue grays</s> nor i says john</s>  if we must have gray let it at least be a graysuffused with gold or rose color such as you see at evening in theclouds</s> so i think responds she but better i should like a paper with atone of buffsomething that produces warm yellowish reflections andwill almost make you think the sun is shining in cold gray weatherand then there is nothing that lights up so cheerfully in the evening</s> in short john i think the color of a zafferano rose will be justabout the shade we want</s> well i can find that in good american paper as i said before atfrom thirtyseven to forty cents a roll</s>  then our bordering theresan important question for that must determine the carpet the chairsand everything else</s>  now what shall be the groundtint of our rooms</s> there are only two to choose between says the ladygreen andmaroon which is the best for the picture</s> i think says john looking above the mantelpiece as if he saw apicture therei think a border of maroon velvet with maroonfurniture is the best for the picture</s> i think so too said she and then we will have that lovely maroonand crimson carpet that i saw at lowes it is an ingrain to be surebut has a brussels pattern a mossy mixed figure of different shadesof crimson it has a good warm strong color and when i come to coverthe lounges and our two old armchairs with maroon rep it will makesuch a pretty effect</s> yes said john and then you know our picture is so bright itwill light up the whole</s>  everything depends on the picture</s> now as to the picture it has a story which must be told</s>  johnhaving been all his life a worshiper and adorer of beauty andbeautiful things had never passed to or from his business withoutstopping at the printshop windows and seeing a little of what wasthere</s> on one of these occasions he was smitten to the heart with the beautyof an autumn landscape where the red maples and sumachs the purpleand crimson oaks all stood swathed and harmonized together in thehazy indian summer atmosphere</s>  there was a great yellow chestnuttree on a distant hill which stood out so naturally that johninstinctively felt his fingers tingling for a basket and hisheels alive with a desire to bound over on to the rustling hillsideand pick up the glossy brown nuts</s>  everything was there of autumneven to the goldenrod and purple asters and scarlet creepers in theforeground</s> john went in and inquired</s>  it was by an unknown french artist withoutname or patrons who had just come to our shores to study our sceneryand this was the first picture he had exposed for sale</s>  john had justbeen paid a quarters salary he bethought him of boardbill andwasherwoman sighed and faintly offered fifty dollars</s> to his surprise he was taken up at once and the picture became his</s> john thought himself dreaming</s>  he examined his treasure over and overand felt sure that it was the work of no amateur beginner but of atrained hand and a true artist soul</s>  so he found his way to the studioof the stranger and apologized for having got such a gem for so muchless than its worth</s>  it was all i could give though he said andone who paid four times as much could not value it more</s>  and so johntook one and another of his friends with longer purses than his ownto the studio of the modest stranger and now his pieces command theirfull worth in the market and he works with orders far ahead of hisability to execute giving to the canvas the trails of americanscenery as appreciated and felt by the subtile delicacy of the frenchmindour rural summer views our autumn glories and the dreamymisty delicacy of our snowy winter landscapes</s>  whoso would know thetruth of the same let him inquire for the modest studio ofmorvillier at maiden scarce a bowshot from our boston</s> this picture had always been the ruling star of johns house his maindependence for brightening up his bachelor apartments and when hecame to the task of furbishing those same rooms for a fair occupantthe picture was still his mine of gold</s>  for a picture painted by areal artist who studies nature minutely and conscientiously hassomething of the charm of the good mother herselfsomething of herfaculty of putting on different aspects under different lights</s>  johnand his wife had studied their picture at all hours of the day theyhad seen how it looked when the morning sun came aslant the scarletmaples and made a golden shimmer over the blue mountains how itlooked toned down in the cool shadows of afternoon and how it warmedup in the sunset and died off mysteriously into the twilight and nowwhen larger parlors were to be furnished the picture was still thetower of strength the rallyingpoint of their hopes</s> do you know john said the wife hesitating i am really in doubtwhether we shall not have to get at least a few new chairs and a sofafor our parlors</s>  they are putting in such splendid things at the otherdoor that i am positively ashamed of ours the fact is they lookalmost disreputablelike a heap of rubbish</s> well said john laughing i dont suppose all together sent to anauctionroom would bring us fifty dollars and yet such as they arethey answer the place of better things for us and the fact is marythe hard impassable barrier in the case is that there really is nomoney to get any more</s> ah well then if there isnt we must see what we can do withthese and summon all the good fairies to our aid said mary</s> theres your little cabinetmaker john will look over the thingsand furbish them up theres that broken arm of the chair must bemended and everything revarnished then i have found such a lovelyrep of just the richest shade of maroon inclining to crimson andwhen we come to cover the lounges and armchairs and sofas and ottomansall alike you know they will be quite another thing</s> trust you for that mary</s>  by the bye ive found a nice little womanwho has worked on upholstery who will come in by the day and be thehands that shall execute the decrees of your taste</s> yes i am sure we shall get on capitally</s>  do you know that im almostglad we cant get new things</s>  its a sort of enterprise to see what wecan do with old ones</s> now you see mary said john seating himself on a limecask whichthe plasterers had left and taking out his memorandumbookyousee ive calculated this thing all over ive found a way by which ican make our rooms beautiful and attractive without a cent expended onnew furniture</s> well lets hear</s> well my way is short and simple</s>  we must put things into our roomsthat people will look at so that they will forget to look at thefurniture and never once trouble their heads about it</s>  people neverlook at furniture so long as there is anything else to look at justas napoleon when away on one of his expeditions being told that thefrench populace were getting disaffected wrote back gild the domedes invalides and so they gilded it and the people looking atthat forgot everything else</s> but im not clear yet said mary what is coming of thisrhetoric</s> well then mary ill tell you</s>  a suit of new carved blackwalnutfurniture severe in taste and perfect in style such as i shouldchoose at david  sauls could not be got under three hundreddollars and i havent the three hundred to give</s>  what then shall wedo</s>  we must fall back on our resources we must look over ourtreasures</s>  we have our proof cast of the great glorious head of thevenus di milo we have those six beautiful photographs of rome thatbrown brought to us we have the great german lithograph of thesan sisto mother and child and we have the two angel heads from thesame we have that lovely golden twilight sketch of heades we havesome sea photographs of bradfords we have an original penandinksketch by billings and then as before we have our picture</s> what has been the use of our watching at the gates and waiting at thedoors of beauty all our lives if she hasnt thrown us out a crustnow and then so that we might have it for time of need</s>  now yousee mary we must make the toilet of our rooms just as a prettywoman makes hers when money runs low and she sorts and freshens herribbons and matches them to her hair and eyes and with a bow hereand a bit of fringe there and a button somewhere else dazzles usinto thinking that she has an infinity of beautiful attire</s>  our roomsare new and pretty of themselves to begin with the tint of thepaper and the rich coloring of the border corresponding with thefurniture and carpets will make them seem prettier</s>  and now forarrangement</s>  take this front room</s>  i propose to fill those tworecesses each side of the fireplace with my books in their plainpine cases just breasthigh from the floor they are stained agood dark color and nobody need stick a pin in them to find outthat they are not rosewood</s>  the top of these shelves on either side tobe covered with the same stuff as the furniture finished with acrimson fringe</s>  on top of the shelves on one side of the fireplacei shall set our noble venus di milo and i shall buy at ciccis thelovely clytie and put it the other side</s>  then i shall get ofwilliams  everett two of their chromo lithographs which give youall the style and charm of the best english watercolor school</s>  i willhave the lovely bay of amalfi over my venus because she came fromthose suns and skies of southern italy and i will hang lake comoover my clytie</s>  then in the middle over the fireplace shall beour picture</s>  over each door shall hang one of the lithographedangel heads of the san sisto to watch our going out and coming inand the glorious mother and child shall hang opposite the venus dimilo to show how greek and christian unite in giving the noblesttype to womanhood</s>  and then when we have all our sketches andlithographs framed and hung here and there and your flowersblooming as they always do and your ivies wandering and rambling asthey used to and hanging in the most graceful ways and places andall those little shells and ferns and vases which you are alwaysconjuring with tastefully arranged ill venture to say that ourrooms will be not only pleasant but beautiful and that peoplewill oftener say how beautiful</s>  when they enter than if wespent three times the money on new furniture</s> in the course of a year after this conversation one and another ofmy acquaintances were often heard speaking of john mortons house</s> such beautiful roomsso charmingly furnishedyou must go and seethem</s>  what does make them so much pleasanter than those rooms in theother house which have everything in them that money can buy</s>  sosaid the folk for nine people out of ten only feel the effect of aroom and never analyze the causes from which it flows they know thatcertain rooms seem dull and heavy and confused but they dont knowwhy that certain others seem cheerful airy and beautiful but theyknow not why</s>  the first exclamation on entering johns parlors wasso often how beautiful</s>  that it became rather a byword in thefamily</s>  estimated by their mere money value the articles in the roomswere of very trifling worth but as they stood arranged and combinedthey had all the effect of a lovely picture</s>  although the statuary wasonly plaster and the photographs and lithographs such as were allwithin the compass of limited means yet every one of them was a goodthing of its own kind or a good reminder of some of the greatestworks of art</s>  a good plaster cast is a daguerreotype so to speak ofa great statue though it may be bought for five or six dollars whileits original is not to be had for any namable sum</s>  a chromo lithographof the best sort gives all the style and manner and effect of turneror stanfield or any of the best of modern artists though you buy itfor five or ten dollars and though the original would command athousand guineas</s>  the lithographs from raphaels immortal picture giveyou the results of a whole age of artistic culture in a form withinthe compass of very humble means</s>  there is now selling for fivedollars at williams  everetts a photograph of cheneys crayondrawing of the san sisto madonna and child which has the very spiritof the glorious original</s>  such a picture hung against the wall of achilds room would train its eye from infancy and yet how many willfreely spend five dollars in embroidery on its dress that say theycannot afford works of art</s> there was one advantage which john and his wife found in the way inwhich they furnished their house that i have hinted at before itgave freedom to their children</s>  though their rooms were beautifulit was not with the tantalizing beauty of expensive and frailknickknacks</s>  pictures hung against the wall and statuary safelylodged on brackets speak constantly to the childish eye but areout of the reach of childish fingers and are not upset by childishromps</s>  they are not like china and crystal liable to be used andabused by servants they do not wear out they are not spoiled bydust nor consumed by moths</s>  the beauty once there is always therethough the mother be ill and in her chamber she has no fears that sheshall find it all wrecked and shattered</s>  and this style of beautyinexpensive as it is compared with luxurious furniture is a meansof cultivation</s>  no child is ever stimulated to draw or to read by anaxminster carpet or a carved centretable but a room surrounded withphotographs and pictures and fine casts suggests a thousandinquiries stimulates the little eye and hand</s>  the child is foundwith its pencil drawing or he asks for a book on venice or wantsto hear the history of the roman forum</s> but i have made my article too long</s>  i will write another on the moraland intellectual effects of housefurnishing</s> i have proved my point miss jenny have i not</s>  in housefurnishingnothing is more economical than beauty</s> yes papa said jenny i give it up</s> vraking up the firewe have a custom at our house which we call raking up the fire</s>  thatis to say the last half hour before bedtime we draw in shoulder toshoulder around the last brands and embers of our hearth which weprick up and brighten and dispose for a few farewell

charactersgive ourviews on all subjects sthetic theological and scientific in a waymost wonderful to hear and in fact we sometimes get so engaged inour discussions that every spark of the fire burns out and we beginto feel ourselves shivering around the shoulders before we canremember that it is bedtime</s> so after the reading of my last article we had a rakinguptalkto wit jenny marianne and i with bob stephens my wifestill busy at her workbasket sat at the table a little behind us</s> jenny of course opened the ball in her usual incisive manner</s> but now papa after all you say in your piece there i cannot helpfeeling that if i had the taste and the money too it would be betterthan the taste alone with no money</s>  i like the nice arrangements andthe books and the drawings but i think all these would appear betterstill with really elegant furniture</s> who doubts that</s>  said i</s>  give me a large tub of gold coin to dipinto and the furnishing and beautifying of a house is a simpleaffair</s>  the same taste that could make beauty out of cents and dimescould make it more abundantly out of dollars and eagles</s>  but ihave been speaking for those who have not and cannot get richesand who wish to have agreeable houses and i begin in the outset bysaying that beauty is a thing to be respected reverenced anddevoutly cared for and then i say that beauty is cheapnay toput it so that the shrewdest yankee will understand itbeauty isthe cheapest thing you can have because in many ways it is asubstitute for expense</s>  a few vases of flowers in a room a fewblooming wellkept plants a few prints framed in fanciful framesof cheap domestic fabric a statuette a bracket an engraving apencilsketchabove all a few choice booksall these arranged bya woman who has the gift

wife laughing over her workbasket as she answeredgirls one of these days i will write an article for theatlantic that your papa need not have all the say to himselfhowever i believe he has hit the nail on the head this time</s> of course he has said marianne</s>  but mamma i am afraid to beginto depend much on plants for the beauty of my rooms for fear i shouldnot have your giftand of all

anexperience of her own love and talent in this line which makes hersure of success for plants will not thrive if they are forgotten oroverlooked and only tended in occasional intervals and as mariannesays neglected plants are the most forlorn of all things</s> but papa said marianne anxiously there in those patent parlorsof johns that you wrote of flowers acted a great part</s> the charm of those parlors of johns may be chemically analyzed isaid</s>  in the first place there is sunshine a thing that alwaysaffects the human nerves of happiness</s>  why else is it that people arealways so glad to see the sun after a long storm</s>  why are bright daysmatters of such congratulation</s>  sunshine fills a house with a thousandbeautiful and fanciful effects of light and shadewith

have shades which can atpleasure be drawn down from the top or up from the bottom so thatthe best light to be had may always be arranged for his littleinterior</s> well papa said marianne in your chemical analysis of johnsrooms what is the next thing to the sunshine</s> the next said i is harmony of color</s>  the wallpaper thefurniture the carpets are of tints that harmonize with one another</s> this is a grace in rooms always and one often neglected</s>  the frenchhave an expressive phrase with reference to articles which are out ofaccordthey say that they swear at each other i have been in roomswhere i seemed to hear the wallpaper swearing at the carpet and thecarpet swearing back at the wallpaper and each article of furnitureswearing at the rest</s>  these appointments may all of them be of themost expensive kind but with such disharmony no arrangement can everproduce anything but a vulgar and disagreeable effect</s>  on the otherhand i have been in rooms where all the material was cheap and thefurniture poor but where from some instinctive knowledge of thereciprocal effect of colors everything was harmonious and produced asense of elegance</s> i recollect once traveling on a western canal through a long stretchof wilderness and stopping to spend the night at an obscuresettlement of a dozen houses</s>  we were directed to lodgings in a commonframe house at a little distance where it seemed the only hotel waskept</s>  when we entered the parlor we were struck with utter amazementat its prettiness which affected us before we began to ask ourselveshow it

commonwooden rockingchairs and some ottomans probably made of oldsoapboxes were all covered with american nankeen of a softyellowishbrown with a bordering of blue print</s>  the windowshadesthe tablecover and the pianocloth all repeated the same colors inthe same cheap material</s>  a simple straw matting was laid over thefloor and with a few books a vase of flowers and one or twoprints the

the most inexpensivepossiblesimply the following out in cheap material a law ofuniformity and harmony which always will produce beauty</s>  in the samemanner i have seen a room furnished whose effect was really gorgeousin color where the only materials used were turkeyred cotton and asimple ingrain carpet of corresponding color</s> now you girls have been busy lately in schemes for buying a velvetcarpet for the new parlor that is to be and the only points that haveseemed to weigh in the council were that it was velvet that it wascheaper than velvets usually are and that it was a genteel pattern</s> now papa said jenny what ears you have</s>  we thought you werereading all the time</s> i see what you are going to say said marianne</s>  you think that wehave not once mentioned the consideration which should determine thecarpet whether it will harmonize with our other things</s>  but you seepapa we dont really know what our other things are to be</s> yes said jenny and aunt easygo said it was an unusually goodchance to get a velvet carpet</s> yet good as the chance is it costs just twice as much as aningrain</s> yes papa it does</s> and you are not sure that the effect of it after you get it downwill be as good as a wellchosen ingrain one</s> thats true said marianne reflectively</s> but then papa said jenny aunt easygo said she never heard ofsuch a bargain only

is undesirable</s>  said i</s> well you know papa he said those large patterns were not sosalable</s> to tell the truth said marianne i never did like the patternexactly as to uniformity of tint it

want</s> we want sixty yards for both rooms said jenny always primed withstatistics</s> that will be a hundred and twenty dollars i said</s> yes said jenny and we went over the figures together and thoughtwe could make it out by economizing in other things</s>  aunt easygo saidthat the carpet was half the battlethat it gave the air toeverything else</s> well marianne if you want a mans advice in the case mine is atyour service</s> that is just what i want papa</s> well then my dear choose your wallpapers and borderings andwhen they are up choose an ingrain carpet to harmonize with them

ill do it said marianne</s> my little dear said i your papa may seem to be a sleepy oldbookworm yet he has his eyes open</s>  do you think i dont know why mygirls have the credit of being the bestdressed girls on the street</s> oh papa</s>  cried out both girls in a breath</s> fact that</s>  said bob with energy pulling at his mustache</s> everybody talks about your dress and wonders how

would outlast two common carpets</s> but as you pay double price said i i dont see that</s>  besides iwould rather in the course of twenty years have two nice freshingrain carpets of just the color

credit to mariannesaccount and let her work out the problems of harmonious color invelvet and damask</s>  all i have to say is that certain unities ofcolor certain general arrangements will secure very nearly as goodgeneral effects in either material</s>  a library with a neat mossy greencarpet on the floor harmonizing with wallpaper and furniture looksgenerally as well whether the mossy green is made in brussels or iningrain</s>  in the carpet stores these two materials stand side by sidein the very same pattern and one is often as good for the purpose asthe other</s>  a lady of my acquaintance some years since employed anartist to decorate her parlors</s>  the walls being frescoed and tinted tosuit his ideal he immediately issued his decree that her splendidvelvet carpets must

equal to getting up to the high shelfwhere you keep it getting it down washing and putting it up again</s> but in serving a table i say as i said of a house beauty is anecessity and beauty is cheap</s>  because you cannot afford beauty inone form it does not follow that you cannot have it in another</s> because one cannot afford to keep up a perennial supply of delicatechina and crystal

guided by the eye of taste in the choice and arrangement ofeven the everyday table articles and have no ugly things when youcan have pretty ones by taking a little thought</s>  if you are soretempted

done andnot doing and every afternoon the young lady sat neatly dressed inher own apartment either writing letters to her betrothed or sewingon her bridal outfit</s>  such is the result of employing those who havebeen brought up to do their own work</s>  that tall finelooking girlfor aught we know may yet be mistress of a fine house on fifthavenue and if she is she will we fear prove rather an exactingmistress to irish biddy and bridget but she will never be threatenedby her cook and chambermaid after the first one or two have tried theexperiment</s>           having written thus far on my article i laid it aside till eveningwhen as usual i was saluted by the inquiry has papa been writinganything today</s>  and then followed loud petitions to hear it and soi read as far reader as you have</s> well papa said jenny what are you meaning to make out there</s>  doyou really think it would be best for us all to try to go back to thatold style of living you describe</s>  after all you have shown only thedark side of an establishment with servants and the bright side ofthe other way of living</s>  mamma does not have such trouble with herservants matters have always gone smoothly in our family and if weare not such wonderful girls as those you describe yet we may makepretty good housekeepers on the modern system after all</s> you dont know all the troubles your mamma has had in your day saidmy wife</s>  i have often in the course of my family history seen theday when i have heartily wished for the strength and ability to managemy household matters as my grandmother of notable memory managed hers</s> but i fear that those remarkable women of the olden times are like theancient painted glassthe art of making them is lost my mother wasless than her mother and i am less than my mother</s> and marianne and i come out entirely at the little end of the hornsaid jenny laughing yet i wash the breakfast cups and dust theparlors and have always fancied myself a notable housekeeper</s> it is just as i told you i said</s>  human nature is always the same</s> nobody ever is or does more than circumstances force him to be and do</s> those remarkable women of old were made by circumstances</s>  there werecomparatively speaking no servants to be had and so children weretrained to habits of industry and mechanical adroitness from thecradle and every household process was reduced to the very minimum oflabor</s>  every step required in a process was counted every movementcalculated and she who took ten steps when one would do lost herreputation for faculty</s>  certainly such an early drill was of use indeveloping the health and the bodily powers as well as in givingprecision to the practical mental faculties</s>  all household economieswere arranged with equal niceness in those thoughtful minds</s>  a trainedhousekeeper knew just how many sticks of hickory of a certain sizewere required to heat her oven and how many of each different kind ofwood</s>  she knew by a sort of intuition just what kind of food wouldyield the most palatable nutriment with the least outlay ofaccessories in cooking</s>  she knew to a minute the time when eacharticle must go into and be withdrawn from her oven and if she couldonly lie in her chamber and direct she could guide an intelligentchild through the processes with mathematical certainty</s>  it isimpossible however that anything but early training and longexperience can produce these results and it is earnestly to be wishedthat the grandmothers of new england had only written down theirexperiences for our children they would have been a mine of maximsand traditions better than any other traditions of the elders whichwe know of</s> one thing i know said marianne and that is i wish i had beenbrought up so and knew all that i should and had all the strengthand adroitness that those women had</s>  i should not dread to beginhousekeeping as i now do</s>  i should feel myself independent</s>  i shouldfeel that i knew how to direct my servants and what it was reasonableand proper to expect of them and then as you say i shouldnt bedependent on all their whims and caprices of temper</s>  i dread thosehousehold storms of all things</s> silently pondering these anxieties of the young expectant housekeeperi resumed my pen and concluded my paper as follows          in this country our democratic institutions have removed thesuperincumbent pressure which in the old world confines the servantsto a regular orbit</s>  they come here feeling that this is somehow a landof liberty and with very dim and confused notions of what liberty is</s> they are for the most part the raw untrained irish peasantry and thewonder is that with all the unreasoning heats and prejudices of theceltic blood all the necessary ignorance and rawness there should bethe measure of comfort and success there is in our domesticarrangements</s>  but so long as things are so there will be constantchanges and interruptions in every domestic establishment andconstantly recurring interregnums when the mistress must put her ownhand to the work whether the hand be a trained or an untrained one</s> as matters now are the young housekeeper takes life at the hardest</s> she has very little strengthno experience to teach her how to saveher strength</s>  she knows nothing experimentally of the simplestprocesses necessary to keep her family comfortably fed and clothedand she has a way of looking at all these things which makes themparticularly hard and distasteful to her</s>  she does not escape beingobliged to do housework at intervals but she does it in a weakblundering confused way that makes it twice as hard and disagreeableas it need be</s> now what i have to say is that if every young woman learned to dohousework and cultivated her practical faculties in early life shewould in the first place be much more likely to keep her servantsand in the second place if she lost them temporarily would avoidall that wear and tear of the nervous system which comes from constantillsuccess in those departments on which family health and tempermainly depend</s>  this is one of the peculiarities of our american lifewhich require a peculiar training</s>  why not face it sensibly</s> the second thing i have to say is that our land is now full ofmotorpathic institutions to which women are sent at great expense tohave hired operators stretch and exercise their inactive muscles</s>  theylie for hours to have their feet twigged their arms flexed and allthe different muscles of the body worked for them because they are soflaccid and torpid that the powers of life do not go on</s>  would it notbe quite as cheerful and less expensive a process if young girls fromearly life developed the muscles in sweeping dusting ironingrubbing furniture and all the multiplied domestic processes which ourgrandmothers knew of</s>  a woman who did all these and diversified theintervals with spinning on the great and little wheel never came toneed the gymnastics of dio lewis or of the swedish motorpathist whichreally are a necessity now</s>  does it not seem poor economy to payservants for letting our muscles grow feeble and then to payoperators to exercise them for us</s>  i will venture to say that ourgrandmothers in a week went over every movement that any gymnast hasinvented and went over them to some productive purpose too</s> lastly my paper will not have been in vain if those ladies who havelearned and practice the invaluable accomplishment of doing their ownwork will know their own happiness and dignity and properly valuetheir great acquisition even though it may have been forced upon themby circumstances</s> viiwhat can be got in americawhile i was preparing my article for the atlantic our friend bobstephens burst in upon us in some considerable heat with a newspaperin his hand</s> well girls your time is come now</s>  you women have been preachingheroism and sacrifice to usso splendid to go forth and sufferand die for our countryand now comes the test of femininepatriotism</s> why whats the matter now</s>  said jenny running eagerly to look overhis shoulder at the paper</s> no more foreign goods said he waving it aloftno more goldshipped to europe for silks laces jewels kid gloves and what not</s> here it isgreat movement headed by senators and generals wivesmrs</s>  general butler mrs</s>  john p</s>  hale mrs</s>  henry wilson and so ona long string of them to buy no more imported articles during thewar</s> but i dont see how it can be done said jenny</s> why said i do you suppose that nothing to wear is made inamerica</s> but dear mr</s>  crowfield said miss featherstone a nice girl whowas just then one of our family circle there is not positivelymuch that is really fit to use or wear made in americais there now</s> just think how is marianne to furnish her house here without frenchpapers and english carpets</s> those american papers are so veryordinary and as to american carpets everybody knows their colorsdont hold and then as to dress a lady must have gloves youknowand everybody knows no such things are made in america asgloves</s> i think i said that i have heard of certain fair ladies wishingthat they were men that they might show with what alacrity they wouldsacrifice everything on the altar of their country life and limbwould be nothing they would glory in wounds and bruises they wouldenjoy losing a right arm they wouldnt mind limping about on a lameleg the rest of their lives if they were john or peter if only theymight serve their dear country</s> yes said bob thats female patriotism</s>  girls are always ready tojump off from precipices or throw themselves into abysses but as towearing an unfashionable hat or thread gloves that they cantdonot even for their dear country</s>  no matter whether theres anymoney left to pay for the war or not the dear souls must have twentyyards of silk in a dressits the fashion you know</s> now isnt he too bad</s>  said marianne</s>  as if wed ever been asked tomake these sacrifices and refused</s>  i think i have seen women ready togive up dress and fashion and everything else for a good cause</s> for that matter said i the history of all wars has shown womenready to sacrifice what is most intimately feminine in times of perilto their country</s>  the women of carthage not only gave up their jewelsin the siege of their city but in the last extremity cut off theirhair for bowstrings</s>  the women of hungary and poland in theircountrys need sold their jewels and plate and wore ornaments of ironand lead</s>  in the time of our own revolution our women dressed inplain homespun and drank herbteaand certainly nothing is morefeminine than a cup of tea</s>  and in this very struggle the women ofthe southern states have cut up their carpets for blankets have bornethe most humiliating retrenchments and privations of all kinds withouta murmur</s>  so let us exonerate the female sex of want of patriotism atany rate</s> certainly said my wife and if our northern women have notretrenched and made sacrifices it has been because it has not beenimpressed on them that there is any particular call for it</s>  everythinghas seemed to be so prosperous and plentiful in the northern statesmoney has been so abundant and easy to come by that it has reallybeen difficult to realize that a dreadful and destructive war wasraging</s>  only occasionally after a great battle when the lists of thekilled and wounded have been sent through the country have we feltthat we were making a sacrifice</s>  the women who have spent such sumsfor laces and jewels and silks have not had it set clearly before themwhy they should not do so</s>  the money has been placed freely in theirhands and the temptation before their eyes</s> yes said jenny i am quite sure that there are hundreds who havebeen buying foreign goods who would not do it if they could see anyconnection between their not doing it and the salvation of thecountry but when i go to buy a pair of gloves i naturally want thebest pair i can find the pair that will last the longest and look thebest and these always happen to be french gloves</s> then said miss featherstone i never could clearly see why peopleshould confine their patronage and encouragement to works of their owncountry</s>  im sure the poor manufacturers of england have shown thevery noblest spirit with relation to our cause and so have the silkweavers and artisans of franceat least so i have heard why shouldwe not give them a fair share of encouragement particularly whenthey make things that we are not in circumstances to make have notthe means to make</s> those are certainly sensible questions i replied and ought tomeet a fair answer and i should say that were our country in afair ordinary state of prosperity there would be no reason why ourwealth should not flow out for the encouragement of welldirectedindustry in any part of the world from this point of view we mightlook on the whole world as our country and cheerfully assist indeveloping its wealth and resources</s>  but our country is now in thesituation of a private family whose means are absorbed by anexpensive sickness involving the life of its head just now it isall we can do to keep the family together all our means areswallowed up by our own domestic wants we have nothing to givefor the encouragement of other families we must exist ourselves wemust get through this crisis and hold our own and that we may doit all the family expenses must be kept within ourselves as far aspossible</s>  if we drain off all the gold of the country to send toeurope to encourage her worthy artisans we produce high pricesand distress among equally worthy ones at home and we lessen theamount of our resources for maintaining the great struggle fornational existence</s>  the same amount of money which we pay for foreignluxuries if passed into the hands of our own manufacturers andproducers becomes available for the increasing expenses of the war</s> but papa said jenny i understood that a great part of ourgovernmental income was derived from the duties on foreign goods andso i inferred that the more foreign goods were imported the better itwould be</s> well suppose said i that for every hundred thousand dollars wesend out of the country we pay the government ten thousand that isabout what our gain as a nation would be we send our gold abroad in agreat stream and give our government a little driblet</s> well but said miss featherstone what can be got in america</s> hardly anything i believe except common calicoes</s> begging your pardon my dear lady said i there is where you andmultitudes of others are greatly mistaken</s>  your partiality for foreignthings has kept you ignorant of what you have at home</s>  now i am notblaming the love of foreign things it is not peculiar to usamericans all nations have it</s>  it is a part of the poetry of ournature to love what comes from afar and reminds us of lands distantand different from our own</s>  the english belles seek after frenchlaces the french beauty enumerates english laces among her raritiesand the french dandy piques himself upon an english tailor</s>  weamericans are great travelers and few people travel i fancy withmore real enjoyment than we our domestic establishments as comparedwith those of the old world are less cumbrous and stately and so ourmoney is commonly in hand as pocketmoney to be spent freely andgayly in our tours abroad</s> we have such bright and pleasant times in every country that weconceive a kindliness for its belongings</s>  to send to paris for ourdresses and our shoes and our gloves may not be a mere bit of fopperybut a reminder of the bright pleasant hours we have spent in thatcity of boulevards and fountains</s>  hence it comes in a way not veryblamable that many people have been so engrossed with what can be gotfrom abroad that they have neglected to inquire what can be found athome they have supposed of course that to get a decent watch theymust send to geneva or to london that to get thoroughly good carpetsthey must have the english manufacture that a really tastefulwallpaper could be found only in paris and that flannels andbroadcloths could come only from france great britain or germany</s> well isnt it so</s>  said miss featherstone</s>  i certainly have alwaysthought so i never heard of american watches im sure</s> then said i im sure you cant have read an article that youshould have read on the waltham watches written by our friend georgew</s>  curtis in the atlantic for january of last year</s>  i must referyou to that to learn that we make in america watches superior to thoseof switzerland or england bringing into the service machinery andmodes of workmanship unequaled for delicacy and precision as i saidbefore you must get the article and read it and if some sunny dayyou could make a trip to waltham and see the establishment it wouldgreatly assist your comprehension</s> then as to mens clothing said bob i know to my entiresatisfaction that many of the most popular cloths for mens wear areactually american fabrics baptized with french and english names tomake them sell</s> which shows said i the use of a general community movement toemploy american goods</s>  it will change the fashion</s>  the demand willcreate the supply</s>  when the leaders of fashion are inquiring foramerican instead of french and english fabrics they will be surprisedto find what nice american articles there are</s>  the work of our ownhands will no more be forced to skulk into the market under french andenglish names and we shall see what is really true that an americangentleman need not look beyond his own country for a wardrobebefitting him</s>  i am positive that we need not seek broadcloth or otherwoolen goods from foreign landsthat better hats are made inamerica than in europe and better boots and shoes and i should beglad to send an american gentleman to the worlds fair dressed fromtop to toe in american manufactures with an american watch in hispocket and see if he would suffer in comparison with the gentlemen ofany other country</s> then as to housefurnishing began my wife american carpets aregetting to be every way equal to the english</s> yes said i and what is more the brussels carpets of england arewoven on looms invented by an american and bought of him</s>  ourcountryman bigelow went to england to study carpetweaving in theenglish looms supposing that all arts were generously open for theinstruction of learners</s>  he was denied the opportunity of studying themachinery and watching the processes by a shortsighted jealousy</s>  heimmediately sat down with a yard of carpeting and patientlyunraveling it thread by thread combined and calculated till heinvented the machinery on which the best carpets of the old and thenew world are woven</s>  no pains which such ingenuity and energy canrender effective are spared to make our fabrics equal those of thebritish market and we need only to be disabused of the old prejudiceand to keep up with the movement of our own country and find out ourown resources</s>  the fact is every year improves our fabrics</s>  ourmechanics our manufacturers are working with an energy a zeal anda skill that carry things forward faster than anybody dreams of andnobody can predicate the character of american articles in anydepartment now by their character even five years ago</s> well as to wallpapers said miss featherstone there you mustconfess the french are and must be unequaled</s> i do not confess any such thing said i hardily</s>  i grant you thatin that department of paperhangings which exhibits floral decorationthe french designs and execution are and must be for some time tocome far ahead of all the world their drawing of flowers vines andfoliage has the accuracy of botanical studies and the grace offinished works of art and we cannot as yet pretend in america to doanything equal to it</s>  but for satin finish and for a variety ofexquisite tints of plain colors american papers equal any in theworld our gilt papers even surpass in the heaviness and polish of thegilding those of foreign countries and we have also gorgeous velvets</s> all i have to say is let people who are furnishing houses inquire forarticles of american manufacture and they will be surprised at whatthey will see</s>  we need go no farther than our cambridge glassworks tosee that the most dainty devices of cutglass crystal ground andengraved glass of every color and pattern may be had of americanworkmanship every way equal to the best european make and for halfthe price</s>  and american painting on china is so well executed both inboston and new york that deficiencies in the finest french or englishsets can be made up in a style not distinguishable from the originalas one may easily see by calling on our worthy next neighbor briggswho holds the opposite corner to our atlantic monthly</s>  no porcelainit is true is yet made in america these decorative arts beingexercised on articles imported from europe</s>  our tables musttherefore perforce be largely indebted to foreign lands for years tocome</s>  exclusive of this item however i believe it would require verylittle selfdenial to paper carpet and furnish a house entirely fromthe manufactures of america</s>  i cannot help saying one word here infavor of the cabinetmakers of boston</s>  there is so much severity oftaste such a style and manner about the bestmade boston furnitureas raises it really quite into the region of the fine arts</s>  ourartisans have studied foreign models with judicious eyes and sotransferred to our country the spirit of what is best worth imitatingthat one has no need to import furniture from europe</s> well said miss featherstone there is one point you cannot makeoutgloves certainly the french have the monopoly of thatarticle</s> i am not going to ruin my cause by asserting too much said i</s>  ihavent been with nicely dressed women so many years not to speakwith proper respect of alexanders gloves and i confess honestly thatto forego them must be a fair square sacrifice to patriotism</s>  butthen on the other hand it is nevertheless true that gloves have longbeen made in america and surreptitiously brought into market asfrench</s>  i have lately heard that very nice kid gloves are made atwatertown and in philadelphia</s>  i have only heard of them and not seen</s> a loud demand might bring forth an unexpected supply from these andother sources</s>  if the women of america were bent on having gloves madein their own country how long would it be before apparatus andfactories would spring into being</s>  look at the hoopskirt factorieswomen wanted hoopskirtswould have them or dieand forthwithfactories arose and hoopskirts became as the dust of the earth forabundance</s> yes said miss featherstone and to say the truth the americanhoopskirts are the only ones fit to wear</s>  when we were living on thechamps lyses i remember we searched high and low for something likethem and finally had to send home to america for some</s> well said i that shows what i said</s>  let there be only a heartycall for an article and it will come</s>  these spirits of the vasty deepare not so very far off after all as we may imagine and womensunions and leagues will lead to inquiries and demands which will asinfallibly bring supplies as a vacuum will create a draught of air</s> but at least there are no ribbons made in america said missfeatherstone</s> pardon my lady there is a ribbon factory now in operation inboston and ribbons of every color are made in new york there is alsoin the vicinity of boston a factory which makes roman scarfs</s>  thisshows that the faculty of weaving ribbons is not wanting to usamericans and a zealous patronage would increase the supply</s> then as for a thousand and one little feminine needs i believe ourmanufacturers can supply them</s>  the portsmouth steam company makeswhite spoolcotton equal to any in england and colored spoolcottonof every shade and variety such as is not made either in england orfrance</s>  pins are well made in america so are hooks and eyes and avariety of buttons</s>  straw bonnets of american manufacture are alsoextensively in market and quite as pretty ones as the doublepricedones which are imported</s> as to silks and satins i am not going to pretend that they are to befound here</s>  it is true there are silk manufactories like that of thecheneys in connecticut where very pretty foulard dresssilks aremade together with sewingsilk enough to supply a large demand</s> enough has been done to show that silks might be made in america butat present as compared with europe we claim neither silks nor threadlaces among our manufactures</s> but what then</s>  these are not necessaries of life</s>  ladies can be verytastefully dressed in other fabrics besides silks</s>  there are manypretty american dressgoods which the leaders of fashion might makefashionable and certainly no leader of fashion could wish to dressfor a nobler object than to aid her country in deadly peril</s> it is not a lifepledge not a total abstinence that is askedonlya temporary expedient to meet a stringent crisis</s>  we only ask apreference for american goods where they can be found</s>  surely womenwhose exertions in sanitary fairs have created an era in the historyof the world will not shrink from so small a sacrifice for so obviousa good</s> here is something in which every individual woman can help</s>  everywoman who goes into a shop and asks for american goods renders anappreciable aid to our cause</s>  she expresses her opinion and herpatriotism and her voice forms a part of that demand

flourish under ourwelldirected efforts</s>  we shall come out of our great contest notbedraggled ragged and povertystricken but developed instructedand rich</s>  then will we gladly join with other nations in the freeinterchange of manufactures and gratify our eye and taste with whatis foreign while we can in turn send abroad our own productions inequal ratio</s> upon my word said miss featherstone i should think it was thefourth of july but i yield the point</s>  i am convinced and henceforthyou will see me among the most stringent of the leaguers</s> right</s>  said i</s> and fair lady reader let me hope you will say the same</s>  you can dosomething for your countryit lies right in your hand</s>  go to theshops determined on supplying your family and yourself with

said jenny as she twirled a little hat on her handwhich she had been making over with nobody knows what of bows andpompons and other matters for which the women have curiousnamesthe fact is american

 crowfield said miss featherstone i never sawsuch little economists as your daughters it is perfectly wonderfulwhat they contrive to dress on</s>  how they manage to do it im sure icant see</s>  i never could im convinced</s> yes said jenny ive bought but just one new hat</s>  i only wish youcould sit in church where we do and see those miss fielders</s>  marianneand i have counted six new hats

therell be something else</s> yes said miss featherstonetheir father they say has made amillion dollars lately on government contracts</s> for my part said jenny i think such extravagance at such a timeas this is shameful</s> do you know said i that im quite sure the misses fielder thinkthey are practicing rigorous economy</s> papa</s>  now there you are with your paradoxes</s>  how can you say so</s> i shouldnt be afraid to bet a pair of gloves now said i thatmiss fielder thinks herself half ready for translation because shehas bought only six new hats and a tulle bonnet so far in the season</s> if it were not for her dear bleeding country she would have hadthirtysix like the misses sibthorpe</s>  if we were admitted to thesecret councils of the fielders doubtless we should perceive whattemptations they daily resist how perfectly rubbishy and dreadfulthey suffer themselves to be because they feel it important now inthis crisis to practice economy how they abuse the sibthorpes whohave a new hat every time they drive out and never think of wearingone more than two or three times how virtuous and selfdenying theyfeel when they think of the puffed tulle for which they only gaveeighteen dollars when madame caradori showed them those lovely oneslike the misses sibthorpes for fortyfive and how they go homedescanting on virgin simplicity and resolving that they will notallow themselves to be swept into the vortex of extravagance whateverother people may do</s> do you know said miss featherstone i believe your papa is right</s> i was calling on the oldest miss fielder the other day and she toldme that she positively felt ashamed to go looking as she did but thatshe really did feel the necessity of economy</s>  perhaps we might affordto spend more than some others she said but its so much better togive the money to the sanitary commission</s> furthermore said i i am going to put forth another paradox andsay that very likely there are some people looking on my girls andcommenting on them for extravagance in having three hats even thoughmade over and contrived from last years stock</s> they cant know anything about it then said jenny decisivelyfor certainly nobody can be decent and invest less in millinerythan marianne and i do</s> when i was a young lady said my wife a welldressed girl got hera new bonnet in the spring and another in the fall that was theextent of her purchases in this line</s>  a secondbest bonnet left oflast year did duty to relieve and preserve the best one</s>  my fatherwas accounted welltodo but i had no more and wanted no more</s>  ialso bought myself every spring two pair of gloves a dark and alight pair and wore them through the summer and another two throughthe winter one or two pair of white kids carefully cleaned carriedme through all my parties</s>  hats had not been heard of and the greatnecessity which requires two or three new ones every spring and fallhad not arisen</s>  yet i was reckoned a wellappearing girl who dressedliberally</s>  now a young lady who has a waterfallhat an oriolehatand a jockey must still be troubled with anxious cares for her springand fall and summer and winter bonnetsall the variety will not takethe place of them</s>  gloves are bought by the dozen and as to dressesthere seems to be no limit to the quantity of material and trimmingthat may be expended upon them</s>  when i was a young lady seventyfivedollars a year was considered by careful parents a liberal allowancefor a daughters wardrobe</s>  i had a hundred and was reckoned rich andi sometimes used a part to make up the deficiencies in the allowanceof sarah evans my particular friend whose father gave her onlyfifty</s>  we all thought that a very scant allowance yet she generallymade a very pretty and genteel appearance with the help of occasionalpresents from friends</s> how could a girl dress for fifty dollars</s>  said marianne</s> she could get a white muslin and a white cambric which withdifferent sortings of ribbons served her for all dress occasions</s>  asilk in those days took only ten yards in the making and one darksilk was considered a reasonable allowance to a ladys wardrobe</s>  oncemade it stood for somethingalways worn carefully it lasted foryears</s>  one or two calico morningdresses and a merino for winterwear completed the list</s>  then as to collars capes cuffs etc</s>  weall did our own embroidering and very pretty things we wore too</s> girls looked as prettily then as they do now when four or fivehundred dollars a year is insufficient to clothe them</s> but mamma you know our allowance isnt anything like thatit isquite a slender one though not so small as yours was said marianne</s> dont you think the customs of society make a difference</s>  do youthink as things are we could go back and dress for the sum youdid</s> you cannot said my wife without a greater sacrifice of feelingthan i wish to impose on you</s>  still though i dont see how to helpit i cannot but think that the requirements of fashion are becomingneedlessly extravagant particularly in regard to the dress of women</s> it seems to me it is making the support of families so burdensomethat young men are discouraged from marriage</s>  a young man in amoderately good business might cheerfully undertake the world with awife who could make herself pretty and attractive for seventyfivedollars a year when he might sigh in vain for one who positivelycould not get through and be decent on four hundred</s>  women too aregetting to be so attached to the trappings and accessories of lifethat they cannot think of marriage without an amount of fortune whichfew young men possess</s> you are talking in very low numbers about the dress of women saidmiss featherstone</s>  i do assure you that it is the easiest thing inthe world for a girl to make away with a thousand dollars a year andnot have so much to show for it either as marianne and jenny</s> to be sure said i</s>  only establish certain formulas of expectationand it is the easiest thing in the world</s>  for instance in yourmothers day girls talked of a pair of glovesnow they talk of apack then it was a bonnet summer and winternow it is a bonnetspring summer autumn and winter and hats like monthly rosesanew blossom every few weeks</s> and then said my wife every device of the toilet is immediatelytaken up and varied and improved on so as to impose an almost monthlynecessity for novelty</s>  the jackets of may are outshone by thejackets of june the buttons of

jenny after all its just the way things alwayshave been since the world began</s>  you know the bible says can a maidforget her ornaments</s>  its clear she cant</s>  you see its a law ofnature and you remember all that long chapter in the bible that wehad read in church last sunday about the curls and veils and tinklingornaments and crimpingpins and all that of those wicked daughtersof zion in

those who would confine herideas to the kitchen and nursery</s> there is reason in all things said i</s>
 womans rights conventionsare a protest against many former absurd unreasonable ideasthemere physical and culinary idea of womanhood as connected only withpuddings and shirtbuttons the unjust and unequal burdens which thelaws of harsher ages had cast upon the sex</s>  many of the womenconnected with these movements are as superior in everything properlywomanly as they are in exceptional talent

reason why sister wife and mother should be more powerless inthe state than in the home</s>  nor does it make a woman unwomanly toexpress an opinion by dropping a slip of paper into a box more thanto express that same opinion by conversation</s>  in fact there is nodoubt that in all matters relating to the interests of educationtemperance and religion the state would be a material gainer byreceiving the votes of women</s> but having said all this i must admit per contra not only agreat deal of crude disagreeable talk in these conventions but atoo great tendency of the age to make the education of womenantidomestic</s>  it seems as if the world never could advance exceptlike ships under a head wind tacking and going too far now inthis direction and now in the opposite</s>  our

this and of the evilsthat come from it is that society by and by will turn as blindlyagainst female intellectual culture as it now advocates it andhaving worked disproportionately one way will work disproportionatelyin the opposite direction</s> the fact is said my wife that domestic service is the greatproblem of life here in america the happiness of families theirthrift wellbeing and comfort are more affected by this than by anyone thing else</s>  our girls as they have been brought up cannotperform the labor of their own families as in those simpleroldfashioned days you tell of and what

one</s>           so i sat down and wrote thus onservants and servicemany of the domestic evils in america originate in the fact thatwhile society here is professedly based on new principles which oughtto make social life in every respect different from the life of theold world yet these principles have never been so thought out andapplied as to give consistency and harmony to our daily relations</s> america starts with a political organization based on a declaration ofthe primitive freedom and equality of all men</s>  every human beingaccording to this principle stands on the same natural level withevery other and has the same chance to rise according to the degreeof power or capacity given by the creator</s>  all our civil institutionsare designed to preserve this equality as far as possible fromgeneration to generation there is no entailed property there are nohereditary titles no monopolies no privileged classesall are tobe as free to rise and fall as the waves of the sea</s> the condition of domestic service however still retains about itsomething of the influences from feudal times and from the nearpresence of slavery in neighboring states</s>  all english literature allthe literature of the world describes domestic service in the oldfeudal spirit and with the old feudal language which regarded themaster as belonging to a privileged class and the servant to aninferior one</s>  there is not a play not a poem not a novel not ahistory that does not present this view</s>  the masters rights likethe rights of kings were supposed to rest in his being born in asuperior rank</s>  the good servant was one who from childhood hadlearned to order himself lowly and reverently to all his betters</s> when new england brought to these shores the theory of democracy shebrought in the persons of the first pilgrims the habits of thoughtand of action formed in aristocratic communities</s>  winthrops journaland all the old records of the earlier colonists show householdswhere masters and mistresses stood on the right divine of theprivileged classes howsoever they might have risen up againstauthorities themselves</s> the first consequence of this state of things was a universalrejection of domestic service in all classes of americanborn society</s> for a generation or two there was indeed a sort of interchange offamily strengthsons and daughters engaging in the service ofneighboring families in default of a sufficient working force oftheir own but always on conditions of strict equality</s>  the assistantwas to share the table the family sittingroom and every honor andattention that might be claimed by son or daughter</s>  when familiesincreased in refinement and education so as to make these conditionsof close intimacy with more uncultured neighbors disagreeable theyhad to choose between such intimacies and the performance of theirown domestic toil</s>  no wages could induce a son or daughter of newengland to take the condition of a servant on terms which they thoughtapplicable to that of a slave</s>  the slightest hint of a separate tablewas resented as an insult not to enter the front door and not to sitin the front parlor on state occasions was bitterly commented on as apersonal indignity</s> the welltaught selfrespecting daughters of farmers the class mostvaluable in domestic service gradually retired from it</s>  theypreferred any other employment however laborious</s>  beyond all doubtthe labors of a wellregulated family are more healthy more cheerfulmore interesting because less monotonous than the mechanical toilsof a factory yet the girls of new england with one consentpreferred the factory and left the whole business of domestic serviceto a foreign population and they did it mainly because they would nottake positions in families as an inferior laboring class by the sideof others of their own age who assumed as their prerogative to livewithout labor</s> i cant let you have one of my daughters said an energetic matronto her neighbor from the city who was seeking for a servant in hersummer vacation if you hadnt daughters of your own maybe i wouldbut my girls aint going to work so that your girls may live inidleness</s> it was vain to offer money</s>  we dont need your money maam we cansupport ourselves in other ways my girls can braid straw and bindshoes but they aint going to be slaves to anybody</s> in the irish and german servants who took the place of americans infamilies there was to begin with the tradition of education infavor of a higher class but even the foreign population became moreor less infected with the spirit of democracy</s>  they came to thiscountry with vague notions of freedom and equality and in ignorantand uncultivated people such ideas are often more unreasonable forbeing vague</s>  they did not indeed claim a seat at the table and inthe parlor but they repudiated many of those habits of respect andcourtesy which belonged to their former condition and asserted theirown will and way in the round unvarnished phrase which they supposedto be their right as republican citizens</s>  life became a sort ofdomestic wrangle and struggle between the employers who secretlyconfessed their weakness but endeavored openly to assume the air andbearing of authority and the employed who knew their power andinsisted on their privileges</s>  from this cause domestic service inamerica has had less of mutual kindliness than in old countries</s>  itsterms have been so ill understood and defined that both parties haveassumed the defensive and a common topic of conversation in americanfemale society has often been the general servile war which in oneform or another was going on in their different familiesa war asinterminable as would be a struggle between aristocracy and commonpeople undefined by any bill of rights or constitution and thereforeopening fields for endless disputes</s>  in england the class who go toservice are a class and service is a profession the distancebetween them and their employers is so marked and defined and all thecustoms and requirements of the position are so perfectly understoodthat the master or mistress has no fear of being compromised bycondescension and no need of the external voice or air of authority</s> the higher up in the social scale one goes the more courteous seemsto become the intercourse of master and servant the more perfect andreal the power the more is it veiled in outward expressioncommandsare phrased as requests and gentleness of voice and manner covers anauthority

sufferings of distressedneedlewomen of the exactions and extortions practiced on the frailsex in the many branches of labor and trade at which they try theirhands and yet women will encounter all these chances of ruin andstarvation rather than make up their minds to permanent domesticservice</s>  now what is the matter with domestic service</s>  one wouldthink on the face of it that a calling which gives a settled home acomfortable room rentfree with fire and lights good board andlodging and steady wellpaid wages would certainly offer moreattractions than the making of shirts for tenpence with all the risksof providing ones own sustenance and shelter</s> i think it is mainly from the want of a definite idea of the trueposition of a servant under our democratic institutions that domesticservice is so shunned and avoided in america that it is the very lastthing which an intelligent young woman will look to for a living</s>  itis more the want of personal respect toward those in that positionthan the labors incident to it which repels our people from it</s>  manywould be willing to perform these labors but they are not willing toplace themselves in a situation where their selfrespect is hourlywounded by the implication of a degree of inferiority which does notfollow any kind of labor or service in this country but that of thefamily</s> there exists in the minds of employers an unsuspected spirit ofsuperiority which is stimulated into an active form by the resistancewhich democracy inspires in the working class</s>  many families think ofservants only as a necessary evil their wages as exactions and allthat is allowed them as so much taken from the family and they seekin every way to get from them as much and to give them as little aspossible</s>  their rooms are the neglected illfurnished incommodiousonesand the kitchen is the most cheerless and comfortless place inthe house</s>  other families more goodnatured and liberal providetheir domestics with more suitable accommodations and are moreindulgent but there is still a latent spirit of something likecontempt for the position</s>  that they treat their servants with so muchconsideration seems to them a merit entitling them to the mostprostrate gratitude and they are constantly disappointed and shockedat that want of sense of inferiority on the part of these people whichleads them to

why a servingmaid should not want to lookpretty as well as her mistress</s>  she is a woman as well as they withall a womans wants and weaknesses and her dress is as much to her astheirs to them</s> a vast deal of trouble among servants arises from impertinentinterferences and petty tyrannical exactions on the part of employers</s> now the authority of the master and mistress of a house in regard

thedisposal of their time than with any mechanic whom they employ</s>  theyhave indeed a right to regulate the hours of their own householdand servants can choose between conformity to these hours and the lossof their situation but within reasonable limits their right to comeand go at their own discretion in their own time should beunquestioned</s> if employers are troubled by the fondness of their

good table</s>  solong as she had puff pastry rich black cake clear jelly andpreserves she seemed to consider that such unimportant matters asbread butter and meat could take care of themselves</s>  it is the sameinattention to common things as that which leads people to buildhouses with stone fronts and windowcaps and expensive frontdoortrimmings without bathingrooms or fireplaces or ventilators</s> those who go into the country looking for summer board in farmhousesknow perfectly well that a table where the butter is always fresh thetea and coffee of the best kinds and well made and the meats properlykept dressed and served is the one table of a hundred the fabulousenchanted island</s>  it seems impossible to get the idea into the mindsof people that what is called common food carefully preparedbecomes in virtue of that very care and attention a delicacysuperseding the necessity of artificially compounded dainties</s> to begin then with the very foundation of a good tablebreadwhat ought it to be</s>  it should be light sweet and tender</s> this matter of lightness is the distinctive line between savage andcivilized bread</s>  the savage mixes simple flour and water into balls ofpaste which he throws into boiling water and which come out solidglutinous masses of which his common saying is man eat dis he nodiewhich a facetious traveler who was obliged to subsist on itinterpreted to mean dis no kill you nothing will</s>  in short itrequires the stomach of a wild animal or of a savage to digest thisprimitive form of bread and of course more or less attention in allcivilized modes of bread making is given to producing lightness</s>  bylightness is meant simply that the particles are to be separated fromeach other by little holes or aircells and all the different methodsof making light bread are neither more nor less than the formation inbread of these aircells</s> so far as we know there are four practicable methods of aeratingbread namely by fermentation by effervescence of an acid and analkali by aerated egg or egg which has been filled with air by theprocess of beating and lastly by pressure of some gaseous substanceinto the paste by a process much resembling the impregnation of waterin a soda fountain</s>  all these have one and the same objectto giveus the cooked particles of our flour separated by such permanentaircells as will enable the stomach more readily to digest them</s> a very common mode of aerating bread in america is by the effervescenceof an acid and an alkali in the flour</s>  the carbonic acid gas thus formedproduces minute aircells in the bread or as the cook says makes itlight</s>  when this process is performed with exact attention tochemical laws so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize eachother leaving no overplus of either the result is often verypalatable</s>  the difficulty is that this is a happy conjunction ofcircumstances which seldom occurs</s>  the acid most commonly employed isthat of sour milk and as milk has many degrees of sourness the ruleof a certain quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily producevery different results at different times</s>  as an actual fact wherethis mode of making bread prevails as we lament to say it does to agreat extent in this country one finds five cases of failure to oneof success</s>  it is a woful thing that the daughters of new england haveabandoned the old respectable mode of yeast brewing and bread raisingfor this specious substitute so easily made and so seldom wellmade</s>  the green clammy acrid substance called biscuit which manyof our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in these days iswholly unworthy of the men and women of the republic</s>  good patriotsought not to be put off in that waythey deserve better fare</s> as an occasional variety as a household convenience for obtainingbread or biscuit at a moments notice the process of effervescencemay be retained but we earnestly entreat american housekeepers inscriptural language to stand in the way and ask for the old pathsand return to the good yeastbread of their sainted grandmothers</s> if acid and alkali must be used by all means let them be mixed in dueproportions</s>  no cook should be left to guess and judge for herselfabout this matter</s>  there is an article called prestons infallibleyeast powder which is made by chemical rule and produces veryperfect results</s>  the use of this obviates the worst dangers in makingbread by effervescence</s> of all processes of aeration in breadmaking the oldest and mosttimehonored is by fermentation</s>  that this was known in the days ofour saviour is evident from the forcible simile in which he comparesthe silent permeating force of truth in human society to the veryfamiliar household process of raising bread by a little yeast</s> there is however one species of yeast much used in some parts ofthe country against which i have to enter my protest</s>  it is calledsaltrisings or milkrisings and is made by mixing flour milk anda little salt together and leaving them to ferment</s>  the bread thusproduced is often very attractive when new and made with great care</s> it is white and delicate with fine even aircells</s>  it has howeverwhen kept some characteristics which remind us of the terms in whichour old english bible describes the effect of keeping the manna of theancient israelites which we are informed in words more explicit thanagreeable stank and bred worms</s>  if saltrising bread does notfulfill the whole of this unpleasant description it certainly doesemphatically a part of it</s>  the smell which it has in baking and whenmore than a day old suggests the inquiry whether it is the saccharineor the putrid fermentation with which it is raised</s>  whoever breaks apiece of it after a day or two will often see minute filaments orclammy strings drawing out from the fragments which with theunmistakable smell will cause him to pause before consummating anearer acquaintance</s> the fermentation of flour by means of brewers or distillers yeastproduces if rightly managed results far more palatable andwholesome</s>  the only requisites for success in it are first goodmaterials and second great care in a few small things</s>  there arecertain lowpriced or damaged kinds of flour which can never by anykind of domestic chemistry be made into good bread and to thosepersons whose stomachs forbid them to eat gummy glutinous pasteunder the name of bread there is no economy in buying these poorbrands even at half the price of good flour</s> but good flour and good yeast being supposed with a temperaturefavorable to the development of fermentation the whole success of theprocess depends on the thorough diffusion of the proper proportionof yeast through the whole mass and on stopping the subsequentfermentation at the precise and fortunate point</s>  the true housewifemakes her bread the sovereign of her kitchenits behests must beattended to in all critical points and moments no matter what elsebe postponed</s>  she who attends to her bread when she has done thisand arranged that and performed the

fixing the aircells bybaking</s>  a few minutes now and the acetous fermentation will beginand the whole result be spoiled</s>  many breadmakers pass in uttercarelessness over this sacred and mysterious boundary</s>  their oven hascake in it or they are skimming jelly or attending to some otherof the socalled higher branches of cookery while the bread isquickly passing into the acetous stage</s>  at last when they are readyto attend to it they find that it has been going its own wayit isso sour that the pungent smell is plainly perceptible</s>  now thesaleratusbottle is handed down and a quantity of the dissolvedalkali mixed with the pastean expedient sometimes making itselftoo manifest by greenish streaks or small acrid spots in the bread</s>  asthe result we have a beautiful article spoiledbread withoutsweetness if not absolutely sour</s> in the view of many lightness is the only property required in thisarticle</s>  the delicate refined sweetness which exists in carefullykneaded bread baked just before it passes to the extreme point offermentation is something of which they have no conception and thusthey will even regard this process of spoiling the paste by theacetous fermentation and then rectifying that acid by effervescencewith an alkali as something positively meritorious</s>  how else can theyvalue and relish bakers loaves such as some are drugged withammonia and other disagreeable things light indeed so light thatthey seem to have neither weight nor substance but with no moresweetness or taste than so much white cotton</s> some persons prepare bread for the oven by simply mixing it in themass without kneading pouring it into pans and suffering it to risethere</s>  the aircells in bread thus prepared are coarse and uneven thebread is as inferior in delicacy and nicety to that which is wellkneaded as a raw irish servant to a perfectly educated and refinedlady</s>  the process of kneading seems to impart an evenness to theminute aircells a fineness of texture and a tenderness andpliability to the whole substance that can be gained in no otherway</s> the divine principle of beauty has its reign over bread as well asover all other things it has its laws of sthetics and that breadwhich is so prepared that it can be formed into separate andwellproportioned loaves each one carefully worked and mouldedwill develop the most beautiful results</s>  after being moulded theloaves should stand a little while just long enough to allow thefermentation going on in them to expand each little aircell tothe point at which it stood before it was worked down and thenthey should be immediately put into the oven</s> many a good thing however is spoiled in the oven</s>  we cannot butregret for the sake of bread that our old steady brick ovenshave been almost universally superseded by those of ranges andcookingstoves which are infinite in their caprices and forbid allgeneral rules</s>  one thing however may be borne in mind as aprinciplethat the excellence of bread in all its varietiesplain or sweetened depends on the perfection of its aircellswhether produced by yeast egg or effervescence that one of theobjects of baking is to fix these aircells and that the quicker thiscan be done through the whole mass the better will the result be</s> when cake or bread is made heavy by baking too quickly it isbecause the immediate formation of the top crust hinders theexhaling of the moisture in the centre and prevents the aircellsfrom cooking</s>  the weight also of the crust pressing down on thedoughy aircells below destroys them producing that horror of goodcooks a heavy streak</s>  the problem in baking then is the quickapplication of heat rather below than above the loaf and its steadycontinuance till all the aircells are thoroughly dried intopermanent consistency</s>  every housewife must watch her own oven toknow how this can be best accomplished</s> breadmaking can be cultivated to any extent as a fine art and thevarious kinds of biscuit tearusks twists rolls into which breadmay be made are much better worth a housekeepers ambition than thegetting up of rich and expensive cake or confections</s>  there are alsovarieties of material which are rich in good effects</s>  unbolted flouraltogether more wholesome than the fine wheat and when properlyprepared more palatable ryeflour and cornmeal each affording athousand attractive possibilitieseach and all of these come underthe general laws of breadstuffs and are worth a careful attention</s> a peculiarity of our american table particularly in the southern andwestern states is the constant exhibition of various preparations ofhot bread</s>  in many families of the south and west bread in loaves tobe eaten cold is an article quite unknown</s>  the effect of this kind ofdiet upon the health has formed a frequent subject of remark amongtravelers but only those know the full mischiefs of it who have beencompelled to sojourn for a length of time in families where it ismaintained</s>  the unknown horrors of dyspepsia from bad bread are atopic over which we willingly draw a veil</s>           next to bread comes butteron which we have to say that when weremember what butter is in civilized europe and compare it with whatit is in america we wonder at the forbearance and lenity of travelersin their strictures on our national commissariat</s> butter in england france and italy is simply solidified cream withall the sweetness of the cream in its taste freshly churned each dayand unadulterated by salt</s>  at the present moment when salt is fivecents a pound and butter fifty we americans are paying i shouldjudge from the taste for about one pound of salt to every ten ofbutter and those of us who have eaten the butter of france andengland do this with rueful recollections</s> there is it is true an article of butter made in the american stylewith salt which in its own kind and way has a merit not inferior tothat of england and france</s>  many prefer it and it certainly takes arank equally respectable with the other</s>  it is yellow hard andworked so perfectly free from every particle of buttermilk that itmight make the voyage of the world without spoiling</s>  it is salted butsalted with care and delicacy so that it may be a question whethereven a fastidious englishman might not prefer its golden solidity tothe white creamy freshness of his own</s>  now i am not for universalimitation of foreign customs and where i find this butter madeperfectly i call it our american style and am not ashamed of it</s>  ionly regret that this article is the exception and not the rule onour tables</s>  when i reflect on the possibilities which beset thedelicate stomach in this line i do not wonder that my veneratedfriend dr</s>  mussey used to close his counsels to invalids with thedirection and dont eat grease on your bread</s> america must i think have the credit of manufacturing and puttinginto market more bad butter than all that is made in all the rest ofthe world together</s>  the varieties of bad tastes and smells whichprevail in it are quite a study</s>  this has a cheesy taste that amouldythis is flavored with cabbage and that again with turnipand another has the strong sharp savor of rancid animal fat</s>  thesevarieties i presume come from the practice of churning only at longintervals and keeping the cream meanwhile in unventilated cellars ordairies the air of which is loaded with the effluvia of vegetablesubstances</s>  no domestic articles are so sympathetic as those of themilk tribe they readily take on the smell and taste of anyneighboring substance and hence the infinite variety of flavors onwhich one mournfully muses who has late in autumn to taste twentyfirkins of butter in hopes of finding one which will simply not beintolerable on his winter table</s> a matter for despair as regards bad butter is that at the tableswhere it is used it stands sentinel at the door to bar your way toevery other kind of food</s>  you turn from your dreadful halfslice ofbread which fills your mouth with bitterness to your beefsteakwhich proves virulent with the same poison you think to take refugein vegetable diet and find the butter in the stringbeans andpolluting the innocence of early peas it is in the corn in thesuccotash in the squash the beets swim

neatlytrimmed muttonchop of an english inn or the artistic little circleof lambchop fried in breadcrumbs coiled around a tempting centre ofspinach which can always be found in france can recognize any familyresemblance to these dapper civilized preparations in those coarseroughly hacked strips of bone gristle and meat which are commonlycalled muttonchop in america</s>  there seems to be a large dish ofsomething resembling meat in which each fragment has about two orthree edible morsels the rest being composed of dry and burnt skinfat and ragged bone</s> is it not time that civilization should learn to demand somewhatmore care and nicety in the modes of preparing what is to be cookedand eaten</s>  might not some of the refinement and trimness whichcharacterize the preparations of the european market be withadvantage introduced into our own</s>  the housekeeper who wishes togarnish her table with some of those nice things is stopped in theoutset by the butcher</s>  except in our large cities where someforeign travel may have created the demand it seems impossible toget much in this line that is properly prepared</s> i am aware that if this is urged on the score of sthetics the readyreply will be oh we cant give time here in america to go intoniceties and french whimwhams</s>  but the french mode of doing almostall practical things is based on that true philosophy and utilitariangood sense which characterize that seemingly thoughtless people</s> nowhere is economy a more careful study and their market isartistically arranged to this end</s>  the rule is so to cut their meatsthat no portion designed to be cooked in a certain manner shall havewasteful appendages which that mode of cooking will spoil</s>  the frenchsoup kettle stands ever ready to receive the bones the thin fibrousflaps the sinewy and gristly portions which are so often included inour roasts or broilings which fill our plates with unsightly dbrisand finally make an amount of blank waste

season the part of alamb denominated leg and loin or hindquarter sold for thirty centsa pound</s>  now this includes besides the thick fleshy portions aquantity of bone sinew and thin fibrous substance constitutingfull one third of the whole weight</s>  if we put it into the oven entirein the usual manner we have the thin parts overdone and the skinnyand fibrous parts utterly dried up by the application of the amountof heat necessary to cook the thick portion</s>  supposing the joint toweigh six pounds at thirty cents and that one third of the weight isso treated as to become perfectly useless we throw away sixty cents</s> of a piece of beef at twentyfive cents a pound fifty cents worth isoften lost in bone fat and burnt skin</s> the fact is this way of selling and cooking meat in large grossportions is of english origin and belongs to a country where all thecustoms of society spring from a class who have no particular occasionfor economy</s>  the practice of minute and delicate division comes from anation which acknowledges the need of economy and has made it astudy</s>  a quarter of lamb in this mode of division would be sold inthree nicely prepared portions</s>  the thick part would be sold byitself for a neat compact little roast the ribbones would beartistically separated and all the edible matters scraped away wouldform those delicate dishes of lambchop

food is wasted in the frenchmodes of preparation even tough animal cartilages and sinews insteadof appearing burnt and blackened in company with the roast meat towhich they happen to be related are treated according to their ownlaws and come out either in savory soups or those fine clearmeatjellies which form a garnish no less agreeable to the eye thanpalatable to the taste</s> whether this careful economical practical style of meat cookingcan ever to any great extent be introduced into our kitchens now is aquestion</s>  our butchers are against it our servants are wedded tothe old wholesale wasteful ways which seem to them easier becausethey are accustomed to them</s>  a cook who will keep and properly tenda soup kettle which shall receive and utilize all that the coarsepreparations of the butcher would require her to trim away whounderstands the art of making the most of all these remains is atreasure scarcely to be hoped for</s>  if such things are to be doneit must be primarily through the educated brain of cultivated womenwho do not scorn to turn their culture and refinement upon domesticproblems</s> when meats have been properly dividedso that each portion canreceive its own appropriate style of treatmentnext comes theconsideration of the modes of cooking</s>  these may be divided into twogreat general classes those where it is desired to keep

indigestible if they aregreasy but french cooks have taught us that a thing has no more needto be greasy because emerging from grease than venus had to be saltbecause she rose from the sea</s> there are two ways of frying employed by the french cook</s>  one is toimmerse the article to be cooked in boiling fat with an emphasis onthe present participleand the philosophical principle is soimmediately to crisp every pore at the first moment or two ofimmersion as effectually to seal the interior against the intrusion ofgreasy particles it can then remain as long as may be necessarythoroughly to cook it without imbibing any more of the boiling fluidthan if it were enclosed in an eggshell</s>  the other method is to rub aperfectly smooth iron surface with just enough of some oily substanceto prevent the meat from adhering and cook it with a quick heat ascakes are baked on a griddle</s>  in both these cases there must be themost rapid application of heat that can be made without burning andby the adroitness shown in working out this problem the skill of thecook is tested</s>  any one whose cook attains this important secret willfind fried things quite as digestible and often more palatable thanany other</s> in the second department of meat cookery to wit the slow and gradualapplication of heat for the softening and dissolution of its fibre andthe extraction of its juices common cooks are equally untrained</s> where is the socalled cook who understands how to prepare soups andstews</s>  these are precisely the articles in which a french kitchenexcels</s>  the soup kettle made with a double bottom to prevent burningis a permanent everpresent institution and the coarsest and mostimpracticable meats distilled through that alembic come

into thenotion that its forte lies in high spicingand so when our cooksput a great abundance of clove mace nutmeg and cinnamon intotheir preparations they fancy that they are growing up to be frenchcooks</s>  but the fact is that the americans and english are farmore given to spicing than the french</s>  spices in our made dishesare abundant and their taste is strongly pronounced</s>  in living ayear in france i forgot the taste of nutmeg clove and allspicewhich had met me in so many dishes in america</s> the thing may be briefly defined</s>  the english and americans deal inspices the french in flavorsflavors many and subtileimitating often in their delicacy those subtile blendings which natureproduces in highflavored fruits</s>  the recipes of our cookerybooks aremost of them of english origin coming down from the times of ourphlegmatic ancestors when the solid burly beefy growth of the foggyisland required the heat of fiery condiments and could digest heavysweets</s>

come into the room without finding theirheads close together over a paper and hearing bob expatiate on hisfavorite idea of a library</s>  he appears to have got so far as thisthat the ceiling is to be

bob declares this will spoil the symmetry of the latterand if there is anything he wants it is a wide generous amplehall to step into when you open the front door</s> well then says marianne lets put two feet more into the widthof the house</s> cant on account of the expense you see says bob</s>  you see everyadditional foot of outside wall necessitates so many more bricks somuch more flooring so

merely to sayin general terms that the first object of a house builder orcontriver should be to make a healthy house and the first requisiteof a healthy house is a pure sweet elastic air</s> i am in favor therefore of those plans of housebuilding which havewide central spaces whether halls or courts into which all the roomsopen and which necessarily preserve a body of fresh air for the useof them

the poisoned air for which there is no escape butthe occasional opening of a door</s> it is no wonder that the first result of all this is such a delicacyof skin and lungs that about half the inmates

mentioned by saint paul asamong those things concerning which no man should judge another</s>  itseems to me that the error as regards the puritan sabbath was inrepresenting it not as a gift from god

twelve oclock of one night and end at twelveoclock of another and from beginning to end the mind must be keptin a state of tension by the effort not to think any of its usualthoughts or do any of its

the feasts and fasts of the oldchurches made of it a thing straiter and stricter than ever the oldjews dreamed of</s> the old jewish sabbath entered only into the physical region merelyenjoining cessation from physical toil</s>  thou shalt not labor nor doany work covered the whole ground</s>  in other respects than this itwas a joyful festival resembling in the mode of keeping it

before the lordtheir god with all their might</s>  we fancy there were no houses wherechildren were afraid to laugh where the voice of social cheerfulnessquavered away in terror lest it should awake a wrathful god</s>  thejewish sabbath was instituted in the absence of printing of booksand of all the advantages of literature to be the great means ofpreserving sacred historya day cleared from all possibility ofother employment than social and family communion when the heads offamilies and the elders of tribes might instruct the young in thosereligious traditions which have thus come down to us</s> the christian sabbath is meant to supply the same moral need in thatimproved and higher state of society which christianity introduced</s> thus it was changed from the day representing the creation of theworld to the resurrection day of him who came to make all things new</s> the jewish sabbath was buried with christ in the sepulchre and arosewith him not a jewish but a christian festival still holding initself that provision for mans needs which the old institutionpossessed but with a wider and more generous freedom of application</s> it was given to the christian world as a day of rest of refreshmentof hope and joy and of worship</s>  the manner of making it such a daywas left open and free to the needs and convenience of the varyingcircumstances and characters of those for whose benefit it wasinstituted</s> well said bob dont you think there is a deal of nonsense aboutsabbathkeeping</s> there is a deal of nonsense about everything human beings have todeal with i said</s> and said marianne how to find out what is nonsense</s> by clear conceptions said i of what the day is for</s>  i shoulddefine the sabbath as a divine and fatherly gift to mana dayexpressly set apart for the cultivation of his moral nature</s>  itsobject is not merely physical rest and recreation but moralimprovement</s>  the former are proper to the day only so far as theyare subservient to the latter</s>  the whole human race have theconscious need of being made better purer and more spiritual thewhole human race have one common danger of sinking to a mere animallife

one day as a special season for the culture of manshighest faculties</s>  accordingly whatever ways and practicesinterfere with the purpose of the sabbath as a day of worship andmoral culture should be avoided and all family arrangements for theday should be made with reference thereto</s> cold dinners on sunday for example said bob</s>  marianne holds theseas prime articles of faith</s> yesthey doubtless are most worthy and merciful in giving to thepoor cook one day she may call her own and rest from the heat ofrange and cookingstove</s>  for the same reason i would suspend as faras possible

more and moreattractive institution</s>  i approve the custom of those who beautify thesabbath schoolroom with plants flowers and pictures thus making itan attractive place to the childish eye</s>  the more this customprevails the more charming in after years will be the memories ofsunday</s> it is most especially to be desired that the whole air and aspect ofthe day should be one of cheerfulness</s>  even the new dresses newbonnets and new shoes in which children delight of a sunday shouldnot be despised</s>  they have their value in marking the day as afestival and it is better for the child to long for sunday for thesake of his little new shoes than that he should hate and dread itas a period of wearisome restraint</s>  all the latitude should be givento children that can be consistently with fixing in their minds theidea of a sacred season</s>  i would rather that the atmosphere of the dayshould resemble that of a weekly thanksgiving than that it should makeits mark

bad onmondayand what is good on monday is good on sunday</s> we cannot abridge other peoples liberty said i</s>  the generousconfiding spirit of christianity has imposed not a single restrictionupon

proper the diversions of light literature andif so let it be used</s>  the mind must have its recreations as well asthe body</s> but for children and young people said my daughterwould you letthem read novels on sunday</s> that is exactly like asking would you let them talk with peopleon sunday</s>  now people are different it depends therefore on whothey are</s>  some are trifling and flighty some are positivelybadprincipled some are altogether good in their influence</s>  so of theclass of books called novels</s>  some are merely frivolous some areabsolutely noxious and dangerous others again are written with astrong moral and religious purpose and being vivid and interestingproduce far more religious effect on the mind than dull treatisesand sermons</s>  the parables of christ sufficiently establish the pointthat there is no inherent objection to the use of fiction inteaching religious truth</s>  good religious fiction thoughtfullyread may be quite as profitable as any other reading</s> but dont you think said marianne that there is danger in toomuch fiction</s> yes said i</s>  but the chief danger of all that class of reading isits easiness and the indolent careless mental habits it induces</s>  agreat deal of the reading of young people on all days is reallyreading to no purpose its object being merely present amusement</s>  itis a listless yielding of the mind to be washed over by a stream whichleaves no fertilizing properties and carries away by constant wearthe good soil of thought</s>  i should try to establish a barrier againstthis kind of reading not only on sunday but on monday on tuesdayand on all days</s>  instead therefore of objecting to any particularclass of books for sunday reading i should say in general thatreading merely for pastime without any moral aim is the thing to beguarded against</s>  that which inspires no thought no purpose whichsteals away all our strength and energy and makes the sabbath a dayof dreams is the reading i would object to</s> so of music</s>  i do not see the propriety of confining ones self totechnical sacred music</s>  any grave solemn thoughtful or patheticmusic has a proper relation to our higher spiritual nature whether itbe printed in a church servicebook or on secular sheets</s>  on me forexample beethovens sonatas have a far more deeply religiousinfluence than much that has religious names and words</s>  music is to bejudged of by its effects</s> well said bob if sunday is given for our own individualimprovement i for one should not go to church</s>  i think i get a greatdeal more good in staying at home and reading</s> there are two considerations to be taken into account in reference tothis matter of churchgoing i replied</s>  one relates to our duty asmembers of society in keeping up the influence of the sabbath andcausing it to be respected in the community the other to the properdisposition of our time for our own moral improvement</s>  as members ofthe community we should go to church and do all in our power tosupport the outward ordinances of religion</s>  if a conscientious manmakes up his mind that sunday is a day for outward acts of worship andreverence he should do his own part as an individual towardssustaining these observances</s>  even though he may have such mental andmoral resources that as an individual he could gain much more insolitude than in a congregation still he owes to the congregation theinfluence of his presence and sympathy</s>  but i have never yet seen theman however finely gifted morally and intellectually whom i thoughtin the long run a gainer in either of these respects by the neglect ofpublic worship</s>  i have seen many who in their pride kept aloof fromthe sympathies and communion of their brethren who lost strengthmorally and deteriorated in ways that made themselves painfully felt</s> sunday is apt in such cases to degenerate into a day of mere mentalidleness and reverie or to become a sort of wastepaper box forscraps odds and ends of secular affairs</s> as to those very good peopleand many such there arewho gostraight on with the work of life on sunday on the plea that tolabor is to pray i simply think they are mistaken</s>  in the firstplace to labor is not the same thing as to pray</s>  it may sometimesbe as good a thing to do and in some cases even a better thing butit is not the same thing</s>  a man might as well never write a letter tohis wife on the plea that making money for her is writing to her</s> it may possibly be quite as great a proof of love to work for a wifeas to write to her but few wives would not say that both were notbetter than either alone</s>  furthermore there is no doubt that theintervention of one day of spiritual rest and aspiration so refreshesa mans whole nature and oils the many wheels of existence thathe who allows himself a weekly sabbath does more work in the courseof his life for the omission of work on that day</s> a young student in a french college where the examinations arerigidly severe found by experience that he succeeded best in hisexamination by allowing one day of entire rest just before it</s>  hisbrain and nervous system refreshed in this way carried him through thework better than if taxed to the last moment</s>  there are mentransacting a large and complicated business who can testify to thesame influence from the repose of the sabbath</s> i believe those christian people who from conscience and principleturn their thoughts most entirely out of the current of worldly careson sunday fulfill unconsciously a great law of health and thatwhether their moral nature be thereby advanced or not their brainwill work more healthfully and actively for it even in physical andworldly matters</s>  it is because the sabbath thus harmonizes thephysical and moral laws of our being that the injunction concerning itis placed among the ten great commandments each of which representssome one of the immutable needs of humanity</s> there is yet another point of family religion that ought to bethought of said my wife i mean the customs of mourning</s>  if thereis anything that ought to distinguish christian families from pagansit should be their way of looking at and meeting those inevitableevents that must from time to time break the family chain</s>  it seems tobe the peculiarity of christianity to shed hope on such events</s>  andyet it seems to me as if it were the very intention of many of thecustoms of society to add tenfold to their gloom and horrorsuchswathings of black crape such funereal mufflings of every pleasantobject such darkening of rooms and such seclusion from society andgiving up to bitter thoughts and lamentation</s>  how can little childrenthat look on such things believe that there is a particle of truth inall they hear about the joyous and comforting doctrines which thebible holds forth for such times</s> that subject is a difficult one i rejoined</s>  nature seems toindicate a propriety in some outward expressions of grief when we loseour friends</s>  all nations agree in these demonstrations</s>  in a certaindegree they are soothing

its uses are more for the first few months of sorrow when itserves the mourner as a safeguard from intrusion insuring quiet andleisure in which to reunite the broken threads of life and to gatherstrength for a return to its duties</s>  but to wear mourning garments andforego society for two or three years after the loss of any friendhowever dear i cannot but regard as a morbid unhealthy nursing ofsorrow unworthy of a christian</s> and yet said my wife to such an unhealthy degree does this customprevail that i have actually known young girls who have never wornany other dress than mourning and consequently never been intosociety during the entire period of their girlhood</s>  first the deathof a father necessitated three years of funereal garments andabandonment of social

american woman who would come into ourfamily and take that place but i know its perfectly vain and uselessto expect it</s>  you know we have tried the experiment two or three timesof having a person in our family who should be on the footing of afriend yet do the duties of a servant and that we never could makeit work well</s>  these halfandhalf people are so sensitive so exactingin their demands so hard to please that we have come to the firmdetermination that we will have no slidingscale in our family andthat whoever we are to depend on must come with bona fide willingnessto take the position of a servant such as that position is in ourhouse and that i suppose your protge would never do even if shecould thereby live easier have less hard work better health andquite as much money as she could earn in any other way</s> she would consider it a personal degradation i suppose said mywife</s> and yet if she only knew it said bob i should respect her farmore profoundly for her willingness to take that position whenadverse fortune has shut other doors</s> well now said i this woman is as i understand the daughter ofa respectable stonemason and the domestic habits of her early lifehave probably been economical and simple</s>  like most of our mechanicsdaughters she has received in one of our high schools an educationwhich has cultivated and developed her mind far beyond those of herparents and the associates of her childhood</s>  this is a common fact inour american life</s>  by our high schools the daughters of plainworkingmen are raised to a state of

to herself warm affection and yet thiscalling is the one always refused shunned contemned left to thealien and the stranger and that simply and solely because it bearsthe name of servant</s>  a christian woman who holds the name of christin her heart in true devotion would think it the greatest possiblemisfortune and degradation to become like him in taking upon her theform of a servant</s>  the founder of christianity says whether isgreater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth</s>  but i am amongyou as he that serveth</s>  but notwithstanding these so plaindeclarations of jesus we find that scarce any one in a christian landwill accept real advantages of position and employment that come withthat name and condition</s> i suppose said my wife i could prevail upon this woman to do allthe duties of the situation if she could be as they phrase ittreated as one of the family</s> that is to say said bob if she could sit with us at the sametable be introduced to our friends and be in all respects as oneof us</s>  now as to this i am free to say that i have no falsearistocratic scruples</s>  i consider every welleducated woman as fullymy equal not to say my superior but it

unreserve to speak ofmatters that concern ourselves and our family alone</s>  even invitedguests and family friends would not be always welcome howeveragreeable at times</s>  now a woman may be perfectly worthy of respectand we may be perfectly respectful to her whom nevertheless we donot wish to take into the circle of intimate friendship</s>  i regardthe position of a woman who comes to perform domestic service as ido any other business relation</s>  we have a very respectable young ladyin our employ who does legal copying for us and all is perfectlypleasant and agreeable in our mutual relations but the case would befar otherwise were she to take it into her head that we treated herwith contempt because my wife did not call on her and because shewas not occasionally invited to tea</s>  besides i apprehend that awoman of quick sensibilities employed in domestic service and whowas so far treated as a member of the family as to share our tablewould find her position even more painful and embarrassing than ifshe took once for all the position of a servant</s>  we could notcontrol the feelings of our friends we could not always insurethat they would be free from aristocratic prejudice even were we soourselves</s>  we could not force her upon their acquaintance and shemight feel far more slighted than she would in a position where noattentions of any kind were to be expected</s>  besides which i havealways noticed that persons standing in this uncertain position areobjects of peculiar antipathy to the servants in full that theyare the cause of constant and secret cabals and discontents and thata family where the two orders exist has always raked up in it thesmouldering embers of a quarrel ready at any time to burst outinto open feud</s> well said i here lies the problem of american life</s>  half ourwomen like marianne are being faded and made old before their timeby exhausting endeavors to lead a life of high civilization andrefinement with only such untrained help as is washed up on our shoresby the tide of emigration</s>  our houses are built upon a plan thatprecludes the necessity of much hard labor but requires rathercareful and nice handling</s>  a welltrained intelligent woman who hadvitalized her fingerends by means of a welldeveloped brain could doall the work of such a house with comparatively little physicalfatigue</s>  so stands the case as regards our houses</s>  now over againstthe women that are perishing in them from too much care there isanother class of american women that are wandering up and downperishing for

development ofchristian democracy</s>  the taint of old aristocracies is yet pervadingall parts of our society</s>  we have not yet realized fully the truedignity of labor and the surpassing dignity of domestic labor</s>  and imust say that the valuable and courageous women who have agitated thedoctrines of womans rights among us have not in all things seen theirway clear in this matter</s> dont

 they have already in manyof our states reformed the laws relating to womans position andplaced her on a more just and christian basis</s>  it is through theirmovements that in many of our states a woman can hold the fruits ofher own earnings if it be her ill luck to have a worthless drunkenspendthrift for a husband</s>  it is owing to their exertions that newtrades and professions are opening to woman and all that i have tosay to them is that in the suddenness of their zeal for opening newpaths for her feet they have not sufficiently considered thepropriety of straightening widening and mending the one broad goodold path of domestic labor established by god himself</s>  it does appearto me that if at least a portion of their zeal could be spent inremoving the stones out of this highway of domestic life and makingit pleasant and honorable they would effect even more</s>  i would nothave them leave undone what they are doing but i would were i worthyto be considered humbly suggest to their prophetic wisdom andenthusiasm whether in this new future of women which they wish tointroduce womens natural godgiven employment of domestic serviceis not to receive a new character

dishonored among us professingchristians that good women will beg or starve will suffer almost anyextreme of poverty and privation rather than accept home competencesecurity with this honored name</s> the fault with many of our friends of the womans rights order saidmy wife is the depreciatory tone in which they have spoken of thedomestic labors of a family as being altogether below the scope ofthe

duties of menand women and children</s>  we all hear of our rights till we forget ourduties and even theology is beginning to concern itself more withwhat man has a right to expect of his creator than what the creatorhas a right to expect of man</s> you say the truth said i there is danger of just this overactionand yet rights must be discussed because in order to understand theduties we owe to any

success of our great democratic experiment is overthrown andthere seems no limit to the splendid possibilities which it may openbefore the human race</s> in the reconstruction that is now coming there lies more than thereconstruction of states and the arrangement of the machinery ofgovernment</s>  we need to know and feel all of us that from the momentof the death of slavery we parted finally from the rgime and controlof all the old ideas formed under old oppressive systems of societyand came upon a new plane of life</s> in this new life we must never forget that we are a peculiar peoplethat we have to walk in paths unknown to the old worldpaths whereits wisdom cannot guide us where its precedents can be of little useto us and its criticisms in most cases must be wholly irrelevant</s> the history of our war has shown us of how little service to us in anyimportant crisis the opinions and advice of the old world can be</s>  wehave been hurt at what seemed to us the want of sympathy the directantagonism of england</s>  we might have been less hurt if we hadproperly understood that providence had placed us in a position so farahead of her ideas or power of comprehension that just judgment orsympathy was not to be expected from her</s> as we went through our great war with no help but that of godobliged to disregard the misconceptions and impertinences which theforeign press rained down upon us so if we are wise we shallcontinue to do</s>  our object must now be to make the principles on whichour government is founded permeate consistently the mass of societyand to purge out the leaven of aristocratic and old world ideas</s>  solong as there is an illogical working in our actual life so long asthere is any class denied equal rights with other classes so longwill there be agitation and trouble</s> then said my wife you believe that women ought to vote</s> if the principle on which we founded our government is true thattaxation must not exist without representation and if women holdproperty and are taxed it follows that women should be represented inthe state by their votes or there is an illogical working of ourgovernment</s> but my dear dont you think that this will have a bad effect on thefemale character</s> yes said bob it will make women caucus holders politicalcandidates</s> it may make this of some women just as of some men said i</s>  butall men do not take any great interest in politics it is verydifficult to get some of the best of them to do their duty in votingand the same will be found true among women</s> but after all said bob what do you gain</s>  what will a womansvote be but a duplicate of that of her husband or father or whateverman happens to be her adviser</s> that may be true on a variety of questions but there are subjectson which the vote of women would i think be essentially differentfrom that of men</s>  on the subjects of temperance public morals andeducation i have no doubt that the introduction of the female voteinto legislation in states counties and cities would produceresults very different from that of men alone</s>  there are thousands ofwomen who would close grogshops and stop the traffic in

family</s> imagine a family where the female has no voice in the housekeeping</s>  astate is but a larger family and there are many of its concernswhich equally with those of a private household would be betteredby female supervision</s> but fancy women going to those horrible votingplaces</s>  it is morethan i can do myself said bob</s> but you forget said i that they are horrible and disgustingprincipally because women never go to them</s>  all places where women areexcluded tend downward to barbarism but the moment she is introducedthere come in with her courtesy cleanliness sobriety and order</s> when a man can walk up to the ballotbox with his wife or his sisteron his arm votingplaces will be far more agreeable than now andthe polls will not be such beargardens that refined men will beconstantly tempted to omit their political duties there</s> if for nothing else i would have women vote that the business ofvoting may not be so disagreeable and intolerable to men of refinementas it now is and i sincerely believe that the cause of good moralsgood order cleanliness and public health would be a gainer notmerely by the added feminine vote but by the added vote of a greatmany excellent but too fastidious men who are now kept from the pollsby the disagreeables they meet there</s> do you suppose that if women had equal representation with men inthe municipal laws

brought in a dispensation of brooms and whitewash and madea terrible searching into dark holes and vile corners before now</s> female new york i have faith to believe has yet left in her enoughof the primary instincts of womanhood to give us a clean healthycity if female votes had any power to do it</s> but said bob you forget that voting would bring together all thewomen of the lower classes</s> yes but thanks to the instincts of their sex they would come intheir sunday clothes for where is the woman that hasnt her fineryand will not embrace every chance to show it</s>  biddys parasol and hatwith pink ribbons would necessitate a clean shirt in pat as much ason sunday</s>  voting would become a fte and we should have a populationat the polls as welldressed as at church</s>  such is my belief</s> i do not see said bob but you go to the full extent with ourmodern female reformers</s> there are certain neglected truths which have been held up by thesereformers that are gradually being accepted and infused into the lifeof modern society and their recognition will help to solidify andpurify democratic institutions</s>  they are1</s>  the right of every woman to hold independent property</s> 2</s>  the right of every woman to receive equal pay with man for workwhich she does equally well</s> 3</s>  the right of any woman to do any work for which by her naturalorganization and talent she is peculiarly adapted</s> under the first head our energetic sisters have already by the helpof their gallant male adjutants reformed the laws of several of ourstates so that a married woman is no longer left the unprotectedlegal slave of any unprincipled drunken spendthrift who may be herhusbandbut in case of the imbecility or improvidence of thenatural head of the family the wife if she have the ability canconduct business make contracts earn and retain money for the goodof the household and i am sure no one can say that immense injusticeand cruelty are not thereby prevented</s> it is quite easy for women who have the good fortune to have just andmagnanimous husbands to say that they feel no interest in suchreforms and that they would willingly trust their property to the manto whom they give themselves but they should remember that laws arenot made for the restraint of the generous and just but of thedishonest and base</s>  the law which enables a married woman to hold herown property does not forbid her to give it to the man of her heartif she so pleases and it does protect many women who otherwise wouldbe reduced to the extremest misery</s>  i once knew an energetic millinerwho had her shop attached four times and a flourishing businessbroken up in four different cities because she was tracked from cityto city by a worthless spendthrift who only waited till she hadamassed a little property in a new place to swoop down upon and carryit off</s>  it is to be hoped that the time is not distant when everystate will give to woman a fair chance to the ownership and use of herown earnings and her own property</s> under the head of the right of every woman to do any work for whichby natural organization and talent she is especially adapted there isa word or two to be said</s> the talents and tastes of the majority of women are naturallydomestic</s>  the family is evidently their sphere because in all waystheir organization fits them for that more than for anything else</s> but there are occasionally women who are exceptions to the commonlaw gifted with peculiar genius and adaptations</s>  with regard to suchwomen there has

shown a fair average of good sense in thismatter from the days of the fair hypatia in alexandria who we aretold gave lectures on philosophy behind a curtain lest her charmsshould distract the attention of too impressible young men down tothose of anna dickinson</s>  mankind are not after all quite fools andseem in these cases to have a reasonable idea that exceptional talentshave exceptional laws and make their own code of proprieties</s> now there is no doubt that miss dickinson though as relating to herfemininity she is quite as pretty and modest a young woman as any tobe found in the most sheltered circle has yet a most exceptionaltalent for public speaking which draws crowds to hear her and makeslecturing for her a lucrative profession as well as a means ofadvocating

questions of our age</s>  the war hasdeprived so many thousands of women of their natural protectors thateverything must be thought of that may possibly open a way for theirselfsupport</s> well let us

greatly obliged to miss blackwell andother noble pioneers who faced and overcame the obstacles to theattainment of a thorough medical education by females</s>  thanks to thema new and lucrative

irishlabor began to come in simultaneously with a great advance in femaleeducation</s> for a long while nothing was talked of written of thought of inteachers meetings conventions and assemblies but

the stateand to public life they may have but the public duties of women mustbear to their family ones the same relation that the family duties ofmen bear to their public ones</s>  the defect in the late efforts to pushon female education is that it has been for her merely general andthat it has left out and excluded all that is professional and sheundertakes the essential duties of womanhood

once it was thought impossible in school toteach girls geometry or algebra or the higher mathematics it wasthought impossible to put them through collegiate courses but it hasbeen done and we see

many women in the home life that we should not beobliged to send our women out to california or the pacific to put anend to an anxious and aimless life</s> when domestic work is sufficiently honored to be taught as an art andscience in our boardingschools and highschools then possibly it mayacquire also dignity in the eyes of our working classes and younggirls who have to earn their own living

christopher crowfieldapplying so harshly and as we think so indiscriminatingly the theoryof work to women and teaching a society made up of women sacrificedin the workshops of the state or to the

housekeeper and knows perfectly all that pertains to the care of a family but she has three little children and a delicate babe only a few weeks old and can any one woman do all that is needed for such a household</s>  something must be trusted to servants and what is thus trusted brings such confusion and waste and dirt into our house that the poor woman is constantly distraught between the disgust of having them and the utter impossibility of doing without them</s>  now it has been suggested that we remedy the trouble by paying higher wages but i find that for the very highest wages i secure only the most miserable service and yet poor as it is we are obliged to put up with it because there is an amount of work to be done in our family that is absolutely beyond my wifes strength</s>  i see her health wearing away under these trials her life made a burden i feel no power to help her and i ask you mr</s>  crowfield what are we to do</s>  what is to become of family life in this country</s>  yours truly a young family man</s> my friends letter said i touches upon the very hinge of thedifficulty of domestic life with the present generation</s> the real vital difficulty after all in our american life is thatour country is so wide so various so abounding in the richest fieldsof enterprise that in every direction the cry is of the plenteousnessof the harvest and the fewness of the laborers</s>  in short there reallyare not laborers enough to do the work of the country</s> since the war has thrown the whole south open to the competitionof free labor the demand for workers is doubled and trebled</s> manufactories of all sorts are enlarging their borders increasingtheir machinery and calling for more hands</s>  every article ofliving is demanded with an imperativeness and over an extent ofterritory which set at once additional thousands to the task ofproduction</s>  instead of being easier to find hands to execute in allbranches of useful labor it is likely to grow every year moredifficult as new departments of manufacture and trade divide theworkers</s>  the price of labor even now higher in this country thanin any other will rise still higher and thus complicate still morethe problem of domestic life</s>  even if a reasonable quota ofintelligent women choose domestic service the demand will beincreasingly beyond the supply</s> and what have you to say to this said my wife seeing you cannotstop the prosperity of the country</s> simply thisthat communities will be driven to organize as theynow do in europe to lessen the labors of individual families byhaving some of the present domestic tasks done out of the house</s> in france for example no housekeeper counts either washingironing or breadmaking as part of her domestic cares</s>  all the familywashing goes out to a laundry and being attended to by those who makethat department of labor a specialty it comes home in refreshinglybeautiful order</s> we in america though we pride ourselves on our yankee thrift arefar behind the french in domestic economy</s>  if all the families of aneighborhood should put together the sums they separately spend inbuying or fitting up and keeping in repair tubs boilers and otheraccommodations for washing all that is consumed or wasted in soapstarch bluing fuel together with the wages and board of an extraservant the aggregate would suffice to fit up a neighborhood laundrywhere one or two capable women could do easily and well what ten orfifteen women now do painfully and ill and to the confusion andderangement of all other family processes</s> the model laundries for the poor in london had facilities which wouldenable a woman to do both the washing and ironing of a small family infrom two to three hours and were so arranged that a very few womencould with ease do the work of a neighborhood</s> but in the absence of an establishment of this sort the housekeepersof a country village might help themselves very much by owning amangle in common to which all the heavier parts of the ironing couldbe sent</s>  american ingenuity has greatly improved the machinery of themangle</s>  it is no longer the heavy cumbersome

massachusetts now manufactures thesearticles and sends them to all parts of the country</s>  the smallest ofthem does not take up much more room than a sewingmachine can beturned by a boy of ten or twelve and thus in the course of an hour ortwo the heaviest and most fatiguing part of a family ironing may beaccomplished</s> i should certainly advise the young family man with a delicate wifeand uncertain domestic help to fortify his kitchen with one of thesefixtures</s> but after all i still say that the quarter to which i look for thesolution of the american problem of domestic life is a wise use of theprinciple of association</s> the future model village of new england as i see it shall have forthe use of its inhabitants not merely a town lyceum hall and a townlibrary but a town laundry fitted up with conveniences such as noprivate house can afford and paying a price to the operators whichwill enable them to command an excellence of work such as privatefamilies seldom realize</s>  it will also have a town bakery where thebest of family bread white brown and of all grains shall becompounded and lastly a town cookshop where soup and meats may bebought ready for the table</s>  those of us who have kept house abroadremember the ease with which our foreign establishments were carriedon</s>  a suite of elegant apartments a courier and one female servantwere the foundation of domestic life</s>  our courier boarded us at amoderate expense and the servant took care of our rooms</s>  punctuallyat the dinner hour every day our dinner came in on the head of aporter from a neighboring cookshop</s>  a large chest lined with tin andkept warm by a tiny charcoal stove in the centre being deposited inan anteroom from it came forth first soup then fish then roasts ofvarious names and lastly pastry and confectionsfar more coursesthan any reasonable christian needs to keep him in healthy conditionand dinner being over our box with its dbris went out of the houseleaving a clear field</s> now i put it to the distressed young family man whether these threeinstitutions of a bakery a cookshop and a laundry in the villagewhere he lives would not virtually annihilate his household caresand restore peace and comfort to his now distracted family</s> there really is no more reason why every family should make its ownbread than its own butterwhy every family should do its own washingand ironing than its own tailoring or mantuamaking</s>  in france wherecertainly the arts of economy are well studied there is somespecialty for many domestic needs for which we keep servants</s>  thebeautiful inlaid floors are kept waxed and glossy by a professionalgentleman who wears a brush on his footsole skates gracefully overthe surface and leaving all right

domestic life is sowearing and so oppressive as seriously to affect health and happiness</s> whatever has been done abroad in the way of comfort and conveniencecan be done here and the first neighborhood that shall set theexample of dividing the tasks and burdens of life by the judicious useof the principle of association will initiate a most important step inthe way of national happiness and prosperity</s> my solution then of the domestic problem may be formulized asfollows1st</s>  that women make self helpfulness and family helpfulnessfashionable and every woman use her muscles daily in enough householdwork to give her a good digestion</s> 2d</s>  that the situation of a domestic be made so respectable andrespected that welleducated american women shall be induced to takeit as a trainingschool for their future family life</s> 3d</s>  that families by association lighten the multifarious labors ofthe domestic sphere</s> all of which i humbly submit to the good sense and

rules france</s>  said pheasant</s>  who decides what the fashionsshall be there</s> it is the great misfortune of the civilized world at the presenthour said i that the state of morals in france is apparently atthe very lowest ebb and consequently the leadership of fashion isentirely in the hands of a class of women who could not be admittedinto good society in any country</s>  women who can never have the nameof wifewho know none of the ties of familythese are thedictators whose dress and equipage and appointments give the lawfirst to france and through france to the civilized world</s>  such wasthe confession of monsieur dupin made in a late speech before thefrench senate and acknowledged with murmurs of assent on all sidesto be the truth</s>  this is the reason why the fashions have

fashion is gettingto be a morbid unhealthy epidemic which really eats away thenobleness and purity of women</s> in france as monsieur dupin edmond about and michelet tell us theextravagant demands of love for dress lead women to contract debtsunknown to their husbands and sign obligations which are paid by thesacrifice of honor and thus the purity of the family is continuallyundermined</s>  in

us feel our way</s>  in the first place then we areall agreed in one startingpointthat beauty is not to be consideredas a bad thingthat the love of ornament in our outward and physicallife is not a sinful or a dangerous feeling and only leads to evilas all other innocent things do by being used in wrong ways</s>  so farwe are all agreed are we not</s> certainly said all the voices</s> it is

poetical nature that is given by the love of flowers andof natural objects</s> in the third place there is nothing in itself wrong or unworthy arational being in a certain degree of attention to the fashion ofsociety in our costume</s>  it is not wrong to be annoyed at unnecessarydepartures from the commonly received practices of good society in thematter of the arrangement of our toilet and it

in the works of plato</s> the apostle gives no rule no specific costume which should mark thechristian woman from the pagan but says whose adorning let it notbe that outward adorning of plaiting the

driving strikes us as outrin a parlor and a parlor dress would no less shock our eyes onhorseback</s>  in short the course of this principle through allvarieties of form can easily be perceived</s>  besides appropriatenessto time place and circumstances there is appropriateness to ageposition and character</s>  this is the foundation of all our ideas ofprofessional propriety in costume</s>  one would not like to see aclergyman in his external air and appointments resembling agentleman of the turf one would not wish a refined and modest scholarto wear the outward air of a fast fellow or an

which shewears them are simply ridiculous when transferred to the toilet ofher serious wellmeaning mamma who bears them about with ananxious face merely because a loquacious milliner has assured herwith many protestations that it is the fashion and the only thingremaining for her to do</s> there are again modes of dress in themselves very beautifuland very striking which are peculiarly adapted to theatricalrepresentation and to pictures but the adoption of which as apart of unprofessional toilet produces a sense of incongruity</s>  amode of dress maybe in perfect taste on the stage

the toiletsthere displayed might have been in good keeping among showy parisianwomen in an opera house but even their original inventors would havebeen shocked at the idea of carrying them into a

form a subject for such a court of inquiry andadaptation as we have supposed to draw a line between the costume ofthe theatre and the church</s> in the same manner there is a want of appropriateness

the same ruleholds good in dress</s>  as in every apartment so in every toilet thereshould be one groundtone or dominant color which should rule all theothers and there should be a general style of

than they do in their ordinary apparel a comparativelyplain person looks almost handsome in simple black</s>  now why is this</s> simply because mourning requires a severe uniformity of color andidea

very similar results have been attained by the quaker costume whichin spite of the quaint severity of the forms to which it adhered hasalways had a remarkable degree of becomingness because of itsrestriction to a few simple colors and to the absence of distractingornament</s> but the same effect which is produced in mourning or the quakercostume may be preserved in a style of dress admitting color andornamentation</s>  a dress may have the richest fullness of colorand still the tints may be so chastened and subdued as to producethe impression of a severe simplicity</s>  suppose

leaders of society have blunted their finer perceptions bydissipation and immorality they are incapable of feeling the beautieswhich come from delicate concords and truly artistic combinations</s> they verge towards barbarism and require things that are strangeodd dazzling and peculiar to captivate their jaded senses</s>  such wetake to be the condition of parisian society now</s>  the tone of

effort to play the ladyher dress was in homely plainness a perfect contrast to that of thegirls who had preceded her</s>  it consisted of strong darkblue stuffmade perfectly plain to her figure with a narrow band of white linenaround her throat</s>  her dark brown hair was brushed smoothly away fromher face and confined simply behind in a net there was not theslightest pretension to coquetry in its arrangement in fact theobject seemed to be to get it snugly out of the way rather than tomake it a matter of ornament</s>  nevertheless i could not help remarkingthat there was a good deal of it and that it waved very prettilynotwithstanding the care that had been taken to brush the curl out ofit</s> she was apparently about twenty years of age</s>  her face was nothandsome but it was a refined and intelligent one</s>  the skin had asallow hue which told of ill health or of misfortune there werelines of trouble about the eye but the mouth and chin had thatunmistakable look of firmness which

gray eyes attentive and thoughtfuland she met the look of any one who addressed her with an honestfirmness she seemed to be in fact simply and only interested toknow and to do the work she had undertakenbut what there might bebehind and beyond that i could not conjecture</s> one thing about her dress most in contrast with that of the otherservants was that she evidently wore no crinoline</s>  the exuberance ofthis article in the toilet of our domestics had become threatening oflate apparently requiring that the kitchens and pantries should betorn down and rebuilt</s>  as matters were our three girls never couldbe in our kitchen at one time without reefings and manoeuvrings oftheir apparel which much impeded any other labor and caused some lossof temper and our chinacloset was altogether too small for theofficials who had to wash the china there and they were constantly atodds with my mother for her firmness in resisting their tendency tocarry our china and silver to the general mle of the kitchen sink</s> moreover our diningroom not having been constructed with an eye tomodern expansions of the female toilet it happened that if our tablewas to be enlarged for guests there arose serious questions of thewaiters crinoline to complicate the calculations and for all thesereasons i was inclined to look with increasing wonder on a being infemale form

disposed families is often extended as an invitation to aservant to talk a little with an employer mary met it with thebriefest and gravest response that was compatible with propriety andwith a definite and marked respectfulness of demeanor which hadprecisely the effect of throwing us all at a distance likeceremonious politeness in the intercourse of good society</s> i cannot make out our

perfect consideration and politeness talks with them duringthe times that they necessarily are thrown together in the mostaffable and cheerful manner and never assumes any airs of supremacywith them</s>  her wanting a room to herself gave them at first an ideathat she would hold herself aloof from them and in fact for thefirst few days there was a subterranean fire in the kitchen ready toburst forth but now all that is past and in some way or otherwithout being in the least like any of them she has contrived to makethem her fast friends</s>  i found her last night in the kitchen writing aletter for the cook and the other day she was sitting in her roomtrimming a bonnet for katy and her opinion seems to be law in thekitchen</s>  she seldom sits there and spends most of her

little places in the domestic arrangement where a handor an eye was needed</s>  she was deft at mending glass and china andequally so at mending all sorts of household things</s>  she darned thenapkins and tablecloths in a way that excited my mothers admirationand was always so obliging and ready to offer her services that intime a resort to marys workbasket and ever ready needle became themost natural thing in the world to all of us</s>  she seemed to have noacquaintance in the city never went out visiting received nolettersin short seemed to live a completely isolated life and todwell in her own thoughts in her own solitary little room</s> by that talent for systematic arrangement which she possessed shesecured for herself a good many hours to spend there</s>  my motherseeing her taste for reading offered her the use of our books andone volume after another spent its quiet week or fortnight in herroom and returned to our shelves in due time</s>  they were

does more than any other girl ever did beforein her place and is so trustworthy that she is invaluable to us</s> persons of her class are worth higher wages than common uneducatedservants</s> my mother accordingly did make a handsome addition to marys wagesand by the time she had been with us a year the confidence which herquiet manner had inspired was such that if my mother wished to begone for a day or two the house with all that was in it was lefttrustingly in marys hands as with a sort of housekeeper</s>  she wascharged with all the last directions as well as the keys to thejellies cakes and preserves with discretionary power as to theiruse and yet for some reason such was the ascendency she contrivedto keep over her hibernian friends in the kitchen all this confidenceevidently

goodpoor soul</s> matters thus went on and i amused myself now and then withspeculating about mary</s>  i would sometimes go to her to ask some ofthose little charities of the needle which our sex are always needingfrom feminine hands but never in the course of any of these littletransactions could i establish the slightest degree of confidentialcommunication</s>  if she sewed on a shirtbutton she did it with asabstracted an air as if my arm were a post which she was required tohandle and not the arm of a goodlooking youth of twentyfiveas ifondly hoped i was</s>  and certain remarks which i once addressed to herin regard to her studies and reading in her own apartment were metwith that cool wideopen gaze of her calm gray eyes that seemed tosay pray what is that to your purpose sir</s>  and she merelyanswered is there anything else that you would like me to do sir</s> with a marked deference that was really defiant</s> but one day i fancied i had got hold of a clue</s>  i was standing in ourlower front hall when i saw young mcpherson whom i used to know innew york coming up the doorsteps</s> at the moment that he rung the doorbell our mary who had seen himfrom the chamber window suddenly grew pale and said to my motherplease maam will you be so good as to excuse my going to the door</s> i feel faint</s> my mother spoke over the banisters and i opened the door and let inmcpherson</s> he and i were jolly together as old classmates are wont to be andorders were given to lay a plate for him at dinner</s> mary prepared the service with her usual skill and care but pleadedthat her illness increased so that it would be impossible for her towait on table</s>  now nobody in the house thought there was anythingpeculiar about this but myself</s>  my mother indeed had noticed thatmarys faintness had come on very suddenly as she looked out on thestreet but it was i who suggested to her that mcpherson might havesome connection with it</s> depend upon it mother he is somebody whom she has known in herformer life and doesnt wish to meet said i</s> nonsense tom you are always getting up mysteries and fancyingromances</s> nevertheless i took a vicious pleasure in experimenting on thesubject and therefore a day or two after when i had got mary fairlywithin eyerange as she waited on table i remarked to my mothercarelessly by the bye the mcphersons are coming to boston tolive</s> there was a momentary jerk of marys hand as she was filling atumbler and then i could see the restraint of selfcommand passingall over her</s>  i had hit something i knew so i pursued my game</s> yes i continued jim is here to look at houses he is thinkingstrongly of one in the next block</s> there was a look of repressed fear and distress on marys face as shehastily turned away and made an errand into the chinacloset</s> i have found a clue i said to my mother triumphantly going toher room after dinner</s>  did you notice marys agitation when i spokeof the mcphersons coming to boston</s>  by jove</s>  but the girl isplucky though it was the least little start and in a minute shehad her visor down and her armor buckled</s>  this certainly becomesinteresting</s> tom i certainly must ask you what business it is of yours said mymother settling back into the hortatory attitude familiar to mothers</s> supposing the thing is as you thinksuppose that mary is a girl

yourrestlessness about this should be the means of marys leaving us</s>  youknow the perfectly dreadful times we had before she came and i dontknow anybody who has less patience to bear such things than you</s> in short my mother was in that positive state of mind which isexpressed by the colloquial phrase of being on her high horse</s>  iasthe male part of creation always must in such casesbecame very meekand retiring and promised to close my eyes and ears and not dreamor think or want to know anything which it was not agreeable to maryand my mother that i should</s>  i would not look towards the doorbellnor utter a word about the mcphersons who by the bye decided totake the house in our neighborhood</s> but though i was as exemplary as one of the saints it did no good</s> mary for some reasons known to herself became fidgety nervousrestless and had frequent headaches and long crying spells in her ownprivate apartment after the manner of women when something is thematter with them</s> my mother was as she always is with every creature in her employmaternal and sympathetic and tried her very best to get into herconfidence</s> mary only confessed to feeling a little unwell and hinted obscurelythat perhaps she should be obliged to leave the place</s>  but it wasquite evident that her leaving was connected with the near advent ofthe mcphersons in the next block for i observed that she alwaysshowed some little irrepressible signs of nervousness whenever thatsubject was incidentally alluded to</s>  finally on the day that theirfurniture began to arrive and to provide abundant material for gossipand comment to the other members of the kitchen cabinet marys mindappeared suddenly made up</s>  she came into my mothers room looking as acertain sort of women do when they have made a resolution which theymean to stand byvery pale very quiet and very decided</s>  she askedto see my mother alone and in that interview she simply expressedgratitude for all her kindness to her but said that circumstanceswould oblige her to go to new york</s> my mother now tried her best to draw from her her history whateverthat might be</s>  she spoke with tact and tenderness and with therespect due from one human being to another for my mother always heldthat every soul has its own inviolable private door which it has aright to keep closed and at which even queens and duchesses if theywish to enter must knock humbly and reverently</s> mary was almost overcome by her kindness</s>  she thanked her over andover at times my mother said she looked at her wistfully as if onthe very point of speaking and then quietly gathering herself withinherself she remained silent</s>  all that could be got from her was thatit was necessary for her hereafter to live in new york</s> the servants in the kitchen with the warmheartedness of their racebroke out into a perfect irish howl of sorrow and at the last momentbiddy our fat cook fell on her neck and lifted up her voice andwept almost smothering her with her tumultuous embraces and thewhole party of them would go with her to the new york station onecarrying her shawl another her handbag and parasol with emulousaffection and so our very pleasant and desirable second girldisappeared and we saw her no more</s> six months after this when our mary had become only a memory of thepast i went to spend a week or two in newport and took among othermatters and things a letter of introduction to mrs</s>  mcintyre ascotch lady who had just bought a pretty cottage there and as myfriend who gave it told me would prove an interesting acquaintance</s> she has a pretty niece said he who im told is heiress to herproperty and is called a very nice girl</s> so at the proper time i lounged in one morning and found a

paintingand papering there was no end to that</s>  then my wife wanted a door cuthere to make our bedroom more convenient and a china closet knockedup there where no china closet before had been</s>  we even ventured onthrowing out a baywindow from our sittingroom because we hadluckily lighted on a workman who was so cheap that it was an actualsaving of money to employ him</s>  and to be sure our darling littlecottage did lift up its head wonderfully for all this garnishing andfurbishing</s>  i got up early every morning and nailed up therosebushes and my wife got up and watered geraniums and

so says i tomy wife i will bring out a gardener when i come next time and heshall lay the garden out and get it into order and after that i caneasily keep it by the work of my leisure hours</s> our gardener was a very sublime sort of manan englishman and ofcourse used to laying out noblemens placesand we became asgrasshoppers in our own eyes when he talked of lord this and thatsestate and began to question us about our carriage drive andconservatory and we could with difficulty bring the gentleman down toany understanding of the humble limits of our expectations merely todress out the walks and lay out a kitchen garden and plant potatoesturnips beets and carrots was quite a descent for him</s>  in fact sostrong were his sthetic preferences that he persuaded my wife to lethim dig all the turf off from a green square opposite the bay windowand to lay it out into divers little triangles resembling smallpieces of pie together with circles mounds and various othergeometrical ornaments the planning and planting of which soonengrossed my wifes whole soul</s>  the planting of the potatoes beetscarrots etc</s>  was intrusted to a raw irishman for as to me toconfess the truth i began to fear that digging did not agree with me</s> it is true that i was exceedingly vigorous at first and actuallyplanted with my own hands two or three long rows of potatoes afterwhich i got a turn of rheumatism in my shoulder which lasted me aweek</s>  stooping down to plant beets and radishes gave me a vertigo sothat i was obliged to content myself with a general superintendenceof the garden that is to say i charged my englishman to see that myirishman did his duty properly and then got on to my horse and rodeto the city</s>  but about one part of the matter i must say i was notremiss and that is in the purchase of seed and garden utensils</s>  nota day passed that i did not come home with my pockets stuffed withchoice seeds roots etc</s>  and the variety of my garden utensils wasunequaled</s>  there was not a priming hook of any pattern not a hoerake or spade great or small that i did not have specimens of andflower seeds and bulbs were also forthcoming in liberal proportions</s> in fact i had opened an account at a thriving seed store for when aman is driving business on a large scale it is not always convenientto hand out the change for every little matter and buying things onaccount is as neat and agreeable a mode of acquisition as paying billswith ones notes</s> you know we must have a cow said my wife the morning of our secondweek</s>  our friend the gardener who had now worked with us at the rateof two dollars a day for two weeks was at hand in a moment in ouremergency</s>  we wanted to buy a cow and he had one to sella wonderfulcow of a real

forty dollars were speedily forthcoming and so also was the cow</s> what makes her shake her head in that way</s>  said my wife apprehensivelyas she observed the interesting beast making sundry demonstrations withher horns</s>  i hope shes gentle</s> the gardener fluently demonstrated that the animal was a pattern ofall the softer graces and that this headshaking was merely a littlenervous affection consequent on the embarrassment of a new position</s> we had faith to believe almost anything at this time and thereforecame from the barn yard to the house as much satisfied with ourpurchase as job with his three thousand camels and five hundred yokeof oxen</s>  her quondam master milked her for us the first evening outof a delicate regard to her feelings as a stranger and we fanciedthat we discerned forty dollars worth of excellence in the veryquality of the milk</s> but alas</s>  the next morning our irish girl came in with a most ruefulface</s>  and is it milking that baste youd have me be after</s>  she saidsure and she wont let me come near her</s> nonsense biddy</s>  said i you frightened her perhaps the cow isperfectly gentle and with the pail on my arm i sallied forth</s>  themoment madam saw me entering the cow yard she greeted me with a veryexpressive flourish of her horns</s> this wont do said i and i stopped</s>  the lady evidently was seriousin her intentions of resisting any personal approaches</s>  i cut acudgel and putting on a bold face marched towards her while biddyfollowed with her milking stool</s>  apparently the beast saw thenecessity of temporizing for she assumed a demure expression andbiddy sat down to milk</s>  i stood sentry and if the lady shook her headi shook my stick and thus the milking operation proceeded withtolerable serenity and success</s> there</s>  said i with dignity when the frothing pail was full to thebrim</s>  that will do biddy and i dropped my stick</s>  dump</s>  camemadams heel on the side of the pail and it flew like a rocket intothe air while the milky flood showered plentifully over me and a newbroadcloth ridingcoat that i had assumed for the first time thatmorning</s>  whew</s>  said i as soon as i could get my breath from thisextraordinary shower bath whats all this</s>  my wife came runningtowards the cow yard as i stood with the milk streaming from my hairfilling my eyes and dropping from the tip of my nose and she andbiddy performed a recitative lamentation over me in alternatestrophes like the chorus in a greek tragedy</s>  such was our firstmornings experience but as we had announced our bargain with someconsiderable flourish of trumpets among our neighbors and friends weconcluded to hush the matter up as much as possible</s> these very superior cows are apt to be cross said i we must bearwith it as we do with the eccentricities of genius besides when shegets accustomed to us it will be better</s> madam was therefore installed into her pretty pasture lot and my wifecontemplated with pleasure the picturesque effect of her appearancereclining on the green slope of the pasture lot or standing ankledeep in the gurgling brook or reclining under the deep shadows of thetrees</s>  she was in fact a handsome cow which may account in partfor some of her sins and this consideration inspired me with somedegree of indulgence towards her foibles</s> but when i found that biddy could never succeed in getting near her inthe pasture and that any kind of success in the milking operationsrequired my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening thematter wore a more serious aspect and i began to feel quite pensiveand apprehensive</s>  it is very well to talk of the pleasures of themilkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn butimagine

madamestablished a regular series of exercises which had all to be gonethrough before she would suffer herself to be captured as first shewould station herself plump in the middle of a marsh which lay at thelower part of the lot and look very innocent and absentminded as ifreflecting on some sentimental subject</s>  suke</s>  suke</s>  suke</s>  iejaculate cautiously tottering along the edge of the

air imaginable aswho should say i hope you are not hurt sir</s>  i dash through swampand bog furiously resolving to carry all by a coup de main</s>  thenfollows a miscellaneous season of dodging scampering and bopeepingamong the trees of the grove interspersed with sundry occasionalraces across the bog aforesaid</s>  i always wondered how i caught herevery day and when i had tied her head to one post and her heels toanother i wiped the sweat from my brow and thought i was paying dearfor the eccentricities of genius</s>  a genius she certainly was forbesides her surprising agility she had other talents equallyextraordinary</s>  there was no fence that she could not take downnowhere that she could not go</s>  she took the pickets off the gardenfence at her pleasure using her horns as handily as i could use aclaw hammer</s>  whatever she had a mind to whether it were a bite in thecabbage garden or a run in the corn patch or a foraging expeditioninto the flower borders she made herself equally welcome and at home</s> such a scampering and driving such cries of suke here and sukethere as constantly greeted our ears kept our little establishmentin a constant commotion</s>  at last when she one morning made a plungeat the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat and carried off oneflap on her horns my patience gave out and i determined to sellher</s> as however i had made a good story of my misfortunes among myfriends and neighbors and amused them with sundry whimsical accountsof my various adventures in the cowcatching line i found when icame to speak of selling that there was a general coolness on thesubject and nobody seemed disposed to be the recipient of myresponsibilities</s>  in short i was glad at last to get fifteendollars for her and comforted myself with thinking that i had atleast gained twentyfive dollars worth of experience in thetransaction to say nothing of the fine exercise</s> i comforted my soul however the day after by purchasing andbringing home to my wife a fine swarm of bees</s> your bee now says i is a really classical insect and breathesof virgil and the augustan ageand then she is a domestic tranquilplacid creature</s>  how beautiful the murmuring of a hive near ourhoneysuckle of a calm summer evening</s>  then they are tranquilly andpeacefully amassing for us their stores of sweetness while they lullus with their murmurs</s>  what a beautiful image of disinterestedbenevolence</s> my wife declared that i was quite a poet and the beehive was dulyinstalled near the flower plots that the delicate creatures mighthave the full benefit of the honeysuckle and mignonette</s>  my spiritsbegan to rise</s>  i bought three different treatises on the rearing ofbees and also one or two new patterns of hives and proposed to rearmy bees on the most approved model</s>  i charged all the establishment tolet me know when there was any indication of an emigrating spiritthat i might be ready to receive the new swarm into my patentmansion</s> accordingly one afternoon when i was deep in an article that i waspreparing for the north american review intelligence was brought methat a swarm had risen</s>  i was on the alert at once and discovered ongoing out that the provoking creatures had chosen the top of a treeabout thirty feet high to settle on</s>  now my books had carefullyinstructed me just how to approach the swarm and cover them with anew hive but i had never contemplated the possibility of the swarmbeing like hamans gallows forty cubits high</s>  i looked despairinglyupon the smoothbark tree which rose like a column full twentyfeet without branch or twig</s>  what is to be done</s>  said i appealingto two or three neighbors</s>  at last at the recommendation of one ofthem a ladder was raised against the tree and equipped with a shirtoutside of my clothes a green veil over my head and a pair ofleather gloves on my hands i went up with a saw at my girdle to sawoff the branch on which they had settled and lower it by a rope to aneighbor similarly equipped who stood below with the hive</s> as a result of this manoeuvre the fastidious little insects were atlength fairly installed at housekeeping in my new patent hive andrejoicing in my success i again sat down to my article</s> that evening my wife and i took tea in our honeysuckle arbor with ourlittle ones and a friend or two to whom i showed my treasures andexpatiated at large on the comforts and conveniences of the new patenthive</s> but alas for the hopes of man</s>  the little ungrateful wretcheswhatmust they do but take

entirelyunprepared to appreciate improvements</s> meanwhile the seeds began to germinate in our garden when we foundto our chagrin that between john bull and paddy there had occurredsundry confusions in the several departments</s>  radishes had beenplanted broadcast carrots and beets arranged in hills and here andthere a whole paper of seed appeared to have been planted bodily</s>  mygood old uncle who somewhat to my confusion made me a call at thistime was greatly distressed and scandalized by the appearance of ourgarden</s>  but by a deal of fussing transplanting and replanting itwas got into some shape and order</s>  my uncle was rather troublesome ascareful old people are apt to beannoying us by perpetual inquiriesof what we gave for this and that and running up
