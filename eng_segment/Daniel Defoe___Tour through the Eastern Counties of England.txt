tour through the eastern counties of england 1722i began my travels where i purpose to end them viz</s>  at the cityof london and therefore my account of the city itself will comelast that is to say at the latter end of my southern progressand as in the course of this journey i shall have many occasions tocall it a circuit if not a circle so i chose to give it the titleof circuits in the plural because i do not pretend to havetravelled it all in one journey but in many and some of them manytimes over the better to inform myself of everything i could findworth taking notice of</s> i hope it will appear that i am not the less but the more capableof giving a full account of things by how much the moredeliberation i have taken in the view of them and by how much theoftener i have had opportunity to see them</s> i set out the 3rd of april 1722 going first eastward and tookwhat i think i may very honestly call a circuit in the very letterof it for i went down by the coast of the thames through themarshes or hundreds on the south side of the county of essex tilli came to malden colchester and harwich thence continuing on thecoast of suffolk to yarmouth thence round by the edge of the seaon the north and west side of norfolk to lynn wisbech and thewash thence back again on the north side of suffolk and essex tothe west ending it in middlesex near the place where i began itreserving the middle or centre of the several counties to somelittle excursions which i made by themselves</s> passing bow bridge where the county of essex begins the firstobservation i made was that all the villages which may be calledthe neighbourhood of the city of london on this as well as on theother sides thereof which i shall speak to in their order i sayall those villages are increased in buildings to a strange degreewithin the compass of about twenty or thirty years past at themost</s> the village of stratford the first in this county from london isnot only increased but i believe more than doubled in that timeevery vacancy filled up with new houses and two little towns orhamlets as they may be called on the forest side of the townentirely new namely maryland point and the gravel pits one facingthe road to woodford and epping and the other facing the road toilford and as for the hither part it is almost joined to bow inspite of rivers canals marshy grounds c</s>  nor is this increaseof building the case only in this and all the other villages roundlondon but the increase of the value and rent of the housesformerly standing has in that compass of years abovementionedadvanced to a very great degree and i may venture to say at leastthe fifth part some think a third part above what they werebefore</s> this is indeed most visible speaking of stratford in essex but itis the same thing in proportion in other villages adjacentespecially on the forest side as at low leyton leytonstonewalthamstow woodford wanstead and the towns of west hamplaistow upton etc</s>  in all which places or near them as theinhabitants say above a thousand new foundations have beenerected besides old houses repaired all since the revolution andthis is not to be forgotten too that this increase is generallyspeaking of handsome large houses from 20 pounds a year to 60pounds very few under 20 pounds a year being chiefly for thehabitations of the richest citizens such as either are able tokeep two houses one in the country and one in the city or forsuch citizens as being rich and having left off trade livealtogether in these neighbouring villages for the pleasure andhealth of the latter part of their days</s> the truth of this may at least appear in that they tell me thereare no less than two hundred coaches kept by the inhabitants withinthe circumference of these few villages named above besides suchas are kept by accidental lodgers</s> this increase of the inhabitants and the cause of it i shallenlarge upon when i come to speak of the like in the counties ofmiddlesex surrey c where it is the same only in a much greaterdegree</s>  but this i must take notice of here that this increasecauses those villages to be much pleasanter and more sociable thanformerly for now people go to them not for retirement into thecountry but for good company of which that i may speak to theladies as well as other authors do there are in these villagesnay in all three or four excepted excellent conversation and agreat deal of it and that without the mixture of assembliesgaminghouses and public foundations of vice and debauchery andparticularly i find none of those incentives kept up on this sidethe country</s> mr</s>  camden and his learned continuator bishop gibson haveransacked this country for its antiquities and have left littleunsearched and as it is not my present design to say much of whathas been said already i shall touch very lightly where two suchexcellent antiquaries have gone before me except it be to add whatmay have been since discovered which as to these parts is onlythis that there seems to be lately found out in the bottom of themarshes generally called hackney marsh and beginning near aboutthe place now called the wick between old ford and the said wickthe remains of a great stone causeway which as it is supposedwas the highway or great road from london into essex and the samewhich goes now over the great bridge between bow and stratford</s> that the great road lay this way and that the great causewaylanded again just over the river where now the temple mills standand passed by sir thomas hickess house at ruckolls all this isnot doubted and that it was one of those famous highways made bythe romans there is undoubted proof by the several marks of romanwork and by roman coins and other antiquities found there some ofwhich are said to be deposited in the hands of the rev</s>
 mr</s>  strypevicar of the parish of low leyton</s>
from hence the great road passed up to leytonstone a place by someknown now as much by the sign of the green man formerly a lodgeupon the edge of the forest and crossing by wanstead houseformerly the dwelling of sir josiah child now of his son the lordcastlemain of which hereafter went over the same river which wenow pass at ilford and passing that part of the great forest whichwe now call hainault forest came into that which is now the greatroad a little on this side the whalebone a place on the road socalled because the ribbone of a great whale which was taken inthe river thames the same year that oliver cromwell died 1658 wasfixed there for a monument of that monstrous creature it being atfirst about eightandtwenty feet long</s> according to my first intention of effectually viewing the seacoast of these three counties i went from stratford to barking alarge markettown but chiefly inhabited by fishermen whose smacksride in the thames at the mouth of their river from whence theirfish is sent up to london to the market at billingsgate by smallboats of which i shall speak by itself in my description oflondon</s> one thing i cannot omit in the mention of these barking fishersmacks viz</s>  that one of those fishermen a very substantial andexperienced man convinced me that all the pretences to bringingfish alive to london market from the north seas and other remoteplaces on the coast of great britain by the newbuilt sloopscalled fishpools have not been able to do anything but what theirfishingsmacks are able on the same occasion to perform</s>  thesefishingsmacks are very useful vessels to the public upon manyoccasions as particularly in time of war they are used as presssmacks running to all the northern and western coasts to pick upseamen to man the navy when any expedition is at hand thatrequires a sudden equipment at other times being excellentsailors they are tenders to particular men of war and on anexpedition they have been made use of as machines for the blowingup of fortified ports and havens as at calais st</s>  malo and otherplaces</s> this parish of barking is very large and by the improvement oflands taken in out of the thames and out of the river which runsby the town the tithes as the townsmen assured me are worthabove 600 pounds per annum including small tithes</s>  note</s> thisparish has two or three chapels of ease viz</s>  one at ilford andone on the side of hainault forest called new chapel</s> sir thomas fanshaw of an ancient roman catholic family has a verygood estate in this parish</s>  a little beyond the town on the roadto dagenham stood a great house ancient and now almost fallendown where tradition says the gunpowder treason plot was at firstcontrived and that all the first consultations about it were heldthere</s> this side of the county is rather rich in land than in inhabitantsoccasioned chiefly by the unhealthiness of the air for these lowmarsh grounds which with all the south side of the county havebeen saved out of the river thames and out of the sea where theriver is wide enough to be called so begin here or rather beginat west ham by stratford and continue to extend themselves fromhence eastward growing wider and wider till we come beyondtilbury when the flat country lies six seven or eight milesbroad and is justly said to be both unhealthy and unpleasant</s> however the lands are rich and as is observable it is very goodfarming in the marshes because the landlords let good pennyworthsfor it being a place where everybody cannot live those thatventure it will have encouragement and indeed it is but reasonablethey should</s> several little observations i made in this part of the county ofessex</s> 1</s>  we saw passing from barking to dagenham the famous breachmade by an inundation of the thames which was so great as that itlaid near 5000 acres of land under water but which after near tenyears lying under water and being several times blown up has beenat last effectually stopped by the application of captain perrythe gentleman who for several years had been employed in the czarof muscovys works at veronitza on the river don</s>  this breachappeared now effectually made up and they assured us that the newwork where the breach was is by much esteemed the strongest ofall the sea walls in that level</s> 2</s>  it was observable that great part of the lands in these levelsespecially those on this side east tilbury are held by thefarmers cowkeepers and grazing butchers who live in and nearlondon and that they are generally stocked all the winter halfyear with large fat sheep viz</s>  lincolnshire and leicestershirewethers which they buy in smithfield in september and octoberwhen the lincolnshire and leicestershire graziers sell off theirstock and are kept here till christmas or candlemas orthereabouts and though they are not made at all fatter here thanthey were when bought in yet the farmer or butcher finds very goodadvantage in it by the difference of the price of mutton betweenmichaelmas when it is cheapest and candlemas when it is dearestthis is what the butchers value themselves upon when they tell usat the market that it is right marshmutton</s> 3</s>  in the bottom of these marshes and close to the edge of theriver stands the strong fortress of tilbury called tilbury fortwhich may justly be looked upon as the key of the river thames andconsequently the key of the city of london</s>  it is a regularfortification</s>  the design of it was a pentagon but the waterbastion as it would have been called was never built</s>  the planwas laid out by sir martin beckman chief engineer to king charlesii</s>  who also designed the works at sheerness</s>  the esplanade ofthe fort is very large and the bastions the largest of any inengland the foundation is laid so deep and piles under thatdriven down two an end of one another so far till they wereassured they were below the channel of the river and that thepiles which were shed with iron entered into the solid chalk rockadjoining to or reaching from the chalk hills on the other side</s> these bastions settled considerably at first as did also part ofthe curtain the great quantity of earth that was brought to fillthem up necessarily requiring to be made solid by time but theyare now firm as the rocks of chalk which they came from and thefilling up one of these bastions as i have been told by goodhands cost the government 6000 pounds being filled with chalkrubbish fetched from the chalk pits at northfleet just abovegravesend</s> the work to the land side is complete the bastions are faced withbrick</s>  there is a double ditch or moat the innermost part ofwhich is 180 feet broad there is a good counterscarp and acovered way marked out with ravelins and tenailles but they arenot raised a second time after their first settling</s> on the land side there are also two small redoubts of brick but ofvery little strength for the chief strength of this fort on theland side consists in this that they are able to lay the wholelevel under water and so to make it impossible for an enemy tomake any approaches to the fort that way</s> on the side next the river there is a very strong curtain with anoble gate called the water gate in the middle and the ditch ispalisadoed</s>  at the place where the water bastion was designed tobe built and which by the plan should run wholly out into theriver so to flank the two curtains of each side i say in theplace where it should have been stands a high tower which theytell us was built in queen elizabeths time and was called theblock house the side next the water is vacant</s> before this curtain above and below the said vacancy is aplatform in the place of a counterscarp on which are planted 106pieces of cannon generally all of them carrying from twentyfourto fortysix pound ball a battery so terrible as well imports theconsequence of that place besides which there are smaller piecesplanted between and the bastions and curtain also are planted withguns so that they must be bold fellows who will venture in thebiggest ships the world has heard of to pass such a battery if themen appointed to serve the guns do their duty like stout fellowsas becomes them</s> the present government of this important place is under the prudentadministration of the right honourable the lord newbrugh</s> from hence there is nothing for many miles together remarkable buta continued level of unhealthy marshes called the three hundredstill we come before leigh and to the mouth of the river chelmerand blackwater</s>  these rivers united make a large firth or inletof the sea which by mr</s>  camden is called idumanum fluvium but byour fishermen and seamen who use it as a port it is called maldenwater</s> in this inlet of the sea is osey or osyth island commonly calledoosy island so well known by our london men of pleasure for theinfinite number of wild fowl that is to say duck mallard tealand widgeon of which there are such vast flights that they tellus the island namely the creek seems covered with them at certaintimes of the year and they go from london on purpose for thepleasure of shooting and indeed often come home very well ladenwith game</s>  but it must be remembered too that those gentlemen whoare such lovers of the sport and go so far for it often returnwith an essex ague on their backs which they find a heavier loadthan the fowls they have shot</s> it is on this shore and near this creek that the greatestquantity of fresh fish is caught which supplies not this countryonly but london markets also</s>  on the shore beginning a littlebelow candy island or rather below leigh road there lies a greatshoal or sand called the black tail which runs out near threeleagues into the sea due east at the end of it stands a pole ormast set up by the trinity house men of london whose business isto lay buoys and set up sea marks for the direction of the sailorsthis is called shoe beacon from the point of land where this sandbegins which is called shoeburyness and that from the town ofshoebury which stands by it</s>  from this sand and on the edge ofshoebury before it or south west of it all along to the mouthof colchester water the shore is full of shoals and sands withsome deep channels between all which are so full of fish that notonly the barking fishingsmacks come hither to fish but the wholeshore is full of small fisherboats in very great numbersbelonging to the villages and towns on the coast who come in everytide with what they take and selling the smaller fish in thecountry send the best and largest away upon horses which go nightand day to london market</s> n</s> b</s> i am the more particular in my remarks on this place becausein the course of my travels the reader will meet with the like inalmost every place of note through the whole island where it willbe seen how this whole kingdom as well the people as the land andeven the sea in every part of it are employed to furnishsomething and i may add the best of everything to supply thecity of london with provisions i mean by provisions corn fleshfish butter cheese salt fuel timber etc</s>  and clothes alsowith everything necessary for building and furniture for their ownuse or for trade of all which in their order</s> on this shore also are taken the best and nicest though not thelargest oysters in england the spot from whence they have theircommon appellation is a little bank called woelfleet scarce to becalled an island in the mouth of the river crouch now calledcrooksea water but the chief place where the said oysters are nowhad is from wyvenhoe and the shores adjacent whither they arebrought by the fishermen who take them at the mouth of that theycall colchester water and about the sand they call the spits andcarry them up to wyvenhoe where they are laid in beds or pits onthe shore to feed as they call it and then being barrelled up andcarried to colchester which is but three miles off they are sentto london by land and are from thence called colchester oysters</s> the chief sort of other fish which they carry from this part of theshore to london are soles which they take sometimes exceedinglarge and yield a very good price at london market</s>  alsosometimes middling turbot with whiting codling and largeflounders the small fish as above they sell in the country</s> in the several creeks and openings as above on this shore thereare also other islands but of no particular note except merseywhich lies in the middle of the two openings between malden waterand colchester water being of the most difficult access so thatit is thought a thousand men well provided might keep possession ofit against a great force whether by land or sea</s>  on this accountand because if possessed by an enemy it would shut up all thenavigation and fishery on that side the government formerly builta fort on the southeast point of it and generally in case ofdutch war there is a strong body of troops kept there to defendit</s>
at this place may be said to end what we call the hundreds ofessexthat is to say the three hundreds or divisions whichinclude the marshy country viz</s>  barnstable hundred rochfordhundred and dengy hundred</s> i have one remark more before i leave this damp part of the worldand which i cannot omit on the womens account namely that i tooknotice of a strange decay of the sex here insomuch that all alongthis country it was very frequent to meet with men that had hadfrom five or six to fourteen or fifteen wives nay and some more</s> and i was informed that in the marshes on the other side of theriver over against candy island there was a farmer who was thenliving with the fiveandtwentieth wife and that his son who wasbut about thirtyfive years old had already had about fourteen</s> indeed this part of the story i only had by report though fromgood hands too but the other is well known and easy to be inquiredinto about fobbing curringham thundersly benfleet prittlewellwakering great stambridge cricksea burnham dengy and othertowns of the like situation</s>  the reason as a merry fellow toldme who said he had had about a dozen and a half of wives though ifound afterwards he fibbed a little was this that they beingbred in the marshes themselves and seasoned to the place didpretty well with it but that they always went up into the hillycountry or to speak their own language into the uplands for awife</s>  that when they took the young lasses out of the wholesomeand fresh air they were healthy fresh and clear and well butwhen they came out of their native air into the marshes among thefogs and damps there they presently changed their complexion gotan ague or two and seldom held it above half a year or a year atmost and then said he we go to the uplands again and fetchanother so that marrying of wives was reckoned a kind of goodfarm to them</s>  it is true the fellow told this in a kind ofdrollery and mirth but the fact for all that is certainly trueand that they have abundance of wives by that very means</s>  nor isit less true that the inhabitants in these places do not hold itout as in other countries and as first you seldom meet with veryancient people among the poor as in other places we do so takeit one with another not onehalf of the inhabitants are natives ofthe place but such as from other countries or in other parts ofthis country settle here for the advantage of good farms for whichi appeal to any impartial inquiry having myself examined into itcritically in several places</s> from the marshes and low grounds being not able to travel withoutmany windings and indentures by reason of the creeks and waters icame up to the town of malden a noted market town situate at theconflux or joining of two principal rivers in this county thechelm or chelmer and the blackwater and where they enter into thesea</s>  the channel as i have noted is called by the sailors maldenwater and is navigable up to the town where by that means is agreat trade for carrying corn by water to london the county ofessex being especially on all that side a great corn county</s> when i have said this i think i have done malden justice and saidall of it that there is to be said unless i should run into theold story of its antiquity and tell you it was a roman colony inthe time of vespasian and that it was called camolodunum</s>  how thebritons under queen boadicea in revenge for the romans illusageof herfor indeed they used her majesty illthey stripped hernaked and whipped her publicly through their streets for someaffront she had given them</s>  i say how for this she raised thebritons round the country overpowered and cut in pieces the tenthlegion killed above eighty thousand romans and destroyed thecolony but was afterwards overthrown in a great battle and sixtythousand britons slain</s>  i say unless i should enter into thisstory i have nothing more to say of malden and as for thatstory it is so fully related by mr</s>  camden in his history of theromans in britain at the beginning of his britannia that i needonly refer the reader to it and go on with my journey</s> being obliged to come thus far into the uplands as above i madeit my road to pass through witham a pleasant wellsituated markettown in which and in its neighbourhood there are as manygentlemen of good fortunes and families as i believe can be metwith in so narrow a compass in any of the three counties of which imake this circuit</s> in the town of witham dwells the lord pasely oldest son of theearl of abercorn of ireland a branch of the noble family ofhamilton in scotland</s>  his lordship has a small but a neatwellbuilt new house and is finishing his gardens in such a manneras few in that part of england will exceed them</s> nearer chelmsford hard by boreham lives the lord viscountbarrington who though not born to the title or estate or namewhich he now possesses had the honour to be twice made heir to theestates of gentlemen not at all related to him at least one ofthem as is very much to his honour mentioned in his patent ofcreation</s>  his name was shute his father a linendraper in londonand served sheriff of the said

near malden sirthomas webster at copthall near waltham and several others</s> i mention this to observe how the present increase of wealth in thecity of london spreads itself into the country and plants familiesand fortunes who in another age will equal the families of theancient gentry who perhaps were brought out</s>  i shall take noticeof this in a general head and when i have run through all thecounties collect a list of the families of citizens and tradesmenthus established in the several counties especially round london</s> the product of all this part of the country is corn as that of themarshy feeding grounds mentioned above is grass where their chiefbusiness is breeding of calves which i need not say are the bestand fattest and the largest veal in england if not in the worldand as an instance i ate part of a veal or calf fed by the latesir josiah child at wanstead the loin of which weighed abovethirty pounds and the flesh exceeding white and fat</s> from hence i went on to colchester</s>  the story of killdane whichis told of the town of kelvedon three miles from witham namelythat this is the place where the massacre of the danes was begun bythe women and that therefore it was called killdane i say of itas we generally say of improbable news it wants confirmation</s>  thetrue name of the town is kelvedon and has been so for many hundredyears</s>

town is large verypopulous the streets fair and beautiful and though it may notsaid to be finely built yet there are abundance of very good andwellbuilt houses in it</s>  it still mourns in the ruins of a civilwar during which or rather after the heat of the war was over itsuffered a severe siege which the garrison making a resolutedefence was turned into a blockade in which the garrison andinhabitants also suffered the utmost extremity of hunger and wereat last obliged to surrender at discretion when their two chiefofficers sir charles lucas and sir george lisle were shot todeath under the castle wall</s>  the inhabitants had a tradition thatno grass would grow upon the spot where the blood of those twogallant gentlemen was spilt and they showed the place bare ofgrass for many years but whether for this reason i will notaffirm</s>  the story is now dropped and the grass i suppose growsthere as in other places</s> however the battered walls the breaches in the turrets and

given thesaid general fairfax the slip and having passed the thames atgreenwich were come to stratford and were advancing this wayupon which news sir charles lucas sir george lisle colonel cookand several gentlemen of the loyal army and all that hadcommissions from the king with a gallant appearance of gentlemenvolunteers drew together from all parts of the country to joinwith them</s> the 8th we were further informed that they were advanced tochelmsford to new hall house and to witham and the 9th some ofthe horse arrived in the town taking possession of the gates andhaving engineers with them told us that general goring hadresolved to make this town his headquarters and would cause it tobe well fortified</s>  they also caused the drums to beat forvolunteers and a good number of the poor bayweavers and suchlike people wanting employment enlisted so that they completedsir charles lucass regiment which was but thin to near eighthundred men</s> on the 10th we had news that the lord fairfax having beaten theroyalists at maidstone and retaken rochester had passed thethames at gravesend though with great difficulty and with someloss and was come to horndononthehill in order to gaincolchester before the royalists but that hearing sir charles lucashad prevented him had ordered his rendezvous at billerecay andintended to possess the pass at malden on the 11th where sirthomas

hisarmy there the same night</s> the lord goring brought in prisoners the same day sir williammasham and several other gentlemen of the county who were securedunder a strong guard which the parliament hearing ordered twentyprisoners of the royal party to be singled out declaring thatthey should be used in the same manner as the lord goring used sirwilliam masham and the gentlemen prisoners with him</s> on the 13th early in the morning our spies brought intelligencethat the lord fairfax all his forces being come up to him wasmaking dispositions for a march resolving to attack the royalistsin their camp upon which the lord goring drew all his forcestogether resolving to fight</s>  the engineers had offered the nightbefore to entrench his camp and to draw a line round it in onenights time but his lordship declined it and now there was notime for it whereupon the general lord goring drew up his armyin order of battle on both sides the road the horse in the openfields on the wings the foot were drawn up one regiment in theroad one regiment on each side and two regiments for reserve inthe suburb just at the entrance of the town with a regiment ofvolunteers advanced as a forlorn hope and a regiment of horse atthe headgate ready to support the reserve as occasion shouldrequire</s> about nine in the morning we heard the enemys drums beat a marchand in half an hour more their first troops appeared on the highergrounds towards lexden</s>  immediately the cannon from st</s>  marysfired upon them and put some troops of horse into confusion doinggreat execution which they not being able to shun it made themquicken their pace fall on when our cannon were obliged to ceasefiring lest we should hurt our own troops as well as the enemy</s> soon after their foot appeared and our cannon saluted them inlike manner and killed them a great many men</s> their first line of foot was led up by colonel barkstead andconsisted of three regiments of foot making about 1700 men andthese charged our regiment in the lane commanded by sir georgelisle and sir william campion</s>  they fell on with great fury andwere received with as much gallantry and three times repulsed norcould they break in here though the lord fairfax sent fresh men tosupport them till the royalists horse oppressed with numbers onthe left were obliged to retire and at last to come full gallopinto the street and so on into the town</s>  nay still the footstood firm and the volunteers being all gentlemen kept theirground with the greatest resolution but the left wing beingrouted as above sir william campion was obliged to make a frontto the left and lining the hedge with his musketeers made a standwith a body of pikes against the enemys horse and prevented thementering the lane</s>  here that gallant gentleman was killed with acarabine shot and after a very gallant resistance the horse onthe right being also overpowered the word was given to retreatwhich however was done in such good order the regiments ofreserve standing drawn up at the end of the street ready toreceive the enemys horse upon the points of their pikes that theroyal troops came on in the openings between the regiments andentered the town with very little loss and in very good order</s> by this however those regiments of reserve were brought at lastto sustain the efforts of the enemys whole army till beingoverpowered by numbers they were put into disorder and forced toget into the town in the best manner they could by which meansnear two hundred men were killed or made prisoners</s> encouraged by this success the enemy pushed on supposing theyshould enter the town pellmell with the rest nor did theroyalists hinder them but let good part of barksteads ownregiment enter the headgate but then sallying from st</s>  maryswith a choice body of foot on their left and the horse rallying inthe high street and charging them again in the front they weredriven back quite into the street of the suburb and most of thosethat had so rashly entered were cut in pieces</s> thus they were repulsed at the south entrance into the town andthough they attempted to storm three times after that with greatresolution yet they were as often beaten back and that with greathavoc of their men and the cannon from the fort all the while didexecution upon those who stood drawn up to support them so that atlast seeing no good to be done they retreated having small joyof their pretended victory</s> they lost in this action colonel needham who commanded a regimentcalled the tower guards and who fought

that as they hadreduced the kings servants to eat horseflesh the prisoners shouldfeed as they fed</s> the enemy sent again to complain of the royalists shooting poisonedbullets and sent two affidavits

from colchester i took another step down to the coast the landrunning out a great way into the sea south and southeast makesthat promontory of land called the naze and well known to seamenusing the

at the public expense being a round brick tower near eightyfeet high</s>  the sea gains so much upon the land here by thecontinual winds at southwest that within the memory of some ofthe inhabitants there they have lost above thirty acres of land inone place</s> from hence we go back into the county about four miles because ofthe creeks which lie between and then turning east again come toharwich on the utmost eastern point of this large country</s> harwich is a town so well known and so perfectly described by manywriters i need say little of it</s>  it is strong by situation andmay be made more so by art</s>  but it is many years since thegovernment of england have had any occasion to fortify towns to thelandward it is enough that the harbour or road which is one ofthe best and securest in england is covered at the entrance by astrong fort and a battery of guns to the seaward just as attilbury and which sufficiently defend the mouth of the river</s>  andthere is a particular felicity in this fortification viz</s>  thatthough the entrance or opening of the river into the sea is verywide especially at highwater at least two miles if not threeover yet the channel which is deep and in which the ships mustkeep and come to the harbour is narrow and lies only on the sideof the fort so that all the ships which come in or go out mustcome close under the guns of the fortthat is to say under thecommand of their shot</s> the fort is on the suffolk side of the bay or entrance but standsso far into the sea upon the point of a sand or shoal which runsout toward the essex side as it were laps over the mouth of thathaven like a blind to it and our surveyors of the country affirmit to be in the county of essex</s>  the making this place which wasformerly no other than a sand in the sea solid enough for thefoundation of so good a fortification has not been done but bymany years labour often repairs and an infinite expense ofmoney but it is now so firm that nothing of storms and high tidesor such things as make the sea dangerous to these kind of workscan affect it</s> the harbour is of a vast extent for as two rivers emptythemselves here viz</s>  stour from manningtree and the orwell fromipswich the channels of both are large and deep and safe for allweathers so where they join they make a large bay or road able toreceive the biggest ships and the greatest number that ever theworld saw together i mean ships of war</s>  in the old dutch wargreat use has been made of this harbour and i have known thatthere has been one hundred sail of menofwar and their attendantsand between three and four hundred sail of collier ships all inthis harbour at a time and yet none of them crowding or riding indanger of one another</s> harwich is known for being the port where the packet boats betweenengland and holland go out and come in</s>  the inhabitants are farfrom being famed for good usage to strangers but on the contraryare blamed for being extravagant in their reckonings in the publichouses which has not a little encouraged the setting up of sloopswhich they now call passage boats to holland to go directly fromthe river thames this though it may be something the longerpassage yet as they are said to be more obliging to passengers andmore reasonable in the expense and as some say also the vesselsare better sea boats has been the reason why so many passengers donot go or come by the way of harwich as formerly were wont to doinsomuch that the stage coaches between this place and londonwhich ordinarily went twice or three times a week are now entirelylaid down and the passengers are left to hire coaches on purposetake posthorses or hire horses to colchester as they find mostconvenient</s> the account of a petrifying quality in the earth here though somewill have it to be in the water of a spring hard by is verystrange</s>  they boast that their town is walled and their streetspaved with clay and yet that one is as strong and the other asclean as those that are built or paved with stone</s>  the fact isindeed true for there is a sort of clay in the cliff between thetown and the beacon hill adjoining which when it falls down intothe sea where it is beaten with the waves and the weather turnsgradually into stone</s>  but the chief reason assigned is from thewater of a certain spring or well which rising in the said cliffruns down into the sea among those pieces of clay and petrifiesthem as it runs and the force of the sea often stirring andperhaps turning the lumps of clay when storms of wind may giveforce enough to the water causes them to harden everywhere alikeotherwise those which were not quite sunk in the water of thespring would be petrified but in part</s>  these stones are gatheredup to pave the streets and build the houses and are indeed veryhard</s>  it is also remarkable that some of them taken up before theyare thoroughly petrified will upon breaking them appear to behard as a stone without and soft as clay in the middle whereasothers that have lain a due time shall be thorough stone to thecentre and as exceeding hard within as without</s>  the same springis said to turn wood into iron</s>  but this i take to be no more orless than the quality which as i mentioned of the shore at thenaze is found to be in much of the stone all along this shoreviz</s>  of the copperas kind and it is certain that the copperasstone so called is found in all that cliff and even where thewater of this spring has run and i presume that those who call thehardened pieces of wood which they take out of this well by thename of iron never tried the quality of it with the fire orhammer if they had perhaps they would have given some otheraccount of it</s> on the promontory of land which they

is but little to say</s> on the road from london to colchester before i came into it atwitham lie four good market towns at equal distance from oneanother namely romford noted for two markets viz</s>  one forcalves and hogs the other for corn and other provisions most ifnot all bought up for london market</s>  at the farther end of thetown in the middle of a stately park stood guldy hall

statelyfabric or mansion house built upon the spot by sir john eyles awealthy merchant of london and chosen subgovernor of the southsea company immediately after the ruin of the former subgovernorand directors whose overthrow makes the history of these timesfamous</s> brentwood and ingatestone and even chelmsford itself have verylittle to be said of them but that they are large thoroughfaretowns full of good inns and chiefly maintained by the excessivemultitude of carriers and passengers which are constantly passingthis way to london with droves of cattle provisions andmanufactures for london</s> the last of these towns is indeed the county town where the countygaol is kept and where the assizes are very often held it standson the conflux of two riversthe chelmer whence the town

stones in the churchyard which stones hecaused to be set up in the priory churchyard for that purpose theprior and convent and as many of the town as would to be presentsuch person should have a flitch of bacon</s> i do not remember to have read that any one ever came to demand itnor do the people of the place pretend to say of their ownknowledge that they remember any that did so</s>  a long time agoseveral did demand it as they say but they know not who neitheris there any record of it nor do they tell us if it were now tobe demanded who is obliged to deliver the flitch of bacon thepriory being dissolved and gone</s> the forest of epping and hainault spreads a great part of thiscountry still</s>  i shall speak again of the former in my return fromthis circuit</s>  formerly it is thought these two forests took upall the west and south part of the county but particularly we areassured that it reached to the river chelmer and into dengyhundred and from thence again west to epping and waltham where itcontinues to be a forest still</s> probably this forest of epping has been a wild or forest ever sincethis island was inhabited and may show us in some parts of itwhere enclosures and tillage has not broken in upon it what theface of this island was before the romans time that is to saybefore their landing in britain</s> the constitution of this forest is best seen i mean as to theantiquity of it by the merry grant of it from edward the confessorbefore the norman conquest to randolph peperking one of hisfavourites who was after called peverell and whose name remainsstill in several villages in this county as particularly that ofhatfield peverell in the road from chelmsford to witham which issupposed to be originally a park which they called a field inthose days and hartfield may be as much as to say a park for doerfor the stags were in those days called harts so that this wasneither more nor less than randolph peperkings hartfieldthat isto say ralph peverells deerpark</s> n</s> b</s> this ralph randolph or ralph peverell call him as youplease had it seems a most beautiful lady to his wife who wasdaughter of ingelrick one of edward the

this lady afterwards as is supposed by way of penance for heryielding to the conqueror founded a nunnery at the village ofhatfield peverell mentioned above and there she lies buried inthe chapel of it which is now the parish church where her memoryis preserved by a tombstone under one of the windows</s> thus we have several towns where any ancient parks have beenplaced called by the name of hatfield on that very account</s>  ashatfield broad oak in this county bishops hatfield inhertfordshire and several others</s> but i return to king edwards merry way as i call it of grantingthis

neighbouring gentry</s>  i shall next proceed to the county ofsuffolk as my first design directed me to do</s> from harwich therefore having a mind to view the harbour i sentmy horses round by manningtree where there is a timber bridge overthe stour called cataway bridge and took a boat up the riverorwell for ipswich</s>  a traveller will hardly understand meespecially a seaman when i speak of the river stour and the riverorwell at harwich for they know them by no other names than thoseof manningtree water and ipswich water so while i am on saltwater i must speak as those who use the sea may understand me andwhen i am up in the country among the inland towns again i shallcall them out of their names no more</s> it is twelve miles from harwich up the water to ipswich</s>  before icome to the town i must say something of it because speaking ofthe river requires it</s>  in former times that is to say since thewriter of this remembers the place very well and particularly justbefore the late dutch wars ipswich was a town of very goodbusiness particularly it was the greatest town in england forlarge colliers or coalships employed between newcastle and london</s> also they built the biggest ships and the best for the saidfetching of coals of any that were employed in that trade</s>  theybuilt also there so prodigious strong that it was an ordinarything for an ipswich collier if no disaster happened to him toreign as seamen call it forty or fifty years and more</s> in the town of ipswich the masters of these ships generally dweltand there were as they then told me above a hundred sail of thembelonging to the town at one time the least of which carriedfifteen score as they compute it that is 300 chaldron of coalsthis was about the year 1668 when i first knew the place</s>  thismade the town be at that time so populous for those masters asthey had good ships at sea so they had large families who livedplentifully and in very good houses in the town and severalstreets were chiefly inhabited by such</s> the loss or decay of this trade accounts for the present pretendeddecay of the town of ipswich of which i shall speak morepresently</s>  the ships wore out the masters died off the tradetook a new turn dutch flyboats taken in the war and made freeships by act of parliament thrust themselves into the coaltradefor the interest of the captors such as the yarmouth and londonmerchants and others and the ipswich men dropped gradually out ofit being discouraged by those dutch flyboats</s>  these dutchvessels which cost nothing but the caption were bought cheapcarried great burthens and the ipswich building fell off for wantof price and so the trade decayed and the town with it</s>  ibelieve this will be owned for the true beginning of their decayif i must allow it to be called a decay</s> but to return to my passage up the river</s>  in the wintertime thosegreat collier ships abovementioned are always laid up as theycall it that is to say the coal trade abates at london thecitizens are generally furnished their stores taken in and thedemand is over so that the great ships the northern seas andcoast being also dangerous the nights long and the voyagehazardous go to sea no more but lie by the ships are unriggedthe sails etc</s>  carried ashore the topmasts struck and theyride moored in the river under the advantages and security ofsound ground and a high woody shore where they lie as safe as ina wet dock and it was a very agreeable sight to see perhaps twohundred sail of ships of all sizes lie in that posture everywinter</s>  all this while which was usually from michaelmas to ladyday the masters lived calm and secure with their families inipswich and enjoying plentifully what in the summer they gotlaboriously at sea and this made the town of ipswich very populousin the winter for as the masters so most of the men especiallytheir mates boatswains carpenters etc</s>  were of the same placeand lived in their proportions just as the masters did so that inthe winter there might be perhaps a thousand men in the town morethan in the summer and perhaps a greater number</s> to justify what i advance here that this town was formerly veryfull of people i ask leave to refer to the account of mr</s>  camdenand what it was in his time</s>  his words are these ipswich has acommodious harbour has been fortified with a ditch and ramparthas a great trade and is very populous being adorned withfourteen churches and large private buildings</s>  this confirmswhat i have mentioned of the former state of this town but thepresent state is my proper work i therefore return to my voyage upthe river</s> the sight of these ships thus laid up in the river as i have saidwas very agreeable to me in my passage from harwich about five andthirty years before the present journey and it was in itsproportion equally melancholy to hear that there were now scarceforty sail of good colliers that belonged to the whole town</s> in a creek in this river called lavington creek we saw at lowwater such shoals or hills rather of mussels that great boatsmight have loaded with them and no miss have been made of them</s> near this creek sir samuel barnadiston had a very fine seat asalso a decoy for wild ducks and a very noble estate but it isdivided into many branches since the death of the ancientpossessor</s>  but i proceed to the town which is the first in thecounty of suffolk of any note this way</s> ipswich is seated at the distance of twelve miles from harwichupon the edge of the river which taking a short turn to the westthe town forms there a kind of semicircle or half moon upon thebank of the river</s>  it is very remarkable that though ships of 500ton may upon a spring tide come up very near this town and manyships of that burthen have been built there yet the river is notnavigable any farther than the town itself or but very little nonot for the smallest beats nor does the tide which risessometimes thirteen or fourteen feet and gives them twentyfourfeet water very near the town flow much farther up the river thanthe town or not so much as to make it worth speaking of</s> he took little notice of the town or at least of that part ofipswich who published in his wild observations on it that ships of200 ton are built there</s>  i affirm that i have seen a ship of 400ton launched at the buildingyard close to the town and i appealto the ipswich colliers those few that remain belonging to thistown if several of them carrying seventeen score of coals whichmust be upward of 400 ton have not formerly been built here butsuperficial observers must be superficial writers if they write atall and to this day at johns ness within a mile and a half ofthe town itself ships of any burthen may be built and launchedeven at neap tides</s> i am much mistaken too if since the revolution some very goodships have not been built at this town and particularly themelford or milford galley a ship of forty guns as the greyhoundfrigate a manofwar of thirtysix to forty guns was at johnsness</s>  but what is this towards lessening the town of ipswich anymore than it would be to say they do not build menofwar or eastindia ships or ships of five hundred ton burden at st</s>  catherinesor at battle bridge in the thames</s>  when we know that a mile or twolower viz</s>  at radcliffe limehouse or deptford they build shipsof a thousand ton and might build firstrate menofwar too ifthere was occasion and the like might be done in this river ofipswich within about two or three miles of the town so that itwould not be at all an outoftheway speaking to say such a shipwas built at ipswich any more than it is to say as they do thatthe royal prince the great ship lately built for the south seacompany was london built because she was built at limehouse</s> and why then is not ipswich capable of building and receiving thegreatest ships in the navy seeing they may be built and brought upagain laden within a mile and half of the town</s> but the neighbourhood of london which sucks the vitals of trade inthis island to itself is the chief reason of any decay of businessin this place and i shall in the course of these observationshint at it where many good seaports and large towns thoughfarther off than ipswich and as well fitted for commerce are yetswallowed up by the immense indraft of trade to the city of londonand more decayed beyond all comparison than ipswich is supposed tobe as southampton weymouth dartmouth and several others whichi shall speak to in their order and if it be otherwise at thistime with some other towns which are lately increased in tradeand navigation wealth and people while their neighbours decayit is because they have some particular trade or accident totrade which is a kind of nostrum to them inseparable to theplace and which fixes there by the nature of the thing as theherringfishery to yarmouth the coal trade to newcastle the leedsclothing trade the export of butter and lead and the great corntrade for holland is to hull the virginia and west india trade atliverpool the irish trade at bristol and the like</s>  thus the warhas brought a flux of business and people and consequently ofwealth to several places as well as to portsmouth chathamplymouth falmouth and others and were any wars like those tocontinue twenty years with the dutch or any nation whose fleetslay that way as the dutch do it would be the like perhaps atipswich in a few years and at other places on the same coast</s> but at this present time an occasion offers to speak in favour ofthis port namely the greenland fishery lately proposed to becarried on by the south sea company</s>  on which account i may freelyadvance this without any compliment to the town of ipswich noplace in britain is equally qualified like ipswich whether werespect the cheapness of building and fitting out their ships andshallops also furnishing victualling and providing them with allkinds of stores convenience for laying up the ships after thevoyage room for erecting their magazines warehouses rope walkscooperages etc</s>  on the easiest terms and especially for thenoisome cookery which attends the boiling their blubber which maybe on this river as it ought to be remote from any places ofresort</s>  then their nearness to the market for the oil when it ismade and which above all ought to be the chief thing consideredin that trade the easiness of their putting out to sea when theybegin their voyage in which the same wind that carries them fromthe mouth of the haven is fair to the very seas of greenland</s> i could say much more to this point if it were needful and in fewwords could easily prove that ipswich must have the preference ofall the port towns of britain for being the best centre of thegreenland trade if ever that trade fall into the management ofsuch a people as perfectly understand and have a due honest regardto its being managed with the best husbandry and to the prosperityof the undertaking in general</s>  but whether we shall ever arrive atso happy a time as to recover so useful a trade to our countrywhich our ancestors had the honour to be the first undertakers ofand which has been lost only through the indolence of others andthe increasing vigilance of our neighbours that is not my businesshere to dispute</s> what i have said is only to let the world see what improvement thistown and port is capable of i cannot think but that providencewhich made nothing in vain cannot have reserved so useful soconvenient a port to lie vacant in the world but that the timewill some time or other come especially considering the improvingtemper of the present age when some peculiar beneficial businessmay be found out to make the port of ipswich as useful to theworld and the town as flourishing as nature has made it properand capable to be</s> as for the town it is true it is but thinly inhabited incomparison of the extent of it but to say there are hardly anypeople to be seen there is far from being true in fact andwhoever thinks fit to look into the churches and meetinghouses ona sunday or other public days will find there are very greatnumbers of people there</s>  or if he thinks fit to view the marketand see how the large shambles called cardinal wolseys butcheryare furnished with meat and the rest of the market stocked withother provisions must acknowledge that it is not for a few peoplethat all those things are provided</s>  a person very curious and onwhose veracity i think i may depend going through the market inthis town told me that he reckoned upwards of six hundred countrypeople on horseback and on foot with baskets and other carriagewho had all of them brought something or other to town to sellbesides the butchers and what came in carts and waggons</s> it happened to be my lot to be once at this town at the time when avery fine new ship which was built there for some merchants oflondon was to be launched and if i may give my guess at thenumbers of people which appeared on the shore in the houses andon the river i believe i am much within compass if i say therewere 20000 people to see it but this is only a guess or theymight come a great way to see the sight or the town may bedeclined farther since that</s>  but a view of the town is one of thesurest rules for a gross estimate</s> it is true here is no settled manufacture</s>  the french refugeeswhen they first came over to england began a little to take to thisplace and some merchants attempted to set up a linen manufacturein their favour but it has not met with so much success as wasexpected and at present i find very little of it</s>  the poor peopleare however employed as they are all over these counties inspinning wool for other towns where manufactures are settled</s> the country round ipswich as are all the counties so near thecoast is applied chiefly to corn of which a very great quantityis continually shipped off for london and sometimes they load cornhere for holland especially if the market abroad is encouraging</s> they have twelve parish churches in this town with three or fourmeetings but there are not so many quakers here as at colchesterand no anabaptists or antipoedo baptists that i could hear ofatleast there is no meetinghouse of that denomination</s>  there isone meetinghouse for the presbyterians one for the independentsand one for the quakers the first is as large and as fine abuilding of that kind as most on this side of england and theinside the best finished of any i have seen london not exceptedthat for the independents is a handsome newbuilt building but notso gay or so large as the other</s> there is a great deal of very good company in this town and thoughthere are not so many of the gentry here as at bury yet there aremore here than in any other town in the county and i observedparticularly that the company you meet with here are generallypersons well informed of the world and who have something verysolid and entertaining in their society</s>  this may happen perhapsby their frequent conversing with those who have been abroad andby their having a remnant of gentlemen and masters of ships amongthem who have seen more of the world than the people of an inlandtown are likely to have seen</s>  i take this town to be one

toaccommodate the town for building of ships is an inexhaustiblestorehouse of timber of which now their trade of building shipsis abated they send very great quantities to the kings buildingyards at chatham which by water is so little a way that they oftenrun to it from the mouth of the river at harwich in one tide</s> from ipswich i took a turn into the country to hadleighprincipally to satisfy

 that theladies round the country appear mighty gay and agreeable at thetime of the fair in this town i acknowledge one hardly sees such ashow in any part of the world but to suggest they come hither asto a market is so coarse a jest that the gentlemen that wait onthem hither for they rarely come but in good company ought toresent and correct him for it</s> it is true bury fair like bartholomew fair is a fair fordiversion more than for trade and it may be a fair for toys andfor trinkets which the ladies may think fit to lay out some oftheir money in as they see occasion</s>  but to judge from thencethat the knights daughters of norfolk cambridgeshire andsuffolkthat is to say for it cannot be understood any otherwisethe daughters of all the gentry of the three countiescome hitherto be picked up is a way of speaking i never before heard anyauthor have the assurance to make use of in print</s> the assembly he justly commends for the bright appearance of thebeauties but with a sting in the tail of this compliment where hesays they seldom end without some considerable match or intrigueand yet he owns that during the fair these assemblies are heldevery night</s>  now that these fine ladies go intriguing every nightand that too after the comedy is done which is after the fair andraffling is over for the day so that it must be very late</s>  thisis a terrible character for the ladies of bury and intimates inshort that most of them are loose women which is a horrid abuseupon the whole country</s> now though i like not the assemblies at all and shall in anotherplace give them something of their due yet having the opportunityto see the fair at bury and to see that there were indeedabundance of the finest ladies or as fine as any in britain yet imust own the number of the ladies at the comedy or at theassembly is no way equal to the number that are seen in the townmuch less are they equal to the whole body of the ladies in thethree counties and i must also add that though it is far fromtrue that all that appear at the assembly are there for matches orintrigues yet i will venture to say that they are not the worst ofthe ladies who stay away neither are they the fewest in number orthe meanest in beauty but just the contrary and i do not at alldoubt but that the scandalous liberty some take at thoseassemblies will in time bring them out of credit with the virtuouspart of the sex here as it has done already in kent and otherplaces and that those ladies who most value their reputation willbe seen less there than they have been for though the institutionof them has been innocent and virtuous the ill use of them andthe scandalous behaviour of some people at them will in time armvirtue against them and they will be laid down as they have beenset up without much satisfaction</s>
but the beauty of this town consists in the number of gentry whodwell in and near it the polite conversation among them theaffluence and plenty they live in the sweet air they breathe inand the pleasant country they have to go abroad in</s> here is no manufacturing in this town or but very little exceptspinning the chief trade of the place depending upon the gentrywho live there or near it and who cannot fail to cause tradeenough by the expense of their families and equipages among thepeople of a county town</s>  they have but a very small river orrather but a very small branch of a small river at this townwhich runs from hence to milden hall on the edge of the fens</s> however the town and gentlemen about have been at the charge orhave so encouraged the engineer who was at the charge that theyhave made this river navigable to the said milden hall from whencethere is a navigable dyke called milden hall drain which goesinto the river ouse and so to lynn so that all their coal andwine iron lead and other heavy goods are brought by water fromlynn or from london by the way of lynn to the great ease of thetradesmen</s> this town is famous for two great events</s>  one was that in the year1447 in the 25th year of henry vi</s>  a parliament was held here</s> the other was that at the meeting of this parliament the greathumphrey duke of gloucester regent of the kingdom during theabsence of king henry v</s>  and the minority of henry vi</s>  and to hislast hour the safeguard of the whole nation and darling of thepeople was basely murdered here by whose death the gate wasopened to that dreadful war between the houses of lancaster andyork which ended in the confusion of that very race who aresupposed to have contrived that murder</s> from st</s>  edmunds bury i returned by stowmarket and needham toipswich that i might keep as near the coast as was proper to mydesigned circuit or journey and from ipswich to visit the seaagain i went to woodbridge and from thence to orford on the seaside</s> woodbridge has nothing remarkable but that it is a considerablemarket for butter and corn to be exported to london for now beginsthat part which is ordinarily called high suffolk which being arich soil is for a long tract of ground wholly employed indairies and they again famous for the best butter and perhaps theworst cheese in england</s>  the butter is barrelled or oftenpickled up in small casks and sold not in london only but i haveknown a firkin of suffolk butter sent to the west indies andbrought back to england again and has been perfectly good andsweet as at first</s> the port for the shipping off their suffolk butter is chieflywoodbridge which for that reason is full of corn factors andbutter factors some of whom are very considerable merchants</s> from hence turning down to the shore we see orfordness a notedpoint of land for the guide of the colliers and coasters and agood shelter for them to ride under when a strong northeast windblows and makes a foul shore on the coast</s> south of the ness is orford haven being the mouth of two littlerivers meeting together</s>  it is a very good harbour for smallvessels but not capable of receiving a ship of burden</s> orford was once a good town but is decayed and as it stands onthe land side of the river the sea daily throws up more land to itand falls off itself from it as if it was resolved to disown theplace and that it should be a seaport no longer</s> a little farther lies aldborough as thriving though without aport as the other is decaying with a good river in the front ofit</s> there are some gentlemens seats up farther from the sea but veryfew upon the coast</s> from aldborough to dunwich there are no towns of note even thistown seems to be in danger of being swallowed up for fame reportsthat once they had fifty churches in the town i saw but one leftand that not half full of people</s> this town is a testimony of the decay of public things things ofthe most durable nature and as the old poet expresses itby numerous examples we may seethat towns and cities die as well as we</s> the ruins of carthage of the great city of jerusalem or ofancient rome are not at all wonderful to me</s>  the ruins ofnineveh which are so entirety sunk as that it is doubtful wherethe city stood the ruins of babylon or the great persepolis andmany capital cities which time and the change of monarchies haveoverthrown these i say are not at all wonderful because beingthe capitals of great and flourishing kingdoms where thosekingdoms were overthrown the capital cities necessarily fell withthem but for a private town a seaport and a town of commerce todecay as it were of itself for we never read of dunwich beingplundered or ruined by any disaster at least not of late yearsthis i must confess seems owing to nothing but to the fate ofthings by which we see that towns kings countries families andpersons have all their elevation their medium their declinationand even their destruction in the womb of time and the course ofnature</s>  it is true this town is manifestly decayed by theinvasion of the waters and as other towns seem sufferers by thesea or the tide withdrawing from their ports such as orford justnow named winchelsea in kent and the like so this town is as itwere eaten up by the sea as above and the still encroachingocean seems to threaten it with a fatal immersion in a few yearsmore</s> yet dunwich however ruined retains some share of trade asparticularly for the shipping of butter cheese and corn which isso great a business in this county that it employs a great manypeople and ships also and this port lies right against theparticular part of the county for butter as framlingham halsteadetc</s>  also a very great quantity of corn is bought up hereabout forthe london market for i shall still touch that point how all thecounties in england contribute something towards the subsistence ofthe great city of london of which the butter here is a veryconsiderable article as also coarse cheese which i mentionedbefore used chiefly for the kings ships</s> hereabouts they begin to talk of herrings and the fishery and wefind in the ancient records that this town which was then equal toa large city paid among other tribute to the government fiftythousand of herrings</s>  here also and at swole or southole thenext seaport they cure sprats in the same manner as they doherrings at yarmouth that is to say speaking in their ownlanguage they make red sprats or to speak good english they makesprats red</s> it is remarkable that this town is now so much washed away by thesea that what little trade they have is carried on by walderswicka little town near swole the vessels coming in there because theruins of dunwich make the shore there unsafe and uneasy to theboats from whence the northern coasting seamen a rude verse oftheir own using and i suppose of their own making as followsswoul and dunwich and walderswickall go in at one lousie creek</s> this lousie creek in short is a little river at swoul whichour late famous atlasmaker calls a good harbour for ships andrendezvous of the royal navy but that bythebye the author itseems knew no better</s> from dunwich we came to southwold the town abovenamed this is asmall port town upon the coast at the mouth of a little rivercalled the blith</s>  i found no business the people here wereemployed in but the fishery as above for herrings and spratswhich they cure by the help of smoke as they do at yarmouth</s> there is but one church in this town but it is a very large oneand well built as most of the churches in this county are and ofimpenetrable flint indeed there is no occasion for its being solarge for staying there one sabbath day i was surprised to see anextraordinary large church capable of receiving five or sixthousand people and but twentyseven in it besides the parson andthe clerk but at the same time the meetinghouse of the dissenterswas full to the very doors having as i guessed from six to eighthundred people in it</s> this town is made famous for a very great engagement at sea in theyear 1672 between the english and dutch fleets in the bayopposite to the town in which not to be partial to ourselves theenglish fleet was worsted and the brave montague earl ofsandwich admiral under the duke of york lost his life</s>
 the shiproyal prince carrying one hundred guns in which he was and whichwas under him commanded by sir edward spragg was burnt andseveral other ships lost and about six hundred seamen part ofthose killed in the fight were as i was told brought on shorehere and buried in the churchyard of this town as others also wereat ipswich</s> at this town in particular and so at all the towns on this coastfrom orfordness to yarmouth is the ordinary place where our summerfriends the swallows first land when they come to visit us andhere they may be said to embark for their return when they go backinto warmer climates and as i think the following remark thoughof so trifling a circumstance may be both instructing as well asdiverting it may be very proper in this place</s>  the case is thisi was some years before at this place at the latter end of theyear viz</s>  about the beginning of october and lodging in a housethat looked into the churchyard i observed in the evening anunusual multitude of birds sitting on the leads of the church</s> curiosity led me to go nearer to see what they were and i foundthey were all swallows that there was such an infinite number thatthey covered the whole roof of the church and of several housesnear and perhaps might of more houses which i did not see</s>  thisled me to inquire of a grave gentleman whom i saw near me what themeaning was of such a prodigious multitude of swallows sittingthere</s>  oh sir says he turning towards the sea you may seethe reason the wind is off sea</s>  i did not seem fully informed bythat expression so he goes on i perceive sir says he youare a stranger to it you must then understand first that this isthe season of the year when the swallows their food here failingbegin to leave us and return to the country wherever it be fromwhence i suppose they came and this being the nearest to the coastof holland they come here to embark this he said smiling alittle and now sir says he the weather being too calm orthe wind contrary they are waiting for a gale for they are allwindbound</s> this was more evident to me when in the morning i found the windhad come about to the northwest in the night and there was notone swallow to be seen of near a million which i believe was therethe night before</s> how those creatures know that this part of the island of greatbritain is the way to their home or the way that they are to gothat this very point is the nearest cut over or even that thenearest cut is best for them that we must leave to the naturaliststo determine who insist upon it that brutes cannot think</s> certain it is that the swallows neither come hither for warmweather nor retire from cold the thing is of quite another nature</s> they like the shoals of fish in the sea pursue their prey theyare a voracious creature they feed flying their food is found inthe air viz</s>  the insects of which in our summer evenings indamp and moist places the air is full</s>  they come hither in thesummer because our air is fuller of fogs and damps than in othercountries and for that reason feeds great quantities of insects</s> if the air be hot and dry the gnats die of themselves and even theswallows will be found famished for want and fall down dead out ofthe air their food being taken from them</s>  in like manner whencold weather comes in the insects all die and then of necessitythe swallows quit us and follow their food wherever they go</s>  thisthey do in the manner i have mentioned above for sometimes theyare seen to go off in vast flights like a cloud</s>  and sometimesagain when the wind grows fair they go away a few and a few asthey come not staying at all upon the coast</s> note</s> this passing and repassing of the swallows is observednowhere so much that i have heard of or in but few other placesexcept on this eastern coast namely from above harwich to theeast point of norfolk called winterton ness north which is allright against holland</s>  we know nothing of them any farther norththe passage of the sea being as i suppose too broad fromflamborough head and the shore of holderness in yorkshire etc</s> i find very little remarkable on this side of suffolk but what ison the seashore as above</s>  the inland country is that which theyproperly call high suffolk and is full of rich feeding grounds andlarge farms mostly employed in dairies for making the suffolkbutter and cheese of which i have spoken already</s>  among theserich grounds stand some market towns though not of veryconsiderable note such as framlingham where was once a royalcastle to which queen mary retired when the northumberlandfaction in behalf of the lady jane endeavoured to supplant her</s> and it was this part of suffolk where the gospellers as they werethen called preferred their loyalty to their religion andcomplimented the popish line at expense of their share of thereformation</s>  but they paid dear for it and their successors havelearned better politics since</s> in these parts are also several good market towns some in thiscounty and some in the other as beccles bungay harlston etc</s> all on the edge of the river waveney which parts here the countiesof suffolk and norfolk</s>  and here in a byeplace and out of commonremark lies the ancient town of hoxon famous for being the placewhere st</s>  edmund was martyred for whom so many cells and shrineshave been set up and monasteries built and in honour of whom thefamous monastery of st</s>  edmundsbury above mentioned was foundedwhich most people erroneously think was the place where the saidmurder was committed</s> besides the towns mentioned above there are halesworthsaxmundham debenham aye or eye all standing in this easternside of suffolk in which as i have said the whole country isemployed in dairies or in feeding of cattle</s> this part of england is also remarkable for being the first wherethe feeding and fattening of cattle both sheep as well as blackcattle with turnips was first practised in england which is madea very great part of the improvement of their lands to this dayand from whence the practice is spread over most of the east andsouth parts of england to the great enriching of the farmers andincrease of fat cattle</s>  and though some have objected against thegoodness of the flesh thus fed with turnips and have fancied itwould taste of the root yet upon experience it is found that atmarket there is no difference nor can they that buy single out onejoint of mutton from another by the taste</s>  so that the complaintwhich our nice palates at first made begins to cease of itself anda very great quantity of beef and mutton also is brought every yearand every week to london from this side of england and much morethan was formerly known to be fed there</s> i cannot omit however little it may seem that this county ofsuffolk is particularly famous for furnishing the city of londonand all the counties round with turkeys and that it is thoughtthere are more turkeys bred in this county and the part of norfolkthat adjoins to it than in all the rest of england especially forsale though this may be reckoned as i say above but a triflingthing to take notice of in these remarks yet as i have hintedthat i shall observe how london is in general supplied with all itsprovisions from the whole body of the nation and how every part ofthe island is engaged in some degree or other of that supply</s>  onthis account i could not omit it nor will it be found soinconsiderable an article as some may imagine if this be truewhich i received an account of from a person living on the placeviz</s>
 that they have counted three hundred droves of turkeys forthey drive them all in droves on foot pass in one season overstratford bridge on the river stour which parts suffolk fromessex about six miles from colchester on the road from ipswich tolondon</s>  these droves as they say generally contain from threehundred to a thousand each drove so that one may suppose them tocontain five hundred one with another which is one hundred andfifty thousand in all and yet this is one of the least passagesthe numbers which travel by newmarket heath and the open countryand the forest and also the numbers that come by sudbury and clarebeing many more</s> for the further supplies of the markets of london with poultry ofwhich these countries particularly abound they have within thesefew years found it practicable to make the geese travel on foottoo as well as the turkeys and a prodigious number are brought upto london in droves from the farthest parts of norfolk even fromthe fen country about lynn downham wisbech and the washes asalso from all the east side of norfolk and suffolk of whom it isvery frequent now to meet droves with a thousand sometimes twothousand in a drove</s>  they begin to drive them generally in augustby which time the harvest is almost over and the geese may feed inthe stubbles as they go</s>  thus they hold on to the end of octoberwhen the roads begin to be too stiff and deep for their broad feetand short legs to march in</s> besides these methods of driving these creatures on foot they haveof late also invented a new method of carriage being carts formedon purpose with four stories or stages to put the creatures in oneabove another by which invention one cart will carry a very greatnumber and for the smoother going they drive with two horsesabreast like a coach so quartering the road for the ease of thegentry that thus ride</s>  changing horses they travel night and dayso that they bring the fowls seventy eighty or one hundred milesin two days and one night</s>  the horses in this newfashionedvoiture go two abreast as above but no perch below as in acoach but they are fastened together by a piece of wood lyingcrosswise upon their necks by which they are kept even andtogether and the driver sits on the top of the cart like as in thepublic carriages for the army etc</s> in this manner they hurry away the creatures alive and infinitenumbers are thus carried to london every year</s>  this method is alsoparticular for the carrying young turkeys or turkey poults in theirseason which are valuable and yield a good price at market asalso for live chickens in the dear seasons of all which a verygreat number are brought in this manner to london and moreprodigiously out of this country than any other part of englandwhich is the reason of my speaking of it here</s>
in this part which we call high suffolk there are not so manyfamilies of gentry or nobility placed as in the other side of thecountry</s>  but it is observed that though their seats are not sofrequent here their estates are and the pleasure of west suffolkis much of it supported by the wealth of high suffolk for therichness of the lands and application of the people to all kinds ofimprovement is scarce credible also the farmers are so veryconsiderable and their farms and dairies so large that it is veryfrequent for a farmer to have 1000 pounds stock upon his farm incows only</s> norfolkfrom high suffolk i passed the waveney into norfolk near scholeinn</s>  in my passage i saw at redgrave the seat of the family amost exquisite monument of sir john holt knight late lord chiefjustice of the kings bench several years and one of the mosteminent lawyers of his time</s>  one of the heirs of the family is nowbuilding a fine seat about a mile on the south side of ipswichnear the road</s> the epitaph or inscription on this monument is as followsm</s>  s</s> d</s>  johannis holt equitis aur</s>

when we come into norfolk we see a face of diligence spread overthe whole country the vast manufactures carried on in chief bythe norwich weavers employs all the country round in spinning yarnfor them besides many thousand packs of yarn which they receivefrom other countries even from as far as yorkshire andwestmoreland of which i shall speak in its place</s> this side of norfolk is very populous and thronged with great andspacious markettowns more and larger than any other part ofengland so far from london except devonshire and the west ridingof yorkshire for example between the frontiers of suffolk and thecity of norwich on this side which is not above 22 miles inbreadth are the following markettowns viz</s> thetford hingham harlestondiss west dereham e</s>  derehamharling attleborough wattonbucknam windham loddon etc</s> most of these towns are very populous and large but that which ismost remarkable is that the whole country round them is sointerspersed with villages and those villages so large and sofull of people that they are equal to markettowns in othercountries in a word they render this eastern part of norfolkexceeding full of inhabitants</s> an eminent weaver of norwich gave me a scheme of their trade onthis occasion by which calculating from the number of looms atthat time employed in the city of norwich only besides thoseemployed in other towns in the same county he made it appear veryplain that there were 120000 people employed in the woollen andsilk and wool manufactures of that city only not that the peopleall lived in the city though norwich is a very large and populouscity too but i say they were employed for spinning the yarnused for such goods as were all made in that city</s>  this account iscurious enough and very exact but it is too long for the compassof this work</s> this shows the wonderful extent of the norwich manufacture orstuffweaving trade by which so many thousands of families aremaintained</s>  their trade indeed felt a very sensible decay andthe cries of the poor began to be very loud when the wearing ofpainted calicoes was grown to such a height in england as was seenabout two or three years ago but an act of parliament having beenobtained though not without great struggle in the years 1720 and1721 for prohibiting the use and wearing of calicoes the stufftrade revived incredibly and as i passed this part of the countryin the year 1723 the manufacturers assured me that there was notin all the eastern and middle part of norfolk any hand unemployedif they would work and that the very children after four or fiveyears of age could every one earn their own bread</s>  but i returnto speak of the villages and towns in the rest of the county ishall come to the city of norwich by itself</s> this throng of villages continues through all the east part of thecountry which is of the greatest extent and where the manufactureis chiefly carried on</s>  if any part of it be waste and thin ofinhabitants it is the west part drawing a line from about brandor brandon south to walsinghan north</s>  this part of the countryindeed is full of open plains and somewhat sandy and barren andfeeds great flocks of good sheep but put it all together thecounty of norfolk has the most people in the least tract of land ofany county in england except about london and exon and the westriding of yorkshire as above</s> add to this that there is no single county in england except asabove that can boast of three towns so populous so rich and sofamous for trade and navigation as in this county</s>  by these threetowns i mean the city of norwich the towns of yarmouth and lynn</s> besides that it has several other seaports of very good trade aswisbech wells burnham clye etc</s> norwich is the capital of all the county and the centre of all thetrade and manufactures which i have just mentioned an ancientlarge rich and populous city</s>  if a stranger was only to ridethrough or view the city of norwich for a day he would have muchmore reason to think there was a town without inhabitants thanthere is really to say so of ipswich but on the contrary if he wasto view the city either on a sabbathday or on any publicoccasion he would wonder where all the people could dwell themultitude is so great</s>  but the case is this the inhabitantsbeing all busy at their manufactures dwell in their garrets attheir looms and in their combing shops so they call themtwistingmills and other workhouses almost all the works theyare employed in being done within doors</s>  there are in this citythirtytwo parishes besides the cathedral and a great manymeetinghouses of dissenters of all denominations</s>  the publicedifices are chiefly the castle ancient and decayed and now formany years past made use of for a gaol</s>  the duke of norfolkshouse was formerly kept well and the gardens preserved for thepleasure and diversion of the citizens but since feeling toosensibly the sinking circumstances of that once glorious familywho were the first peers and hereditary earlmarshals of england</s> the walls of this city are reckoned three miles in circumferencetaking in more ground than the city of london but much of thatground lying open in pasturefields and gardens nor does it seemto be like some ancient places a decayed declining town andthat the walls mark out its ancient dimensions for we do not seeroom to suppose that it was ever larger or more populous than it isnow</s>  but the walls seem to be placed as if they expected that thecity would in time increase sufficiently to fill them up withbuildings</s> the cathedral of this city is a fine fabric and the spire steeplevery high and beautiful</s>  it is not ancient the bishops seehaving been first at thetford from whence it was not translatedhither till the twelfth century</s>  yet the church has so manyantiquities in it that our late great scholar and physician sirthomas brown thought it worth his while to write a whole book tocollect the monuments and inscriptions in this church to which irefer the reader</s> the river yare runs through this city and is navigable thus farwithout the help of any art that is to say without locks orstops and being increased by other waters passes afterwardsthrough a long tract of the richest meadows and the largest takethem all together that are anywhere in england lying for thirtymiles in length from this city to yarmouth including the returnof the said meadows on the bank of the waveney south and on theriver thyrn north</s> here is one thing indeed strange in itself and more so in thathistory seems to be quite ignorant of the occasion of it</s>  theriver waveney is a considerable river and of a deep and fullchannel navigable for large barges as high as beccles it runs fora course of about fifty miles between the two counties of suffolkand norfolk as a boundary to both and pushing on though with agentle stream towards the sea no one would doubt but that whenthey see the river growing broader and deeper and going directlytowards the sea even to the edge of the beachthat is to saywithin a mile of the main oceanno stranger i say but wouldexpect to see its entrance into the sea at that place and a nobleharbour for ships at the mouth of it when on a sudden the landrising high by the seaside crosses the head of the river like adam checks the whole course of it and it returns bending itscourse west for two miles or thereabouts and then turning norththrough another long course of meadows joining to those just nowmentioned seeks out the river yare that it may join its waterwith hers and find their way to the sea togethersome of our historians tell a long fabulous story of this riverbeing once open and a famous harbour for ships belonging to a townof lowestoft adjoining but that the town of yarmouth envying theprosperity of the said town of lowestoft made war upon them andthat after many bloody battles as well by sea as by land theycame at last to a decisive action at sea with their respectivefleets and the victory fell to the yarmouth men the lowestoftfleet being overthrown and utterly destroyed and that upon thisvictory the yarmouth men either actually did stop up the mouth ofthe said river or obliged the vanquished lowestoft men to do itthemselves and bound them never to attempt to open it again</s> i believe my share of this story and i recommend no more of it tothe reader adding that i see no authority for the relationneither do the relators agree either in the time of it or in theparticulars of the fact that is to say in whose reign or underwhat government all this happened in what year and the like so isatisfy myself with transcribing the matter of fact and then leaveit as i find it</s> in this vast tract of meadows are fed a prodigious number of blackcattle which are said to be fed up for the fattest beef though notthe largest in england and the quantity is so great as that theynot only supply the city of norwich the town of yarmouth andcounty adjacent but send great quantities of them weekly in allthe winter season to london</s> and this in particular is worthy remark that the gross of all thescots cattle which come yearly into england are brought hitherbeing brought to a small village lying north of the city ofnorwich called st</s>  faiths where the norfolk graziers go and buythem</s> these scots runts so they call them coming out of the cold andbarren mountains of the highlands in scotland feed so eagerly onthe rich pasture in these marshes that they thrive in an unusualmanner and grow monstrously fat and the beef is so delicious fortaste that the inhabitants prefer them to the english cattlewhich are much larger and fairer to look at and they may very welldo so</s>  some have told me and i believe with good judgment thatthere are above forty thousand of these scots cattle fed in thiscounty every year and most of them in the said marshes betweennorwich beccles and yarmouth</s> yarmouth is an ancient town much older than norwich and atpresent though not standing on so much ground yet better builtmuch more complete for number of inhabitants not much inferiorand for wealth trade and advantage of its situation infinitelysuperior to norwich</s> it is placed on a peninsula between the river yare and the sea thetwo last lying parallel to one another and the town in the middle</s> the river lies on the west side of the town and being grown verylarge and deep by a conflux of all the rivers on this side thecounty forms the haven and the town facing to the west also andopen to the river makes the finest quay in england if not ineurope not inferior even to that of marseilles itself</s> the ships ride here so close and as it were keeping up oneanother with their headfasts on shore that for half a miletogether they go across the stream with their bowsprits over theland their bows or heads touching the very wharf so that one maywalk from ship to ship as on a floating bridge all along by theshoreside</s>  the quay reaching from the drawbridge almost to thesouth gate is so spacious and wide that in some places it is nearone hundred yards from the houses to the wharf</s>  in this pleasantand agreeable range of houses are some very magnificent buildingsand among the rest the custom house and town hall and somemerchants houses which look like little palaces rather than thedwellinghouses of private men</s> the greatest defect of this beautiful town seems to be that thoughit is very rich and increasing in wealth and trade andconsequently in people there is not room to enlarge the town bybuilding which would be certainly done much more than it is butthat the river on the land side prescribes them except at thenorth end without the gate and even there the land is not veryagreeable</s>  but had they had a larger space within the gates therewould before now have been many spacious streets of noble finebuildings erected as we see is done in some other thriving townsin england as at liverpool manchester bristol frome etc</s> the quay and the harbour of this town during the fishing fair asthey call it which is every michaelmas one sees the land coveredwith people and the river with barques and boats busy day andnight landing and carrying of the herrings which they catch herein such prodigious quantities that it is incredible</s>  i happenedto be there during their fishing fair when i told in one tide 110barques and fishing vessels coming up the river all laden withherrings and all taken the night before and this was besides whatwas brought on shore on the dean that is the seaside of the townby open boats which they call cobles and which often bring in twoor three last of fish at a time</s>  the barques often bring in tenlast a piece</s> this fishing fair begins on michaelmas day and lasts all the monthof october by which time the herrings draw off to sea shoot theirspawn and are no more fit for the merchants businessat leastnot those that are taken thereabouts</s> the quantity of herrings that are caught in this season arediversely accounted for</s>  some have said that the towns of yarmouthand lowestoft only have taken 40000 last in a season</s>  i will notventure to confirm that report but this i have heard the merchantsthemselves say viz</s>  that they have curedthat is to say hangedand dried in the smoke40000 barrels of merchantable red herringsin one season which is in itself though far short of the otheryet a very considerable article and it is to be added that this isbesides all the herrings consumed in the country towns of boththose populous counties for thirty miles from the sea whither verygreat quantities are carried every tide during the whole season</s> but this is only one branch of the great trade carried on in thistown</s>  another part of this commerce is in the exporting theseherrings after they are cured and for this their merchants have agreat trade to genoa

manufactures of the neighbouring city ofnorwich and of the places adjacent</s> besides this they carry on a very considerable trade with hollandwhose opposite neighbours they are and a vast quantity of woollenmanufactures they export to the dutch every year</s>  also they have afishing trade to the north seas for white fish which from theplace are called the north sea cod</s> they have also a considerable trade to norway and to the balticfrom whence they bring back deals and fir timber oaken plankbalks spars oars pitch tar hemp flax spruce canvas andsailcloth with all manner of naval stores which they generallyhave a consumption for in their own port where they build a verygreat number of ships every year besides refitting and repairingthe old</s> add to this the coal trade between newcastle and the river ofthames in which they are so improved of late years that they havenow a greater share of it than any other town in england and havequite worked the ipswich men out of it who had formerly the chiefshare of the colliery in their hands</s> for the carrying on all these trades they must have a very greatnumber of ships either of their own or employed by them and itmay in some measure be judged of by this that in the year 1697 ihad an account from the town register that there was then 1123sail of ships using the sea and belonged to the town besides suchships as the merchants of yarmouth might be concerned in and bepart owners of belonging to any other ports</s> to all this i must add without compliment to the town or to thepeople that the merchants and even the generality of traders ofyarmouth have a very good reputation in trade as well abroad as athome for men of fair and honourable dealing punctual and just intheir performing their engagements and in discharging commissionsand their seamen as well masters as mariners are justly esteemedamong the ablest and most expert navigators in england</s> this town however populous and large was ever contained in oneparish and had but one church but within these two years theyhave built another very fine church near the south end of the town</s> the old church is dedicated to st</s>  nicholas and was built by thatfamous bishop of norwich william herbert who flourished in thereign of william ii</s>  and henry i</s>  william of malmesbury callshim vir pecuniosus he might have called him vir

episcopal seefrom thetford to norwich and instituted the cluniack monks atthetford and gave them or built them a house</s>  this old church isvery large and has a high spire which is a useful seamark</s> here is one of the finest marketplaces and the best served withprovisions in england london excepted and the inhabitants are somultiplied in a few years that they seem to want room in their townrather than people to fill it as i have observed above</s> the streets are all exactly straight from north to south withlanes or alleys which they call rows crossing them in straightlines also from east to west so that it is the most regular builttown in england and seems to have been built all at once or thatthe dimensions of the houses and extent of the streets were laidout by consent</s> they have particular privileges in this town and a jurisdiction bywhich they can try condemn and execute in especial cases withoutwaiting for a warrant from above and this they exerted once verysmartly in executing a captain of one of the kings ships of war inthe reign of king charles ii</s>  for a murder committed in the streetthe circumstance of which did indeed call for justice but somethought they would not have ventured to exert their powers as theydid</s>  however i never heard that the government resented it orblamed them for it</s> it is also a very wellgoverned town and i have nowhere in englandobserved the sabbath day so exactly kept or the breach socontinually punished as in this place which i name to theirhonour</s>
among all these regularities it is no wonder if we do not findabundance of revelling or that there is little encouragement toassemblies plays and gaming meetings at yarmouth as in some otherplaces and yet i do not see that the ladies here come behind anyof the neighbouring counties either in beauty breeding orbehaviour to which may be added too not at all to theirdisadvantage that they generally go beyond them in fortunes</s> from yarmouth i resolved to pursue my first design viz</s>  to viewthe seaside on this coast which is particularly famous for beingone of the most dangerous and most fatal to the sailors in allenglandi may say in all britainand the more so because of thegreat number of ships which are continually going and coming thisway in their passage between london and all the northern coasts ofgreat britain</s>  matters of antiquity are not my inquiry butprincipally observations on the present state of things and ifpossible to give such accounts of things worthy of recording ashave never been observed before and this leads me the moredirectly to mention the commerce and the navigation when i come totowns upon the coast as what few writers have yet meddled with</s> the reason of the dangers of this particular coast are found in thesituation of the county and in the course of ships sailing thisway which i shall describe as well as i can thus the shore fromthe mouth of the river of thames to yarmouth roads lies in astraight line from sse</s>  to nnw</s>  the land being on the w</s>  orlarboard side</s> from wintertonness which is the utmost northerly point of land inthe county of norfolk and about four miles beyond yarmouth theshore falls off for nearly sixty miles to the west as far as lynnand boston till the shore of lincolnshire tends north again forabout sixty miles more as far as the humber whence the coast ofyorkshire or holderness which is the east riding shoots outagain into the sea to the spurn and to flamborough head as fareast almost as the shore of norfolk had given back at wintertonmaking a very deep gulf or bay between those two points ofwinterton and the spurn head so that the ships going north areobliged to stretch away to sea from wintertonness and leaving thesight of land in that deep bay which i have mentioned that reachesto lynn and the shore of lincolnshire they go i say n</s>  or stillnnw</s>  to meet the shore of holderness which i said runs out intothe sea again at the spurn and the first land they make or desireto make is called as above flamborough head so thatwintertonness and flamborough head are the two extremes of thiscourse there is as i said the spurn head indeed between but asit lies too far in towards the humber they keep out to the northto avoid coming near it</s> in like manner the ships which come from the north leave the shoreat flamborough head and stretch away sse</s>  for yarmouth roads andthey first land they make is wintertonness as above</s>  now thedanger of the place is this if the ships coming from the northare taken with a hard gale of wind from the se</s>  or from any pointbetween ne</s>  and se</s>  so that they cannot as the seamen call itweather wintertonness they are thereby kept within that deep bayand if the wind blows hard are often in danger of running on shoreupon the rocks about cromer on the north coast of norfolk orstranding upon the flat shore between cromer and wells all therelief they have is good ground tackle to ride it out which isvery hard to do there the sea coming very high upon them or ifthey cannot ride it out then to run into the bottom of the greatbay i mentioned to lynn or boston which is a very difficult anddesperate push so that sometimes in this distress whole fleetshave been lost here altogether</s> the like is the danger to ships going northward if after passingby winterton they are taken short with a northeast wind andcannot put back into the roads which very often happens then theyare driven upon the same coast and embayed just as the latter</s> the danger on the north part of this bay is not the same becauseif ships going or coming should be taken short on this sideflamborough there is the river humber open to them and severalgood roads to have recourse to as burlington bay grimsby roadand the spurn head and others where they ride under shelter</s> the dangers of this place being thus considered it is no wonderthat upon the shore beyond yarmouth there are no less than fourlighthouses kept flaming every night besides the lights at castornorth of the town and at goulston s</s>  all of which are to directthe sailors to keep a good offing in case of bad weather and toprevent their running into cromer bay which the seamen call thedevils throat</s> as i went by land from yarmouth northward along the shore towardscromer aforesaid and was not then fully master of the reason ofthese things i was surprised to see in all the way fromwinterton that the farmers and country people had scarce a barnor a shed or a stable nay not the pales of their yards andgardens not a hogstye not a necessary house but what was builtof old planks beams wales and timbers etc</s>  the wrecks ofships

in time and got safe into the roads but the restpushing on in hopes to keep out to sea and weather it were by theviolence of the storm driven back when they were too far embayedto weather wintertonness as above and so were forced to run westeveryone shifting for themselves as well as they could some runaway for lynn deeps but few of them the night being so darkcould find their way in there some but very few rode it out at adistance the rest being above 140 sail were all driven on shoreand dashed to pieces and very few of the people on board weresaved at the very same unhappy juncture a fleet of laden shipswere coming from the north and being just crossing the same baywere forcibly driven into it not able to weather the ness and sowere involved in the same ruin as the light fleet was also somecoasting vessels laden with corn from lynn and wells and bound forholland were with the same unhappy luck just come out to begintheir voyage and some of them lay at anchor these also met withthe same misfortune so that in the whole above 200 sail ofships and above a thousand people perished in the disaster ofthat one miserable night very few escaping</s> cromer is a market town close to the shore of this dangerous coast</s> i know nothing it is famous for besides it being thus the terrorof the sailors except good lobsters which are taken on that coastin great

with an exception only to the town of chelmsfordin essex and there are very few planted anywhere else</s> there are indeed in the west of england some quantities growingas at wilton near salisbury at hereford and broomsgrove nearwales and the like but the quantity is inconsiderable and theplaces remote so that none of them come to london</s> as to the north of england they formerly used but few hops theretheir drink being chiefly pale smooth ale which required no hopsand consequently they planted no hops in all that part of englandnorth of the trent nor did i ever see one acre of hopgroundplanted beyond trent in my observation but as for some years pastthey not only brew great quantities of beer in the north but alsouse hops in the brewing their ale much more than they did beforeso they all come south of trent to buy their hops and here beingquantities brought it is great part of their back carriage intoyorkshire and northamptonshire derbyshire lancashire and allthese counties nay of late since the union even to scotlanditself for i must not omit here also to mention that the rivergrant or cam which runs close by the northwest side of the fairin its way from cambridge to ely is navigable and that by thismeans all heavy goods are brought even to the fairfield by watercarriage from london and other parts first to the port of lynnand then in barges up the ouse from the ouse into the cam and soas i say to the very edge of the fair</s> in like manner great quantities of heavy goods and the hops amongthe rest are sent from the fair to lynn by water and shippedthere for the humber to hull york etc</s>  and for newcastleupontyne and by newcastle even to scotland itself</s>  now as there isstill no planting of hops in the north though a great consumptionand the consumption increasing daily this says my friend is onereason why at stourbridge fair there is so great a demand for thehops</s>  he added that besides this there were very few hops ifany worth naming growing in all the counties even on this sidetrent which were above forty miles from london those countiesdepending on stourbridge fair for their supply so the counties ofsuffolk norfolk cambridge huntingdon northampton lincolnleicester rutland and even to stafford warwick andworcestershire bought most if not all of their hops at stourbridgefair</s> these are the reasons why so great a quantity of hops are seen atthis fair as that it is incredible considering too how remotefrom this fair the growth of them is as above</s> this is likewise a testimony of the prodigious resort of thetrading people of all parts of england to this fair the quantityof hops that have been sold at one of these fairs is diverselyreported and some affirm it to be so great that i dare not copyafter them but without doubt it is a surprising accountespecially in a cheap year</s> the next article brought thither is wool and this of severalsorts but principally fleece wool out of lincolnshire where thelongest staple is found the sheep of those countries being of thelargest breed</s> the buyers of this wool are chiefly indeed the manufacturers ofnorfolk and suffolk and essex and it is a prodigious quantity theybuy</s> here i saw what i have not observed in any other county of englandnamely a pocket of wool</s>  this seems to be first called so inmockery this pocket being so big that it loads a whole waggonand reaches beyond the most extreme parts of it hanging over bothbefore and behind and these ordinarily weigh a ton or twentyfivehundredweight of wool all in one bag</s> the quantity of wool only which has been sold at this place at onefair has been said to amount to fifty or sixty thousand pounds invalue some say a great deal more</s> by these articles a stranger may make some guess at the immensetrade carried on at this place what prodigious quantities of goodsare bought and sold here and what a confluence of people are seenhere from all parts of england</s> i might go on here to speak of several other sorts of englishmanufactures which are brought hither to be sold as all sorts ofwroughtiron and brassware from birmingham edged tools knivesetc</s>  from sheffield glass wares and stockings from nottingham andleicester and an infinite throng of other things of smaller valueevery morning</s> to attend this fair and the prodigious conflux of people whichcome to it there are sometimes no less than fifty hackney coacheswhich come from london and ply night and morning to carry thepeople to and from cambridge for there the gross of the peoplelodge nay which is still more strange there are wherries broughtfrom london on waggons to ply upon the little river cam and to rowpeople up and down from the town and from the fair as occasionpresents</s> it is not to be wondered at if the town of cambridge cannotreceive or entertain the numbers of people that come to this fairnot cambridge only but all the towns round are full nay the verybarns and stables are turned into inns and made as fit as they canto lodge the meaner sort of people as for the people in the fairthey all universally eat drink and sleep in their booths andtents and the said booths are so intermingled with tavernscoffeehouses drinkinghouses eatinghouses cookshops etc</s> and all in tents too and so many butchers and higglers from allthe neighbouring counties come into the fair every morning withbeef mutton fowls butter bread cheese eggs and such thingsand go with them from tent to tent from door to door that thereis no want of any provisions of any kind either dressed orundressed</s> in a word the fair is like a wellfortified city and there is theleast disorder and confusion i believe that can be seen anywherewith so great a concourse of people</s> towards the latter end of the fair and when the great hurry ofwholesale business begins to be over the gentry come in from allparts of the county round and though they come for theirdiversion yet it is not a little money they lay out whichgenerally falls to the share of the retailers such as toyshopsgoldsmiths braziers ironmongers turners milliners mercersetc</s>  and some loose coins they reserve for the puppet showsdrolls ropedancers and such like of which there is no wantthough not considerable like the rest</s>  the last day of the fair isthe horsefair where the whole is closed with both horse and footraces to divert the meaner sort of people only for nothingconsiderable is offered of that kind</s>  thus ends the whole fairand in less than a week more there is scarce any sign left thatthere has been such a thing there except by the heaps of dung andstraw and other rubbish which is left behind trod into the earthand which is as good as a summers fallow for dunging the land andas i have said above pays the husbandman well for the use of it</s> i should have mentioned that here is a court of justice alwaysopen and held every day in a shed built on purpose in the fairthis is for keeping the peace and deciding controversies inmatters deriving from the business of the fair</s>  the magistrates ofthe town of cambridge are judges in this court as being in theirjurisdiction or they holding it by special privilege here theydetermine matters in a summary way as is practised in those wecall pye powder courts in other places or as a court ofconscience and they have a final authority without appeal</s> i come now to the town and university of cambridge i say the townand university for though they are blended together in thesituation and the colleges halls and houses for literature arepromiscuously scattered up and down among the other parts and someeven among the meanest of the other buildings as magdalene collegeover the bridge is in particular yet they are all incorporatedtogether by the name of the university and are governed apart anddistinct from the town which they are so intermixed with</s> as their authority is distinct from the town so are theirprivileges customs and government they choose representativesor members of parliament for themselves and the town does the likefor themselves also apart</s> the town is governed by a mayor and aldermen the university by achancellor and vicechancellor etc</s>  though their dwellings aremixed and seem a little confused their authority is not so insome cases the vicechancellor may concern himself in the town asin searching houses for the scholars at improper hours removingscandalous women and the like</s> but as the colleges are many and the gentlemen entertained in themare a very great number the trade of the town very much dependsupon them and the tradesmen may justly be said to get their breadby the colleges and this is the surest hold the university may besaid to have of the townsmen and by which they secure thedependence of the town upon them and consequently theirsubmission</s> i remember some years ago a brewer who being very rich and popularin the town and one of their magistrates had in several things somuch opposed the university and insulted their vicechancellor orother heads of houses that in short the university having no otherway to exert themselves and show their resentment they made abyelaw or order among themselves that for the future they wouldnot trade with him and that none of the colleges halls etc</s> would take any more beer of him and what followed</s>  the man indeedbraved it out a while but when he found he could not obtain arevocation of the order he was fain to leave off his brewhouseand if i remember right quitted the town</s> thus i say interest gives them authority and there are abundanceof reasons why the town should not disoblige the university asthere are some also on the other hand why the university shouldnot differ to any extremity with the town nor such is theirprudence do they let any disputes between them run up to anyextremities if they can avoid it</s>  as for society to any man whois a lover of learning or of learned men here is the mostagreeable under heaven nor is there any want of mirth and goodcompany of other kinds but it is to the honour of the universityto say that the governors so well understand their office and thegoverned their duty that here is very little encouragement givento those seminaries of crime the assemblies which are so muchboasted of in other places</s> again as dancing gaming intriguing are the three principalarticles which recommend those assemblies and that generally thetime for carrying on affairs of this kind is the night andsometimes all night a time as unseasonable as scandalous add tothis that the orders of the university admit no such excesses itherefore say as this is the case it is to the honour of thewhole body of the university that no encouragement is given to themhere</s>
as to the antiquity of the university in this town the originalsand founders of the several colleges their revenues lawsgovernment and governors they are so effectually and so largelytreated of by other authors and are so foreign to the familiardesign of these letters that i refer my readers to mr</s>  camdensbritannia and the author of the antiquities of cambridge andother such learned writers by whom they may be fully informed</s> the present vicechancellor is dr</s>  snape formerly master of eatonschool near windsor and famous for his dispute with and evidentadvantage over the late bishop of bangor in the time of hisgovernment the dispute between the university and the master oftrinity college has been brought to a head so as to employ the pensof the learned on both sides but at last prosecuted in a judicialway so as to deprive dr</s>  bentley of all his dignities and officesin the university but the doctor flying to the royal protectionthe university is under a writ of mandamus to show cause why theydo not restore the doctor again to which it seems they demur andthat demur has not that we hear been argued at least when thesesheets were sent to the press</s>
from cambridge the road lies northwest on the edge of the fens tohuntingdon where it joins the great north road</s>  on this side itis all an agreeable corn country as above adorned with severalseats of gentlemen but the chief is the noble house seat ormansion of wimple or wimple hall formerly built at a vast expenseby the late earl of radnor adorned with all the natural beautiesof situation and to which was added all the most exquisitecontrivances which the best heads could invent to make itartificially as well as naturally pleasant</s> however the fate of the radnor family so directing it was boughtwith the whole estate about it by the late duke of newcastle in apartition of whose immense estate it fell to the right honourablethe lord harley son and heirapparent of the present earl ofoxford and mortimer in right of the lady harriet cavendish onlydaughter of the said duke of newcastle who is married to hislordship and brought him this estate and many other sufficient todenominate her the richest heiress in great britain</s> here his lordship resides and has already so recommended himselfto this county as to be by a great majority chosen knight of theshire for the county of cambridge</s> from cambridge my design obliging me and the direct road in partconcurring i came back through the west part of the county ofessex and at saffron walden i saw the ruins of the once largestand most magnificent pile in all this part of englandviz</s>  audleyendbuilt by and decaying with the noble dukes and earls ofsuffolk</s> a little north of this part of the country rises the river stourwhich for a course of fifty miles or more parts the two counties ofsuffolk and essex passing through or near haveril clarecavendish halsted sudbury bowers nayland stretford dedhammanningtree and into the sea at harwich assisting by its watersto make one of the best harbours for shipping that is in greatbritaini mean orwell haven or harwich of which i have spokenlargely already</s> as we came on this side we saw at a distance braintree and bockingtwo towns large rich and populous and made so originally by thebay trade of which i have spoken at large at colchester and whichflourishes still among them</s> the manor of braintree i found descended by purchase to the name ofolmeus the son of a london merchant of the same name making goodwhat i had observed before of the great number of such who havepurchased estates in this county</s> near this town is felsted a small place but noted for a freeschool of an ancient foundation for many years under themastership of the late rev</s>  mr</s>  lydiat and brought by him to themeridian of its reputation</s>  it is now supplied and that veryworthily by the rev</s>  mr</s>  hutchins</s> near to this is the priory of lees a delicious seat of the latedukes of manchester but sold by the present duke to the duchessdowager of bucks his grace the duke of manchester removing to hisyet finer seat of kimbolton in northamptonshire the ancientmansion of the family</s>  from hence keeping the london road i cameto chelmsford mentioned before and ingerstone five miles westwhich i mention again because in the parish church of this townare to be seen the ancient monuments of the noble family of petrewhose seat and large estate lie in the neighbourhood and whosewhole family by a constant series of beneficent actions to thepoor and bounty upon all charitable occasions have gained anaffectionate esteem through all that part of the country such as noprejudice of religion could wear out or perhaps ever may and imust confess i think need not for good and great actions commandour respect let the opinions of the persons be otherwise what theywill</s> from hence we crossed the country to the great forest calledepping forest reaching almost to london</s>  the country on that sideof essex is called the roodings i suppose because there are noless than ten towns almost together called by the name of rodingand is famous for good land good malt and dirty roads the latterindeed in the winter are scarce passable for horse or man</s>  in themidst of this we see chipping onger hatfield broad oak eppingand many forest towns famed as i have said for husbandry and goodmalt but of no other note</s>  on the south side of the county iswaltham abbey the ruins of the abbey remain and though antiquityis not my proper business i could not but observe that kingharold slain in the great battle in sussex against william theconqueror lies buried here his body being begged by his motherthe conqueror allowed it to be carried hither but no monument wasas i can find built for him only a flat gravestone on which wasengraven harold infelix</s> from hence i came over the forest againthat is to say over thelower or western part of it where it is spangled with finevillages and these villages filled with fine seats most of thembuilt by the citizens of london as i observed before but thelustre of them seems to be entirely swallowed up in the magnificentpalace of the lord castlemain whose father sir josiah child asit were prepared it in his life for the design of his son thoughaltogether unforeseen by adding to the advantage of its situationinnumerable rows of trees planted in curious order for avenues andvistas to the house all leading up to the place where the oldhouse stood as to a centre</s> in the place adjoining his lordship while he was yet sir richardchild only and some years before he began the foundation of hisnew house laid out the most delicious as well as most spaciouspieces of ground for gardens that is to be seen in all this part ofengland</s>  the greenhouse is an excellent building fit to entertaina prince it is furnished with stoves and artificial places forheat from an apartment in which is a bagnio and other convenienceswhich render it both useful and pleasant</s>  and these gardens havebeen so the just admiration of the world that it has been thegeneral diversion of the citizens to go out to see them till thecrowds grew too great and his lordship was obliged to restrain hisservants from showing them except on one or two days in a weekonly</s> the house is built since these gardens have been finished</s>  thebuilding is all of portland stone in the front which makes it lookextremely glorious and magnificent at a distance it being theparticular property of that stone except in the streets of londonwhere it is tainted and tinged with the smoke of the city to growwhiter and whiter the longer it stands in the open air</s> as the front of the house opens to a long row of trees reaching tothe great road at leightonstone so the back face or front ifthat be proper respects the gardens and with an easy descentlands you upon the terrace from whence is a most beautifulprospect to the river which is all formed into canals and openingsto answer the views from above and beyond the river the walks andwildernesses go on to such a distance and in such a manner up thehill as they before went down that the sight is lost in the woodsadjoining and it looks all like one planted garden as far as theeye can see</s> i shall cover as much as possible the melancholy part of a storywhich touches too sensibly many if not most of the great andflourishing families in england</s>  pity and matter of grief is it tothink that families by estate able to appear in such a gloriousposture as this should ever be vulnerable by so mean a disaster asthat of stockjobbing</s>  but the general infatuation of the day is aplea for it so that men are not now blamed on that account</s>  southsea was a general possession and if my lord castlemain was woundedby that arrow shot in the dark it was a misfortune</s>  but it is somuch a happiness that it was not a mortal wound as it was to somemen who once seemed as much out of the reach of it</s>  and that blowbe it what it will is not remembered for joy of the escape for wesee this noble family by prudence and management rise out of allthat cloud if it may be allowed such a name and shining in thesame full lustre as before</s> this cannot be said of some other families in this county whosefine parks and newbuilt palaces are fallen under forfeitures andalienations by the misfortunes of the times and by the ruin oftheir masters fortunes in that south sea deluge</s> but i desire to throw a veil over these things as they come in myway it is enough that we write upon them as was written upon kingharolds tomb at waltham abbey infelix and let all the rest sleepamong things that are the fittest to be forgotten</s> from my lord castlemains house and the rest of the fine dwellingson that side of the forest for there are several very good housesat wanstead only that they seem all

seat of mr</s> lethuliers eldest son of the late sir john lethulier of lusumin kent of whose family i shall speak when i come on that side</s> by this turn i came necessarily on to stratford where i
