angry mutterings as he turned and followedby walter fitzurse and the ecclesiastics made his way along thestreet to the principal entrance of the palace</s>  without waitingto watch his departure wulf the saxon page pushed his way throughthe crowd and went off at full speed to carry the message withwhich he had been charged</s> our king is a good king a squarelybuilt manwhose bare armswith the knotted muscles showing through the skin and hands begrimedwith charcoal indicated that he was a smithremarked to a gossipas the little crowd broke up but it is a grievous pity that hewas brought up a

banishment and the norman bishops and nobleshurried across the seas in a panic</s>  for years now the king has leftall matters in the hands of harold and is well content if only hecan fast and pray like any monk and give all his thoughts andtreasure to the building of yonder abbey</s> we want neither a monk nor a norman over us the smith saidroughly still less one who is both norman and monk i would ratherhave a dane like canute who was a strong man and a firm one thanthis king who i doubt not is full of good intentions and is aholy and pious monarch but who is not strong enough for a ruler</s> he leaves it to another to preserve england in peace to keep inorder the great earls of mercia and the north to hold the landagainst harold of norway sweyn and others and above all towatch the normans across the water</s>  a monk is well enough in aconvent but truly tis bad for a country to have a monk as itsking</s> there have been some warloving prelates ulred menas ambitious as any of the great earls and more dangerousbecause they have learning</s> ay there have been great prelates the smith agreed</s>  look atlyfing of worcester to whom next only to godwin the king owed histhrone</s>  he was an englishman first and a bishop afterwards and wasa proof if needed that a man can be a great churchman and a greatpatriot and statesman too</s>  it was he rather than godwin who overcamethe opposition of the danish party and got the witan at last toacquiesce in the choice of london and wessex and to give theirvote to edward</s> well was it he did so</s>  for had he failed we should have had asgreat a struggle in england as when alfred battled against thedanes</s>  we of london and the men of wessex under the great earl werebent upon being ruled by a prince of our own blood</s>  the last twodanish kings had shown us that anything is better than being governedby the northmen</s>  it was lyfing who persuaded the earl of mercia toside with wessex rather than with northumbria but since lyfingwhat great englishman have we had in the church</s>  every bishopricwas granted by edward to norman priests until godwin and his sonsgot the upper hand after their exile</s>  since then most of them havebeen given to germans</s>  it would seem that the king was so set againstenglishmen that only by bringing in foreigners can harold preventall preferment going to normans</s>  but what is the consequence</s>  theysay now that our church is governed from rome whereas beforeedwards time we englishmen did not think of taking our orders fromitaly</s> there will trouble come of it all neighbour</s>  perhaps not so longas edward reigns but at his death</s>  there is but one of the royalrace surviving and he like edward has lived all his life abroad</s> there can be no doubt what the choice of englishmen will be</s>  haroldhas been our real ruler for years</s>  he is wise and politic as wellas brave and a great general</s>  he is our own earl and will assuredlybe chosen</s>  then we shall have trouble with the normans</s>  alreadythey bear themselves as if they were our masters and they will notgive up their hold without a struggle</s>  men say that william theirduke makes no secret of his hope to become master of england inwhich case god help us all</s>  but that wont come as long as haroldlives and englishmen can wield sword and battleaxe</s>  as for myselfi have patched many a norman suit of armour but by st</s>  swithini shall have far more pleasure in marring than i have ever had inmending them</s> know you who were the boys who had that contention just now</s> the norman is a page of william our norman bishop i know no moreof him than that the other is wulf who is a ward and page of earlharold</s>  his father was thane of steyning in south sussex one ofgodwins men and at his death two years ago harold took the ladinto his household for he bore great affection for gyrth who hadaccompanied him in his pilgrimage to rome and fought by his sidewhen he conquered the welsh</s>  it was there gyrth got the wound thatat last brought about his death</s>  wulf has been to my smithy manytimes sometimes about matters of repairs to arms but more ofteni think to see my son osgod</s>  he had seen him once or twice incalling at the shop when one day osgod who is somewhat given tomischief was playing at ball and drove it into the face of a sonof one of the norman lords at court</s>  the boy drew his dagger andthere would have been blood shed but wulf who was passing at thetime and saw that the thing was a pure mishap and not the resultof set intention threw himself between them</s> there was a great fuss over it for the boy took his tale to hisfather who demanded that osgod should be punished and woulddoubtless have gained his end had not wulf spoken to earl haroldwho intervened in the matter and persuaded the norman to let itdrop</s>  since then the boys have been great friends in their way</s> osgod is a year older than the young thane and has already madeup his mind to be his man when he grows up and he has got me toagree to it though i would rather that he had stuck to my handicraft</s> still the prospect is not a bad one</s>  harold will be king of englandwulf will be a powerful thane and will doubtless some day holdhigh place at court and as he seems to have taken a real likingto osgod the boy may have good chances</s> wulf will make a good fighting man one of these days</s>  harold seesthat all his pages are well instructed in arms and the two boysoften have a bout with blunted swords when wulf comes to my smithyand by my faith though i have taught osgod myself and he alreadyuses his arms well the young thane is fully a match for him</s>  youwould hardly believe that the boy can read as well as a monk butit is so</s>  earl harold you know thinks a good deal of educationand has founded a college at waltham</s>  he persuaded wulfs fatherto send him there and indeed will take none as his pages unlessthey can read</s>  i see not what good reading can do to most men butdoubtless for one who is at court and may hold some day a high postthere it is useful to be able to read deeds and grants of estatesinstead of having to trust others interpretation</s> i wondered to see you press forward so suddenly into the crowdneighbour seeing that you are a busy man but i understand nowthat you had an interest in the affair</s> that had i</s>  i was holding myself in readiness if that norman boydrew his dagger to give him such a blow across the wrist with mycudgel that it would be long before he handled a weapon again</s>  ifear wulf has got himself into trouble</s>  the bishop will doubtlesscomplain to the king of the language used by one of harolds pagesand though the earl is well able to see that no harm comes to thelad it is likely he will send him away to his estates for a time</s> for he strives always to avoid quarrels and disputes and thoughhe will not give way a jot in matters where it seems to him thatthe good of the realm is concerned he will go much farther lengthsthan most men would do in the way of conciliation</s>  look how he hasborne with tostig and with the earls of mercia</s>  he seems to haveno animosity in his nature but is ready to forgive all injuriesas soon as pardon is asked</s> the smith was not far wrong in his opinion as to what was likelyto happen</s>  as soon as wulf returned to the palace he was told thatthe earl desired his presence and he proceeded at once to theapartment where harold transacted public business</s>  it was a hallof considerable size the floor was strewed with rushes threescribes sat at a table and to them the earl dictated his repliesand decisions on the various matters brought before him</s>  when hesaw wulf enter he rose from his seat and beckoning to him tofollow pushed aside the hangings across a door leading to anapartment behind and went in</s>  wulf had no fear whatever of anysevere consequence to himself from his quarrel with walter fitzursebut he was ashamed that his thoughtlessness should have given theslightest trouble to the earl for popular as he was among allclasses of men in southern england harold was an object of loveas well as respect to his dependents and indeed to all who camein close contact with him</s> the earl was now fortyone years of age</s>  he was very tall and wasconsidered the strongest man in england</s>  his face was singularlyhandsome with an expression of mingled gentleness and firmness</s> his bearing was courteous to all</s>  he united a frank and straightforwardmanner with a polished address rare among his rough countrymen</s> harold had travelled more and farther than any englishman of hisage</s>  he had visited foreign courts and mingled with people moreadvanced in civilization than were those of england or normandyand was centuries ahead of the mass of his countrymen</s>  he was anardent advocate of education a strong supporter of the nationalchurch an upholder of the rights of all men and although heoccasionally gave way to bursts of passion was of a singularlysweet and forgiving disposition</s> king edward was respected by his people because coming after twoutterly worthless kings he had an earnest desire for their goodalthough that desire seldom led to any very active results</s>  he wasa member of their own royal house</s>  he was deeply religious</s>  hislife was pure and simple and although all his tastes and sympathieswere with the land in which he had been brought up englishmenforgave him this because at least he was a saxon while hispredecessors had been danes</s>  but while they respected edward forharold their real ruler they felt a passionate admiration</s>  he wasa worthy representative of all that was best in the saxon character</s> he possessed in an eminent degree the openness of nature the frankliberality the indomitable bravery and the endurance of hardshipthat distinguished the race</s>  he was earl of the west saxons andas such had special claims to their fealty</s> london it was true did not lie in his earldom but in that of hisbrother leofwyn but leofwyn and harold were as onetrue brothersin heart and in disposition</s>  the gentleness and courtesy of mannerthat although natural had been softened and increased by haroldscontact with foreigners was not only pardoned but admired becausehe was englands champion against foreigners</s>  he had fought andvictoriously alike against the norwegians the danes of northumbriaand the welsh and he struggled as sturdily though peacefullyagainst norman influence in england</s>  already the dread of normanpreponderance was present in the minds of englishmen</s>  it was nosecret that in his early days edward had held out hopes if he hadnot given an actual promise to william of normandy that he shouldsucceed him</s>  of late the king had been somewhat weaned from hisnorman predilections and had placed himself unreservedly in haroldshands giving to the latter all real power while he confined himselfto the discharge of religious exercises and to the supervision ofthe building of his abbey varied occasionally by hunting expeditionsfor he still retained a passionate love of the chase but men knewthat the warlike duke of normandy would not be likely to forget thepromise and that trouble might come to england from over the sea</s> harold then they not only regarded as their present ruler butas their future king and as the national leader and champion</s> edward had no children</s>  the royal house was extinct save for edwardthe atheling who like the present king had lived all his lifeabroad and could have no sympathy with englishmen</s>  there beingthen no one of the royal house available who but harold the headof the great house of godwin the earl of the west saxons thevirtual ruler of england could be chosen</s>  the english kingsalthough generally selected from the royal house ruled rather bythe election of the people as declared by their representatives inthe witan than by their hereditary right</s>  the prince next insuccession by blood might at the death of the sovereign be calledking but he was not really a monarch until elected by the witanand formally consecrated</s> it had been nine months after he had been acclaimed to the throneby the people of london that king edward had been elected king bythe witan and formally enthroned</s>  thus then the fact that harolddid not belong to the royal family mattered but little in the eyesof englishmen</s>  to them belonged the right of choosing their ownmonarch and if they chose him who was to say them nay</s> wulf felt uncomfortable as he followed the stately figure into theinner room but he faced the earl as the door closed behind himwith as fearless a look as that with which he had stood before thehaughty prelate of london</s>  a slight smile played upon harolds faceas he looked down upon the boy</s> you are a troublesome varlet wulf and the lord bishop has beenmaking serious complaint of you to the king</s>  he says that you brawledwith his page walter fitzurse that you used insolent words againsthis countrymen and that you even withstood himself</s>  what have youto say to this</s> the brawling was on the part of the bishops page and not of minemy lord</s>  i was running out to carry the message with which youcharged me to ernulf of dover when i ran against fitzurse</s>  thatwas not my fault but a pure mischance nevertheless i expressedmy regret in fitting terms</s>  instead of accepting them he spokeinsolently talked of chastising me and put his hand on the hiltof his dagger</s>  then my lord i grew angry too</s>  why should i thepage of earl harold submit to be thus contemptuously spoken to bythis young norman who is but the page of an upstart bishop andwhom if your lordship will give permission i would right willinglyfight with swords or any other weapons</s>  doubtless in my anger idid not speak respectfully of walters countrymen and for this iam sorry since it has been the ground of complaint and of troubleto you</s>
in fact wulf you spoke as a quarrelsome boy and not as the pageof one who has the cares of this kingdom on his shoulders and whosegreat desire is to keep peace between all parties the earl putin gravely</s> for the first time wulf hung his headi was wrong my lord</s> you were wrong wulf it is not good always to say what we thinkand you as my page should bear in mind that here at court itbehoves you to behave and to speak not as a headstrong boy but asone whose words may rightly or wrongly be considered as an echoof those you may have heard from me</s>  and now to the third chargethat you withstood the prelate a matter that in the kings eyesis a very serious one</s> the bishop would give ear to nought i had to say</s>  he listened tohis own pages account and not to mine and when i said in my defencethat though i did use the words about the normans i did so merelyas one boy quarrelling with the other he said i ought to have myears slit</s>  surely my lord a freeborn thane is not to be spokento even by a norman bishop as if he were a norman serf</s>  i onlyreplied that before there was any slitting of ears your lordshipwould have a say in the matter</s>  so far i admit i did withstandthe bishop and i see not how i could have made other reply</s> it would have been better to have held your peace altogetherwulf</s> it would my lord but it would also surely have been better hadthe bishop abstained from talking about slitting ears</s> that would have been better also but two wrongs do not make aright</s>  i was present when the bishop made his complaint and uponmy inquiring more into the matter his version was somewhat similarto yours</s>  i then pointed out to him that if holy bishops lost theirtempers and used threats that were beyond their power to carry intoeffect they must not be too severe upon boys who forget the respectdue to their office</s>  nevertheless i admitted that you were wrongand i promised the king who was perhaps more disturbed by thisincident than there was any occasion for that i would take you totask seriously and that to avoid any further brawl between you andyoung fitzurse you should for a time be sent away from court</s>  idid this on the agreement that the bishop should on his partadmonish walter fitzurse against discourteous behaviour and unseemlybrawling and had i known that he had put his hand on his daggeri would have gone further</s>  have you any witnesses that he did so</s> yes my lord i saw the smith ulred among those standing by anddoubtless he would see the action</s> that is well harold said</s>  i shall acquaint the bishop with thefact when i tell him that i have ordered you to leave for yourestate at steyning and that if his page denies it i have witnessesto prove the truth of your assertions</s>  i think in that case he willbe glad to drop the matter for were i to mention the fact to theking he who has a horror of the drawing of weapons would orderwalter fitzurse to be sent back to normandy</s>  so your exile is notlikely to be of long duration</s>  you understand wulf that i am notseriously angered with you in this matter</s>  you are but a boy andone cannot expect that you will behave as a prudent man but rememberlad even a boys words may do mischief especially when placed asyou are</s>  there may come a time when you shall show by deeds and notby words your feelings against the normans but till then bearyourself prudently</s>  we saxons are over given to hasty words andthis is a fault</s>  i myself as all men know have no love for thenormans but no one has heard me speak against them</s>  the king lovesthem as is but natural seeing that he was brought up amongst themand i have not withstood his wishes in the matter trying only thata certain amount of preferment in the land should be bestowed uponthose who are its owners and not strangers to it and its tongue</s> you will ride this afternoon for steyning wulf but i hope it willnot be long before you are back again</s>  if i had my own way in thematter i should think that sufficient had already been said anddone in so trifling a matter as a boys quarrel but as it has beenbrought before our king by a bishop it is in the kings eyes aserious business for assuredly he himself would have borne a reprooffrom william of london more meekly than you did and having thereforebecome a church matter it is altogether beyond my power to interfere</s> at any rate a short sojourn on your estate will do you no harmit is sometime since you were there and it is a good thing thatthe lord of the soil should be well known by those over whom he isplaced</s> wulf bowed deeply and withdrew</s>  the prospect of a visit for a fewweeks or even months to steyning was not a terrible one</s>  it wassome years since he had stayed there for any time</s>  he had been twoyears at waltham and since his fathers death had been for themost part with harold and the thought of an unrestricted life andof spending his time as he chose hunting and hawking and goingabout among his tenants was by no means unpleasant</s>  he was quitesatisfied that harold was not seriously angered with him and foranything else he cared little</s> as he understood that his duties as a page were at present at anend he thought he would first call upon ulred the smith to askhim if he had seen walter fitzurse handle his dagger and also totell osgod that he was going away for a time</s>  he found the smithat work</s> good morning master wulf though this is not the first time ihave seen you today for i was at hand when you had that quarrelwith the norman page</s> yes i caught sight of your face ulred</s>  it was about that i havecome to you</s>  the bishop has made complaint against me to the kingand earl harold has ordered me to go down to steyning for a time</s> of course i acted wrongly in speaking as i did to the bishop butso far as walter fitzurse is concerned i maintain that i did nowrong</s>  i told my lord as much and that the norman put hand uponhis dagger</s>  the earl said that if i could prove that it would benefitmy case</s>  i told him that i had seen you close by but that i didnot know whether you saw the page do it</s> assuredly i did the smith replied and had my cudgel in readinessto tap him on the wrist if he had drawn his dagger</s>  i would testifythe same before king edward himself</s> thank you ulred i will tell my lord so</s> i am sorry you are to be sent away from court</s>  that is a bad jobmaster wulf and osgod here will miss you greatly</s> that shall i the lad said</s>  could you not take me down with youyoung master</s>  you could teach me there how to comport myself asyour squire so that when the time comes that you need one i shouldknow my duties</s>  besides you could practise on me with sword andbattleaxe</s> i could not do much in the way of teaching you osgod seeing asyet i am myself but a learner but i should be glad in truth tohave you with me and it would be good for me to keep up my practicein arms</s>  i shall feel almost like a stranger there and should liketo have one i know with me</s>  i could ask earl harold to let me havea horse

with youi think that each night i can get to the hostelrie where you mayput up but if not it matters little i can make my way after youand join you therethat is if my father will give me permissionto go</s> you may as well go sooner as later the smith said</s>  since youhave taken into your head that you will be master wulfs man i seenot that it will benefit you remaining in the forge</s>  you know enoughnow to mend a broken rivet and to do such repairs to helm and armouras may be needed on an expedition therefore if the young thaneis minded to take you i have naught to say against it</s> then so shall it be wulf said i shall see my lord harold beforei start and will tell him that you are minded to be my man andthat i am minded so to take you</s>  he will not object i am sure butit

up behind me on my horse and now i willgo back to the palace</s>  i may have to wait some time before ican see earl harold</s>  from sunrise to sunset he has but a fewmoments to himself and i shall have to watch my time to geta word with him</s> it was not indeed until two oclock in the afternoon thatwulf had a chance of speaking to the duke</s>  then seeing thathe was for the moment alone he entered the room and stoodwith bowed head waiting for harold to address him</s> so you have come to say goodbye wulf the latter said kindlyit is best so boy</s>  a time in the country will do you good andthere will be much for you to do down there</s>  i have ordered two ofmy men to be in readiness to mount and ride with you for i wouldnot that you should go unattended</s>  one of them will bear a messagefrom me and a letter under my hand to the steward and will tellhim that although you will of course remain as my ward until youcome of age you are in all respects to be treated as if you

he regarded it as a step forward in life</s>  earl haroldcould certainly had he been so inclined have smoothed down theangry prelate and could have retained him at court but by the wayhe had spoken wulf was convinced that the earl let him go becausehe thought that it was good for him to be away</s>  for four years hehad been under tutelage first at waltham and then at the court</s> in the last position his life had indeed been a pleasant one foras one of harolds pages he had mixed with all the noble youths ofthe court and had had a place at every festive gathering</s>  stillhe had been but a page and treated as a boy</s>  now he was to goforth and to learn his duties as his fathers successor</s> harolds steward who had since the thanes death acted as theearls agent in the management of the estate would instruct himdoubtless in his civil duties while the soldier who rode behindhim would teach him how to lead men in battle and how to make thefighting force of the estate efficient</s>  beyond these duties histime would be his own</s>  he would have responsibilities but theywould be the responsibilities of a thane towards his tenants andnot of a page towards his master</s>  he was going away a boy but ifit pleased harold that he should remain away for two years he wouldreturn a thane</s>  a young one indeed but one who had learned theduties of his station and who if needs be could take his placein the field of battle at the head of his followers</s>  for evenputting aside the normans from whom the earl seemed to think thegreatest danger would come there was never any long cessation offighting in england</s> there were the welsh who were always turbulent the danes ofnorthumbria who were still a distinct people although throughoutthe rest of england their identity was fast being merged into thatof the saxons</s>  there were the norsemen still ready to take everyopportunity of interfering in the affairs of england or if noneoffered to plunder and harry the coast</s>  there were the earls ofmercia who bore no great love to the house of godwin and whoresented the ascendency of the west saxons</s>  lastly there washarolds brother tostig a fiery and turbulent noble now earl ofnorthumbria who was jealous of harold ever ready to join in plotsand in close alliance with norway already he had several timeswithstood the royal authority and would assuredly again become afomenter of trouble should he see a favourable opportunity</s>  at thekings death if not before that opportunity would be sure topresent itself</s>  harold would be certainly chosen king by the peopleof london and by the west saxons but almost as certainly would hisclaim be disputed by the earls of mercia on one hand and by tostigand the danes on the other</s>  wulf was sure therefore that the workspent in preparing his tenants to take the field when called uponto do so would not be wasted</s> full of these thoughts he rode for some miles from westminsterwithout addressing himself to the two men behind him then bethinkinghim that these were trusted followers of the earl and had beenspecially told off by him to accompany and stay with him he calledthem up to his side</s>  wulf had donned a riding suit instead of courtattire which in deference to the kings partiality for the normanswas even among the staunchest opposers of the foreigners acompromise between saxon and norman fashions</s>  he now wore a tunicof a bright green cloth girded in at the waist and reaching onlyto the knee</s>  over this was worn a garment closely resembling theroman toga though somewhat less ample</s>  the folds in front fellbelow the waist but it was looped up at each shoulder by a broochleaving the arms bare</s>  his legs were clad in tightlyfitting trousersand his feet in somewhat high shoes</s>  on his head he wore a cap inshape closely resembling the phrygian bonnet</s>  he was armed with adagger and a short sword which hung by a leather strap two orthree inches long from his belt</s>  the outer garment had a hood whichcould in bad weather be drawn over the head</s> the man who was the bearer of harolds orders to the steward worea civilian dress not unlike that of wulfs</s>  he occupied the positionof a confidential scribe to harold</s>  the other wore the garb of asoldier</s>  he was clothed from head to foot in a tight fitting leathersuit upon which were sewn iron rings overlapping each other andstrongly resembling in appearance the chainarmour of later days</s> his casque with a curtain of leather similarly covered and affordinga protection to the neck cheeks and throat hung from his saddlebowand he wore a cap with a long projecting peak while a cloak wasthrown over his shoulders and fell almost to his feet</s> i am afraid you will find it but dull time with me leof wulfsaid as they came up abreast of him for the earl says that he hascharged you to remain with me at steyning</s> i shall not be sorry for that the soldier said bluntly for ishall be right glad to be away from these normans who fill everyplace at court and swagger there as if englishmen were but dirtunder their feet</s>  moreover i love not london nor its ways andshall be glad to be down again among honest country folk though iwould still rather be following my lord the earl in the field</s> and you master gurth will your stay down at steyning be a longone</s> no indeed</s>  i have but to bear my masters wishes and instructionsto the steward and to stay for a few days to see that they arecarried out according to his desires</s>  i am not like leof for iprefer life in london where one meets with learned monks and otherscan obtain sometimes the use of a choice manuscript and can hearthe news from beyond the seas whereas in the country there isnought to talk about save beeves and sheep</s>  i like the journey wellenough though i would that the animal i bestrode were more gentlein his paces</s>  he has for the last halfhour been fretting on therein to place himself by the side of yours</s>  horses are well enoughfor nobles and fighting men but for a peaceful scrivener likemyself a chair makes a far more comfortable seat</s> the soldier gave a contemptuous grunt and wulf laughed</s>  it iswell that we have not all the same tastes but for my part a seatin a chair tires me more than one in a saddle and i am never morehappy than when galloping briskly along and he shook the reinsa signal which the horse had been expecting for a considerable timeand at once responded to by breaking into a canter</s> stay you i pray master wulf the scrivener cried in greattribulation as his horse followed the example of its companion</s> even if the animal does not break my neck he will jolt the lifeout of me</s>  i pray you curb him in if you would not

journey on horseback</s>  i was scarceconscious indeed that i touched my horse but he is used to travelmore rapidly and was so eager to be off at the slightest hint thati was willing that he should do so</s>  we will try and journey soberlyfor the rest of the distance</s> osgod was overtaken plodding steadily along the road fifteen milesfrom town</s>  leof took him up on his horse and they reached guildfordjust as the sun was setting</s>  the inn which stood in the principalstreet of the town was a low building built with a massive frameworkfilled in with bricks</s>  the groundfloor was occupied by a singleroom</s>  at one end was the great fireplace where over a pile ofblazing logs were hung many cauldrons and pots</s>  round the room rana raised bench some six feet wide on which the guests disposedthemselves for sleep at night rough tables and benches occupiedthe rest of the room</s>  some twenty or thirty travellers were seatedat these</s>  few were eating but the greater portion had horns ofbeer or mead before them</s>  as wulf and his companions entered aftergiving over their horses to one of the helpers the host seeingby his attire that he was of condition above the ordinary cameforward and led him to the end of the room nearest the fire wherethe floor was raised a foot and a half above the general levelforming a sort of dais where travellers of distinction could taketheir meals apart from the rest of the guests</s>  leof was now spokesman</s> we will have supper and of your best master host for we haveridden from london</s>  we are in the service of earl harold and areriding with this young thane wulf of steyning</s> the name of earl harold was sufficient to gain for them the bestattentions of their host and in twenty minutes supper was servedconsisting of trout broiled over the fire swines flesh and astew of fowls and smoked bacon flavoured with herbs</s>  wulf took thehead of the table and the other three sat a short distance belowhim</s>  the dishes were handed round and each with his dagger cut offhis portion and ate it on his wooden platter with the assistanceof dagger and fingers only for the utility of forks was at thattime a matter undreamt of</s>  after the meal was over the host broughta ewer of water with a napkin and each dipped his fingers into thewater an operation necessary even for the most dainty feeder</s> presently a glee singer came in and for an hour amused the guestswith songs for the most part of a patriotic character</s> wulf was then conducted by the host to a small chamber upstairswhere there was the luxury of a bed stuffed with straw</s>  the restof the travellers including wulfs companions merely wrappedthemselves in their cloaks and lay down on the raised bench whichran round the room</s> on the afternoon of the third day the party arrived at steyning</s> it was four years since wulf had been at home and he gave a shoutof pleasure as his eye fell on the long low house with its backgroundof trees and touching his horse with his heel he left his companionsbehind and galloped towards the door</s>  an old servitor came out</s> why cedric do you not know me</s>  i am wulf whom you first taughtto play singlestick and to draw a bow</s> why surely it is my young master cedric said taking the handthat wulf held out to him and placing it to his lips this is aglad day indeed for us all</s>  we have longed sorely for a sight ofyou for though i say nought against master egbert the steward whois well liked by all it is not the same as having our lord withus</s>  you have come to stay i trust</s> for a time at any rate cedric</s>  earl harold wishes me to learn myduties as a thane and to fit myself to lead my people in the fieldif it be necessary</s> i trust that it never will be so cedric said but as we foughtunder your father so will we all be ready to fight under you shouldit be needful</s>  the men of steyning were never backward when therewas fighting to be done and in my young days there was no lack ofthat though we have had quiet times since king edward came to thethrone</s> the house was not built for the purpose of resistance for unlikethe normans the saxons did not deem it necessary to convert theirhouses into castles</s>  it was however massively framed the windowson the groundfloor were barred the door was strong and solid andafter nightfall none could come in or go out without the knowledgeand consent of the master</s>  wulfs companions came up just as thesteward himself appeared at the door</s>  he knew both gurth and leofhaving himself been in the service of harold before being deputedby him to manage the estates of steyning during the earls guardianshipof its thane</s> the earl sends his greetings to you egbert gurth said and hehas sent us hither with the young thane who as the letter i bringfrom the earl will inform you has come down to take up his positionas lord here and to learn from you all things connected with hisestate</s> welcome to steyning thane the steward said doffing his capit is well that you should be here</s>  i have done my best to carryout the earls commands to keep all things in readiness for yourcoming and to be just and fair to the tenants seeing that theypay their dues and yet not pressing too hardly upon them if thingsgo not well with them but it is always best that the master shouldbe in his own place and right willingly do i give over my authorityto you</s> the authority has been in good hands i know well wulf saidand right heartily do i thank you for having so well filled myplace but i would not take up my thaneship as yet i am but a boyand have to learn my duties from you and shall account myself butas your pupil</s>  i know something of the ways of court but nothingat all of those of the country and it will be long before i am fitto take the control of things into my own hands</s> they had by this time entered the great hall which formed the commonroom of the establishment</s>  its arrangement was similar to that ofthe room at the inn with its raised dais for the master his familyand guests while the rest of the room was devoted to the retainersand servants</s>  the cooking however was carried on in a room apart</s> there were two fireplaces one upon the dais and the other in thebody of the hall</s>  on the walls hung trophies of the chase and armsof all sorts</s>  the wooden roof was supported by massive beams andwith the exception of the trophies on the walls there was no attemptat decoration of any kind</s>  during the residence of the family atthe house however the hangings of tapestry the work of generationsof dames of steyning their daughters and maids hung upon the wallsround the dais</s> the news quickly spread of the arrival of the young thane and ascore of men and eight or ten women and maids flocked into the hallto welcome him and as he stood on the dais each in turn came forwardto kiss his hand and salute him</s> i think my first order must be he said to the steward that acask of your best ale be broached</s> that shall be done at once egbert replied there is never alack of drink here but the best is none too good for the occasion</s> and who is this youth with you</s>  he went on when he had given thenecessary orders pointing to osgod who was standing somewhat shylyapart</s> he is my friend and is going to be my body attendant and squirewulf said</s>  he like myself knows nothing as yet of his dutiesbut that he will be faithful and trusty i know full well and theearl himself said that i did wisely to bring him with me</s> i will myself instruct him in his duties egbert said whichindeed are not hard to learn by one of willing mind</s>  he will standbehind you at table will hand you your cup and take your orders</s> in the old times it would have been his duty to see that you werenot struck down by a traitorous blow while you drank but thosedays are passed</s>  when in the field he will carry your helmet tillyou need to put it on will keep close to you in the fight and guardyou with his shield from arrows and with his sword from attacksfrom behind he will carry your banner and see that as long as hehas strength to hold it it floats fairly out as a rallying pointfor your men</s>  in the field indeed his duties are numerous but athome in peace beyond seeing that your arms are bright and cleanand that your orders are carried out properly he will have butlittle to do</s>  it is well that you brought him with you for otherwiseyou would have had to choose one of the sons of your tenants andthe choice would have been a difficult one for each would havedesired the honour and whichever you chose there would have beensore jealousy among the others</s> the next day there was a great gathering in the hall</s>  the whole ofthe tenants attended and took the oath to be wulfs men as theyhad been those of his father to obey his orders and to follow himin the field with the due number of men according to the size oftheir holdings while wulf on his part swore to protect them fromall wrong and oppression to be a just master calling upon themonly for such service as he was entitled to demand and exactingno feus or payments beyond those customary</s>  a bullock had beenkilled and after the ceremony was over all present sat down to abanquet at which much ale was drunk and feasting went on tillnightfall</s> the next morning wulf accompanied by leof and egbert rode roundthe estate choosing among the sons of the tenants thirty stoutyoung men willing to enrol themselves as housecarls receiving aregular rate of pay and ready at all times to give service underarms and to remain in the field as long as they might be requiredwhereas the general levy could only be kept under arms for a limitedtime</s>  he had already gone into the matter with leof who pointedout that as at present he had no wish to keep up any show or tohave a body of armed men in the house it would suffice if the menwere exercised every day for a month and after that merely practisedwith sword and battleaxe for two or three hours once a week</s>  onthese terms he had no difficulty in obtaining considerably morethan the number he asked for and finally fifty men were enrolled</s> for those carls helmets were bought and coats of ringed armour madeand for a month they exercised daily</s>  of manoeuvring there waslittle indeed</s>  the saxons and danes alike fought in line with butroom enough between them to swing their battleaxes</s>  each carrieda spear as well as an axe and when repelling the assault of anenemy closed up so that their shields wellnigh touched each other</s> their exercise was generally either to engage in combats betweenchosen pairs or dividing into two parties to fight line againstline with blunted poles for spears and with stout cudgels for axes</s> leof in these combats acted as judge decided which side had gainedthe victory praised the skilful and chided the careless andsluggish</s>  he gave lessons in the use of the sword and battleaxeto wulf and osgod sometimes pitting them against each othersometimes fighting himself against wulf and teaching osgod how toassist his master by covering him with his shield</s> sometimes he would order three or four of the men to shoot withblunted arrows at wulf whom he taught to catch them on his shieldor to sever the shafts with a blow of his sword while osgod standingby helped to cover him when two or three arrows flew at him together</s> this was a daily exercise and even after the months regular workwas over some of the men came up every day to shoot until wulf hadattained such coolness and skill that he could in the great majorityof cases cut the shafts in two with his sword</s> but the whole day was by no means given up to warlike exercises</s> wulf rode out with the steward inspecting the houses and farmslearning what there was to be learned of the rude processes ofagriculture investigating the complaints of the depredationscommitted by errant herds of swine or by neighbours cattle andsheep seeing what was required in the repairs of farmhouses andlearning from egbert to discriminate between those who were unableto pay their dues owing to misfortune illness or murrain amongthe animals and those whose josses were due to their own sloth orcarelessness</s>  upon these visits too the arms of the tenants wereinspected to ascertain that they could properly fulfil their serviceif summoned to take the field</s> the lands embraced by wulfs feof were of considerable extentreaching down to the sea where they were some eight miles broadand running back twelve miles beyond steyning</s>  several small hamletslay within it and in case of war he could summon more than threehundred men to his banner</s>  several of the neighbouring thanes rodein as soon as they heard that wulf had returned to fill his fathersplace at steyning and these visits were duly returned</s>  but accustomedas wulf had been to the orderliness of the court of the asceticking edward the rude manners and nightly revelry of these roughthanes by no means pleased him so that he was glad when the visitswere over and he could remain quietly at home where he was notwithout frequent guests</s> the most regular of his visitors was the prior of the monastery atbramber which had been founded by the piety of one of wulfsancestors</s>  the prior had though wulf was ignorant of it receiveda letter from earl harold asking him to befriend wulf to encouragehim to keep up the studies he had followed at waltham and to seethat he did not fall into the drinking habit so common among thesaxons</s>  the priest was well fitted for the mission</s>  he was by nomeans a strict disciplinarian but the monastery had the reputationof being one of the best managed in sussex and among the monkswere many of good blood</s>  he was passionately fond of art andencouraged its exercise among the monks so that the illuminatedmissals of bramber were highly prized and added largely to therevenues of the monastery</s> the prior had been one of the monks at waltham and owed his elevationto the influence of earl harold with the late thane of steyning</s> he was well taught in all the learning of the day and having beenfor a time at westminster knew more of court life than the majorityof the priors of isolated monasteries and could suit his conversationto his hearer</s>  harold had said in his letter the lad has goodparts</s>  he is somewhat full of mischief and has got into a scrapehere by a quarrel with a norman page and by failing somewhat inthe respect due to william of london who took his compatriotspart with too much zeal</s>  but wulf is shrewd and benefited greatlyby his stay at waltham and both for the lads own sake and for myfriendship with the good thane his father i would fain that hegrew up not only a sturdy englishman as to which i have no mannerof doubt but one who may some day play his part at court and bea worthy friend and counsellor of an english king</s>  therefore i prayyou father to keep an eye on the lad and spare him what time youcan from your duties</s>  tell him not that i have written to you forit is the nature of youth to be averse to anything that looks likeguardianship</s> such a request from earl harold was regarded by the prior as anorder and a few days after wulf was installed at steyning the priorrode over on his palfrey accompanied only by the almoner of theconvent</s> peace to you my son he said as wulf bowed respectfully to himi have called not only as the prior of the monastery founded by thepiety of one of the thanes of steyning but to welcome one who wasa pupil at earl harolds college of waltham in which i at one timewas a preceptor</s>  not when you were there for i was installed herejust before your good fathers death</s> i left there two years since wulf said in order to be one ofearl harolds pages but i have not forgotten my reading for theearl insists that his pages give two hours a day to study</s> tis a good rule the prior said for learning is like a weaponit soon becomes rusted when thrown aside</s>  you will i hope continuethe habit</s> i should wish to do so father but there are no manuscripts here</s> in that at least i can supply your wants the prior said</s>  mymonastery has a good library and it will be quite at your serviceand also my advice in any matters that may concern you</s>  my almonerhere brother john knows pretty well the circumstances of most ofyour people and may be able to tell you where your alms may bewell bestowed and where they would do more harm than good</s>  theworthless are ever the most importunate and for every honest manin need there are twenty rogues abegging</s> the ice once broken the prior came over frequently</s>  his conversationwas bright and interesting</s>  he himself was engaged in writing ahistory of the saxon and danish monarchs from the times of alfredand had stores of anecdotes of people and events of whom wulf hadbefore heard only vague traditions from the wandering singers andstorytellers who travelled the country and were welcome guestsin every household</s>  as wulf was urged by the prior to come overwhenever time hung on his hands his visits to the monastery werenaturally very much more frequent than those of the prior to steyning</s> sometimes he would sit in the private apartment of the prior butmore often he spent his time studying the rare manuscripts orwatching the monks at their work of copying and illuminating</s>  ifhe went in the evening he generally sat in the refectory where themonks for the most part spent their evening in talk and harmlessamusement for the strict rules and discipline that prevailed inmonastic establishments on the continent had been unknown up tothat time in england although some of the norman bishops were doingtheir best to introduce them into the establishments in theirdiocesesa proceeding that caused great discontent and wasstrongly opposed by the english monks</s>  these had hitherto regardedmonastic life as one of work for the good of the poor and asaffording for those who wished it a tranquil retirement from thetrials of the world</s>  moreover it offered special attractions tothose of quiet and studious tastes since the monasteries providedthe architects and the painters the teachers and the writers andit was here alone that learning was maintained and fostered</s> consequently at bramber there was none of that monastic asceticismthat prevailed abroad and later became the rule in england also</s> during the day the monks had their pursuits according to theirtastes</s>  there were those who worked in the copying and paintingroom</s>  there were some who drew plans for churches or the dwellingsof the wealthy and who sometimes went out and superintended thecarrying out of their designs</s>  some were in charge of the gardenwhere the work was chiefly done by the lay servitors and where theherbs and simples were grown that were used in the concoction ofthe medicines distributed among the sick and highly prized throughoutthe country round</s>  two or three were skilled in music and thesetaught and conducted the choir while two acted as teachers toyouths the sons of thanes and others who moved by the ardourwith which their earl advocated learning intrusted their sons tothe monks for education</s>  then when the days work was done andvespers sung in the chapel the monks gathered in the refectory</s> the conversation was of a bright and varied description and aswulf moved about from group to group he listened to the talk withfar greater pleasure than he had ever derived from that at courtand largely increased his knowledge in many respects</s> national matters were discussed with keen interest for the monkswere all english and viewed with bitter hostility the elevationof foreigners to the chief dignities of the church not only becausethey were foreigners but because they introduced innovations ofall kinds and sought to reduce the church of england to subjectionto rome whereas previously it had been wholly independent of papalauthority</s>  in secular matters too there were dangers that threatenedthe tranquillity of the country</s>  chief among these were the turbulenceand ambition of tostig and the menace to the kingdom by his extensiveearldom of northumbria with its alien danish population which wasrendered more serious by his alliance with the kings of norway</s> then too it was doubtful whether the great central earldom ofmercia could be relied upon to act cordially with the west saxonsgriffith of wales was still restless and turbulent and lastlythere was the everpresent menace of the norman duke</s>  had englandbeen united it could have laughed at the pretensions of the dukeof normandy but with northumbria ready at any moment to break intocivil war and with mercia doubtful the claim of normandy howevershadowy and indefensible could not but be considered as a graveelement of danger</s> listening to the talk of the monks wulf learned much more as to theactual situation than he had done in the court of the normanizedking and his feelings of patriotism became more and more developedand strengthened while he applied himself with even greater ardourto his military exercises as he recognized more fully the necessitythat might arise for every west saxon to be ready to take his placein the line of battle</s>  the evenings that he spent at home were byno means dull</s>  it was only in considerable towns that there wereinns for the accommodation of travellers</s>  everywhere else thesewere dependent upon hospitality and no door was ever closed intheir faces</s>  it was seldom that less than five or six travellersrested for the night at steyning and often that number was largelyexceeded</s>  besides the wayfarers there were the professional wanderersthe minstrels the storytellers and occasionally a troupe ofbuffoons</s> all these were welcome for they brought the news from without thelast rumours in london concerning the quarrels of the earls themovements of the danish ships that were harrying the coast andthose of the vessels earl harold despatched to cope with them theprices of wool and hides in the chief markets and even reports ofwhat was happening beyond the seas</s>  leaving the dais wulf wouldgo down and listen to the talk of the travellers or when theywere of a degree above the common have them up beside him andquestion them as to their journeyings the places they had visitedand the personages they had seen</s>  thus his hours were fully occupiedfrom morning until night</s>  he found far less time than he had expectedfor sport and although he occasionally went out with his falconsor hunted the stag in the forest which covered a wide extent ofcountry beyond the hills it was but seldom that he could findleisure for these amusements</s> it seems to me that you are always doing something wulf osgodsaid one day</s>  it is not at all the sort of life i should havethought a young thane would live</s>  why you work many more hours aday than i did in my fathers forge</s>  it is either books or theaffairs of the tenants or visiting the monastery all day when youare not at work with your sword exercises</s>  when i have done withmy work with leof i like to lie down in the sun and take it quietlyand i cannot understand how you can be for ever on foot</s> i have so many things to do osgod there is so much to learn andi do not wish to grow up a mere beer swiller like edmund of angmeringor ethelred of arundel</s>  their lives are as far as i can see nowhit higher or more worthy than that of their own serfs from whomthey differ only that they eat more drink more and sleep on softerbeds</s>  earl harold expects better things than that of me and i wantto make myself worthy of being one of those in whom he can placeconfidence and on whom he can depend in case of trouble</s>  i haveheard him say how bad it is for england that our thanes are inlearning and culture so far behind the nobles of other countriesand that if england is ever to take her place among great nationsit must be by her thanes first raising themselves to the level ofthe nobles abroad who are the counsellors of their kings</s>  i cannever hope to be anything like earl harold who is the wisest andgreatest of englishmen but i do hope so to fit myself that someday he may think me worthy of trust and confidence</s> well master osgod said lazily every one to his liking</s>  ihope to be a good soldier and your true servant but as for allthis thinking and learning it would weary me to death</s> chapter iii</s> at court</s> two months after wulf had gone down to steyning one of harolds menbrought a short letter from the earl himself</s>  i am glad to hearwulf it began from my steward egbert that you are applyingyourself so heartily to your work</s>  i have also good accounts of youfrom the prior of bramber who sometimes writes to me</s>  he is a goodand wise man as well as a learned one and i am right glad to hearthat you are spending your time so well</s>  i told you that you shouldhear if there was any alteration in your affair</s>  some change wasmade as soon as you had left for two days later meeting williamof london in the presence of the king i told him that i had inquiredfurther into the matter and had found that you were by no meansthe aggressor in the quarrel with young fitzurse for that he hadfingered his dagger and would doubtless have drawn it had therenot been many bystanders</s>  i also said that with all respect tothe bishop it would have been better had he not inclined his earssolely to the tale of his page and that under the circumstancesit was scarcely wonderful that being but a boy you had defendedyourself when you were as you deemed unjustly accused</s> the prelate sent at once for his page who stoutly denied that hehad touched the hilt of his dagger but i too had sent off forulred the armourer and he brought with him a gossip who had alsobeen present</s>  i asked the kings permission to introduce them andthey entirely confirmed your story</s>  fitzurse exclaimed that it wasa saxon plot to do him harm and i could see that the bishop wasof the same opinion but the king who is ever anxious to do justicedeclared at once that he was sure that the two craftsmen were butspeaking the truth</s>  he sternly rebuked fitzurse as a liar andsignified to the bishop that he would do well to punish him severelyby sending him back to normandy for that he would not tolerate hispresence at courtan order which the bishop obeyed with very badgrace</s>  but at any rate the lad was sent away by a ship a week later</s> after the bishop had left the audiencechamber the king said thathe was afraid he had acted with harshness to you as it seemed thatthe fault was by no means wholly on your side and that i could atonce recall you if i wished to do so</s>  i thanked his majestydutifully but said i thought it were best in all ways that for atime you should remain away from court</s>  in the first place youdeserved some punishment for your want of respect for the bishopto whom you should have submitted yourself even if you had thoughthim unjust</s>  in the second place as fitzurse had been sent awayit would create an animosity against you on the part of his countrymenat court were you to reappear at once and lastly that i consideredit would be to your benefit to pass at least some months on yourestates learning your duties as thane and making the acquaintanceof your people</s>  therefore i wished you to continue at steyning</s> it will assuredly be pleasant for you to know that you are no longerto be considered as being there in consequence of having fallenunder the kings displeasure but simply because it is my wish thatyou should for a time dwell among your people and fit yourself tobe a wise lord to them</s> wulf was much pleased at the receipt of this letter partly becausethe fact that he had been sent away in disgrace stung him and hehad felt obliged frankly to acknowledge to the neighbouring thanesthat he had been sent down on account of a quarrel with a normanpage but chiefly because it showed the kindly interest that haroldfelt in him and that although absent he had still thought of him</s> it was nigh ten months before he heard again</s>  during that time hehad grown a good deal and although he would never be tall hisframe had so widened out that it was evident he would grow into anexceptionally powerful man</s> at sixteen he was still a boy and although his position at steyningwhere although still under the nominal tutelage of the earlssteward he was practically lord and master accustomed to play thepart of host within its walls and that of feudal lord over thewide estates had given him the habits of authority and the bearingof one who respected himself the merry expression of his faceaided by a slight upward turn of his nose showed that in otherrespects he was unchanged</s>  he had learned with his weapons all thatleof could teach him</s>  he could wield a light battleaxe and withhis sword could turn aside or sever an arrow however sharply shotat him provided that he had time to mark its flight</s>  with aquarterstaff he was a match for any youth on the estate and hecould hurl a dart with unerring aim</s> osgod had sprung up into a powerful young

maybe the earl is going to start on some expedition though wehave heard of no trouble either in the north or in wales</s>  but evenif i stay at court osgod you will often be able to be away andcan

no indeed wulf osgod said nor a quarter of them for in truthyour wardrobe has grown prodigiously since we came here</s>  i had totalk it over with egbert having but little faith in my own wits</s> he advised me to take the two suits that were most fitted for courtsaying that if he heard you were going to remain there he wouldsend on the rest in charge of a couple of wellarmed men</s> that is the best plan doubtless wulf agreed</s>  my hawking suitand some of the others would be useless to me at court and it wouldhave been folly to have burdened ourselves with them if we arelikely to return

he was to accompany him</s> tis three months since i was away from london he said</s>  theking is going down into hereford to hunt and i am therefore freefor a while as there are no matters of state

brotherwulfnoth and his nephew hakon</s>  among the party was beorn a youngthane who also was a ward of the earl</s>  he was two years olderthan wulf but there had been a close friendship between them atedwards court</s>  shortly after wulfs departure beorn had also beensent by the earl to his estates in hampshire and had been recalledat the same time</s> beorn was far less strong and active than wulf having been veryweakly during the early years of his life nor had he had the sameadvantages of education as he only became harolds ward a yearafter wulf was installed as a page at westminster</s>  he was a youthof good and generous disposition and looked with feelings ofadmiration upon the strength and skill in arms of the younger ladand especially at his power of reading</s> i can never be like you there wulf he would say but i hope imay some day grow as strong as you and as skilful in arms</s> beorns stay in the country had done much for him his thin tallframe had filled out and there was a healthy colour on his cheek</s> he had practised diligently at military exercises and although hefound when on the first day after wulfs arrival in london hechallenged him to a trial in arms he was still very greatly hisinferior in skill and strength he bade fair to become a gallantfighter</s> it is a disappointment to me wulf he said as he picked up thebattleaxe that had been struck from his hand and sent flying acrossthe hall by a sweeping blow of wulfs weapon</s>  i have really workedvery hard and i did think that i ought to have caught you upseeing that i am two years the elder</s>  but you have gained more thani have</s>  i did as well as the other youths who were taught with meby the housecarl harold sent down with me but i am sure i shallnever be as quick or hit as strongly

 in another four or five years you will come toyour full strength and will be able to strike a far heavier blowthan i can now although i do not say heavier than i may be ableto do then as you are

we were pages together the bowermaidens of the queenalways made much of you while they called me impudent and wouldgive me many a slap on the cheek</s> well you deserved it richly wulf for you were always playingtricks upon themhiding their distaffs or tangling their threadand giving them pert answers when they wanted you to do theirerrands</s>  well i hope we shall be always great friends

for it</s>  we saxon thanes are too fond both of food and winecupand though i am no monk i would that our customs could be altered</s> i hate foreigners but their ways are in many respects better thanours</s>  the normans it is true may not be much better than we arebut then they are but northmen a little civilized but i have heardthe earl say that the french and still more the italians

grant that wulf</s>  think you that the smith and theshepherd the bowmaker and the weaver would be any the happiercould they read or even write than they are as they sing saxon songsover their

shield over me in the day of battle or to stand back to back withme in a handtohand fight</s> you should get him to stand in front of you beorn laughed</s>  hewould be a rare screen against arrows and javelins</s> the friends were well pleased when they heard they were both toaccompany harold to bosham which was one of the favourite abodesof the earls of wessex</s>  it had originally been built as a huntingseatbut godwin had grown to love the place with its woods extendingfor miles back and its quiet landlocked harbour and additions hadbeen made until it had grown to be in point of size at least aresidence worthy of the great earls and harold preferred it to anyof the many mansions belonging to him</s>  it was a large and gay partythat rode down the road through the quiet woods of surrey and sussex</s> they put up each night at the houses of thanes where as noticehad been sent of their coming they were royally entertained andthose selected were proud to afford hospitality to the earl</s> for a week they stayed at bosham hunting in the forests going offin parties under the guidance of the foresters some who cared notfor hard labour hunting in the woods between bosham and the hillswhile others went far inland into the weald which was for the mostpart covered by a great forest with but a few scattered hamletshere and there</s>  smoke rising among the trees showed where thecharcoalburners were at work or where the furnaces were glowingconverting the ore into the tough iron that furnished arms andarmour for the greater portion of the men of the south</s>  at the endof the week the earl announced to his guests that he had provideda new diversion for them</s> you see those three ships in the harbour he said</s>  they werebrought here last night and three hundred men have been at workall day preparing them for our reception</s>  i propose that we allembark with our dogs and servants and sail along the coast landingwhere we please and taking our sport</s>  as we sail eastward thereare abundant forests and the game is far more plentiful than hereand our trip will partake of the character of an adventure in thusdropping upon unknown places</s>  tents have been stored on board thevessels with abundance of good cheer of all kinds so that we canestablish ourselves where we will and sleep on shore instead ofrocking uneasily on the waves</s> the proposal was received with acclamation and the following morningthe whole party embarked upon the three ships</s>  the largest wasoccupied by harold himself his brother and nephew and six or sevenof his principal thanes</s>  in this craft too went wulf and beorn withtheir men</s>  on issuing from the harbour the ships heads were turnedto the east</s>  the wind was light and fitful the sails thereforewere not loosed and they proceeded under oars</s>  there was but littletide until they reached the extremity of the long point of selseapast which they were hurried at great speed by the rapid current</s> rowing closer inshore they got into quieter water and continuedtheir way until tide turned when they anchored and landing withtheir dogs hunted in the woods for some hours</s> on their return to the seashore they found the tents erected andsupper prepared and the sport having been good they remained anotherday</s>  the tide took them the next day past the shore of wulfs estateand he begged the earl to land there and to pass a day or two withhis company at steyning but all were bent upon the chase and theykept on until they reached the point where the white cliffs beganto rise from the edge of the water</s>  here they landed again andspent two or three days in hunting</s>  neither wulf nor beorn had beento sea before and the quiet motion of the ships with their bellyingsails and banks of sturdy oarsmen delighted them</s>  there had beenscarcely any motion and neither had felt the qualms which they hadbeen warned were generally experienced for a while by those whowent upon the sea for the first time</s> when the journey was resumed wulf was struck with surprise andalmost awe by the mighty cliffs that rose up from the waters edge</s> neither he nor beorn had seen anything like this for although boththeir estates bordered the sea the shores were flat and vesselsif needs be could be hauled up on shore</s> what would happen if a gale were to burst upon us here</s>  wulf saidto his companion</s>  if the waves were to dash us against those whiterocks the ships would be broken up like eggshells</s> your question is answered beorn said as a bay suddenly openedto their sight</s>  you see we are going in here and shall anchorsnugly somewhere up this river in front of us which is truly thebest haven we have seen since we left bosham</s>  half an hour laterthe vessels were moored to the bank close to a wooden bridge whichspanned the little river</s> chapter iv</s> a storm</s> after hunting for two days in the forests lying behind newhavenand in the valley in which lewes lies they again embarked</s>  themaster of harolds ship had expressed some doubts as to the weatherbut as he stated that it was but some eight miles round the greatcliff that they saw to the east and that beyond this the rocksceased and there was a bay in which they could ride at anchor orif necessary beach their vessels it was determined to proceed asharold had the day before been visited by a thane whose house laybut two miles from the shore and had accepted his invitation forthe party to take up their abode there for a few days as he promisedthem good sport in the forest</s>  the cliffs rose higher as theyproceeded</s>  they kept closer inshore and although they could seethat the clouds were flying rapidly overhead they felt no breezewhatever being protected from the wind by the lofty cliffs</s>  themaster was evidently uneasy for he urged the rowers to exertthemselves to the utmost</s>  wulf and beorn stood looking with amazementat the cliffs towering up beside them</s> is it not strange that they should rise like thislike a wallfrom the water</s>  wulf said</s>  had they been built up by human handsthey could scarcely have been more erect and regular</s>  i have neverseen anything at all like it on land</s> then it must be something formed by the sea wulf</s>  do you see thosecaverns at the foot of the cliff and in some places you see thereis a mound of rocks as if newly formed</s>  it may be that this whitestone is soft and that the sea beating against the foot wears itaway in time and then the rock overhead gives way by its weightand so leaves an upright wall</s>  perhaps long back these hills werelike other hills sloping gradually down into the sea but in timeperhaps many many years before the romans landed here the seabegan to eat them away and has continued to do so ever since untilthey are as we see them</s> that may be so beorn</s>  my father has told me that he could rememberwhen our estates stretched a good halfmile farther seaward buthad since been eaten away by the waves and he says that his fatherhad told him the same thing therefore as you say in many hundredsof years even hills if the stone were soft might also be wornaway</s>  there we are rounding the point and beyond there are no morecliffs doubtless it is in this bay that the shipmaster edred thinksto anchor</s> at that moment their conversation was cut short by a tremendousgust of wind rushing down the sloping hill into the bay strikingthem with such terrible force that the ship heeled over until thewater rushed above the bulwark</s>  the men were thrown against eachother and several fell down to leeward</s>  the confusion was heightenedby the fact that the great sail which was but loosely furled toits yard burst the ropes and the wind catching it buried the craftstill further and she would have filled and sunk had not theshipmaster seized the tiller and aided by the two sailors therepushed it up and so the boats head payed off from the wind andran before it</s> the master shouted to the men to lower the sail which was bellyingand flapping violently but before his orders could be obeyed therewas a crash</s>  the mast snapped off at the slings of the yard andthe wreck fell over the bow of the boat</s>  all hands were employedfor some minutes in getting the sail on board and furling it to itsyard which was laid lengthways along the thwarts</s>  it was foundthat three men standing in the bows had been killed and severalothers badly hurt</s>  the vessel was by this time some distance fromshore</s>  nothing could be done until she was freed of the water withwhich she was nigh halffull and all hands were employed in bailingit out</s> the squall had increased rather than lessened in fury and by thetime the water was cleared out they were two miles from the headland</s> orders were then given to man the oars again but it was found thatseveral of these had been lost having been washed away when themen leapt up believing that the boat would capsize or had slippedfrom the rowlocks unnoticed while they were engaged in getting inthe sail</s>  this was a serious misfortune for every oar was neededto force her through the water in the teeth of the wind which wasblowing directly off shore</s>  the remaining oars were all doublebankedharold himself and his thanes taking their places among the rowers</s> for an hour they laboured their hardest but at the end of thattime they were farther from shore than when they began the forceof the wind acting on the poop and broad hull driving her seawardfaster than the rowers could force her shoreward</s>  the sea toowas now getting up and the motion of the vessel rendered itincreasingly difficult to row</s>  edred left his place at the tillerand went forward to harold</s> my lord he said it is useless</s>  in spite of your efforts we aredrifting farther and farther out and from the look of the sky ifear that we are going to have a great gale and there is nothingto do but to set a little sail and to run before it</s>  maybe therewill presently be a shift of wind which may enable us to make forshore</s>  at present you are but exhausting yourselves in vain andthe sea will soon get up so much that it will be impossible to usethe oars</s> so be it harold replied and at the masters orders the oarswere laid in and the men prepared to get sail upon her</s>  a sailorclimbed up the mast and fastened the stays close to the point whichwas broken off</s>  then another joined him and a block was lashed tothe mast just below the stays and the halliards were rove throughit then edred brought out a small sail and this was hoisted andthe vessel which had before been rolling heavily began to glideswiftly through the water</s>  they had had the satisfaction of seeingthat their consorts although like themselves nearly capsized bythe squall had suffered no damage but after lowering their sailsand yards to the deck had succeeded in rowing into the bay theirlighter hull and draught enabling the oars to drive them throughthe water in the teeth of the wind</s> she is going along finely now wulf said</s> yes beorn agreed but before night there is like to be a seathat will try her</s> harold held a consultation with the master and presently all themen were called to work</s>  the great sail was unrolled from its yardand a portion cut off somewhat wider than the beam of the boatand in length reaching from the bow to the mast</s>  nails and hammerswere brought up from the little cabin and the canvas was stretchedfrom bulwark to bulwark and strongly nailed to the wood on eitherside oars being first lashed across at short intervals to supportit</s> i suppose that is for us to lie under master wulf</s>  osgod said</s> it is a pity it was not erected before for there is not a man onboard who is not drenched to the skin</s> it is not put there to keep you dry osgod but to keep the wavesfrom coming into the ship</s>  but she goes over them well</s>  the windis getting up osgod and we shall have a great sea presently</s> then why dont we turn and sail back again</s>  it seems to me to befolly to be running away from the land if such is going to be theweather</s> how can we sail back again</s>  do you not see that it is the windthat is blowing us off and the vessel must go as the wind takesher</s>  one can go a little this way or that but no man ever yetsailed in the teeth of the wind</s> this is the first time i have ever been to sea osgod said andi trust it will be the last</s>  the tossing of the ship makes mestrangely giddy and many of the servants are downright ill withit</s>  why men should go on the water when they can walk upon the landis more than i can say</s>  i think i will go and lie down under theshelter of the sail for indeed i feel as if i were about to die</s> wulf himself was feeling strangely uncomfortable</s>  as long as theyhad been at work he had not felt unwell for the necessity of holdingon to the bulwarks or ropes and the excitement of their strangeposition had saved him from experiencing many qualms but both heand beorn were soon glad to follow osgods example and to lie downon the boards under the rowers benches</s>  fiercer and fiercer blewthe wind more and more violent became the motion of the shipmasses of water fell on the canvas forward as she plunged into thewaves and would have soon beaten it in had it not been for thesupport of the oars</s>  by evening most of the men were lying underthe shelter while harolds brother and friends had retired to thelittle cabin in the stern</s>  the earl himself remained by the sideof the shipmaster who had taken his place close to the tillerwhich was worked by four men</s> think you that she will weather it edred</s> i have little fear about that my lord</s>  she is a staunch boat andi have been aboard her in seas as heavy as this</s>  besides thatthought of yours of stretching the canvas across her bow has greatlyimproved her chances</s>  the water runs off as fast as it falls on itand none comes on board</s>  had it not been for this every man wouldhave had to bail all night</s>  no i have no fear of her weatheringthe gale</s>  what i am afraid of is that if this wind continues toblow we shall assuredly be lost on the coast of normandy</s> that would be an ill fortune indeed for i know that the normanscount all that are cast on their shores as lawful prey and evenif we reach the land in safety and escape murder at the hands ofthe lord of the soil and his people i may fall into the hands ofduke william who is assuredly no friend of mine seeing that istand in the way of his designs upon the throne of england</s>  trulyit was an evil moment when the thought of taking to the sea occurredto me and i would give a broad slice of my earldom to be back atbosham</s> hour by hour the waves increased in size and violence and oftenpoured in over the sides</s>  the number of men on board was too greatfor all to work effectively</s>  they therefore were divided into twoparties one being engaged in bailing while the other lay undercover the change being made every hour</s>  wulf preferred workingto lying still for as the craft rolled the water washed over themwhile the din of the waves striking the ships side and the cataractsof spray falling on to the canvas above were deafening and it wasimpossible to get a moments sleep</s>  all were glad when morningbroke although the scene that met their eyes was the reverse ofcomforting</s>  small as was the amount of sail the vessel tore throughthe water under the pressure of the following wind</s>  great waveswith white crests pursued her and as they neared her stern itseemed to wulf that they must inevitably fall over and crush her</s> the spray torn from the crest by the wind filled the air</s>  the windshrieked in the cordage and the vessel creaked and groaned as sherolled from side to side</s> i would not have believed if i had not seen it that the sea couldbe so violent and illbehaved wulf shouted to osgod who was thenstanding beside him</s> if my clothes were but dry and my stomach full i would not mindso much osgod replied but to be drenched in water all night andto have nought to eat in the morning takes the courage out of onemightily</s>  how long think you will this go on</s> that no one can say</s>  it may last two or three days</s> and no food all that time</s>  osgod exclaimed in dismay</s> we could stand that well enough osgod but i do not think thereis much chance of our being called upon to do so for i heard oneof the sailors say that unless the storm abates marvellously we arelikely to be cast upon the french coast before nightfall</s> i should be glad to be cast anywhere so it were out of this</s>  atleast whether it be france or england there must be food to behad on shoreyou do not understand osgod</s>  unless we happen to be cast upon ashelving coast with sand or gravel the craft may be dashed to piecesand all lose their lives for assuredly none could swim long insuch a sea as this</s> well we must hope that we shall find a shore such as you speakof osgod said tranquilly but for my part i am content to takethe risk rather than wait another three days before getting anythingto eat</s> and i would rather fast for a week than run the risk of the shipbeing broken up on the rocks wulf replied</s>  i can swim but littleeven in calm water and i am sure that i could do nothing amongthose waves</s> i can swim and will look after you osgod said confidently</s>  iused to swim every day in the thames</s> wulf shook his head</s>  i daresay you might look after me if i fellinto the thames osgod but it is a very different thing in a sealike this</s>  these waves would dash a swimmer hither and thither asif he were but a chip of wood besides the spray would smotherhim</s>  even at this height above the water it is difficult to breathewhen one turns round and faces the wind</s>  i think that our onlyhope lies in running upon a flat shore where the waves will washthe vessel up so high that we may be able to leap out from the bowon to the land beyond the reach of their fury</s> late in the afternoon one of the sailors on the poop astern shoutedout that land was visible and it was not long before it could beseen from the deck</s>  all eyes were directed anxiously towards it</s> it is a rocky coast edred said but the rocks are not high andif we can manage to direct the vessel between two of them we mayescape</s>  at present it is needful that most of the crew should keepin the stern but when we are about to strike they must all runsuddenly forward so as to leap out as soon as she touches theground</s>  there will be but little time given to them for assuredlythe seas will batter her to pieces the moment she falls among therocks</s> harold issued the order</s>  all were to remain at their posts untilhe gave the word and were then to run forward</s>  the master scannedthe shore anxiously</s> see you my lord that opening right ahead of us</s>  it seems to mebarely the width of the ship but if i can direct her truly betweenthe rocks methinks that most of the crew will gain the land</s>  i shallmyself take the helm</s>  that is my duty and my right and should inot succeed in making the shore i shall at least die well contentedwith the thought that you who are the hope of england will be saved</s> i would fain stay with you edred</s> that cannot be my lord</s>  as it is my duty to stay by the ship tothe last so it is your first duty to save your life for england</s> i need no aid for the vessel steers well and by the help of arope round the tiller i can manage her alone</s>  farewell my lordif we are not to meet again on earth</s>  a very few minutes will decideour fate</s> swimming will be of no use there osgod wulf said</s>  look howthe spray dashes itself against the black rocks</s> i thought not that it would be so bad osgod replied</s>  i wonderthe master does not cast anchor</s> the ropes would not hold for a moment wulf said and when theybroke we might drift broadside on to the rocks which would meandestruction for all</s>  the master is steering for that narrow openingbetween these two great rocks ahead</s>  it will be but two or threeminutes now before our fate is decided</s> at this moment harold shoutedlet each man make his peace with god</s>  and baring his head he stoodsilently for a minute or two imitated by all on board</s>  then haroldagain raised his voice in a shout that was heard above the stormmove forward now all of you but not further forward than the mastfor if her head were too far down the master could not hold herstraight</s>  moreover the mast will assuredly fall forward and crushthose in front of it</s>  therefore let no man go forward of it untilthe ship strikes</s> the sailors had already cut away the canvas stretched across thebow and all on board clustered just aft the mast</s>  wulf looked backand saw the master standing alone on the poop with his eyes fixedin front of him and a look of grim resolve on his face</s>  then heturned again to look ahead</s>  the scene was terrible</s>  on either sideextended a long line of white foam</s>  great masses of water werehurled against the rocks with a thundering crash and the sprayflew high up into the air and then caught by the wind was carriedfar inland</s>  the rocks were now but a few lengths ahead and thepassage between them looked terribly narrow so narrow that hedoubted if the ship could possibly pass through them</s>  not a wordwas spoken on board as the ship neared the opening</s>  now she swerveda little to one side now a little to the other as the waves liftedher stern and swept her along but the hand of the master checkedher immediately and brought her head back to the line</s> she was but a length away from the passage when there was a crashthat shook her from stem to stern then another great wave liftedher and wulf saw a black wall of rock gleaming with the water thatstreamed down it</s>  the wall of rock flashed past the bulwarks soclosely that he could have touched it a moment later the ship struckagain this time with a force that threw many off their feet whilethe mast fell over the bow</s>  then once more she lifted shot a fewfeet further then struck with tremendous force and remainedstationary</s> there was a grinding and splintering of planks as the men rushedforward and then a wave swept over the vessel carrying all ondeck before it into the cove beyond the rock rolling them over andover up a sandy shore behind</s>  some managed to dig their hands andfeet into the sand and to scramble out more were sucked back againby the receding waters</s>  as wulf found himself in the water he felthis arm clutched and osgod shouted in his ear do not strugglei can keep you up</s> when thrown up on the sand wulf tried in vain to resist the backwardrush of the water he and osgod were borne out again</s>  when the nextwave again swept them up wulf saw the earl standing kneedeep inthe water and as he was swept past harold seized him and osgodand with tremendous strength lifted them right out of the water</s> keep still</s>  he shouted your weight will help me to keep myfeet</s>  wulf felt his supporter quiver as the water rushed out forhe was waistdeep now but directly afterwards he set them bothdown on their feet saying run before the next wave comes</s>  tenyards farther and they were beyond the reach of the sea</s>  haroldwas with them and directed those who had got ashore to form linestaking hold of each others hands and so to advance far into thesurf and grasp their comrades as they were swept up</s>  many were savedin this way although some of the rescuers were badly hurt byfloating pieces of wreckage for the vessel had entirely broken upimmediately after her course had been arrested</s> as soon as all who could be seen were brought ashore it was foundthat ten men were missing among whom was the master of the shipmost of them having probably been struck by floating timbers</s>  assoon as it was certain that no more would come ashore alive haroldcalled the men together</s>  rough litters were made of oars and piecesof sail for the conveyance of those who had broken limbs or weretoo much injured to walk and the party prepared for a start</s>  bythis time several men apparently of the fishing class had approachedbut stood a short distance away evidently waiting for the departureof the party before beginning the work of collecting whatever thesea might cast up</s>  harold went over to them and asked in the normantonguewhat shore is this and how far is it to the nearest town wherewe can obtain shelter and assistance</s> you are in ponthieu in the territories of count conrad</s>  the townof st</s>  valery is but two miles along the coast</s>  there you can obtainall you need</s> returning to his men harold ordered the wounded to be raised andthe party at once set out</s>  harold had already taken off his goldchain and rings and had told his companions to do the same inorder that the cupidity of the natives might not be excited northeir rank guessed at</s>  as soon as they started wulf went up to him</s> my lord he said i fear that you have already been recognizedby one of the fishermen</s>  i saw him looking earnestly at you andthen whisper to one of his companions</s>  after doing so he hurriedaway</s> that is bad news wulf but i could hardly expect that i shouldbe long unrecognized</s>  there are many vessels come and go betweenthe northern ports and our own and in st</s>  valery there must benumbers of sailors and fishermen who have seen me in london</s>  besideswe are sure to be questioned by the count as to our rank andcondition and even could we conceal it for a while the news iscertain to be brought ere long from england of our having been blownoff the coast and when it was known it would be speedily guessedthat we were the missing party</s>  hark you wulf i have never heardaught good of count conrad and one cannot say what steps he maytake to force us to pay a heavy ransom but it is like enough thathe will do all he can to prevent the news of my being in his handsfrom reaching the ears of the duke</s>  it is likely that you and beornbeing but lads will be watched less rigorously than the rest ofus</s>  should this be so try if you find an opportunity to send thenews to the duke that we are all held prisoners here</s>  i shall ofcourse endeavour to communicate with him but some chance may occurby which you can do so more readily than i can</s> i will try to do so my lord but i trust this norman count willtreat you with all due honour and courtesy</s> wulf then fell back to beorns side and half an hour later theshipwrecked party entered the gates of st</s>  valery</s>  the townspeopleflocked round them and as soon as they learned that they were aparty of shipwrecked saxons who had been blown by the gale fromengland they were led to the house of the officer in command ofthe town</s>  he asked them a few questions saying i must refer thematter to the count</s>  by the usages of our land all who are castupon it become his prisoners to be put to ransom or otherwise ashe may decide</s>  however food shall be supplied you at once butyou must be content to remain under guard until his pleasure isknown</s> they were accordingly at once placed in a disused granary underthe charge of a strong guard</s>  food was brought to them and as soonas they had consumed this most of the men threw themselves on theground worn out by their long exertions</s> this is a sorry welcome wulf after our escape from the seabeorn said</s>  truly the land seems as inhospitable as the ocean</s> it is not pleasant beorn but at present i feel so thankful formy escape from those terrible waves that even the thought that weare all prisoners to this petty noble does not greatly concern me</s> doubtless william of normandy who is the liege lord of the landwill speedily take us out of his hands</s>  were we alone it may bethat we should suffer a long stay in his dungeons but harold andhis brother are far too important personages to be allowed to remainin the hands of one of the dukes vassals</s> it is shameful beorn said indignantly</s>  i do not say that thosewho are cast on our shores may not be often pillaged and illtreatedby the common folk but surely none of gentle blood would fail toshow them kindness and hospitality</s> that is so on our coast of sussex but i have heard that furtherwest and certainly among the danes of northumbria vessels caston the coast are considered as gifts from the sea and even thelives of those who gain the shore are not often respected</s>  i regretmuch that harold should be with us</s>  it is true that his being herewill doubtless shorten the term of our imprisonment but it isunfortunate that he should fall into the hands of william who isas famous for craft and subtlety as he is for bravery and skill asa leader</s> but what can he gain from harold</s>  beorn asked</s>  our earl iswellnigh as much known throughout europe as william of normandyand all christendom would cry out with shame were he treated withought but courtesy by the duke</s> i doubt not that he will treat him with courtesy beorn but hemay well wring some concessions from him before he lets him depart</s> he may bargain that the normans may be again allowed to hold landin england and to build their castles as they did before godwinand his sons returned from exile and the normans had to fly theland save those around the person of the king</s>  he may beg so manybishoprics for norman priests</s>  there is no saying what concessionshe may extort</s>  of all princes in europe i had rather harold hadfallen into the hands of any other than into those of william ofnormandy</s> truly i have never troubled my head about such matters wulf andthought that it would be time to do so when i became a thane andhad a vote at the witan</s> i have heard much of them from the prior of bramber who is a trueenglishman and though a priest learned in all matters that appertainto the history of times past and of our own he impressed upon methat just as a boy must practise arms if he is to bear them worthilyas a man so he should study the story of our kings and learn whatis passing not only in our own country but in others if he isever to raise his voice in council</s> harold and his thanes sat apart discussing the position theirconclusion being very similar to that arrived at by wulf</s>  chivalryhad but slight influence as yet in the west of europe</s>  kings andprinces cared little as to the means by which they attained an end</s> rivals to a throne were put out of the way without scruple theprofession of arms was a business like any other carried on forgain a captured foe was valued chiefly for the amount of ransomthat could be obtained for him petty barons and powerful noblesalike levied exactions on those who might fall into their handsunless previously provided with a safeconduct</s>  years later whenking richard was made a prisoner on his return from the holy landit was only because of his great exploits for the recapture of theholy sepulchre that any feeling of reprobation was excited againsthis captors</s>  thus then although normandy was at peace with englandit did not seem an unnatural thing to harold and his companionsthat the noble into whose hands they had fallen should demand aheavy ransom or that the duke of normandy himself should utilizethe opportunity for his advantage</s> on the following morning they heard a large body of horsemen rideup</s>  a minute later the governor accompanied by a norman nobleentered</s>  they were followed by a number of menatarms among whomwas a fisherman</s> now fellow the count said to this man which is the saxonharold</s> i am harold said advancing a step before his companions</s>  iam harold earl of wessex</s>  i have with my companions been cast onyour shores</s>  i expect honourable treatment and am willing to payany reasonable ransom should you demand one</s> we will talk of that afterwards the count said roughly for thepresent you go with me to my castle at beaurain</s>  but first do youand your men hand over all valuables that you may possess they areforfeited to me being cast up on my land</s> without a word harold produced his chain of office and otherornaments and dropped them into a helmet which a soldier at theorders of the count held out for them</s>  his companions did the samethe thanes first and then the two lads</s> that will do the count said to the soldiers</s>  that is my shareyou can search the rest yourselves</s> i protest against this robbery harold said haughtily and willproclaim you in all the courts of europe as one who is false to hisstation and who condescends to pillage those whom fortune has caston his shores</s> you can wait until you get an opportunity to do so the countsneered it is not likely to come for some time</s>  you can do as youlike to the others he went on to the governor i want not to becumbered with them</s>  you can doubtless find work for them on thefortifications but if you can put them to no use or they aretroublesome cut their throats and throw them into the sea</s> the saxons fingered their knives but harold said in their owntongue resistance would be folly the time may come when we mayturn the tables on this fellow</s>  the soldiers now closed roundharold and the thanes and led them out of the house</s>  here they wereordered to mount each behind a soldier and as soon as they haddone so they rode out from st</s>  valery and crossing the river sommeat abbeville and the authie by a ford near crecy reached thefortress of beaurain on the river canche near the town of hesdinbefore nightfall</s>  on the road wulf watched anxiously for a chanceto escape but none offered itself</s>  soldiers rode on both sides ofthe captives and had he slipped from the horse he could not havehoped to make his escape across an open country</s>  as soon as theyentered the fortress harold and the thanes were all consigned todungeons but the count learning that the two lads had been haroldspages said they should wait on himself</s>  and see he said to themthat your service is good if you do not wish to dangle over themoat at the end of a rope</s> it is a shame that such a man should be a nobleman beorn exclaimedindignantly to wulf as he saw that the soldiers were placing chainsupon harold before they led him away</s> he is a hatefullooking villain wulf said</s>  it is but latelythat he revolted against william</s>  i heard of it from the prior</s>  hisbrother the last count of ponthieu joined france in an invasionof normandy</s>  he fell in an ambush at st</s>  aubin and this man becamecount</s>  for a time he was held prisoner by the duke but afterwardshe was freed and received back his dominions as a vassal</s>  his faceis at once cruel and base</s>  i told you the instructions harold gaveme beorn the need for carrying them out has arrived and i willtry to make my escape without loss of time from this fortress tobear the tidings to the duke</s> i will escape with you wulf two can get on better than one</s> that is so beorn and i would gladly have you with me but maybei shall be detected in attempting to escape and be slain or i mayfall into the hands of peasants and be brought back here and ifwe were together all hope of letting the duke know of our lordscaptivity would be at an end</s>  therefore it were best that i madethe attempt first</s>  if i fail which is like enough then do you inturn try to get away and bear the news to the duke</s> beorn did not like to stay behind but he saw that wulfs plan wasbest and accordingly fell in with it</s> will you go at once</s>  he asked</s> no i will stay for a day or two to lull suspicion</s>  they may watchus just at first but if they see that we do as we are ordered withgoodwill they will cease to regard us so narrowly moreover itwill be needful to know the place well before i devise a plan ofescape</s> chapter v</s> rouen</s> for the next two days the lives of the two young saxons were wellnighunbearable</s>  at meals the count by turns abused and jeered at themand his companions following his example lost no opportunity ofinsulting them in every way</s> if this goes on wulf beorn said as they threw themselves downon the ground late that night when the carousal was ended i shallsnatch the counts dagger from his belt and bury it in his heartthough they put me to death by torture afterwards</s> i thought of doing so myself beorn tonight when he threw a cupof wine over me</s>  but i said to myself my life is not my own haroldsrescue depends on it</s>  we are bound as his men to suffer in patiencewhatever may befall us</s>  in another hour i shall try to make myescape</s>  when it was your turn to wait this evening i stole away fora time and went to the shed where they keep the warengines andtook thence a coil of rope which i have hidden in the courtyard</s> you know that we noticed last night where the sentries were placedand decided where i might best drop from the wall unobserved</s> fortunately the moat is dry at present though they can turn waterinto it from the stream at will so that once down i shall have nodifficulty in getting away</s>  now i want you to go to sleep directlyi shall not stir until you do so then when you are questioned inthe morning you can say that i was by your side when you went tosleep and that when you woke in the morning the place was vacant</s> you can say that i told you during the day that i could not sufferthese insults much longer and that you suppose that after you hadgone to sleep i must have got up and either killed myself or insome way made my escape</s> beorn lay quiet for a time and then wulf said suddenly i havechanged my mind beorn we will go together</s>  i feel it is likelythat in his wrath at my escape the count may slay you and thus theobject with which you remained behind would come to nothing thereforeit is best that you go with me</s> i was thinking so myself wulf though i would not say it but intruth i think the risks we may run in making our way to rouen aresmall compared to those of staying here</s> we must lose no time beorn</s>  the castle is quiet now and we mustbe many miles away from here before morning for you may be surethe counts horsemen will scour the country far and wide in pursuitof us</s> they had that morning before the count was up and their serviceswere required wandered about the fortress apparently paying noattention to anything but really closely observing the approachesto the walls and the general features of the country outside</s>  theynow stole out keeping in the shadow of the building until theyreached the staircase leading up to the battlements close to thepoint wulf had fixed upon for making their descent</s>  this had beenchosen chiefly because no sentry was placed on that part of thewall the watch generally being careless as normandy was at presentat peace with its neighbours</s>  when they reached the top of the stepsthey listened for a short time but everything was silent</s>  thenthey stepped out on to the narrow pathway along the battlementsfastened one end of the rope round a piece of stonework and let theother end drop down into the fosse</s> shall we both go down together the rope is strong enough</s>  beornasked</s> it is strong enough but we had better go separately beorn weare neither of us accustomed to climb ropes and if the upper onewere to slip down too fast he might knock the other off the rope</s> it makes no matter who goes first</s>  i will if you like only mindif you hear a footstep approaching let yourself down at once whetheri am off the rope or not</s>  be sure and twist your legs tightly roundit or it will run through your fingers</s> taking hold of the rope he at once swung himself over and withoutmuch difficulty reached the bottom in safety</s>  he had scarcely doneso when beorn came down beside him with a rush</s> what made you come down like that you narrowly missed coming onmy head</s> i believe i have cut my fingers to the bone beorn groaned ifeel as if i were holding a bar of hot iron</s>  you had scarcely startedbefore i heard voices they were evidently those of men going theirrounds so i caught hold of the rope and swung myself off butbefore i got my legs fairly round the rope i began to slip andthough i gripped it as hard as i could i could not stop myself butslid down like lightning</s> hush</s>  wulf whispered they are coming along above</s>  the voicescame nearer until they sounded directly overhead wulf knew that itwas very unlikely they would notice the rope in the dark but hefelt much relieved as he heard them pass on</s>  he waited until theycould no longer be heard</s> now beorn we can safely be off</s> it was muddy at the bottom of the fosse but not so deep as theythought it would be and they scrambled up the opposite side andthen struck across the country south</s>  presently they came upon aroad which they followed until after three hours walking theyreached the authie river at a spot where the bank was broken down</s> this must be a ford we had best try to wade across</s>  anyhow therecannot be very many yards to swim and we can both manage that</s> they found that the bottom was pebbly and that even in the middlethe water was not much above their waists</s> that is something done at any rate beorn said</s>  now which wayshall we go</s>  this road we are on seems to lead south and we cannotdo better than follow it the stars give us light enough now thatour eyes are accustomed to the darkness</s> yes we can keep this road which is no doubt that by which wetravelled before as far as the village which i heard them callnoyelle then we shall have to strike off to the left for thatplace was not far from abbeville and shall have to follow the sommeup some distance unless we can find means of crossing it</s> i should think we had better leave the road before we get to thevillage so as to be well away from it</s>  if any peasant were goingto work early and caught sight of us he would be sure to mentionit to any horseman who might come along searching for us</s>  i noticedthat there were several woods on our right as we rode along</s> that would be the safest way no doubt wulf agreed</s>  fortunatelywe can do without food for tomorrowfor both had managed to getsome supper after they had finished in the halland having madeup my mind to escape tonight i hid away a large piece of breadunder my smock</s>  we can manage very well on that</s> accordingly after an hours walking they left the road and bore tothe southwest</s>  but little of the land was cultivated and theywere fortunate in not coming upon any woodland until light beganto break in the sky</s>  then they made their way to the nearest woodwent in for some distance and then threw themselves down and in afew minutes were fast asleep</s>  accustomed to judge time by theposition of the sun they saw when they awoke that it was alreadypast noon and after eating a few mouthfuls of bread they continuedtheir journey</s>  for the most part their course lay among woods andthey did not venture across an open piece of country until after acareful examination to see that no one was in sight</s> shortly after starting they caught sight of a village in the distancewhich they afterwards learned was st</s>  riguier but with theseexceptions saw no human habitation</s>  late in the afternoon they camedown on the bank of the somme</s>  this was thickly covered with longreeds and rushes and among these they sat down and ate the restof their bread confident that however vigilant the search theywould not be traced</s> this is a very different matter to the last crossing beorn said</s> this is a wide river and i fear that i could not swim across it</s> nor should i like to try</s>  but fortunately there is no occasion forus to trust to swimming for we can pull up or break off a numberof these great rushes and make them into two bunches these willgive us ample support for our passage</s> so they will wulf i should never have thought of that</s> two large bundles were soon made the reeds being tied together bya tough climber that wreathed itself everywhere among them and assoon as it was quite dark they went down to the waters edge andfound to their satisfaction that the reeds possessed ample buoyancyfor their purpose</s>  wading in they started swimming resting theirchests on the reeds and striking out with their legs and in a fewminutes were on the southern bank of the river</s> now we must make to the east of south wulf said</s>  i should sayif we walk steadily all night we shall be beyond the territory ofthis vile count</s>  i hope before long we shall strike on some roadleading in the right direction for if we get among the woods againwe shall be able to make no progress</s>  but any road we may come upongoing at all in the right direction is likely to lead to rouen</s> how far is it do you think</s> i have a very vague idea</s>  the prior had a map of normandy and onthis he pointed out to me how the duchy had grown since williamcame as a boy to be its duke</s>  i can remember the general positionof the town but not more than that</s>  i should think from the sommeto rouen must be over seventy miles and less than a hundred butmore closely than that i cannot guess</s> they came upon no road before morning but as the country was openthey made good progress and when they lay down in a thicket as theday was breaking they calculated that they must be nearly thirtymiles south of the somme</s> i feel that i want sleep beorn said but still more that i wantfood</s>  if it is another sixty miles to rouen i know not how we aregoing to travel the distance fastingno we must get some food to morrow or rather to day beorn</s>  wehave nothing of any value to offer for it</s>  they searched us tooclosely for anything to escape them</s>  we dare not go into any townor village until we are quite sure that we are beyond the countsterritories but we might enter some solitary hut and pray for apiece of bread for charity or we can walk all day by which timewe shall surely be well beyond the count of ponthieus territoryand could boldly go into a town</s>  if we are seized we can demandto be sent to rouen saying we are bearers of an important messageto duke william and even if they do not send us straight on theywould

the two lads whose garmentsthough stained by sea water and travel were evidently those ofyouths of a class above the common</s>  beorn addressed her in her ownlanguage and told her that they were wayfarers who had lost theirroad and were grievously in need of food</s>  she at once invited themto come in and set before them some black bread and some cheesemade from goats milk</s>  they learned to their satisfaction that theyhad long passed the limits of ponthieu and that rouen was distantabout fifty miles</s> the road from amiens lies five miles to the east she said butit would be shorter for you to keep due south for it inclines inthat direction</s>  you will strike it after seven miles walking andafter that you cannot miss your way</s> after warmly thanking the woman for her hospitality the lads againstarted feeling greatly strengthened and refreshed by their mealbut want of sleep told upon them and when they got within sightof the road they again lay down and slept until the sun was setting</s> resuming their journey they followed the road and before morningcrossed over a range of hills and presently arrived at a smallhamlet close to which was a monastery</s>  towards this they directedtheir steps and seating themselves on the ground near the doorwaited until it was unbarred</s> you are early wayfarers my sons the monk who opened the gatessaid as they went up and you seem to have travelled far</s> that have we father and are sorely in need of food</s> the hospitality of the monasteries was unbounded and the monk atonce led them into the kitchen where bread

noughtto eat save a crust of bread we had brought with us and some thata shepherds wife bestowed upon us out of charity and we havewalked from near hesdin</s> i do not ask out of curiosity my sons the monk said after apause and you know it is not our custom to question wayfarers whocome in to ask our hospitality but it is strange to see two youthswho by their dress and manner seem to belong to a superior stationin so pitiable a state as you are and wandering alone as it wouldseem penniless through the country</s>  i ask not your confidence butif you chose to give it maybe we might aid or advise you</s>  our prioris a kindly man and very gentle with the faults of others</s> we are saxons father</s>  we were wrecked four days since near st</s> valery and are now bound on an errand of high importance to dukewilliam to whom it is urgent we should arrive as soon as possible</s> we have run sore peril on the way and have been stripped of ourmoney and valuables</s> is your mission of importance to the duke as well as to yourselves</s> the monk asked gravely</s> it is of great importance to him</s>  i am sure that he would considerthat any one who assisted us on our way had done him good service</s> the monk look earnestly at them</s>  i will speak to the prior hesaid</s>  he returned in a few minutes and bade them follow him</s> the prior was a tall gentle old man</s>  i have heard your story frombrother gregory he said and i wished to see you that i mightjudge for myself whether so strange a tale as that two shipwreckedboys should have important business with our duke could be believedbefore i did aught to help you forward</s>  you look to me honest ofpurpose and of gentle blood and not i am sure belonging to theclass of wayfarer who will trump up any story for the purpose ofgaining alms</s>  whether your errand with the duke is of the importanceyou deem it i cannot say but if you give me your word that youconsider it an urgent matter i will aid you to proceed at once</s> we do indeed consider it most urgent father and we are sure thatthe duke will so regard it</s>  we should not have walked wellnigh ahundred miles in two days and nights and that almost without foodhad we not deemed it so</s> brother gregory the prior said bid laybrother philip at onceprepare three palfreys and tell him he is to ride himself withthese two saxon youths to rouen</s>  the distance is thirty miles hewent on as the monk left the room</s>  it is not yet six oclock andthough our palfreys are not accustomed to travel at rapid speedyou will be there this afternoon in time to have audience with theduke</s> the lads returned their warm thanks to the prior</s>  we would gladlytell you the purport of our mission beorn said but we are onlythe bearers of news and the duke might be displeased did he knowthat we had confided to any before it reached his own ear</s> i wish not to learn it my son</s>  it is sufficient for me that youhave a mission to our duke and that i am possibly furthering hisinterest by aiding you to reach him</s>  but in sooth i am more movedby the desire to aid two stranger youths whom the sea and man alikeseem to have treated

would have been beyond hisjurisdiction</s>  i fear that all the seacoast people view the goodsobtained from vessels cast ashore as a lawful prey but your companywould assuredly have received fair hospitality if cast on the shoresof normandy itself</s>  but now methinks i hear the patter of thepalfreys hoofs</s>  farewell my sons and may god who has protectedyou through these dangers give you his blessing</s> the lads knelt before him as he placed his hands on their heads andgave them his benediction</s>  as they rose brother gregory entered tosay that the horses were ready and with renewed thanks to the priorthey followed him to the courtyard mounted and rode off with thelaybrother glad indeed to find their journey on foot thus abridged</s> impatient as they were to reach rouen

the subprior and othermatters of great interest to himself but of none to the boys whosethoughts were with harold chained and in prison</s>  the palfreyshowever made very fair progress and it was but three oclock whenthey rode into the streets of rouen whose size and grandeur wouldat any other time have impressed them much for it was an incomparablyfiner city than london</s> that is the dukes palace brother philip said as they approacheda stately building</s>  i will put up the horses at the convent at thefarther corner of this square and will then go with you to thepalace as i have orders to tell any officer who may make a difficultyabout you entering that i am bid by the prior of forges to saythat you are here on urgent business with the duke and to praythat you may have immediate audience with him</s> in those days great men were easy accessible and one of the usherson receiving the message from the prior at once led the boys toan apartment in which the duke was sitting</s>  he looked up in somesurprise on seeing the two lads standing bareheaded at the doorwhile the usher repeated the message he had received</s> advance he said</s>  what is this business of which the prior offorges has sent me word</s> the two boys advanced and knelt before the duke</s>  he was a man ofabout the same age as harold with dark hair and complexion lesstall than the earl but of a powerful figure and a stern resoluteface</s>  the boys had discussed among themselves which should be thespeaker</s>  wulf had desired that beorn being the elder should deliverthe message but beorn insisted that as wulf himself had receivedit from harold it was he who should be the one to deliver it tothe duke</s> my lord duke wulf said we are saxons pages of earl haroldand we bring you by his orders the news that the vessel in whichhe was sailing along his coast had been blown off by a tempest andcast on the shore of ponthieu near st</s>  valery and that he andhis companions have been villainously illtreated by conrad countof ponthieu who has seized them and cast them into dungeons in hisfortress of beaurain harold and his companions being fettered likemalefactors</s> the duke was astounded at the news</s>  no greater piece of good fortunecould have befallen him for he had it in his power to lay his greatrival under an obligation to him to show himself a generous princeand at the same time to obtain substantial benefits</s>  he rose atonce to his feet</s> by the host he exclaimed but this is foul treatment indeed ofthe noble earl and brings disgrace alike upon the count of ponthieuand upon me his liege lord</s>  this wrong shall be remedied andspeedily</s>  you shall see that i waste no moment in rescuing yourlord from this unmannerly count</s>  he struck his hand on the tableand an attendant entered pray the knights fitzosberne and warrento come hither at once</s>  and how is it boys he went on as theattendant hurried away that you were enabled to bear this messageto me</s> while harold and his thanes were cast into prison wulf said thecount kept us to wait upon him not for our services but that hemight flout and illtreat us</s>  we obtained possession of a rope andlet ourselves down at night from the battlements and made our wayon foot as far as forges where the good prior learning from usthat we had a message of importance to you though nothing of itsimport sent us forward on palfreys so that no time might be lost</s> when did you leave beaurain</s> it will be three days come midnight wulf said</s> and how did you live by the way</s> we took a piece of bread with us and once obtained food at ashepherds hut and this morning we were well entertained at theconvent of forges</s> you have proved yourselves good and trusty messengers the dukesaid</s>  would i were always as well served</s>  as you are the earlspages you are of course of gentle blood</s> we are both his wards my lord and shall be thanes when we comeof age</s> and how is it that you young sir who seem to be younger thanyour companion are the spokesman</s> it happened thus wulf said modestly</s>  some fishermen came upjust after we had gained the shore with the loss of many of ourcompany</s>  i marked that one of them started on seeing earl haroldand whispered to a companion and feeling sure that he had recognizedmy lord i told the earl of it as we walked towards st</s>  valery</s>  hethen charged me if he was taken prisoner by the count to endeavourto bear the news to you and to give the same orders to my comradebeorn saying it was likely that we might not be so strictly watchedas the men of the company and might therefore succeed in slippingaway as indeed turned out to be the case</s>  i was desirous that beornshould tell you the tale being older and more accustomed to thespeech of the court than i was but he held that the message beingfirst given to me it was i who should deliver it</s> he judged rightly the duke said and deserves credit for thusstanding aside</s> at this moment two knights entered</s>  fitzosberne warren theduke said a foul wrong has been done by conrad of ponthieu toearl harold of wessex the foremost of englishmen next to the kinghimself who has with a company of his thanes been cast ashorenear st</s>  valery</s>  instead of receiving honourable treatment as washis due he has been most foully seized chained and with hisfriends thrown into prison by the count who has sent no intimationof what has taken place to me his lord and had it not been forthese two brave and faithful youths who effected their escape overthe battlements of beaurain in order to bring me the news the earlmight have lingered in shameful captivity</s>  i pray you take horseat once with twenty chosen spears and ride at the top of yourspeed to beaurain</s>  there express in fitting terms to conrad myindignation at his foul treatment of one who should have beenreceived as a most honoured guest</s>  say that the earl and his companymust at once be released and be accorded the treatment due notonly to themselves but to them as my guests and bid the countmount with them and ride to my fortress of eu to which i myselfwill at once journey to receive them</s>  tell conrad that i will accountto him for any fair ransom he may claim and if he demur to obeymy orders warn him that the whole force of normandy shall at oncebe set on foot against him</s>  after having been for two years myprisoner methinks he will not care to run the risk of again beingshut up within my walls</s> we will use all haste fitzosberne said</s>  conrads conduct is adisgrace to every norman noble for all europe will cry shame whenthe news of the earls treatment gets abroad</s>  that conrad shouldhold him to ransom is only in accordance with his strict rightsbut that he should imprison and chain him is by the saints almostbeyond belief</s> as soon as the knights had left the duke sent for his chamberlainand ordered him to conduct beorn and wulf to an apartment and tosee that they were at once furnished with garments befitting youngnobles together with a purse of money for their immediate wants</s> then taking a long and heavy gold chain from his neck he placed iton the table and with a blow with his dagger cut it in sunder andhanded half to each of the lads</s> take this he said in token of my thanks for having brought methis news and remember that if at any time you should have a boonto ask that it is within my power to grant i swear to you upon myducal honour that it shall be yours</s>  never have i received morejoyful news than that the great earl of wessex will shortly be myguest</s> the lads bowed deeply and then followed the chamberlain from theapartment</s> well what think you of it beorn</s>  wulf said when they foundthemselves alone in a handsome chamber</s> so far as rescuing harold from the power of the count of ponthieuwe have surely succeeded even beyond our hopes</s>  as to the rest iknow not</s>  as you were speaking i marked the satisfaction and joyon the dukes face and i said to myself that it was greater thanneed have been caused by the thought that earl harold was to be hisguest</s> so i thought myself beorn</s>  there can be no doubt that as he saidhe deemed it the best news he had ever received and i fear greatlythat harold will but exchange one captivity for another</s>  it willdoubtless be a more pleasant one but methinks harold will findhimself as much a prisoner although treated as an honoured guestby william as he was while lying in the dungeon of conrad</s>  it isa bad business and i greatly fear indeed that harold will long ruethe unfortunate scheme of hunting along the coast that has broughthim to this pass</s> in a short time an attendant arrived with ewers water and foursuits of handsome garments belts embroidered with gold thread anddaggers together with two plumed caps and purses each containingten gold pieces he informed them that two horses had been providedfor their use and that they were to take their meals with thedukes household and to consider themselves in all respects as hisguests</s> we look finer birds than we did when we rode in with brotherphilip beorn laughed when they had attired themselves in theirnew garments</s>  the more sober of these suits are a good deal gayerthan those we wore at home even at court ceremonies</s> king edward objects to show wulf said and his own pages areso sober in their attire that the earl likes not that we shouldoutshine them and we usually cut a poor figure beside those ofwilliam of london and the other normans of his court</s> in a short time the chamberlain came in and informed them thatsupper was served and conducted them to the hall where he presentedthem to the dukes gentlemen and pages as williams guests andwards and pages of the earl of wessex</s>  the news of harolds shipwreckand imprisonment travelled quickly for orders had already beenissued for the court to prepare to start early the next morning toaccompany the duke to eu in order to receive with due honourwilliams guest and friend harold of england and while the mealwent on many questions were asked as to the shipwreck and prisonmentof the earl and the liveliest indignation was expressed at theconduct of conrad of ponthieu</s> truly all normans will be reckoned churls one of the gentlemenexclaimed indignantly</s>  the fame of harolds bravery wisdom andcourtesy to all men is known in every court in europe and that thedukes vassal should have dared to imprison and chain him willexcite universal indignation</s>  why the rudest of our own norseancestors would not have so foully treated one so noble whom fatehad cast into his hands</s>  had we been at war with england it wouldbe shameful but being at peace there are no words that can fitlydescribe the outrage</s> when the meal was over one of the dukes pages who was about thesame age as beorn asked him what they were going to do with themselves</s> if you have nothing better he said will you ride with me tomy fathers castle it is but five miles away</s>
i can promise you a hearty welcome</s>  my father was one of the knightswho accompanied the duke when he paid his visit to england somefifteen years ago and he liked the country much and has ever sincespoken of the princely hospitality with which they were receivedby your king</s>  he did not meet earl harold then</s> no the earl with his father and brothers was away in exile wulfsaid rather shortly for that visit had been a most unpleasant oneto englishmen</s>  it had happened when the norman influence wasaltogether in the ascendant</s>  the king was filling the chief placesat court and in the church with normans had bestowed wide domainsupon them and their castles were everywhere rising to dominate theland</s>  englishmen then regarded with hostility this visit of theyoung norman duke with his great train of knights and although atthe return of godwin and his sons the greater portion of the intrudershad been driven out their influence still remained at court andit was even said that edward had promised the duke that he shouldbe his successor</s> it was true that englishmen laughed at the promise</s>  the king ofengland was chosen by the nation and edward had no shadow of rightto bequeath the throne even to one of his sons much less to a foreignprince who although related to himself by marriage had no dropof english blood in his veins</s>  still that the promise should everhave been made rankled in the minds of the english people the moreso as the power of normandy increased and the ambition as well asthe valour of its duke became more and more manifest according toenglish law the promise was but an empty breath absolutely withouteffect or value</s>  according to norman law it constituted a powerfulclaim and duke william was assuredly not a man to let such a claimdrop unpressed</s> wulf had heard all this again and again and the prior of bramberhad explained it to him in all its bearings showing him that littleas englishmen might think of the promise given by edward so longago it would be likely to bring grievous trouble on the land athis death</s>  he might perhaps have said more in reference to williamsvisit had not beorn at once accepted the invitation to ride withyoung de burg to his fathers castle</s> chapter virelease of the earlin a few minutes the three horses were brought out</s>  wulf and beornwere much pleased with the animals that had been placed at theirservice</s>  they were powerful horses which could carry a knight inhis full armour with ease and seemed full of spirit and fire</s>  theywere handsomely caparisoned and the lads felt as they sprang onto their backs that they had never been so well mounted before</s> you would have made the journey more quickly and easily if you hadhad these horses three days ago young de burg laughed</s> yes indeed</s>  there would have been no occasion to hide in the woodsthen</s>  with our light weight on their backs they would have madenothing of the journey</s> you must not expect to see a castle de burg said presentlythough i call it one</s>  in his early days the duke set himself todestroy the great majority of castles throughout normandy for asyou know he had no little trouble with his nobles and held thatwhile the strength of these fortresses disposes men to engage eitherin civil war or in private feuds with each other they were of noavail against the enemies of the country</s>  my father who is justthe age of the duke was his loyal follower from the first and ofhis free will levelled his walls as did many others of the dukesfriends in the first place because it gave the duke pleasure andin the second because had only the castles of those opposed to theduke been destroyed there would have been such jealousy and animosityon the part of their owners that matters would never have quieteddown in the country</s>  thus it is that throughout the land you willfind but few castles remaining</s>  the nobles felt it strange at firstto be thus dwelling in houses undefended against attack but theysoon learnt that it was far more convenient than to be shut upwithin massive walls and the present dwellings are much larger andmore comfortable than those of former days</s>  the duke said rightlythat the abolition of fortresses wellnigh doubled his fightingpower for that so many men were required to garrison them as togreatly diminish the number their lords could take with them intothe field</s>  you do not have castles in england do you</s> no we live in open houses and hold that it is far better andmore pleasant to do so</s>  there is no fighting between neighbourswith us</s>  the great earls may quarrel and lead their forces into thefield or may gather them against danish and norwegian pirates butexcept on these occasions which are rare all dwell peaceably intheir homes</s> the horses were fresh and the five miles quickly passed over</s> there is the house de burg said pointing to a large buildingstanding on an eminence</s>  it was castellated in form and much ofthe old building had been incorporated with the additions but theouter wall had been pulled down and the moat filled up</s>  broadcasements had replaced the narrow loopholes and though the flagof the de burgs still waved over the keep which stood a littleapart from the rest the family no longer dwelt in it</s> it is chiefly used as a storehouse now guy de burg explainedbut there as you see the old loopholes still remain and in caseof trouble it might be held for a time</s>  but of that however thereis little chance the dukes hand is a heavy one and he has shownhimself a great leader</s>  he has raised normandy wellnigh level withfrance and so long as he lives and reigns there is no fear ofdomestic trouble</s> the gate stood open and they rode into a courtyard when severalmen came out and took the horses</s>  guy de burg ran up a broad staircaseto the entrance of the house itself and passed beneath a nobleentrance with a lofty pointed arch supported by clustered pillars</s> inside was a spacious hall paved with stone and from this de burgturned into an apartment whose walls were covered with rich hangings</s> here a lady was at work embroidering surrounded by several of hermaids similarly engaged</s>  a girl some fourteen years old was readinga missal while the master of the castle was sitting in a chairwith low arms and was playing with the ears of a hound whose headwas lying on his knee</s> well guy what is your news</s>  he asked as his son entered</s>  halfan hour since i received a message from the duke desiring me toappear with ten menatarms in their best trappings to ride withhim to eu</s>  is conrad of ponthieu giving trouble again and who arethese young gentlemen with you</s> guy went down on one knee to kiss his fathers hand and then didthe same to his mother then he said i will with your permissionanswer the last question first father</s>  my friends are young saxonthanes pages to earl harold and at present guests of the duke</s> you are bearers doubtless of some message from the king to ourduke</s> no my lord beorn said we were bearers of a message from earlharold</s> it is to meet him father that we are to ride to eu tomorrow</s> he has been wrecked on the shores of ponthieu and has been foullyimprisoned and even fettered by count conrad</s>  beorn and wulf escapedfrom the prison and brought the news to the duke who this afternoondispatched fitzosberne and warren at full speed to bid the countat once free his prisoners and deliver them over to him at eu underpain of his direst displeasure</s> harold in normandy and a prisoner</s>  this is strange news indeed</s> we shall surely make him welcome for he is in all respects a greatman and save our own duke has a reputation second to none ineurope</s> wulf thought as he looked at the speaker that at least he had nosecond thought in his mind</s>  it was a frank honest face martial inits outline but softened by a pleasant smile</s> he had spoken in a genial tone of affection to his son and wulfthought that although no doubt he was ready to take the field atthe summons of his lord he preferred a quiet life in this statelyhome</s> this is news for you wife he went on</s>  you will have to furbishup your gayest attire for we shall be having grand doings in honourof this great english earl and our dames will have to look theirbest in order that he may carry home a fair report of them to thesaxon ladies</s>  and how did you manage to escape young sirs andwhen did you arrive with the news</s> beorn who as the elder was specially addressed shortly relatedthe story of their escape and journey</s> you have done well the baron said when he had concluded</s>  guyyou may learn from these young saxons that even pages may be calledupon to do work of more importance than handing winecups andstanding behind their lord on state occasions</s>  had it not been fortheir readiness and courage harold might have lain weeks in prisonmaybe months while the count was striving to wring the utmostransom from him</s>  the lads would doubtless have been slain had theybeen detected in making their escape or overtaken on the way andthe attempt was therefore one that required courage as well asdevotion to their lord</s>  i doubt not that you would exhibit bothqualities did opportunity offer but i question whether you couldhave walked the distance they did and that on such scanty fare</s> we normans are too apt to trust wholly to our horses legs to theneglect of our own and although i have no doubt that you couldride as far as a horse could carry you i warrant that you couldhardly have performed on foot the journey from beaurain in twicethe time in which they did it</s>  they must have exercised their legsas well as their arms and although in a campaign a norman nobledepends upon his war horse both on the march and on the day ofbattle there may often be times when it is well that a knightshould be able to march as far as any of the footmen in the army</s> well agnes and what have you to say to these saxon youths</s>  methinksyour eyes are paying more attention to them than to your missal</s> i can read my missal at any hour father but this is the firsttime that i have seen young saxon nobles</s>  i thought there wouldhave been more difference between them and us</s>  their hair is fairerand more golden and their eyes bluer but their dress differs inno way from our own</s>  she spoke in a matteroffact and seriousair as if it were a horse or a dog that she was commenting uponand both beorn and wulf smiled while guy laughed outright</s> it is little wonder that their attire is like ours agnes hesaid seeing that they were furnished with it by the dukes orders</s> you do not suppose that after being tossed about on the sea andwellnigh drowned in landing and being made prisoners and thentravelling through the country and sleeping in the woods beorn andwulf would arrive here with their garments new and spotless</s>  thatwould indeed have been a miracle</s> but indeed beorn said our garments differ not greatly fromthose we now have on for norman fashions are prevalent at kingedwards court and we had no choice but to conform to them</s>  yourlanguage is always spoken there and methinks that were you to visitwestminster you would see but little difference between king edwardscourt and that of your own duke</s> and your sisters do they too dress like us</s> queen ediths ladies dress like her in norman fashion but awayfrom the court the attire is different and more simple</s>  sisterswulf and i have none we are orphans both and wards of earl haroldwho holds our estates until we are of age to take the oaths to himand to lead our men in battle</s> and will you be barons like my father or counts or simple knights</s> we shall be none of these things lady agnes</s>  we have our greatearls as in france you have your great dukes but below that wehave no titles</s>  we are thanes that is land owners who hold theirland direct from our earls</s>  some have wider lands than others butas free thanes we are all equal</s>  as to knights we have not inengland the titles and ceremonies which are so much thought of infrance and in other courts</s> that is a pity the girl said gravely for the vows of knighthoodmake a knight courteous and gentle to enemies and friends alike</s> or rather agnes her mother put in they should do so but intruth looking round at the cruel wars we have had in normandy ido not see that men have been more gentle or courteous than theywould have been had they never taken the vows or had knightly spursbuckled on and in truth it seems to me from the news of what hastaken place beyond the sea that in the civil troubles they havehad in england men are much more gentle with each other and foesare far more easily reconciled than with us in normandy who aresupposed to be bound by the laws of chivalry</s>  had our duke beencast upon the shores of england as harold has been cast upon thatof ponthieu i think that he would not have been so dishonourablytreated by one of the english thanes as harold has been by countconrad</s>  when godwin and his sons returned from the exile into whichthey had been driven and again became all powerful there was notas i have heard from your father a single drop of blood shed norany vengeance taken upon the men who had brought about their exile</s> it would have been very different had such things happened here</s> you speak rightly wife</s>  the english are of a more gentle dispositionthan we are though nowise backward in battle</s>  but now guy itis time that you were returning</s>  you have already made a longerstay than usual</s>  i shall see you again tomorrow when we start foreu</s>  young sirs i hope that on your return you will often ride overhere when your lord does not require you</s>  we shall always be pleasedto see you and although the forest lies some miles away guy canshow you good hunting though not so good as that which as i hearyou can get in england where the population is not so thick as itis in this part of normandy</s> the horses were brought round and the three lads rode into rouenjust as night was falling</s> long before daybreak there was a stir in the streets of the cityas parties of knights and nobles rode in with bodies of theirretainers in obedience to the orders of the duke</s>  all in the palacewere awake early</s>  a hasty breakfast was eaten while just as thesun rose the duke mounted his horse and at the head of an arraycomposed of some twenty barons and knights and four hundredmenatarms rode out of the city</s> there is a good deal more pomp and show here than there was whenwe rode with harold from london wulf said</s>  in truth these normannobles make a far braver appearance in their armour and robes andwith their banners carried behind them than we do</s>  were the kinghimself to ride in state through london he would scarce be so gailyattended</s> duke william does not look as if he cared for show beorn said</s> nor does he guy who was riding beside them put in</s>  for himselfhe is simple in his tastes but he knows that the people are impressedby pomp and love to see a brave cavalcade therefore he insistson the observance of outward forms and his court here on stateoccasions vies as they tell me with that of henry of france</s> where shall we rest tonight</s>  wulf asked</s>  methinks from theappearance of the sky that we shall have rain and unless we sleepunder shelter many of these fine robes that we see are like to beas much dabbled in mud as were those in which we arrived</s> we shall sleep in no town for there is no place on the road betweenthis and eu that could receive so large a party but soon after werode out yesterday a train of waggons with tents and all else needfulstarted from rouen and halfway to eu we shall find the camp erectedand everything in readiness for our reception</s> this was indeed the case</s>  the camp had been erected in a shelteredvalley through which ran a stream that supplied the needs of manand horses</s>  the tents were placed in regular order that of theduke in the centre those of his chief nobles in order of rank oneither side</s>  behind was a line for the use of the court officialspages and knights of less degree while the soldiers would sleepin the open</s>  as the party rode up a chamberlain with three or fourassistants met them</s>  each was provided with lists containing thenames of all the dukes following and these were at once conductedto the tents alloted to them so that in a few minutes all werehoused without the slightest confusion or trouble</s>  the squires ofthe knights and nobles and the attendants of the officers and pagesat once took the horses and picketed them in lines behind the tentsrubbing them down and cleaning them with the greatest care andthen supplying them with forage from the piles that had that morningbeen brought in from the neighbouring farms</s>  fuel in abundance hadalso been stacked</s>  a number of cooks had come on with the tentequipage and supper was already prepared for the duke and hisparty while animals had been slaughtered and cut up and themenatarms soon had the joints hanging over their bivouac fires</s> this is all wonderfully well managed beorn wulf said</s>  i doubtwhether it could be done so well and orderly with us at home</s> what does it matter</s>  beorn said contemptuously</s>  it makes nodifference whether one sups five minutes after arrival or an hour</s> it matters nothing beorn but what is but a question of an hourswaiting in a small party is one of going altogether supperless tobed when it is a large one</s>  the normans have been constantly fightingfor the last twenty years and you see they have learned how importantit is that everything should be regular and orderly</s>  if they managematters with a large force as well as they do with a small one asit is probable that they do see what an advantage it gives to them</s> were two armies to arrive near each other with the intention offighting in the morning and one knew exactly what to do and couldget their food in comfort and then lie down to rest while the otherwas all in confusion no one knowing where he should go or whereto bestow himself and being unable to obtain food forced to liedown supperless the first army would obtain a great advantage whenthey met the next morning especially if it had breakfasted wellwhile the other went into the fight still fasting</s>  look at ourselveshow weak we were that morning when we had lain down hungry and gotup fasting while on the morning when the woman gave us that foodsimple as it was we stepped out boldly and in spirits</s> that is true enough wulf but you know that among us it is saidthat earl harold is always most careful for the comfort of hissoldiers</s> yes the earl always thinks of those around him</s>  as i have neverbeen in the field i know not what the arrangements are but i cannotthink they would be so well ordered in a great gathering of englishmenor that we should manage matters as well as the normans with alltheir experience have learnt to do</s> well wulf beorn laughed you had best study the matter andthen ask the earl to appoint you to take charge of the arrangementswhen he takes the field</s> one could hardly have a more useful office wulf said earnestlybut it would need a man of experience and of high rank and positionfor our saxon thanes are not accustomed to discipline as are thesenorman barons and only one of great authority could induce themto observe regulations and carry out any plan in due order</s> beorn nodded</s>  that is true enough wulf and it is therefore clearthat a good many years must pass before you can properly fill thepost of chief chamberlain to the army</s>  for myself i shall be wellcontent to do what fighting is required and to leave all thesematters in your hands</s> yes but it cant be left in the hands of one officer wulf saidwarmly unless all give their aid willingly to carry out his plans</s> well you need not be angry about it wulf</s>  there will be timeenough for that when you get to be grand chamberlain</s>  you knowwhat the saxon thanes arehow easeloving and averse to troublethemselves with aught save the chase</s>  i would as soon marshal aflock of sheep in military order and teach each to keep its placeas get the thanes to conform to strict orders and regulations</s> and yet beorn said baron de burg who had just entered the tentunnoticed by them in order to speak to his son who with anotherpage shared it with them unless all will conform to strict ordersand regulations an army is but a mere gathering of armed menanimated not by one will but by as many wills as it contains men</s> such an army may be valiant every man may be a hero and yet itmay be shattered to pieces by another which gives itself up whollyto the direction of one will</s>  that is why we normans have so badlybeaten the french</s>  every mail has his place in battle</s>  he chargeswhen he is ordered to charge or he is held in reserve the wholeday and the battle ended without his ever striking a blow</s>  we mayfret under inaction we may see what we think chances of fallingupon the enemy wasted but we know that our duke is a great leaderthat he has a plan for the battle and will carry it through andthat disobedience to his orders would be an offence as great asthat of riding from the field</s>  hence we have learned to obey andconsequently we have always been victorious against men as braveas ourselves but each obeying his own feudal lord and so fightingin detached bodies rather than as a whole</s>  your young companion isin the right</s>  in a duel between two men strength and skill iseverything in a struggle between two armies obedience to ordersis a virtue even higher than bravery and skill at arms</s>  where isguy</s> he is in attendance on the duke my lord beorn said</s>  we presentedourselves also at his tent but he told us that he required no dutyfrom us</s> let him come to my tent when he returns the baron said thatis as soon as he has finished supper</s>  i shall be glad if you willalso come unless the duke sends for you which methinks he is notlikely to do</s>  he is in thoughtful mood today and will probablybe alone</s> two or three other knights were assembled in baron de burgs tentwhen the three lads went in</s>  de burg said a few words to hiscompanions explaining who they were and then continued hisconversation with the others</s>  beorn and wulf as they stood behindthe chairs and listened to the talk could not help being struckwith the difference between it and the conversations they had heardat the houses of saxon thanes</s> with harold they had been accustomed to hear matters of state touchedon</s>  the church and the struggle going on between the norman prelatesand monks on the one hand and the english clergy on the other wasone that was frequently talked over as were also the projectsharold had at heart for encouraging the spread of education andraising the condition of people generally</s>  at the houses of thethanes however the evenings were passed in feasting and song andit was seldom that there was anything like discussion upon generalaffairs</s>  indeed between men heated with wine and accustomed tostate their opinions bluntly anything like friendly argument waswell nigh impossible</s>  de burg and his companions made no allusionat all to public affairs but discussed gravely and calmly andwith a courteous respect for each others opinions questionsconnected with the art of war hunting the changed conditionsbrought about by the demolition of castles the improvements graduallybeing introduced in armour and other kindred topics</s>  the othernobles were men of about the same age as de burg and although thelatters page from time to time carried round wine the goblets wererarely emptied</s> certain topics were touched upon only to be dropped at once andwulf saw that subjects upon which there was any disagreement amongthem were carefully avoided</s> when the boys returned to their tent wulf said their talk remindsme of the evenings i spent with the prior his almoner and two orthree other monks rather than of those at the houses of saxonthanes</s> beorn nodded</s>  i am not so much against our customs of feasting andmerriment as you are wulf and should not care to spend my eveningsoften in listening to such grave talk but truly these norman baronsand knights are far more courteous in their speech than our ownthanes and seem to care but little for the wine cup</s>  i admit thatsuch men must be far wiser advisers for a king than are our saxonssaving of course harold and his brothers</s> the normans are not all so abstemious as my father and those yousaw with him guy laughed</s>  listen</s>  you can hear songs and loudlaughter from many of the tents ay and might hear quarrels toodid you listen long enough</s>  but those you saw were all men high inthe confidence of the duke</s>  they have fought together under hisbanner in many a field and are all powerful barons</s>  they are contentto hold their own and have nothing to gain at the expense of others</s> their value is well established and i believe that all of themwould be well pleased were they never called upon to set lance inrest again methinks this evening they avoided all public questionschiefly because we were present and you see no word was spoken ofthe unexpected accident that has thrown harold on our shoresalthough it must have been in all their minds and doubtless theytalked it over as they rode hither today</s>  i should not be surprisedif my father had us in his tent for the very reason that your beingthere would prevent more being said about it</s>  i do not suppose anyof them know exactly what is in the dukes mindpossibly he hasnot even made it up himself and it is assuredly wise here innormandy to express no strong opinion until the dukes own mind ismanifest</s> i daresay you are right guy</s>  i rather wondered why your fatherhad asked us as well as you to his tent when he had others withhim but it is like enough that he thought our presence would preventany discussion on delicate topics</s> the next morning the cavalcade mounted early and in the afternoonrode into the fortress of eu</s>  it stood upon the river bresle andhad previous to the conquest of ponthieu been the frontier guardof normandy on the north</s>  it lay only some ten miles from the spotwhere the saxon galley had been wrecked</s>  a messenger had arrivedthere early in the day from</s>  fitzosberne saying that conrad ofponthieu had assented to the demand of the duke for the surrenderof his captives that these had been at once released from theirconfinement and were now honourably entertained</s>  they would starton the following morning from beaurain and would be accompaniedby conrad who desired to come to eu to pay his respects to theduke</s> although it had been certain that conrad would not venture to refusethe command of his powerful overlord wulf and beorn were greatlydelighted to hear that harold and his companions had at once beenreleased from their imprisonment and that they would so speedilyarrive at eu</s>  in the afternoon of the following day a messengerarrived stating that the cavalcade was but an hours ride away andpreparations were at once made to receive it with all honour</s>  thegarrison of the castle in their bravest attire lined the courtyardhangings brought from rouen were disposed round the walls of thegreat hall two chairs of state were placed on the dais themenatarms who had come from rouen were drawn up on either sideof the great entrance and here william with his nobles assembledwhen the cavalcade approached the castle</s> the procession was headed by the norman menatarms of fitzosberneand warren</s>  after them rode conrad of ponthieu with harold by hisside</s>  both carried hawks on their wrists and were apparently onthe most amiable terms</s>  behind them rode harolds brother and nephewand the two norman barons they were followed by the saxon thanesand the officers of the counts household</s>  behind these came onfoot the saxons of inferior degree who had been left at st</s>  valeryand who had by conrads orders been sent to join the cavalcade whereit crossed the somme at abbeville the procession was closed by astrong body of the counts menatarms</s>  they rode through the doubleline of spearmen until they reached the entrance</s>  then as harolddismounted the duke descended the steps and embraced him with thewarmest expressions of satisfaction at thus meeting the mostillustrious of englishmen</s> harold replied in suitable terms and the duke then turned to conradand thanked him warmly for having acceded to his request</s> ponthieu was but newly conquered and might yet be a thorn in theside of normandy in the event of a renewal of war with france</s>  itwas therefore to williams interest to treat conrads obedience tohis orders as if it had been a voluntary submission and to ignorehis discourteous treatment of his captives</s>  in order to eradicateall sense of injury on the part of his vassal he not only paid himthe ransom for harold but gave him a considerable grant of territory</s> the duke now presented his nobles and principal officers to haroldand then with his arm placed familiarly on his guests shoulder ledhim into the hall and placed him in the chair of state beside hisown other seats being placed for wulfnoth and hakon and for someof the principal norman barons while the rest mingled with thesaxon thanes in the body of the hall</s>  as soon as the reception wasover wulf hurried out into the courtyard to speak to osgod</s> right glad am i to see you again osgod i have been troubled asto how you were faring</s> in truth we have fared badly enough master we have been workinglike beasts of burden without having food that would suffice foran ass</s>  however it was not for long and will do us no harm thoughthere are more than one of those fellows at st</s>  valery with whom iwould gladly have ten minutes play with cudgel or quarterstaff</s> you may guess how surprised we were yesterday evening when we weresuddenly called out from the shed where we were sleeping and withmany professions of regret and apology for our treatment conductedto better quarters where a good honest meal was set before us andwe were then told that the duke himself had just arrived at eu andthat harold and all his following were there to be given up to him</s> we had fresh rushes for our beds and a hearty breakfast thismorning and were then placed in boats and taken up to abbeville</s> we had been there but an hour when the earl arrived with the thanesand glad were we as you may imagine to see his face again</s>  theystopped there for an hour to rest their steeds and to dine andthen we marched hither as you saw</s>  i had missed you and beorn fromharolds party and made shift to approach the earl and humbly askhim what had become of you</s>  no harm has befallen your master andhis friend good fellow the earl said</s>  they have indeed done megood service for they made their escape from beaurain and carriedthe news of our detention to duke william and it is thus that wehave all obtained our liberty</s>  you seem to have fared bravelywulf judging from your attire</s> yes we were in sore plight when we arrived at rouen but the dukesaw that we were provided with clothes and with horses for ourjourney here</s> at this moment an attendant came out from the hall and informedwulf that the duke desired speech with him</s>  beorn was already atthe entrance and they were conducted on to the dais</s> here are your two pages the duke said to harold</s>  i hold myselfto be greatly their debtor for having carried me the news that hasbrought about this meeting and given me the pleasure of having youas my guest</s>  they are faithful lads and quickwitted for no mencould have carried out the mission better or more promptly thanthey did</s> still more am i indebted to them harold said as he held out hishand to the two lads who bent on one knee while they kissed it</s> i knew not of their going until i learnt from your barons thatthey had reached rouen with the news</s>  they are wards of mine andalthough at one time my pages they have ceased to be so for morethan a year and have both been down upon their estates learningthe duties of their station which i deemed better for them thanwasting their time and getting into mischief at court</s> the duke nodded</s>  the result shows that your course was a wise one</s> at court youths learn but little good</s>  the atmosphere is not healthyfor men still less for boys and these youths will shortly be ofan age when they will be fit to render mens service as indeedthey have already done</s>  the lads now retired from the dais</s> it has been a fortunate weeks work for us beorn said</s>  we haveobtained the freedom of our lord and have gained his approbationand that of duke william though indeed it matters not greatlyas to the duke</s> i dont know beorn one cannot look into the future and thereis no saying what may happen</s>  anyhow even now it may be of advantageto us</s>  honourably as the duke is treating harold the earl is stillwholly in his power and until we hear something of his intentionswe are all just as much prisoners as we were to conrad although iadmit the captivity is a very much more pleasant one</s> chapter vii</s> the oath</s> from eu the party travelled back to rouen where there were feastingsand entertainments in honour of harold</s>  nothing could be morecourteous than the dukes manner to his guest</s>  he professed analmost fraternal affection for him and handsome lodgings wereassigned in the town to his thanes</s>  a solemn court was held atwhich harold was knighted by william himself with much state andceremonial according to the rites of chivalry which had then beenbut recently introduced and had not as yet extended into england</s> there were great hunting parties in the forest and to all outwardappearance the friendship between william and harold was of thewarmest and most sincere nature</s>  harold himself was really gratifiedat the pains that william took to show the esteem in which he heldhim and his thanes were all well satisfied with the attentionsbestowed upon them by the norman barons</s> beorn and wulf had nothing to do save to make friends with youngnormans of their own age to visit their castles and to join in thehunting parties</s>  the duke lost no opportunity of showing the sincerityof the feelings of gratitude he had expressed to them for bringinghim the news of harolds presence in his dominions and they werealways specially invited to all court ceremonials enjoying themselvesexceedingly</s>  wulf occasionally expressed his surprise to hiscompanion that no word was said as to their return to england butbeorns answer always silenced him</s> the earl himself seems well satisfied wulf</s>  why should you bemore anxious for him than he is for himself</s> once indeed he replied harold is of so open and generous naturebeorn that he would be the last person to suspect another ofdishonourable motives</s>  moreover it is not because he is apparentlywell content here that we must judge him to be without uneasiness</s> whatever he felt it would be impolitic to show it and we see butlittle of him now save when in company of the normans</s>  he cannotbut know that his presence is required in england</s> it was a matter of satisfaction to wulf that walter fitzurse wasnot at the court he having a few weeks before returned to englandwhere he was again in the suite of the norman bishop of london</s>  hehimself had become firm friends with guy de burg and often rodeover with him to his fathers residence where they hunted in theforest together or rode out with falcons on their wrists agnes deburg often accompanying them on her pony</s> three weeks after their arrival at rouen the bretons broke out ininsurrection and the duke invited harold to accompany him on anexpedition to subdue them courteously saying that he should obtaingreat advantage from the military experience of his guest</s> harold accepted the invitation and with his thanes set out withthe duke</s>  against the disciplined forces of normandy the bretonpeasants had no chance whatever in the open field but their wildand broken country wellnigh covered with forest afforded theman opportunity for the display of their own method of fighting bysudden surprises and attacks and they defended their rough butformidable intrenchments with desperate valour</s>  harolds experiencegained in his warfare with the welsh was of much utility and theduke committed to his hands the formal command of the troops engagedaverring that he himself knew comparatively little of warfare suchas this</s> harold conducted the operations with equal vigour and prudence</s> stronghold after stronghold was attacked and captured a smallportion of the force only being engaged in active operations whilstthe rest were posted so as to repel the attempts of the bretons toaid the besieged</s>  by his advice clemency was always shown tothe garrisons when the fortresses were stormed and they werepermitted to return unharmed to their people bearing the news thatthe duke bore no illwill towards them and was ready to show mercyto all who laid down their arms</s>  wulf and beorn were permitted toshare in the assaults and with the saxon thanes followed haroldas he led the way on foot up to the intrenchments at one pointwhile the duke with a party of his barons attacked at another</s>  morethan once the english banner was carried into the heart of thebreton fortress before the normans had fought their way in and oneach of these occasions the duke warmly expressed his admirationfor the courage of his english allies</s>  at last there remained butone formidable stronghold to be captured and so strong was thisby nature and so desperately defended that for some time theefforts of the besiegers were fruitless</s> one evening guy de burg had been with wulf in his tent</s>  beorn wasout spending the evening with some of his norman friends</s>  when guyrose to go wulf said that he would walk with him to his fatherstent which was situated some little distance away</s>  as there hadbeen strict regulations that none were to move about without armshe buckled on his sword and put on his helmet before starting</s> osgod who was lying outside the tent rose when they issued outand followed them at a short distance</s>  they went along at the rearof the tents when wulf suddenly saidit seems to me that i hear sounds in the forest guy</s> de launeys men are posted behind us guy said carelessly thereis no fear of an attack</s> not if they are vigilant wulf agreed</s>  but the bretons have forsome time abstained from night surprises and de launeys men maybe keeping a poor watch</s> suddenly there was a loud cry followed immediately by the bretonwarshout and by a confusion of shouts cries and the sound ofthe clashing of arms</s> the lads drew their swords and ran towards the scene of conflictwhen from some bushes a short distance from them a number of wildfigures sprung out</s>  it was a party of the enemy who had made theirway through de launeys sleeping men unobserved and who now knowingthat further concealment was useless were rushing forward towardsthe tents</s>  wulfs first impulse was to turn back but young deburg shouting his fathers battlecry ran forward and withouthesitation wulf followed him</s>  a moment later they were engaged withthe bretons</s> back to back guy</s>  wulf exclaimed as he ran his sword throughthe first man who attacked him</s> he had scarcely spoken when osgod ran up and joined them andwielding the heavy axe he carried as if it had been a featherweightstruck down several of the bretons who ventured within its swing</s> wulf defended himself as firmly but had to shift his groundcontinually to avoid the blows of the heavy spiked clubs with whichhis assailants were armed</s>  presently he heard his name shouted andan instant later a crash as guy de burg was struck down</s> stand over him osgod</s>  he shouted and with a bound was besidehis companion cutting down a breton who was about to thrust hisspear into him</s>  at the same moment a club descended on his helmetbringing him for a moment to his knee</s>  he sprang up again osgodstriking his opponent to the ground before he could repeat his blow</s> for two or three minutes the fight went on</s>  wulf received more thanone stab from the breton knives as two or three of them oftenrushed in upon him at once but each time when he was hard pressedosgods axe freed him from his assailants for so terrible were theblows dealt by the tall saxon that the bretons shrank from assailinghim and thus left him free at times to render assistance to wulf</s> but the combat was too unequal to last long</s>  a pikethrust disabledwulf for a moment and as his arm fell a blow from a club stretchedhim beside guy</s>  osgod had also received several wounds but furiousat his masters fall he still defended himself with such vigourthat the bretons again fell back</s>  they were on the point of attackinghim anew when there was a shout and william and harold bareheadedas they had leapt from the table and followed by a score or twoof norman barons and soldiers fell upon the bretons</s>  the latterwith cries of alarm at once fled</s> by this time the norman trumpets were everywhere sounding and thetroops hastening out to repel the attack which a few minutes laterceased as suddenly as it began the bretons flying into the forestwhere pursuit by the heavilyarmed normans was hopeless</s>  returningto the tents the duke and harold paused where osgod who had sunkto the ground as soon as the breton attack had ceased was sittingby the side of his master</s> whom have we here</s>  the duke asked</s>  whoever they are we owe oursafety to them harold for had it not been

tents with lights</s> methinks it is one of my men harold said and repeated the dukesquestion in saxon</s> i am osgod my lord the servant of wulf of steyning who with hisfriend guy de burg lies here

will carry wulf to his tent myself harold said raising thelad and carrying him off while four soldiers followed bearingosgod</s>  they were laid down together in wulfs tent</s>  as the youngthanes

anxious to have you with him and theleech said that if you keep quiet today and none of your woundsbreak out afresh it will do you no harm to be carried to my tent</s> accordingly the next day wulf was carried across to lord de burgsand his pallet set down by the side of guys</s>  the latter was alittle better and the leech had faint hopes of his recovery</s>  hisright arm had been broken by a blow with a club and so badlyfractured that it had already been taken off near the shoulder</s>  hismost dangerous wound was a pikethrust on the left side which hadpenetrated his lungs</s>  he smiled faintly as wulf was placed by hisside</s>  wulf tried to smile back again but he was too much shockedat the change in his friends appearance</s>  his cheeks had fallenin and his face was deadly

still pale and feeble but was able to walk andassured his young lord that he should soon be ready for anotherfight with the bretons</s> there will be no more fighting harold said</s>  yesterday

mending very slowly</s>  even yet the leech could not say withcertainty that his life would be saved and warned his father thatin any case he would for a very long time be an invalid</s>  in anotherweek the camp was broken up</s>  wulf declared that he was well enoughto sit a horse but the leech insisted that he should be carriedon a litter</s> in another fortnight he said you may be able to ride but itwould not be safe to attempt to do so now</s>  you are going on as wellas could be wished and it would be madness to risk everything byhaste</s> accordingly he and guy were transported

sent overto say that his presence was looked for at court as soon as he wassufficiently recovered to attend there but he stayed on until hefelt so thoroughly strong and well that he could not make his

will</s> are we likely to go back to england soon my lord</s> i trust it will not be long</s>  i have spoken of it more than onceto the duke but he chides me for being weary of his company whichindeed i am not for no man could have treated another better thanhe has done me</s>  still he said walking up and down the room iam impatient to be off but i am no more free to choose my timehere that i was at beaurain</s>  it is a velvet glove that is placedon my shoulder but there is an iron hand in it i know right well</s> is there no possibility of escaping my lord</s> harold looked keenly at the boy</s>  no wulf treated as i am as aguest i cannot fly without incurring the reproach of the basestingratitude nor even if i wished it could i escape</s>  under theexcuse of doing me honour there are norman soldiers at the gateand a norman sentry stands at my door</s>  i must go through with itnow and if need be promise all that william asks</s>  this time thereis nowhere to send you to fetch aid for me</s>  you have heard isuppose that william has promised me his daughter in marriage</s> yes my lord i have heard it</s>  is the marriage to take place soon</s> harold smiled</s>  the duke will not wish it to take place until hesees that he can secure my services by the marriage</s>  if that timeshould never come i shall probably hear no more of it</s>  engagementshave been broken off before now many a time and absolution for abroken promise of that kind is not hard to obtain</s>  you must attendthe court this evening wulf</s> wulf bowed and withdrew and in the evening attended the court inthe suite of harold</s>  as soon as the dukes eye fell upon him hecalled him up</s> messieurs he said to the barons present this lad is wulf thaneof steyning and a follower of earl harold</s>  he it was who with theyoung guy de burg and aided only by a saxon manatarms withstoodthe first rush of the bretons and so gained time by which i myselfand my barons were able to prepare ourselves to resist the attack</s> had it not been for them we should all have been taken by surpriseand maybe slain</s>  the saxon and the two lads wulf and de burg allfell wounded wellnigh to death but not before twentyone bretonslay dead around them</s>  this was indeed a feat of arms that any ofyou valiant knights and barons as you are might have been proudto perform</s> already i had promised him any boon that in reason he may ask forhaving borne to me the news that earl harold my honoured guest andbrotherinarms had been cast on our shores and i promise himnow that should at any time it happen that i have any power orinfluence in england his estates shall remain to him and to hisheirs free from all service or dues even though he has withstoodme in armsnay more that they shall be largely added to</s>  shouldsuch issue never arise and aught occur to render him desirous ofcrossing the seas hither i promise him a barons feu as a tokenof my gratitude for the great service he rendered me and i am wellassured that whether to a king of england or to a duke of normandyhe will prove himself a true and faithful follower</s>  i call on youall here to witness this promise that i have made and should therebe need to recall it to my memory</s> the normans above all things admired valour and when wulf afterkneeling and kissing the dukes hand retired shamefacedly to acorner of the room where he was joined by beorn one after anothercame up to him and said a few words of approbation</s> you have done well young sir fitzosberne one of the dukesmost trusted councillors said to him</s>  the duke is not given tooverpraise and assuredly no one of your age has ever won suchcommendation from his lips</s>  after making so fair a commencementit will be your own fault indeed if you do not make a great namefor yourself in the future</s>  there is not one of us who was in thedukes camp that evening but feels that he owes you much for thefew minutes delay that saved us from being taken altogether bysurprise</s>  you are young and may think but little of the promise theduke has given you this evening but the day may come when you will findit stand you in good stead</s> harold said nearly the same thing to wulf when he saw him the next morning</s> but there is no chance of the duke ever having power in england my lordwulf said</s> i trust not wulf but there is no doubt that his whole mind is bent uponobtaining the throne of england</s>  he has spoken to me openly about it andhas more than hinted to me that i if married to his daughter would stillas earl of wessex be the foremost man in the land next to its sovereignshould he ever gain the kingdom</s> and what said you my lord if i may be so bold as to ask</s> i said but little lad</s>  i am a prisoner and i am well assured that ishall never return to england until william thinks that he can depend uponme</s>  it is needful that i should return and that quickly for i hear thatthere is fresh trouble in wales and i have received an urgent message fromthe king to hasten to his side</s>  it is hard to see what it is best to do</s> four days later a grand ceremony was announced to take place but few knewwhat its nature was to be</s>  that it was something beyond the ordinary wascertain by the number of barons and knights that were bidden to attend</s>  adais was erected in the courtyard of the palace and on this a tablecovered with a cloth was placed</s> i dont like this business wulf said to beorn as with the other saxonsthey took their place near the dais</s>  there is something very mysteriousabout it and i believe that at last we are going to see what williamsfull intentions are</s> a religious ceremony was first held and then the duke rose to his feet andaddressed the barons</s>  he first recalled to them the promise that edward ofengland had made to him and then went on the saints have worked in myfavour he said by sending here as my guest my wellbelovedbrotherinarms the great earl of wessex</s>  between us there is the closestfriendship and to cement and make even closer the bonds between us he hasbecome betrothed to my daughter and through the lands i shall bestow uponher he will become a baron of normandy</s>  relying upon his affection andfriendship i have called you here together to hear him swear in publicthat which he has already told me privatelythat he will be my faithfulfeudatory and will in all ways aid me to gain my lawful rights</s> harold changed colour</s>  the matter had come upon him as a surprise</s> doubtless he had in a vague way when discussing his future relations assoninlaw to the duke expressed his warm friendship and a generalwillingness to be of service to him but to be called upon to take an oathpublicly was a different matter</s>  most of those present had taken oaths ofallegiance to william and had broken them again and again and williamhimself had not less frequently broken his feudal oaths to his suzerainthe king of france</s>  but harold was a man with a deep sense of religion anddid not esteem as lightly as these norman barons an oath thus sworn but hefelt that he had fallen into a trap and that resistance would but consignhim to a prison if not a grave</s> he at once understood how hollow had been the pretended friendship of hishost but he was in williams power and unless as a friend the duke wouldnever permit so formidable a rival to quit his shores</s>  as he hesitated hesaw a movement on the part of the norman knights near the dais andunderstood that they had been previously informed of williams intentionsand were there to enforce them</s>  their brows were bent on him angrily as hehesitated and more than one hand went to the hilt of the wearers sword</s> there was no drawing back and placing his hand on the table he swore theoath william had dictated</s>  when he concluded william snatched the clothfrom the table and below it were seen a number of bones and sacred relicsthat had been brought from the cathedral</s> enlightened as harold was he was not altogether free from thesuperstitions of the age</s>  for a moment he shuddered slightly and grew palerthan before then he drew himself up to his full height and looked calmlyinto the exulting face of william</s> i call you all to witness the duke said in a loud voice that haroldearl of wessex has taken a solemn oath upon the holy relics to be myfaithful feudatory</s> the shout that answered him was by no means universal for there were manyamong the norman nobles who were shocked at the base trick that the dukehad played upon a guest for whom he had professed the warmest friendship</s> the saxon thanes could scarce contain their expressions of indignation butharold as he sat down among them made a gesture commanding silence</s> we sail for england tomorrow night he said in low tones</s>  the duke toldme so as we came hither</s>  the two ships will be in readiness for us toembark in the morning</s>  i did not understand then the price i was to pay</s> restrain yourselves now when we are free men we can talk this over</s> an hour later they returned to the palace where there was a brief andformal interview between harold and the duke</s>  both dissembled their realfeelings</s>  the duke said that he regretted that the king of englands wishesforced his guest to start so suddenly and that he much regretted hisdeparture</s>  harold thanked him for the hospitality he had shown him butneither made any allusion whatever to the scene that had taken place in thecourtyard</s>  wulf rode over to say goodbye to guy and his father</s>  the latterwas walking up and down the hall with a gloomy face</s> i blush for what has taken place today wulf he said</s>  tell the earlthat had we known what was going to occur there are few indeed who wouldhave attended at the ceremony and that i for one shall hold him in no waydishonoured if he breaks the vow that has thus been dishonourably extortedfrom him</s>  it was a trick and a base one and i would tell duke william soto his face</s>  what will men think of norman faith when guests are thustricked to their disadvantage</s> for an hour wulf remained talking with the baron and his family</s> i hope to see you again wulf de burg said as the lad rose to takeleave</s>  guy regards you as a brother and though assuredly no saxon willset foot on norman soil after todays doings we may yet meet again</s> i shall come over to england to see you wulf if you come not here guysaid</s>  i begin to think that i shall get over this although i may never bereally strong again</s>  we shall often think and talk of you agnes and i andi should like of all things to come and stay in your saxon home</s> no one would be so welcome guy</s>  if we are never to be brothersinarms aswe once talked of we shall surely be brothers in heart whether absent orpresent</s> a few more words and wulf took leave of them all and rode back to rouen</s>  inthe morning the duke accompanied harold to the river bank and there took acourteous farewell of him</s>  it is not probable that he thought for a momentthat harold would observe the oath but he saw that its breach would bealmost as useful to him as its fulfilment for it would enable him todenounce his rival as a perjured and faithless man and to represent anyexpedition against england as being a sort of crusade to punish one who hadbroken the most solemn vows made on the holy relics</s>  harold himselfpreserved his usual calmness of demeanour and stood talking quietly to theduke while the latters presents of hawks and hounds were taken on boardthe ship and the saxons silent and sullen had passed over the gangway</s> then an apparently affectionate embrace was exchanged between the tworivals</s>  harold crossed on to the ship the great sails were hoisted andthe two vessels proceeded down the river</s> chapter viii</s> trouble with wales</s> harold took his place on the poop as the vessel started and remainedlooking fixedly at the duke until the latter with the group of baronsturned and entered the town</s> farewell william of normandy he said false friend and dishonouredhost</s>  how shall we meet next time i wonder and where</s> hitherto the presence of the norman attendants had prevented any privateconverse between harold and his followers but having the poop tothemselves they now broke out into angry exclamations against the duke</s> it was an unworthy and unknightly trick harold said calmly but let usnot talk of it now it will be for the english people to decide thequestion some day and for english bishops to determine whether i am boundby a vow thus extorted</s>  better at all events that i should be held for alltime to have been false and perjured than that the english people shouldfall under the norman yoke</s>  but maybe there will be no occasion for theoath ever to come in question william of normandy or i may die before theking and then there will be an end of it</s>  let us talk of other things</s> thank god we are free men again and our faces are set towards englandwhere from what i hear we may have to meet open foes instead of falsefriends and may have to teach the welsh once and for all that they andtheir king cannot with impunity continually rise in rebellion againstengland</s> well wulf you are the only one among us who has brought back aught fromnormandy at least you and beorn for you have your horses and chains andthe promise of the duke to grant you a boon</s>  but these are small things</s> you have gained great credit and have shown yourself a gallant fighterand have further promises from the duke</s> i care not for his promises wulf said hotly</s>  i hold him to be adishonoured noble and i would take naught from his hands</s> you are young yet wulf harold smiled and the dukes promise madebefore his nobles will be held binding by him if ever the time should comefor you to claim it</s>  do not refuse benefits lad because you do not likethe hands that grant them</s>  you rendered him a service and need feel noshame at receiving the reward for it</s>  as soon as we return i shall takesteps to raise you and beorn to the full dignity of thanes with all rightsand privileges</s>  my brother and my friends here can all testify to theservice you rendered to us for much as i may have to complain of theending of my visit it has at least been vastly better than our lot wouldhave been had we remained in the hands of conrad of ponthieu</s>  you are bothvery young to be placed in the position of rulers of your people and inordinary cases you would not have been sworn to thanes services for someyears to come but as earl of wessex i see good reason for departing fromthe rule on this occasion and i think that my thanes here will all be ofthat opinion</s>  there was a warm expression of approval from the saxons</s> then as soon as we set foot on english soil we will hold a court andinvest you with your full rank</s> they started from the mouth of the seine and as there was no nearer portthan that from which they had sailed harold directed the masters of theships to make for bosham</s> it is like to be a fairer voyage than the last he said as with a lightbreeze blowing behind them they sailed out from the mouth of the seine</s>  itwill be longer but assuredly more pleasant</s> no incident whatever marked the voyage</s>  the saxons gave a shout of joy whenthey first made out the outline of the hills of the isle of wight sometwelve hours after leaving the mouth of the river but it was not untileight hours afterwards that they entered the harbour of bosham</s>  as soon asthe two norman vessels were seen sailing up the quiet sheet of watereverywhere fringed with forest boats put out to meet them to ascertainthe reason of their coming and to inquire for news of harold and hiscompanions</s>  as soon as his figure was made out standing on the poop one ofthe boats rowed off with the news and by the time the vessels droppedanchor off bosham the whole of the inhabitants had gathered on the shorewith loud shouts of joy and welcome</s> as soon as they landed harold and his companions proceeded at once to thechurch where a solemn service of thanksgiving was held for theirpreservation from the dangers of the sea and for their safe return toengland</s>  as soon as the service was over harold sent off two horsemen tobear to the king the news of his return and to state that he himself wouldride to london on the following day</s>  then the earl bestowed handsomepresents upon the masters and crews of the ships that had brought themover and gave into their charge hawks and hounds rich armour and otherpresents for the duke of normandy and jewelled cups and other gifts to theprincipal barons of his court</s> the gifts were indeed of royal magnificence but harolds wealth was vastand as he said to his brother we will at least show these normans thatin point of generosity an english earl is not to be outdone by a normanduke</s>  as soon as these matters were attended to harold held a court in thegreat hall of bosham and there received the oaths of fealty from wulf andbeorn and confirmed to them the possessions held by their fathers andinvested them with the gold chains worn by thanes as the sign of theirrank</s>  he afterwards bestowed a purse of gold upon osgod equal in value tothe one he had received from the duke of normandy</s> should aught ever happen to your master he said come you to me and youshall be one of my own men and shall not lack advancement in my service</s> in faith master wulf osgod said after the ceremony my father warnedme that the trade of a soldier was but a poor one and that a goodhandicraftsman could gain far more money</s>
 he will open his eyes when ijingle these purses before him for i might have hammered armour for yearsbefore i gained as much as i have done in the three months since i leftengland</s>  i have enough to buy a farm and settle down did it so please meand i have clothes enough to last me wellnigh a lifetime and rings enoughto set up a goldsmiths shop</s>  for scarce one of the dukes barons andknights but followed his example and gave me a present for my share inthat little fight with the bretons</s> as for the clothes they will always be useful osgod but were i you iwould get a stout leathern bag and put the purses and rings into it andbury them in some place known only to yourself and where none are everlikely to light upon them</s>  you have no occasion for money now and we mayhope that ere long all occasion for fighting will be over and then as yousay you can buy a farm and marry</s> i am going always to remain your man osgod said in an aggrieved tone</s> certainly osgod i should wish for nothing else</s>  you will always be myfriend and shall have any post on the estates or in the house that you mayprefer</s>  there will be no occasion for you to farm your land yourself youcan let it receiving the value of half the produce and so taking rank asa landowner for which you yourself may care nothing but which will enableyour wife to hold her head higher</s> i am not thinking of wives my lord</s> nonsense osgod i want not to be called my lord</s> but you are a thane now and must be called so osgod said sternly andit would be illbecoming indeed if i your man did not so address you</s>  but iwill take your advice about the gold and when i get down to steyning willbury it deeply under the roots of a tree</s>  it will be safer there than if iburied it in my fathers forge for london is ever the centre of troublesand might be sacked and burnt down should there ever be war between merciaor northumbria and wessex</s> heaven forbid that we should have more civil wars osgod</s> amen to that but there is never any saying</s>  assuredly edwin and morcarlove not our earl and as to tostig though he is his brother he ishotheaded and passionate enough to play any part</s>  and then there are thenormans and there is no doubt the duke will have to be reckoned with</s> altogether methinks my money will be safer under an oaktree down atsteyning than at westminster</s> you are right enough there osgod by all means carry out your ideas</s>  butthere is the bell for supper and i must go</s> the next morning the party started at daybreak and late that night arrivedat westminster</s>  there were great rejoicings in london and throughout thesouth of england when it was known that the great earl had returned fromnormandy</s>  much uneasiness had been felt at his long absence and althoughaccounts had come from time to time of the honour with which he had beentreated by duke william many felt that his prolonged stay was an enforcedone and that he was a prisoner rather than a guest of the duke</s> the king himself was as rejoiced as his subjects at harolds return</s> although in the early years of his reign he had been bitterly opposed tothe powerful family of earl godwin to whom he owed his throne he had oflate years learnt to appreciate the wisdom of harold and although stillnorman in his tastes as in his language he had become much more english atheart and bitterly regretted the promise that he had years before rashlygiven to the duke of normandy</s> harold too had relieved him of all the cares of government which he hatedand had enabled him to give his whole time and thought to religiousexercises and to the rearing of the splendid abbey which was his chiefpleasure and pride</s>  in his absence edward had been obliged to attend tostate business</s>  he was worried with the jealousies and demands of the earlof mercia with the constant complaints of the northumbrians against theirharsh and imperious master tostig and by the fact that the welsh weretaking advantage of the absence of harold to cause fresh troubles</s>  it wasjust christmas when harold returned and the snow fell heavily on the nightof his arrival at westminster</s> it was lucky it did not come a few hours earlier beorn wulf said as helooked out of the casement</s>  we had a long and heavy ride yesterday and wecould not have done it in one day had the snow been on the ground</s>  isuppose there will be a number of court festivities over harolds return</s> we have had enough of that sort of thing in normandy and i hope thatharold will let us return at once to our estates</s> speak for yourself wulf for myself i love the court and now that i am athane i shall enjoy it all the more</s> and i all the less wulf said</s>  fifteen months ago we were but pages andcould at least have some fun now we shall have to bear ourselves as menand the ladies of the court will be laughing at us and calling us thelittle thanes and there will be no getting away and going round to thesmithy to watch osgods father and men forging weapons</s>  it will be all verystupid</s> in a short time an attendant summoned them to breakfast and here they satdown with the other thanes harolds wing of the palace being distinct fromthat of the king</s>  the earl sat at the head of the table and talked inundertones to his brother gurth and two or three of his principal thanes</s> the personal retainers of the nobles stood behind their seats and servedthem with food while harolds pages waited on him and those sitting nextto him</s> we were a merrier party in the pages room beorn whispered to wulf forbut few words were spoken as the meal went on</s> i think there is something in the air wulf said the earl looks moreserious than usual</s>  generally the meals are cheerful enough</s> as soon as it was finished harold said the king will receive you all inhalf an hour he desires to express to you his pleasure at your returnhome</s>  after that i beg that you will again gather here as i have occasionto speak to you</s> the court was a more formal one than usual the kings norman functionarieswere all present as were several ecclesiastics</s>  among them the bishop oflondon behind whom stood wulfs old adversary walter fitzurse</s>  earlharold introduced his companions in captivity the king receiving them verygraciously</s> i am glad to see that you have all returned safely he said</s>  the earltells me that you have all borne yourselves well in the battles you havefought under the banner of my friend and ally duke william of normandy andthat you have proved to his countrymen that the english are in no whitinferior to themselves in courage</s>  the earl specially recommended to me hisnewlymade thanes wulf of steyning and beorn of fareham who did him thegreatest service by effecting their escape from the castle of beaurain andat great risk bearing the news of his imprisonment to duke william</s>  wulfof steyning he tells me gained the highest approval of the duke and hisknights by a deed of bravery when their camp was surprised by the bretons</s> the earl has informed me that in consideration of these services he hasadvanced them to the rank of thanes and confirmed them in their fatherspossessions and as service rendered to him is service rendered to me ithus bestow upon them a token of my approval and beckoning to the youngthanes to advance he took two heavy gold bracelets from his arm andhimself fastened them on those of the kneeling lads</s> when the ceremony was over harolds party returned to the room where theyhad breakfasted</s>  it was an hour before the earl joined them</s> i have been in council with the king he said and have thus been forcedto keep you waiting</s>  we heard when abroad that the welsh were againbecoming troublesome but i find that matters are much worse than i hadsupposed</s>  griffith has broken out into open rebellion he has ravaged allthe borders has entered the diocese of wulfstan the new bishop ofworcester and carried his arms beyond the severn laying waste part of myown earldom of hereford</s>  edwin who has just succeeded his father in theearldom of worcester is young and new to his government and moreoverhis father was an ally of griffiths</s>  in any case he needs far largerforces than those at his command to undertake a war with the welsh</s>  thistime we must finish with them treaties are of no avail they are everbroken on the first opportunity and a blow must be dealt that will renderthem powerless for harm for generations to come</s> therefore the king has commissioned me forthwith to act in the matter notonly as lord of hereford but as earl of the west saxons</s>  winter is upon usand it will be impossible to undertake a regular campaign</s>  still a blowmust be struck and that quickly and heavily in order to stop thedepredation and ruin they are spreading in the west counties</s>  thepreparations must be secret and the blow sudden</s>  there is no time forcalling out levies that must be done in the spring</s>  i must act only withmounted men</s>  i have already sent off a messenger to bosham to bid myhousecarls mount and ride to salisbury</s>  they will number two hundred</s>  ipray you all to leave at once for your estates or to send an order by aswift messenger for your housecarls to ride to salisbury whither i myselfshall proceed in three days</s>  will each of you give me the tale of thenumber of armed men who can take horse at an hours notice</s> each of those present gave the number of housecarls in his service andthey all expressed their willingness to ride themselves in order to getthem ready the more speedily</s>  the total mounted to three hundred and fiftymen</s> that with my own two hundred will be wellnigh sufficient harold saidbut i will send off messengers at once to some of the thanes of dorset andsomerset to join us at gloucester with their men so that we shall be fullya thousand strong which will be ample for my purpose</s>  i need not impressupon you all to preserve an absolute silence as to the object for which youare calling out your men</s>  news spreads fast and an incautious word mightruin our enterprise</s>  there is no occasion for you all to accompany yourmen</s>  those of you who have been with me in normandy will doubtless desireto stay for a while with your wives and families and you may do equallygood service by making preparations there for a more serious campaign inthe spring</s>  i beg these to send with their housecarls a trusted officerand bid him place himself and his men under my orders</s> the meeting at once broke up</s> i suppose you young warriors will bring your own men to salisbury</s>  haroldsaid as wulf and beorn came up to take their leave of him</s> certainly my lord beorn said</s>  we have neither family nor relations tokeep us at home and even if we had it would not suffice to keep us fromfollowing your banner</s> it will be a warfare like that in which you have been engaged across thesea harold said</s>  the bretons you there fought with are kinsfolk of thewelsh speaking the same language and being alike in customs and infighting</s>  they trust to surprises and to their speed of foot andknowledge of their wild country rather than to hard fighting in the openplain</s>  they have few towns to capture and it is therefore hard to executereprisals upon them</s>  like the bretons they are brave and fight savagelyuntil the last neither giving nor asking for quarter</s>  they believe thattheir country which is so wild and hilly as to be a great naturalfortress is unconquerable and certainly neither saxon nor dane has eversucceeded in getting any foothold there</s>  but when the spring comes i hopeto teach them that even their wild hills are no defence and that theirhabits of savage plundering must be abandoned or we will exterminate themaltogether</s>  but i have no thought of undertaking such a campaign now</s>  ofcourse you will take that tall follower of yours with you wulf</s> i fear that he would not stay behind even if i ordered him to do so wulflaughed</s>  he will be overjoyed when i tell him there is a prospect offighting again and all the more if it is against kinsmen of the bretonsagainst whom he feels a special grudge</s> the feeling would be more natural the other way harold said smilingseeing that he inflicted upon them far greater damage than he received</s> you will find fresh horses awaiting you</s>  none of those that carried us frombosham yesterday are fit for another such journey today</s> wulf had told osgod the first thing in the morning that he could return tohis family for a few days only coming to the palace to serve his mealsand he now hurried away to the armourers shop where he found that butlittle work was going on the men being absorbed in listening to osgodsaccount of his adventures</s>  ulred and the men rose and saluted respectfullyas wulf entered</s> i am sorry to disturb you ulred he said but i have come to fetchosgod away again</s>  that is if he would prefer riding with me to remainingquiet with you at home</s> if you are going master assuredly i am going with you osgod said</s>  iam dry with talking already and father must wait for the rest of my storyuntil i come back again</s>  are we going down to steyning my lord</s> there first and afterwards elsewhere but that is all i can tell you now</s> the horses are ready and there is not a moment to lose</s>  we must get as faron our way as possible before nightfall for the matter is an urgent one</s> i am ready osgod said girding on his sword and putting his cap on hishead</s>  goodbye father</s>  tell mother i shall be back when i am back andthat is all i can say about it</s> they reached steyning at two oclock on the following afternoon andmessengers were instantly sent round to the farms bidding the men who werebound as housecarls to appear on horseback and armed with two days foodin their wallets an hour before daybreak next morning</s>  then a messengerwas despatched with a letter to the prior of bramber telling him of wulfssafe return and begging him to excuse his coming over to see him as hehad ridden nigh a hundred and fifty miles in three days and was forced toset out again at daybreak the next morning</s>  as wulf had hoped the letterwas answered by the prior in person and to him wulf related that eveningthe incidents of their stay in normandy</s> the prior shook his head</s> i have feared ever since i heard that harold had fallen into the clutchesof the duke that he would never get off scot free but would either haveto pay a heavy ransom or make some concessions that would be even worse forengland</s>  it is a bad business wulf a bad business</s>  the church has everbeen ready to grant absolution from oaths extracted by violence but thisaffair of the relics makes it more serious and you may be sure thatwilliam will make the most of the advantage he has gained</s>  harold isabsolutely powerless to fulfil his oath</s>  neither he nor the king nor anyother man can force a foreign monarch upon free england</s>  and did harolddeclare for the duke of normandy powerful and beloved as he is he wouldbe driven into exile instantly</s>  if he himself is elected king by thepeople as there is no doubt whatever will be the case he must needs obeytheir voice and will have no choice between being king of england or anexile</s>  still it is unfortunate</s>  he will be branded as a perjurer williamsinfluence may even induce the pope to excommunicate him and although theban would go for but little here it would serve as an excuse for the othergreat earls to refuse to submit to his authority</s>  now tell me how is itthat you have to ride again so suddenly when but just arrived</s> i can tell you father though i can tell no one else</s>  harold has orderedus to bring out our housecarls and with them he means to deal a blowagainst the welsh who have been devastating our western counties</s>  theexpedition is to be secret and sudden although against what point and inwhat manner the blow is to be struck harold has kept his own counsel</s> the welsh are ever a thorn in our side the prior said and treatieswith them are useless</s>  i trust that harold will succeed in thoroughlyreducing them to obedience for whenever there is trouble in the kingdomthey take advantage of it and are ready to form alliances with anyambitious earl who hoists the standard of revolt</s>  and so you say harold hasalready made you full thane</s>  i am well pleased to hear it if for no otherreason than that it is good for people when they are ruled over by theirown lord and not by a stranger though i say nothing against egbertharolds steward</s>  still no man can rule like the master himself</s> at the first dawn of day wulf mounted and rode away from the palacefollowed by osgod</s>  he was clad now in the ringed armour a suit of which hehad had made of lighter material than usual</s>  only on the shoulders and overthe chest was the leather of the usual thickness elsewhere it was thin andextremely soft and the rings did not overlap each other as much as usual</s> the weight therefore was much less than that ordinarily worn by thanesalthough it differed but little from it in appearance</s>  the helmet alsowas of stout leather thickly covered with metal rings and the flap felldown over the neck and ears having a bar coming down in front to protectthe nose</s> osgods suit was thicker and heavier and was similar to that of the fortymen who were drawn up in two lines under the soldier whom harold had sentdown to train them</s>  they were a stout set of young fellows well mountedand armed and as they broke into a cry of welcome to our thane wulffelt proud to command such a body</s> thanks my friends he said heartily</s>  i am glad to see that not one ismissing from your number and feel sure that you will do credit to mybanner</s> they rode that day to fareham where they received a hearty welcome frombeorn and starting in the morning with his troop of thirty men reachedsalisbury late that evening</s>  they were met at the entrance to the town byone of harolds officers who conducted them to a large barn where strawhad been thickly strewn for the men to sleep on</s>  the horses were fastenedoutside</s> earl harold arrived an hour since the officer said and bade me tellyou that he is lodged at the reeves where he expects you</s> they found on arriving at the house that many of the

travelling as fast and as far as the horses could carry them the forcereached gloucester</s>  here they received an even warmer welcome than hadgreeted them elsewhere for the citizens had been greatly alarmed at thewelsh forays and as soon as they knew that the great earl himself was withthe troops they had no doubt that he had come to give them protection andto punish their enemies</s>  the contingents from somerset and dorset hadalready arrived and without the delay of a single day the troops againstarted</s> the housecarls although mounted were not trained to fight on horseback</s> their steeds were valuable only as enabling them to move with greatercelerity across the country than they could do on foot and to bring themfresh and in fighting condition to the scene of action</s>  once there theydismounted and a portion being told off to look after the horses the mainbody advanced on foot against the enemy</s> there was yet a long ride before them</s>  following the severn on its westernside so as to avoid the passage of the avon they rode to worcester andthen up through dudley and shrewsbury</s> it would have been shorter to have passed through hereford and ludlow butharold feared that they might there come upon some marauding party of thewelsh and any of these who escaped might carry the news across the borderwhen the fleetfooted mountaineers would quickly have conveyed it to thewelsh king at his castle at rhuddlaw</s>  rhuddlaw now a small village issituated in denbighshire and was an important military position situatedas it was at no great distance

journeyed the news of their coming was borne more rapidly</s>  griffithreceived the news an hour before their arrival and mounting rode down tothe avon and embarked on board ship</s> great was the disappointment of the earl and his followers when they foundthat the object of their long march across england had failed and that thecapture of the welsh king which would have put an end to the trouble hadbeen missed so narrowly</s>  the castle was at once set on fire the welshships on the avon were also given to the flames and the very same dayharold led his troops away and by easy marches took them back togloucester</s>  here they halted</s>  the housecarls from the south who had neverbeen in contact with the welsh were inclined to murmur among themselves athaving been led back without striking a blow but the contingents from thewestern counties who had had experience of this wild warfare told themthat they might consider themselves fortunate</s> you know not what a war with these savages is an old housecarl who hadfought them again and again said to a listening group of wulfs men</s>  youmight as well fight with the evil spirits of the air as with them</s>  fight</s> there is no fighting in it save when they have with them danes from thenorth or norwegians</s>  with these to bear the brunt of the battle the welshwill fight valiantly in their fashion but alone they know that they cannotwithstand us for a moment</s>  i have been after them a score of times and itis a nightmare</s>  you go up hills and through forests you plunge intomorasses you scramble up precipices you are wet you are hungry you areworn out but never do you catch sight of one of them</s> now and then as you wind along the face of a hill rocks will comethundering down in the woods and swamps you hear their mocking yells andlaughter</s>  at the end of the day you drop down where you halt and then justas you fall off to sleep there is a wild yell and in a moment they areswarming among you slashing and ripping with their long knives crawlingon the ground and springing upon you getting among the horses andhamstringing or cutting them open</s>  by the time those of you that are alivehave got together they have gone and all is so quiet that were it not forthe scattered bodies you might believe that it was all a dream</s>  two orthree times before morning the attack will be repeated until you areforced to keep under arms in military array</s>  as soon as it is light yourecommence your march and so it goes on day after day until at lastwornout and spent and less in strength by half than when you started yougather under the shelter of the walls of one of the border towns</s> i should have been glad indeed if we had caught their king for if he hadbeen held hostage in london we might have had peace but well content am ithat harold has abstained from entering upon a campaign which terrible asit is even in summer would be beyond endurance of the strongest inwinter</s> well for my part osgod who was one of the listeners remarked iwould rather go on by myself and take the chance of getting a good blow atsome of these wild men than ride all the way back to steyning to be laughedat by the women there as brave soldiers who have marched across englandand back and never unsheathed their swords</s>  nor will i believe that earlharold can intend so to make a laughingstock of us</s>  the bretons were justas active as are these welshmen but he brought them to reason there and iwarrant me he will do the same here</s>  at any rate he seems in no hurry tomove</s>  we have been here nigh a week already and why should he keep us hereif we are not to be employed</s> it was not very long before it became known that harold had no intention ofmarching away and leaving the welsh unpunished and that in the spring acampaign on a great scale was to be undertaken against them</s>  the thanes ofall the western counties were ordered to hold themselves in readiness tojoin with their levies in the spring</s>  the somerset and devon men were togather at bristol and thence to be conveyed by ships to the southern coastof wales the troops at gloucester were to march west and tostig was tobring down a body of northumbrian horse and to enter wales from chester</s> the housecarls to their surprise were ordered to lay aside their ringedarmour and heavy helmets in place of which leather jerkins and caps wereserved out to them their heavy axes were to be left behind and they wereto trust to the sword alone</s>  they were to abandon the tactics in whichthey had been trained of fighting shoulder to shoulder with shieldoverlapping shield and were to exercise themselves in running andclimbing in skirmishing with an imaginary foe and rapidly gathering inclose formation to resist anticipated attack</s>  harold himself gave themthese instructions</s> you will have no foe to meet breast to breast he said if we are toconquer and to root out these hornets it must be by showing ourselves evenmore active than they are</s>  speed and activity go for everything in a warlike this while our own methods of fighting are absolutely useless</s>  unlesswe make an end of this matter you may be called away from your homes once ayear to repel these attacks while if you conquer now there will be nowelsh foray again during your lifetime</s>  therefore it is worth while to makea great effort and for once to lay aside our own method of fighting</s>  yourcommanders will see that all the exercises are well carried out and willreport to me regarding those who show most zeal and energy</s>  extra pay willbe given to all and i shall know how to reward those who are reported tome as most deserving of it</s> the troops set to work with great energy and soon recognized the advantagethey gained by laying aside their heavy arms and armour</s>  swimming runningand climbing were practised incessantly and when may arrived and with itthe time for the commencement of the campaign all felt confident of theirability to cope with the welsh in their own methods of warfare</s> chapter ix</s> in the welsh valleys</s> wulf and beorn did not form part of the expedition which was to embark withharold from bristol and to enter wales by one of its southern valleys</s>  itwas necessary that the gathering of the levies at gloucester should bestrengthened by having as a nucleus three hundred trained soldiers</s>  thelevies were lightly armed and accustomed to fight in the same irregularmanner as their welsh adversaries whom they held in considerable dreadfor the fierce hillmen had again and again proved themselves more than amatch for the peaceable natives on the english side of the border</s>  theaddition then of three hundred housecarls was required to give themconfidence</s>  these had indeed abandoned for the time their armour heavyweapons and solid formation but they could still were it necessary gatherin a line behind which the levies could rally and which would beimpregnable to the undisciplined attacks of the welsh</s> the young thanes were somewhat disappointed at finding that they were notto accompany the earl but as he told them it was a mark of hisconfidence that he should post them with the force where the fighting waslikely to be more severe and the risk greater than with that he himselfled</s> i shall penetrate into the heart of wales he said</s>  i shall havehorsemen with me a strong force of trained soldiers and the levies andthe enemy will i feel sure be unable to oppose us successfully but it islikely enough that when the welsh find that my force from the south andtostigs from the north cannot be withstood they will pour out on theireastern frontier and try to light such a flame in worcester hereford andgloucester that we should be obliged to abandon our work and hurry backto stem the tide of their invasion</s>  it is necessary therefore that fromthis side also there should be a forward movement</s>  my brother gurth willcommand here</s>  i have strongly recommended you to him</s>  your experience inthe breton war will be of assistance to you and i have told him that youcan be far better trusted than many older than yourselves in carrying outexpeditions among their hills and valleys</s> i do not anticipate there will be any pitched battles the welsh know thatthey cannot withstand our trained soldiers</s>  it will be a war ofskirmishes of detached fighting of surprises long marches and greatfatigues</s>  every valley in the country is to be harried with fire and sword</s> they are to be made to feel that even in their mountains they are not safefrom us and as they never take prisoners nor give quarter in the forays onour side of the border so we will hunt them down like wolves in their ownforests</s>  the work must be done so thoroughly that for a hundred years atleast the lesson will not be forgotten</s> in the last week of may gurth moved forward marching first to hereford asa more central point of attack and then crossing the border and enteringwales</s>  the troops carried no heavy baggage</s>  meat they expected to findflour was carried on two hundred packhorses</s>  the force was about 4000strong</s>  the housecarls marched in a body keeping solid order</s>  behind themcame the pack animals each led separately so that they could the moreeasily make their way through forests or over broken ground</s>  they marchedin lines forty abreast</s>  the lightarmed levies led by their respectivethanes moved as they chose on the flanks of the trained troops or followedin the rear</s> when they halted on the first evening after crossing the frontier theylighted their fires and bivouacked</s>  wulf and beorn walked together throughthe camp</s> in spite of the fact that they are all dressed somewhat alike in leatherjerkins it is easy to see which are the trained soldiers wulf said</s>  thehousecarls are as merry over the food they have brought with them as ifthey were going upon a march of pleasure through the hills while theborder levies evidently regard the business as a serious one</s> that is no wonder beorn replied seeing how for years they havesuffered at the hands of the welsh</s>  look at those hills wulf i can counta dozen beacons alight</s>  of course they have heard of the preparations forattack and they are flashing the news from hill to hill of the advance ofour force</s>  it will not be long before they gather to oppose us</s> it is like enough they may attack us tonight beorn</s>  they may have hadspies at hereford and will have known two days ago of our coming</s>  they mayreckon that we should anticipate no attack until farther among their hillsand that we shall in consequence be careless as in truth we seem to be</s>  ithink it would be well to offer gurth our housecarls to stand sentrytonight</s> he might laugh at us beorn said doubtfully</s> well let him laugh he will laugh goodhumouredly anyhow for he is of akindly and lighthearted disposition</s>  at any rate there cannot be any harmin proposing it and after the surprise we got from the bretons we cannotbe too cautious</s> they walked to the fire where gurth was sitting with four or five of hisfriends all of whom had furnished bodies of housecarls</s>  the border thaneshad by his orders each remained with his own following so that at alltimes they should be in readiness to give orders and lead them in case ofsurprise</s> where have you been young thanes</s>  gurth asked</s>  you slipped away as soonas our meal was finished as if you were afraid of the winecup</s> we care not much for drinking beorn said and have been going throughthe force to see how it was disposed</s>  we have come to offer that our menshall tonight furnish guards for the camp</s> there is no occasion for it gurth said the welshmen will not attack usuntil we are entangled among their hills</s> it depends upon how well they are led my lord gurth wulf said</s>  if theyare well led they may attack us tonight for they must know of ourapproach and will think it probable that we shall being so near our ownborder be at first careless</s>  the bretons gave us just such a lesson andinflicted heavy loss upon the norman army</s> well post your men as you like gurth said though it seems to me thatit would be better for them to husband their strength for tomorrowsmarch</s> they shall have half a nights sleep each wulf said</s> if i had not known how stoutly you fought and how your courage saved thenorman camp i should have said you were overcautious gurth laughed</s> however i will not refuse your offer young thanes though methinks thereis no chance whatever of the welsh disturbing us here</s> having obtained the permission beorn and wulf returned to the fires oftheir men</s> we are to have the honour of furnishing the guards tonight osgod</s>  tellthe men that gurth relies upon our watchfulness</s>  we dont want arepetition of the surprise we had from the bretons</s>  it will be but a shortnights watch</s>  tis nine now and by four it will be broad daylight</s> beorns men and ours will march a hundred yards out from the camp</s>  half canlie down to sleep at once the other half we can post as sentries andrelieve them at halfpast twelve</s>  an attack if it comes will come from thefront therefore we will post the men twenty or thirty yards apart alongthere and for some distance round the flanks</s>  one of us will remain withthe party that lies down so as to be in readiness to lead them at onceagainst any point attacked the other will move round and round to see thatthe sentries are vigilant</s> that is good news to me osgod said</s>  methinks that affair in the bretonwood has shaken my courage for i have been looking at those trees in frontof us and wondering whether the welsh are gathering there and thinkinghow it would be with all these raw levies if they came down upon ustonight it went hard for a bit with the normans tried soldiers thoughthey were but i would not trust these levies to stand for a moment forthey hold the welsh in mighty respect</s> the men cheerfully took their arms and fell in</s>  they considered it acompliment that they had been chosen to furnish the first guard</s>  beornsmen with a portion of wulfs were to furnish the first line of sentries</s> the two young thanes accompanied by osgod went round with them and postedthem after giving them strict injunctions to be watchful and vigilant</s> these savages beorn said will creep up through the grass asnoiselessly as cats so you must keep your ears as well as your eyes wellopen and if you hear but the breaking of a twig challenge at once</s>  thenif they rise shout the alarm at the top of your voice and do the whole ofyou run back to us here if the cry comes from the front if from eitherflank hurry to that spot and we shall do the same from here but becareful not to rouse the camp by a false alarm for if you do instead ofgaining credit we shall become the jest of the whole force</s> when the sentries were placed beorn with the leader of his band began togo the rounds while wulf and osgod returned to their party</s> you can sleep master while i watch beside you osgod said</s>  i could notsleep if i lay down for i have got the yells of those bretons in my earsand could not close an eye</s> very well osgod in that case i may as well take a nap</s> he was soon sound asleep and remained so until osgod touched him</s>  he satup in a moment</s> by the stars it is past midnight my lord and it is time for us torelieve beorns party</s>  the men were at once called to their feet and therelief effected</s> if an attack comes wulf said as with osgod he proceeded to walkbackwards and forwards along the line of sentries i fancy it will be justbefore daybreak</s>  many of them may come from long distances and theirleader would wait until the last moment in order to gather as large a forcetogether as possible</s>  besides men sleep heaviest at that time and theywould reckon that hour as best for a surprise</s>  as they walked theyfrequently paused to listen intently and though once or twice they thoughtthey heard distant sounds these might be caused by the passage of a wildanimal through the bushes</s>  the sentries were all vigilant</s>  it was the firsttime that the sussex lads had been in face of an enemy and the stillnessof the night the sombre forest in front of them and the possibility of asavage and unknown foe lurking there kept them thoroughly on the alert</s> once or twice wulf and osgod went forward to examine some bush that hadseemed to the imagination of a sentry to have moved but in each case thealarm was groundless</s> it must be nearly three oclock now osgod wulf said at last</s>  anotherhalf hour will decide it</s>  i shall be glad when the morning comes for thiswork is trying and i keep on fancying i hear noises</s> i fancy so too osgod said</s>  it seems to me like a sort of whisper orrustling of leaves</s> that is just what it seems to me osgod</s>  let us stay where we are</s>  we arejust in the centre of the line now</s> there are certainly sounds my lord</s>  i thought it was fancy before but iam sure now</s> i hear something wulf said</s>  it comes from the front</s>  run round to theright and bring the sentries from that flank and post them in the intervalsof those in front while i do the same on the left</s> they had but just returned when they heard a sharp sound like the crackingof a stick a short distance in front</s>  a dozen of the sentries at oncechallenged</s>  in an instant a number of figures sprang to their feet at adistance of some fifty yards in front of them</s>  then a wild yell was raisedand swarms of men came rushing towards them while a volley of arrows andjavelins whizzed through the air</s> fall back on the others men</s>  wulf shouted at the top of his voice andthe line of sentries rushed back to beorns party who leapt to their feetat the sound of the welsh warcry</s>  they had scarce formed in line when theenemy were upon them</s>  they received them with a volley of javelins andthen shield to shield they withstood the attack they were fighting in theirown way now and numerous as the welsh were they were unable as they ranup in scattered order to break through the line</s> steady men steady</s>  wulf shouted out from his post in the middle of theline</s>  our friends will soon be up</s>  show a stout front</s>  do not give way afoot</s> in vain the welshmen with wild yells strove to beat back the saxon line</s> their very numbers were a hindrance to them</s>  those in front pressedforward so that those behind were unable to use their javelins or arrows</s> many creeping between the legs of the fighters of the front rank leapt witha catlike spring upon the saxons and strove to rip them with theirknives but the light wickerwork shields covered with leather which hadtaken the place of the solid and heavy ones generally carried by thehousecarls stood wulfs followers in good stead and although many of theshields were penetrated by the knives of the welsh they in most caseseffectually screened the bodies of the soldiers</s> the lightlyarmed welsh on the other hand were hewn down by the longswords of the saxons in the front rank while the javelins of those behindthem flew with terrible effect among their assailants</s>  there was howeverno pause in the fury of the attacks of the welsh until with a greatshout the main body of the saxons came up and pressed forward in linewith the little body who had hitherto borne the brunt of the battle whileon their flank the thanes levies poured in volley after volley of dartsand arrows</s>  the fight ceased as suddenly as it began</s>  the sound of adeeptoned horn rose in the air whereupon the welsh instantly abandonedthe struggle and before the saxons had time to realize that the fightingwas over they had disappeared in the forest</s> by st</s>  peter young thanes</s>  earl gurth exclaimed as he came up to wulfsband who were panting from their exertions you have saved us from agrievous mishap this night</s>  i take shame unto myself that i treated yoursuggestion so lightly for by the saints we should have fared badlyindeed had this wild foe taken us asleep</s>  the thanks of the whole force aredue to you and i will take care that my brother harold knows how narrow anescape we have had and in telling the tale i shall not spare either myselfor the older thanes who were disposed to mock your proposal to keep guardover the camp as showing an amount of caution altogether unnecessary</s>  theattack has been a lesson to me that i shall not forget and henceforth ishall select you and your force for any special service requiringwatchfulness and valour</s> in going among their men wulf and beorn found that but six had fallen forthe most part under the shower of javelins with which the welsh hadheralded their attack</s>  many of the others had received wounds more or lesssevere but few of them were so badly hurt as to render it necessary toleave them behind</s>  gurth called the thanes at once to a council</s>  fresh woodwas thrown on to his fire and some twenty of the thanes took their placesround it</s>  wulf and beorn were specially asked by gurth to attend</s>  theattack of the welsh had shown that they were by no means dismayed at theextent of the preparations for the invasion of their mountains and thatthe advance must be conducted with the greatest caution and prudence</s> it is well gurth said that in the absence of griffith they have manyleaders and will therefore fight without any general plan</s>  did their wholeforce fall upon one or other of our columns it might go very hard with itbut we may be sure that each chief will desire to keep his followers byhim in order to defend his own valleys</s>  nevertheless they have showntonight that they can gather rapidly and in considerable force and weshall have to root them out piecemeal and shall not be able to scatter ourforce too widely</s>  i am told that the valley at whose mouth we now arecontains a large number of villages and to this we must confine ourselvesuntil we have done the work there</s>  i trust that they will oppose usstoutly</s>  in that case we shall have the less trouble with them when wecome to undertake the more difficult task of pursuing them among theirhills</s> the next morning the advance began and they had proceeded but a shortdistance when the welsh again poured down upon them</s>  this time the forcewas prepared for the attack and although the welsh fought obstinatelythey were driven back without much difficulty</s>  as soon as the attack ceasedgurth gave the order for pursuit and the housecarls held their coursestraight up the valley at full speed while the levies swarmed up thehillsides to prevent the welsh from rallying and attacking in flank</s>  thetroops now felt the benefit of the abandonment of their heavy armour andweapons and pressed so hotly upon the flying welsh that they entered thefirst village with them</s>  for a time the natives turned and foughtdesperately in defence of their homes but they were unable to withstandthe skill and discipline of the saxon troops and the measure that they hadso frequently dealt out to the saxon villagers now fell on them</s>  no quarterwas given</s>  every man woman and child was slaughtered and the housesgiven to the flames</s>  village after village was captured and burnt but theresistance became fainter and fainter and the last three villages at thehead of the valley were found to be entirely deserted</s>  then just as thesun set the force bivouacked for the night the horns calling in thescattered levies who gradually rejoined them</s> the next morning the force was broken up into five or six columns eachhaving a proportion of the regular soldiers and a body of the levies</s>  thesepenetrated side valleys and climbed the hills</s>  in many cases theyencountered resistance stones being rolled down upon them and the welshdefending strong barricades of felled trees</s>  but everywhere the saxons weresuccessful and day after day continued the work until at the end of fivedays they were able to move where they would without encountering anyresistance</s>  the force now marched forward from the head of the valleycrossed a range of hills and descended into another valley</s>  they had nowgrown more confident in themselves and while a third of the forceproceeded to lay waste the valley the rest broken up into small columnsascended the hills on either side carrying fire and sword into everyhamlet they came upon</s> several of the fortalices of the welsh chiefs perched on almostinaccessible eminences gave great trouble and were only taken afterserious loss</s>  one day beorn and wulf with their own following and twohundred and fifty lightarmed levies were despatched by gurth to porthwyna stronghold belonging to a powerful chief named llewellyn ap rhys</s> it is from all i hear he said a very strong place and will requireall our force to capture it</s>  indeed it is reported to be so strong that itmay be necessary to leave it unmolested until we form a junction withharold and can besiege it regularly</s>  it would not do to make anunsuccessful attack for that would raise the spirits of the welsh</s>  allthat i wish of you is to obtain a view of the castle from all sides ifpossible to bring me back an exact account of its defences and to give meyour opinion as to our chances of capturing it if we decide to lay siege toit</s> porthwyn was forty miles distant and beorn and wulf determined to marchsome thirty of these and then to push forward at daybreak so as to obtaina view of the fortress in the early morning</s>  they took with them a welshboy as a guide</s>  he had been spared in the last village captured and hadbeen told that his life depended upon his guiding them faithfully</s>  theplaces of ten men who had fallen during the various fights had been filledup by an equal number of gurths own housecarls</s>  the seventy soldiers keptwith their leaders and the guide the levies spreading out on either side</s> two of the irregulars who spoke a little welsh accompanied the young thanesto question the guide if necessary</s>  the march was a heavy one</s>  at timesthey passed through thick forests in the valleys and on the lowerhillsides at times crossed over bare hills on whose summits the groundwas frequently so boggy that the men had to march with the greatestcaution</s>  the guide a sullen lad with matted hair whose only attire was asheepskin was several times questioned sharply as to whether he wascertain of the way</s>  he answered in monosyllables saying that he knew everyfoot of the road and indeed he never hesitated for a moment</s> i suppose he is right wulf said although i thought it lay more to thewest than we are going but we have wound about so among these forests andhills that i am quite confused</s>  there is one comfort beorn if the guideproves treacherous and we lose ourselves altogether we have but to set ourfaces to the rising sun and we shall find ourselves back on the border fori am sure that we could not retrace our steps to gurths camp</s> the sun was just setting when they found themselves on a bare plateau onthe crest of a range of hills higher than any they had before crossed</s> ask him how far we are from porthwyn wulf said to the interpreter</s> he says twelve miles my lord</s> then when we get across this flat which looks full two miles wide wewill camp in the first valley we come to</s> as they advanced the ground became more and more boggy and the troops hadto move carefully stepping from one tussock of coarse grass to anotherthe intervals being filled with black slimy mud</s> ask him if this gets deeper beorn said angrily for if it does so weare like to be all swallowed up</s>  i believe he must be leading us wrong</s> osgod had charge of the boy and was walking close beside him</s>  as thequestion was put by the interpreter the boy muttered that he knew the way</s> the man turned to translate his answer to beorn when there was a suddenshout</s>  at the moment that osgod was making a long step from one tuft toanother the boy stooped and caught his foot and with a roar of surpriseand fury osgod fell headforemost into the morass</s>  at the same moment thelad darted away with a yell of defiance leaping from tuft to tuft with theagility of a hare</s>  several of the men started after him but unaccustomedto the treacherous bog four or five were immersed in it to their waistbefore they had gone a dozen paces</s> shoot</s>  shoot</s>  beorn shouted and a dozen javelins were thrown but theboy was almost beyond distance and his rapid and irregular movementsrendered it wellnigh impossible to take aim with any accuracy</s>  most of thejavelins flew wide of him and he was soon beyond reach</s>  osgod waswellnigh smothered before he could be rescued and some of the other menwere only hauled out with the greatest difficulty</s>  three or four of themost active men were sent forward but presently returned with the newsthat the bog became worse</s> the sun has already set wulf said and if darkness catches us here ourplight will be a bad one</s>  let us retrace our steps at once beorn</s> it was with great difficulty that they made their way back to firm ground</s> by the time they did so darkness had fallen</s> this is a bad business altogether beorn wulf said</s>  in the first placewe have lost our guide in the second place we have no idea where we arefor we may for aught we know have been going in the wrong direction all thetime and besides this the boy will raise the country against us and inthe morning we may be attacked

we have broughtwith us</s>  then i should say we had best march for some hours</s>  it matters notin what direction so that we get as far as possible from here</s> as beorn could suggest nothing better wulfs counsel was carried out</s> supper was cooked and eaten in the forest and after two hours for restfor the march had been a very fatiguing one they started</s>  the night wasmoonless and in the shadow of the trees the darkness was intense</s>  thehousecarls kept together moving as closely as possible to each other</s>  thelevies were ordered to follow them</s> after proceeding for two hours wulf said let us halt and see if we areall together</s>  the housecarls halted but when he went to the rear wulfcould see no signs of the irregulars</s> let no man speak or move he said i want to listen</s> but no sound broke the stillness of the wood</s> how foolish of oswald and edred he said to beorn</s> we told them to follow with their levies close behind us and they musthave allowed them to fall to the rear</s>  however they cant be far behind</s> they waited for half an hour but the silence continued unbroken</s> do you shout osgod wulf said they ought to hear miles away on a stillnight like this</s> osgodwho had scarcely spoken since his fall so furious was he at havingbeen outwitted by a boy and having not only allowed him to escape butbeing himself rolled in the mireraised his voice in a tremendous shout</s> all listened intently but no answering sound came back</s> they must have gone altogether wrong wulf said</s>  you know that wecrossed a streamlet that ran into this brook soon after we started</s>  theymust have followed that up thinking we had done so and have gone up someother valley</s>  what is to be done beorn</s> we crossed that streamlet half an hour after starting beorn said andas we have spent half an hour here they must have by this time marched upit twohours journey and if we retrace our steps to that point they willhave got an hour and a half farther away besides they may have gone backwhen they missed us</s>  there is no saying which way to look for them</s>  i thinkwe had better go on as before</s>  in the morning we shall be able to see thenature of the country but to look for people who may be miles and milesaway when one cannot see ones own hand would be but lost time andlabour and methinks we shall have need to husband

deal better off than wewere when we were driving headlong on to the coast of normandy or whenthere were but three of us in the midst of the bretons</s>  they have to findus in the first place and it will need a good many of them to overcome uswhen they do</s>  i fancy that we are very near the head of this valley theground is rising rapidly</s>  i propose that we push on now till the treescease

country andshall have some idea as to the course to take</s>  we must first of all try tofind a native who can tell us which is the direction of porthwyn and howfar it lies away</s>  our orders are to reconnoitre it and that must be donebefore there is any question of return</s>  even if i were absolutely alone iwould carry out that order</s> beorn was silent for a minute and then said doubtfully perhaps you areright wulf but when gurth gave us the order he gave us more than threehundred men to carry it out and we have now but seventy</s> by this time they were on their way up the valley followed by their men</s> the fact that two hundred and fifty men have left us really makes thematter easier than it would otherwise have been wulf said</s>  of course ourguide carried the news of our coming straight to porthwyn and it is likeenough that fires are at present blazing on the hills</s>  the larger divisionis more likely to be seen than ours and to be attacked and we shall haveall the more chance of getting up unobserved</s>  i sincerely trust that thethanes when they discover that they have lost us will at once lead theirmen back to gurths camp</s>  in that case they may escape before the welsh canassemble and attack them and as it would naturally be supposed that assoon as we had lost our guide we retreated in a body the welsh willimagine that there is no occasion for further vigilance</s> you are always too full of arguments for me wulf beorn laughed and ifyou have made up your mind to go on it is not of the least use my sayinganything against it so have your own way</s> at last the forest became less dense and when they reached its edge theylay down</s>  wulf slept for two or three hours and then roused himself andwaited for the first sign of dawn</s>  it was a heavy responsibility forthough beorn was of equal rank with himself he always gave way to hisopinion</s>  he thought over whether it would not be better that beorn shouldmarch with all speed with the force to the east and that he himself withosgod and perhaps two other men should make their way to porthwyn alreadythe welsh might be out all over the mountains and it was the larger bodythat would be likely to be discovered and attacked</s>  the welsh would knowthat on such a dark night and in a strange country they could not havegot a very long distance from the bog where the guide had escaped fromthem and the valley at whose head he now was would be the first place tobe searched</s>  however he did not like severing himself from the men who hadmarched under his banner from steyning and he finally determined that thewhole should stay together</s>  it was about halfpast two when he roused theband and they at once started up the bare hillside</s> as it gets lighter he said scatter and proceed singly</s>  we shall befar less likely to be noticed by anyone at a distance than if we marchtogether in a solid body</s>  we must travel as fast as possible so as to getunder shelter again before the sun is really up</s> the men were all by this time well accustomed to climbing and hardened byexercise and at a rapid pace they breasted the hill although it was insome places exceedingly steep</s>  by the time they reached its crest there waslight enough to permit of a view of the country round</s>  in all directionshills rose around them bare and brown and the growing light in the skyshowed that the east lay behind them</s>  after waiting for a minute or two torecover breath they proceeded at a brisk trot</s>  they met with no bogs ofimportance and after running for a mile the ground began to slopedownwards again and they saw below them a wooded valley similar to thatwhich they had left</s>  by this time the hilltops were all lit up by therising sun</s>  the spot where they stood however was still in shadow andin scattered order they ran rapidly down the hillside until they reachedthe cover of the trees</s> chapter x</s> porthwyn</s> there was a short halt to enable the band to quench their thirst at alittle rivulet that trickled down the centre of the valley then theyprepared to continue their march wulf impressing upon them the necessityfor moving as silently as possible</s> if we come upon a village of any size he said we must avoid it</s>  themain point is to capture a native and find out exactly where we are</s> after walking for an hour they came suddenly upon a hut</s>  it stood in acleared patch of ground a small herd of goats were browsing round andsome smoke curled up from a hole in the roof</s>  wulf halted his men</s> beorn you and i and osgod and one of the interpreters had best go inalone there are not likely to be more than one or two men within and itwill be well at any rate that our numbers should not be known</s> before advancing however he told the band to surround the clearing</s>  letno one escape he said it would cost us our lives did one get away totell of our being here</s>  see too that you bring down two or three of thegoats</s>  our meat is nearly exhausted and it is well to replenish ourstore</s> after waiting until the men were in their places wulf ran forward acrossthe open ground with his three companions</s>  there was no door to the hutand on entering it they saw that its only occupant was a decrepit oldwoman</s>  she gave a cry of dismay at the entrance of the strangers</s> tell her not to be alarmed wulf said to the interpreter</s> we do not desire to do her any harm</s>  now ask her if she lives here byherself he went on when the interpreter had spoken to the old woman</s> she lives here with her two sons the man said they are away</s>  therewere beaconfires on the hills last evening and they went out</s>  she doesnot know when they will return</s> ask her how far it is to porthwyn</s> the answer was most satisfactory</s>  it is but three miles away my lord</s>  itlies in the valley of which this is a branch</s> that is good news indeed beorn wulf said</s>  the boy led us in the rightdirection perhaps because he thought that if he did not do so we shouldperceive it and tax him with treachery</s>  but it is more likely that hewished to lead us so close that he could when he escaped carry the newsof our being in the neighbourhood in time for the welshmen to surround andcut us off before we could return</s>  as she says that the beaconfires werelighted in the evening he can have lost no time and the country must bearoused</s>  i wish we had the whole force here</s> what shall we do with this old crone</s>  beorn said</s>  it would never do torisk her giving an alarm and though she looks feeble she might be able toget down to porthwyn</s> we will tie her securely beorn we cant hurt the poor old creature</s>  hersons are no doubt out with the welsh bands hunting for us but they willreturn here sooner or later so that no harm will come to her</s> by his orders osgod securely bound the old woman with a rope he found inthe hut and then leaving her they went outside and called upon the men toclose in</s>  eight of the goats were killed and were then cut up and dividedamong the men</s>  after a consultation wulf and beorn agreed that instead offollowing the valley down where they might meet with other huts or even agoodsized village they had best keep along on the hillside just insidethe line of trees as in that way they would come out high up on the sideof the main valley and probably obtain a good view of the fortalice</s> in single file they made their way among the trees and in an hour thevalley that they were in opened considerably and through the trees theysaw a large village at their feet</s>  a quarter of a mile farther and theystood on the side of a wide valley</s>  there were numerous flocks and herds tobe seen grazing in it and four or five villages could be made out theirattention however was chiefly directed to the object of their journey</s> some three hundred feet below the spot where they stood a rock jutted outfrom the hillside and extended some five or six hundred feet into thevalley</s>  its sides were perpendicular save where it stood out from the hill</s> here a strong wall some forty feet high ran across it two square towersstood at the angles but there was no gateway visible</s>  the wall wascontinued right round the top of the rock which was crossed by two otherwalls each defended by flanking towers</s>  the castle itself stood at theextremity of the rock and was a strong and massivelooking building</s>  themen were all ordered to lie down as soon as the castle was visible betweenthe trees and among these wulf and beorn followed by osgod movedcautiously until they reached a spot whence they could obtain through thefoliage a full view of the building</s> it is a formidable place said beorn</s>  the chief who first plantedhimself here knew what he was doing</s>  yes</s>  i should fancy from the look ofit the castle at the end was built first then gradually the walls wereadded until the whole rock was inclosed</s>  this bit nearest to us isevidently an addition during the last few years</s>  you can see that by thecolour of the stone</s>  you see the other two walls have gateways in themwhile this has none</s>  i should say until this was built the entrance to thecastle was along the neck but they must have got some other way now andso shut it up altogether</s>  how on earth can they get in</s> certainly not at the sides wulf said for they are as nearperpendicular as possible</s>  it must be at the other end of the rock whichwe cant see</s>  it may slope a little more gradually there and they may havecut a zigzag road up</s>  suppose we climb the hill behind us till we gethigh enough to see over the trees and get a complete view of the valley</s> there is no fear of our being noticed</s>  we are a good five hundred feetabove it now and even if anyone did see us up there they would take us fortwo herdsmen</s>  of course we will leave our shields and weapons behind us</s> on attaining a spot from which a clear view of the whole valley could beobtained wulf saidthere beorn do you see the hill juts out into the plain on the righthalf a mile from the castle and is wooded to its foot</s>  i think if we wereto make our way down there we should be able to obtain a view of the faceof the rock below the castle without leaving the shelter of the trees</s> beorn agreed that it was worth trying and they returned to the menrearmed themselves and spoke to osgod</s> we are going to reconnoitre osgod and may be an hour away</s>  as we shallnot leave the forest there is no danger and even were we seen we can climbthe hill again as fast as any welshman can follow us</s>  do you keep an eye onthe castle but do not stir until we return even if you hear shouts</s>  i haveno doubt that we shall be able to rejoin you and it is most important thateven if they do make us out they should have no reason for supposing thatthere is any force behind us</s>  after half an hours walking beorn and wulffound themselves at the edge of the wood in the valley</s> there is the road you see wulf exclaimed</s>  it goes straight up thatgradual slope to the bottom of the rock then it makes two zigzags to theedge of that point that juts out a little whence there is a bridge thrownacross a gap to the point where there is a turret</s>  i cant see it beyondthat</s>  i should think they must have driven a tunnel from there right upinto the castle for you see there are fifty feet of perpendicular rockabove that turret</s>  in case of attack of course they would cut away thebridge and it would be next to impossible to throw another across</s>  theycould overwhelm any force attempting it with stones from above besidessweeping the zigzag road below</s> beorn agreed that the place was absolutely impregnable on that side andthat it could only be attacked from the hillside and by carrying the wallsin succession</s> well there is nothing more to see wulf said so we may as well return</s> you see there is a large village nestling down there just at the foot ofthe rock</s>  we could not see it from where we were before</s> well osgod have you seen anything going on in the castle</s> no my lord everything has been very quiet it seems to me that there arevery few men about for such a strong place</s> no doubt most of them are out in pursuit of us osgod we know that thecountry was roused by the beacons and that there must be a big forcesomewhere in the hills</s>  i only hope they wont find oswald and edred or ifear it will go hard with them</s>  the levies fight well when they have thehousecarls with them but by themselves and in a strange country i amafraid they would lose heart</s>  now beorn i am going down to the wall onthis side</s>  we can see that there is no sentry on it and i want to find outif there is any other defence besides what we can see</s>  it is very importantto know that as we agreed that this is the side from which the attack mustbe made</s> descending among the trees wulf cautiously approached the wall</s>  he found onnearing it that a perpendicular cut some thirty feet wide and twenty feetdeep had been made across the rock</s>  it stretched from the foot of oneflanking tower to the foot of the other the wall between them being someten feet from its edge</s>  having ascertained this he returned to beorn</s> having told him what he had seen he sat looking at the castle</s> what are you thinking of wulf</s>  beorn asked</s>  i suppose we had betterstop where we are till nightfall and then make eastward</s> i am thinking in the first place that it would cost a great number oflives to take that place by assault</s> that it would beorn agreed</s>  we have seen no place of anything likeequal strength in wales or indeed anywhere else</s> there is no doubt about that wulf agreed</s>  if well defended it ought tohold out for weeks for when we have taken that wall in front of us only athird of the work has been done</s>  in the next place i am thinking thatllewellyn and the greater part of his garrison are away in the hills</s> beorn nodded</s> and that being so it seems to me that the best plan will be to take itourselves</s> beorn looked at his friend to see if he were serious but there was nosmile on wulfs face</s>
do you really mean it wulf</s> yes i mean it certainly</s>
 what is to prevent our taking it</s>  there maynever be such a good opportunity again</s>  we have not seen a dozen men on thewalls and i dont suppose there are fifty there altogether</s>  but even ifthere are a hundred they will have no chance with our men if we are onceamong them</s>  you see the gates through those inner walls are open and onceover this first one the place will be all open to us</s> that is true enough but how in the world are we to climb that wall</s> that is what i am puzzling over beorn</s>  you see there is no time to losefor llewellyn and his men may be back tonight</s>  if they find oswalds partythis morning they will return at once if they dont they may not be backtill the morning</s>  but we cannot count on that what has to be done must bedone at once</s> he sat thinking a little longer</s>  we must cut down a couple of trees andmake a ladder beorn</s>  the pinetrees grew very close together where wepassed through them a quarter of a mile before we got here and were veryslender for their height</s>  we have no axes or we could fell a couple of themin a few minutes but even if we had them we should not dare use them forthe chances are that the villagers are forbidden to cut down trees anywherenear the castle and the sound might bring people up from below to see whowas chopping</s>  i was thinking of burning two of them down but in this dryweather the flames might run up them and we should get a blaze that wouldbring all the villagers up here</s>  he beckoned to osgod and when he came uptold him that beorn and he had agreed to try and take the place</s> that is good osgod said joyfully</s>  i have been thinking of it but i didnot see how you were to climb that wall</s> we must cut down two young pinetrees but we must not chop them down</s> it would take a long time with our knives osgod said doubtfully</s>  it iseasy enough to cut through a pole three inches thick but when it comes tonine or ten it is a different matter</s> then we must cut down small ones and tie them together</s>  bring twenty menat once with you osgod let the rest lie quiet the less movement there isthe better</s> as soon as the men were ready wulf led them back to the point where thepinetrees grew then he selected eight of the tallest and slightest</s>  theywere about three inches through at the foot and were he judged at leastan inch and a half at twenty feet from the ground</s>  two men were set to workat each tree and in less than half an hour the eight trees were on theground</s>  the branches were then lopped off and four of the stems were cutacross fiveandtwenty feet from the foot</s>  the thin ends were then placedtogether so as to overlap five feet</s>  there was no difficulty aboutlashings as thongs were cut off the bottom of the mens leather jerkins</s> the joint was made stronger by a light pole fifteen feet long being firmlylashed across the junction</s>  thus the two poles for the ladder fortyfivefeet long were ready for use</s>  it needed only to lash crosspieces forsteps and in little over an hour from the time that work was begun theladder was complete</s>  from the other young trees two ladders eachtwentyfive feet long had been constructed in the meantime and the wholewere then raised and carried back to the place where the band was lying</s> now men wulf said we are going to take this castle at once</s>  i shouldwait until nightfall were it not that i fear the return of the welsh butas they may come back at any time there is not a minute to be lost</s>  now leteach understand his work</s>  the short ladders are to enable us to cross a cuttwenty feet deep they have made through the rock when we get over this wecan plant the long ladder against the wall</s>  as soon as we gain the topevery man must lie down and crawl along over those who have preceded him</s> if we are seen before a few of us are on the top of the wall we shall failbecause they will have time to give the alarm and shut the inner gates</s> so far we have seen no one go in or out of the courts between these wallsand have every hope that we shall find no one there</s>  i expect they areplaces where the cattle are kept in case of siege</s>  our great danger is inthe chance of our being noticed by men on other parts of the walls or onthe castle</s>  however as far as we can see their attention is entirelydirected the other way for they are no doubt on the lookout for news fromtheir chief or for his return</s>  my intention is that all shall gain the topof the wall before a movement is made but if an alarm is given those whohave got to the top are at once to follow us down the staircase into thecourtyard and run at full speed to the gate</s>  not a moments halt is to bemade there we must run on to the next gate and there defend ourselvesuntil the rest come to our aid</s>  they will be taken so completely bysurprise that even if we are but four or five we can hold the gate untilthe rest come up and each man as soon as he gains the top of the laddermust run on at full speed to our aid</s>  cut down all with arms in theirhands but do not hurt women or children</s>  tell off six men osgod to carrythe ladder and place it against the wall and to be the first to follow us</s> let the others follow in the order in which they stand in rankthey made their way down through the trees</s>  as soon as they reached the cutone short ladder was lowered and the other was handed down and placedagainst the opposite side of the cut</s>  the end of the long ladder was thenlowered and it was swung over and the upper end placed against the wall</s> six men then ascended the short ladder and raised the long one until itstood on the rock at the foot of the castlewall</s> now beorn do you mount first and i will follow you</s> you should go first beorn said but i will do as you tell me</s> as soon as beorn was halfway up wulf began to follow him saying to osgodand the men keep the same distance apart</s>  do not let more than two be onthe ladder at once whatever happens inside if it were to break it would befatal to us all</s>  as soon as he gained the top wulf threw himself down bythe side of beorn and lay there watching the men on the other walls and onthe summit of the castle</s>  osgod and four men had joined them when wulfnoticed a sudden stir and heard a shout</s>  he leapt to his feet</s> follow quickly but be careful of the ladder he called to those belowthen he dashed along the wall to the top of the staircase and closelyfollowed by the others ran down and on through the gate in the next wall</s> here some five or six men were asleep in its shade while some women werestanding in front of some low huts which bordered the yard on either side</s> they gazed in astonishment for a moment at the seven men who appeared sosuddenly from the outer yard and then set up a shrill cry of alarm</s> without heeding them wulf ran on to the next gateway</s>  just as he reached ita number of men came running up from the other side</s>  osgod do you andalfred cover our rear while we keep these men in front at bay</s> the five men held the gate without difficulty against the welsh who firstarrived for these at the shout of one of their comrades that men wereclimbing the wall had run down only with their knives and could donothing against the saxon shields and long swords</s>  presently others withspears and axes ran up but the two young thanes and their three followersstill kept them back for in the narrow gateway they could not be attackedby more than their own number</s>  amid the yells of the welsh wulf could hearnothing of what was passing behind them and he was delighted when he heardthe voice of osgod in his ear</s> there are eight here now wulf we have finished with the welshmen in thecourtyard so you are clear behind</s>  our men are coming down from the wallfast</s>  in five minutes we shall have the whole band here</s>  now let me have aturn and he stepped forward and took the place of one of the saxons whostaggered back with a javelin in his shoulder</s> every moment added to the number of the saxons</s> let me know when they are all up wulf said to one of those behind himas he cut down a welshman who sprang at him with uplifted knife</s>  the attackwas growing weaker as their assailants saw that instead of five men theyhad now to face a considerable number and wulf had difficulty inrestraining his men</s> keep back</s>  he shouted we must wait until we are all up and then drivethem headlong before us and follow them into the castle</s>  if they have oncetime to shut the doors there we shall have a troublesome task</s>  as he spokehe yielded his place in the front rank to one of his followers and turnedto see how matters stood behind</s>  are they all up</s>  he asked</s> the last man told me that there were six more to come my lord</s> then we need wait no longer</s>  now beorn all is readycharge</s>  and with arush the saxons swept through the gate carrying the welsh before them andhewing down the front ranks</s>  in an instant the defenders turned and fledbut the saxons pressed hard on their heels</s>  some of the welsh ran up thestaircases to the walls and many of the saxons would have followed thembut at wulfs to the castle to the castle we can deal with themafterwards</s>  they followed him at once</s>  on the steps up to the gateway ofthe castle a desperate struggle was going on among the welsh themselves</s> seeing the saxons pressing on the rear of the fugitives those within thecastle strove to shut the door but strove in vain as the terrorstrickenmen outside tried to force their way in</s>  the two young thanes with osgodand many of their followers cut their way through the struggling mass andreached the door</s>  those trying to shut it had already seen the hopelessnessof the endeavour and had fled into the hall beyond in which a number ofterrified women were wailing and shrieking</s>  as wulf burst in he shouted tothe welsh throw down your arms and surrender and your lives shall bespared but his words were not understood and as the welsh never gavequarter themselves they had no thought of quarter being offered to them</s> the women ceased screaming and broke into a death chant many of themseizing weapons from the walls and joining the men in a last desperateeffort to drive back the saxons</s> for a moment those who had entered had difficulty in resisting thedesperate attack but as others poured in they advanced and although wulfcontinued to shout spare all who throw down their arms his orders wereof no avail for the welsh continued to fight desperately until the lastfell under the saxon swords most of the women who fought with evengreater fury than the men sharing their fate</s>  as soon as the struggle wasover wulf ordered osgod to take eight or ten men to find the entrance tothe tunnel leading down to the road on the face of the cliff and to guardit against any attack from without</s>  then through his interpreters hecalled to the welshmen on the walls that their lives should be spared ifthey would lay down their arms</s>  he was answered by derisive shouts and ashower of javelins</s> we should lose a good many men in storming those two narrow staircasesbeorn</s>  there are but twenty or thirty of them but that is enough to defendsuch steep approaches</s>  let us take twenty men up to the top of the castlefrom there they can hurl javelins down at them and they will soon see thatresistance is useless</s> they ascended the stairs but paused at the end of the room over the hallwhich had been the scene of the conflict</s>  an aged woman whose dress showedher high rank was seated on a settle beside her was a whiteheadedharper while two little children a boy and a girl stood at her knee andlooked fearlessly at the intruders</s> wulf despatched one of the men down to the hall to bring up theinterpreter</s>  as soon as he arrived wulf doffed his helmet and steppedforward</s> ask who this lady is and who are these children</s> at a gesture from the old lady the harper answeredthis is my mistress gweneth the mother of prince llewellyn ap rhysthese are his children</s>  in his name she bids you defiance</s>  you have takenhis castle but he will know how to avenge her and his children</s> i have no desire or intention of acting with any disrespect still less ofinjuring either your mistress or the children of llewellyn wulf repliedwhen this was translated to him</s>  my friend and i are saxon thanes whohave been forced to leave our homes and to embark on this war in order toput a stop to the ravages committed across the borderthe burning of townsand villages and the massacre of men women and children by yourcountrymen</s>  llewellyn ap rhys has brought this misfortune upon himself anddid we render him motherless and childless it would be but the fate thathe and his followers have inflicted upon many an englishman</s>  but we do notmake war upon women or children</s>  prisoners of course you must be but beassured of honourable treatment</s>  none shall enter this room save with yourpermission and you can have your female attendants to serve you as usual</s> while the interpreter was repeating his speech wulf and beorn left theroom and with the men ascended to the top of the castle where they werejoined by the interpreter who addressed the welsh on the walls</s>  thesereplied with shouts of defiance and a volley of javelins was poured downupon them</s>  three or four were struck the rest seeing that all hope wasgone rapidly gathered in a body at the head of the staircase leading fromthe wall</s> they are going to run down beorn exclaimed and leaning over the parapetshouted to the saxons in the courtyard below to stand on their guard</s> a minute later the welsh rushed down each intent on killing at least onefoe before he died</s>  the saxons weapons and discipline were however toomuch for them but they fought until the last not one of them throwingdown his weapon or asking for quarter</s> they are brave men</s>  i would that we were not forced to slay them but itis their choosing and not ours beorn and if they would but leave us alonei am sure that nobody would wish to interfere with these wild countrymen</s> what is the next thing to be done wulf</s> i should say let us turn all the women and children save the old ladysattendants out of the castle they would only be a trouble to us</s>  then wemust examine the store of provisions plant sentries and cut away thatbridge or at any rate cut away so much of it that a blow or two with anaxe will suffice to send it down</s>  we must not forget to haul up ourladders</s>  llewellyn and his men may be back at any moment</s>  let us go downtogether to that turret we saw on the face of the rockorders were at once given and the women and children collected and told toleave the castle</s>  they were allowed to carry away with them some eight orten men who were found to be still living</s>  they went for the most part insilence but some of the elder women poured out voluble curses on thesaxons</s>  beorn and wulf had already gone down to the turret</s>  there was avery strong gateway in the courtyard beyond this a tunnel sloping steeplydown eight feet high and four feet wide had been cut in the solid rock</s> following it they emerged upon a platform principally occupied by theturret</s>  the path led through a strong gateway under this on to the woodenbridge</s>  here osgod with his ten men had taken their station</s> the women and children and a few wounded will be coming down directlyosgod</s>  as soon as they have passed do you set to work with your men andpull up the planking of the bridge all save a single plank loosen thatso that you can if necessary at once cast it down after the rest</s>  if yousee the welshmen pouring up the road throw it over at once without waitingfor further orders then close the gate and take your station in theturret</s> we are all getting very hungry master</s>  we have eaten nothing thismorning and fighting sharpens the appetite</s> i had forgotten all about it osgod</s>  i will see that food is cooked atonce and will send down a portion for you and your men and some tankardsof whatever liquor we can find in the cellars</s>  we are going to make anexamination of them at once</s> returning to the courtyard they told off a body of men to search thecellars and granaries and were glad to find that there was an ample storeof grain to last for months together with large quantities of ale and afew casks of wine</s> so far all is well beorn said but would it not be prudent to send offat once to gurth to let him know that though we are masters of the castleat present we may in a few hours be surrounded by a swarm of angrywelshmen</s> that certainly is most desirable wulf agreed</s>  the question is who arewe to send</s>  it would be a terribly dangerous enterprise</s>  even now there area score of men from the village watching our movements from the wood above</s> at any rate we must wait until nightfall</s> four sentries were posted on the wall by which they had ascended as aftermaking a circuit of the place this was they agreed the only point at whicha surprise was possible unless there existed some secret passage into thecastle</s>  they had just finished their inspection of the walls when therewas a shout from their lookout at the top of the castle</s> a great number of men are coming down the valley he cried to the thanesin the courtyard below and they at once mounted to the battlements</s>  a mileaway great numbers of men could be seen running at the top of their speed</s> there was neither order nor formation</s>  among them were a few horsemenriding in a knot together and round these a number of the footmen wererunning in a close mass but by far the greater proportion straggled acrossthe valley some being a considerable distance behind the rest</s> they are like a swarm of bees beorn said</s> yes and are just as angry</s>  of course the news of what has happened herewas sent off to them at once and has brought them back again</s>  i trust thatit reached them before they came upon oswalds party</s> they must have been on their return beorn said</s>  it was but two hoursago that we won the castle</s>  had a swift messenger started the moment thenews reached the village and had he known exactly the position where hewould find llewellyn he could not have taken the news to him and broughtthem back here had they been some eight miles away</s>  it must be farther thanthat to the spot where we lost oswald and as the thanes would surely bemaking their way either back to camp or eastward to the border they musthave been many miles from here an hour since</s>  we know that the welsh levieswere summoned in the evening and probably reached the spot where we weredeserted by the guide before daybreak and took up the search at once</s> therefore i think wulf there can be no doubt that the messenger from heremust have met them as they were returning but whether they had overtakenand destroyed oswalds command or had failed in their search for them wecannot tell</s> wulf shook his head</s>  i fear the former is most likely</s>  the welsh here mustknow every foot of their mountains so that by scattering through thevalleys they could scarcely fail to come upon the traces of oswaldspassage and they would pursue him as hotly as wolves chase a deer</s>  my onlyhope is that oswald may have established himself at daybreak this morningin some strong position and fortified himself there in hopes that wemight rejoin him and that llewellyn had not begun the attack upon it whenthe news reached him of the capture of his castle</s>  how many think you arethere in that approaching throng</s> some four or five thousand i should say</s> yes quite five thousand beorn</s> at the call of the watchmen the men had of their own accord all mountedto the walls</s> we had better divide our commands beorn said</s>  your force is doublemine</s>  for the present i will undertake the defence of the rear walls if youwill take the front</s>  of course till an attack actually commences it willnot be necessary to keep more than a strong guard on duty</s> certainly not wulf agreed</s>  the danger will be far greater at night thanby day and we must give the men as much rest as possible</s>  but i think thatyou with your men and half of mine ought to take the command in frontwhile i with the rest defend the rear</s> not at all wulf this is your affair altogether</s>  i should never havethought of trying to take the castle</s>  it was your idea and has beencarried out by you altogether</s>  you are much fuller of plans than i am</s>  iwill do my best to second you but you must continue to be the head in thematter</s> very well beorn</s>  i refuse to be considered in command but we willapportion our forces as you suggest</s>  we will take care that at any rate thewelsh shall not capture the castle as rapidly as we did and so will putfour men always on duty at each of the gates in the interior walls so thatif by any chance they manage to effect an entrance into one of the yardsthey will be able to get no farther until our whole force can assemble tooppose them</s> chapter xi</s> the secret passage</s> beorn called his men together and distributed them along the rear wallwhile wulf made a fresh examination of the front</s>  he had before noticedthat great piles of stone in blocks from fifty to a hundred pounds inweight were piled along by the parapet in readiness to hurl down upon anyfoe attempting to ascend the road while in the courtyard below was animmense reserve of these missiles</s>  he placed twenty of his men here andposted the other ten as sentries on the side walls and then went downthrough the passage to osgod</s>  the bridge was entirely demolished as he haddirected with the exception of a single plank which could be thrown overin a moment</s>  osgod had closed the gate and had fastened a rope from thetop of the turret to the plank so that this could be hauled up withoutthose engaged in the operation being exposed to missiles from the otherside of the chasm</s> one feels almost ashamed at being so safe osgod said as wulf joined himon the turret</s>  it does not give one the chance of a fight</s> you have had one good fight today osgod and can do without another</s>  ishould be glad if we did not have to strike a blow till we see gurthsbanner coming down the valley</s> we have done very well osgod agreed and i should be quite contented ifi had but come across that rascal who nearly smothered me in the bog</s> you need not bear malice against him osgod for if he had not deserted usand led llewellyns force away to the spot where he left us we should notbe masters of the place as at present and it would have been a terriblebusiness had we been obliged to take this stronghold by storm</s> that is true enough master except by hunger or by a surprise such as wecarried out i dont see how the place is to be taken if stoutly defended</s> there is no reason why the welsh should have been in such a hurry toreturn for they must know as well as we do that there is but little chanceof their getting in again</s>  they have come to a halt now down there andhalf of them have thrown themselves on the ground like a pack of tiredhounds</s> i have no fear whatever of an open attack osgod</s>  they can see forthemselves that the bridge is destroyed and i do not think they will dreamof coming up that road which as they know we can sweep with stones fromabove</s>  if they attack openly at all it will be by the wall we scaled</s>  ifthey make twenty ladders such as we had they may think they might gain afooting especially as their archers high among the trees would be able tofire down on the defenders of the wall</s>  but what i am really afraid of isthat there may be some secret passage</s> do you think so</s>  osgod said startled</s>  where could it come from</s> well osgod you see they have cut this winding road up the rock and havemade the tunnel hence to the courtyard so the chiefs have had abundance oflabour at their disposal</s>  they would naturally wish to provide a means ofescape if the castle were besieged and like to fall by force or faminemoreover it would enable them to send out messengers or receive messagesfrom without</s>  a passage four feet high and two feet wide would suffice</s> they may have driven such a passage from some place in the wood behind andit may come up somewhere in the courtyard perhaps in one of the littlehuts along the side</s>  of course the entrance would be covered here by astone and would be hidden among the bushes at the other end</s>  still i donot think that this is likely for a hostile force would almost certainlytake up its post in that wood and attack the place in the rear</s>  if thereis such a passage i think that it must open somewhere on the face of therock on one side or the other</s>  it looks to us almost perpendicular butthere may be inequalities by which active men might ascend at some point orother</s>  for a considerable distance we could see there were tufts of shrubsgrowing here and there and one of these may conceal a small opening</s>  fromthis point a staircase may have been driven up into the castle</s> that would be very awkward master if it were so</s> it would indeed</s>  tonight all the force except the sentries shall gatherin the castle where ten men by turns shall keep guard one or two beingplaced in the lower chambers</s>  in this way we shall be safe for before morethan three or four can enter we should be all on foot and as they can butcome up in single file could repulse them without difficulty</s>  tomorrow wewill lower men down with ropes from the walls and examine every clump ofbushes growing on the face of the rock if we find any signs of a path orentrance we shall have no difficulty in discovering where it enters intothe castle and can effectually block it up</s>  i shall then feel much morecomfortable than i do at present</s> i was looking forward to a good nights sleep osgod grumbled but youridea master has quite done away with that</s>  if i went off i should dreamthat i had one of those welsh wolves at my throat</s>  however it is a goodthing that you thought of it</s> i think my lord one of the soldiers said there are a number of ourmen among the welsh</s>  i can make out helmets and shields and i think manyare clad in leather jerkins</s> wulf looked attentively</s> yes there are certainly shields and helmets he said</s>  i fear there isno doubt they have overtaken oswalds levies</s> and have made them prisoners</s> wulf shook his head</s>  they never take prisoners you know</s>  i fear they haveslain them all and possessed themselves of their arms and clothes</s>  in noother way can there be saxon shields and helmets among them</s> by st</s>  nicholas</s>  osgod exclaimed it is too bad that we should bestanding here doing nothing</s>  why doesnt llewellyn attack us instead ofkeeping his men gaping there at the castle</s> because at present he can do nothing and is not fool enough to throw awayhundreds of lives besides he must know that his mother and children arein our hands</s> presently a white flag was raised among the welsh</s>  wulf had expected thisand had ordered a white cloth to be held in readiness to raise in reply</s>  assoon as this flew out to the wind three men were seen to advance with theflag towards the foot of the road up to the castle</s>  wulf at once sent forthe two interpreters to join him</s> shall you let them come up master</s>  osgod asked</s>  they are as treacherousas snakes</s>  see how that boy led us astray in the bog</s> you cannot get that boy out of your head osgod wulf laughed</s>  there isno conceivable way by which three men could recapture this castle</s>  there isnothing for them to learn</s>  they know its strength and everything connectedwith it and they can see for themselves that we have destroyed the bridge</s> i shall be glad to hear what they have to say</s>  llewellyn himself is mostlikely one of the number</s> the little party mounted the road until they stood on the platform fromwhich the bridge started</s>  one of them was a tall figure dressed in armourand with long black hair flowing down from under his helmet over hisshoulders</s>  wulf at once from the descriptions he had heard of the chiefsappearance recognized him as llewellyn ap rhys</s> i would speak with the commander of the saxons who have in my absencetaken my castle by treachery</s> i am the commander wulf said</s> the welshmans fingers clenched and he glanced furiously at the youngsaxon</s>  by a great effort however he restrained his passion and saidcourteously i am llewellyn ap rhys</s>  to whom have i the pleasure ofspeaking</s> i am wulf of steyning prince</s>  i dont know altogether that i have takenyour castle by treachery indeed i claim to have won it by fair fighting</s> you went out with your force to attack me among the hills and during yourabsence i attacked and captured your castle</s>  i will do your garrison creditto say they fought bravely in spite of the surprise</s>  i would gladly havegiven them quarter but they refused my offers and save a few woundedwhom i allowed the women to carry off died to a man fighting bravely</s>  nowomen were hurt or insulted save those who took up arms and fought amongthe men and it was no fault of ours that they were killed</s>  methinks thatin your incursions into england you have not always shown the same mercy</s> llewellyn was silent for a minute</s>  he had indeed never shown any pity inhis forays but had never expected that his castle and family would be inthe hands of the saxons</s> i learn he said at last from the women that my mother and my childrenare alive in your hands and i thank you for the honorable treatment i hearthat they have received</s> they are safe and well wulf replied</s>  we saxons do not massacre womenand children in cold blood</s>  they will be honourably treated until i canhand them over to the care of earl gurth who will doubtless send them toengland as hostages</s> i shall try to win back my castle llewellyn said</s>  may i be sure thatwhatever happens they will be safe</s> you may</s>  even were you forcing your way into the castle i will guaranteethat no hair of their heads shall be injured</s>  and now prince it is myturn to question</s>  i see saxon helmets and shields among your followers</s> whence come they</s> a cloud passed over llewellyns face</s>  he had not reckoned on their beingobserved from the castle</s>  concealment was now out of question and he saidboldly i defeated a party of your countrymen this morning</s>  they came withhostile intent into my territory and they have been destroyed</s>  althoughhe had expected the answer wulf was shocked at the confirmation of hisfears</s>  llewellyn indeed had fallen on oswalds levies and annihilatedthem soon after daybreak</s>  having no idea that a party had separated fromthem during the night he was returning exulting in the idea that he haddestroyed the whole of the invaders when the news had reached him of thecapture of his castle</s>  wulf was silent</s>  it is the fortune of war hesaid gravely</s>  it is not to me that you have to reckon for the deed butwith earl gurth for whom i hold this castle</s> llewellyn made no reply but with a wave of his hand turned and went downthe hill again</s> i am even more than before convinced osgod that there is a secretpassage</s>  i was watching him closely when the interpreter told him that ishould hand his mother and children over to gurth</s>  he pressed his lipstogether and his face lighted up with exultation for a moment</s> what do you think he came here for master</s> he came here to assure himself if possible that their lives would not besacrificed in the event of his attacking</s> it is a pity you told him they would be safe osgod said</s> but they will be safe and even if we are surprised and slain i would notthat llewellyn should say that it was only the suddenness of his attackthat saved their lives</s>  i will place two of our best men at their door withorders that come what may they are to prevent anyone from entering</s>  but idont think it will come to that</s>  should the passage enter into the castleas if it exists i have no doubt it does we shall be prepared to dealwith them if it opens elsewhere we shall have all our force save a fewsentries assembled and though all the walls fall into their hands weought to be able to hold it successfully till gurth arrives to our rescue</s> wulf returned to the castle and then joined beorn at his post on the wallfacing the wood</s>  he communicated to him his ideas as to the probableexistence of a secret passage</s> we must provide a mode of retreat for your men on guard here beorn incase the welsh enter by either of these yards instead of by the castle</s> these flanking towers at the angles of the walls cut off all passage</s>  wewill construct bridges with two or three planks across these towers sothat your sentries can retreat from the rear wall to the next and again onto the inner wall</s>  the doors between the courtyards shall be closed sothat should they enter either of these outer courts they will be delayedand your men will have plenty of time to join us in the defence of the lastwall</s>  however i am convinced the castle itself will be the scene ofaction</s>  five sentries will be enough to place on this wall</s>  i will put twoon each of the cross walls so that if your men give the alarm it will bepassed along speedily</s>  i shall remove the last plank of the bridge atnightfall and have osgod and four men in the turret and two on the wallabove them</s>  we shall therefore have fiftyfive men in the castle and thatshould be ample</s>  they can keep watch and watch so there will be overtwentyfive men under arms and ready to throw themselves upon the welshwherever they may enter</s> these arrangements were carried out</s>  at ten oclock all lights wereextinguished save a torch burning in each room on the ground floor</s>  thefloors and walls had been carefully examined and sounded but nothingsuspicious had been discovered</s>  four men were told off to each room exceptthe great hall where twenty were gathered in reserve</s>  half were to keepwatch but all were to lie down</s>  the orders to those who were to keep awakewere strict if they heard a noise or saw a stone move they were to keepsilent until two or three men had stepped out then they were to give thealarm leap up and throw themselves upon them</s> were the alarm given he said before they fairly issued out the stonemight be moved back again and it would give us immense trouble before wecould demolish it or find the secret of the spring</s>  therefore let them geta footing first</s> from time to time either beorn or wulf got up and went noiselessly round tothe different rooms to see that the watch was vigilant</s>  as had beenarranged each of those on guard raised a hand as they entered a room soas to show that they were awake</s>  wulf did not expect that any attempt wouldbe made before midnight</s>  after that hour he sat in a corner of the daisleaning as if asleep but with his eyes wandering round the room watchingevery stone and his ears listening for the faintest sound</s>  he had nofeeling of sleepiness whatever his senses being all strung up to thehighest pitch</s> from time to time he held up a hand and ten others were at once elevatedshowing that the watchers were as vigilant as himself</s>  it was he thoughtabout one oclock when he heard a faint creaking sound</s>  it did not seem tohim to be in the hall itself but in a room adjoining it the doors havingall been left open</s>  he rose to his feet touched beorn who lay a pace ortwo away and stole noiselessly out grasping his sword in his hand</s>  hestopped before he got to the open door of the next room and listened</s>  allseemed perfectly quiet</s>  he stood motionless until a minute later there wasa sudden shout followed almost instantly by a clash of arms</s> with a shout to his followers wulf ran into the room</s>  the four saxons wereon their feet and were attacking three men who as he entered werejoined by a fourth from behind</s>  he and beorn threw themselves into the frayjust as one of the saxons fell with his head cloven by a sweeping blow fromthe tall figure opposed to him</s>  one after another in rapid succession thewelsh poured in from a narrow opening but the saxons rushed up inoverwhelming numbers</s>  there was a brief fierce fight and the welsh wereslain or overpowered</s>  the men who last emerged turned to fly but meetingthose crowding up from behind were unable to do so</s>  others ran in only tobe cut down as soon as they appeared a sound of fierce shouting and angrystruggle came through the opening</s>  when no more showed themselves wulfcalled for torches and a dozen were soon at hand</s>  seizing one he passedthrough the narrow opening</s>  a winding staircase met his view</s>  with beornand some saxons following close behind him he descended for a considerabledistance then he found himself in a low and narrow passage and followingthis for twenty yards stepped out into the open air</s> we need do no more tonight beorn he said</s>  we will see where thiscomes out and block it up in the morning though they are not likely to tryagain</s>  we can sleep now without fear of interruption</s> his first step was to examine the bodies of the fallen welshmen</s>  he hadrecognized in the tall man with whom he had crossed swords llewellyn aprhys and found him lying beneath four of his followers who had stood overhim and defended him to the last</s>  he was glad to find that the welsh princestill lived and directed that he should be at once carried to a room andthat every attention should be shown him</s>  none of the other fourteenwelshmen who had fallen showed any signs of life</s> ordering their bodies to be carried out into the courtyard wulf placedfour men on guard at the upper opening of the secret passage</s>  they were tobe relieved every hour</s>  he then went out and saw to the relief of thesentries on the walls and called down to osgod that the attack had beenmade and repulsed</s>  he then went back and slept soundly till daybreak ongoing to the walls he learned that there had been a great commotion down inthe valley</s>  fierce shouts loud wailing cries and a confused sound ofrunning and talking had been heard</s>  at daybreak the welsh were still thereand their fires had been lighted one party were seen to march away as soonas it was light but others arrived and their numbers appeared about thesame as on the previous evening</s>  there was no general movement but itcould be seen that they gathered in clusters and listened to men whoaddressed them with animated gestures</s> they dont know what to do wulf said to osgod whom he had joined in theturret</s>  they believe their chief to be dead they know that his mother andchildren are prisoners in our hands they can have little hope of capturingthis place which they believe to be impregnable to open attack</s>  at presentthey must be without a leader and yet they must be so animated by a spiritof hate and revenge and by the desire to wipe out their humiliation byretaking this place that they will not stir from in front of it</s> as he spoke a messenger came from beorn saying that the welsh were pouringarrows and javelins from the hill upon his sentries on the walls and thatthese were unable to show a head above the parapet</s>  in one of the sheds alarge quantity of hides had been found and taking a party laden with themwulf proceeded to the wall at the rear</s>  here he directed the ladders thatwere still lying there to be cut up into lengths of eight feet</s>  these werefixed at intervals upon the parapet and a cord fastened along the top themen engaged in the operations being protected by the shields of theircomrades from the rain of missiles from the trees</s>  hides were thrown overthe ropes and these hid those on the wall from the view of the enemywhile they themselves could peep out from time to time between the hides tosee that no preparations were being made for an attack</s> the secret passage was next investigated it was found that the opening wasabout halfway down the rock and that the assailants must have climbed upby a path that a goat could scarce traverse</s>  wulf set a party to work tocarry down stones from the courtyard and to block up the passage solidlyfor ten feet from the opening a sentry being posted on the wall above</s> after the erection of the shelter of hides the welsh only sent anoccasional javelin from the trees but by the loud yells that were fromtime to time raised there was no doubt they were still there in force</s> it is evident that they are going to besiege us beorn wulf said whenthey sat down to breakfast together</s>  the question is are we to remainhere until rumour carries the report of our capture of the place to gurthor shall we despatch messengers to him</s> as you yourself said yesterday the messengers could never get away wulf</s> i would give a years revenue if we could do so for it may be a long timebefore news comes to gurths ears</s>  he may possibly hear of the annihilationof oswalds force for any welsh woman taken captive might mention that intriumph but they would certainly say nothing of such a grievous blow tothe welsh cause as the capture of porthwyn and the death of llewellyn in anattempt to recapture it</s>  gurth therefore naturally supposing that we hadbeen involved in oswalds disaster may abandon all idea of moving againstthis place until the greater part of the country was reduced to obedience</s> i see beorn that the difficulty of a messenger getting through would beindeed enormous the welsh must know that we are but a small band and thatour first aim would be to communicate with gurth</s>  you may be suretherefore that they will keep a vigilant guard all round the place atnight to see that no messenger makes his way out</s>  our two interpreters donot know anything like enough welsh to pass as natives none of our peopleknow a word of the language it would be sending anyone to almost certaindeath</s>  i think we must be content to depend upon ourselves</s>  gurth is sureto learn the news sooner or later for it will make a great stir allthrough the country</s>  i have just seen llewellyn he is very sorely wounded</s> i think it would be a good thing to let the welsh know that he is in ourhands it will render them more chary of attacking us</s>  we might hang out aflag of truce and when they come up in reply tell them that he is alivebut sorely wounded and that they may send up a leech who would betterattend to his wounds than we can do</s> this was accordingly done</s>  two welshmen of rank came up to the brokenbridge and were informed that their prince was sorely wounded and that aleech would be allowed to enter to attend upon him</s>  an hour later a manwith a boy carrying a large basket came up the hill and crossed the plankinto the turret</s>  the basket which contained various herbs and medicamentswas taken from the boy who was then sent back again while the leech wastaken up to the room where llewellyn was lying in the care of his motherand her maids</s> three days passed without any change</s>  the force in the valley was seen tobe considerably diminished no hostile demonstration had taken place buttwenty men always remained in the courtyard in the rear in readiness torun up to the wall in case the sentries gave an alarm</s> on the fourth morning just as day was breaking a man ran into the castlewith the news that the welsh were attacking the wall</s>  beorn and wulf sprungto their feet and with every man except those on duty as sentries ran offto the scene of attack</s>  that it was a serious assault was evident by thewild yells and shouts that were heard</s> wulf ran up the stairs to the wall</s>  a storm of missiles was strikingagainst the hides many of them failed to penetrate but others did so andseveral of the men were lying wounded under shelter of the parapet whilethe rest were hurling down javelins between the openings of the hides</s> what are they doing</s>  he asked the subofficer in command of the party</s> they are preparing to scale the wall my lord they have numbers ofladders</s> wulf was about to look out between the hides but the officer exclaimeddo not so risk your life my lord you can see down without danger andhe pushed out the lower side of one of the skins from the wall so thatwulf could look down without being seen by the welsh archers</s>  the fosse inthe rock and the narrow platform at the foot of the wall were alike crowdedwith foes who were planting a number of ladders side by side</s>  these werestrongly constructed and were each wide enough for two men to mountabreast</s>  eight or ten of these ladders were already planted against thewall and the enemy were climbing up them</s>  wulf turned and waving hissword shouted to the men running into the courtyard from the walls andcastle to hasten up</s>  already a dozen had joined him and scarce had theseplaced themselves along the battlements when the heads of the welshmenappeared above it</s> for a minute or two it seemed that these would overmaster the defence</s> several succeeded in crossing the parapet but they were either cut down orcast headlong into the courtyard</s>  by this time the whole of the saxonssave the guard in the turret by the bridge were on the wall and were ableto form a close line along the parapet against which the ladders wereplaced</s>  the welsh fought with an utter disregard of life as fast as thoseat the top were cut down or hurled backwards others took their place</s>  soclosely did they swarm up the ladders that several of these broke withtheir weight killing many of those clustered below as well as those on therungs</s>  but for an hour there was no pause</s>  it was well for the defendersthat they had the protection of the line of hides and were thereforescreened from the arrows of the bowmen on the hill but these soon ceasedto shoot as many of their comrades were hit by their missiles while theywere unable to see whether the arrows had any effect whatever upon thehidden defenders</s>  at length the leaders of the assailants saw that the taskcould not be achieved and gave the signal by the blowing of cowhorns thatthe attack should cease but so furious were their followers that manydisregarded the summons and continued their efforts to gain a footing uponthe wall or at least to kill one of its defenders for some time after themain body had withdrawn</s>  as soon as the last of these was killed thegarrison hurled the ladders backwards and then gave a shout of triumphwhich was answered by renewed yells of defiance by the welsh</s> it has been a hard fight wulf beorn said as he removed his helmet</s> it has indeed</s>  it was a wellplanned attack and was nearly successful</s>  weought to have had a stronger guard there but i did not think that theywould venture to attack at daylight nor that they could have so quicklyrun forward and placed their ladders</s>  had we been but a minute later inarriving here they would have gained this wall and the courtyard</s>  theywould indeed have got no farther but their success would have so excitedthem that we should have had to fight night and day</s>  what has been ourloss</s> five of the men were killed many of the others had received severe woundson the head and shoulders from the knives of their assailants and had itnot been for the protection afforded by the leathern helmets and jerkinsthe number of killed would have been very much larger</s> i would as lief fight with a troop of wild cats exclaimed osgodwho assoon as he saw that there was no movement down on the plain had run upwith half his little garrison to join in the defence of the wallas hetried to staunch a deep wound that extended from his ear to his chin</s>  overand over again i saw a shock head come up above the wall and before i hadtime to take a fair blow at it the man would hurl himself over upon me likea wild animal</s>  three times was i knocked down and i am no chicken eitherif it had not been for my comrades on each side it would have gone hardwith me</s>  i was able to return the service several times but had the welshbeen imps they could not have been more active or more fierce</s>  there mustbe a hundred lying slain along here or in the courtyard</s>  i do not wonderthat oswalds men were all killed by them though after our previous fightsi held them in but small respect</s> it is a different thing osgod beorn said</s>  in the field we have alwayshad the advantage from our order and our discipline but here it was managainst man</s>  we had the advantage of position and they of numbers butdiscipline went for nothing on either side and i doubt if we should havedone as well as they did had we been the assailants</s> i am ready to own that osgod agreed</s>  i like to fight with my feet onfirm ground and should make but a poor figure balanced on the top of aladder</s> when the tumult in the wood had died away wulf raised a white flag andordered one of the men who spoke welsh to shout to the enemy that theymight approach without molestation and remove their wounded and dead fromthe foot of the wall and also said that the saxon leaders desired to speakto an officer of rank</s> two of these came out from the trees</s>  hitherto the interpreter criedwith a loud voice my lords the noble thanes beorn of fareham and wulfof steyning have given the most honourable treatment to your chiefllewellyn ap rhys wounded and a prisoner in their hands and to hisfamily</s>  nor have they altered that treatment while you were attacking ourwalls but they bid me warn you and all others in arms against theauthority of our sovereign lord the king that henceforth they will holdthem as hostages and that their lives will be forfeited if any freshattack be made upon the castle</s> three days passed without any further acts of hostility by the welsh</s>  atthe end of that time llewellyn was sufficiently recovered to sit upsupported by pillows on his couch</s>  he had already heard of the defeat withterrible slaughter of the attempt of his countrymen to recapture thecastle and of the warning that had been given the welsh that if the attackwas renewed the lives of himself and his family would be forfeited</s>  beornand wulf paid him a visit as soon as they heard that he was in a conditionto talk to them</s> prince wulf said through his interpreter it is you must see hopelessfor your followers to attempt to recapture this castle</s>  the bridge isdestroyed the secret passage by which you entered blocked up and we canresist any attack upon the rear wall</s>  we have shown you and yours a mercysuch as you would certainly not have extended to english men and womenunder similar circumstances and grieved as we should be to be obliged toproceed to extremities with prisoners yet were the castle again attackedand were we to see that there was a prospect of its being recaptured weshould not hesitate to slay you as it would be treachery to the king toallow so formidable an enemy as yourself to regain his freedom</s> your cause is hopeless</s>  harold tostig and gurth are carrying fire andsword through your valleys and your people will have to choose betweensubmission and death</s>  why should so hopeless a struggle continue</s>  gurthwill be here shortly and then the fate that has befallen the districtsalready subdued will light upon yours</s>  surely it will be better foryourself and your people that this should be averted</s>  this can only be doneby your sending orders to your followers to scatter to their homes and tolay down their arms</s>  we will at once in that case send a messenger to theearl to tell him that the district has submitted</s>  i must request that inorder the message shall reach him you shall bid two officers of rankaccompany our messenger to gurths camp we giving them our undertakingthat they shall be allowed to leave it unmolested</s> your offer tallies with my own intentions llewellyn said</s>  had i beenfree i would have resisted to the last but as a prisoner and with mymother and children in your hands i am powerless</s>  my harper tells me thatfully four hundred of my followers fell in the attack and with mystronghold in your power my tribesmen without a leader and your armiesdesolating the land i see that further resistance here would but add tothe misfortunes of my people</s>  i am ready therefore to send down my harperand doctor to bid four of my chiefs come up here under your safe conduct</s> i shall lay the matter before them and tell them that i being a prisonercan no longer give them orders but shall point out to them that in myopinion further resistance can but bring terrible disasters upon thedistrict</s>  this on their return they will lay before their men and if asi trust these will agree to scatter to their homes they will furnish theescort you desire for your messenger</s> two hours later three of the chiefs summoned arrived the fourth havingfallen in the assault</s>  they had a private interview with llewellyn and thenleft</s>  a great meeting was held down in the valley and in the afternoon thethree chiefs and six others came up to the castle and formally made theirsubmission before beorn and wulf and besought them to send a messenger tothe earl praying him to forgive past offences and to have mercy on thepeople</s>  an hour later two of the saxons bearing a letter from beorn andwulf to gurth started under an escort provided by the chiefs</s> chapter xii</s> edith</s> two days after the departure of the messengers from the castle the lookoutgave notice that he perceived a large body of horsemen and footmen comingdown the valley and half an hour later the banner of gurth could be madeout</s>  the garrison at once set to work to replace the planking of thebridge and this was accomplished by the time that the saxon earlaccompanied by several thanes and followed by a strong body of troopsreached the platform at the other end</s>  as he did so beorn and wulf crossedthe bridge to meet him</s> you have done well indeed thanes</s>  gurth exclaimed</s>  you have made aconquest to be proud of for as we rode along this place seemed to uswellnigh impregnable</s>  but your messengers have told me how you capturedit and how stoutly you have since defended it</s>  it was a daring thoughtindeed to attempt the assault of such a place with a handful of men</s>  youhave rendered a splendid service to the king for with the capture of thisfortress and of llewellyn himself and his children there is no fear thatthere will be trouble in this part of wales for years to come</s>  we too arespecially indebted to you for had we been forced to besiege this place itcould only have been taken with a vast loss of life and it might well haveresisted all our efforts</s>  that seventy men should have taken it even ifweakly defended is wonderful indeed</s> it is to wulf my lord that the credit is chiefly due beorn said</s>  itwas he who proposed and planned the attack and though i have done my bestto support him i have but acted as his second in command</s>  he isquickerwitted than i am and far more fitted to lead</s> wulf was about to speak when gurth stopped him with a gesture of the hand</s> at any rate beorn he said you possess qualities that are by no meanscommon</s>  that you are a brave soldier i know well but so i trust are all mythanes still it is not every one who has the wit to perceive that anotherhas sharper wits than himself still fewer who would have the generosity tostand aside and to give the major share in an exploit like this to another</s> what you may lose in credit by your avowal you will at least gain in theesteem of us all</s>  now commandant he said to wulf with a smile show usthe way into this capture of yours</s> before entering the castle itself gurth made a detour of the walls andupon seeing them was still more surprised than before at the manner inwhich the capture had been effected</s> you see thanes he said the matter hinged on the possession of thesegates through the cross walls</s>  that the rear walls should have been takenby surprise was a daring action but it would have availed nothing had thegarrison had time to close even the second of these gates for though asit seems no more numerous than our men they could have easily held ituntil reinforced from the village below and would then have turned thetables on their assailants</s>  the capture was due to the quickness andboldness with which wulf and beorn with the few men who had obtained afooting on the wall when the alarm was given rushed forward and held theinner gateway until the rest came up</s> gurth paused for a time on the wall above the point where the secretpassage came out on the face of the rock and having asked many questionsas to how it was that they were so well prepared for llewellyn and hisfollowers when they made the attack he commended wulf very strongly forhis conduct in this matter</s> others might have taken the castle as you did young thane he said butassuredly most would have lost it again for having set guards on the wallsthey would have given themselves up to feasting and sleep without athought that there might possibly exist a secret passage through this rockwhich looks as if nothing short of a winged army could scale

ofthe swanneck</s>  she was by birth far inferior in position to harold</s>  therelation between them was similar to that known throughout the middle agesas lefthand marriages</s>  these were marriages contracted between men of highrank and ladies of inferior position and while they lasted were regardedas being lawful but they could be and frequently were broken off whenfor politic or other reasons the prince or noble had to seek anotheralliance</s>  the lady was of great beauty and talent and exercised a largeinfluence over harold</s>  this was always employed for good and she was muchbeloved by the saxons</s> the alliance had been formed while harold was quite a young man and he andedith were fondly attached to each other</s>  his rise however to theposition of the foremost man in england and the prospect of his accessionto the throne rendered it probable that ere long he would be obliged tomarry one who would strengthen his position and would from her high birthbe fitted to share the crown with him</s>  william of normandy was perfectlywell aware of the relation in which edith stood to harold and had notregarded her as any obstacle to the earls marriage with his daughter andeven harold himself had not attempted to give it as a reason for decliningthe offer of the hand of the norman princess</s> as they rode down to hampton the earl said i dare say you are somewhatsurprised at my leaving the court at this crisis wulf but in truth i wantto keep my hands free</s>  tostig you know is rash and impetuous</s>  i love himwell but am not blind to his faults and i fear that the people ofnorthumbria have some just cause for complaint against him</s>  he isconstantly away from his earldom</s>  he was absent for months when he went torome and he spends a great part of his time either at the court here orwith the king at his huntinglodges</s>  the northumbrians are a proud peopleand it is small wonder that they object to be governed by an absent earl</s> tostig is furious at what he terms the insolence of the northumbrians andi would fain avoid all questions of dispute with him</s>  it is not improbablethat the king and his councillors may be called upon to hear the complaintsof the northumbrians and to decide between them and tostig</s>  this will bebitter enough for my brother</s>  he may return at any moment and i greatlywish to avoid all

look of earnest resolve in her face thatdeeply impressed him</s>  he had moved a short distance away and now turnedand looked out of the window while they exchanged a few more words havingbeen as he saw altogether oblivious of his presence in the earnestnesswith which they both spoke</s> for a week harold remained at hampton</s>  wulf saw that he was much troubledin his mind and concluded that the messengers who came and went every daywere the bearers of bad tidings</s>  it was seldom that he was away from theside of edith</s>  when they were together she was always bright but once ortwice

laid his orders on me toproceed at once to town and indeed the news is wellnigh as bad as can be</s> the gemot has voted the deposition of tostig has even had the insolence todeclare him an outlaw and

of their meeting</s>  two hundred of tostigs personal followers have sincebeen massacred his treasury has been broken open and all its contentscarried off</s>  the election of morcar shows but too plainly the designs ofthe earls of mercia</s>  they wish to divide england into two portions and toreign supreme north of the wellan</s>  this will give them full half ofengland and would assuredly

avert a war like this</s>  every sacrifice must be made ratherthan that the men of the north and south of england should fly at eachothers throats</s> the earl scarcely spoke a word during the ride to london but rode absorbedin his thoughts with a sad and anxious countenance</s> day after day the news became more serious</s>  morcar accepted the earldom ofnorthumbria hurried to york and placing himself at the head of thenorthumbrian forces marched south being joined on the way by the men oflincoln nottingham and derby in all of which shires the danish elementwas very strong</s>  at northampton which had formed part of the government oftostig morcar was joined by his brother edwin at the head of the forces ofmercia together with a large body of welsh</s>  they found the people ofnorthampton less favourable to their cause than they had expected and inrevenge harried the whole country killing and burning and carrying offthe cattle as booty and the men as slaves</s> harold bore the brunt of the trouble alone for regardless of the factthat half the kingdom was in a flame king edward and tostig continuedtheir hunting expeditions in wiltshire in spite of the urgent messagessent by harold entreating them to return</s>  in the meantime still hopingthat peace might in some way be preserved harold sent messages to all thethanes of importance in wessex ordering them to prepare to march to londonwith the whole of their retainers and levies as soon as they receivedorders to get in motion</s>  but while he still tarried in wiltshire the kingacceded to harolds request that he might be empowered to go to northamptonto treat in edwards name with the rebels</s> as soon as he received this permission harold hastened to northamptonaccompanied by only half a dozen of his thanes among whom was wulf</s>  he wasreceived with respect by the rebels but when their leaders assembled andin the kings name he called upon them to lay down their arms to ceasefrom ravaging and to lay any complaints they might have to make againsttostig before the king or the national gemot he met with a flat refusal</s> they would not listen to any proposition that involved the possibility ofthe return of tostig and boldly said that if the king wished to retainnorthumbria as part of his realm he must confirm the sentence of theirgemot upon tostig and must recognize their election of morcar to theearldom</s> in all this harold perceived clearly enough that although it was thenorthumbrian leaders who were speaking they were acting entirely under theinfluence of edwin and morcar</s>  all that he could obtain was that some ofthe northern thanes should accompany him to lay their demands before theking himself</s>  edward upon hearing by a swift messenger sent by harold ofthe failure of his attempt to induce the northumbrians to lay down theirarms reluctantly abandoned the pleasures of the chase and proceeded tobretford near salisbury where there was a royal house and summoned awitenagemot</s>  as however the occasion was urgent it was attended only bythe kings chief councillors and by the thanes of that part of wessex</s> between tostig and harold the quarrel that the latter had feared hadalready broken out</s>  harold was anxious above all things for peace andalthough the blow to his own interests and to those of his family by thetransfer of northumbria from his brother to one of the mercian earls was amost serious one he preferred that even this should take place toembarking in a war that would involve the whole of england</s>  tostig was sofurious at finding that harold was not willing to push matters to the lastextremity in his favour that he accused him of being the secret instigatorof the northumbrian revolt</s>  the absurdity of such an accusation wasevident</s>  it was as much to harolds interest as to that of tostig that thegreat northern earldom should remain in the hands of his family but anangry man does not reason and tostigs fury was roused to the highestpoint by the outspoken utterances of many of the members of thewitenagemot</s>  these boldly accused him of cruelty and avarice and declaredthat many of his acts of severity were caused by his determination under ashow of justice to possess himself of the wealth of those he condemned</s> tostig then rose and declared before the assembly that the whole rising wasthe work of harold</s> the latter simply denied the charge on oath and his word was accepted assufficient</s>  the witan then turned to the question as to how the revolt wasto be dealt with</s>  the king was vehemently in favour of putting it down byforce of arms</s>  tostig was of all the saxons his favourite friend and heconsidered the insult offered to him as dealt against himself</s>  sodetermined was he that he sent out orders for the whole of the forces ofwessex to march and join the royal standard</s>  in vain harold and edwardswisest councillors endeavoured to dissuade him from a step that woulddeluge the country in blood and might lead to terrible disaster</s>  in vainthey pointed out that while all the thanes would willingly put their forcesat his disposal to resist a foreign foe or even to repel an invasion fromthe north they would not risk life and fortune in an endeavour to force agovernor upon a people who hated him and as most thought with goodreason</s> the king was immovable but harold and his councillors took steps quietlyto inform the thanes that the witan was opposed to the order and that forthe present no harm would be done by disregarding the royal mandate</s>  theking in his anger and mortification at finding himself unable to marchagainst the rebels with an overwhelming force fell ill and the control ofaffairs passed into harolds hands and the king whose fits of passionthough extreme while they lasted were but shortlived gave him full powerto deal with the matter as he thought best</s> harold had done all that he could for tostig when he went to northamptonbut had failed</s>  there was no alternative now between a great war followedprobably by a complete split of the kingdom or acquiescence in the demandsof the men of the north</s>  he did not hesitate but in the name of the kingconfirmed the decisions arrived at by the gemot of yorkrecognized morcaras earl of northumbria and granted a complete amnesty

morcarinfluence mercia and the north to declare for another what remains but abreaking up of the kingdom with perhaps a great war</s> i cannot do it and i will not harold said stopping in his walk andstanding before her</s>  my life my work all save you i will give up forenglandbut you i will not</s> edith turned even paler than before</s>  you will not give me up harold butyou cannot hold me</s>  i can bear my life in seclusion and retirement and caneven be happy in the thought of our past love of your greatness and inthe peace of england which i should have the consolation of knowing

break the knot if youwill not do so and i could die with a smile on my lips knowing that i wasdying for your good and englands</s>  if you will not break the bond deathshall do so and ere tomorrows

dropped it in the fire that blazed on the hearth</s>  there is theend of it but not the end of our love</s>  i shall think of you and pray foryou always harold</s>  oh my dear lord and master do not make it too hardfor me</s>  and she threw herself on his neck in a passion of tears</s>  for twoor three minutes they stood locked in each others close embrace then shewithdrew herself from his arms</s> farewell she said</s>  you have left my side many a time for battle and weparted bravely though we knew we might never meet again</s>  let us part sonow</s>  we have each our battles to fight but god will comfort us both forour sacrifice will have brought peace to england</s>  farewell my dear lordfarewell</s>  she touched his hand lightly and then tottered from the roomfalling senseless as soon as she had closed the door behind her</s> harold sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands while hisbreast heaved with short sobs</s>  so he sat for some time then he stood up</s> she is stronger and braver than i he murmured but she is right</s>  onlyby this sacrifice can england be saved but even so i could not have madeit but i know her so well that i feel she would carry out her threatwithout hesitation</s>  then he went out of the house but instead ofreturning to the town took his way to the lonely path by the river andthere for hours paced up and down</s>  at last his mind was made up thesacrifice must be accepted</s>  as she had said their happiness must not standin the way of that of all england</s>  he walked with a firm step back tooxford and went straight to the house where edwin and morcar had taken uptheir quarters</s> tell earl edwin that harold would speak with him he said to the retainerat the door</s>  the man returned in a minute and led the way to the roomwhere edwin and his brother were standing awaiting him</s>  they had hadseveral interviews since they arrived at oxford and supposed that he hadcome to arrange some detail as to the assembly on the following day</s> edwin harold said abruptly methinks that for the good of our countryit would be well that our houses should be united</s>  why should the sons ofleofric and godwin regard each other as rivals</s>  we are earls of the englishpeople and we cannot deny that the unfriendly feeling between us hasbrought trouble on the country</s>  why should there not be an end of this</s> greatly surprised at this frank address edwin and morcar both hastened tosay that for their part they had no quarrel whatever with any of the houseof godwin save with tostig</s> tostig will soon be beyond the sea and will no longer be a source oftrouble</s>  there is it seems to me but one way by which we can unite andbind our interests into one</s>  i have come to you to ask for the hand of yoursister ealdgyth in marriage</s> the two earls looked at each other in surprise</s>  the proposition wasaltogether unexpected but they at once saw its advantages</s>  they knew aswell as others that the choice of the nation at edwards death was likelyto fall upon harold and it would add both to their dignity and securitythat they should be brothersinlaw of the king</s>  such an alliance would doaway with the danger that once seated on the throne harold might becomereconciled with tostig and endeavour to replace him in the earldom ofnorthumbria</s>  this danger would be dissipated by the marriage</s> you would perhaps like to consult together before giving an answerharold said courteously</s> by no means edwin said warmly</s>  such an alliance is as you say in allrespects to be desired</s>  ealdgyth could wish for no nobler husband</s>  weshould rejoice in obtaining such a spouse for her and the union wouldassuredly unite our families do away with the unfriendly feeling of whichyou spoke and be of vast advantage to the realm in general</s>  we need noword of consultation but accept your offer and will with pleasure giveealdgyth in marriage to you</s>  but is there not an obstacle</s> the obstacle is at an end harold said gravely</s>  of her own free will andwish and in order that there should be peace and union in england thelady edith has broken the tie that bound us</s> the brothers seeing that the subject was a painful one wisely said nomore but turned the conversation to the meeting on the following day andassured harold that they hoped the decision would now be unanimous andthen after a short time skilfully brought it round again to the subject ofthe marriage</s>  by nightfall the news was known throughout the city and wasreceived with universal joy</s>  the union seemed to all men a guarantee forpeace in england</s>  the two great rival houses would now be bound by commoninterests and the feud that had several times been near breaking out intocivil war was extinguished</s> the moment he returned to his house harold called wulf</s> wulf go at once to the lady edith</s>  tell her that though it has taken allthe brightness out of my life and has made all my future dark i have doneher bidding and have sacrificed myself for england</s>  tell her that i willwrite to her tonight and send the letter to hampton where i trust itwill find her</s> wulf at once carried the message</s>  he found edith sitting with eyes swollenwith weeping and yet with a calm and composed expression on her face</s> i knew that my lord would do as i prayed him she said he has everthought first of england and then of himself</s>  tell him that i start in anhour for hampton and shall there stay till i get his letter there i willanswer it</s>  tell him i thank him from my heart and that much as i lovedand honoured him before i shall to the end of my life love and honour himyet more for having thus sacrificed himself for england</s>  tell him that youfound me calm and confident that he would grant my prayer and that withall my heart i wish him happiness</s> her lips quivered and her voice broke and wulf hurried away without sayinganother word for he felt that he himself was at the point of bursting intotears</s>  harold was anxiously awaiting his return and after listening to themessage turned abruptly and entered his private closet with a wave of thehand signifying that wulf would not be further required</s> the next day the witenagemot met</s>  it was solemnly decreed that all oldscores should be wiped out that northern and southern england were againto be reconciled as they had been fortyseven years before in an assemblyheld by canute in oxford</s>  it was decreed unanimously that the laws ofcanute should be renewed and should have force in all parts of thekingdom</s> until this decision was arrived at by the assembly tostig had remained withthe king but he now went into exile and crossed the sea to flanderswhere he had at an earlier period of his life when godwins whole familywere in disgrace taken refuge</s>  he was accompanied by his wife and manypersonal adherents</s>  he left filled with rage and bitterness especiallyagainst harold who ought he considered to have supported him to theutmost and who should have been ready to put the whole forces of wessex inthe field to replace him in the earldom</s> by the time that harold returned to london edith had left his abode athampton</s>  he would have gladly handed it over to her and maintained it asbefore but she would not hear of this though she had accepted from him anincome which would enable her to live comfortably in seclusion</s> i only do this she said in her letter to him because i know that itwould grieve you if i refused but i entreat you harold make no inquirieswhither i have gone</s>  i do not say that we can never meet again but yearsmust pass over before we do so</s>  you must not think of me as alwaysgrieving</s>  i have done what i am sure is right and this will give mecomfort and enable me to bear your absence but you know that even if inever see you again you will dwell in my heart as long as i live its solelord and master</s>  i have so many happy memories to look back upon that ishould be sorely to blame did i repine and although i may not share thethrone that will ere long be yours nor the love which englishmen will givetheir king i shall be none the less proud of you and shall be sure thatthere will be always in your heart a kind thought of me</s>  forbear i prayyou earnestly to cause any search to be made for me</s>  doubtless you mightdiscover me if you chose but it would only renew my pain</s>  in time we maybe able to meet calmly and affectionately as two old friends but tillthen it were best that we stood altogether apart</s> harold put down the letter with a sigh</s>  but he had little time to lamentover private troubles</s>  the king was ill he had not rallied from the stateof prostration that succeeded his outburst of passion when he found himselfpowerless to put down the northern insurrection by force and to restorehis favourite tostig to his earldom</s>  day succeeded day but he did notrally</s>  in vain the monks most famous for their skill in medicine came fromcanterbury and glastonbury in vain prayers were offered up in all thecathedrals and especially in his own abbey of westminster and soon thereport spread among the people that edward the king was sick unto deathand all felt that it was a misfortune for england</s> edward was in no sense of the word a great king</s>  he was a monk rather thana monarch</s>  the greatest object of his life had been to rear an abbey thatin point of magnificence should rival the stateliest fane in england</s>  tothat his chief care was devoted and for many years he was well content toleave the care of government to harold</s>  but after the monarchs who hadimmediately preceded him his merits if of a passive kind were warmlyappreciated by his subjects</s>  his rule had been free from oppression and hehad always desired that justice should be done to all</s>  in the earlier partof his reign he was norman in tongue in heart and in education but inthe latter years of his life he had become far more english in hisleanings and there can be no doubt that he bitterly regretted the promisehe had rashly given to william of normandy that he should succeed him</s> it was not only because the people respected and even loved the king thatthey were grieved to hear that his days were numbered but because they sawthat his death would bring trouble on the land</s>  with him the line of theoethelings would become extinct save for the boy edgar and his sisters</s> the boy had been born beyond the sea and was as much a foreigner as edwardhimself had been and edwards partiality for the normans in the earlyyears of his reign had so angered the english that edgars claims would onthis account alone have been dismissed</s>  moreover boys hands were unfit tohold the sceptre of england in such troubled times</s>  it was to harold thatall eyes turned</s>  he had for years exercised at least joint authority withedward he was the foremost and most noble of englishmen</s>  he was skilled inwar and wise in counsel and the charm of his manner the strength andstateliness of his figure and the singular beauty of his face rendered himthe popular idol</s>  and yet men felt that it was a new departure in englishlife and customs for one who had in his veins no drop of royal blood to bechosen as king</s>  his sister was edwards wife he was edwards friend andcounsellor but although the men of the south felt that he was in all waysfitted to be king they saw too that northumbria would assuredly standaloof and that the mercian earls brothersinlaw as they were to be toharold would yet feel jealous that one of their own rank was to be theirsovereign</s> the witan as the representative of the nation had alone the right ofchoosing the sovereign but though they had often passed over those who bybirth stood nearest to the throne they had never yet chosen one altogetheroutside the royal family</s>  it was a necessary stepfor young edgar was notto be thought ofand yet men felt uneasy now that the time had come atso complete a departure from custom</s> rapidly the king grew worse and prayers were uttered up for him in everychurch in england</s>  the christmas witan met at westminster but little wasdone</s>  the great minster was consecrated on december 18th and the absenceof its founder and builder was keenly missed at the ceremony</s> the members of the witan remained in attendance near the palace hoping forsome guidance from the dying king</s>  he had no power to leave the throne towhom he wished and yet his words could not but have great weight but helay almost unconscious and for two days remained speechless</s>  but on the5th of january the year being 1066 he suddenly awoke from sleep in thefull possession of his senses</s>  harold was standing on one side of his bedarchbishop stigand at the other</s>  his wife sat at the foot of the bedchaffing her husbands feet robert wymarc his personal attendant stoodby his head</s>  the king on awakening prayed aloud that if a vision he hadhad was truly from heaven he might have strength to declare it if it werebut the offspring of a disordered brain he prayed that he might not be ableto tell it</s> then he sat up in bed supported by robert some of his chosen friends werecalled in and to them with a strangely clear voice and with much energyhe told the vision</s>  it was that some monks he had known in his youth hadappeared to him and told him that god had sent them to tell him that onaccount of the sins of the earls the bishops and the men in holy ordersof every rank god had put a curse upon england and that within a year anda day of his death fiends should stalk through the whole land and shouldharry it from one end to another with fire and sword</s> the kings words filled his hearers with awe stigand alone deeming thestory but the dream of a dying man</s>  then edward gave orders as to hisburial</s>  he bade his friends not to grieve for him but to rejoice in hisapproaching deliverance and he asked for the prayers of all his people forhis soul</s>  at last those standing round called his mind to the greatsubject which was for the moment first in the heart of every englishman</s> who when he was gone they asked would he wish to wear the royal crown ofengland</s>  the king stretched out his hand to harold and said to theeharold my brother i commit my kingdom</s>  then after commending his wifeand his norman favourites to harolds care and protection he turned histhoughts from all earthly matters received the last rites of the churchand soon afterwards passed away tranquilly</s> rapidly the news spread through london that the king was dead</s>  the membersof the witan were still there for the assembly had not separated butknowing that the king was dying had waited for the event</s>  the earls andgreat thanes of the south and west of east anglia and wessex were allthere together probably with many from mercia</s>  there was no time lost</s>  inthe afternoon they assembled</s>  all knew on whom the choice would fall forharold had been for long regarded as the only possible successor to thethrone and the news that the dying king had as far as he could chosenhim as his successor doubtless went for much in the minds of many who hadhitherto felt that it was a strange and unknown thing to accept as monarchof england one who was not a member of the royal house</s>  there was nohesitation no debate</s>  by acclamation harold was chosen king of the landand two great nobles were selected to inform him that the choice of thewitan had fallen upon him</s> they bore with them the two symbols of royalty the crown and the axe andbade him accept them as being chosen both by the voice of the witan and bythe king whom he had so well and faithfully served</s>  there was nohesitation on the part of harold</s>  he had already counted the cost and takenhis resolution</s>  he knew that he alone could hope to receive the generalsupport of the great earls</s>  leofric and gurth were his brothers the earlsof mercia and northumbria had been mollified by the alliance arranged withtheir sister</s>  the last male of the royal line was a lad of feeblecharacter and would be unable either to preserve peace at home or to unitethe nation against a foreign invader</s>  the oath he had sworn to williamalthough obtained partly by force partly by fraud weighed upon him but hewas powerless to keep it</s>  did he decline the crown it would fall upon someother englishman and not upon the norman</s>  the vote of england had chosenhim and it was clearly his duty to accept</s>  the die had been cast whenedith had bade him sacrifice her and himself for the good of england andit was too late to turn back now</s>  gravely he accepted the dignity offeredhim</s> throughout london first and then throughout the country the news that thewitan had unanimously chosen him and that he had accepted was receivedwith deep satisfaction</s>  there was no time to be lost</s>  the next day wasepiphany the termination of

of the witan</s>  all night the preparations for the two greatceremonials were carried on</s>  at daybreak the body of the dead king wasborne to the noble minster that had been the chief object of his life toraise and beautify and there before the great altar it was laid to restwith all the solemn pomp of the church</s>  a few hours passed away and thesymbols of mourning were removed</s>  then the great prelates of the churchthe earls and the thanes of england gathered for the coronation of thesuccessor of the king whom they had just laid in his last restingplace</s> eldred the primate of northumberland performed the rites ofconsecrationfor stigand primate of england had been irregularlyappointed and was therefore deemed unfit for the high function</s>  beforeinvesting him with the royal robes eldred according to custom demanded ina loud voice of the english people whether they were willing that haroldshould be crowned their king and a mighty shout of assent rang through theabbey</s>  then the earl swore first to preserve peace to the church and allchristian people secondly to prevent wrong and robbery to men of everyrank thirdly to enforce justice and mercy in all his judgments as hewould that god should have mercy on him</s>  then after a solemn prayer theprelate poured the oil of consecration upon harolds head he was vested inroyal robes and with symbols appertaining to the priesthood</s>  a sword wasgirded to his side that he might defend his realm and smite his enemiesand those of the church of god</s>  then the crown was placed on his head thesceptre surmounted with the cross and the rod with the holy dove placed inhis hands and harold stood before the people as the king chosen bythemselves named by his predecessor and consecrated by the church</s>  agreat banquet followed the coronation and then this day memorable in thehistory of england came to its close</s> wulf had been present at the two great events at the abbey and at thebanquet and knew better than most of those present that the gravity onharolds face was not caused solely by the mighty responsibility that hehad assumed but by sad thoughts in his heart</s>  wulf on his return from theabbey had handed to harold a small roll of parchment that had been slippedinto his hand by a man who at once disappeared in the crowd after handingit to him with the words for the king</s>  in the interval before thebanquet he handed this to harold who had opened and glanced at it and hadthen abruptly turned away</s>  it contained but the words that god maybless my dear lord and king is the prayer of edith</s> do you know where she is</s>  harold asked abruptly turning upon wulf</s> no my lord</s> i have respected her wishes and made no inquiry the king said</s>  othersthink doubtless that i am rejoicing at having gained the object of myambition but as god knows i would far rather have remained earl of thewest saxons with her by my side than rule over england</s> i know it my lord wulf said</s>  but who beside yourself could rule here</s> no one harold answered and it is for englands sake and not my ownthat i have this day accepted the crown</s>  if you can find out where she hasbetaken herself without making public inquiry i charge you to do so and totell her that on this day i have thought mostly of her</s>  tell me not whereshe is</s>  what is done cannot be undone but i would fain that in the timethat is to come i may at least know where to send her a message should itbe needful</s> chapter xiv</s> wulfs suspicions</s> beyond the fact that the name of the king had changed the death of edwardand the accession of harold made no sensible difference in the governmentof the southern half of england</s>  harold had practically reigned for yearsand the fact that he was now able to give his orders direct instead ofhaving nominally to consult edward had only the effect that the affairs ofthe state moved somewhat more promptly</s>  such of the norman favourites ofedward as desired to leave were permitted to do so and were honourablyescorted to the coast but many remained</s>  the norman prelates and abbotsretained their dignities undisturbed and several of the court officials ofedward held the same positions under harold</s> a fortnight after the coronation a party of norman barons arrived bearinga summons from duke william to harold to fulfil the oath he had sworn to behis man and also to carry out his engagement to marry one of williamsdaughters</s>  they were received with all honour and harold informed themthat he would without delay reply to the dukes summons</s>  a few dayslater three thanes of high rank started for normandy with harolds reply</s> wulf accompanied them</s> i would that you should go with them wulf harold had said to him</s>  youare too young to be one of my embassy to duke william but it would be wellthat you should form one of the party</s>  the duke knows you and has a likingfor you and possibly may speak more freely to you than to my officialmessengers</s>  moreover you have many acquaintances and friends there andmay gather valuable news as to the feeling in normandy and the probabilityof williams barons embarking in a desperate war for his advantage</s> i shall be glad to go my lord</s> the duke knows well enough what my answer must be</s>  he is aware that werei ready either to resign my kingship to him or to agree to hold my crownas his vassal the people of england would laugh to scorn my assumption soto dispose of them and would assuredly renounce and slay me as a traitorwho had broken the oath i swore at my coronation</s>  it is a mere formalsummons william makes as one summons a city to surrender beforeundertaking its siege</s>  it is but a move in the game</s>  that he will if hecan strike for the kingdom i doubt not in any way but it may well bethat his barons will refuse to embark in a war beyond the seas which isaltogether beyond the military service they are bound to render</s>  at anyrate we have breathing time</s>  vast preparations must be made before he caninvade england and until he is ready we shall have messengers passing toand fro</s>  a few of my chief councillors the earls and great thanes refuseto believe that william will ever attempt by force of arms to grasp thecrown of england but for myself i have no doubt he will do so</s>  i shall atonce prepare for war and the first step of all is to unite england fromthe northern border to the southern sea so that we may oppose the normanswith our whole strength</s>  this must be my personal work other matters imust for a time intrust to the earls</s> the train was not a large one</s>  one ship bore the thanes and theirattendants from southampton to rouen</s>  they were received with all honour attheir landing conducted to a house that had been assigned to their useand informed that they would be received by the duke on the following day</s> they had brought their horses with them and as soon as they were housedwulf mounted and attended by osgod rode to the castle of the de burgs</s> three years had past since he had last been there</s>  he had from time to timereceived letters and greetings from guy de burg by the hands of normans whovisited the court and knew that although he had gained in health andstrength the predictions of the surgeons had been fulfilled and that hewould never be able to take part in knightly exercises or deeds of arms</s> the warden at the gate had sent in wulfs name and as he alighted a tallyoung man ran down the steps and embraced him</s> i am overjoyed to see you wulf he exclaimed</s>  when we heard that haroldwould send over an english embassy to answer the dukes demands i hopedthat you would be among the number</s>  harold would be likely to choose youand i felt sure that you would come over to see me</s>  i had a messengerwaiting at rouen to bring me tidings of the arrival of your ship and it isscarcely an hour since he rode in with the news that by inquiries amongthe servants as they landed he had learned that you were indeed of theparty</s>  but i had hardly looked to see you until tomorrow morning and hadindeed intended to ride over on my palfrey at daybreak</s> i would not delay guy for the answer we bear will not be to the dukesliking and for aught i know he may pack us off again as soon as theinterview is ended</s>  therefore i thought it best to lose not a moment</s> i see you have brought your tall retainer with you wulf</s>  i am glad tosee the stout fellow again</s>  but come in they will chide me for keeping youso long at the entrance</s> wulf was warmly received by the baron and his wife</s>  you are just what ithought you would grow up wulf the former said</s>  indeed your figure wasso set and square before that there was little chance of great alteration</s> we have heard of you from time to time and that you distinguished yourselfgreatly in the war against the welsh and stood high in the favour andaffection of harold</s>  guy has overshot you you see in point of heightthough he is scarce half your breadth and the baron looked with asuppressed sigh at the fragile young fellow who stood with his hand onwulfs shoulder</s> he looks better and stronger than i expected my lord wulf said</s>  youmust remember when i last saw him he could scarce walk across the room andin my heart i scarce hoped to ever see him again</s> he gains strength very slowly de burg said wistfully but although hehas to be careful of himself he has no ailment</s> he could hardly gain strength while growing so fast wulf said but nowthat he has gained his full height he will doubtless gather strength andas three years have done so much for him another three years will i hopedo far more</s>  the lady agnes is well i trust</s> she is well and will be here anon the baroness said</s> guy laughed with something of his former heartiness</s>  she was here when theman brought news of your arrival wulf but she fled away like a startleddeer and has i suppose gone to put on her best kirtle in your honour</s> as he spoke agnes entered the room</s>  considerable as was the change thatthree years had wrought in the young men it was still greater in her casefor she had grown from a pretty young girl into a very lovely maiden whosecheek flushed as she presented it for wulfs salute</s> would you have known her again wulf</s>  guy asked with a smile</s> i should certainly have known her though she has so greatly changedwulf replied</s>  i thought that you would be grown up and altered but iscarcely looked for so great an alteration in her though i might of coursehave known that it would be so</s> and now tell me wulf the baron said abruptly changing theconversation how go things in englandare people united in choosingharold as their king</s> the south the east and west are as one man wulf said</s>  mercia whichcomprises the midlands has accepted the choice</s>  northumbria has as yetheld itself aloof although its earl has sworn allegiance and its primatehas placed the crown on harolds head but in time i am well assured thenorth will also accept him</s>  as i said when we spoke about it after haroldhad been tricked into taking an oath to be williams man he had no morepower to pledge himself for england than i had</s>  englishmen are free tochoose their own king and as harold has long been their ruler theirchoice naturally fell on him</s> harold is about to marry the sister of the earls of northumbria andmercia the widow of griffith of wales and this will i hope bind thesetwo powerful nobles to him</s>  the only trouble is likely to come from tostigwho is as you know at the court of norway</s>  but as he is hated innorthumbria and the earl and his brother of mercia both have personalenmity against him he can gather no following there while anglia andwessex are devoted to harold</s>  still he and the king of norway may causetrouble</s> the answer of harolds ambassadors is of course a refusal</s> assuredly wulf said</s>  i do not know the exact import of the reply asalthough i have accompanied them i am not a member of the embassy beingtoo young to be intrusted with so weighty a matter</s>  but there can be butone answer</s>  harold is powerless to carry out his oath</s>  he had the choice ofbecoming king of england and thus defending our rights and freedom or ofrefusing the crown in which case he must have fled here and could havegiven no aid whatever to william as he himself would be regarded as theworst of traitors by the english</s>  the duke must be perfectly well awarethat a king of england could not without the assent of the people accepta foreign prince as his liege lord</s>
that is plainly so wulf and although the duke professes intenseindignation against harold he himself has over and over again broken hisown oaths of allegiance to the king of france</s>  breaches of oaths go forlittle except they serve as pretexts for war</s>  it would have been the samething if harold had never taken the oath except that his breach of it willbe an aid to william in a war against him</s>  we northmen came to france andconquered a province simply by the right of the strongest</s>  the duke hasdoubled his dominions by the same right</s>  he deems himself now strong enoughto conquer england whether he is so remains to be seen</s>  at presentmethinks that but few of us are disposed to follow him in such anenterprise but there is never any saying how things will go at last</s>  whenwar is in the air mens minds become heated</s>  there will be dignitiesestates and titles to be won and when many are ready to go few like tohang back</s>  more than once already william has embarked on a war against thewishes of the majority but he has finally carried all with him and it maybe so again especially if he can win over the pope to excommunicate haroldfor the breach of an oath sworn on the relics</s> his excommunication will go for little in england wulf said sturdily</s> many of our prelates and almost all our clergy are englishmen and holdin very small respect the claim of the pope to interfere in the affairs ofengland</s> and if harold died who would be likely to succeed him</s> i have never thought of that wulf said and i should think that fewenglishmen have done so</s>  if such a misfortune should happen methinks thatengland would be rent in two and that while wessex and anglia would chooseone of his brothers mercia and the north would take edwin or his brothermorcar as their king but assuredly no foreign prince would be chosen</s> no but with england divided the chance of conquest would be easier</s>  youare about the king wulf</s>  keep a shrewd guard over him</s>  i say not for amoment that the duke would countenance any attempt to do him harm butthere are many rough spirits who might think that they would gain hisfavour greatly did they clear his path of harold and who would feel allthe less scruple in doing so should the pope be induced to excommunicatehim</s>  such things have happened again and again</s>  mind i have no warrant formy speech</s>  methinks the honour of de burg is too well known for anyone toventure to broach such a project before him but so many kings and greatprinces have fallen by an assassins knife to clear the way for the nextheir or for an ambitious rival that i cannot close my eyes to the factthat one in harolds position might well be made the subject of such anattempt</s>  the history of your own country will furnish you with examples ofwhat i say</s> thank you my lord wulf said gravely</s>  the thought that an assassinsknife might be raised against harold who is of all men the most beloved inengland has never once entered my mind but i see there may be indeed adanger of such an attempt being made</s>  i do not greatly trust morcar or hisbrother and the danger may come from them or as you say from onedesirous of gaining favour with your duke</s>  i will lay your warning toheart</s> the conversation now turned on other topics on the welsh war and the lifewulf had been leading since they last met and upon what had happened tothe many acquaintances wulf had made in normandy</s>  they talked until longpast the usual hour for retiring to rest wulf slept at the chateau androde into rouen at an early hour in the morning</s> the audience next day was a public one</s>  william was surrounded by hisofficers of state and by a large number of his barons</s>  the english envoyswere ushered in and the duke asked them in a loud voice what answer theybrought to his just demands on the part of his sworn liegeman harold</s> the king of england bids us state duke that he holds an oath taken by aprisoner under force to be invalid especially when taken in ignorance ofthe sanctity of the concealed relics secondly he says that he has beenelected by the people of england and that he has no power whatever totransfer the rights that they have conferred upon him and which he hassworn to maintain and that they would absolutely refuse to be bound by anyact on his part contrary to the welfare of the kingdom and to their rightsas freemen thirdly as to your demand that he should carry out his promiseto marry your daughter he points out that the lady whose hand was promisedto him has since that time died and lastly that although as earl ofwessex he might transfer that engagement to another of your daughters asking of england he is unable to do so as the will of the people is thattheir king shall marry no foreign princess but that the royal family shallbe of unmixed english blood</s> william frowned heavily</s>  you hear my lords he said after a pause tothe norman barons this english earl who was here as my guest refuses tocarry out the engagements to which he swore upon the holy relics</s>  i cannothowever bring myself to believe that he will really persist in this foulperjury and shall persevere in my endeavours to bring him to a sense ofhis duty and to show him the foul dishonour that will rest upon him shouldhe persist in this contempt alike of our holy church and his honour as aknight and a christian conduct that would bring upon him eternal infamyand the scorn and contempt of all the princes and nobles of europe anddraw upon his head the wrath of the church</s>  then he abruptly turned on hisheel and left the audiencechamber while the english envoys returned totheir house and made preparations for immediate departure</s> a few minutes after his arrival there one of the dukes pages brought wordto wulf that the duke desired to speak to him in private</s>  he at once wentacross to the palace</s>  the duke received him cordially</s> i marked you were with the other thanes and was glad to see one whom icount as my friend</s>  tell me frankly what think the people of england ofthis monstrous act of perjury on the part of harold</s> to speak the truth my lord duke wulf replied they trouble their headsin no way about it</s>  they hold that the right of electing their king restswholly with them and that harolds promise to do what he had no morepower to do than the lowest born of englishmen was but a waste of words</s> harold himself feels the obligation far more than anyone else and hadthere been any other englishman who could have united the people as well ashe could himself he would gladly have stood aside but there is none suchand he had no choice but to accept the decision of the witan and for thesake of england to lay aside his own scruples</s>  the late king toonominated him as his successor and although his voice had no legal weighthe is now regarded as almost a saint among the people</s>  the fact thereforethat he full of piety and religion as he was should have held thatharolds oath in no way prevented the people from choosing him has gonevery far to satisfy any scruples that might have been felt</s> edward at one time named me as his successor the duke said shortly</s> so i have heard my lord duke but as he grew in years and learned more ofenglish feeling and character he became fully aware that the people wouldaccept no foreign prince and that only the man who had for thirteen yearsgoverned in his name could be their choice</s> and the great earls and thanes are likewise of that opinion</s> assuredly in anglia and wessex they are so</s>  i know not the minds of earlsmorcar and edwin but they were at the witan and stood by his side at thecoronation and doubtless felt that they could not rely upon their ownpeople if they attempted any open opposition to harold</s> and you will support this usurper against me wulf</s> i shall fight my lord duke for the king chosen by the people of england</s> should that choice some day fall on you i should be as faithful a followerof yours as i am now of harold</s> well answered young thane</s>  you have twice done me loyal service and i atleast do not forget my promises</s>  as yet my mind is not made up as to mycourse but should fate will it so william of england will not forget theservices rendered to william of normandy</s> a few minutes later wulf rejoined his companions and before nightfall theship was far on her way down the river</s> shall we go back to steyning my lord when we return home</s>  osgod askedas they stood by the bulwark together watching the passing shores</s> no osgod</s>  i mean for a time to remain with the king</s>  baron de burgyesterday hinted to me that he thought it possible that some of the dukesfollowers might endeavour to remove the obstacle between him and the throneof england</s>  there are in every country desperate men who are ready for anycrime or deed of violence if they but think that its committal will bringthem a reward</s>  we have had english kings assassinated before now and ithas been the same in other countries</s>  moreover there are many normans whowere forced to fly from england when godwins family returned from exile</s> these having a personal grudge against him would be willing to gratify itand at the same time to earn a place in williams favour</s>  harold is sofrank and unsuspicious that he will never think of taking precautions forhis personal safety</s>  you and i then must serve as his watchdogs</s>  it maybe a difficult task for we have no idea from what quarter that danger maycome and yet by chance we may discover some clue or other that will set uson the right track at any rate if we are near him and keep a watchful eyeon any strangers approaching him we may save him from a treacherous blow</s> good my lord</s>  methinks that harold was wrong in not sending every normanacross the seas and every man with whom i have spoken thinks the same</s>  butat any rate we can as you say keep a sharp lookout and although icannot be always near his person i shall go about and listen and it willbe hard if anything is on foot without my hearing some whisper of it</s>  youwill tell him no word of your suspicions i suppose</s> certainly not</s>  i have fears rather than suspicions and baron de burgcertainly spoke as if he regarded it as likely that such an attempt mightbe made and he knows his own people better than i do</s>  he expressly saidthat he had no special reason for giving me the warning but he may haveheard some angry remark or some covert threat against harold and althoughthe duke would not i feel sure openly countenance his slaying i thinkthat the slayers might confidently look for a reward from his gratitude didthey by their daggers open a way for him to the throne of england</s> on the return of the embassy to london king harold said to wulf i have nofurther occasion for your services at present wulf and i suppose you willreturn home and increase the number of your housecarls</s>  it is not withundisciplined levies that the normans if they come must be met</s>  it is noquestion this time of welsh mountaineers but of trained warriors andshould they land they must be met by men as firm and as obedient to ordersas themselves</s>  i am trying to impress this on all our thanes but most ofthem are hard to move and deem that all that is necessary on the day ofbattle is that men shall have strength and courage and arms</s> with your permission my lord i would rather abide near you and leavethe training of my men to the officer who taught those who fought by myside in wales</s> i thought you did not care for the gaieties of the court</s>  harold said insome surprise</s> nor do i my lord</s>  for its gaieties i care nothing but in times likethese there is much to be learned and i would not bury myself in steyningwhen there is so much of importance going on in london</s> then stay wulf i shall be glad to have you here</s>  i have but little timeto myself now but it is a relief to put aside grave matters sometimes</s>  iwill appoint a room for you near my own chamber</s>  you have heard no news ofher i suppose</s> in truth my lord i know not how to set about the task and it seems tome that my only chance is to run against one of her servingmen in thestreet</s> that is but a slight chance wulf but even i with all the power ofengland in my hands am equally at a loss</s>  i cannot send round to all thethanes of wessex to ask if a strange lady has taken a house in theirjurisdiction nor to all the parish priests to ask if a new worshipper hascome to their church</s>  however i believe that sooner or later she willherself advise me where she has hidden</s>  it may be that your stay here willnot be a long one for i purpose journeying to the north</s> to northumbria</s>  wulf said in surprise</s> yes the people there refuse to recognize me and i would win them bygoing among them rather than by force</s>  my dear friend bishop wulfstan willaccompany me</s>  i shall take with me a body of my housecarls partly as aguard but more because i cannot now travel as a private person</s>  it is verymany years since an english king has visited northumbria and it is notstrange that these northern men should object to be ruled by a strangerfrom the south</s>  i shall take with me two or three of my thanes only butshall be glad for you to ride with me</s>  young as you are you have a quickeye and ready wit and in case trouble should arise i can rely upon youmore than upon many men far older than yourself</s> the palace of westminster was not an imposing edifice</s>  london had not yetbecome the capital of england oxford being the seat of government of mostof the kings so that the palace was built on a simple plan and had beenaltered by edward until the interior arrangements more nearly resembledthose of a convent than of a palace</s>  below was the great banquetinghalland beyond this the chamber where the king heard complaints andadministered justice</s>  leading from this were the king and queens privatechambers where the one sat and read or received his chief councillors andthe other worked with her maids and listened to the music of the harpersor the tales of war and love sung by bards</s> behind was the chapel</s>  on the floor above a corridor ran from one end ofthe building to the doors which separated the royal sleepingrooms from therest</s>  on either side of the corridor were small bedchambers where theofficers of the household and guests at the court slept their attendantslying in the corridor itself or in the kitchens which with other officeswere contained in a separate building</s>  the room assigned to wulf and whichharold had ordered was henceforth to be retained for him was that on theright hand of the corridor next to the door leading to the royalapartments</s>  like the others it was a mere cell with the straw palletcovered with sheepskins with some rugs for covering</s>  this constituted thewhole of the furniture</s>  in the morning water was brought in brass ewers andbasins either by the pages or servants of the guests</s> nothing could be better my lord than this osgod said</s>  i am a lightsleeper and lying across your door i am sure that no one could enter thekings apartments without my hearing those heavy doors move</s> there is but little chance osgod of an attack being made on him in thatfashion</s>  doubtless some of the royal servants sleep on the other side ofthe door</s>  no if any design be attempted against his life it will be whenhe is travelling or when he is abroad amid a crowd</s> i saw walter fitzurse today master in the train of william of london</s> then he must have returned within the last day or two osgod for he hasbeen absent for more than a year and i know that when we sailed fornormandy he was still absent for i inquired of one of the court officialsif he had been here of late</s>  what should bring him back again i wonder</s> he has long been out of his pageship and he can hope for no preferment inengland while harold is king</s>  he has i know no great possessions innormandy for i asked guy about him and learned that his father was aknight of but small consideration either as to his state or character andthat the boy owed his place as page to william of london to the fact thathe was a distant relation of the prelate</s> i would say harm of no man but i should think he is as likely as anotherto be mixed up in such a plot as we are talking of</s>  he is landlesshottempered and ambitious</s>  he owes no goodwill to harold for it was byhis intervention that he was sent away in disgrace after that quarrel withme</s>  at any rate osgod since we have no one else to suspect we will inthe first place watch him or rather have him looked after for i see nothow we ourselves can in any way keep near him</s>  he knows me well and hasdoubtless seen you with me and having seen you once would not be likely toforget you</s> i think i can manage that osgod said confidently</s>  my father has a smallapprentice who wellnigh worries his life out with tricks and trifling</s>  ihave more than once begged him off a beating and methinks he will doanything for me</s>  he is as full of cunning as an ape and i warrant mewould act his part marvellously</s>  my father will be glad enough to get himout of the forge for a while and when i tell him that it is in yourservice he will make no difficulty about it</s>  he is fifteen years old butso small for his age that he would pass for three years younger than heis</s> i think it is a very good plan osgod</s>  you had best see your father in themorning and if he consents to your having the boy bring him down to theriverbank behind the abbey where i will be awaiting you and can theretalk to him without observation</s>  you are sure that he can be trusted tokeep silence regarding what i tell him</s> he can be trusted my lord</s>  in the first place he will enjoy playing hispart and in the second he will know well enough that i should nearly flayhim alive with my stirrupleather if he were to fail me and that his lifein the forge would be worse than ever</s>
the next morning wulf strolled down to the riverbank after breaking hisfast and it was not long before osgod joined him with the boy</s> have you told him what he is required for osgod</s>  wulf asked as the boydoffing his cap stood before him with an air of extreme humility</s> i am not good at the telling of tales as you know my lord and i thoughtit better that you should tell him just as much or as little as you chose</s> you dont like your work at the forge ulf</s>  for that wulf had learned wasthe boys name</s> i think that i like it better than it likes me the boy replied</s>  when iget to do the fine work i shall like it but at present it is fetch thistool ulf or file that iron or blow those bellows and if i do but smilei get a cuff</s> no no ulf osgod said</s>  of course at present you are but a beginnerand at your age i too had to fetch and carry and be at the bidding of allthe men and it is not for smiling that you get cuffed but for playingtricks and being away for hours when you are sent on a message to the nextstreet and doing your errands wrongly</s>  my father tells me you will be agood workman some day</s>  you will never be strong enough to wield a heavyhammer or to forge a battleaxe but he says your fingers are quick andnimble and that you will some day be able to do fine work such as clumsyhands could not compass</s>  but that is not to the point now</s> you will be glad to be out of the forge for a bit ulf</s>  wulf asked</s> that should i but not always</s> it will not be for very long</s>  i want a watch set upon a norman in order toknow where he goes and whom he meets and what he purposes</s>  osgod tells methat he thinks you could play the part rarely and that you would bewilling for his sake to do our bidding</s> the boy looked up into osgods face with an expression of earnestaffection</s> i would do anything for him he said even if i were to be cut topieces</s> osgod is as much interested in the matter as i am ulf and as he hasassured me that you are to be trusted i will tell you more as to the manand my object in setting you to watch him</s> you can trust me my lord the boy said earnestly</s>  i will do yourbidding whatever it is</s> you know ulf that the duke of normandy desires the crown of england</s> so i have heard men say my lord</s> were king harold out of the way his chances of obtaining it would beimproved</s> the boy nodded</s> i am sure that the duke himself would take no hand in bringing aboutharolds death but there are many of his people who might think that theywould obtain a great reward were they to do so</s> the boy nodded again</s> the man i wish you to watch is walter fitzurse who is in the train ofthe bishop</s>  i have no particular reason for suspecting him beyond the factthat he has but just come over here and this is scarcely a time a normanwould come to london though as the bishop is a relation and patron of hishe may have come merely to visit him</s>  still he has as he thinks a causefor enmity against the king</s>  he is needy and as i know somewhatunscrupulous</s>  all this is little enough against a man still it seems to methat his coming bodes danger to the king and this being so i desire thathe shall be watched in order that i may find out what is his real objectin coming over here</s>  i want you to post yourself near the gate of thebishops palace and whenever he comes out to follow him save when he is inthe train of the bishopmost of all if he sallies out alone or after dark</s> it will not do for you to be always dressed as an apprentice</s>  osgod willprocure for you such clothes as you may require for disguises</s>  one day youcan be sitting there as a beggar asking alms another as a girl from one ofthe villages with eggs or fowls</s>  you understand that you will have tofollow him to mark where he goes in and especially should he be joinedby anybody when out to endeavour to overhear something of what they say toeach other</s>  even a few words might suffice to show me whether my suspicionsare true or not</s>  do you think you can do that</s>  osgod tells me that you aregood at playing a part</s> i will do it my lord and that right gladly</s>  it is a business after myown heart and i will warrant that those who see me one day will not knowme when they see me the next</s> osgod will go with you now and will stay near the bishops palace untilthe man you are to watch comes out and will point him out to you</s>  in a dayor two i may be going away with the king when we return you will tell uswhat you have found out</s>  till we go osgod will meet you here each morningas the abbey bell rings out the hour of seven</s>  you can tell him anythingthat you have learned and then he will give you such further instructionsas may seem needful and remember you must be cautious for walterfitzurse would not hesitate to use his dagger on you did he come upon youeavesdropping</s> i will give him leave to do so if he catches me the boy said</s> very well then osgod will go with you to buy such clothes as may benecessary and remember that you will be well rewarded for your work</s> i want no reward the boy said almost indignantly</s>  i am an apprenticeand as my master has bid me do whatever osgod commands he has a right tomy services</s>  but this is nothing</s>  there is not one in london who would notdo aught in his power for harold and who would scorn to take pay forit</s>  as this is a matter in which his very life may be concerned though iam but a boy and a small one at that there is nought that i would not doeven to the giving of my life to spoil these norman plots</s> osgod was about to chide the boy angrily for this freedom of speech butwulf checked him</s> you are right lad and i am sorry i spoke of a reward</s>  i myself wouldhave answered the same at your age and would have died for harold then asi would now</s>  i should have bethought me that the feelings of englishmengentle or simple are the same towards the king and i crave your pardonfor treating your loyal service as a thing to be paid for with money</s> the boys eyes filled with tears he dropped on one knee and seizingwulfs hand placed it to his lips and then without a word sped awayhalting a hundred yards off till osgod should join him</s> you have made a good choice wulf said the boy is wholly trustworthyand unless his face belies him he is as shrewd as he is faithful</s>  my onlyfear in the matter is that he may be over rash in his desire to carry outthe trust we have given him</s>  warn him against that and tell him thatshould he be discovered and killed it would upset all our plans</s> chapter xv</s> a meeting by the river</s> during the three days that elapsed between ulfs being set upon the trackof walter fitzurse and the departure of the king for the north the boyhad no news to report to osgod</s>  the young norman had not left the bishopspalace alone</s>  he had accompanied the prelate several times when he wentabroad and had gone out with some of his countrymen who still held officeat the court</s>  in one or other of the disguises wulf had suggested the boyhad hung about the gate of the bishops palace until late in the eveningbut walter fitzurse had not come out after dark</s>  on the day beforestarting wulf was with osgod when the latter met the boy at therendezvous</s> after he heard ulfs report wulf said as we leave tomorrow this is thelast report you will have to make to us</s>  so far it would seem that there isnothing whatever to give grounds for suspicion and if after a few daysyou find that the norman still remains quietly at the bishops there willbe no occasion for you to continue your watch until the time is approachingfor the kings return</s> yes my lord</s>  but i cannot say surely that he does not go out of anevening</s> why i thought you said that he certainly had not done so</s> no my lord i said only that i had not seen him</s>  he has certainly notgone out through the great gates in his norman dress but that it seems tome shows very little</s>  as the bishops guest he would pass out there butthere is another entrance behind that he might use did he wish to go outunobserved</s>  even at the main entrance i cannot tell but that beneath thecowl and frock of one of the many monks who pass in and out walterfitzurse may not be hidden</s>  he would scarce go about such a business as wesuspect in his dress as a norman noble which is viewed with little favourhere in london and would draw attention towards him but would assume asi do some disguise in which he could go about unremarkedit might be thatof a monk it might be that of a lay servitor of the palace</s> you are right ulf i had not thought of that</s>  that is indeed adifficulty and one that i do not see how you can get over</s>  are you surethat he has not passed out by the main gate</s> i have marked his walk and carriage closely my lord</s>  he steps along witha long stride and unless he be a better mummer than i judge him to be ishould know him whether in a monks gown or a servitors cloak</s>  it is noeasy thing to change a knights stride into the shuffle of a sandalledmonk or the noiseless step of a welltrained servitor in a bishopspalace</s> you are a shrewd lad indeed ulf wulf said warmly and i feel that youwill fathom this matter if there be aught at the bottom</s>  but as you sayyou cannot watch more than one place</s> the other entrance is not altogether unwatched my lord</s>  the first dayyou gave me my orders i went to one of my cronies who has shared with mein many an expedition when our master deemed that we were soundly asleep</s> without as you may be sure giving any reason i told him that i had cometo believe that the norman i pointed out to him was in the habit of goingout in disguise and that i was mightily curious to find whither he wentand why and therefore wanted him to watch at the entrance behind thepalace</s>  i bade him mark the walk of the persons that went out and theirheight for the norman is tall and to follow any who might come out oflofty stature and with a walk and carriage that seemed to accord ill withhis appearance</s>  so each evening as soon as his house was closed and thelights extinguished he has slipped out as he knows how and has watchedtill ten oclock at the gate</s>  it seemed to me that that would be lateenough and indeed the doors are closed at that hour</s> you have done well ulf but has not the boy questioned you as to yourreasons for thus setting a watch on the norman</s> i have told him nought beyond what i have said my lord</s>  he may guessshrewdly enough that i should not myself take so much trouble in the matterunless i had more reason than i have given but we are closely bandedtogether and just as i should do without asking the reasons any suchaction did he propose it to me so he carried out my wishes</s>  i cannot feelas sure as if i had watched him myself that fitzurse has not passed out indisguise unnoticed but i have a strong belief that it is so</s>  at any ratemy lord you can go away with the assurance that all that is possible shallbe done by us and that even if he pass out once or twice undiscoveredthere is good hope that we shall at last detect him</s> after again commending the boy wulf returned to the palace with osgod</s> i feel half ashamed of having entertained a suspicion of fitzurse on suchslight grounds osgod</s> i think you have done quite right my lord</s>  you know how the fellow gave afalse report to the bishop of that quarrel with you</s>  at any rate shouldnothing come of it no harm will have been done</s>  as to the boys so farfrom regarding it as a trouble i feel sure that they view it as anexciting pleasure and are as keenly anxious to detect the norman going outin a disguise as you yourself can be</s>  when they get tired of it they willgive it up</s> ulf at any rate was determined not to relax his watch during the absenceof the king</s>  the more he thought of it the more certain he felt that ifwalter fitzurse went out on any private business after nightfall he woulduse one or other of the entrances at the rear of the palace andaccordingly next day he arranged that one friend should watch the frontentrance of an evening while he himself took post behind</s>  as soon as itwas dark he lay down by the wall close to the entrance at which theservitors generally passed in and out</s>  the moon was up but was still youngand the back of the palace lay in deep shadow a projecting buttressscreened him to a great extent from view while by peeping round the cornerhe could watch those who came out and see them as they passed from theshadow of the building into the comparatively light space beyond</s> many came in and out</s>  the evening was bitterly cold and his teethchattered as he lay cautiously putting his head beyond the edge of thestonework every time he heard any one leaving the palace</s>  the heavy bellhad just struck eight when a man wrapt up in a cloak passed out</s>  hediffered in no respect from many of those who had preceded him save thathe was somewhat taller</s>  the hood of the cloak was drawn over his head</s>  ulfraised himself to his knees and gazed after the figure</s>  the man was walkingmore slowly than the others had done for most of them had hurried along asif in haste to get their errands finished and to be in shelter again fromthe keen wind</s> if that is fitzurse he is walking so as to avoid the appearance of hastein case anyone should be looking after him ulf muttered to himself</s>  atany rate i will follow him he is more like the norman than anyone i haveyet seen though he carries his head forwarder and his shoulders morerounded</s>  as he watched him the boy saw that as he increased the distancefrom the palace the man quickened his pace and when he came into themoonlight was stepping rapidly along</s> that is my man ulf exclaimed</s>  he knows well enough that no one islikely to be standing at the door and thinks he need no longer walkcautiously</s>  feeling sure that even if the man looked back he would not beable to see him in the shadow he started forward at a run paused beforehe reached the edge of the moonlight and then as soon as the figureentered a lane between some houses ran forward at the top of his speed</s> the man was but a hundred yards in front of him when ulf came to theentrance of the lane</s>  just as he turned into it the man stopped and lookedround and ulf threw himself down by the side of a wall</s> that settles it he said to himself</s>  no one who had not a fear of beingfollowed would turn and look round on such a night as this</s> ulf was barefooted for although he generally wore soft shoes which werealmost as noiseless as the naked foot he was dressed in rags and a footcovering of any sort would have been out of place</s>  always keeping in theshade having his eyes fixed on the man he was pursuing and holdinghimself in readiness to leap into a doorway or throw himself down should hesee him turn his head he lessened the distance until he was within somefifty yards of the other</s>  the man took several turns and at last entered along street leading down to the river</s>  as soon as ulf saw him enter it hedarted off at full speed turned down another lane and then when he gotbeyond the houses and on to the broken ground that lay between them andthe river ran until he was nearly facing the end of the street which hehad seen the man enter and then threw himself down</s> he had scarcely done so when he saw the figure issue from the street andstrike across the open ground towards the water</s>  crawling along on hisstomach ulf followed him until he halted on the bank the man looked up anddown the river stamped his foot impatiently and then began to walk to andfro</s>  presently he stopped and appeared to be listening ulf did the sameand soon heard the distant splash of oars</s>  they came nearer and nearer</s>  ulfcould not see the boat for it was close under the bank which was sometwenty yards away from him but presently when the boat seemed almostabreast of him the man on the bank said where do you come from</s> from fishing in deep water a voice replied</s> that is right come ashore</s> the words were spoken by both in a language ulf could not understand andhe muttered a saxon oath</s>  the thought that any conversation fitzurse mighthave with a norman would naturally be in that tongue had never onceoccurred to him</s>  three men mounted the bank</s>  one shook hands withfitzurse the others had doffed their caps and stood listening bareheadedto the conversation between their superiors</s>  it was long and animated</s>  atfirst the stranger stamped his foot and seemed disappointed at the newsfitzurse gave him then as the latter continued to speak he seemed moresatisfied</s> for fully half an hour they talked then the men got into the boat androwed away and fitzurse turned and walked back to the palace</s> ulf did not follow him</s>  the meeting for which fitzurse had come out hadtaken place he would be sure to go straight back to the palace</s>  ulf laythere for some time fairly crying with vexation</s>  he had done something hehad discovered that fitzurse was indeed engaged in some undertaking thathad to be conducted with the greatest secrecy but this was little to whathe would have learned had he understood the language</s>  his only consolationwas that both wulf and osgod had likewise forgotten the probability thatthe conversations he was charged to overhear might be in norman</s> had wulf still been in london he could have gone to him for freshinstructions but he had started at daybreak and the kings party wouldassuredly ride fast</s>  there was no time to be lost</s>  these men had a boatand probably came from a ship in the port</s>  were there really a conspiracyagainst the king they might sail north and land in the humber though itseemed more probable that they would wait for his return for on hisjourney he would be surrounded by his housecarls and there would be farless chance of finding him alone and unguarded than in london</s>  had it beentheir intention to sail at once for the north walter fitzurse wouldprobably have rowed away with them without returning to the palace</s>  at anyrate it was too important a matter for him to trust to his own judgmentand he determined to take counsel with his master</s> he had not been near the forge since he had begun the search and wassupposed to have gone down to stay with his family who lived near reading</s> he had hidden away his apprentice dress beneath some stones in a field halfa mile from westminster and he presented himself in this at the forge inthe morning</s> you are back sooner than i expected ulf ulred said as he entered</s>  idid not look for you for another week to come</s>  is all well at home</s> all is well master but i have a message to deliver to you concerningsome business</s> the armourer saw that his apprentice wished to speak to him in private</s>  heknew nothing of the reason for which osgod had asked him to release the boyfrom his work at the forge for a time but had quite understood that thewish to pay a visit to his family was but a cloak and that the boy was tobe employed in some service for wulf</s>  guessing therefore that the messagewas one that should be delivered in private he bade the boy follow himfrom the forge and took him into the room above</s> what is it you would say to me ulf</s>  mind i wish to hear nothing aboutany private matter in which you may be engaged either by wulf or osgod</s> they are both away and may not return for a month or more</s>  i judged thematter was a private one as osgod said nought of it to me</s> the matter is a private one master but as they are away i would faintake your counsel on it</s> the armourer shook his head decidedly</s>  i can listen to nought about itboy</s>  it can be no business of mine and unless he has given you license tospeak i would not on any account meddle with the affairs of the youngthane who is a good lord to my son</s> that he has not done sir but i pray you to hear me he added urgentlyas the armourer was turning to leave the room</s>  it is a matter that maytouch the safety of our lord the king</s> the armourer stopped</s>  art well assured of what you say ulf</s> for myself i can say nothing master but the young thane told me that hehad fears that some attempt or other might be made from the other side ofthe sea against the kings life and that although he had no stronggrounds he thought that walter fitzurse who had just returned heremight be concerned in it he having reasons for enmity against the king</s> therefore he appointed me to watch him</s> he then related the scene he had witnessed on the river bank the eveningbefore</s> it is a strange story indeed ulf and whatever it may mean this meetingcan have been for no good purpose</s>  the secrecy with which it was conductedis enough to prove it</s>  it is indeed unfortunate that you did not understandwhat was said for much may depend upon it</s>  well this is a grave affairand i must think it over ulf</s>  you have done well in telling me</s>  has anyplan occurred to you</s> i thought that you might accompany me master</s> that would i willingly but though i have picked up enough of their tongueto enable me to do business with the normans at the kings court when theycome in to buy a dagger or to have a piece of armour repaired i could notfollow their talk one with another</s>  we must obtain someone who can speaktheir language well and who can be trusted to be discreet and silent</s>  whywere it but whispered abroad that some normans are plotting against thelife of the king there would be so angry a stir that every norman in theland might be hunted down and slain</s>  do not go down to the forge i willtell my wife to give you some food and you had best then go up to theattic and sleep</s>  you will have to be afoot again tonight and it were wellthat you kept altogether away from the others so as to avoid inconvenientquestions</s>  i will come up to you when i have thought the matter over</s> is aught troubling you ulred</s>  the armourers wife asked when breakfastwas over and the men had gone downstairs again to their work</s>  never have iseen you sit so silently at the board</s> i am worried about a matter which i have learned this morning</s>  it mattersnot what it is now</s>  some time later you shall hear of it but at present iam pledged to say no word about it</s>  i want above all things to find one whospeaks the norman tongue well and is yet a true englishman</s>  i have beenpuzzling my brains but cannot bethink me of anyone</s>  canst thou help me</s> except about the court there are few such to be found ulred</s>  if wulf ofsteyning had been here he could doubtless have assisted you had it been amatter you could have confided to him for osgod said that although hehimself had learned but little norman his master was able to talk freelywith the norman nobles</s> ay he learnt it partly when a page at court</s>  but what you say reminds methat it was but yesterday afternoon his friend beorn came into my shop</s>  hehad just arrived from his estate and said how disappointed he was atfinding that wulf had left london</s>  i will go to the palace and see him atonce</s>  i know but little of him save that i have heard from osgod that he iswulfs firmest friend and they fought together across in normandy andagain against the welsh</s>  he has been here several times to have weaponsrepaired and knows that osgod is wulfs man</s>  i wonder i did not think ofhim but my thoughts were running on people of our own condition</s> ulred at once put on his cap and proceeded to the palace where he foundbeorn without difficulty</s> you have not come to tell me that the blade i left with you yesterdaycannot be fitted with a new hilt master ulred</s>  it is a favourite weaponof mine and i would rather pay twice the price of a new one than lose it</s> i have come on another matter my lord beorn</s>  it is for your private ear</s> may i pray you to come with me to my house where i can enter upon itwithout fear of being overheard</s> certainly i will come ulred though i cannot think what this matter maybe</s> it concerns in some way the thane of steyning my lord and others evenhigher in position</s> that is enough beorn said</s>  anything that concerns wulf concerns me andas he is in the matter you can count on me without question</s> upon reaching his house ulred left beorn for a moment in the room upstairsand fetched ulf down from the attic</s> this is an apprentice lad of mine he said and as it is he who has beenemployed by the thane of steyning in this affair it were best that hehimself informed you of itwhen ulf had finished his story beorn exclaimed i will go at once andwill put such an affront upon this walter fitzurse that he must needs meetme in mortal combat</s> but even if you slay him my lord that may not interfere with thecarrying out of this enterprise in which as we know another of equalrank with him is engaged</s> that is true master armourer and i spoke hastily</s>  i thought perhaps itwas for this that you had informed me of the matter</s> no my lord it seemed to me that the first thing was to assure ourselvesfor a certainty that the affair is really a plot against the kings lifeof which we have as yet no manner of proof but simply the suspicionentertained by my sons master</s>  the first necessity is to find out for atruth that it is so and secondly to learn how and when it is to be carriedout and this can only be by overhearing another conversation between theplotters</s>  as you have heard ulf could have learnt all this if he had butunderstood the norman tongue</s>  could i have spoken it well enough to followthe conversation i would not have troubled you but it seemed to me that attheir next meeting it needed that one should be present who could speaknorman well</s>  after considering in vain how to find one who should at onceknow the norman tongue and be a true and trustworthy englishman mythoughts fell upon you of whom i have always heard my son speak as thecompanion and friend of his master and i made bold to come and lay thematter before you thinking that you might either take it in hand yourselfor name one suitable for it</s> certainly i will take it in hand myself beorn said and right glad am ithat you came to me</s>  a matter in which the kings life is concerned i wouldtrust to no one but myself</s>  and now how think you shall we proceed</s>  forit may well be that these plotters may not meet again for some time seeingthat the king is away</s> so it seems to me the armourer said and moreover they may in theirtalk last night have appointed some other place of meeting</s> what think you ulf</s>  beorn said turning to the boy</s>  wulf would nothave chosen you for this business had he not had a good opinion of yourshrewdness and indeed you have shown yourself well worthy of hisconfidence</s> i should say my lord that i must go on the watch as before</s>  it is mostlikely that the norman will sooner or later go out in the same disguiseand by the same way as before and that the hour will be between seven andnine in the eveningmost likely between seven and eight in order that hemay return from the meeting before the bishops doors are closed for thenight</s> i will keep watch with you ulf</s>  were i sure that the meeting would takeplace at the same spot as before you should show me where they landed andi would lie down there in readiness but as they may meet elsewhere itseems to me that i must post myself by your side</s> it would be better my lord if you would take your place on the otherside of the open space for although i being small can escape notice youmight well be seen by those approaching the door</s>  it will be necessarytoo that you should put on sandals of soft leather or cloth so that yourfootfall should not be heard</s>  then as i follow him i would run to whereyou are posted and you could follow me so that you could keep me in sightand yet be beyond his view for all our plans would be foiled should hesuspect that he was being followed</s> i will do as you advise</s>  come with me now and we will fix upon a stationto night and afterwards you may be sure of finding me there betweenhalfpast six and ten</s>  should you wish to see me at any other time you willfind me at the palace i will not stir out between eight and nine in themorning</s>  i must say i wish it were warmer weather for a watch of threehours with the snow on the groundand it is beginning to fall nowis notso pleasant a way of spending the evening as i had looked for when i camehither</s> beorn went out with ulf and they fixed upon a doorway some twenty yardsfrom the street down which the norman had before gone</s> we must hope he will go by the same way beorn said for should he turnto the right or left after issuing from the gate he will have gone so farbefore you can run across and fetch me that we may well fail to pick up histrack again</s>  it were well if we could arrange some signal by which youwould let me know should he so turn off</s>  it would not do for you to call orwhistle</s> no my lord but i could howl like a dog</s>  he would but think it some curlying under the wall i might howl once if he turns to the right twice ifhe turns to the left and you could then cross the ground in thatdirection and i could meet you on the way without losing sight of him forlong</s> that would do well ulf if you are sure you could imitate the howl of adog so nearly that he would not suspect it</s> i can do that ulf said confidently</s>  i have used the signal before withmy comrades and to make sure will go out to the fields and practisedaily</s> a month passed</s>  harold was still away in the north and complete successwas attending his journey</s>  the influence of bishop wulfstan who wasgreatly respected throughout the kingdom did much but harold himself didmore</s>  his noble presence his courtesy to all the assurances he gave ofhis desire that all men should be well and justly ruled that evildoers ofwhatever rank should be punished that there should be no oppression and noexaction of taxes beyond those borne by the whole community won the heartsof the people</s>  they were moreover gratified by the confidence that he hadshown in coming among them and in seeing for the first time in the memoryof man a monarch of england in northumbria</s> ulf and beorn had kept regular watch but without success and ulfscomrades had as steadily watched the other entrances</s>  beorn had two orthree conferences with ulf</s>  he was becoming impatient at the long delaythough he acknowledged that it was possible it had been arranged that nomore meetings should take place until it was known that harold was about toreturn</s>  the armourer was perhaps the most impatient of the three</s>  he wasdoing nothing and his anxiety made him so irritable and captious at hiswork that his men wondered what had come over their master</s>  after frettingfor three weeks over his own inaction he one morning told ulf to go tobeorn and say that he begged to have speech with him</s>  an hour later beornreturned with ulf</s> i bethought me last night my lord ulred said while i lay awakewondering over the matter whether these fellows are still on board ship orare in lodgings in london</s> it might be either ulred</s>  i have frequently thought over the matter</s> possibly they may have stayed on board their ship till she left and thenhave come on shore in the guise of peaceful traders</s> if the ship did not return at once they may still be on board thearmourer said for the wind has blown steadily from the east for the lastfive weeks and no ships have been able to leave the port</s>  i blame myselfsorely that i did not think of it before but at least i will lose no timenow if you think that good might come of it</s> it would certainly be good if you could find either the ship or the housewhere the men are in lodging but seeing that you know nothing of theirappearance or number nor the name of the ship in which they came nor theport she sailed from i see not how you could set about it</s> i will first go to the portreeves office and find out the names of theships that arrived just before the time that the meeting by the river tookplace</s>  she may have come in early that day or on the day before</s>  theywould surely send word at once to him that they had arrived</s> you might learn something that way ulred but we do not know that themeeting ulf saw was their first</s> that is true</s>  but as ulfs friend declares that he certainly had not goneout that way during the evenings that he had been keeping watch it islikely that it was their first meeting</s> that is so ulred and at any rate it would be well that you should makethe inquiries and that while we are keeping our watch as before youshould try to gather some tidings of the fellows in another way</s> chapter xvi</s> a voyage north</s> the armourer found without any difficulty that twentyfive vesselsexclusive of small coasters had arrived in the port during the thirtysixhours previous to the time of the meeting on the bank</s>  of these eighteenwere from english ports seven from normandy france or flanders</s>  three ofthe latter had sailed away and of the four remaining in the port two werefrom rouen one from calais and one from flanders</s>  having obtained thenames of these he took boat and rowed down the river and ascertained whereeach lay at anchor</s>  he then with the assistance of some citizens ofstanding of his acquaintance obtained a view of the manifests of theircargoes</s>  the flemish vessel carried cloth the other three miscellaneouscargoeswine dried fish cloth and other goods</s> the flemish vessel was the largest those from rouen and calais were aboutthe same size</s>  all had discharged their cargoes and were waiting for achange of wind to drop down the river</s>  there was nothing unusual to beobserved on any of the ships</s>  the men were for the most part down in theforecastle for the weather was too severe for them to lounge about ondeck</s>  he talked the matter over with beorn and they agreed that it wasmost probable that the men would embark from calais rather than rouen</s>  itwas a far shorter and less perilous voyage and moreover as frenchmen theycould move about without attracting attention while as normans they wouldbe viewed with a certain amount of hostility and suspicion</s> i will make it my business to watch that vessel</s>  i know not whether anygood can come of it but i would fain be doing something</s>  if the windchanges she will doubtless proceed to sea and if they are still on boardof her they will come ashore and i could see their numbers and where theyput up</s> that will indeed be important beorn said for we should then have twoplaces to watch and should be almost certain to get to the root of thematter</s>  but how will you watch her</s> there are many houses near the waters edge on the southern side of theriver near which the ship is lying she having moved away from the quayswhen she discharged her cargo</s>  i will hire a room in one of these and willthere pass as much of my time as i can and i will take with me myapprentice ernulf whom i shall bid keep his eye upon the ship whenever imyself am away</s>  i need say nothing whatever of the reason of my desire thati should be acquainted with everything that passes on board</s> ulred succeeded in getting a room exactly opposite the french vessel andsitting back from the window was able himself unseen to noticeeverything that passed on board the ship which lay scarce her own lengthfrom the shore</s>  upon the third day a boat containing a man wearing an amplecloak with a hood which was pulled far over his face rowed up to the sideof the ship and climbed up right nimbly into her waist</s> it is a saxon cloak the armourer said to himself but those are normanleggings</s>  the man is tall and the quickness with which he climbed overshows that he is young</s>  i doubt not that it is our man</s>  i would give ayears profits of the forge to be hidden down below at present</s>  however itis much to have learnt that this is really the ship and that the normansfriends are still on board</s>  i would that wulf were in london</s>  he has a keenwit and would hit on some plan by which we might get to the bottom of thematter</s>  beorn is a brave young thane and were wulf here would second himvaliantly but he has none of the others quickness of thought</s>  as soon asthis fellow leaves the ship i will hurry back to take counsel with him andhear what the boy ulf who is a marvellously shrewd little knave may thinkof the matter</s> half an hour later the boat put off again a man came to the side with thevisitor and retired below as soon as he left the ship</s>  ulred at oncehurried off hailed a boat a short distance higher up and was rowed towestminster</s>  as soon as he gained the house he despatched ulf to beorn</s>  thelatter listened to the discovery that had been made and then asked thearmourer what he advised should be done</s> that is just what i am at a loss about my lord</s>  doubtless were we to goto the city and tell the portreeve that there are men on that craft whohave designs against the kings life he would pounce upon them and throwthem into jail</s>  but we have no evidence to give in support of the charge</s> beorn nodded his head in agreement</s>  if i had half a dozen of my own menhere he said hotly i would go down in a boat after nightfall seize thevessel and put all on board to the sword</s> that would hardly do my lord the armourer said gravely</s>  on the highsea doubtless the thing might be done but here in the port of london itwould be a desperate undertaking especially as we have nought that in theeyes of the law would in any way justify such action</s> well let us have your own advice then beorn said impatiently</s>  youthink they cannot be arrested and they may not be slain</s>  what do youcounsel shall be done</s> i see nought to do but to continue to wait and to watch</s>  we are betteroff than we were before inasmuch as we know where these men are</s> yes but we do not know where they will be tomorrow for we know nothingof what passed between fitzurse and them doubtless some settlement oftheir plans has been come to</s>  they may land or may sail away for methinksfrom the look of the sky there is like to be a change in the weather</s>  yousee the norman may have taken them news that harold will soon be on hisway back for indeed a message arrived from him this morning with news thatall things had been wellnigh settled and that he will shortly make foryork where he is to wed the sister of the northern earls</s>  it may be thatthe ship may be bound thither also</s>  you left your apprentice on the watchi suppose</s> yes i bade him keep his eye on the ship and should any men leave her heis to follow on their track and mark their movements</s> at any rate there can be little need for me to watch this evening beornsaid</s>  as fitzurse has seen the others today he cannot want to meet themtonightno that is certain the armourer agreed but with your permission iwill call ulf in</s>  i told him before i sent him to you what i had observed</s> are you going to watch again this evening boy</s>  he asked when ulf entered</s> methinks there can be little chance of his going out again tonight</s> i shall keep even a stricter watch than usual master ulf said for itmay be that the agreement at which they arrived today is that they sailnorth and in that case walter fitzurse may go on board the ship and hidethere until the wind changes and they can get up saili think the boy is right my lord</s>  in a dark matter like this where weknow so little it behoves us to provide for every chance</s>  but i think notthat there can be any need for you to be on watch for it can hardly bethat they will hold another consultation on the river bank</s> ulf returned soon after ten oclock</s>  he has not gone out by my gatemaster but i find that my comrade is missing</s>  when i went round as usualto the other entrance he was not there</s> perhaps he was tired and went home</s> no indeed the boy replied indignantly he has sworn to do what i toldhim and he knows that it would be bad for him if he broke his wordbesides we are sworn comrades</s>  he has never before failed me and icannot but think that he must have seen the man go out and followed him</s>  iinstructed him that if at any time he saw a man like the one we are lookingfor he was to follow him wherever he went and to bring me word whether hemet anyone and whether he returned to the palace or went into any house</s>  ifhe did so he was to make a small mark on the doorpost with chalk so thatin the morning he would be able to point it out with surety</s>  i will sit atmy window and watch and i warrant it will not be long before he is here</s> half an hour later ulf heard steps rapidly approaching then a low whistle</s> he put his head out of the window</s> what is the news edwyn</s> a man came out in a cloak</s>  he was tall</s>  i followed him and heard a swordclink under the cloak and so felt sure it was the man we have been lookingfor</s>  i stole after him</s>  he went straight down to the river and gave twoshort calls</s>  a boat was rowed up</s>  only a word or two was spoken and thenhe took his seat in it and it was rowed away down the river</s> you have done well comrade ulf said</s>  i warrant that some good willcome to us through your discovery</s>  goodnight</s> ulf went and knocked at his masters door and on ulred opening it he toldhim the news</s> i will go down right early the armourer said</s> it is beginning to rain master</s>  the frost has broken and the wind issoft and warm</s> so much the worse boy</s>  i will be up at daylight and you shall go downthe river with me</s>  i may want to send you back with a message to beorn</s> next morning they had rowed near to london bridge when they saw a boatapproaching</s>  the day had broken but the light was still uncertain</s>  as theboat approached however ulf said there is a boy in the boat masterand he wears an apprentices cap</s>  maybe that it is ernulf</s>  the other boatwas keeping close inshore for the tide had begun to run down</s>  thearmourer told the boatman to row closer in and presently called the boysname</s> yes master it is i i was just coming to you with news</s> in a couple of minutes the boats were alongside of each other</s>  what isyour news ernulf</s>  but i can guess the ship has sailed</s> yes master i lay down by the open window and an hour before day broke iwas aroused by the creaking of ropes and looking out could see that theship was getting up sail</s>  tide was then just on the turn and five minuteslater her sails were spread and she went down the river</s>  i came off to tellyou but was some time before i could get a boat</s> come on board here ernulf the armourer said your message has saved usfurther journey</s>  he then paid off the lads boatman and with his twoapprentices returned to westminster</s>  beorn will be up by this time ulf</s> you had best go and tell him the news</s>  i will come with you to save timethough i see not that there is aught to be done</s> the thane at once came out and chatted for some time with ulred while ulfstood by cap in hand</s>  it is certain that something should be done andyet i see not what it can be</s>  what think you boy</s>  i see by your eyes thatyou would fain speak</s> i should say my lord that it would be a good thing if we could discoverwhether the norman is still at the bishops palace</s>  he may have returnedearly this morning</s> that can easily be done beorn said</s>  i will send my man to the bishopsand bid him ask one of the servants if walter fitzurse is in</s>  he need notsay that he comes from me only that he has a message to deliver</s>  if theservant says he is there i will bid my fellow slip away when the man goesto fetch him down</s>  supposing he has gone as i should think he has donewhat then</s> then my lord i think there is more danger than if the norman remainedhere</s>  it may be that the normans have returned to france and abandoned anyplans they may have entertained</s>  but it seems to me far more likely thatthey have gone north to carry out the enterprise</s> whither think you will they be bound ulf</s> i should say to the humber my lord</s>  they may on landing proceed to yorkor if they have really designs against the kings life may take postsomewhere on the road down from that city</s> by my faith the boy is right beorn said</s>  what say you masterarmourer</s> i say the same my lord</s>  the villains have slipped through our fingersand we can do nought to stay them</s>  it seems to me that not an hour shouldbe lost in sending a warning to the thane of steyning</s> i will mount myself and ride north beorn said</s> and i my lord will at once go down to the port and inquire if there be aship sailing today for the humber</s>  scarce a day passes that one or moredo not start for the northern ports</s>  yes ulf i shall take you with me</s> you are charged with this business by the thane of steyning and i am butaiding you in it</s>  i will go straight away to the city my lord and if aship be sailingand after so long a bout of east wind it is like that manywill be doing soi will be back in an hour with the news</s>  maybe i can finda quick sailer and shall be at one of the ports in the humber before thecraft that left this morning</s> by the time you return i shall have found out whether fitzurse is at thebishops palace and shall have my horses ready to mount</s> the armourer learnt in the city that several ships for the north hadalready dropped down the river and that three others were hastilycompleting their lading and would follow by the next tide</s>  he learnt froma trader that one of them was considered especially fast and beingacquainted with the owner he took the armourer with him and arranged fora passage for him and the boy</s> you will have to be on board this afternoon the owner said</s>  theshipmaster will not waste a tide but as soon as it turns will up anchorand make his way down the river in the dark</s>  he knows the channel well andthere will be light enough to enable him to hold on his course all night</s> the east wind may return again and he might be caught so he has decidedto start as soon as the last bale is on board</s>  he knows the sands well andyou may reckon on a speedy passage if the wind holds as it is or even ifit goes round to the east again when he is once abreast of harwich</s> on returning to westminster ulred learnt from beorn that fitzurse wasthere no longer having as the servant said left for normandy</s> i am just starting ulred</s>  which will be at york first you or i</s> it depends upon the wind my lord</s>  a ship can sail night and day but ahorse and rider must take some rest</s>  it may be that we shall lay to atnight but that must depend upon the shipmaster</s>  if the breeze holds andthe ship goes on without stopping methinks we shall be there before you</s> at any rate beorn said we may feel sure that we shall both be in time</s> whatever their designs they will have to lay their plans and wait theiropportunity and such may not come for some time</s>  farewell then ulredand a safe voyage to you</s>  as for me i have had enough of the sea andnever wish to set foot on board ship again for what with the want of spaceand the tossing and the sickness i would rather pass the time in bonds ina prison cell than be cooped up in a ship</s> a few minutes later beorn attended by his servants started for the northand in the afternoon ulred after giving many orders to his head man as tothe conduct of his business during his absence took boat and with ulfwent on board the ship</s>  to the armourer it was a very serious undertakingupon which he was embarking</s>  he had never before set foot on board of aship and a seavoyage in those days was regarded as a very dangerousbusiness</s>  nothing short of his loyalty to harold would have induced him tohave ventured on such an expedition</s>  it was but a few months since thatthe northumbrians had been burning and sacking the country roundnorthampton and even putting aside the dangers of the sea he regarded thevisit to the north as full of peril</s> ulf on the other hand was delighted</s>  to him the journey was full ofinterest and excitement and on his return he would be regarded as a greattraveller by his comrades</s>  his face therefore as he climbed on boardship was in strong contrast to the grave and serious visage of his master</s> before the vessel had passed greenwich he had made the acquaintance of thetwo shipsboys and soon felt perfectly at home on board</s>  he watched withgreat interest other craft that they met or passed and noted with greatsatisfaction that they overhauled several who had when first seen beentwo or three miles ahead</s>  the wind was blowing briskly from the southwestand with her great sail set the vessel ran quickly through the water</s>  evenwhen the tide turned she held on her course and keeping close inshore madegood way against it</s>  many times during the night he went out from the closesleepingplace to assure himself that the vessel was still making way</s> when morning broke the tide had again turned and ulf found that the vesselwas now holding her course near the middle of the river which had widenedto an extent that seemed wonderful to him</s> where have we got to now</s>  he asked one of the boys</s>  are we out at sea</s> there does not seem to be any land on the right hand</s> you would see it if it were clear</s>  we are just opposite foulness</s> the vessel rolls about a good deal</s> do you feel ill</s>  the boy laughed</s>  this is nothing</s> no i feel hungry but that is all</s> if the wind holds as it is we shall not have it rougher than this for weshall steer more and more north and as we always keep inside the sands theland will shelter us</s>  the shortest passage is straight ahead but wegenerally go through a channel between two sands into the wallet whichlies between the sands and the essex shore</s>  there are not many shipmasterswho will come down the river below sheerness at night and even our masterwould not try it with a falling tide but even if one does touch when thetide is rising one soon gets off again</s>  she wont roll about so much whenwe get inside the sands and besides i heard the master say that hethought the wind would fall lighter as the sun got up</s> i should like it to keep on just as it is ulf said</s>  i do not want it toblow so hard that we must go into port and i dont want it to blow solight that we shall go slowly</s> what are you in such a hurry for</s>  the boy asked</s> there are some people my master knows who have gone up in a ship thatstarted yesterday morning and my master wants to be there before them</s> you need not be afraid he is sure to be there first</s>  like enough we havepassed them already</s>  the wind was not so strong yesterday as it was in thenight and i expect they had to anchor when the tide turned</s>  if they have amaster who knows the sands well they may have gone on when the tide turnedagain but it was likely they would anchor before they got down tosheerness</s>  if they did we passed them three or four hours ago</s>  but anyhowyou are sure to be in first</s>  we often beat vessels that started with us bya week</s>  most of them go outside all the sands when it is fine weather butwe always keep inside and it makes a great difference for the tides donot run so strong and even with a light wind we can make way against themwhile those outside have to anchor</s> i cant make out how you can find your way in the dark</s> if it is a thick night and the weather is bad we anchor but when it isclear enough to see the stars or if the wind is steady so as to give usour direction we go on</s>  there is a man always standing at the side with aleadline and that tells us the depth of water which is quite guideenough for the master</s>  of course we never sail in rough weather for if wewent on the sand then we should soon go to pieces but if it is fine whenwe stick fast which is very seldom we put out the anchor and lower thesail and go to sleep until the tide floats us again</s>  come up into thetop you can see a great deal farther from there than you can from thedeck</s> ulf found no difficulty in mounting to the top although he was much longerthan his companion in getting up</s>  there were several sail following themand ulf was surprised at the knowledge his companion showed of vessels thatappeared to him almost precisely similar</s> the one nearest to us is the alfred he said</s>  i know her by that patchon her sail</s>  she trades with harwich</s>  those two smaller craft behind arebound i should say for colchester or maldon</s>  that craft two miles aheadof us is a foreigner</s>  you can see her sail has a longer yard than theothers and the sail is narrower at the bottom than it is at the top</s>  thosetwo or three small craft you see more inshore have passed through thechannel we shall follow into the wallet the farthest one is going on toharwich the others into the rivers</s>  there is a craft about our own sizehull down close by the land</s>  she may be going to harwich or may be goingon north</s>  she looks to me like a foreigner</s>  if so she has come last fromlondon</s>  french and flemish ships do not come within fifty miles of this</s> and now i must go down</s>  we do the cooking and breakfast must be ready inhalf an hour or the master will be storming at us</s> the wind held steadily from the southwest and the vessel ran along nearthe shore in smooth water</s>  the armourer had been ill the first night buthe came on deck soon after breakfast and when once the vessel was past themouth of harwich bay and was close inland he soon recovered</s>  on themorning of the fourth day after leaving port she entered the mouth of thehumber and by nine oclock arrived at hull</s>  landing at once the armourerfound a small vessel on the point of starting for york and in half an hourfrom the time of weighing anchor the tide turned and they ran rapidlyalong helped by the flood</s> at what time will you reach york</s>  the armourer asked the master</s> by daylight tomorrow</s>  we shall sail on until the flood is spent and thenanchor and go on again as soon as the ebb has done</s> how far will you be from york when you anchor</s> we shall most likely get to selby some fourteen miles away by the roadthough farther by the turns of the river</s> could you put us ashore there for we are anxious to reach the city assoon as possible</s> oh yes</s>  i will put you ashore in the boat either there or wherever elsewe may bring up</s> they were three miles short of selby when the ebb began to come down andthe anchor was dropped</s>  the armourer and ulf were at once landed andshouldering their bundles they set out at a brisk pace and passed throughselby at four oclock</s>  no questions were asked them</s>  there was but smalldifference of dress between the people of the various parts of england andit was no unusual sight to see traders and others passing along the road ontheir way to the northern capital</s> i am right glad to be on firm land again ulred said for althoughafter the first night matters have been better than i expected there wasalways a movement that seemed to make my head swim</s> i liked it master ulf said and if it were not that i am going to bean armourer i would gladly be a sailor</s> you might not have said so if you had seen bad weather and moreover itis one thing to be a passenger with nought to do but to amuse yourself andanother to be always hauling at ropes and washing down decks as a sailor</s>  iam glad night is coming on for i feel strange in this country i knownothing of and in the dark one place is like another</s> i would much rather walk along this road in the dark ulf laughed thanalong some of the streets of london where one may step any moment into adeep hole or stumble into a heap of refuse</s> at any rate in the dark no one can see we are strangers ulf and thoughi should not think there would be robbers on the road so near to yorkthese danes are rough folk and i want to meet none of them</s>  one man oreven two i in no ways fear but when it comes to half a dozen even thebest swordplayer may wish himself out of it</s> they met however but one or two men on the road and beyond exchangingthe usual salutation nothing was said but ulred was well pleased whenabout seven oclock they entered the streets of york</s> they had already learned that the royal marriage had taken place on theprevious day and that the king was expected to remain in york two dayslonger before journeying south</s>  there was a banquet being held at thearchbishops palace where the king was lodged and on arriving there theyfound that it would at present be impossible to get at wulf as supper hadjust been served</s>  a small bribe however was sufficient to induce one ofthe bishops servants to take the message to osgod who would be stationednear his masters chair that his father was at the entrance and prayed himto come out to him as soon as possible</s>  a few minutes later the tall saxoncame out with an expression of utter bewilderment on his face</s> is it really you father in flesh and blood</s>  he exclaimed as his eyesfell on ulred</s> i have never been taken for a ghost osgod and if i were to give thee abuffet methinks you would have no doubt upon the matter</s> but what brings you here father</s>  if they had told me that the great abbeytower stood without i could not be more surprised</s> do you not see that i have brought ulf with me osgod</s>  if your head werenot so thick you would guess at once that i have come about the businesswith which he was charged</s> osgod looked relieved</s>  that his father should be in york had seemed to himso strange and outrageous that he had first doubted his own eyes and thenhis fathers sanity</s>  now for the first time the object of his comingflashed upon him</s> is there danger father</s> methinks there is great danger</s>  but the story is a long one</s> then i cannot wait to hear it now for i must needs return to wulf</s>  iwhispered in his ear that i must leave for a moment but that i should beback directly</s> then just whisper to him again osgod that i have urgent need for speechwith him</s>  i suppose beorn has not arrived</s> beorn</s>  osgod repeated vaguely</s> the thane of fareham the armourer said sharply</s>  are your witswoolgathering altogether</s> no he is not here nor has wulf said a word of his coming as heassuredly would have done had he expected him</s> well when i tell you that he is riding from london while i have comethence by sea you may suppose that we thought the matter urgent</s> i will tell wulf at once father but i am sure that he cannot come outfor an hour yet</s> the matter will keep that while</s>  i will go and look for a lodging for usand get something to eat for we have walked some seventeen miles and mylegs are not so accustomed to exercise as my arms</s>  in an hour we will behere again</s> ulred and his apprentice had returned to the gate of the bishops palacebut a few minutes when wulf came out followed by osgod</s>  your message mustbe an important one indeed ulred to cause you to leave the forge and toundertake so long a voyage</s>  and you say beorn is riding hither on the sameerrand</s> he is</s>  it is a sort of race between us and it seems that we have won</s> let us step aside from here wulf said</s>  there are too many gatheredabout to stare at the guests as they come and go for us to talk unobserved</s>
the cathedral yard is close by and there will be no fear of eavesdroppersthere</s> it is ulfs story the armourer said when they reached the shadow of thecathedral</s>  it is to him that the matter was committed and though he wasforced to take me into his confidence the merit of following up thematter if merit there be is his</s> ulf accordingly related the story of his watching the discovery he hadmade by the river and how walter fitzurse had been afterwards seen toembark and had not returned</s>  ulred then stated how he had discovered theship from which the boat had come and had seen the norman go on board andhow when he learned that the ship had sailed he had after seeing beorntaken passage in another vessel</s>  we have come up fast he said and theopinion of the master was that we have gained a full day on any craft thatstarted that morning</s>  of course we know not that the villains have comehither they may have returned to france they may have gone up some of theother rivers in order to take post on the road the king will follow on hisway south</s>  but at any rate we felt it right that you should know thatfitzurse with those with whom he has been holding secret communicationhave left london</s> you have done rightly indeed ulred and in the kings name and for myselfi thank you heartily</s>  of course we are still without any proof thatfitzurse is conspiring against the kings life</s>  it was unfortunate indeedthat ulf did not understand the first conversation he heard but i ought tohave foreseen that it was likely that any talk fitzurse might have withothers would be in norman</s>  i cannot think now how i could have overlookedsuch a probability</s>  of course in the years that he has been over here hehas learnt to speak our language but it would be with normans he woulddeal in the matter of which we suspect him</s>  i will give myself the night tothink over the matter before i decide what steps we had better take</s>  insidethe bishops palace at any rate the king is safe and as you say it isnot likely that the normans can be here for a day at least</s>  if their shipis a french one the master will be ignorant of the dangers of the coastand instead of threading his way through the channels of the sands as yourmaster did will have held his course far outside them</s>  i would we knew howmany men are engaged in the matter</s> as to that we have no clue the armourer said</s>  there was the man of hisown rank and the other two who met him on the bank but whether these wereall or whether there were a score of others on board the ship i know not</s> certainly none showed themselves on the deck while i was watching them</s>  butthis proves nothing</s>  they would naturally be kept in concealment for hadthere been an unusual number of men on board inquiries would have beenmade as to whom they were and their business</s> i will meet you here at seven tomorrow morning ulred and we shall thenhave time to talk the matter over more fully</s> chapter xvii</s> an attempt at assassination</s> when wulf met the armourer next morning in the cathedral close he wasaccompanied by beorn who said laughing to the latter you have beatenme fairly friend ulred and it is well that i had no wager with you on therace</s>  but it was not by much for i rode in here as the bells were chimingeleven</s>  i was glad to hear from wulf when i roused him up that he hadlearnt all the news from you for indeed i was sore weary and was rightpleased to wrap myself in my cloak and go straight to sleep instead ofhaving to sit up for an hour expounding my story</s> we have resolved in the first place ulred to say nought of this matterto the king began wulf</s>  he will have enough to occupy all his thoughtsin the affairs of the kingdom and in the second place his nature is soopen that he will refuse to believe in such villainy unless upon strongproof and of actual proof we have none</s>  beorns appearance here willexcite no surprise</s>  he will say that having nought in particular to occupyhim he had ridden north to be at the wedding and finding that he was toolate would at any rate ride back with the king</s>  with him and me and osgodever on the watch methinks there will be little fear of a surprise and itis by surprise only that they can succeed for harold himself is a matchfor any four or five ordinary men if he has but time to draw his sword</s>  iwill however on some excuse have half a score of harolds housecarlsplaced under my orders and sleeping or waking the king shall never be amoment unguarded</s> i should not think it is likely that fitzurse will have more than five orsix men associated with him in such an enterprise</s>  he would not take moreinto his confidence than he could help and six would suffice as well as ascore for a surprise and that number could travel in disguise withoutexciting attention while twenty would assuredly do so therefore i feelsure that we shall not have to deal with more than six including the twoleaders</s>  ulf do you station yourself at the riverbank and mark anyvessels arriving</s>  if the men come hither they will probably do as you didleave their ship at hull and come up by a local trader</s>  they would thusavoid all questions they might be asked if passing through the country onfoot</s> and what is there for me to do my lord wulf</s>  the armourer said</s> frankly i have gone so far in this matter that i would fain see itthrough</s> of course we reckon upon you ulred</s>  i have been talking it over withbeorn and it seemed to us that the best thing will be for you to ride withosgod</s>  you can either make some slight change in your clothes and ride as aman of mine or you can ride as osgods father who having come up here onmatters connected with your business have obtained permission to ride inmy train with him</s>  i will see that you have that permission</s> i care not how i go so that i can be at hand if there is a blow to bestruck for the king</s> then in that case ulred it were best you went as my man for you wouldthen have the entry of the houses where the king will stop and can aid usin keeping guard</s> that will do well for me ulred replied</s>  ulf had best journey back as hecame</s>  he might go by ship after the king has left here</s> no he shall travel with us</s>  i will see the chamberlain who has charge ofthe arrangements of the journey and will get leave for him to ride in thewaggons with the servants</s> during the three days before the king left york ulf kept a vigilant watchover the boats that came up the river but he could see nothing of the menhe was searching for</s>  wulf had bought a horse for the armourer and whenthey started the latter took his place by osgods side while ulf wasseated in one of the waggons</s>  the king rode with bishop wulfstan next tothem rode the four thanes who had accompanied them through their journeyand next to these wulf and beorn came on together</s>  behind came the queenslitter with a guard of housecarls the main body of whom rode just behindwhile the waggons and servants brought up the rear</s> we need not trouble ourselves on the march beorn</s>  it is not while theking rides with so strong a following that the blow will be struck</s> i see not when they can ever get a chance beorn said</s>  the king willstop always at religious houses and they will scarcely storm a convent toget at him</s> they would not attempt to storm it beorn but they might enter itsecretly</s>  but for my own part i think the most dangerous time is when hemounts or dismounts</s>  there is always a crowd assembled to see him and twoor three reckless men might rush forward and stab him</s> it would be at the cost of their own lives beorn objected</s> it might be but they would reckon much on the confusion that wouldfollow and might think so to get away</s>  they would probably have horsessomewhere close at hand and might ride for the port where they had lefttheir ship</s>  it is a great stake they are playing for and doubtless theyare desperate men though they would know the danger they might calculatethat some at least would escape to claim the reward</s>  then again theymight manage to mingle with the servitors at one of the places where westop</s>  this would not be difficult for many beside the usual establishmentwould be hired to aid in the preparations for the reception of the king</s> that might be their safest plan for were he stabbed suddenly at a meal theassassins might very well escape in the confusion</s> the first night they slept at a monastery at the village of bautre</s>  theestablishment was but a small one and could entertain only the king andqueen with the thanes and their personal attendants</s>  the rest of the trainwere lodged in the village</s>  although they had little fear that an attackwould be ventured in so quiet a village where the presence of strangerswould at once attract attention wulf beorn and osgod kept watch in turnsall night in the corridor</s>  the night passed without cause of alarm and thenext day they rode to nottingham where they were lodged in the bishopspalace</s>  beorn and wulf agreed that this was the place where there was thegreatest likelihood of an attack being made on harolds life</s>  the shipmight have sailed up the river and landed her passengers a few miles fromthe town where among the number of country people who would flock in toobtain sight of the king no one would think of questioning strangers</s>  thearmourer and ulf were charged to wander about the streets and to closelyscan every face</s>  wulf had with some difficulty obtained from harold thecommand of twelve of the soldiers</s> i have my reasons my lord king though i would rather not state them</s>  iwould remind you that i have shown that it is not my habit to take alarmlightly</s>  your brother gurth laughed at me when i begged to watch over hiscamp with my housecarls and i saved him from a sudden attack by the welshthereby</s> then you think that there is danger of an attack upon me wulf</s> i said not so my lord</s>  i have only begged you to appoint twelve of yourmen to obey my orders solely during your journey to london</s> you shall do as you like wulf the king said at last</s>  you have provedyourself brave as well as prudent before now and are not given to vainfears therefore do as you please but let me know nought about it</s>  i shallhave to receive the visits of all the thanes of the neighbourhood when ireach nottingham and the same in other towns</s>  there will be many personscoming in with petitions for the redress of grievances and i would nothave my thoughts disturbed by other matters</s> you shall know nought about it my lord wulf said</s>  it is like enoughthat nothing will come of the matter and none will be more glad thanmyself to find that i am mistaken</s> orders accordingly had been given to the officer of the kings guard tohand over twelve of his men to wulf and the latter had begged him tochoose twelve of his most intelligent men for this service</s>  as soon as theyreached nottingham wulf took his small command aside</s> you have been chosen he said for a special duty</s>  i have learned thatthere are disaffected men who may possibly make an attempt on the kingslife</s>  you are to say no word of what i tell you to anyone</s>  meet me over bythat wall half an hour after sunset</s>  gather quietly one by one so as toattract no attention</s>  you will be posted round the palace to keep watchand

themselves</s>  the king will remainhere two days and watch must be kept over his safety night and day</s> as soon as their apartments were assigned to the different guests wulf wentoutside and examined the windows of the rooms to be occupied by the king</s> they were on the first floor and looked into a garden surrounded by a highwall</s> at any rate there is little fear of a successful surprise from thisside wulf said to beorn who was with him</s>  it would need a ladder toscale the wall this would have to be pulled up for them to descend intothe garden and then carried across to mount to the window</s>  if we postulred with two men here and let four others lie down near to change guardevery two hours it will be ample for on an alarm being given the normanshowever numerous will see that their attempt must fail</s>  we can thereforesend the other six to bed after supper is over for we cannot suppose thatthey would be so daring as to force their way into the palace at any otherpoint</s> as soon as it was dark ulred and six of the soldiers were placed in thegarden the others were directed to hold themselves in readiness to taketheir post in the banquetinghall</s>  just before the bell sounded for supperwulf was told that a boy desired to speak to him at the gate</s>  he hurriedout and as he expected saw ulf waiting there</s> what news ulfhast seen walter fitzurse</s> i have not seen him my lord but i am sure that i heard him speak</s>  therewas a great crowd in the square after the king had entered and among thoseround me i heard one man speak to another in a foreign tongue and thevoice was assuredly that of walter fitzurse</s>  it was but two or three wordshe said but having listened to him for wellnigh half an hour that nightby the river i am certain i was not mistaken in the voice</s>  close beside mewere two cowled monks and i believe that it was one of them who spoke</s>  ilooked round at the faces of the other men standing near but they allseemed honest countrymen or town folk</s>  i should have followed the monks tosee where they went but at that moment there was a rush among the crowd tosee some mummers who had just commenced their antics and i was swept alongby it and though i have been searching ever since and have so stared upinto the cowls of monks that i have been cursed as an insolent boy manytimes i have not seen our man</s> thanks ulf</s>  it is something to have learned that he is here</s>  as to hisdisguise he may by this time have changed it</s>  still i will be on myguard and will take care that no cowled monk approaches too closely to theking</s>  take your place here at the gate and watch all who come in and outand if you see aught suspicious send in a soldier whom i will place byyour side to fetch me out</s> one of the men was accordingly placed with the boy with orders to come towulf whether at the table or in the kings room the moment ulf told himto do so</s>  when the others went into the banquet wulf posted two men justoutside the door and placed the other three back against the wall nearestto the kings chair</s>  here standing against the arras they were concealedfrom the sight of the guests by the crowd of servitors passing to and fro</s> stand with your hands on your daggers wulf said to them and watchevery man who approaches the king no matter of what degree he may appear</s> be ready to spring forward in an instant if you see his hand go to hisdagger</s> the bishop and king sat next to each other in the centre of the table onthe dais on either side were the kings thanes abbots and otherdignitaries of the church and the nobles of the country</s>  wulf and beornhad begged to be excused from supping and permission had been readilygranted by the king as he knew that the bishop would be glad at having twoextra seats at his disposal and they also standing back by the wallclosely scrutinized the movements of the attendants</s>  it was a relief tothem when supper was over and the bishop and his principal guests retiredto a private room</s>  the five soldiers were then told that they would not berequired until morning</s> wulf went out to the gate and learnt from ulf that he had seen no oneenter whom he took for fitzurse</s> he may have gone in by some other entrance my lord he said for thereare three or four ways into the palace</s> we shall be on watch inside ulf</s>  you need stay no longer</s>  be here in themorning at seven</s> after the king and queen had retired to bed and the palace was quiet wulfbeorn and osgod stole from their room and noiselessly passed along thecorridors until they came to the kings apartment and then lay down acrossthe door</s>  they were to keep watch in turns osgod being told to keep thefirst watch and to rouse wulf at midnight</s>  this he did and wulf lay forsome time listening intently</s>  the corridor was faintly lit by two lampsone at either end</s>  wulf had chosen the middle watch because he thoughtthat if any attempt was made it would be soon after midnight as theassassins would wish to have many hours of darkness in which to make theirescape</s>  he knew that beorn was a sound sleeper and could scarcely betrusted to keep awake from midnight until four oclock and that it werebest he himself watched during that time</s> half an hour passed and then he heard a very slight noise</s>  a moment laterfour figures appeared at the end of the corridor</s>  he dared not wake hiscompanions for they might speak or move but he grasped his swordhilthaving drawn the blade in readiness when osgod woke him</s>  the men advancedstealthily and as they approached he saw they had drawn swords in theirhands</s>  they paused a few paces away and in a whisper one saidhere are three fellows

now</s> wulf had gathered his legs under him in readiness to spring to his feet assoon as he saw the figures and as they swiftly advanced he leapt up with ashout and crossed swords with the man

he parried ablow and dealt one in return</s>  it lighted on his opponents shoulder butthe blade shivered in his hand for it had fallen upon mail armourconcealed under the normans garment</s> it is my turn now</s>  fitzurse exclaimed and raised his sword to strike asweeping blow at wulfs head but before it could fall the latter leaptforward and caught the uplifted wrist the impetus of the spring throwinghis opponent backwards while wulf fell heavily upon him and for a momentthey rolled over and over</s>  but wulf was by far the most powerful andspeedily got the upper hand</s>  he had not noticed that his opponent whileholding his sword in his right hand had his dagger already drawn in hisleft</s>  the sword had flown from fitzurses hand as he fell and wulfbelieving him to be powerless glanced round to see how the fray went withthe others when the norman stabbed him deeply in the side</s>  before he couldrepeat the blow wulf snatched his own dagger from his girdle and buried itin

flying opponent downthe corridor and harold sword in hand had just rushed from his chamber</s> wulf saw no more but fell over insensible by the side of his adversary</s> what is all this</s>  harold shouted as he turned to osgod the only figurestanding raising his sword as he spoke for in the dim light he did notrecognize him</s> it means my lord that there has been an attempt on your life</s>  i amosgod wulfs man</s>  i fear my brave young master is killed</s>  and he droppedon his knees by wulfs side</s>  by this time doors were opening all along thecorridor and the kings thanes and other

fearthat the brave thane of steyning is killed</s> the alarm spread fast and the palace so lately hushed and silent was nowin an uproar while the bishop with many other ecclesiastics withservants

and bent over wulfs body</s> is he dead</s> his heart beats but feebly my lord osgod replied</s> where is he hurt</s> there is a great patch of blood here on his right side just over the hip</s> i see no other sign of a wound</s> we will carry him into my chamber the king said</s>  but no i forgot thequeen is there</s>  we will take him into the room opposite it matters notwhose it is</s>  now osgod aid me to lift him gently</s>  bishop i pray you sendfor the leeches most skilled in the treatment of sword wounds in the city</s> then he and osgod carried wulf into the chamber opposite his own and laidhim on a pallet</s> now see to the staunching of the flow of blood till the leeches arrive</s>  imust inquire into this matter</s>  who knows aught about it</s>  he asked as hewent out into the corridor</s> i do my lord king beorn replied as he pushed his way through thethrong</s>  it was a plot to take your life</s>  wulf his man osgod and myselfhad no certain knowledge of it but

what are these men good beorn</s> they are i believe normans but i know naught for certain beyond thefact that the leader he with whom wulf was engaged is walter fitzursewho was a page of the bishop

friends</s>  let us be fair and just as itbecomes englishmen</s>  there are villains of all nations and it is notbecause four caitiffs have thought to do a good service to their duke bygetting rid of

knightly blood buthas died in a most unknightly business</s>  wulfs dagger is still in histhroat</s>  let us see if we know anything of the others</s> i think that you will find them all strangers my lord beorn said</s>  ibelieve they came from beyond the sea to do this deed</s> the man whom wulf had first slain was evidently by his dress a person ofsome rank the other was of inferior station as was also as it was foundthe man beorn had killed</s> now my lord bishop the king said calmly we have a right next to askyou how these men came to be in your palace</s>  know you aught of them</s> i know nothing of them the bishop replied</s>  so far as i am aware i havenever seen any of their faces before and assuredly they were not here withmy cognizance</s>  i will at once question all my people shrewdly and woe beto him who has admitted strangers here unknown to me at the time when youwere beneath my roof</s> and have this house searched from basement to roof bishop</s>  it may be thatthere are others in hiding</s> with your permission my lord said beorn i will at once take your menof whom we have posted six under your window and will call up some moreand search the town</s>  it is likely that there are others without with horsesheld in readiness for these assassins to escape</s> do so beorn</s>  it will be well if we can catch some at least so that wecan get to the bottom of this matter</s> the bishop at once ordered his armed retainers to accompany beorn and thenproceeded to interrogate his officials and the domestics and to see thatthe latter made a complete search of the palace</s>  all denied any knowledgeof strangers having entered and the search revealed nothing but fourmonks gowns and hoods found wrapped up in a bundle in a small roomdownstairs</s>  further questions had been then put</s>  some of the domesticsremembered that four monks had entered the palace late in the evening andone of the under chamberlains said that he had seen them and they had toldhim that they had just arrived from flanders and craved permission tosleep in the palace for the night as they were going on to peterborough inthe morning</s>  he had told them that this was impossible as he could give nopermission without the leave of the bishop who was at present with theking and could not be disturbed and that moreover every room in thepalace was occupied</s>  he had given them the address of a citizen who wouldhe was sure take them in</s>  they had thanked him and said that they would gothere but doubtless instead of doing so they had slipped aside and hadhidden themselves in the room where their gowns were found</s>  it was one usedonly for the storage of garments for poor travellers who came along and noone was likely to enter it on such an evening</s> this discovery was a great relief to the bishop and all within the palaceas it showed that they were not there with the connivance of any of theprelates people</s>  before the matter was fully unravelled beorn returned</s> they had in a quiet spot a short distance from the palace come upon two menwith six horses</s>  before they could run up and seize them the two men hadleapt up into the saddles and galloped furiously away</s>  unfortunately theother four horses had followed and immediate pursuit was thereforeimpossible</s>  the housecarls had run to the spot where their horses werestabled and had gone off in pursuit but beorn feared that the men wouldhave far too great a start to be overtaken</s>  one of the officers had riddenwith the housecarls and beorn had told him to keep by the riverbank asthe men would assuredly make for a ship that was lying somewhere down theriver though whether at a distance of two miles or of twenty he knew not</s> long before beorns return wulfs wound

than it did last night osgod says that he has not moved oropened his eyes but they say that this is not a bad sign and that it maybe anxiety has brought on an exhaustion for his breathing is more

that heshould die</s>  you have of a surety saved my life among you beorn you andhis stout manatarms and the worthy armourer and that shrewd apprentice ofhis for had they entered my chamber and taken

that walter fitzurse was back in london i should have given thematter no further thought than that it was one norman the more</s>  it was ashe told me some words that baron de burg said when he saw him over innormandy the other day that first set him thinking</s>  then he could notunderstand why fitzurse should return to london at this time when normansare not overwelcome there and this caused him to have some sort ofsuspicion as to his reasons for undertaking such a journey and determinedhim to set a watch on the fellows movements</s>  had it been any other thanwulf who had so acted i should have laughed at his suspicions</s>  but he is asa brother to me and knowing how sharp are his wits i am always wellcontent to follow him without question</s>  i first heard of the matter afterthe discovery that the norman was having secret meetings with some of hiscountrymen who were concealed on board a ship and i at once felt sure thatwulf had not been running on a false trail and so did the little i couldto aid those who had the matter in hand</s> you have done well beorn though as you say it is doubtless wulf to whomthe chief credit is due</s>  i regretted at first that the

and show myself to the people an hour since forthey assembled in a great crowd clamouring to see me so that they mightknow i was safe</s>  i told them that while i thanked them for their loyalcare there was nought to be alarmed about</s>  it was true that there had beenan attempt on my life by four men of whom the leader had a private grudgeagainst me for a disservice i did him some years ago but that all had beenkilled by my guards without even penetrating my chamber and that i had runno sort of personal risk nor had i any reason whatever to suppose that themalefactors had accomplices

hands</s> it is all well master he said</s>  we finished them all off and no harmhas happened to the king</s>  you have been hurt but i hope you will soon bebetter</s>  the leeches say that you are not to talk and you had best sleep asmuch as you can</s>  they have got some stuff for you to drink here do youlie still and i will pour it between your lips</s> a look of intelligence came into wulfs eyes as osgod spoke he smiledfaintly and murmured thank god the king is safe</s>  he swallowed a fewspoonfuls of the potion osgod held to his lips and then closing his eyeshis regular breathing soon

take one of his daughters to wifeand in the complaints that he addressed to all christendom against haroldthe breach of his promise in this respect was placed far more prominentlythan his failure to carry out his oath to be the dukes man</s>  it must havebeen evident indeed to all that it was beyond the power of the english kingto keep this oath obtained from him by force and treachery</s>  he had beenelected by the voice of the english people and had no more power than themeanest of his subjects to hand the crown they had bestowed to another</s> the breach of this oath however served to obtain all the aid that thechurch could give to william</s>  harold was solemnly excommunicated and thestruggle for which the duke was preparing thereupon assumed the characterof a sacred war</s>  in england itself the bull of excommunication had noeffect whatever</s>  the great bulk of bishops and clergy were englishmen andthought far more of their king than of any foreign prince or prelate</s>  eventhe bishops and abbots of norman blood disregarded the commination andremained staunch to harold</s>  he had been a generous patron to the churchhad maintained them in all the privileges and dignities that edward hadbestowed upon them and possessed the love of the whole english peopletherefore in spite of bann and interdict the churches remained openservices were held as usual and people were married and buried as if thepapal bull had never been issued</s> but it was not so on the continent</s>  the norman barons as a body had atfirst refused to support the duke in an invasion of england but asindividuals they had been brought round to join in williams project andto give far more aid in ships and men than they were bound to do by theirfeudal engagements</s>  having accomplished this william issued an invitationto all adventurous spirits in europe to join him in his crusade against theexcommunicated king of england promising that all should share alike inthe plunder of england and in the division of its land</s>  the bait was atempting one</s>  some joined the enterprise merely for the sake of gainingglory under the banner of one who was regarded as the greatest militaryleader in europe others were influenced by love of gain while as in thecrusades numbers joined to obtain absolution for past misdeeds by takingpart in an enterprise blessed by the pope</s>  thus the force which william wascollecting greatly exceeded that which the resources of normandy alonecould have set on foot</s> among the first to hurry to the court of william as soon as haroldsaccession to the throne was known was tostig in whose mind the refusal ofharold to embark in a civil war for his sake and to force him upon thepeople of northumbria in spite of their detestation of him was an injurynot to be forgiven</s>  the fact that tostig was ready thus to sacrificeengland to his own private quarrel showed a baseness and recklessness thatcould hardly be expected from his early career</s>  william naturally acceptedthe alliance received tostigs oath of allegiance and aided him infitting out a number of ships manned by norman and flemish adventurers</s> evading the watch kept by the english fleet they crossed the sea landedand plundered and ravaged a considerable extent of country and thenretired tostig being enraged that william of normandy was unwilling tosend an expedition to act in concert with him until the whole of his planswere prepared and his great army ready for sea</s> normandy indeed had been converted into a vast camp</s>  in every port greatnumbers of workmen laboured night and day building ships for normandy hadceased to be a naval power and its shipping was utterly insufficient tocarry the great army across</s>  tostig impatient and hasty thought no moreof the oath of allegiance that he had sworn to william</s>  driven fromyorkshire by the forces of the northern earls he sailed to scotland wherehe was welcomed by king malcolm both as a sworn brother and as the enemyof england</s>  from scotland he entered into negotiations with harold hardradaof norway</s>  this warlike monarch was in a fit mood to listen to hisadvances he had for years been engaged in a struggle with denmark whichhe had ineffectually attempted to conquer and had at last been forced toconclude a treaty of peace with sweyn its king</s> tostig had already endeavoured by personal persuasions to induce sweyn torevive his claim to the crown of england and to undertake its conquestbut he altogether declined to undertake so dangerous and difficult anenterprise and tostig had then turned to harold of norway</s>  whether hisinterview with him was before he went to scotland or whether he went thenceto norway is a point on which historians differ</s>  some deny that anyinterview took place but the balance of probability lies strongly infavour of an early interview at which harold entered heartily intotostigs plans and began at once to make preparations for the enterprise</s> it was certain that an invading force from norway would land innorthumbria and harold although he might not be able to rely greatly uponthe assistance of the northern earls as against the normans knew that theywould do their best to defeat an expedition landing on their own shoresespecially when tostig was a sharer in the invasion</s>  his own thoughts werewholly bent upon repelling the mighty expedition gathering in normandy andfor this purpose by immense efforts he collected the greatest army andfleet that had ever been got together in england</s>  an incessant watch waskept up along the coast where the normans might be expected to land whilethe fleet cruised for months between the thames and the isle of wightprepared to give battle to the invaders</s> but the conditions of service in england were such that it was impossibleto keep a great force on foot for an indefinite time</s>  the housecarls werethe only regular portion of the army the great bulk of the force both landand sea consisting of the levies or militia whose term of service wasvery limited</s>  it says much for the influence of harold that he was ablefor four months to keep his army and navy together</s>  had the foe appearedsoldiers and sailors would have done their duty but the long term ofinaction the weary waiting for a foe that never came was too much andwhen september arrived and the harvest was ready to be gathered it wasimpossible even for him to keep the men longer together</s>  the armydisbanded the levies went to their homes and the ships of the fleetsailed away to the ports to which they belonged</s>  all the efforts andanxieties of harold all his lavish expenditure in feeding and providingfor so great a number of men had been thrown away</s>  england lay for a timeabsolutely defenceless against the coming storm</s> it was not until august that wulf had completely recovered his strengthand was able to join the army</s> this is not a time harold said to him on the day he arrived at the campfor the granting of dignities or the bestowal of grants</s>  but if we aresuccessful and i remain king of england the services you have rendered meat the risk of your life wulf shall be worthily rewarded</s> i need no reward wulf replied</s>  my estates are sufficient for all myneeds and i desire neither land nor dignity being more than content thati have been enabled to render a service to you and to england</s> wulf was however at once appointed as commander of the whole of thehousecarls supplied by the thanes of the south coast of sussex</s>  none ofthese bodies were equal in strength to his own carefully preparedcontingent few of the thanes having kept up more than fifteen or twentymen constantly under arms and these only for the past few months inconsequence of harolds exhortations</s>  altogether the force amounted toabout four hundred men</s>  each party had its own subofficer and wulf didhis best to weld them into one body</s>  when the army broke up he returnedwith the king to westminster</s>  the day after he arrived there a man met himas he issued from the palace and handed him a letter</s>  it contained but thewordsi would fain see you</s>  if you will follow the bearer he will bring youto me</s>  say naught to any one of this message</s>  edith</s> is the distance far</s>  he asked the man</s> it is to croydon my lord</s>  i have ridden here on horseback</s> wulf at once ordered his horse to be brought to him</s> will you be back tonight my lord osgod asked as he mounted in casethe king should wish to see you</s> i shall not be back till late possibly not until tomorrow i do not tellyou where i am going in order that if you are asked you may be

from the village ofcroydon</s>  edith met him at the doorway</s> i thank you wulf for answering my request so speedily</s>  there is muchthat i would ask you about my lord</s>  i hear of him only by general reportfor although from time to time i send him messages i give him noopportunity for writing to me and i know that he has respected my wishesand has caused no search to be made for me</s> harold sometimes speaks to me of you lady and has in no way forgottenyou</s>  he did charge me to find out if i could the place of your abode notthat he would seek an interview with you but should there be need hemight be able to send a message</s>  by this time they were seated in the roomwhere edith spent the greater part of her time</s> it is better that we should not meet she said earnestly</s>  his missionis to work and to fight for england mine to remain apart from all men andto spend my time in prayers for him</s>  i know that he places great confidencein you as indeed he well may for i heard how you had saved his life wellnigh at the expense of your own</s>  is he happy with his new queen</s> his thoughts at present lady are altogether turned to public affairsand it is well perhaps that it should be so</s>  i do not think that hereceives much sympathy from the queen who cares more i should say forher brothers the northern earls than for her husband</s> it is scarce a wonder that it should be so edith replied though itseems strange to me that any woman could live with harold without lovinghim with all her heart</s>  and yet she may well feel that she like haroldhas been sacrificed</s>  there was no shadow of love between them before theirmarriage in fact she may even have hated him for it was he who broughtruin and death upon her husband the welsh king</s>  she must know that heonly married her in order to gain the firm alliance of her brothers andthat her hand was given by them to harold without any reference to herfeelings</s>  i would that the king were happy even though it were withanother</s>  but it was not for his happiness that i left him but that englandmight be one</s>  is it true that the army is broken up and the fleetscattered</s> it is true lady</s>  save for three or four thousand housecarls there is notan armed man in readiness to defend england</s> it must be a terrible trial to him</s> it is my lady</s>  he returned to town yesterday dispirited and cast down atthe failure of the work of months</s> still they will reassemble rapidly she said when the normans reallycome</s> doubtless they will</s>  but the loss of the fleet is greater than that of thearmy for at sea we could have met and almost assuredly have conqueredthem for the normans are no match for our sailors whereas to meet sogreat an army of trained soldiers with hastily assembled levies is tofight under every disadvantage</s> and is the rumour true which says that tostig and harold of norway arealso preparing for an invasion</s> all reports that come to us through denmark are to that effect</s> it is enough to make the stones cry out edith said indignantly that ason of godwin should thus betray england</s>  i never thought it of him</s>  hewas headstrong and passionate yet as a young man he was loved almost asmuch as harold himself nay some loved him more</s>  but it was not on accountof public affairs that i brought you here

ever be prepared for defeat as well as forvictory</s>  so the levies fought well</s> they did my lord</s>  they engaged the norsemen gallantly and wellmuchbetter indeed than i had looked for them to

of his troops</s>  it was the city only that had so treacherouslybehaved and the surrender by no means included the whole province</s>  it wasarranged however by the earls that hostages should be given fornorthumbria at large and they promised that a hundred and fifty of theseshould be handed over at stamford bridge eight miles northeast of thecity</s> here there was a palace of the old northumbrian kings</s>  the spot wasfavourable for the encampment of an army for the country round was fertileand the bridge across the derwent afforded facilities for the collection ofprovisions over

of the surrender of york made no change in harolds plans</s>  he hadcome to give battle to the norsemen whether he did so under the walls ofthe northern capital or elsewhere accordingly he pressed rapidly forward</s> in a few hours the army arrived in sight of york which had it resistedbut a day longer would have been saved the humiliation of the surrenderand treaty</s>  the invaders had all marched to stamford bridge and the peopleopened its gates and received with rejoicing the king whose authority theyhad the day before cast off</s>  beyond a short pause for food there was nodelay</s>  harolds thoughts were on the south and he grudged every hour thatdelayed his return to his post there</s>  the men of the city and thesurvivors of the army defeated at fulford joined the force which

by the river</s>  the greaterportion of their host had crossed the bridge their king tostig and manyof the great chiefs had taken up their abode in the royal palace at aldbyand were preparing to return to york where the king was to hold his courtand formally to assume the government and to proclaim the laws for his newkingdom</s> already the cortege had set out clad not in warlike armour but in courthabiliments when on the long road leading gently down to the river a cloudof dust and the sparkle of arms was seen</s>  there was little room for doubtas to the nature of the arriving

men of the south had thus unexpectedly arrived</s>  tostig at onceproposed a retreat to the ships at riccall so that the whole army might begathered together but harold hardrada strove to marshal his army for thebattle at the same time sending off mounted messengers to summons theparty left at the ships</s>  but while all was in confusion among the main bodyof the invaders on the eastern bank of the river while men were bucklingon their armour and gathering in their ranks the cloud of war rolledrapidly down the descent and with a mighty shout the english vanguard fellupon the norsemen on the western bank</s> valiantly they fought but there was no resisting the solid array of theenglish housecarls or thingmen as they were also called</s>  taken altogetherunprepared and for the most part without their defensive armour thenorsemen could offer no successful resistance to the english host</s>  greatnumbers were killed others were driven headlong across the bridge or weredrowned in the

themiddle of the narrow bridge and barred the way to the english host</s>  but onefoe could attack him at a time and so great was his strength and prowessthat it is said forty englishmen fell under the mighty blows of histwohanded sword and at last he was only overpowered by one who made hisway along beneath the timbers of the bridge and stabbed him with his spearfrom below</s> his gallant stand however had sufficed to give his countrymen time tocomplete their preparations and the shieldwall of the norsemen stretchedacross the gentle ascent from the bridge</s>  with his hands raised aloft as asign that his mission was a peaceful one an english thane with twentymounted horsemen rode across the bridge</s>  he was met by the king tostigand his chiefs</s>  raising his voice the thane

king of norway advanced to the end of the bridge a battlewould have been impossible for the english could never have forced theirway across</s>  but the kings were equally anxious for a battle</s>  harold ofnorway knew as well as the king of england that the host of normandy was onthe point of sailing and it was as essential for him to crush the englisharmy before the normans landed as it was for harold of england to disposeat once of the norse invaders</s>  there were three claimants for the englishcrown and both kings felt the necessity of having their hands free to meetthe normans</s>  harold of norway may well have believed that his host of triedwarriors was capable of disposing of an army that save for its small bodyof regular troops was wholly unused to war therefore he held his arrayimmovable while the english army crossed the bridge and formed up forbattle</s> steadily and firmly the solid line of the housecarls moved up the assentand then as harolds trumpet gave the signal

norsemen</s>  against such terrible weapons wielded by suchpowerful arms helmet and hauberk afforded but a poor defence</s>  casques andthe heads beneath them were cleft like eggshells under the

generally flew well in advance of his fighting line while on theother side the still greater height and strength of the king of norwayrendered him equally conspicuous</s>  at last the obstinate valour of theenglish housecarls prevailed over the resistance of the fierce norsemenand the invading host was driven backward step by step up the ascent untilthe level ground was reached</s> here the battle again raged as fiercely as ever</s>  in vain did harold ofnorway followed by his bravest warriors hurl himself upon the ranks ofthe english his terrible sword carrying death in its path</s>  in vain

affairs of the north</s>  the thanes came in from all northumbria</s>  theywere full of thankfulness at the deliverance that had been wrought forthem and the victor of stamford bridge was far more to them than the kingof england had ever been</s>  all were received with kindness and courtesy andharold felt that at stamford bridge he had conquered not only the host ofnorway but the northern earldoms</s>  on the evening of the fifth day afterthe battle they held a great banquet at york</s>  the feasting was at itsheight when harold was told that a messenger had arrived with urgent newsand the man was at once brought in</s>  he had ridden in two days from thesouth and brought the momentous news that on the third day after thevictory of stamford bridge the norman host had landed in sussex</s> chapter xx</s> the landing of the foe</s> while harold with his army had been anxiously and impatiently watching thesea on the southern coast of england the mixed host of the duke ofnormandy had been no less anxiously awaiting a favourable breeze at theport where the whole of the expedition was gathered</s>  william had howeverone great advantage</s>  while harolds army and navy were composed of leviesbound by feudal obligations to remain but a certain time under arms andeager to return to their harvest operations their wives and familieswilliams was made up to a great extent of seasoned troops and professionalsoldiers gathered not only from his own dominions but from all parts ofeurope</s> these were far more amenable to orders than were the english militia</s> tempted by the thought of the plunder of england they had enlisted underthe dukes banner for the expedition</s>  they had no thought of returninghome and as long as they were well supplied with food the delay instarting mattered comparatively little to them and thus while at lengththe fleet and army of harold scattered to their homes the normans remainedin their camp ready to embark on board the ships as soon as a favourablewind blew</s>  they were kept in good temper by receiving regular pay andprovisions and as all plundering was strictly forbidden the country peoplefreely brought in supplies and for a month the great army was fed withoutdifficulty but as the resources of the country became exhausted the dukegrew more and more anxious to move to another port and taking advantage ofa change of wind to the west he embarked his army and sailed north alongthe coast of normandy to the mouth of the somme and the troops disembarkedand encamped round the town of st</s>  valery</s> here there was another long delay and while harold was marching north tomeet the king of norway the normans were praying for a favourable wind atthe holy shrine at the abbey of st</s>  valery</s>  two days after the host ofharold hardrada had been destroyed the wind suddenly shifted to the south</s> there had on the previous day been a great religious ceremony the holyrelics had been brought by the priests into the camp the whole army hadjoined in a solemn service precious gifts had been offered at the shrineand as the change of wind was naturally ascribed to the influence of thesaint the army was filled with enthusiasm and believed that heaven haddeclared in their favour</s> from morning till night the scene of bustle and preparation went on andwhen darkness fell the whole host had embarked</s>  every ship was ordered tobear a light and a huge lantern was hoisted at the masthead of themora the dukes own ship and orders were issued that all vesselsshould follow the light</s>  the mora however was a quick sailer andwas not like the other vessels deeply laden down with horses and men</s> when daylight broke therefore she had so far outstripped the rest that noother sail was in sight and she anchored until the fleet came up when thevoyage was continued and at nine on the morning of thursday the 28th ofseptember the normans landed on english soil near the village of pevensey</s> the landing was unopposed the housecarls were away north with their kingthe levies were scattered to their homes</s>  to the surprise of the normanswho landed in battle array no armed man was to be seen</s>  parties of mountedmen at once examined the country for miles round but without finding signsof the defending army they expected to meet</s>  on the following morning asmall force was left in the roman fortifications near pevensey to guard theships hauled up on the beach from attack and the duke with his armymarched away along the roman road to hastings where william establishedhis headquarters and resolved to await the approach of the army of england</s> a wooden castle was raised on the height and the country for miles roundwas harried by the norman horse</s>  every house was given to the flames menwere slain women and children taken as slaves and the destruction was socomplete that it seemed as if it had been done with the deliberate purposeof forcing harold to come down and give battle</s> no sooner did harold hear the news that the normans had landed and wereharrying the land than he ordered the hall to be cleared and issued asummons for the assembly of a gemot and in an hour an assemblage of allthe thanes gathered at york was held in the hall that had so shortly beforebeen the scene of peaceful feasting</s>
 harold proclaimed to them the news hehad heard and called upon them to arm and call together their levies forthe defence of england</s>  an enthusiastic reply was given</s>  as the men of thesouth had crushed the invaders of the north so would the men of the northassist to repel the invasion of the south</s>  morcar and edwin promisedsolemnly to lead the forces of northumbria and mercia to

at stamfordbridge should march at daybreak</s>  as soon as the council was over wulfmounted his horse and rode at full speed to helmsley</s>  he had each dayridden over to see osgod who in his anxiety

nightfall i shall beon my way back with every man on the estate a hundred and fifty besidesthe housecarls and two days march will bring us here again</s>  ulf is welli hope</s>  i do not see him</s> he has but carried home some arms i have been mending</s>  we are workingnight and day since the news that the normans had landed came there hasbeen no thought of bed among the armourers and smiths of westminster andlondon</s>  each man works until he can work no longer then throws himselfdown for two or three hours sleep and then wakes up to work again and soit will be till the army has moved south with most of us in its ranks</s> wulf reached steyning soon after daybreak and as soon as the news that hehad arrived went round the tenants flocked in</s>  his coming had beenanxiously expected for the alarm caused by the incursions all over thecountry by the norman horse was intense and although so far none hadcome west of beachy head there was a general feeling that at any momentthey might make their appearance</s>  the news therefore that harold wasmarching south with his army and that all were to share in a pitchedbattle with the invader instead of being slaughtered on their hearthstonescaused a deep feeling of satisfaction</s>  wulf gave orders that every manshould assemble in fighting array at noon and that if later on news camethat the enemy were approaching the houses were to be deserted the stacksfired and driving the cattle before them the women and children shouldcross the hills and take shelter in the great forest beyond</s>  a few of theolder men who were unfit to take part in a long days fighting were to aidthe women in their work</s> the arms of all the men were carefully inspected and the weapons remainingin the armoury served out to those worst provided</s>  at one oclock the forcemarched off wulf riding at the head of the hundred housecarls while thetenants a hundred and fifty strong followed in good order</s>  each mancarried six days provisions</s>  they camped that night in a forest twentymiles from steyning marched thirty miles the next day and early thefollowing morning joined the great array that was gathering on the hillssouth of london</s>  to his great pleasure wulf found that beorn had arrivedthe day before with his levy</s>  they had not met since they had returned fromthe north with harold</s> so you have been up there again wulf and fought at fulford and stamfordbridge</s>  it was very unlucky i was not in london when the army marchednorth but i received no summons and heard nothing of it until the kingwas well on his march</s>  none of the thanes along the south coast weresummoned</s> so i heard beorn</s>  i fancy the king thought that in case of a landing bythe normans the men near the coast would all be wanted to help take thewomen and cattle to places of security</s> no doubt that was the reason beorn said</s>  at any rate i am sorry imissed the fight at stamford bridge</s>  the other seems to have been a badaffair</s> very bad we suffered terribly</s>  so much so indeed that the earls willhave a good excuse for not getting their levies together in time for thebattle with the normans</s> they are false loons beorn said and brothersinlaw as they are ofhis it would have been well had the king after stamford bridge had theirheads smitten off for their traitorous surrender to the norsemen</s> i have no doubt they will hold aloof now beorn until they see howmatters go in the south and if we are worsted they will hasten to maketheir peace with william and to swear to be his liegemen just as theyswore to be liegemen to harold hardrada</s>  but they will find out theirmistake in the end</s>  william has promised to divide england among his needyadventurers if he wins and edwin and morcar will very speedily find thatthey will not in that case be allowed to keep half the country as theirshare</s> it was a great host that was gathered ready for the march south</s>  gurth hadbrought down the fighting men of east anglia the thanes of the west werethere with their tenants the bishop of winchester harolds uncle notonly brought the tenants of the church lands but he himself with twelve ofhis monks had put on armour under their monkish robes</s>  the abbot ofpeterborough headed a contingent from the fen country the men of londonunder the sheriff of the mid saxons were there and prepared to die indefence of the royal standard which it was the special privilege of londonto guard</s>  in the abbey of westminster where harold had received hiscrown and in every church of london mass was celebrated day and nightand was attended by crowds of troops and citizens</s> harold himself snatched a day from the cares of preparation to visitwaltham the abbey that he had founded and in which he had taken so livelyan interest and there earnestly prayed for victory with the vow that didhe conquer in the strife he would regard himself as gods ransomed servantand would throughout his life specially devote himself to his service</s>  aday or two after wulfs arrival in london a messenger came from william ofnormandy calling upon harold to come down from his throne and to becomeas he had sworn to be the dukes man</s>  harold in reply sent back a fullanswer to williams claims</s>  he admitted that edward had promised the crownto william but he said that according to the law of england a man might atany time revoke his will and this edward had done and had named him ashis successor</s>  as to the oath he himself had sworn he maintained that itwas an extorted oath and therefore of no binding force</s>  finally heoffered rich gifts to william if he would depart quietly but added that ifhe was bent on war he would meet him in battle on the coming saturday</s> it is probable that williams insolent message was meant to have the effectof inducing harold to march against him</s>  the norman position was a verystrong one and had been carefully fortified and he hoped that haroldwould attempt to storm it</s>  gurth urged his brother to remain in londonwhile he himself went with the army to battle</s>  a large number of the levieshad as yet not come in and with these should the first battle beunsuccessful another army could be gathered to continue the struggle</s> moreover whether the oath harold had sworn was binding or not he hadsworn and it were better that another who was perfectly free in hisconscience should lead the english to battle</s> then too gurth urged if he himself was slain it would mattercomparatively little while harolds death would jeopardize the wholekingdom</s>  he prayed him therefore to stay in london and to gather anotherand greater force and to lay waste the whole land between london and thecoast so that the normans whether successful or not in their firstbattle would be starved into a departure from the land</s>  the counsel ofgurth was approved of by the thanes but harold rejected it</s>  he declaredthat he would never let his brothers and friends go forth to danger on hisbehalf while he himself drew back from facing it neither could he bringhimself to harm the lands or the goods of any englishman</s> for six days harold remained in london waiting but in vain for the forcesfrom the north to join him and on the thursday morning set out with hisarmy in order to meet the invaders on the day he had named</s>  accounts differvery widely as to the strength of that army</s>  norman writers in order toglorify their own victory speak of it as one of prodigious numbers</s> english writers on the other hand endeavour to explain the defeat byminimizing the number of those who followed harolds standard</s>  doubtlessthe english king knowing the proved valour of his housecarls and freshfrom the crushing defeat inflicted on the norsemen considered the numbersto be sufficient</s>  his military genius was unquestionable and next only towilliam the norman he was regarded as the greatest general in europe</s>  asthere was no occasion for haste so long as the normans remained at hastingshe would not have moved forward with a force he deemed insufficient whenhe knew that in another week its numbers would have been doubled</s> on the day that the king made his last visit to waltham wulf rode over tocroydon in compliance with an entreaty he received from edith</s> when does the army march</s>  she asked anxiously as she entered</s> the day after tomorrow lady</s> and my lord goes with it</s> he does</s>  i myself think that gurths counsel was good and that it werebest for england that he remained at westminster and yet i can understandwell that he himself would feel it a shame did he remain behind</s> i feel sore misgivings edith said bursting into

no relief</s>  i have never feared forhim before</s>  i have always felt sure that whoever died harold would bespared for the sake of england but i have no such feeling now</s>  it seems tome that i sacrificed him and myself in vain when i bade him leave me andmarry the sister of the northern earls</s>  no good has come of it</s>  they arebehaving now as traitors and he has lost his lifes

oxford</s>  you must not think lady that the king has beenunhappy since he came to the throne</s>  he has been so incessantly occupiedwith work that he has had no time for domestic happiness even if it hadbeen within his reach</s>  his thoughts are ever on england and he has nothought of self</s>  labouring ever for the good of his subjects he has hishappiness alike in their love and in the knowledge that he is doing allthat man can for their welfare</s>  if he dies he will die the death not onlyof a soldier but of the noblest king that ever sat on the english throneand at all times he will be enshrined in the hearts of the english peoplewhether normans or englishmen reign over the land</s> that is true and i must take comfort from it wulf but it was not forthis that i sent for you but to ask you where the battle is likely to befought</s> near hastings assuredly wulf replied</s> i shall travel south tomorrow</s>  i have had a message from the king prayingme to see him but that would be too much for me</s>  he is another womanshusband and i dare not meet him it were sin for me to do so but i wouldfain be nearer to the scene of battle so that in a few hours i mightjourney

but even should i notreturn the news will travel swiftly but god forfend that so great a lossshould fall upon england</s> amen edith murmured and yet i fear</s>  thanks wulf for comingperchance we may not meet again</s>  i am thinking of entering a conventprobably that at lewes</s>  the struggle and pain here is wellnigh too greatfor me but in the walls of a cloister i may find peace</s>  if my fears arefulfilled i shall assuredly do this and when i return to the convent ishall leave it no more</s>  my life is over</s>  i have a happy past to look backupon in that am blest and shall be happier than those who have no suchconsolation</s>  moreover i can still be proud of harold and may love him asi might love the memory of a husband who is lost</s>  god bless you wulf andprotect you through the coming battle</s> wulf rode sadly back to the camp</s>  although he had denied it to edith hecould not but admit to himself that the sacrifice that she and harold hadmade had so far been unavailing</s>  it had failed to draw the northern earlscloser to the king</s>  the marriage had been productive of no happiness toharold and the only reward he had gained had been in the sympathy of thepeople who knew well enough that he had sacrificed his love for the goodof his country</s> the army marched rapidly</s>  beorn and wulf rode together and talked over thechances of the coming battle</s> i cannot blame harold for not remaining behind wulf said though itwere certainly more politic for him to have stayed in london</s>  as he couldnot do so i think it would have been well had he bidden gurth remainbehind to gather another army with which to meet the normans should we bedefeated or if he could not spare gurth he might have left leofric behind</s> it is assuredly a mistake

should one fall all mayperish together</s>  one at least ought to remain behind</s>  it matters not howmany of us are killed so that one of godwins sons is left to rally thekingdom</s>  you may be sure that if we are conquered the victors will be inbut poor condition to meet another foe but if there is no one to gather anarmy and unite all england against the normans they will eat us uppiecemeal</s> we must not think of so terrible a thing wulf</s>  it is not like you to lookat the dark side</s>  why when we were in wales and in as bad a plight ascould well be you always made light of danger and managed affairs as ifwe were certain to succeed</s>  why should we be defeated</s>  why should the kingbe killed</s>  he went through the terrible fight at stamford bridge without ascratch</s>  we have seen the normans at work and know that they are not suchterrible fellows and as for their duke i would assuredly rather meet himin battle doughty as he may be than have faced harold hardrada with histwohanded sword</s> i have every hope of winning the day beorn but still i do regret muchthat gurth and leofric are both here</s>  do you remember that in wales weagreed that it was always well to have a way of retreat in case of defeat</s> well i feel that defeat this time will mean not only the defeat of an armybut the ruin of england</s> on friday afternoon the army reached rising ground near the village ofsenlac which harold had beforehand fixed upon as the place where he wouldgive battle to the invaders</s>  kent and sussex he knew well</s>  they had beenthe home of his family and he owned vast estates there</s>  doubtless in thelong weeks of waiting for the coming of the norman fleet he had fixed uponthis spot as one well suited for a battle</s>  it was necessary that theenglish should fight on the defensive</s>  the normans were strong in cavalrywhile the english were unaccustomed to fight on horseback and would havebeen at a grievous disadvantage had they attacked the enemy</s> the hill offered many advantages to a force standing on the defensive</s>  thegreat eastern road passed close to its foot and its possession barred thepassage of the invaders in that direction</s>  the ground between it and thesea was marshy and broken and its occupation by an english force left thenormans no choice but to come out and attack them</s> the sides were steep and the ground rose rapidly in the rear so that thenorman cavalry could not attack from behind</s>  it was indeed a sort ofpeninsula running southward from the main range of hills</s> the moment the troops reached the ground the royal standard was plantedand the men set to work to fell trees and to form a triple palisade alongthe accessible sides of the hills</s>  the force at harolds command must havebeen far nearer to the estimate given of its strength by the englishchroniclers than by the normans for the space occupied was insufficientfor the standing room of such an army as that enumerated by the latterwriters</s> harold relied almost entirely upon the housecarls</s>  the levies might bebrave but they were undisciplined and might easily be thrown intodisorder they would too be impatient under the trial of a long daysbattle</s>  it is even said that he sent away some of the illarmed levies whocame flocking in from the country round eager to revenge the injuriesreceived at the hands of the normans</s>  it was upon the shieldwall thefavourite formation of the english that he relied to win the battle</s>  itwas their national mode of fighting</s>  it was that in which alfred had ledthe saxons to victory over the danes</s>  it was that in which they clashedagainst the shieldwall of norway and shattered it and he might well hopethat the barons of normandy and the adventurers from all parts of europewho fought under williams banner might well try in vain to break it</s> in the evening a messenger arrived from william again bidding haroldresign the kingdom or meet the duke in single combat the crown of englandto be the prize of the victor</s>  harold refused the challenge</s>  he had provedhis personal courage too often for it to be supposed that he declined fromany feeling of cowardice but he knew well that the issue could not be thusdecided</s>  were he to fall the people would still refuse to accept williamas their king were william to fall the host that had gathered for theplunder of england would still give battle</s>  nothing was therefore to begained by the proposed combat</s> chapter xxi</s> hastings</s> the fiction of the norman historians that while the normans passed thenight preceding the battle in prayer the english spent it in feasting iseven more palpably absurd than the many other falsehoods invented for thepurpose of damaging the character of harold</s>  the english army had marchednearly seventy miles in the course of two days and had in additionlaboured incessantly for many hours in erecting the palisades and indigging ditches</s>  we may be sure that after two such days the great mass ofthe army lay down dogtired directly their work was done and slept tillmorning</s>  harold and his thanes had shared in their labours and knowing theterrible work that awaited them in the morning would most surely bedisposed to get as long a sleep as possible to prepare for it</s> but what is most opposed to the norman story is the fact that harold was asincerely and deeply religious man far more so than his rival</s>  the life ofthe one man was in accordance with his professionshe was gentle andmerciful ever ready to forgive his enemies averse to bloodshed and sotrue a friend of the church that the whole of the prelates and clergy setthe interdict of the pope at naught for his sake</s>  the only exception in hisclemency to the conquered was in the case of the welsh and in thisinstance the stern measures he adopted were in the end the most merciful</s> no oaths could bind these marauders and the stern punishment he inflictedwas the means of procuring for the west of england a respite from theirincursions that lasted for three generations</s> william of normandy on the contrary was absolutely merciless in warfare</s> he was not cruel for the sake of cruelty but where he deemed that thepolicy demanded it he was ruthless and spared neither age nor sex</s>  he waslavish to the church but it was rather because he needed and obtained itsaid than from any feeling of real piety</s> in point of ability both civil and military the duke of normandy andharold of england were perhaps about equal in point of nobility ofcharacter there was no comparison between them</s>  we may be sure that thenight before the battle harold prayed as earnestly as he had prayed atwaltham for the aid of heaven</s> wulf and beorn lay down among the thanes after harold sitting with themround a fire had explained his plans for the battle</s>  so calmly andconfidently did he speak and so strong was their position that even thosewho had like wulf doubted the wisdom of an advance until the whole forceof england had assembled now felt something like an assurance of victoryand all lay down to sleep with the belief that the victory at stamfordbridge would be repeated</s> on waking wulf visited his men</s>  they were already astir and he wasastounded at seeing among them the towering figure of osgod</s> why what means this osgod</s>  he exclaimed</s>  did i not order you to restquietly at york</s> that did you my lord osgod said and no man obeys your orders morereadily than i and anything that you bid me do i am willing to do ifpossible but in this it was not possible for i could not remain at yorkeither in rest or quiet</s>  i should have had fever in my blood and would bythis time have been lying as deep in the earth as harold of norway himself</s> therefore in order to get the rest and quiet you had ordered it wasnecessary for me to come south</s>  as you had left me well supplied withmoney i was able to do so in comfort and though i could well enough walki have had myself carried in a litter by easy stages</s>  i reached london onwednesday night having been a fortnight on the way and i arrived here anhour since</s>  each day i walked a little so as to keep my health andexercise my limbs and so well have i succeeded that my wound has wellnighhealed and although i doubt whether i shall be able to use a heavy axe itrust i shall be able to strike hard enough with the right hand to split afew norman helms</s> but the exertion may set your wounds bleeding afresh osgod wulf saidunable to repress a smile at osgods argument</s> methinks there is no fear of that</s>  the most nights i have slept atmonasteries and have inquired from the monks whom i told that i mustneeds stand by your side today whether i should be fit</s>  they said atfirst that there would be some risk in the matter but that if i continuedto take rest and quiet as i was doing and the wound continued to healfavourably it was possible if i abstained from actual fighting i mightdo so but of late they have spoken more confidently</s>  i told the monk whoseared my arm to do it heartily for a little pain more or less was ofsmall account so that he made a good job of it</s>  and so what with the restand quiet and my mind being at ease it went on so well that a monk whoexamined it at westminster on wednesday evening told me that save for thehealing of the skin the wound was pretty nigh cured and that he thoughtthere was no chance whatever of its breaking out afresh</s>  he bandaged ittightly to prevent any rush of blood into the veins and though when idrove an axe just now into that stump yonder i felt that i had not gotback my strength fully i expect when i warm to the work i shall strike asstrongly as most</s> well at any rate you must take care of yourself osgod</s>  you can aid mein keeping our men steady but i charge you not to fight yourself unlessyou see the line waver</s>  then you can of course throw yourself into thefray</s> i will keep myself back for that master but i am sure we shall all haveto do our best before sunset and as all will be risking their lives thereis no reason why i should not do so as well as the rest</s> the troops made a hearty breakfast from the food they carried and quenchedtheir thirst at the little stream that ran down by the side of the slopethen they were told off to the ground they were to occupy</s> at nine in the morning the vanguard of the norman army appeared over thebrow of a rise and the english at once took up their positions</s>  in thecentre were the housecarls of the royal house and those of the thanestogether with the men of kent whose right it was ever to be in the frontof a battle and the london citizens under their sheriff</s>  all these werearmed and attired like the housecarls</s>
 in the centre of this array flew theroyal standard and around it were the three royal brothers aelfwig theiruncle with his monks cowl over his helmet and their nephew hakon theson of sweyn</s>  the housecarls were in a triple line</s>  to the left and rightof them were the levies as brave as their more heavily armed comrades butaltogether without discipline and armed in the most primitive manner</s>  afew only carried swords or axes the majority had spears or javelins</s>  manyhad only forks or sharp stakes while some carried stone hammers and axessuch as were used by their primitive ancestors</s> as the norman army wound down from the opposite hill and formed up in theorder of battle harold rode along in front of his line exhorting all tostand firm</s> they were there he said to defend their country and to defend theircountry they had but to hold the hill</s>  were they steadfast and firm theycould assuredly resist the attack of this host who came to capture andplunder england</s> the order in which the normans prepared for battle was similar to that ofthe english</s>  both commanders had been well informed by spies of thestrength and position of their opponents and the duke placed his triednorman troops in the centre to match themselves against the englishhousecarls</s>  his breton contingent was on his left while on the right werethe french the flemings and the other foreign adventurers who had come tofight under his banner</s>  in the front line were the archers and slingerswho were to open the battle and shake the line of the defenders</s>  behindthese came the infantry who were to hew down the palisades and clear a wayfor the cavalry charge full into the centre of the english host</s> a norman trumpet gave the signal for the commencement of the battle andthe archers along the whole line poured a storm of arrows into the english</s> it was unanswered for there were few bowmen among the defenders of thehill and the distance was too great for the javelinmen to hurl theirmissiles</s>  after the archers had shot several volleys of arrows they fellback and the infantry advanced against the hill but before they did sotaillifer a norman minstrel dashed forward on horseback and spurring upthe ascent tossing his sword in the air and catching it as it fell rodeup to the english line</s>  one man he pierced with a lance another he cutdown with his sword and then fell dead under the blow of a heavy axe</s> this mad exploit had scarce terminated when the norman infantry advanced upthe hill</s>  they were greeted with a shower of stones and javelins whichslew many but with unbroken front they pressed upwards until they reachedthe palisade</s>  here a desperate struggle began</s>  the norman sword and spearwere met by the axes of the housecarls and the clubs spears and forks ofthe levies</s>  in vain norman breton frenchmen and fleming strove to breakthe english line</s>  the high position of the defenders gave them a greatadvantage over their assailants among whose crowded ranks the javelinmendid great execution while the normans could receive little aid from theirarchers</s>  both sides fought with obstinate valour</s>  the norman battlecry wasgod help us</s>  the english god almighty and the holy cross</s>  the latterinvocation being to the relic at waltham which was the kings specialobject of devotion</s> with jeering cries too they greeted the efforts of their assailants tocross the palisade and break their line</s>  at last the norman infantry fellback broken and baffled having suffered terrible loss and now the knightsand horsemen who formed the backbone of williams army rode up the hill</s> the duke himself as well as his brother odo bishop of bayeau who foughtbeside him had laid aside their norman swords and were armed with heavymaces weapons as formidable as the english axe</s>  but the valour of thehorsemen the strength of their armour the length of their lances and theweight of their horses availed no more against the shieldwall of thehousecarls than the infantry had done</s>  the superior height and strength ofthe english and the sweep of their terrible battleaxes counterbalancedthe advantage the horses afforded to the normans and the hithertoirresistible chivalry of normandy and france were for the first timedashed backwards by trained infantry</s> in front of the english line the ground was thickly covered with fallen menand horses</s>  there were but few wounded among them for where the englishaxe fell whether on horse or rider it did its work thoroughly</s>  but theenglish too had suffered</s>  the action of swinging the axe with both armsabove the head left the neck and upper part of the body exposed and manyhad fallen pierced through and through by the norman spears</s>  a great shoutof triumph rose from the english line as the norman horsemen unable to domore fell sullenly back down the hill</s>  as in the centre the king with histhanes and housecarls had repelled the attack of the normans so on theflanks the english levies had held their ground against the bretons andfrench but carried away by their exultation the levies on the rightforgetful of harolds express orders that no man was to stir from his placeuntil he himself gave the signal for pursuit broke their line and rushingdown the hill fell on the retreating bretons</s> unable to withstand the onslaught and already disheartened by theirfailure the bretons fled in wild alarm and rushing towards the centre forprotection threw the normans also into confusion</s>  the panic spread rapidlythe host wavered and had already begun to fly when william throwing offhis helmet rode among them and exhorting some and striking others with alance he had caught up at last restored order and the breton infantryrallied and fell upon their pursuers killing many and driving the restback up the hill</s> again the norman infantry and cavalry together advanced up the hill andthe terrible struggle recommenced</s>  william and his brother the bishopperformed prodigies of valour but not less valiantly fought harold ofengland and his brothers</s>  the palisade was by this time destroyed in manyplaces and desperate handtohand contests now took place</s>  cutting his waythrough meaner foes the duke strove to reach the royal standard andencounter harold himself</s>  he was nearing his goal when gurth sprangforward eager above all things to protect harold from harm</s>  he hurled ajavelin at william but the dart struck the normans horse only and itfell beneath him</s>  william leapt to his feet and springing upon gurth smotewith his heavy mace full on his helmet and the noble earl of east angliafell dead at his feet</s>  almost at the same moment his brother leofwinfighting sword in hand was slain</s>  but the fall of the two royal brothersin no way changed the fate of the battle</s>  the men of kent and essexfurious at the fall of their beloved earls fought even more fiercely thanbefore to avenge their deaths</s> william had remounted but his second horse was also slain</s>  eustace ofboulogne offered him his horse and himself mounting that of one of hisfollowers they fell together upon the english line but all the valour ofthe duke and his chivalry failed to break it</s>  on the french left thebretons had indeed succeeded in completely destroying the palisade butthe levies stood firm and no impression was made upon their solid line</s> the attack had failed and even william saw that it was hopeless any moreto hurl his troops against the shieldwall but the manner in which theenglish irregulars had been induced to break their array led him to try bya feigned retreat to induce them to repeat their error</s>  while the fight yetraged around him he sent orders to the bretons to turn and flee and thenif the defenders pursued them to turn upon them while he ordered a portionof his norman force to make straight for the gap as soon as the englishleft their posts</s> the stratagem was successful</s>  again with exulting shouts the levies pouredout in pursuit of the bretons</s>  these fled for some distance and thensuddenly turning fell on their pursuers</s>  illarmed and undisciplined as thelevies were and unable to withstand the attack of such overwhelmingnumbers they bore themselves gallantly</s>  one party took possession of asmall outlying hill and with showers of darts and stones they killed ordrove off all who attacked them</s>  the greater part however made their wayto broken ground to the west of the hill and made a stand on the steepbank of a small ravine</s>  the french horsemen charging down upon themunaware of the existence of the ravine fell into it and were slaughteredin such numbers by the knives and spears of the english that the ravine waswellnigh filled up with their dead bodies</s> but gallantly as the levies had retrieved their error it was a fatal one</s> as soon as they had left their line the normans told off for the dutypressed into the gap and were followed by the whole of their main bodyand thus the english lost the advantage of position and the contendinghosts faced each other on the hill the ground now occupied by the normansbeing somewhat higher than that on which the housecarls stood</s>  it was nowabout three in the afternoon and the fight had been raging for six hoursbut though thus outflanked and the order of their battle destroyed theveterans of harold showed neither alarm nor discouragement</s>  their formationwas changed the shieldwall still faced the normans and for a time everyeffort to break it failed</s> in vain the norman cavalry charged down upon it in vain their duke pliedhis terrible mace</s>  occasionally men worn out by the long defensive battlesprang from the english ranks and engaged knight or baron hand to hand</s>  allalong the line such singlehanded conflicts were going on and the roar ofbattle was as loud and fierce as at the beginning of the day</s>  so for threemore hours the fight went on with diminishing numbers but withundiminished bravery the english still held their ground and as twilightwas now closing in it seemed as if they would maintain it till nightfall</s> then william ordered up his archers again bade them shoot their arrowshigh into the air so that they should fall among the king and his thanesgrouped round the standard</s> the effect was terrible</s>  through helm and shoulderguard the arrows madetheir way the soldiers held their shields above their heads but thethanes had no such protection</s>  harold glanced up for a moment and as ifdirected by the hand of fate an arrow struck him full in the eye and hefell prostrate as if struck by a thunderbolt</s>  a cry of horror and dismayburst from the thanes around him but there was no time for the indulgenceof grief</s>  the normans too had seen the king fall and with shouts oftriumph a body of knights tried to force their way in to take possession ofhis body</s>  but so long as an englishman could swing axe this was not to beand the assault was repulsed as others had been before</s>  nor when the newsof harolds fall spread did the brave housecarls lose heart but sternlyand obstinately as ever held together</s> at last the normans burst in at the centre each baron and knight strivingto be the first to pluck down the standards the one the kings owncognizance the other the national banner that waved side by side</s>  oneafter another the thanes were smitten down</s>  not one asked for quarter notone turned his back upon the foe</s> beorn and wulf had through the long fight stood side by side and thewatchfulness with which they guarded each other had carried them so farunharmed through it</s> it is all over now beorn wulf said</s>  but it is not hard to die forwith harold the cause of england is lost</s> at any rate we will sell our lives dearly beorn said as he struck anorman knight from his horse</s>  but they were the last defenders of thestandards and the end was at hand</s>  blows rained down upon them</s>  beorn wasbeaten on to one knee wulf was so exhausted by his exertions that he

as he watched the litter escorted by the twomonks carried along the road</s> poor lady indeed</s>  wulf repeated and yet there are thousands in englandand normandy who were widowed yesterday and maybe she is better off thanmany</s>  she lost harold the day she resigned him to another and it washarder perhaps to be parted from him in that fashion than to know that heis dead now</s>  she can think of him as his true widow for assuredly thequeen who never cared aught for him is a widow but in name</s>  before edithwas tortured by the desire to see him and to comfort him and yet hismarriage stood as

not hislast restingplace</s>  the duke at present doubtless felt constrained at firstto refuse him christian burial for had he granted gythas request itwould have been an acknowledgment that the charges brought against him wereunfounded and the excommunication of no avail but i doubt not that intime he will allow his body to be taken to his abbey at waltham</s>  now hesaid less gravely in

exclaimed passionately and i would thatwulf and i could meet them in fair lists and fight them</s> they will do nothing wulf said more quietly</s>  they will hasten to makethe best terms they can for themselves and will ask to be permitted tohold their earldoms as his vassals</s>  but they will not long enjoy theirtreachery they are ever intriguers and as soon as they see theiropportunity will conspire against william as they conspired against harold</s> thank heaven they will receive scantier mercy at his hands than theyreceived at the kings</s>  as for the south and east who is to lead them</s> there is no one left to whom they can look for guidance doubtless in someplaces they will resist but such resistance can only bring ruin upon thosewho attempt it</s>  maybe some will take to the forests or the great easternmarshes and may perhaps hold out for months or even years</s>  but what canit avail in the end</s>  had harold escaped alive there would have been many abattle as obstinate as that of yesterday to fight before england wasconquered</s>  had any of the greater thanes escaped men would have flocked tothem but they are all gone save the few that were found

no resistance were made</s>  dukewilliam has shown himself a wise and just ruler in normandy and willdoubtless prove himself the same in england if he be not angered by revoltsand risings</s>  it is hard that englishmen should be ruled by a foreigner butit is no new thing for us</s>  we saxons conquered the britons and in turndanish kings have ruled over us but saxon and dane have become almost

dukespromise was publicly made and he will certainly adhere to it even if hewished it he could not after charging harold with perjury break his ownpromise</s> the sun was sinking when they reached pevensey for the search for haroldsbody and the building of his cairn had occupied many hours</s>  they went atonce on board one of the ships de burg had himself furnished for theexpedition and two days later landed at rouen</s>  they had brought horseswith them and the two young thanes at once rode with the baron to hischateau leaving osgod to be brought after them in his litter</s>  lord de burgwas received with the greatest joy by his wife guy and agnes</s>  they hadbeen in a state of terrible anxiety for the last twentyfour hours for aswift ship had been despatched by the duke with the

outburst of delight was over the baroncalled in wulf and beorn who had not followed him into the room feelingthat he would prefer to greet his family alone</s>  guy gave an exclamation ofsurprise and pleasure as they came forward</s> these are my prisoners the baron said with a smile if i can callprisoners those who have never surrendered</s>  the duke has intrusted them tomy keeping and has ordered that you shall hold them in safe custody</s> lord de burg does not tell you lady that he saved our lives which butfor him were assuredly lost</s>  we were wellnigh spent and were surroundedby a ring of foes when he broke in and stood beside us proclaiming that theduke himself had given a pledge for our safety</s> i have paid part of the debt we owe the baron said though i saved themat no cost to myself while wulf defended guy at the risk of his life</s> how long do you stay with us my lord</s> as long as i can wife</s>  i went as you know unwillingly to the war butwhen all the norman barons followed the duke i could not hold back</s>  but itrust to have no more of it so terrible a field no man living has seenand in truth until twilight fell it seemed that we should be beaten withsuch obstinacy and endurance did the english fight</s>  we won but it was avictory over the dead rather than the living</s>  of harolds regular troops noman turned no man asked for quarter they fell where they stood and eventhe irregulars who had fought with equal bravery when as night fell andall was lost they fled inflicted wellnigh as heavy a blow upon us as hadbeen dealt during the day</s>  i have no animosity against them they arevaliant men and were in their right in defending their country and iwould that i could stay peacefully here until the last blow has beenstruck</s>  i am well content with my estates and need no foot of englishland no share in english spoil i must fight for my liege lord as long asfighting goes on but that over i hope to return here and live in

suppose thanes you will notobject to give me your parole to attempt no escape</s> willingly my lord beorn said</s>  if contrary to our opinion englandshould rise and fight one more battle for freedom we will give you duenotice that we shall if possible escape and cross the sea to join ourcountrymen</s> that is fair enough de burg said with a smile and the moment you giveme notice i will clap you into so firm a cage that i warrant you will notescape from it but i trust the necessity will not arise</s>  now guy takeyour friends to their chambers and see to their comfort</s>  i will not tellthe story of the battle until you return for doubtless you are burning tohear it and in truth it will be famous in all times both as one of thesturdiest fights ever heard of and because such great issues depended onits results</s> when guy returned with his friends and a meal had been eaten de burg toldthe story of the battle of senlac</s> such is the story as far as i know it he added in conclusion but intruth beyond the beginning and the end and the fact that we twice fellback and at one time were flying in headlong rout to our ships i knownothing</s>  all day i was striving to break through a living wall andstriving in vain</s>  i can see now the close line of shields the helmetcovered faces above them and the terrible axes rising and fallingcleaving through helmet and hauberk as if they had been pasteboard</s>  it maywellnigh be said that we have no wounded for each man struck fell in histrack as if smitten by lightning</s>  can you add more thanes</s> beorn shook his head</s> it is like a dream wulf said</s>  we never moved through the long day</s>  attimes there was a short lull and then each man was fighting as best hecould</s>  i know that my arms grew tired and that my axe seemed to growheavier that horse and foot swept up to us and there was occasionallybreathing time that the royal brothers voices rose ever cheeringly andencouragingly until gurth and leofwin fell and after that harolds alonewas heard though i think it came to my ears as from a distance so greatwas the tumult so great our exertions</s>  when harold died i knew that allwas lost but even that did not seem to affect me</s>  i had become a sort ofmachine and fought almost mechanically with a dim consciousness that theend was close at hand</s>  it was only at the last when beorn and i stood backto back that i seemed myself again and was animated with new strengththat came i suppose from despair</s> it was an awful day de burg said</s>  i have fought in many battles underthe dukes banner but the sternest of them were but paltry skirmishes incomparison to this</s>  half of the nobles of normandy lie dead half the armythat filled the mighty fleet that sailed from st</s>  valery have fallen</s> william is king of england but whether that will in the end repay normandyfor the loss she has suffered seems to me very doubtful</s>  and now let us tobed</s>  i sleep not well on shipboard and in truth i had such dreams of deathand slaughter that i ever awoke bathed with sweat and in such fear that idared not go to sleep again</s> at the end of a week the baron sailed again for england</s>  to the two youngenglishmen the following weeks passed pleasantly</s>  ships came frequentlyfrom england with news of what was doing there</s>  william had tarried forsome time at his camp at hastings expecting to receive the submission ofall england</s>  but not an englishman came to bow before him</s>  the northernearls had hurried to london as soon as they heard of the defeat at senlacand the death of the king and his brothers and a witan was instantlysummoned to choose his successor to the throne</s> edwin and morcar thought that the choice of the nation would surely fallupon one or other of them as in rank and position they were now the firstmen in the realm</s>  they exerted themselves to the utmost to bring thisabout but no truehearted englishman could forgive either their acceptanceof harold hardrada as their king or the long and treacherous delay thathad left southern england to stand alone on the day of battle</s>  the choiceof the witan fell on the young edgar the grandson of edmund ironside thelast male survivor of the royal blood</s>  edgar however was never crownedas that ceremony could only take place at one of the festivals of thechurch and it was therefore postponed until christmas</s>  london was eagerfor resistance</s>  alfred had fought battle after battle against the danesand though without their natural leaders the people throughout southernengland looked forward to a long and determined struggle</s>  with the army ofthe north as a rallying centre a force more numerous than that which haroldhad led might soon be gathered</s>  but these hopes were dashed to the groundby the treacherous northern earls</s>  had one of them been chosen to sit onthe vacant throne they would doubtless have done their best to maintainthat throne but they had been passed over and oblivious of the fact thatit was to the south they owed the rescue of their earldoms from the sway ofthe king of norway and tostig they sullenly marched away with their armyand left the south to its fate</s> while the cause of england was thus being betrayed and ruined william wasadvancing eastward along the coast ravaging and destroying</s>  romney waslevelled to the ground and its inhabitants slain</s>  dover opened its gates</s> it is probable that most of the male population had joined harold and hadfallen at senlac and that the terrible fate of romney had struck suchterror into the hearts of the inhabitants who knew there was no army thatcould advance to their assistance that they surrendered at the conquerorsapproach</s>  to them william behaved with lenity and kindness</s>  his severity atromney and his lenity at dover had their effect</s>  there being no centralauthority no army in the field each town and district was left to shiftfor itself and assuredly none of them unaided could hope to offerprolonged resistance to the normans</s>  as after eight days stay at doverwilliam advanced towards canterbury he was met by a deputation of thecitizens offering their submission and soon from all parts of kent similarmessages came in</s> kent had done its full share in the national defence on the hill nearhastings and was not to be blamed if when all england remained supine andinactive its villagers refused to throw away their lives uselessly</s>  theduke was detained by sickness for a month near canterbury and therereceived the submission of kent and sussex and also that of the greatecclesiastical city of winchester but the spirit of resistance in londonstill burned brightly and william was indisposed to risk the loss thatwould be incurred by an assault upon its walls</s>  he therefore moved roundin a wide circle wasting the land plundering and destroying till thecitizens convinced that resistance could only bring destruction uponthemselves and their city and in spite of the efforts of their woundedsheriff sent an embassy to the duke at berkhampstead to submit and dohomage to him</s> not london alone was represented by this embassy</s>  the young king electedbut uncrowned was with it two archbishops two bishops and many of thechief men in england accompanied it and although they were not thespokesmen of any witan they might be said fairly to represent london andsouthern england</s> deserted by the north without a leader and seeing their land exposed towholesale ravages the south and west saxons were scarcely to be blamed forpreferring submission to destruction</s>  they doubtless thought that williamthe wise ruler of normandy would make a far better king than the boy theyhad chosen who was himself almost as much a foreigner as william savethat there was a strain of english royal blood in his veins</s>  so had englandaccepted canute the dane as her king and he had ruled as an englishmonarch wisely and well</s> the embassy offered william the crown</s>  the norman prelates and priests whoheld so many of the dignities in the english church had worked hard toincline mens minds to this end</s>  silent while england stood united underits king to oppose the invader their tongues were loosed as soon as thestrength of england was broken and its king dead and they pointed out thatgod had clearly designated william as their king by giving him victory andby destroying alike harold and his brothers</s> william went through the farce of hesitating to accept the offer of thecrown and held a consultation with his officers as to the answer he shouldgive</s>  they of course replied that he should accept the offer</s>  williamtherefore marched with his army to london where on christmasday the sameprelate who had anointed harold king of england crowned william as hissuccessor</s> a few days later beorn and wulf with osgod who had now completelyrecovered from his wounds set sail for england</s>  there was no longer anyreason why they should not take their oaths to serve william</s>  he was thecrowned king of england the accepted of the people as harold had beenand when all southern england had submitted it was not for them who hadreceived special favours at williams hand to hold back</s>  with them wentlady de burg guy and agnes with many other norman ladies on their way torejoin their lords in london</s>  baron de burg on the day after theirarrival at westminster led the two young thanes to the private apartmentof the king</s>  he received them graciously</s> there are none of your nation he said whose homage i more gladlyaccept</s>  you fought valiantly before under my banner and will i am surebe ready to do so again should occasion arise</s>  i am thankful to my lord deburg that he interposed in my name and saved your lives</s>  i have notforgotten the other part of my promise and have this morning ordered myjusticiar to add to your estates forfeited lands adjoining</s> beorn and wulf had previously talked the matter over</s>  their owninclinations would have led them to refuse the offer but as it was certainthat all the land forfeited to the crown by the death of its holders inbattle would be apportioned among williams norman followers they thoughtthat it would be wholly for the benefit both of the families of the latethanes and for their tenants and people that they should accept any estatewilliam might bestow on them</s>  they therefore thanked the duke insuitable terms and at once took the oaths for the lands he might bepleased to bestow on them</s>  a week later they received the formal deedswhich in both cases more than doubled the estates they before possessed</s> the same evening lord de burg said to wulf who had tarried in londonwhile beorn had at once set out for fareham i think the time has comewulf when i can speak of a subject that has been in my thoughts for a longtime and which although you have not spoken has as my wife and i haveboth seen been dear to you</s>  normandy and england are now one and we arevassals of the same king</s>  as long as there was a probability thatenglishmen and normans might again be ranged in battle against each otherit was not expedient that aught should be done in the matter but now thisobstacle is removed i can offer you the alliance on which i am sure yourheart is set and give you the hand of my daughter in marriage</s> it is the greatest wish of my life wulf replied gratefully</s>  i shouldhave asked you for her hand before had it not been for the position ofpublic affairs</s>  i love her dearly though i have until now abstained fromspeaking and yet i would not wed her unless her heart went freely with herhand</s> i think not that she will be disobedient to my wishes de burg saidsmiling</s>  she has proved deaf to all her norman suitors and although amongthem were some whom few maidens would have said no to her mother and i hadno wish to force her inclinations especially as we both shrewdly suspectedwhere her heart had been bestowed</s>  this alliance too has long been thedearest wish of guy</s>  on the bed of sickness where he lay so long and fromwhich it seemed at one time that he would never rise he often spoke to meof it</s>  he was fondly attached to his sister and again and again said thathe wished of all things that you should some day become her husband as hewas sure her happiness would be safe with you and that you would worthilyfill his place to us and would when the time came rule nobly over thelands of de burg</s> god forbid that that should ever be the case wulf said earnestly</s>  itrust that guy will live long and that he will marry and leave descendantsto follow him</s> the baron shook his head sadly</s>  guy is better he said but he is stillweak and fragile and the leeches tell me that a rough winter or an illnessthat would be nought to others might carry him off</s>  i have small hopes thathe will ever marry</s>  i am sure that no such thought is in his mind</s>  he is aseager now as he was four years ago that you should be a son to us and ahusband to agnes</s>  he has also earnestly expressed the wish in which i alsojoin that you should take our name</s>  you english have no family names butthat will come with other norman customs and marrying a de burg it wouldseem natural that you should yourself become wulf de burg</s> i should feel it a high honour</s>  there is no more noble name in normandyand i trust i may prove worthy of bearing it</s> that i have no fear of wulf else i should not have offered you the handof my daughter</s>  i will bring my wife and guy in</s>  i have offered you thehand of agnes but it is right that you should ask her mothers consentalthough beforehand assured of it</s> he left the room and soon returned with lady de burg and guy</s> my lord has told me she said before wulf could speak that you wouldask my consent to your marriage with agnes</s>  i give it you unasked freelyand gladly</s>  i have but one regretthat the seas will divide us</s> not so the baron said williams court will be held in london and foryears he will reside here far more than in normandy and will expect hisnobles to be frequently with him</s>  i certainly shall not come alone and youwill therefore have as many opportunities of seeing agnes as if she weremarried to a norman whose estates did not lie near our own</s> i thank you most deeply lady de burg for the confidence which you showin intrusting your daughters happiness to me</s>  i swear that with all mymight and power i will strive to make her happy and will spare her tovisit you in normandy whensoever you may wish it</s> guy came forward now and grasped wulfs

norman maiden united to an english noble ofwhom he has so high an opinion</s> fond as wulf was of his old home he saw that it would be best to abandon itfor a new residence more suited to the times
