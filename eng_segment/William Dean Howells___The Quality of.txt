easily and made their bells jangle noisily togetherthe bursts of sound evoked by their firm and nervous pace died back inshowers and falling drops of music</s>  all the time elbridge swore at

fountain of meaninglessmaledictions the public hackman who admired elbridge almost as much ashe respected elbridges horses they were really northwicks but theprofessional convention was that they were elbridges clothed themwith fond curses as with a garment</s>  he was himself more literallyspeaking clothed in an old ulster much frayed about the wrists andskirts and polished across the middle of the back by rubbing againstcounters and windowsills</s>  he was bearded like a patriarch and he worea rusty fur cap pulled down over his ears though it was not very coldits peak rested on the point of his nose so that he had to throw hishead far back to get elbridge in the field of his vision</s>  elbridge hadon a high hat and was smoothly buttoned to his throat in a plaincoachmans coat of black northwick had never cared to have him make acloser approach to a livery and it is doubtful if elbridge would havedone it if he had asked or ordered it of him</s>  he deferred to northwickin a measure

mostremarkable that he should have come all the way from boston on the sametrain with northwick and not known it but northwick was less disposedto wonder at it</s>  he passed rapidly beyond the following of mr</s>  gerrishand mounted to the place elbridge made for him in the cutter</s>  whileelbridge was still tucking the robes about their legs northwick droveaway from the station and through the village up to the rim of thehighland that lies between hatboro and south hatboro</s>  the bare linecut along the horizon where the sunset lingered in a light of liquidcrimson paling and passing into weaker violet tints with every momentbut still tenderly flushing the walls of the sky and holding longer theaccent of its color where a keen star had here and there already piercedit and shone quivering through</s>  the shortest days were past but in thefirst week of february they had not lengthened sensibly though to afiner perception there was the promise of release from the winter darkif not from the winter cold</s>  it was not far from six oclock whennorthwick mounted the southward rise of the street it was still almostlight enough to read and the little slender black figure of a man thatstarted up in the middle of the road as if it had risen out of theground had an even vivid distinctness</s>  he must have been lying in thesnow the horses crouched back with a sudden recoil as if he had struckthem back with his arm and plunged the runners of the cutter into thedeeper snow beside the beaten track</s>  he made a slight pause long enoughto give northwick a contemptuous glance and then continued along theroad at a leisurely pace to the deep cut through the snow from the nexthouse</s>  here he stood regarding such difficulty as northwick had inquieting his horses and getting underway again</s>  he said nothing andnorthwick did not speak elbridge growled hes on one of his tearsagain and the horses dashed forward with a shriek of all their bells</s> northwick did not open his lips till he entered the avenue of firs thatled from the highway to his house they were still clogged with thesnowfall and their lowermost branches were buried in the drifts</s> whats the matter with the colt</s>  he asked</s> i dont know as that fellow understands the colts feet very well</s>  iguess one of the shoes is set wrong said elbridge</s> better look after it</s> northwick left elbridge the reins and got out of the cutter at theflight of granite steps which rose to the groundfloor of his woodenpalace</s>  broad levels of piazza stretched away from the entrance under aportico of that carpentry which so often passes with us forarchitecture</s>  in spite of the effect of organic flimsiness in everywooden structure but a log cabin or a fishermans cottage shingled tothe ground the house suggested a perfect functional comfort</s>  there weredouble windows on all round the piazzas a mellow glow from theincandescent electrics penetrated to the outer dusk from them when thedoor was opened to northwick a pleasant heat gushed out together withthe perfume of flowers and the odors of dinner</s> dinner is just served sir said the inside man disposing ofnorthwicks overcoat and hat on the hall table with respectful scruple</s> northwick hesitated</s>  he stood over the register and vaguely held hishands in the pleasant warmth indirectly radiated from the steampipesbelow</s> the young ladies were just thinking you wouldnt be home till the nexttrain the man suggested at the sound of voices from the diningroom</s> they have some one with them</s>  northwick asked</s> yes sir</s>  the rector sir mr</s>  wade sir</s> ill come down by and by northwick said turning to the stairs</s>  sayi had a late lunch before i left town</s> yes sir said the man</s> northwick went on up stairs with footfalls hushed by the thicklypaddedthick carpet and turned into the sort of study that opened out of hisbedroom</s>  it had been his wifes parlor during the few years of her lifein the house which he had built for her and which they had planned tospend their old age in together</s>  it faced southward and looked out overthe greenhouses and the gardens that stretched behind the house to thebulk of woods shutting out the stagepicturesqueness of the summersettlement of south hatboro</s>  she had herself put the rockingchair inthe sunny baywindow and northwick had not allowed it to be disturbedthere since her death</s>  in an alcove at one side he had made a place forthe safe where he kept his papers his wife had intended to keep theirsilver in it but she had been scared by the notion of having burglarsso close to them in the night and had always left the silver in thesafe in the diningroom</s> she was all her life a timorous creature and after her marriage hadseldom felt safe out of northwicks presence</s>  her portrait by hunthanging over the mantelpiece suggested something of this though thepainter had made the most of her thin middleaged blond good looks andhad given her a substance of general character which was more expressiveof his own free and bold style than of the facts in the case</s>  she wasreally one of those henminded women who are so common in all walks oflife and are made up of only one aim at a time and of manifoldanxieties at all times</s>  her instinct for saving long survived the daysof struggle in which she had joined it to northwicks instinct forgetting she lived and died in the hope if not the belief that she hadcontributed to his prosperity by looking strictly after all manner ofvalueless odds and ends</s>  but he had been passively happy with her sinceher death he had allowed her to return much into his thoughts fromwhich her troublesome solicitudes and her entire uselessness inimportant matters had obliged him to push her while she lived</s>  he oftenhad times when it seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing andthen he found he had been thinking of her</s>  at such times with a panghe realized that he missed her but perhaps the wound was to habitrather than affection</s>  he now sat down in his swivelchair and turned itfrom the writingdesk which stood on the rug before the fireplace andlooked up into the eyes of her effigy with a sense of her intangiblepresence in it and with a dumb longing to rest his soul against hers</s> she was the only one who could have seen him in his wish to have notbeen what he was she would have denied it to his face if he had toldher he was a thief and as he meant to make himself more and more athief her love would have eased the way by full acceptance of thetheories that ran along with his intentions and covered them withpretences of necessity</s>  he thought how even his own mother could nothave been so much comfort to him she would have had the mercy but shewould not have had the folly</s>  at the bottom of his heart and under allhis pretences northwick knew that it was not mercy which would helphim but he wanted it as we all want what is comfortable and bad for usat times</s>  with the performance and purpose of a thief in his heart heturned to the pictured face of his dead wife as his refuge from the faceof all living</s>  it could not look at him as if he were a thief</s> the word so filled his mind that it seemed always about to slip from histongue</s>  it was what the president of the board had called him when thefact of his fraudulent manipulation of the companys books was laid sodistinctly before him that even the insane refusal which the criminalinstinctively makes of his crime in its presence was impossible</s>  theother directors sat blankly round and said nothing not because theyhated a scene but because the ordinary course of life among us had notsupplied them with the emotional materials for making one</s>  thepresident however had jumped from his seat and advanced uponnorthwick</s>
 what does all this mean sir</s>  ill tell you what it means</s> it means that youre a thief sir the same as if you had picked mypocket or stolen my horse or taken my overcoat out of my hall</s>
he shook his clenched fist in northwicks face and seemed about to takehim by the throat</s>  afterwards he inclined more to mercy than the othersit was he who carried the vote which allowed northwick three daysgrace to look into his affairs and lay before the directors the proofthat he had ample means as he maintained to meet the shortage in theaccounts</s>  i wish you well out of it for your familys sake he saidat parting but all the same sir you are a thief</s> he put his hands ostentatiously in his pockets when some othersmeaninglessly shook hands with northwick at parting as northwickhimself might have shaken hands with another in his place and hebrushed by him out of the door without looking at him</s>  he came suddenlyback to say if it were a question of you alone i would cheerfullylose something more than youve robbed me of for the pleasure of seeingyou handcuffed in this room and led to jail through the street by aconstable</s>  no honest man no man who was not always a rogue at heartcould have done what youve done juggled with the books for years andbewitched the record so by your infernal craft that it was neversuspected till now</s>  youve given mind to your scoundrelly work sirall the mind you had for if you hadnt been so anxious to stealsuccessfully youd have given more mind to the use of your stealings</s> you may have some of them left but it looks as if youd made ducksand drakes of them like any petty rascal in the hands of the employeesinsurance company</s>  yes sir i believe youre of about the intellectualcalibre of that sort of thief</s>  i cant respect you even on your ownground</s>  but im willing to give you the chance you ask for yourdaughters sake</s>  shes been in and out of my house with my girl like oneof my own children and i wont send her father to jail if i can helpit</s>  understand</s>  i havent any sentiment for you northwick</s>  youre thekind of rogue id like to see in a convicts jacket learning to makeshoebrushes</s>  but you shall have your chance to go home and see if youcan pay up somehow and you shant be shadowed while youre at it</s>  youshall keep your outside to the world three days longer you whitedsepulchre but if you want to know i think the best thing that couldhappen to you on your way home would be a good railroad accident</s> the mans words and looks were burnt into northwicks memory which nowseemed to have the faculty of simultaneously reproducing them all</s> northwick remembered his purple face with its prominent eyes and theswing of his large stomach and just how it struck against the jamb ashe whirled a second time out of the door</s>  the other directors some ofthem stood round buttoned up in their overcoats with their hats onand a sort of stunned aspect some held their hats in their hands andlooked down into them with a decorous absence of expression as peopledo at a funeral</s>  then they left him alone in the treasurers privateroom with its official luxury of thick turkey rugs leathernarmchairs and nickelplated cuspidors standing one on each side of thehearth where a fire of soft coal in a lowdown grate burned with asubdued and respectful flicker</s> ii</s> if it had not been for the boisterous indignation of the presidentnorthwick might have come away from the meeting after the exposure ofhis defalcations with an unimpaired personal dignity</s>  but as it was hefelt curiously shrunken and shattered till the prevailing habit of hismind enabled him to piece himself together again and resume his formersize and shape</s>  this happened very quickly he had conceived of himselfso long as a man employing funds in his charge in speculations sometimessuccessful and sometimes not but at all times secured by his personalprobity and reliability</s>  he had in fact more than once restored all thathe had taken and he had come to trust himself in the course of thesetransactions as fully as he was trusted by the men who were ignorant ofhis irregularities</s>  he was somehow flattered by the complete confidencethey reposed in him though he really felt it to be no more than hisdue he had always merited and received the confidence of men associatedwith him in business and he had come to regard the funds of thecorporation as practically his own</s>  in the early days of his connectionwith the company it largely owed its prosperity to his wise and carefulmanagement one might say that it was not until the last when he got sobadly caught by that drop in railroads that he had felt anything wrongin his convertible use of its money</s>  it was an informality he would nothave denied that but it was merely an informality</s>  then his lossessuddenly leaped beyond his ability to make them good then for thefirst time he began to practice that system in keeping the books whichthe furious president called juggling with them</s>  even this measure heconsidered a justifiable means of selfdefence pending the difficultieswhich beset him and until he could make his losses good by otheroperations</s>  from time to time he was more fortunate and whenever hedramatized himself in an explanation to the directors as he often didespecially of late he easily satisfied them as to the nature of hismotives and the propriety of his behavior by calling their attention tothese successful deals and to the probability the entire probabilitythat he could be at any moment in a position to repay all he hadborrowed of the company</s>  he called it borrowing and in his long habitof making himself these loans and returning them he had come to have asort of vague feeling that the company was privy to them that it wasalmost an understood thing</s>  the presidents violence was the firstintimation to reach him in the heart of his artificial consciousnessthat his action was at all in the line of those foolish peculators whosediscovery and flight to canada was the commonplace of every morningspaper such a commonplace that he had been sensible of an effort in thepapers to vary the tiresome repetition of the same old fact by somenovel grace of wit or some fresh picturesqueness in putting it</s>  in thepresence of the directors he had refused to admit it to himself butafter they adjourned and he was left alone he realized the truth</s>  hewas like those fools exactly like them in what they had done and inthe way of doing it he was like them in motive and principle</s>  all ofthem had used others money in speculation expecting to replace it andthen had not been able to replace it and then had skipped as thenewspapers said</s> whether he should complete the parallel and skip too was a pointwhich he had not yet acknowledged to himself that he had decided</s>  henever had believed that it need come to that but for an instant whenthe president said he could wish him nothing better on his way home thana good railroad accident it flashed upon him that one of the threealternatives before him was to skip</s>  he had the choice to kill himselfwhich was supposed to be the gentlemanly way out of his difficultiesand would leave his family unstained by his crime that matter hadsometimes been discussed in his presence and every one had agreed thatit was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered peopleof money he could not pay back</s>  there was something else that a man ofother instincts and weaker fibre might do and that was to stand histrial for embezzlement and take his punishment</s>  or a man if he wasthat kind of a man could skip</s>  the question with northwick was whetherhe was that kind of man or whether if he skipped he would be thatkind of man whether the skipping would make him that kind of man</s> the question was a cruel one for the selfrespect which he had socuriously kept intact</s>  he had been respectable ever since he was bornif he was born with any instinct it was the instinct of respectabilitythe wish to be honored for what he seemed</s>  it was all the stronger inhim because his father had never had it perhaps an hereditary traitfound expression in him after passing over one generation perhaps anantenatal influence formed him to that type</s>  his mother was alwaysstriving to keep the man she had married worthy of her choice in theeyes of her neighbors but he had never seconded her efforts</s>  he hadbeen educated a doctor but never practised medicine in carrying on thedrug and book business of the village he cared much more for theliterary than the pharmaceutical side of it he liked to have a circleof cronies about the woodstove in his store till midnight and discussmorals and religion with them and one night when denying the plenaryinspiration of the scriptures he went to the wrong jar for aningredient of the prescription he was making up the patient died of hismistake</s>  the disgrace and the disaster broke his wifes heart but helived on to a vague and colorless old age supported by his son in atotal disoccupation</s>  the elder northwick used sometimes to speak of hisson and his success in the world not boastfully but with a certainsarcasm for the source of his bounty as a boy who had alwaysdisappointed him by a narrowness of ambition</s>  he called him milt and hesaid he supposed now milt was the most selfsatisfied man inmassachusetts he implied that there were better things than materialsuccess</s>  he did not say what they were and he could have found very fewpeople in that village to agree with him or to admit that the treasurerof the ponkwasset mills had come in anywise short of the destiny of aman whose father had started him in life with the name of john milton</s> they called him milt too among themselves and perhaps here and therea bolder spirit might have called him so to his face if he had ever comeback to the village</s>  but he had not</s>  he had as they had all heard thatsplendid summer place at hatboro where he spent his time when he wasnot at his house in boston and when they verified the fact of hisimmense prosperity by inquiry of some of the summerfolks who knew himor knew about him they were obscurely flattered by the fact just asmany of us are proud of belonging to a nation in which we are enrichedby the fellowcitizenship of many manifold millionnaires</s>  they did notblame northwick for never coming to see his father or for never havinghim home on a visit they daily saw what old northwick was and howlittle he was fitted for the society of a man whose respectability evenas it was reflected upon them was so dazzling</s>  old northwick had neverdone anything for milt he had never even got along with him the fellowhad left him and made his own way and the old man had no right totalk if milt was ever of a mind to cut off his rations the old manwould soon see</s> iii</s> the local opinion scarcely did justice to old northwicks imperfectdischarge of a fathers duties his critics could not have realized howmuch some capacities if not tastes which northwick had inheritedcontributed to that very effect of respectability which they revered</s> the early range of books the familiarity with the mere exterior ofliterature restricted as it was helped northwick later to pass for aman of education if not of reading with men who were themselves lessread than educated</s>  the people whom his ability threw him with in bostonwere all harvard men and they could not well conceive of anacquaintance so gentlemanly and quiet as northwick who was not collegebred too</s>  by unmistakable signs which we carry through life they knewhe was from the country and they attributed him to a freshwatercollege</s>  they said youre a dartmouth man northwick i believe ori think youre from williams and when northwick said no they forgotit and thought that he was a bowdoin man the impression graduallyfixed itself that he was from one or other of those colleges</s>  it wasbelieved in like manner partly on account of his name that he was fromone of those old ministerial families that you find up in the hillswhere the whole brood study greek while they are sugaring off in thespring and that his own mother had fitted him for college</s>  there wasin fact something clerical in northwicks bearing and it was felt bysome that he had studied for the ministry but had gone into business tohelp his family</s>  the literary phase of the superstition concerning himwas humored by the library which formed such a striking feature of hishouse in boston as well as his house in hatboro at hatboro it wasreally vast and was so charming and so luxurious that it gave the ideaof a cultivated family they preferred to live in it and rarely usedthe drawingroom which was much smaller and was a gold and whitesanctuary on the north side of the house only opened when there was alarge party of guests for dancing</s>  most people came and went withoutseeing it and it remained shut up as much a conjecture as the memoryof northwicks wife</s>  she was supposed to have been taken from him earlyto save him and his children from the mortifying consequences of one ofthose romantic loveaffairs in which a conscientious man had sacrificedhimself to a girl he was certain to outgrow</s>  none of his world knew thathis fortunes had been founded upon the dowry she brought him and uponthe stay her belief in him had always been</s>  she was a churchmember assuch women usually are but northwick was really her religion and asthere is nothing that does so much to sanctify a deity as the blinddevotion of its worshippers northwick was rendered at times worthy ofher faith by the intensity of it</s>  in his sort he returned her love hewas not the kind of man whose affections are apt to wander perhapsbecause they were few and easily kept together perhaps because he wasreally principled against letting them go astray</s>  he was not merely truein a passive way but he was constant in the more positive fashion</s>  whenthey began to get on in the world and his business talent brought himinto relations with people much above them socially he yielded to hershrinking from the opportunities of social advancement that opened tothem and held aloof with her</s>  this kept him a country person in hisexperiences much longer than he need have remained and tended to thatsort of defensive secretiveness which grew more and more upon him andqualified his conduct in matters where there was no question of hisknowledge of the polite world</s>  it was not until after his wifes deathand until his daughters began to grow up into the circles where hismoney and his business associations authorized them to move that hebegan to see a little of that world</s>  even then he left it chiefly to hischildren for himself he continued quite simply loyal to his wifesmemory and apparently never imagined such a thing as marrying again</s> he rose from the chair where he had sat looking up into her picturedface and went to open the safe near the window</s>  but he stopped instooping over to work the combination and glanced out across hisshoulder into the night</s>  the familiar beauty of the scene tempted him tothe window for what all at once he felt might be his last look thoughthe next instant he was able to argue the feeling down and make hismeditated act work into his schemes of early retrieval and honorablereturn</s>  he must have been thinking there before the fire a long timefor now the moon had risen and shone upon the black bulk of firs to thesouthward and on the group of outbuildings</s>  these were in a sort themechanism that transacted the life of his house ministering to all itsnecessities and pleasures</s>  under the conservatories with their longstretches of glass catching the moons rays like levels of water wasthe steam furnace that imparted their summer climate through heavymains carried below the basement to every chamber of the mansion aragged plume of vapor escaped from the tall chimney above them anddishevelled itself in diaphanous silver on the nightbreeze</s>  beyond thehothouses lay the cold graperies and off to the left rose the stablesin a cosy nook of this low mass northwick saw the lights of thecoachmans familyrooms beyond the stables were the cowbarn and thedairy with the farmers cottage it was a sort of joke with northwicksbusiness friends that you could buy butter of him sometimes at less thanhalf it cost him and the joke flattered northwicks sense of baronialconsequence with regard to his place</s>  it was really a farm in extentand it was mostly a grazing farm his cattle were in the herdbooks andhe raised horses which he would sell now and then to a friend theywere so distinctly varied from the original stock as to form almost abreed of themselves they numbered scores in his stalls and pastures</s> the whole group of the buildings was so great that it was like a sort ofcommunal village</s>  in the silent moonlight northwick looked at it as ifit were an expansion or extension of himself so personally did it seemto represent his tastes and so historical was it of the ambitions ofhis whole life he realized that it would be like literally tearinghimself from it when he should leave it</s>  that would be the real panghis children could come to him but not his home</s>  but he remindedhimself that he was going only for a time until he could rehabilitatehimself and come back upon the terms he could easily make when once hewas on his feet again</s>  he thought how fortunate it was that in themeanwhile this property could not be alienated how fortunate it wasthat he had originally deeded it to his wife in the days when he had thefull right to do so and she had willed it to their children by aperfect entail</s>  the horses and the cattle might go and probably mustgo and he winced to think of it but the land and the houseall butthe furniture and pictureswere the childrens and could not betouched</s>  the pictures were his and would have to go with the horses andcattle but ten or twelve thousand dollars would replace them and hemust add that sum to his other losses and bear it as well as he could</s> after all when everything was said and done he was the chief loser</s>  ifhe was a thief as that man said he could show that he had robbedhimself of two dollars for every dollar that he had robbed anybody elseof if now he was going to add to his theft by carrying off thefortythree thousand dollars of the companys which he found himselfpossessed of it was certainly not solely in his own interest</s>  it was tobe the means of recovering all that had gone before it and that thevery men whom it would enable him to repay finally in full supposed itto have gone with</s> northwick felt almost a glow of pride in clarifying this point to hisreason</s>  the additional theft presented itself almost in the light of aduty it really was his duty to make reparation to those he had injuredif he had injured any one and it was his first duty to secure the meansof doing it</s>  if that money which it might almost be said was leftprovidentially in his hands were simply restored now to the company itwould do comparatively no good at all and would strip him of every hopeof restoring the whole sum he had borrowed</s>  he arrived at that wordagain and reinforced by it he stooped again to work the combination ofhis safe and make sure of the money which he now felt an insanenecessity of laying his hands on but he turned suddenly sick with asickness at the heart or at the stomach and he lifted himself and tooka turn about the room</s> he perceived that in spite of the outward calm which it had surprisedhim to find in himself he was laboring under some strong inward stressand he must have relief from it if he was to carry this businessthrough</s>  he threw up the window and stood with his hand on the sashquivering in the strong inrush of the freezing air</s>  but it strengthenedhim and when he put down the window after a few moments his faintnesspassed altogether</s>  still he thought he would not go through thatbusiness at once there was time enough he would see his girls and tellthem that he was obliged to leave by an early train in the morning</s> he took off his shoes and put on his slippers and his housecoat andwent to the stairlanding outside and listened to the voices in thelibrary below</s>  he could hear only womens voices and he inferred thatthe young man who had been dining with his daughters was gone</s>  he wentback into his bedroom and looked at the face of an unmasked thief inhis glass</s>  it was not to get that aspect of himself though that helooked it was to see if he was pale or would seem ill to his children</s> iv</s> northwick was fond of both his daughters

out of the room</s>  she stopped to throw him a kiss from thedoor</s> there</s>  said adeline</s>  i didnt mean to let mrs</s>  wilmington slip outshe cant bear the name and i know it drove her away</s>  but you mustntlet it worry you father</s>  i guess its all going well now</s> whats going well</s>  northwick asked vaguely</s> the jack wilmington business</s>  i know shes really given him up at lastand we cant be too thankful for that much if its no more</s>  i dontbelieve hes bad for all the talk about him but hes been weak andthats a thing she couldnt forgive in a man shes so strong herself</s> northwick did not think of wilmington he thought of himself and in thedepths of his guilty soul in those secret places underneath all hispretences where he really knew himself a thief he wondered if hischilds strength would be against her forgiving his weakness</s>  what wegreatly dread we most unquestioningly believe and it did not occur tohim to ask whether impatience with weakness was a necessary inferencefrom strength</s>  he only knew himself to be miserably weak</s> he rose and stood a moment by the mantel with his impassive handsomeface turned toward his daughter as if he were going to speak to her</s>  hewas a tall man rather thin he was clean shaven except for the grayishwhiskers just forward of his ears and on a line with them he had aregular profile which was more attractive than the expression of hisdirect regard</s>  he took up a crystal ball that lay on the marble andlooked into it as if he were reading his future in its lucid depths andthen put it down again with an effect of helplessness</s>  when he spokeit was not in connection with what his daughter had been talking about</s> he said almost dryly i think i will go up and look over some papers ihave to take with me and then try to get a little sleep before istart</s> and when shall we expect you back</s>  asked his daughter submissivelyaccepting his silence concerning her sisters love affairs</s>  she knewthat it meant acquiescence in anything that sue and she thought best</s> i dont know exactly i cant say now</s>  goodnight</s> to her surprise he came up and kissed her his caresses were for sueand she expected them no more than she invited them</s>  why father</s>  shesaid in a pleased voice</s> let james pack the small bag for me and send elbridge to me in aboutan hour he said as he went out into the hall</s> v</s> northwick was now fiftynine years old but long before he reached thisage he had seen many things to make him doubt the moral government ofthe universe</s>  his earliest instruction had been such as we all receive</s> he had been taught to believe that there was an overruling power whichwould punish him if he did wrong and reward him if he did right orwould at least be displeased in one case and pleased in the other</s> the precept took primarily the monitory form and first enforced thefact of the punishment or the displeasure there were times when thereward or the pleasure might not sensibly follow upon good behavior butevil behavior never escaped the just consequences</s>  this was the doctrinewhich framed the mans intention if not his conduct of life andcontinued to shape it years after experience of the world andespecially of the business world had gainsaid it</s>  he had seen a greatmany cases in which not only good behavior had apparently failed of itsreward but bad behavior had failed of its punishment</s>  in the case of badbehavior his observation had been that no unhappiness not even anydiscomfort came from it unless it was found out for the most part itwas not found out</s>  this did not shake northwicks principles he stillintended to do right so as to be on the safe side even in a remote andimprobable contingency but it enabled him to compromise with hisprinciples and to do wrong provisionally and then repair the wrongbefore he was found out or before the overruling power noticed him</s> but now there were things that made him think in the surprising miseryof being found out that this power might have had its eye upon him allthe time and was not sleeping or gone upon a journey as he hadtacitly flattered himself</s>  it seemed to him that there was even adramatic contrivance in the circumstances to render his anguishexquisite</s>  he had not read many books but sometimes his daughters madehim go to the theatre and once he had seen the play of macbeth</s>  thepeople round him were talking about the actor who played the part ofmacbeth but northwick kept his mind critically upon the play and itseemed to him false to what he had seen of life in having all thosethings happen just so to fret the conscience and torment the soul ofthe guilty man he thought that in reality they would not have beenquite so pat it gave him rather a low opinion of shakespeare lowerthan he would have dared to have if he had been a more cultivated man</s> now that play came back into his mind and he owned with a pang that itwas all true</s>  he was being quite as aptly visited for his transgressionhis heart was being wrung too by the very things that could hurt itmost</s>  he had not been very well of late and was not feeling physicallystrong his anxieties had preyed upon him and he had never felt theneed of the comfort and quiet of his home so much as now when he wasforced to leave it</s>  never had it all been so precious never had thebeauty and luxury of it seemed so great</s>  all that was nothing thoughto the thought of his children especially of that youngest child whomhis heart was so wrapt up in and whom he was going to leave to shameand ruin</s>  the words she had spoken from her pride in him her ignorantcensure of that drunkard as a man who had better die since he hadbecome nothing but a burden and disgrace to his family stung on as ifby incessant repetition</s>  he had crazy thoughts impulses fantasies inwhich he swiftly dreamed renunciation of escape</s>  then he knew that itwould not avail anything to remain it would not avail anything even todie nothing could avail anything at once but in the end his goingwould avail most</s>  he must go it would break the childs heart to facehis shame and she must face it</s>  he did not think of his eldestdaughter except to think that the impending disaster could not affecther so ruinously</s> my god my god</s>  he groaned as he went up stairs</s>  adeline called fromthe room he had left did you speak father</s> he had a conscience that mechanical conscience which becomes so activein times of great moral obliquity against telling a little lie andsaying he had not spoken</s>  he went on up stairs without answeringanything</s>  he indulged the self pity a little longer of feeling himselfan old man forced from his home and he had a blind reasonlessresentment of the behavior of the men who were driving him away andwhose interests even at that moment he was mindful of</s>  but he threwoff this mood when he entered his room and settled himself to business</s> there was a good deal to be done in the arrangement of papers for hisindefinite absence and he used the same care in providing for someminor contingencies in the companys affairs as in leaving instructionsto his children for their action until they should hear from him again</s> afterwards this curious scrupulosity became a matter of comment amongthose privy to it some held it another proof of the ingrained rascalityof the man a trick to suggest lenient construction of his generalconduct in the management of the companys finances others saw in it aninteresting example of the involuntary operation of business instinctswhich persisted at a juncture when the man might be supposed to havebeen actuated only by the most intensely selfish motives</s> the question was not settled even in the final retrospect when itappeared that at the very moment that northwick showed himself mindfulof the companys interests on those minor points he was defrauding itfurther in the line of his defalcations and keeping back a large sum ofmoney that belonged to it</s>  but at that moment northwick did not considerthat this money necessarily belonged to the company any more than hisdaughters house and farm belonged to it</s>  to be sure it was the fruit ofmoney he had borrowed or taken from the company and had used in anenormously successful deal but the company had not earned it and indriving him into a corner in forcing him to make instant restitution ofall its involuntary loans it was justifying him in withholding thispart of them</s>  northwick was a man of too much sense to reason explicitlyto this effect but there was a sophistry tacitly at work in him tothis effect which made it possible for him to go on and steal morewhere he had already stolen so much</s>  in fact it presented the furthertheft as a sort of duty</s>  this sum large as it was really amounted tonothing in comparison with the sum he owed the company but it formedhis only means of restitution and if he did not take it and use it tothat end he might be held recreant to his moral obligations</s>  hecontended from that vestibule of his soul where he was not a thiefwith that self of his inmost where he was a thief that it was all mostfortunate if not providential as it had fallen out</s>  not only had hisbroker sent him that large check for his winnings in stocks the daybefore but northwick had contrary to his custom cashed the check andput the money in his safe instead of banking it</s>  now he could perceive aleading in the whole matter though at the time it seemed a flagrantdefiance of chance and a sort of invitation to burglars</s>  he seemed tohimself like a burglar when he had locked the doors and pulled down thecurtains and stood before the safe working the combination</s>  hetrembled and when at last the mechanism announced its effect with aslight click of the withdrawing bolt he gave a violent start</s>  at thesame time there came a rough knock at the door and northwick called outin the choking incoherent voice of one suddenly roused from sleephello</s>  whos there</s>  what is it</s> its me said elbridge</s> oh yes</s>  well</s>  all right</s>  hold on a minute</s>  ahyou can come back inten or fifteen minutes</s>  im not quite ready for you yet</s>  northwickspoke the first broken sentences from the safe where he stood in afrenzy of dismay the more collected words were uttered from his deskwhere he ran to get his pistol</s>  he did not know why he thought elbridgemight try to force his way in perhaps it was because any presence onthe outside of the door would have terrified him</s>  he had time torecognize that he was not afraid for the money but that he was afraidfor himself in the act of taking it</s> elbridge gave a cough on the other side of the door and said with alittle hesitation all right and northwick heard him tramp away andgo down stairs</s> he went back to the safe and pulled open the heavy door whoseresistance helped him shake off his nervousness</s>  then he took the moneyfrom the drawer where he had laid it counted it slipped it into theinner pocket of his waistcoat and buttoned it in there</s>  he shut thesafe and locked it</s>  the succession of these habitual acts calmed himmore and more and after he had struck a match and kindled the fire onhis hearth which he had hitherto forgotten he was able to settle againto his preparations in writing</s> vi</s> when elbridge came back northwick called out come in</s>  and then wentand unlocked the door for him</s>  i forgot it was locked he saidcarelessly</s>  do you think the colts going to be lame</s> well i dont like the way she behaves very well</s>  them shoes have gotto come off</s>  elbridge stood at the corner of the desk and diffused astrong smell of stable through the hot room</s> youll see to it of course said northwick</s>  im going away in themorning and i dont know just how long i shall be gone</s>  northwicksatisfied his mechanical scruple against telling a lie by this formulaand in its shelter he went on to give elbridge instructions about themanagement of the place in his absence</s>  he took some money from hispocketbook and handed it to him for certain expenses and then he saidi want to take the five oclock train that reaches ponkwasset at nine</s> you can drive me up with the black mare</s> all right said elbridge but his tone expressed a shadow ofreluctance that did not escape northwick</s> anything the matter</s>  he asked</s> i dunno</s>  our little boy dont seem to be very well</s> what ails him</s>  asked northwick with the sympathy it was a relief forhim to feel</s> well dr</s>  morrells just been there and hes afraid its themembranous crou the last letter stuck in elbridges throat he gulpedit down</s> oh i hope not said northwick</s> hes comin back againhe had to go off to another placebut i couldsee twant no use said elbridge with patient despair he had gothimself in hand again and spoke clearly</s> northwick shrank back from the shadow sweeping so near him a shadowthrown from the skies no doubt but terrible in its blackness on theearth</s>  why of course you mustnt think of leaving your wife</s>  you musttelephone simpson to come for me</s> all right</s>  elbridge took himself away</s> northwick watched him across the icy stableyard going to thecoachmans quarters in that cosy corner of the spreading barn thewindows were still as cheerily bright with lamplight as when they strucka pang of dumb envy to northwicks heart</s>  the childs sickness must havebeen very sudden for his daughters not to have known of it</s>  he thoughthe ought to call adeline and send her in there to those poor peoplebut he reflected that she could do no good and he spared her theuseless pain she would soon need all her strength for herself</s>  histhought returned to his own cares from which the trouble of another hadlured it for a moment</s>  but when he heard the doctors sleighbells clashinto the stableyard he decided to go himself and show the interest hisfamily ought to feel in the matter</s> no one answered his knock at elbridges door and he opened it and foundhis way into the room where elbridge and his wife were with the doctor</s> the little boy had started up in his crib and was struggling with hisarms thrown wildly about</s> there</s>  there hes got another of them chokin spells</s>  screamed themother</s>  elbridge newton aint you goin to do anything</s>  oh help himsave him dr</s>  morrell</s>  oh i should think youd be ashamed to let himsuffer so</s>  she sprang upon the child and caught him from the doctorshands and turned him this way and that trying to ease him he wassuddenly quiet and she said there i just knew i could do it</s>  whatare you big strong men good for any she looked down at the childsface in her arms and then up at the doctors and she gave a wildscreech like the cry of one in piercing torment</s> it turned northwick heartsick</s>  he felt himself worse than helplessthere but he went to the farmers house and told the farmers wife togo over to the newtons their little boy had just died</s>  he heard hercoming before he reached his own door and when he reached his room heheard the bells of the doctors sleigh clashing out of the avenue</s> the voice and the look of that childless mother haunted him</s>  she hadbeen one of the hatshop hands a flighty nervous thing madly in lovewith elbridge whom she ruled with a sort of frantic devotion sincetheir marriage compensating his cool quiet with a perpetual flutter ofexaggerated sensibilities in every direction</s>  but somehow she had putnorthwick in mind of his own mother and he thought of the chance or thewill that had bereaved one and spared the other and he envied thelittle boy who had just died</s> he considered the case of the parents who would want to make fulloutward show of their grief and he wrote elbridge a note to be givenhim in the morning and enclosed one of the bills he was taking from thecompany he hoped elbridge would accept it from him towards the expenseshe must meet at such a time</s> then he wheeled his chair about to the fire and stretched his legs outto get what rest he could before the hour of starting</s>  he would haveliked to go to bed but he was afraid of oversleeping himself in caseelbridge had neglected to telephone simpson</s>  but he did not believe thispossible and he had smoothly confided himself to his experience ofelbridges infallibility when he started awake at the sound of bellsbefore the front door and then the titter of the electric bell over hisbed in the next room</s>  he thought it was an officer come to arrest himbut he remembered that only his household was acquainted with the use ofthat bell and then he wondered that simpson should have found it out</s> he put on his overcoat and arctics and caught up his bag and hurrieddown stairs and out of doors</s>  it was elbridge who was waiting for him onthe threshold and took his bag from him</s> why</s>  wheres simpson</s>  he asked</s>  couldnt you get him</s> its all right said elbridge opening the door of the booby andgently bundling northwick into it</s>  i could come justs easy as not</s>  ithought youd ride better in the booby its a little mite chilly forthe cutter</s>  the stars seemed points of ice in the freezing sky thebroken snow clinked like charcoal around elbridges feet</s>  he shut thebooby door and then came back and opened it slightly</s>  i want agointo let no simpson carry you to no train noway</s> the tears came into northwicks eyes and he tried to say why thankyou elbridge but the door shut upon his failure and elbridge mountedto his place and drove away</s>  northwick had been able to get out of hishouse only upon condition that he should behave as if he were going tobe gone on an ordinary journey</s>  he had to keep the same terms withhimself on the way to the station</s>  when he got out there he said toelbridge ive left a note for you on my desk</s>  im sorry to be leavinghomeat such a timewhen youveyoull telegraph when to meet you</s>  elbridge suggested</s> yes said northwick</s>  he went inside the station which was deliciouslywarm from the large register in the centre of the room and brilliantlylighted in readiness for the train now almost due</s>  the closing of thedoor behind northwick roused a little black figure drooping forward onthe benching in one corner</s>  it was the drunken lawyer</s>  there had beensome displeasures general and personal between the two men and theydid not speak but now at sight of northwick putney came forward andfixed him severely with his eye</s> northwick</s>  do you know who you tried to drive over last evening</s> northwick returned his regard with the halfironical halfpatronizinglook a dull man puts on with a person of less fortune but more brain</s>  ididnt see you mr</s>  putney until i was quite upon you</s>  the horsesit was the law you tried to drive over</s>  thundered the little man witha voice out of keeping with his slender body</s>  dont try it too often</s> you cant drive over the law yetyou havent quite millions enoughfor that</s>  heigh</s>  that so</s>  he queried sensible of the anticlimax ofasking such a question in that way but tipsily helpless in it</s> northwick did not answer he walked to the other end of the station setoff for ladies and putney did not follow him</s>  the train came in andnorthwick went out and got aboard</s> vii</s> the president of the board who had called northwick a thief and yethad got him a chance to make himself an honest man was awake at thehour the defaulter absconded after passing quite as sleepless a night</s> he had kept a dinner engagement hoping to forget northwick but heseemed to be eating and drinking him at every course</s>  when he came hometoward eleven oclock he went to his library and sat down before thefire</s>  his wife had gone to bed and his son and daughter were at a balland he sat there alone smoking impatiently</s> he told the man who looked in to see if he wanted anything that he mightgo to bed he need not sit up for the young people</s>  hilary had that kindof consideration for servants and he liked to practise it he liked torealize that he was practising it now in a moment when every habit ofhis life might very well yield to the great and varying anxieties whichbeset him</s> he had an ideal of conduct of what was due from him to himself as agentleman and a citizen and he could not conceal from himself that hehad been mainly instrumental in the escape of a rogue from justice whenhe got the board to give northwick a chance</s>  his ideals had not hithertostood in the way of his comfort his entire repose of mind any morethan they had impaired his prosperity though they were of a kind farabove those which commercial honor permits a man to be content with</s>  heheld himself bound as a man of a certain origin and social traditionto have public spirit and he had a great deal of it</s>  he believed thathe owed it to the community to do nothing to lower its standards ofpersonal integrity and responsibility and he distinguished himself by agratified consciousness from those people of chromomorality who heldall sorts of loose notions on such points</s>  his name stood not merely forso much money many names stood for far more but it meant reliabilityit meant honesty it meant good faith</s>  he really loved these thingsthough no doubt he loved them less for their own sake than becausethey were spiritual properties of eben hilary</s>  he did not expecteverybody else to have them but his theory of life exacted that theyshould be held the chief virtues</s>  he was so conscious of their valuethat he ignored all those minor qualities in himself which rendered himnot only bearable but even lovable he was not aware of having any sortof foibles so that any error of conduct in himself surprised him evenmore than it pained him</s>  it was not easy to recognize it but when heonce saw it he was not only willing but eager to repair it</s> the error that he had committed in northwicks case if it was an errorwas one that presented peculiar difficulties as every error in lifedoes the errors love an infinite complexity of disguise and masqueradeas all sorts of things</s>  there were moments when hilary saw his mistakeso clearly that it seemed to him nothing less than the repayment ofnorthwicks thefts from his own pocket would satisfy the claims ofjustice to his fellowlosers if northwick ran away and then again itlooked like the act of wise mercy which it had appeared to him when hewas urging the board to give the man a chance as the only thing whichthey could hopefully do in the circumstances as common sense asbusiness</s>  but it was now so obvious that a man like northwick could andwould do nothing but run away if he were given the chance that heseemed to have been his accomplice when he used the force of hispersonal character with them in northwicks behalf</s>  he was in aridiculous position there was no doubt of that and he was not going toget out of it without much painful wear and tear of pride ofselfrespect</s> after a long time he looked at the clock and found it still early forthe return of his young people</s>  he was impatient to see his son and toget the situation in the light of his mind and see how it looked there</s> he had already told him of the defalcation and of what the board haddecided to do with northwick but this was while he was still in theglow of action and he had spoken very hurriedly with matt who came injust as he was going out to dinner it was before his cold fit came on</s> he had reached that time of life when a man likes to lay his troublesbefore his son and in the view his son usually took of his troubleshilary seemed to find another mood of his own</s>  it was a fresherdifferent self dealing with them for the fellow was not only youngerand more vigorous he was another temperament with the same interestsand often the same principles</s>  he had disappointed hilary in some waysbut he had gratified his pride in the very ways he had disappointed him</s> the father had expected the son to go into business and matt did gointo the mills at ponkwasset where he was to be superintendent in thenatural course</s>  but one day he came home and told his father that he hadbegun to have his doubts of the existing relations of labor and capitaland until he could see his way clearer he would rather give up hischance with the company</s>  it was a keen disappointment to hilary he madeno concealment of that but he did not quarrel with his son about it</s>  herobustly tolerated matts queer notions not only because he was afather who blindly doted on his children and behaved as if everythingthey did was right no matter if it put him in the wrong but because hechose to respect the fellows principles if those were his principles</s> he had his own principles and matt should have his if he liked</s>  he boreentirely well the purpose of going abroad that matt expressed and hewished to give him much more money than the fellow would take to carryon those researches which he made in his travels</s>  when he came back andpublished his monograph on work and wages in europe hilary paid theexpense and took as unselfish an interest in the slow and meagre saleof the little book as if it had cost him nothing</s> eben hilary had been a crank too in his day so far as to have gonecounter to the most respectable feeling of business in boston when hecame out an abolitionist</s>  his individual impulse to radicalism hadexhausted itself in that direction we are each of us good for only acertain degree of advance in opinion few men are indefinitelyprogressive and hilary had not caught on to the movement that wascarrying his son with it</s>  but he understood how his son should be whathe was and he loved him so much that he almost honored him for what hecalled his balderdash about industrial slavery</s>  his heart lifted when atlast he heard the scratching of the nightlatch at the door below andhe made lumbering haste down stairs to open and let the young people in</s> he reached the door as they opened it and in the momentary lightness ofhis soul at sight of his children he gave them a gay welcome and tookhis daughter all a fluff of soft silken and furry wraps into his arms</s> oh dont kiss my nose</s>  she called out</s>  itll freeze you to deathpapa</s>  what in the world are you up for</s>  anything the matter withmamma</s> no</s>  she was in bed when i came

her longgloved hands well in over the fire on thehearth while she lifted her eyes to the clock</s>  oh it isnt so verylate</s>  only five</s> no its early said her father with the security in a feeble jokewhich none but fathers can feel with none but their grownup daughters</s> its full an hour yet before matt would be getting up to feed hiscattle if he were in vardley</s>  hilary had given matt the old familyplace there and he always liked to make a joke of his getting an honestliving by farming it</s> dont speak of that agricultural angel</s>  said the girl putting herdraperies back with

put this tentatively and his son responded i suppose thatnaturally inclines you to suppose hell run away</s> yes</s> but your supposition doesnt establish the fact</s> no</s>  but the question is whether it doesnt oblige me to act as if ithad whether i oughtnt if ive got this suspicion to take some stepsat once to find out whether northwicks really gone or not and to mixmyself actively up in

only got your fears for evidence and you must all have had yourfears before</s>  i dont think that even a bad conscience ought to hurryone into the catchpole business</s>  matt laughed again with that fondnesshe had for his father</s>  though as for any peculiar disgrace incatchpoles as catchpoles i dont see it</s>  theyre a necessary part ofthe administration of justice as we understand it and have it and idont see how a detective who arrests say a murderer is not asrespectably employed as the judge who sentences him or the hangman whoputs the rope round his neck</s>  the distinction we

for lettin arty get out into the stableamong the horses but i guess he wont be troubled that way muchmore said the mother and then something in miss northwicks faceseemed to stay her in her wild talk

when did he say he would be back</s> well he said he couldnt say exactly</s>  but i understood in a day ortwo</s> did he expect to be anywhere but ponkwasset</s> no maam i didnt hear him say as he did</s> then its a mistake and of course i knew it was a mistake</s>  theresmore than one northwick in the world i presume</s>  she laughed a littlehysterically she had a newspaper in her hand and it shook with thenervous tremor that passed over her</s> why what is it miss northwick</s>  said elbridge with a perception ofthe trouble in her voice through the trouble in his own heart</s>  hestopped pulling the greasy sponge over the trace in his hand and turnedtowards her</s> oh nothing</s>  theres been an accident on the union and dominionrailroad and of course its a mistake</s> she handed him the paper folded to the column which she wished to showand he took it between two fingertips so as to soil it as little aspossible and stood reading it</s>  she went on saying he wouldnt be onthe train if he was at ponkwasset i got the paper when i first camedown stairs but i didnt happen to read the account till just now andthen i thought id run out and see what father said to you about wherehe was going</s>  he told us he was going to the mills too and hervoice growing more and more wistful died away in the fascination ofwatching the fascination of elbridge as he first took in the halfcolumnof scareheads and then followed down to the meagre details of thedispatch eked out with doubleleading to cover space</s> it appeared that the northern express had reached wellwater junction

you cant help that and as long as it aint the initials andyou know your father is safe and sound at the mills you dont want toworry</s> no said adeline</s>  youre sure he told you he was going to the mills</s> why didnt he tell you he was</s>  i dont recollect just what he said</s> but he told me about that note he left for me and that had the money init for the funal elbridge stopped for a moment

thewestern union operator at the station</s>  he had the usual telephoniccontention with her as to who he was and what he wanted but he got herat last to take his dispatch to ponkwasset falls asking

trouble you with my foolishness wheni guess you neednt mind about that said elbridge</s>  i guess itwouldnt make much difference to me if the whole world was burnt up</s>  bea kind of a relief</s>  he did not mean just the sense the words conveyedand she in her preoccupation with her own anxiety and her pity forhim interpreted them aright</s> she stayed to add i dont know what he could have been on

admitted</s>  dont speak to anybody about it tillyou hear</s>  she knew from his making no answer that he would obey herand she hid the paper in her pocket as if she would hide theintelligence it bore

early</s>  elbridges sympathetic incredulity hadcomforted her if it had not convinced her and she possessed herself insuch patience as she could till the answer should come from the mills</s> if her father were there then it would be all right and in themeantime she found some excuses for not believing the worst she feared</s> there was no reason in the world why he should be on that train

with the telegraph and telephone connections betweenhatboro and ponkwasset and adeline had to go to the funeral without ananswer to elbridges message</s>  below her surface interest in the ceremonyand the behavior of the mourners and the friends which nothing couldhave alienated but the actual presence of calamity she had a nethermisery of alternating hope and fear of anxieties continually reasoneddown and of security lost the instant it was found</s>  the double straintold so upon her nerves that when the rites at the grave were endedshe sent word to the clergyman and piteously begged him to drive homewith her</s> why arent you well miss northwick</s>  he asked with a glance at hertroubled face as he got into the covered sleigh with her</s> oh yes she said and she flung herself back against the cushioningand began to cry</s> poor mrs</s>  newtons grief has been very trying he said gently andwith a certain serenity of smile he had and he added as if he thoughtit well to lure

havehave you seenthepaper this morning</s> it came said the clergyman</s>  but in view of the duty before me ithought i wouldnt read it</s>  is there anything particular in it</s> no nothing</s>

down in the effort to go on</s>  and i wanted to have youseesee she stopped and handed him the paper</s> he took it and ran over the account of the accident and came at hertrouble with an instant

it</s>  he went up to the mills yesterday morning and he couldnthave been on the train at all</s>  only the nameit isnt quite the name said wade with a gentle moderation as if hewould not willingly

till weoh very willingly</s>  on the way the young clergyman talked of theaccident guessing that her hysterical conjectures had heightened thehorror and that he should make it less dreadful by exploring its factswith her</s>  he did not declare it impossible her father should have beenon the train but he urged the extreme improbability</s> elbridge and his wife passed them driving rapidly in simpsons boobywhich adeline had ordered for their use at the funeral and when she gotinto the house elbridge was waiting there for her</s>  he began at oncemiss northwick i dont believe but what

the rush of the cold airbegan to revive her</s>  she opened her eyes and suzette said severelywhat has come over you adeline</s>  arent you well</s>  and as adelineanswered nothing she went on i dont

have stopped over at springfield oryes adeline admitted thats what elbridge thought</s> or he may have gone on to willoughby junction</s>  he often goes there</s> that is true said the other suffering

bring us tea here</s>  i shall telegraph to the mills again andi shall telegraph to mr</s>  hilary in boston he will know whether fatherwas going anywhere else</s>  they had a meeting of the board day beforeyesterday and father went to the mills unexpectedly</s>  i shall telegraphto ponkwasset junction too and you may be sure i shall not come homeadeline till i know something definite</s> the tea

neednt beanxious</s>  i shall do very well now</s>  yes</s>  i shall</s> she begged him to leave her but he perceived that she did not reallywish him to go and it was nearly an hour after suzette drove awaybefore he got out of the house</s>  he would not let her send him home andhe walked toward the village in the still sunny cold of the earlywinter afternoon thinking of the sort of contempt with which that girlhad spurned the notion of calamity as if it were something to beresented and even snubbed in its approach to her</s>  it was as if she hadnow gone to trace it to its source and defy it there to stamp upon thepresumptuous rumor and destroy it</s> just before he reached the crest of the upland that shut out the villagefrom him he heard the clash of sleighbells a pair of horses leapedinto sight and came bearing down upon him with that fine throw of theirfeet which you get only in such a direct encounter</s>  he stepped into theside track and then he heard miss sue northwick call to her horses andsaw her pulling them up</s>  she had her fathers fondness for horses andthe pair of little grays were a gift from him with the picturesquesledge they drew</s>  the dasher swelled forward like a swans breast andthen curved deeply backward from either corner of the band of ironfilagree at the top dangled a red horsetail</s>  the man who had driven herto the station sat in a rumble behind on the seat with suzette wasanother young lady who put out her hand to wade with a look of uncommonliking across the shining bearskin robe and laughed at hisastonishment in seeing her</s>  while they talked the clipped graysnervously lifted and set down their forefeet in the snow as iffingering it they inhaled the cold air with squared nostrils and blewit out in blasts of white steam</s>  suzette said in explanation of herfriends presence louise had seen the account and she made herbrother bring her up</s>  they think just as i do that theres nothing ofit one of the papers had the name nordeck but weve left mr</s>  hilary atthe station fighting the telegraph and telephone in all directions andhe isnt to stop till he gets something positive</s>  hes trying wellwaternow</s>  she said all this very haughtily but she added the only thingis i cant understand why my father hasnt been heard of at the mills</s> some one was asking for him there yesterday</s> probably he went on to willoughby junction as you suggested</s> of course he did said louise</s>  we havent heard from there yet</s> oh im not in the least troubled said sue but its certainly veryprovoking</s>  she lifted her reins</s>  im hurrying home to let adelineknow</s> shell be very glad wade returned as if it were the certainty ofgood news she was carrying</s>  i think ill join matt at the station hesuggested to louise</s> do</s>  she answered</s>  you can certainly manage something between you</s> matt will be almost as glad of your coming as my going</s>  i thought wewere coming up here to reassure sue but i seem strangely superfluous</s> you can reassure adeline said sue</s>  she added to wade i keepthinking what an annoyance it will be to my father to have all thisfuss made over him</s>  i sometimes feel vexed with adeline</s>  goodbye</s>  shecalled back to him as she drove away and she stopped again to addwont you come up with mr</s>  hilary when youve heard somethingdefinite</s> wade promised and they repeated their goodbyes all round with aresolute cheerfulness</s> xii</s> the affair had been mixed up with tea and lunch and there was now thesuggestion of a gay return to the northwick place and an hour or twomore in that pleasant company of pretty and lively women which wadeloved almost as well as he loved righteousness</s>  he knew that there wassuch a thing as death in the world he had often already seen itsstrange peaceful face he had just stood by an open grave but at themoment his youth denied it all and he swung along over the hardpackedroadway thinking of the superb beauty of suzette northwick and thewitchery of louise hilarys face</s>  it was like her to come at once toher friend in this anxiety and he believed a strength in her to helpbear the worst the worst that now seemed so remote and impossible</s> he did not find matt hilary in the station but he pushed through to theplatform outside and saw him at a little distance standing between twoof the tracks and watching a group of men there who were replacing somewornout rails with new ones</s> matt</s>  he called to him and matt turned about and said hellocaryl</s>  and yielded him a sort of absentminded hand while he kept hisface turned smilingly upon the men</s>  some were holding the rails inposition and another was driving in the spike that was to rivet theplate to the sleeper</s>  he struck it with exquisite accuracy from a widefreehanded rhythmical swing of his hammer</s> beautiful</s>  isnt it</s>  said matt</s>  i never see any sort of manual laboreven the kinds that are brutified and demoralized by their associationwith machinery without thinking how far the arts still come short ofthe trades</s>  if any sculptor could feel it

themoment</s>  then you dont share miss northwicks anxiety about herfather he began as if matt had been dealing directly with thatmatter and had been giving his reasons for not being troubled about it</s> have you heard any thing yet</s>  but of course you havent ormatt halted him and looked down into his face from his greater heightwith a sort of sobered cheerfulness</s>  how much do you know about missnorthwicks father</s> very littlenothing in fact but what she and her sister showed me inthe morning paper</s>  i know theyre in great distress about him i justmet miss suzette and your sister and they told me i should find you atthe station</s> matt began to walk on again</s>  i didnt know but you had heard some talkfrom the outside</s>  i came off to escape the pressure of inquiry at thestation people had found out somehow that i had been put in charge ofthe telegraphing when the young ladies left</s>  i imagined they wouldntfollow me if i went for a walk</s>  he put his hand through wades arm anddirected their course across the tracks toward the street away from thestation where elbridge had walked his horses up and down the evening hemet northwick</s>  i told them to look out for me if they got anything ishould keep in sight somewhere</s>  isnt it a curious commentary on ourstate of things he went on that when any man in a position of trustcant be accounted for twentyfour hours after he leaves home thebusinesslike supposition is that he has run away with money thatdoesnt belong to him</s> what do you mean matt</s> i mean that the popular belief in hatboro seems to be that northwickwas on his way to canada on the train that was wrecked</s> shocking shocking</s>  said wade</s>  what makes you think they believethat</s> the conjecture and speculation began in the station the moment missnorthwick left it and before it could be generally understood that iwas there to represent her</s>  i suppose there wasnt a man among them thatwouldnt have trusted northwick with all he had or wouldnt have feltthat his fortune was made if northwick had taken charge of his money</s>  infact i heard some of them saying so before their deference for me shuttheir mouths</s>  yet i havent a doubt they all think hes an abscondingdefaulter</s> its shocking said wade sadly but im afraid youre right</s>  thesethings are so common that people are subjected to suspicion on no kindof but just at this juncture matt lifted his head from the momentsrevery in which he seemed to have been far absent</s> have you seen much of the family this winter</s> yes a good deal said wade</s>  theyre not communicants but theyvebeen regular attendants at the services and ive been a good deal attheir house</s>  they seem rather lonely they have very little to do withthe south hatboro people and nothing at all with the villagers</s>  idont know why theyve spent the winter here</s>  of course one hears allkinds of gossip</s>  the gossips at south hatboro say that miss suzette waswilling to be on with young wilmington again and that she kept thefamily here</s>  but i place no faith in such a conjecture</s> it has a rustic crudity said matt</s>  but if jack wilmington ever caredanything for the girl nows his chance to be a man and stand by her</s> something in matts tone made wade stop and ask what do you meanmatt</s>  is there anything besidesyes</s>  matt took a fresh grip of his friends arm and walked himsteadily forward and kept him walking in spite of his involuntarytendency to come to a halt every few steps and try to urge somethingthat he never quite got from his tongue against the probability of whatmatt was saying</s>  i mean that these people are right in theirsuspicions</s> right</s> my dear caryl there is no doubt whatever that northwick is a defaulterto the company in a very large amount</s>  it came out at a meeting of thedirectors on monday</s>  he confessed it for he could not deny it in theface of the proof against him and he was given a number of days to makeup his shortage</s>  he was released on parole it was really the bestthing the wisest as well as the mercifullest and of course he brokehis word and seized the first chance to run away</s>  i knew all about thedefalcation from my father just after the meeting</s>  there is simply noquestion about it</s> gracious powers</s>  said wade finally helpless to dispute the factswhich he still did not realize</s>  and you think it possibledo yousupposeimaginethat it was really he who was in that burning car</s> what an awful fate</s> an awful fate</s>  asked matt</s>  do you think so</s>  yes yours is the safeground in regard to a thing of that kindthe only ground</s> the only ground</s> i was thinking of my poor father said matt</s> he said some sharp things to that wretched creature at the meeting ofthe boardcalled him a thief and i dare say other hard namesand toldhim that the best thing that could happen to him was a railroad accidenton his way home</s> ah</s> you see</s>  when he read the account of that accident in the paper thismorning and found a name so much like northwicks among the victims hewas fearfully broken up of course</s>  he felt somehow as if he had causedhis deathi could see that though of course he wouldnt admit anythingof the kind</s> of course said wade compassionately</s> i suppose it isnt well to invoke death in any way</s>  he is like thedevil and only too apt to come if you ask for him</s>  i dont meananything superstitious and i dont suppose my father really has anysuperstitious feeling about the matter</s>  but hes been rather afriendor a victimof that damnable theory that the gentlemanly wayout of a difficulty like northwicks is suicide and i suppose he spokefrom association with it or by an impulse from it</s>  he has beentelegraphing right and left to try to verify the reports as it was hisbusiness and duty to do anyway and he caught at the notion of mycoming up here with louise to see if we could be of any use to those twopoor women</s> poor women</s>  wade echoed</s>  the worst must fall upon them as the worstalways seems to do</s> yes wherever a cruel blow falls there seems to be a woman for it tofall on</s>  and you see what a refinement of cruelty this is going to bewhen it reaches them</s>  they have got to know that their father met thatawful death and that he met it because he was a defaulter and wasrunning away</s>  i suppose the papers will be full of it</s> that seems intolerable</s>  couldnt anything be done to stop them</s> why the thing has to come out</s>  you can keep happiness a secret butsorrow and shame have to come outi dont know why but they do</s>  thenwhen they come out we feel as if the means of their publicity were thecause of them</s>  its very unphilosophical</s>  they walked slowly along insilence for a few moments and then matts revery broke out again inwords well its to be seen now whether she has the strength thatbears or the strength that breaks</s>  the way she held her head as shetook the reins and drove off with poor louise beside her palpitatingwith sympathy for her trouble and anxiety about her horses was yes itwas superb theres no other word for it</s>  ah poor girl</s> your sisters presence will be a great help to her said wade</s>  it wasvery good of her to come</s> ah there wasnt anything else for it said matt flinging his headup</s>  louise has my fathers loyalty</s>  i dont know much about herfriendship with miss northwickshes so much younger than i and theycame together when i was abroadbut ive fancied she wasnt much likedamong the girls and louise was her champion in a way</s>  when louise readthat report nothing would do but she must come</s> of course</s> but our being here must have its embarrassments for my father</s>  it was asacrifice for him to let us come</s> i dont understand</s> it was he who carried through the respite the directors gave northwickand now he will have the appearance before some people of helping tocover up the miserable facts of putting a good face on things while arogue was getting away from justice</s>  he might even be supposed to havesome interest in getting him out of the way</s> oh i dont think any such suspicion can attach itself to such a man asmr</s>  hilary said wade with a certain resentment of the suggestion evenfrom the mans son</s> in a commercial civilization like ours any sort of suspicion can attachto any sort of man in a case like this said matt</s> wade took off his hat and wiped his forehead</s>  i cant realize that thecase is what you say</s>  i cant realize it at all</s>  it seems like some poorsort of play of makebelieve</s>  i cant forgive myself for being solittle moved by it</s>  we are in the presence of a horror that ought tomake us uncover our heads and fall to our knees and confess our own sinsto god</s> ah im with you there</s>  said matt and he pushed his hand fartherthrough his friends arm</s> they were both still well under thirty and they both had that zest formere experience any experience that hunger for the knowledge of lifewhich youth feels</s>  in their several ways they were already men who hadthought for themselves or conjectured rather and they were eager toverify their speculations through their emotions</s>  they thought a gooddeal alike in many things though they started from such opposite pointsin their thinking and they both had finally the same ideal of life</s> their intimacy was of as old a date as their school days at harvardthey were in the same clubs as well as the same class</s>  wades father wasnot a boston man but his mother was a bellingham and he was nurturedin the traditions of hilarys social life</s>  both had broken with themwade not so much when he became a ritualist as hilary when he turned hisback on manufacturing</s> they were now not without a kind of pride in standing so close to thecalamity they were fated witnesses of and in the midst of theirsympathy they had a curiosity which concerned itself with one of thevictims because she was a young and beautiful girl</s>  their pity not somuch forgot as ignored northwicks elder daughter who was a plain sickold maid and followed the younger with a kind of shrinking and dread ofher doom which matt tried to put into words</s> i assure you if i couldnt manage to pull away from it at moments idont see how i could stand it</s>  i had a sense of personal disgrace wheni met that poor girl with what i had in my mind</s>  i felt as if i weretaking some base advantage of her in knowing that about her father andi was so glad when she went off with louise and left me to struggle withmy infamous information alone</s>  i hurried louise away with her in themost cowardly haste</s>  we dont any of us realize it as you say</s>  whyjust imagine</s>
 theywill have to leave their house their home she will have to give upeverything to the company</s>  it isnt merely friends and her place in theworld its money its something to eat and wear its a

reach of adisaster like this</s>  it strikes from a coil that seems to involveeverything</s> what are you going to do if you get bad news</s>  asked wade</s> ah i dont know</s>  i must tell her somehow unless you think thatyou wade gave a start which matt interpreted aright he laughednervously</s>  no no</s>  its for me to do it</s>  i know that unless i can getlouise</s>  ah</s>  i wonder what that is</s> they were walking back toward the station again and matt had seen ahead and arm projected from the office window and a hand waving a sheetof yellow paper</s>  it seemed meant for them</s>  they both began to run andthen they checked themselves and walked as fast as they could</s> we must refer the matter to your sister said wade and if she thinksbest remember that i shall be quite ready to speak to miss northwick</s> or if you think best i will speak to her without troubling yoursister</s> oh youre all right wade</s>  you neednt have any doubt of that</s>  wellsee</s>  i wonder what there is in that dispatch</s> the old station master had come out of the station and was hurrying tomeet them with the message now duly enclosed in an envelope</s>  he gave itto matt and promptly turned his back on him</s> matt tore it open and read impossible to identify parlorcarpassengers</s>  the telegram was signed operator and was dated atwellwater</s>  it fell blankly on their tense feeling</s> well said wade after a long breath</s>  it isnt the worst</s> matt read it frowningly over several times then he smiled</s>  oh no</s> this isnt at all bad</s>  its nothing</s>  but so far its rather comforting</s> and its something even if it is nothing</s>  well i suppose id better goup to miss northwick with it</s>  wait a moment i must tell them where tosend if anything else comes</s> ill walk with you as far as st</s>  michaels said wade when they leftthe station</s>  im going to my study there</s> they set off together up the middle of the street which gave them moreelbowroom than the sidewalk narrowly blocked out of the snow</s> from a large store as they were passing a small drylooking pompouslittle man advanced to the middle of the street and stopped them</s>  ibeg your pardon mr</s>  wade</s>  i beg your pardon sir</s>  he said nimblytransferring himself after the quasi selfintroduction from wade tomatt</s>  may i ask whether you have received any further information</s> no said matt amiably the only answer we have got is that it isimpossible to identify the passengers in the parlorcar</s> ah thank you</s>  thank you very much sir</s>  i felt sure it couldnt beour mr</s>  northwick</s>  ergoodmorning sir</s> he bowed himself away and went into his store again and matt askedwade who in the world is that</s> hes a mr</s>  gerrishkeeps the large store there</s>  rather an unpleasanttype</s> matt smiled</s>  he had the effect of refusing to believe that anything solow as an accident could happen to a man of northwicks businessstanding</s> something of that wade assented</s>  he worships northwick on the altarof material success</s> matt lifted his head and looked about</s>  i suppose the whole place issimply seething with curiosity</s> just after they reached the sidestreet where wade left him to go downto his church he met sue northwick driving in her sleigh</s>  she wasalone except for the groom impassive in the rumble</s> have you heard anything</s>  she asked sharply</s> matt repeated the dispatch from the operator at wellwater</s> i knew it was a mistake she said with a kind of resolute scorn</s> its perfectly ridiculous</s>  why should he have been there</s>  i thinkthere ought to be some way of punishing the newspapers for circulatingfalse reports</s>  ive been talking with the man who drove my father to thetrain yesterday morning and he says he spoke lately of buying somehorses at springfield</s>  he got several from a farm near there once</s>  imgoing down to telegraph the farmer i found his name among fathersbills</s>  of course hes there</s>  ive got the dispatch all written out</s> let me take it back to the station for you miss northwick said matt</s> no get in with

tellthem to send it up by simpson the instant the answer comes</s> the irishman said yes maam and dropped from his perch with thepaper in his hand</s> get in mr</s>  hilary she said and after he had mounted she skilfullybacked the sleigh and turned the horses homeward</s>  if i hear nothingfrom my dispatch or if i hear wrong i am going up to wellwaterjunction myself by the first train</s>  i cant wait any longer</s>  if itsthe worst i want to know the worst</s> matt did not know what to say to her courage</s>  so he said alone</s>  togain time</s> of course</s>  at such a time i would rather be alone</s> at the house matt found louise had gone to her room for a moment and hesaid he would like to speak with her there</s> she was lying on the lounge when he announced himself and she saidcome in and explained i just came off a moment to give mysympathies a little rest</s>  and then being up late so many nights thisweek</s>  what have you heard</s> nothing practically</s>  louise how long did you expect to stay</s> i dont know</s>  i hadnt thought</s>  as long as im needed i suppose</s>  why</s> must you go back</s> nonot exactly</s> not exactly</s>  what are you driving at</s> why theres nothing to be found out by telegraphing</s>  some one must goup to the place where the accident happened</s>  she sees that and shewants to go</s>  she cant realize at all what it

lounge in expression of her resolution on thispoint</s>  she must send somebodysome of their men</s>  she mustnt go</s>  itstoo hideous</s> no said matt thoughtfully</s>  i shall go</s> you</s> why not</s>  i can be at the place by four or five in the morning and ican ascertain all the facts and be able to relieve this terriblesuspense for her</s> for both of them suggested louise</s>  it must be quite as bad for thatpoor sick old maid</s> why of course said matt and he felt so much ashamed of having lefther out of the account that he added i dare say its even worse forher</s>  shes seen enough of life to realize it more</s> sue was his favorite though louise returned</s>  of course you must gomatt</s>  you couldnt do less</s>  its magnificent of you</s>  have you toldher yet that you would go</s> not yet</s>  i thought i would talk it over with you first</s> oh i approve of it</s>  its the only thing to do</s>  and i had better stayhere till you come backwhy no im not sure</s>  he came a little nearer and dropped his voice</s> youd better know the whole trouble louise</s>  theres great trouble forthem whether hes dead or alive</s>  theres something wrong in his accountswith the company and if he was on that train he was running away tocanada to escape arrest</s> he could see that only partial intelligence of the case reached her</s> then if hes killed it will all be hushed up</s>  i see</s>  it makes you hopehes killed</s> matt gave a despairing groan</s>  if hes killed it makes it just so muchthe worse</s>  the defalcation has to come out any way</s> when must it come out</s> a good many people know of it and such things are hard to keep</s>  it maycome outsome rumor of itin the morning papers</s>  the question iswhether you want to stay till they know it here whether it would bewise or useful</s> certainly not</s>  i should want to kill anybody that was by when such athing as that came out and i should despise sue northwick if she let meget away alive</s>  i must go at once</s> she slid herself from the lounge and ran to the glass where she put upa coil of hair in the knot it had escaped from</s> i had my doubts matt said about letting you come here withouttelling you just what the matter was but mother thought you wouldinsist upon coming any way and that you would be embarrassed</s> oh that was quite right said louise</s>  the great thing now is toget away</s> i hope you wont let her suspectwell i think you can trust me for that matt said louise turninground upon him with a hairpin in her mouth long enough to give him assarcastic a glance as she could</s>  if her present selfpossession was awarrant of future performance matt thought he could trust her but hewas afraid louise had not taken in the whole enormity of the fact andhe was right in this</s>  as a crime she did not then or ever afterwardsfully imagine it</s>  it may be doubted whether she conceived of it as otherthan a great trouble and as something that ought always to be kept fromher friend</s> matt went down stairs and found sue northwick in the library</s> i feel perfectly sure she said that we shall hear of my father atspringfield</s>  one of the horses he got there has gone lame and it wouldbe quite like him to stop and look up another in the place of it on thesame farm</s> the logic of this theory did not strike matt but the girl held her headin such a strong way she drew her short breaths with such a smoothnessshe so visibly concealed her anxiety in the resolution to believeherself what she said that he could not refuse it the tribute of anapparent credence</s>  yes that certainly makes it seem probable</s> at any rate she said if i hear nothing from him there or we get nonews from wellwater i shall go there at once</s>  ive made up my mind tothat</s> i shouldnt wish you to go alone sue adeline quavered</s>  her eyes werered and her lips swollen as if she had been crying and now the tearscame with her words</s>  you could never get there alone in the world</s> dont you remember it took us all day to get to wellwater the last timewe went to quebec</s> sue gave her sister a severe look as if to quell her open fears atleast and matt asked aimlessly is it on the way to quebec</s> sue picked up the railroad guide from the desk where she had left it</s> yes it is and it isnt</s>  she opened the book and showed him the mapof the road</s>  the train divides at wellwater and part goes to montrealand part to quebec</s>  there are all sorts of stops and starts on thequebec branch so that you dont arrive till next morning but you getto montreal in five or six hours</s>  but the whole thing seems perfectlyfrantic</s>  i dont see why we pay the slightest attention to it</s>  ofcourse papa has stayed over in springfield for something only hesusually so careful about telegraphing us if he changes his plansshe faltered and let the book drop</s>  matt picked it up for her andbegan to look at the timetable at first to hide the pain he felt atthe selfdiscouragement in which she ended and then to see if he mightnot somehow be useful to her</s>  i see that a train from boston meets thespringfield train at wellwater</s> does there</s>  she bent to look over the book with him and he felt theungovernable thrill at being near the beauty of a womans face which aman never knows whether to be ashamed of or glad of but which he cannothelp feeling</s>  then perhaps i had better go by way of boston</s>  what timedoes it start</s>  oh i see</s>  seven thirty</s>  i could get that trainif idont hear from him at springfield</s>  but i know i shall hear</s> a stir of drapery made them aware of louise at the library door</s>  suzettewent toward her are you going</s>  she asked without apparently sharingthe surprise matt felt at seeing his sister with her hat and gloves onand her jacket over her arm</s> yes im going sue</s>  i just ran up to see youi had to do thatbut weboth know im of no use here and so we wont make any pretences</s> louise spoke very steadily almost coldly her brother did not quiteknow what to make of her she was pale and she looked down while shespoke</s>  but when she finished buttoning the glove she was engaged withshe went up and put both her hands in suzettes</s>  i dont need to tellyou that im going just to get myself out of your way</s>  it isnt a timefor ornamental friendshipping and youve got all the good you couldout of seeing me and knowing that im anxious with you</s>  thats aboutall there is of it and i guess wed better not spin it out</s>  butremember sue whenever you need me when you really want me you cansend for me and if i dont come again till you do youll know that imsimply waiting</s>  will you remember thatwhatever happens</s> matt gave a long tacit sigh of relief</s> yes i will louise said suzette</s>  they kissed each other as if informal ratification of their compact which meant so much more to one ofthem than it could to the other</s> come matt</s>  said louise</s> she added hastily to prevent insistence against her plan that theywould have time to walk to the station and she wished to walk</s>  thenmatt said i will see you aboard the train and then ill come back andwait till you hear from springfield miss suzette</s> that is a good idea said louise</s> but adeline urged tremulously shant you be afraid to go to bostonalone</s>  itll be dark by the time you get there</s> the journey cant be very dangerous said louise and when i arrivei shall put myself in charge of a faithful boston hackman and tell himim very valuable and am to be taken the best of care of</s>  then i shallbe set down at our door in perfect safety</s> they all had the relief of a little laugh even adeline joinedreluctantly in it</s> when they were once free of the house matt said i wonder whether shewill remember after the worst comes what you said and whether shewill trust you enough to turn to us</s> i dont know</s>  probably she will be too proud at first</s>  but i shallcome whether she asks me or not</s>  if they had relations or connectionsas everybody else has it would be different</s>  but as it isyes of course said matt</s> i wish i could realize that sue is fond of him as we are of papa</s>  buti cant</s>  he always made me feel creepy didnt he you</s> he was a secret person</s>  but as far as i had anything to do with him atthe mills when i was there i found him square enough</s>  he was a countryperson</s> i suppose sues pride is countrified said louise</s> matt went on his secrecy may have been only a sort of shyness heavenknows i dont want to judge him</s>  i suppose that that slow deliberationof his was an effort to maintain himself with dignity</s>  of course we seehim now in the light of his rascality poor man and most of his traitsseem ugly</s> they had a little time after they reached the station and they walkedup and down the platform talking and matt explained how his fathermight be glad to have him go to wellwater and settle the questionwhether northwick was in the accident or not</s>  it would be a great relieffor him to know</s>  he tried to make out that he was going from a dividedmotive</s> oh you neednt be at the trouble to say all that to me matt saidlouise</s>  i dont blame you for wanting to go even out of kindness</s> no i suppose theres no guilt attaching to a thing of that kind mattanswered</s> there were a good many loungers about the station young men and girlsreleased from the shops for the day in such towns they find the stationan agreeable resort and enjoy a neverfailing excitement in the comingand going of the trains</s>  they watched the hilarys as they walked withenvy of that something distinguished which both of them had</s>  they wereboth tall and handsomely made and they had the ease before theirfellowbeings which perhaps comes as much from the lifelong habit ofgood clothes as from anything else</s>  matt had a conscience againstwhatever would separate him from his kind but he could not helpcarrying himself like a swell for all that and louise did not try tohelp it for her part</s>  she was an avowed worldling and in this qualityshe now wore a drab cloth costume bordered with black fur down thefront of the jacket and around it at the hips the skirt which fellplain to her feet had a border of fur there and it swirled and swayedwith her long dashing stride in a way that filled all those poor girlswho saw it with despair</s>  it seemed to interest almost as painfully ayoung man with a thin delicate face whom she noticed looking at hershe took him at first for one of those educated or halfeducatedoperatives who are complicating the labor problem more and more</s>  he wasno better dressed than others in the crowd and there was no reason whyhe should not be a hatshop or a shoeshop hand and yet at a secondglance she decided that he was not</s>  he stood staring at her with astudious frown and with the faint suggestion of a sneer on hiscleanshaven fine lips but she knew that he was admiring her howeverhe might be hating her and she spoke to matt about him as they turnedfrom him in their walk and promised to point him out</s>  but when they cameup again to where he had been standing he was gone</s>  the train came inand louise got aboard and matt made his way into the station and wentto ask the operator in the telegraph office if she had got anything formiss northwick</s> she said something just come</s>  i was waiting for the hack to send itup</s> oh i will take it if you please</s>  i am going back to mr</s>  northwickssaid matt</s> all right</s> matt took the dispatch and hurried out to find some means of gettingquickly to miss northwick with it</s>  there was no conveyance about thestation and he started up the street at a gait which was little shortof a run and which exposed him to the ridicule of such small boys asobserved his haste in their intervals of punging</s>  one who dropped fromthe runner of a sleigh which came up behind him jeered him for theawkwardness with which he floundered out of its way in the deep snow ofthe roadside</s>  the sleigh was abruptly halted and sue northwick calledfrom it mr</s>  hilary</s>  i couldnt wait at home and ive just been at thedepot by the lower road</s>  you have a dispatch</s> yes i have a telegram</s> oh give it to me</s> he withheld it a moment</s>  i dont know what it is miss northwick</s>  butif isnt what you expected will you letwill you allow meas if she did not know what she was doing she caught the dispatch fromhis hand and tore

 but she turned over the hand on which he was keepinghis and clutched his hand hard the tears the first she had shed thatday gushed into her eyes</s>  she lifted the reins and drove away and hestood in the road gazing after her till her sleigh vanished over therise of ground to the southward</s> xiii</s> the pale light in which matt hilary watched the sleigh out of sightthickened into early winter dusk before his train came and he got off toboston</s>  in the meantime the electrics came out like sudden moons andshed a lunar ray over the region round about the station where a youngman who was in the habit of describing himself in print as one of theboston events young men found his way into an eatinghouse not farfrom the track</s>  it had a simple domestic effect inside and the youngman gave a sigh of comfort in the pleasant warmth and light</s>  there was awoman there who had a very conversable air a sort of eventualsociability as the young man realized when she looked up from twitchingthe white clean cloths perfectly straight on the little tables set inrows on either side of the room</s> she finally reached the table where the young man had taken a chair forhis

said that ifyou were an old man and you married a young woman he guessed that waswhat you had got to expect</s>  this gave him occasion to enlarge upon thehappiness to be found only in the married

harden my cheek for that interview</s>  yourdiffidence is infectious maxwell</s> xiv</s> pinney was really somewhat dashed by maxwells attitude both because itappealed to the more delicate and generous self which he was obliged topocket so often in the course of business and because it made himsuspect that maxwell had already interviewed northwicks family</s>  theywould be forewarned in that case and would of course refuse to seehim</s>  but he felt that as a spaceman with the privilege of filling allthe space he chose with this defalcation his duty to his familyrequired him to use every means for making copy</s> he encouraged himself by thinking of his wife and what she was probablydoing at that moment in their flat in boston and he was feeling fairlywell when he asked for miss

couldnt get anything by telegraph</s>  that is the reason he went</s> it seemed to pinney that she wished to tell him who went but she didnot tell him and after waiting for a moment in vain he rose

them to pinney</s>  wont you carry these toyour wife</s>  she said</s>  this was not only a recognition of pinneys worthin being so fond of his wife but a vague attempt at propitiation</s>  shethought it might somehow soften the heart of the interviewer in him andkeep him from putting anything in the paper about her</s>  she was afraid toask him not to do so</s> oh thank you said pinney</s>  i didnt mean toits very kind ofyoui assure you</s>  he felt very queer to be remanded to the purelyhuman basis in relation to these people and he made haste to get awayfrom that interview</s>  he had nothing to blame himself for and yet he nowsuddenly somehow felt to blame</s>  in the light of the defaulters homelife northwick appeared his victim</s>  pinney was not going to punish himhe was merely going to publish him but all the same for that momentit seemed to him that he was northwicks persecutor and was hunting himdown running him to earth</s>  he wished that poor old girl had not givenhim those flowers he did not feel that he could take them to his wifeon the way back to the station he stepped aside from the road anddropped them into the deep snow</s> his wife met him at the

her first place as operator in the new hotel and he brought ina despatch for her to send to boston just as she was going to shut upthe office for the night and go in to see the dancing in the maindiningroom and perhaps be asked to dance herself by some of theclerks</s> at the sound of a pencil tapping on the ledge of the little window inthe castiron filagree wall of her den she turned

being good</s>  this tendency only grew upon them with thegreater intimacy of marriage</s>  the chief reason for thinking that theywere good was that they loved each other so much she knew that he wasgood because he loved her and he believed that he must have a greatdeal of good in him if such a girl loved him so much</s>  they thought it avirtue to exist solely for one another as they did their mutualdevotion seemed to them a form of unselfishness</s>  they felt it a greatmerit to be frugal and industrious that they might prosper theyprospered solely to their own advantage but the advantage of persons sodeserving through their frugality and industry seemed a kind ofaltruism it kept them in constant good humor with themselves andcontent with each other</s>  they had risked a

louise</s> oh no papa</s>  only think them</s> xvii</s> hilary had to yield to the pressure on him and send detectives to lookinto the question of northwicks fate at the scene of the accident</s>  itwas a formal violation of his promise to northwick that he should havethree days unmolested but perhaps the circumstances would havejustified hilary to any business man and it could really matter nothingto the defaulter dead or alive</s>  in either case he was out of harms way</s> matt all the same felt the ghastliness of being there on the sameerrand with these agents of his father and reaching the same facts withthem</s>  at moments it seemed to him as if he were tacitly working inagreement with them for the same purpose as well as to the same endbut he would not let this illusion fasten upon him and he kept faithwith suzette in the last degree</s>  he left nothing undone which she couldhave asked if he had done he invented some quite useless things to doand did them to give his conscience no cause against him afterwards</s> the fire had left nothing but a few charred fragments of the wreck</s> there had been no means of stopping it and it had almost completelyswept away the cars in which it had broken out</s>  certain of the cars tothe windward were not burnt these lay capsized beside the track bentand twisted and burst athwart fantastically like the pictures ofderailed cars as matt had seen them in the illustrated papers thelocomotive pitched into a heavy drift was like some dead monster thathad struggled hard for its life</s>  where the fire had raged there was awide black patch in the whiteness glistening everywhere else there wereashes and writhen ironwork and bits of charred woodwork but nothingto tell who or how many had died there</s>  it was certain that the porterand the parlorcar conductor were among the lost and his list ofpassengers had perished with the conductor there was only left with theoperator the original of that telegram asking to have a chair reservedin the pullman from wellwater and signed with northwicks name butthose different initials which had given rise to the report of hisdeath</s> this was the definite fact which matt could carry back with him tonorthwicks family and this they knew already</s>  it settled nothing itleft the question of his death just where it was before</s>  but mattstruggled with it as if it were some quite new thing and spent himselfin trying to determine how he should present it to them</s>  in his own mindhe had very great doubt whether northwick was in the accident andwhether that dispatch was not a trick a ruse to cover up the realcourse of his flight</s>  but then there was no sense in his trying to hidehis track for he must have known that as yet there was no pursuit</s>  ifthe telegram was a ruse it was a ruse to conceal the fact thatnorthwick was still in the country and had not gone to canada at all</s> but matt could not imagine any reason for such a ruse the motive mustbe one of those illogical impulses which sometimes govern criminals</s>  inany case matt could not impart his conjectures to the poor women whomust be awaiting his return with such cruel anxiety</s>  if the man werereally dead it would simplify the matter beyond the power of any otherfact matt perceived how it would mitigate the situation for his familyhe could understand how people should hold that suicide was the onlything left for a man in northwicks strait</s>  he blamed himself for cominga moment to that ground and owned the shame of his interested motivebut it was nevertheless a relief which he did not know how to refusewhen suzette northwick took what he had to tell as final proof that herfather was dead</s> she said that she had been talking it all over with her sister and theywere sure of it they were prepared for it they expected him to tellthem so</s> matt tried to have her realize that he had not told her so and heurged as far as he could the grounds for hoping that her father wasnot in the accident</s> she put them all aside</s>  the difference in the initials was really nodifference and besides and above all there was the fact that if herfather were anywhere alive he must have seen the report of his death bythis time and sent some word made some sign for their relief</s>  she wasdoubly sure of this because he was so anxiously thoughtful of them whenthey were separated</s>  he expected them to notify him of every slightchange in their plans when they were away and always telegraphed as tohis own</s>  the only mystery was his going to canada without letting themknow his plans before or afterwards</s>  it must have been upon some verysuddenly urgent business that took his mind off everything else</s> matt silently hung his head dreading lest she should ask him what hethought and wondering how he must answer if she did</s>  he perceived thathe had no choice but to lie if she asked him but when he volunteerednothing she did not ask him</s> it was the second morning after he had left her but he could see thatshe had lived long since their parting</s>  he thought that is the way shewill look as she grows old</s>  the delicate outline of her cheeks showed aslight straightening of its curve her lips were pinched the aquilinejut of her nose was sharpened</s>  there was no sign of tears in her eyesbut adeline wept and constantly dried her tears with her handkerchief</s> she accepted her affliction meekly as suzette accepted it proudly andshe seemed to leave all the conjectures and conclusions to her sister</s> suzette was in the exaltation which death first brings to the bereavedwhen people say that they do not realize it yet and that they will feelit later</s>  then they go about especially if they are women in a sort ofhysterical strength they speak calmly of what has happened they helpthose beyond the immediate circle of their loss to bear up against itthese look to see them break suddenly under the stress of theirbereavement and wonder at their impassioned fortitude</s> matt knew neither how to stay nor to get away it seemed intrusive tolinger and inhuman to go when he had told the little he had to tell</s> suzette had been so still so cold in receiving him that he wasastonished at her intensity when he rose to leave her at last</s> i shall never forget what you have done for us mr</s>  hilary</s>  never</s> dont belittle it or try to make it seem nothing</s>  it was everything</s>  iwonder you could do it</s> yes</s>  adeline put in as if they had been talking his kindness over aswell as their loss and were of one mind about it</s> oh indeed</s>  he began</s>  any one would have done itdont say so</s>  cried suzette</s>  you think that because you would havedone it for any one</s>  but you have done it for us and as long as ilive i shall remember that</s>  ohshe broke off and dropped her facewith a pathetic childlike helplessness on her lifted arm and now hewas less than ever able to leave her</s>  they all sat down again afterthey had risen to part matt felt the imperative necessity ofencouraging them of rescuing her from the conjecture which she hadaccepted as certainty</s>  he was one of those men in whom passion can beborn only of some form of unselfish kindness and who alone can makewomen happy</s>  if it was love that was now stirring so strangely at hisheart he did not know it was love he thought it was still the pitythat he had felt for the girls immense calamity</s>  he knew that fromevery phase of it he could not save her but he tried to save her fromthat which now confronted them and from which he saw her suffering</s>  hewent over all the facts again with the hapless creatures and reasonedfrom them the probability that their father was still alive</s>  it wasrespite from sorrow which misery must follow it was insane it wasfoolish it was even guilty but he could not help trying to win it forthem and when he left them at last they were bright with the hope hehad given them and which the event whether it was death or whether itwas disgrace must quench in a blacker despair</s>
the truth of this rushed upon him when he found himself staggering awayfrom the doomed house which cast its light gayly out upon the snow andfollowed him with a perverse sense of its warmth and luxury into thenight</s>  but a strange joy mixed with the trouble in his soul and for allthat sleepless night the conflict of these emotions seemed to toss himto and fro as if he were something alien and exterior to them</s>  northwickwas now dead and his death had averted the disgrace which overhung hisname now he was still alive and his escape from death had righted allthe wrong he had done</s>  then his escape had only deepened the shame hehad fled from his death had fixed a stain of a bloodguiltiness on hismisdeeds and was no caprice of fate but a judgment of the eternaljustice</s>  against this savage conclusion matt rebelled and made hisstand</s> xviii</s> for fortyeight hours longer the fact of the defalcation was kept backbut then in view of the legal action urged by those who did not acceptthe theory of northwicks death it had to come out and it broke allbounds in overwhelming floods of publicity</s> day after day the papers were full of the facts and it was weeks beforethe editorial homilies ceased</s>  from time to time fresh details andunexpected revelations wise guesses and shameless fakes renewed theinterest of the original fact</s>  there were days when there was nothingabout it in the papers and then days when it broke out in vividparagraphs and whole lurid columns again</s>  it was not that the fraud wassingular in its features these were common to most of the defalcationsgreat and small which were of daily fame in the newspapers</s>  but thedoubt as to the mans fate and the enduring mystery of his whereaboutsif he were still alive were qualities that gave peculiar poignancy tonorthwicks case</s>  its results in the failure of people not directlyinvolved were greater than could have been expected and the sum of hispeculations mounted under investigation</s>  it was all much worse than hadbeen imagined and in most of the editorial sermons upon it the moralgravity of the offence was measured by the amounts stolen and indirectlylost by it</s>  there was a great deal of mere astonishment as usual thatthe crime should have been that of a man whom no one would have dreamedof suspecting and there was some sufficiently ridiculous consternationat the presence of such moral decay in the very heart of the commerciallife of boston</s> in the events pinney made his report of the affair the work of artwhich he boasted should come from his hand</s>  it was really a spacemansmasterpiece and it appealed to every nerve in the readers body withits sensations repeated through many columns and continued from page topage with a recurrent efflorescence of scareheads and catchlines</s>  inthe ardor of production all scruples and reluctances became fused in adevotion to the interests of the events and its readers</s>  with everyhour the painful impressions of his interview with miss northwick grewfainter and the desire to use it stronger and he ended by sparing nocolor of it</s>  but he compromised with his sympathy for her by deepeningthe shadows in the behavior of the man who could bring all this sorrowupon those dearest to him</s>  he dwelt upon the unconsciousness of thefamily the ignorance of the whole household in which life ran smoothlyon while the head of both was a fugitive from justice if not thevictim of a swift retribution</s>  he worked in all the pathos which thefacts were capable of holding and at certain points he enlarged thecapacity of the facts</s>  he described with a good deal of graphic forcethe northwick interior</s>  under his touch the hall expanded the staircasewidened and curved the carpets thickened the servants multiplied thelibrary into which the events representative was politely usheredwas furnished with all the appliances of a cultured taste</s>  the worksof the standard authors in costly bindings graced its shelvesmagnificent paintings and groups of statuary adorned its walls andalcoves</s>  the dress of the lady who courteously received the eventsreporter was suitably enriched her years were discounted and herbeauty approached to the patrician cast</s>  there was nothing mean aboutpinney and while he was at it he lavished a manorial grandeur upon thenorthwick place outside as well as inside</s>  he imparted a romanticconsequence to hatboro itself a thriving new england town proud ofits historic past and rejoicing in its modern prosperity with apopulation of some five or six thousand souls among whose working menand women modern ideas of the most advanced character had been realizedin the wellknown peck social union with its cooperative kitchen andits clientle of intelligent members and patrons</s> people of all occupations became leading residents in virtue of takingpinney into their confidence and a prominent proletarian achieved thedistinction of a catchline by freely imparting the impressions of j</s>  m</s> northwicks character among the workingclasses</s>  the consensus ofpublic feeling in portraying which pinney did not fail to exploit theproprietary word he had seized formed the subject of some dramaticparagraphs and the whole formed a rich and fit setting for the mainfacts of northwicks undoubted fraud and flight and for the conjectureswhich pinney indulged in concerning his fate</s> pinneys masterpiece was in fine such as he could write only at thatmoment of his evolution as a man and such as the events could publishonly at that period of its development as a newspaper</s>  the report wasflashy and vulgar and unscrupulous but it was not brutal except byaccident and not unkind except through the necessities of the case</s>  butit was helplessly and thoroughly personal and it was no morephilosophized than a monkish chronicle of the middle ages</s> the abstract addressed a different class of readers and aimed at adifferent effect in its treatment of public affairs</s>  we look uponnewspapers as having a sort of composite temperament formed from thetemperaments of all the different men employed on them but as a matterof fact they each express the disposition and reflect the temperamentof one controlling spirit which all the other dispositions andtemperaments yield to</s>  this is so much the case that it is hard toefface the influence of a strong mind from the journal it has shapedeven when it is no longer actively present in it</s>  a good many yearsbefore the time of the northwick defalcation the events had been inthe management of a journalist once wellknown in boston a certainbartley hubbard who had risen from the ranks of the reporters and whohad thoroughly reporterized it in the worst sense</s>  after he left it theowner tried several devices for elevating and reforming it but failedpartly because he was himself a man of no ideals but those of thecountingroom and largely because the paper could not recover from thestrong slant given it without selfdestruction</s>  so the eventscontinued what bartley hubbard had made it and what the readers he hadcalled about it liked it to be a journal without principles and withoutconvictions but with interests only a map of busy life indeed butglaringly colored with crude endeavors at picturesqueness and with nomore truth to life than those railroad maps where the important centresconverge upon the broad black level of the line advertised and leaverival roads wriggling faintly about in uninhabited solitudes</s>  inhubbards time the abstract then the chronicleabstract was incharge of the editor who had been his first friend on the boston pressand whom he finally quarreled with on a point which this friendconsidered dishonorable to hubbard</s>  ricker had not since left the paperand though he was called a crank by some of the more progressive andreckless of the young men he clung to his ideal of a conscience injournalism he gave the abstract a fixed character and it could no morehave changed than the events without selfdestruction</s>  the men underhim were not so many as csars soldiers and

authorized to do the work</s> he got no word from the detective who had given him a hint of theaffair to go ahead the night after his return from hatboro as he hadexpected but he knew that the fact could not be kept back and heworked as hard at his report as pinney and pinneys wife had worked attheirs</s>  he waited till the next morning to begin however for he wastoo fagged after he came home

ricker</s>  the editor had not gone to dinner yet and he gavemaxwells work the critical censure of a hungry man</s>  it was in twoseparate parts one a careful and lucid statement of all the factswhich had come to maxwells knowledge in his quality of reporter setdown without sensation and in that selfrespectful decency of tonewhich the abstract affected the other an editorial comment upon thefacts</s>  ricker read the first through without saying anything when hesaw what the second was he pushed up his greenlined peak and saidhello young man</s>  who invited you to take the floor</s> nobody</s>  i found i couldnt embody my general knowledge of defalcationin the report without impertinence and as i had to get my wisdom off mymind somehow i put it in editorial shape</s>  i dont expect you to takeit</s>  perhaps i can sell it somewhere</s> ricker seemed to pay no attention to his explanation</s>  he went on readingthe manuscript and when he ended he took up the report again

said ricker</s>  of course you felt that the reportwas at least physically inadequate</s> i made as much as i honestly could of it</s>  i knew you didnt likepadding or faking and i dont myself</s> ricker was still holding the two manuscripts up before him</s>  he nowhanded them over his shoulder to maxwell where he stood beside him</s>  doyou think you could weld these two things together</s> i

was not difficult</s>  the material was really ofkindred character throughout</s>  he had merely to write a few prefatorysentences in the editorial attitude to his report and then append theeditorial

come with nerves steeled to bear the rejection of hisarticle entire but he was not prepared to suffer the erasure of all hispet phrases and favorite sentences sometimes running to entireparagraphs</s>

guaranty but the average morality of ourcommercial life</s>  how low this was might be inferred from the fact thatwhile such a defalcation as that of j</s>  m</s>  northwick created dismay inbusiness and social circles it could not fairly be said to createsurprise</s>  it was most unhappily a thing to be expected in proof ofwhich no stronger evidence need be alleged than that patent to theabstract

because he had been absent twentyfour hours without accountingfor his whereabouts</s> at this point maxwell wove in the material he had gathered on his visitto hatboro and without using names or persons contrived to give avivid impression of the situation and the local feeling</s>  he aimed at thehistorical attitude and with some imitation of tainos method andmanner he achieved it</s>  his whole account of the defalcation had acloseness of texture which involved every significant detail from thefirst chance suspicion of the defaulters honesty to the final opinionsand conjectures of his fate</s>  at the same time the right relation andproportion of the main facts were kept and the statement was throughoutso dignified and dispassionate that it had the grace of something remotein time

any one could</s>  at the same timeshe wished justice to be done though they should suffer and she cameto putney partly because she knew he had always disliked her fatherand she reasoned that such a

each step they took was at his suggestion</s>  they left thegreat house before the creditors were put in possession of the personalproperty and went to live in the porters lodge at the gate of

define hisdestination he could step off and get on where he pleased</s>  at first helet the conductor take up the mileage on his ticket as far as ponkwassetjunction but when he got there he kept on with the train northward inthe pretence that he was going on as far as willoughby junction to lookafter some business of his quarries</s>  he verified his pretence byspeaking of it to the conductor who knew him he was not a person totake conductors into his confidence but he felt obliged to account tothe man for his apparent change of mind</s>  he was at some trouble to makeit seem casual and insignificant and he wondered if the conductor meantto insinuate anything by saying in return that it was a pretty brisk dayto be knocking round much in a stone quarry</s>  northwick smiled in sayingit was rather he watched the conductor to see if he should betrayany particular interest in the matter when he left him</s>  but theconductor went on punching the passengers tickets and seemed to forgetnorthwick as soon as he left him</s>  at the next station northwickfollowed him out on the platform to find if he sent any telegram off</s> when he had once given way to this anxiety which he knew to beperfectly stupid and futile he had to yield to it at every station</s>  hetook his bag with him each time he left the car and he meant not to goback if he saw the conductor telegraphing</s>  it was intensely cold and inspite of the fierce heat of the stove at the end of the car the frostgathered thickly on the windows</s>  the train creaked when it stopped andstarted as if it were crunching along on a bed of dry snow the noisesof the wheels seemed at times to lose their rhythmical cadence and thennorthwick held his breath for fear one of them might be broken</s>  he had adread

it</s>  northwick felt a thrill of gratifiedcunning in realizing how mistaken the conductor was but he was willingthe fellow should think he was carrying up money to pay off his quarryhands</s> he was impatient to reach the junction where this conductor would leavethe train and it would continue northward in the charge of another manhe seldom went beyond willoughby on that road and the new conductorwould hardly know him</s>  he meant to go on to blackbrook junction andtake the new england central there for montreal but he saw theconductor go to the telegraph office at willoughby

stopped for dinner he was aware that noone knew him and he ate hungrily he felt strengthened and encouragedand he began to react against the terror that had possessed him</s>  heperceived that it was senseless and ridiculous that the conductor couldnot possibly have been telegraphing about him from willoughby and therewas as yet no suspicion abroad concerning him he might go freelyanywhere by any

five hours when itwould take him twelve hours to get to quebec it was certainly his dutyto go to montreal</s>  first of all he must put himself out of danger ofevery kind</s>  he must not even fatigue

operation of his mind</s>  it didnot seem to be working normally he could govern it but it was likesomething trying to get away from him like a headstrong restive horse</s> the notion suggested the colt that had fallen lame he wondered ifelbridge would look carefully after it and then he thought of all theother horses</s>  a torment of heartbreaking homesickness seized him hislove for his place

betrayednothing it looked as it always did like the face of a kindlyrespectable man a financially reliable face the face of a leadingcitizen</s>  he gathered courage and strength from it to put away theremorse that was devouring him</s>  if that was the way he looked that wasthe way he must be and he could only be leaving those so dear to himfor some good purpose</s>  he recalled that his purpose was to clear thename they bore from the cloud that must fall upon it to rehabilitatehimself to secure his creditors from final loss</s>  this was a goodpurpose the best purpose that a man in his place

it for an instant it was his only refuge</s>  then a new anguish seizedhim a doubt that swiftly became certainty and he knew that he hadsigned that dispatch northwick and not warwick he saw just how hissignature looked on the yellow manilla paper of the telegraph blank</s>  nowhe saw what a fool he had been to think of sending any dispatch</s>  hecursed himself under his breath and in the same breath he humbly prayedto god for some way of escape</s>  his terror made it certain to him that hewould be arrested as soon as he reached wellwater</s>  that would be thenext stop the conductor told him when he halted him with the questionon his way through the cars</s>  the conductor said they were behind timeand northwick knew by the frantic pull of the train that they wererunning to make up the loss</s>  it would simply be death to jump from thecar and he must not die he must run the risk</s>  in his prayer hebargained with god that if he would let him escape he would give everythought

heresolved to hide himself as soon as he reached wellwater it would bedark and he hoped that by this understanding with providence he couldelude the officer in getting out of the car</s>  but if there

wantedto laugh in thinking how he had baffled fate</s>  now if any inquiry weremade for him it would be at the montreal train before it started or atthe next station which was still within the american border on thatline</s>  but on the train for quebec which would reach stanstead in halfan hour he would be safe from conjecture even thanks to that dispatchasking for a chair on the montreal

him</s>  if he did not choose to keep straight on toquebec he could stop at lenoxville or sherbrooke and take up hisjourney again the next day</s>  at stanstead he ceased altogether to dealwith the past in his thoughts</s>  he was now safe from it beyond anypossible peradventure and he began to plan for the future</s>  he hadprepared himself for the allnight ride if he should decide to take itwith a cup of strong coffee at wellwater and he was alert in everyfaculty</s>  his mind worked nimbly and docilely now with none of thatperversity which had troubled him during the day with the fear

of the work before himand he saw how essential it was that he should make no false step butshould act at every moment with the sense that he was merely the agentof others in the effort to retrieve his losses</s> ii</s> at stanstead a party of three gentlemen came into the car and theirtalk presently found its way through northwicks revery at first as aninterruption an annoyance and afterwards as a matter of intensifyingpersonal interest to him</s>  they were in very good spirits and they madethemselves at home in the car there were only a few other passengers</s> they were going to montreal as he easily gathered and some friendswere to join them at the next junction and go on with them</s>  they talkedfreely of an enterprise which they wished to promote in montreal andthey were very confident of it if they could get the capital</s>  one ofthem said it was a thing that would have been done long ago if theyankees had been in it</s>  well we may strike a rich defaulter inmontreal another said and they all laughed</s>  their laughter shockednorthwick it seemed immoral he remembered that though he might seem adefaulter he was a man with a sacred trust and a high purpose</s>  but helistened eagerly if their enterprise were one that approved itself tohis judgment the chance of their discussing it before him might be aleading of providence which he would be culpable to refuse</s>  providencehad answered his prayer in permitting him to pass the american frontiersafely and northwick must not be derelict in fulfilling his part of theagreement</s>  the canadians

was perhaps too cynical for a partner of providence butwhich was natural in a man of his experience</s>  he knew something aboutprocesses to utilize the tailings of gold mines which would nototherwise pay for working he had paid enough for his knowledge so muchthat if he still had the purchasemoney he need not be going into exilenow and beginning life under a false name in a strange land</s> by and

now all roared together again and at sherbrooke they changed cars</s> northwick had to change too but he did not try to get into the same carwith them</s>  he wanted to think to elaborate in his own

stared athim</s>  he thought of elbridges baby that he had seen die</s>  it seemed agesago</s>  he offered the child a shilling it shyly turned its face into itsmothers dress</s>  the driver said e don know what money is yet butthe mother seemed to know she showed her teeth and took it for thechild</s>  northwick sat a moment thinking what a strange thing it was notto know what money was it had never occurred to him before he askedhimself a queer question what was money</s>  the idea of it seemed to go topieces as a printed word does when you look steadily at it and to haveno meaning</s>  it affected him as droll fantastic like a piece ofchildish makebelieve when the woman took some more money from him forhis meals and lodging</s>  but that was the way the world was worked</s>  youcould get anything done for money it was the question of demand andsupply nothing more</s>  he tried to think where money came in when he wentout to see elbridges sick boy when elbridge left the dead child todrive him to the station</s>  it was something else that came in there butthat thing and money were the same after all he had proved his lovefor his children by making money for them if he had not loved them somuch he would not have tried to get so much money and he would not havebeen where he was</s> his mind fought away from his control as the sledge slipped along overthe frozen river again</s>  it was very cold but the full sun on his headafflicted him like heat</s>  it was the blaze of light that beat up from thesnow too</s>  his head felt imponderable and yet he could not hold it up</s> it was always sinking forward and he woke from naps without being surethat he had been asleep</s> he intended to push through that day to chicoutimi but his start was solate that it seemed to him as if they would never get to haha bay</s>  whenthey arrived late in the afternoon all sense of progress thither fadedaway it was as if the starting and stopping were one or contained inthe same impulse</s>  it might be so if he kept on eleven miles further tochicoutimi but he would not be able to feel it so at the beginning thewish could involve its accomplishment only at the end</s>  he said tohimself that this was unreasonable it was a poor rule that would notwork both ways</s> this ran through his mind in the presence of the old man who bustled outof the door of the cabin where his carriole had stopped</s>  it was largerthan most of the other cabins of the place which northwick rememberedcuriously well some with their logs bare and some sheathed inbirchbark</s>  he remembered this man too when his white moustache whichbranched into either ear was a glistening brown and the droop of hisleft eyelid was more like a voluntary wink</s>  but the gayety of his facewas the same and his welcome was so cordial that a fear of recognitionwent through northwick</s>  he knew the man for the talkative canadian whohad taken him and his wife a drive over the hills around the bay in themorning when their boat arrived and afterwards stopped with them atthis cabin and had them in to drink a glass of milk</s>  northwicks wifeliked the man and said she would like to live in such a house in such aplace and should not be afraid of the winter that he told her was soterrible</s>  it was almost as if her spirit were there but northwick saidto himself that he must not let the man know that he had ever seen himbefore</s>  the resolution cost him something for he felt so broken andweak that he would have liked to claim his kindness as an oldacquaintance</s>  he would have liked to ask if he still caught wild animalsfor showmen and how his trade prospered if he had always lived at hahabay since they met</s>  but he was the more decided to ignore their formermeeting because the man addressed him in english at once and apparentlyknew him for an american</s>  perhaps other defaulters had been therebefore perhaps the mines had brought americans there prospecting</s>

set the door open and bowed northwickin</s>  baptiste</s>  he called to the driver over his shoulder take youorse to the stable</s>  he added a long queue of unintelligible french tohis english and the driver responded hall right</s> i am the only person at haha bay who speaks english he said in thesame terms he had used twenty years before when he presented himself tonorthwick and his wife on their steamboat and asked them if they wouldlike to drive before breakfast</s>  but you must know me</s>  birdoiseau</s> you have been here before</s> no said northwick with one lie for all</s>  the man with his cheer andgayety was even terribly familiar and northwick could have believedthat the room and the furniture in it were absolutely unchanged</s>  therewas the little window that he knew opened on the poor vegetable gardenwith its spindling corn and its beans for soup and coffee</s>  there wasthe chair his wife had sat in to look out on the things but for thefrost on the pane he could doubtless see them growing now</s> he sank into the chair and said to himself that he should die thereand it would be as well it would be easy</s>  he felt very old and weakand he did not try to take off the wraps which he had worn in thesledge</s>  he wished that he might fall so into his grave and be done withit</s> v</s> bird walked up and down the room talking he seemed overjoyed with thechance and as if he could not forego it for a moment</s>  well sir iwish that i could say as much</s>  but i have been here forty years hoffand on</s>  i am born at quebecin his tremulous

hecho</s>  well idont hear much haha nowadays round this bay</s>  but it is pretty here inthe summer yes very pretty</s>  prettier than chicoutimi and more gold inthe ills</s> he let his bold gay eye rest confidently on northwick as if to say heknew what had brought him there and he might as well own the fact atonce and northwick tried to get his mind to grapple with his realmotive</s>  but his mind kept pulling away from him like that unruly horseand he could not manage it</s>  he knew in that self which seemed apartfrom his mind that it would be a very good thing to let the man supposehe was there to look into the question of the mines but there wassomething else that seemed to go with that intention something like awish to get away from the past so remotely and so completely that norumor of it should reach him till he was willing to let it to be absentfrom all who had known him so long that no one of them would know him ifhe saw him</s>  he was there not only to start a pulpmill but to grow abeard that should effectually disguise him</s>  he recalled how he hadlooked with that long beard in his dream he put his hand to his chinand felt the eight days stubble there and he wondered how much time itwould take to grow such a beard</s> bird went on talking</s>  i know that chicoutimi company</s>  i told markhamabout the gold when he was here for bear</s>  he is smart but he dont knowheverything</s>  you think he can make it pay with that invention</s>  i doubtme</s>  there is one place in those ills and bird came closer tonorthwick and dropped his voice where you dont ave to begin withthe tailings</s>  i know the place</s>  but whats the good</s>  all the same youwant capital</s> he went to the shelf in the wall above the stove and took a pipe whichhe filled with tobacco and then he drew some coals out on the stovehearth</s>  but before he dropped one of them on his pipe with his hornythumb and finger he asked politely you hobject to the smoking</s> northwick said he did not and bird said it is one of three things youcan do here in the winter smoke the pipe cut the wood court theladies</s>  northwick remembered his saying that before too and how ithad made his wife laugh</s>  i used to do all three</s>  now i smoke the pipe</s> well while you are young it is all right and it is fun in the woods</s> but i was always omesick for quebec more or less</s>  you know what it isto be omesick</s> the word pierced northwick through the vagary which clothed hisconsciousness like a sort of fog and made his heart bleed withselfpity</s> well i been omesick forty years and i dont know what for any more</s> i been back to quebec it is not the same</s>  you know ow they pull downthose city gate</s>  what they want to do that for</s>  the gate did not keepthe stranger hout it let them in</s>  and there were too many people dead</s> now i think i am omesick just to get away from here</s>  if i had somecapitalten fifteen thousand

time of a setting en as you americans say their time</s> bird smoked away for a little while in silence and then he seemedaware for the first time that northwick had not taken off his wrapsand he said hospitably i ope you will spend the night with me here</s> northwick said thank you i dont know</s>  is it far to chicoutimi</s>  heknew but he asked hoping the man would exaggerate the distance andthen he would not have to go</s> it is eleven mile but the road is bad</s>  drifted</s> i will wait till tomorrow said northwick and he began to unswatheand unbutton but so feebly that bird noticed</s> allow me</s>  he said putting down his pipe and coming to his aid</s>  hewas very gentle and lighthanded like a woman but northwick felt onetouch on the pouch of his belt and refused further help</s> he let his host carry his two bags into the next room for him the bagthat he had brought with the few things from home when he pretendedthat he was coming away for a day or two and the bag that he had got inquebec to hold the things he had to buy there</s>  when bird set them downbeside his bed he could not bear to see the bag from home and he pushedit under out of sight</s>  then he tumbled himself on the bed and pulledthe bearskin robe that he found on it up over him and fell into a thinsleep that was not so different from his dim waking that he was sure ithad been sleep when bird came back with a lamp</s> been aving a little nap</s>  he asked looking gayly down on northwicksbewildered face</s>  well that is all right</s>  we have supper now prettysoon</s>  you hungry</s>  well in a alfhour</s> he went out again and northwick after some efforts made out to rise</s> his skull felt sore and his arms as if they had been beaten with hardblows</s>  but after he had bathed his face and hands in the warm water birdhad brought with the lamp he found himself better though he was stillwrapped in that cloudy uncertainty of himself and of his sleeping orwaking</s>  he saw some pictures about on the coarse white walls the sevenstations of the cross in colored prints a lithograph of indiansburning a jesuit priest</s>  over the beds head hung a chromo of our ladywith seven swords piercing her heart beside the bed was a pariancrucifix with the figure of christ writhing on it</s> these things made northwick feel very far and strange</s>  his simple andunimaginative nature could in nowise relate itself to this alien faiththis alien language</s>  he heard soft voices of women in the next room thefirst that he had heard since he last heard his daughters</s>  a girlsvoice singing was severed by a door that closed and then opened to letit be heard a few notes more and again closed</s> but he found bird still alone in the next room when he returned to it</s> well now we go to supper as soon as father tienne comes</s>  he is ourcurateour ministerhere</s>  and he eats with me when he heat anywhere</s>  itell im e hought to have my

same</s> papers</s>  no</s>  said northwick with horror and suspicion</s>  what is in thepapers</s> that is what i like to find hout said bird spreading his hands witha shrug</s> the outer door opened and a young man in a priests long robe came in</s> bird introduced his guest and northwick shook hands with the priestwho had a smooth regular face with beautiful innocent eyes like agirls</s>  he might have been twentyeight or twentynine he had the sparefigure of a man under thirty who leads an active life his features wererefined by study and the thought of others</s>  when he smiled the innocenceof his face was more than girlish it was childlike</s>  points of lightdanced in his large soft dark eyes an effect of trusting alluringkindness came from his whole radiant visage</s> northwick felt its charm with a kind of fear</s>  he shrank away from thepriest and at the table he left the talk to him and his host</s>  theysupped in a room opening into a sort of wing beyond it was a smallkitchen from which an elderly woman brought the dishes and where thatgirl whom he heard singing kept trilling away as if she were excitedlike a canary by the sound of the frying meat</s> bird said by way of introduction that the woman was his niece but hedid not waste time on her</s>  he began to talk up his conjecture as tonorthwicks business with the priest as if it were an ascertained fact</s> northwick fancied his advantage in leaving him to it</s>  they discussed thequestion of gold in the hills which the young father treated as an oldstory of faded interest and bird entered into with the fervor of freshexcitement</s>  the priest spoke of the poor return from the mines atchaudire but bird claimed that it was different here</s>  northwick didnot say anything he listened and watched them as if they were a pairof confidencemen trying to work him</s>  the priest seemed to be anxious toget the question off the personal ground into the region of theabstract and northwick believed that this was part of his game a ruseto throw him from his guard and commit him to something</s>  he made up hismind to get away as early as he could in the morning he did not thinkit was a safe place</s> very well</s>  the priest cried at one point</s>  suppose you had thecapital you wish</s>  and suppose you had taken out all the gold you say isthere and you were rich</s>  what would you do</s> what i do</s>  bird struck the table with his fist</s>  leave haha baytomorrow morning</s> and where would you go</s> go</s>  to quebec to london to paris to rome to the devil</s>  keep going</s> the young father laughed a laugh as innocent as his looks and turnedwith a sudden appeal to northwick</s>  tell me a little about the rich menin your land of millionnaires</s>  how do they find their happiness</s>  inwhat</s>  what is the secret of joy that they have bought with their money</s> i dont know what you mean said northwick with a recoil deeper intohimself after the first flush of alarm at being addressed</s> where do they live</s> northwick hesitated and the priest laid his hand on birds shoulder asif to restrain a burst of information from him</s> i suppose most of them live in new york</s> all the time</s> no</s>  they generally have a house at the seaside at newport or barharbor for the summer and one at lenox or tuxedo for the fall andthey go to florida for the winter or nice</s>  then they have theiryachts</s> the land is not large enough for their restlessness they roam the sea</s> my son said the young priest to the old hunter you can have all theadvantage of riches at the expense of a gypsies van</s>  he laughed againin friendly delight at birds supposed discomfiture and touched himlightly delicately as before</s>  it is the same in europe i have seenit there too</s>  bird was going to speak but the priest stayed him amoment</s>  but how did your rich people get their millions</s>  not like thoserich people in europe by inheritance</s> very few said northwick sensible of a remnant of the pride he usedto feel in the fact hidden about somewhere in his consciousness</s>  theymade it</s> how</s>  excuse me</s> by manufacturing by speculating in railroad stocks by mining by therise in landvalues</s> what causes the land to rise in value</s> the demand for it</s>  the necessity</s> oh</s>  the need of others</s>  and when a man gains in stocks some other manloses</s>  no</s>  do the manufacturers pay the operatives all they earn</s>  arethe miners very well paid and comfortable</s>  i have read that they aremiserable</s>  is it so</s> northwick was aware that there were good and valid answers to all thesequestions which the priest seemed to be asking rather for the confusionof bird than as an expression of his own opinions but in his dazedintelligence he could not find the answers</s> bird roared out haw</s>  do not regard him</s>  he is a man of the otherworldan angela mere imbecileabout business</s>  the priest threwhimself back in his chair and laughed tolerantly showing his beautifulteeth</s>  all those rich men they give work to the poor</s>  if i had a fewthousand dollars to hopen up that place in the ill i would furnishwork to every man in haha bayto hundreds</s>  are the miners moremiserable than those habitans eh</s> the good god seems to think so returned the priest seriously</s>  atleast he has put the gold in the rocks so that you cannot get it out</s> what would you give the devil to help you</s>  he asked with a smile</s> when i want to make a bargain with the devil i dont come to you pretienne i go to a notary</s>  you ever hear sir said bird turning tonorthwick about that notary at montreali think i will go to bed said northwick abruptly</s>  i am not feelingvery welli am very tired that is</s>  he had suddenly lost account ofwhat and where he was</s>  it seemed to him that he was both there and athatboro that there were really two northwicks and that there was athird self somewhere in space conscious of them both</s> it was this third northwick whom bird and the priest would have helpedto bed if he had suffered them but who repulsed their offers</s>  he madeshift to undress himself while he heard them talking in french withlowered voices in the next room</s>  their debate seemed at an end</s>  after alittle while he heard the door shut as if the priest had gone away</s> afterwards he appeared to have come back</s> vi</s> the talk went on all night in northwicks head between those twofrenchmen who pretended to be of contrary opinions but were reallyleagued to get the better of him and lure him on to put his money intothat mine</s>  in the morning his fever was gone but he was weak and hecould not command his mind could not make it stay by him long enough todecide whether any harm would come from remaining over a day before hepushed on to chicoutimi</s>  he tried to put in order or sequence thereasons he had for coming so deep into the winter and the wildernessbut when he passed from one to the next the former escaped him</s> bird looked in with his blue woollen bonnet on his head and his pipe inhis mouth and he removed each to ask how northwick was and whether hewould like to have some breakfast perhaps he would like a cup of teaand some toast</s> northwick caught eagerly at the suggestion and in a few minutes the teawas brought him by a young girl whom bird called virginie he said shewas his grandniece and he hoped that her singing had not disturbed thegentleman she always sang one could hardly stop her but she meant noharm</s>  he stayed to serve northwick himself and northwick tried to putaway the suspicion birds kindness roused in him</s>  he was in such need ofkindness that he did not wish to suspect it</s>  nevertheless he watchedbird narrowly as he put the milk and sugar in his tea and he listenedwarily when he began to talk of the priest and to praise him</s>  it was apleasure bird said for one educated man to converse with another andfather tienne and he often maintained opposite sides of a questionmerely for the sake of the discussion it was like a game of cards wherethere were no stakes you exercised your mind</s> northwick understood this too little to believe it when he talked hetalked business even the jokes among the men he was used to meantbusiness</s> then you havent really found any gold in the hills</s>  he asked slyly</s> my faith yes</s>  said bird</s>  but he added sadly perhaps it would notpay to mine it</s>  i will show you when you get up</s>  better not go tochicoutimi today</s>  it is snowing</s> snowing</s>  northwick repeated</s>  then i cant go</s> stop in bed till dinner</s>  that is the best bird suggested</s>  try to getsome sleep</s>  sleep is youth</s>  when we wake we are old again but some ofthe youth stick to our fingers</s>  no</s>  he smiled gayly and went outclosing the door softly after him and northwick drowsed</s>  in a dreambird came back to him with some specimens from his gold mine</s>  northwickcould see that the yellow metal speckling the quartz was nothing butcopper pyrites but he thought it best to pretend that he believed itgold for bird while he stood over him with a lamp in one hand wasfeeling with the other for the buckle of northwicks belt as he sat upin bed</s>  he woke in fright and the fear did not afterwards leave him inthe fever which now began</s>  he had his lucid intervals when he was awarethat he was wisely treated and tenderly cared for and that his host andall his household were his devoted watchers and nurses when he knew thedoctor and the young priest in their visits</s>  but all this he perceivedcloudily and as with a thickness of some sort of stuff between him andthe fact while the illusion of his delirium always the same wasalways poignantly real</s>  then the morning came when he woke from it whenthe delirium was past and he knew what and where he was</s>  the truth didnot dawn gradually upon him but possessed him at once</s>  his first motionwas to feel for his belt and he found it gone</s>  he gave a deep groan</s> the blue woollen bonnet of the old hunter appeared through the opendoorway with the pipe under the branching gray moustache</s>  the eyes ofthe men met</s> well said bird you are in you senses at last</s>  northwick did notspeak but his look conveyed a question which the other could notmisinterpret</s>  he smiled</s>  you want you belt</s>  he disappeared and thenreappeared this time full length and brought the belt to northwick</s> you think you are among some yankee defalcator</s>  he asked for soleresentment of the suspicion which northwicks anguished look must haveimparted</s>  count it</s>  i think you find it hall right</s>  but as the sickman lay still and made no motion to take up the belt where it layacross his breast bird asked you want me to count it for you</s> northwick faintly nodded and bird stood over him and told thethousanddollar bills over one by one and then put them back in thepouch of the belt</s> now i think you are going to get well</s>  the doctor e say to let yousee you money the first thing</s>  shall i put it hon you</s> northwick looked at the belt it seemed to him that the bunch the billsmade would hurt him and he said weakly you keep it for me</s> hall right said bird and he took it away</s>  he went out with a proudair as if he felt honored by the trust northwick had explicitlyconfirmed and sat down in the next room so as to be within call</s> northwick made the slow recovery of an elderly man and by the time hecould go out of doors without fear of relapse there were signs in theair and in the earth of the spring which when it comes to that northernland possesses it like a passion</s>  the grass showed green on the low barehills as the snow uncovered them the leaves seemed to break like anillumination from the trees the south wind blew back the birds with itsfirst breath</s>  the jays screamed in the woods the canadian nightingalessang in the evening and the early morning when he woke and thought ofhis place at hatboro where the robins broods must be halfgrown bythat time</s>  it was then the time of the appleblossoms there with hishomesick inward vision he saw the billowed tops of his orchard allpinkwhite</s>  he thought how the apples smelt when they first began todrop in august on the clean straw that bedded the orchard aisles</s>  itseemed to him that if he could only be there again for a moment he wouldbe willing to spend the rest of his life in prison</s>  as it was he was inprison it did not matter how wide the bounds were that kept him fromhis home</s>  he hated the vastness of the half world where he could comeand go unmolested this bondage that masked itself as such amplefreedom</s>  to be shut out was the same as to be shut in</s> in the first days of his convalescence while he was yet too weak toleave his room he planned and executed many returns to his home</s>  hewent back by stealth and disguised by the beard which had grown in hissickness and tried to see what change had come upon it but he couldnever see it different from what it was that clear winter night when heescaped from it</s>  this baffled and distressed him and strengthened thelonging at the bottom of his heart actually to return</s>  he thought thatif he could once look on the misery he had brought upon his children hecould bear it better he complexly flattered himself that it would notbe so bad in reality as it was in fancy</s>  sometimes when this wishharassed him he said to himself to still it that as soon as the firstboat came up the river from quebec he would go down with it andarrange to surrender himself to the authorities and abandon thestruggle</s> but as he regained his health he began to feel that this was a rash andfoolish promise he thought he saw a better way out of his unhappiness</s> it appeared a misfortune once more and not so much a fault of his</s>  hewas restored to this feeling in part by the respect the distinctionwhich he enjoyed in the little village and which pleasantly recalledhis consequence among the millpeople at ponkwasset</s>  when he wasdeclared out of danger he began to receive visits of polite sympathyfrom the heads of families who smoked round him in the evening andpredicted a renewal of his youth by the fever he had come throughsafely</s>  their prophecies were interpreted by bird and pre tienne aswith one or other of these he went to repay their visits</s>  everywherethe inmates of the simple clean little houses had begun early tofurbish them up for the use of their summer boarders while they gotready the shanties behind them for their own occupancy but everywherenorthwick was received with that pathetic deference which the poorrender to those capable of bettering their condition</s>  the secret of thetreasure he had brought with him remained safe with the doctor and thepriest and with bird who had discovered it with them but bird was notthe man to conceal from his neighbors the fact that his guest was agreat american capitalist who had come to develop the mineralagricultural and manufacturing interests of haha bay on the americanscale and to enrich the whole region buying land of those who wishedto sell and employing all those who desired to work</s>  if he wasimpatient for the verification of these promises by northwick he wastoo polite to urge it and did nothing worse than brag to him as hebragged about him</s>  he probably had his own opinion of northwicksreasons for the silence he maintained concerning himself in allrespects he knew from the tag fastened to the bag northwick had boughtin quebec that his name was warwick and he knew from northwick himselfthat he was from chicago beyond this if he conjectured that he was thevictim of financial errors he smoothly kept his guesses to himself andwould not mar the chances of good that northwick might do with his moneyby hinting any question of its origin</s>  the american defaulter was a sortof hero in birds fancy he had heard much of that character he wouldhave experienced no shock at realizing him in northwick he would haveaccounted for northwick and excused him to himself if need be</s>  thedoctor observed a professional reticence his affair was withnorthwicks body which he had treated skilfully</s>  he left his soul topre tienne who may have had his diffidence his delicacy in dealingwith it as the soul of a protestant and a foreigner</s> vii</s> it took the young priest somewhat longer than it would have taken a manof northwicks own language and nation to perceive that his gentlemanlydecorum and grave repose of manner masked a complete ignorance of thethings that interest cultivated people and that he was merely andpurely a business man a figment of commercial civilization with onlythe crudest tastes and ambitions outside of the narrow circle ofmoneymaking</s>  he found that he had a pleasure in horses and cattle andfrom hints which northwick let fall regarding his life at home that hewas fond of having a farm and a conservatory with rare plants</s>  but theflowers were possessions not passions he did not speak of them as ifthey afforded him any artistic or scientific delight</s>  the young priestlearned that he had put a good deal of money in pictures but then thepictures seemed to have become investments and of the nature of stocksand bonds</s>  he found that this curious american did not care to read theenglish books which bird offered to lend him out of the little store ofgifts and accidents accumulated in the course of years from bountiful orforgetful tourists the books in french pre tienne proposed to himnorthwick said he did not know how to read</s>  he showed no liking formusic except a little for the singing of birds niece virginie butwhen the priest thought he might care to understand that she sang theballads which the first voyagers had brought from france into thewilderness or which had sprung out of the joy and sorrow of its hardlife he saw that the fact said nothing to northwick and that it ratherembarrassed him</s>  the american could not take part in any of thosediscussions of abstract questions which the priest and the old woodsmandelighted in and which they sometimes tried to make him share</s>  heapparently did not know what they meant</s>  it was only when pre tiennegave him up as the creature of a civilization too ugly and arid to beborne that he began to love him as a brother when he could makenothing of northwicks mind he conceived the hope of saving his soul</s> pre tienne felt sure that northwick had a soul and he had hismisgivings that it was a troubled one</s>  he too had heard of theamerican defaulter who has a celebrity of his own in canada penetratingto different men with different suggestion and touching here and therea pure and unworldly heart such as pre tienne bore in his breastwith commiseration</s>  the young priest did not conceive very clearly ofthe make and manner of the crime he suspected the elusive and mysteriousstranger of committing but he imagined that the great sum of money heknew him possessed of was spoil of some sort and he believed thatnorthwicks hesitation to employ it in any way was proof of an uneasyconscience in its possession</s>  why had he come to that lonely place inmidwinter with a treasure such as that and why did he keep the money byhim instead of putting it in a bank</s>  pre tienne talked thesequestions over with bird and the doctor and he could find only oneanswer to them</s>  he wondered if he ought not to speak to northwick anddelicately offer him the chance to unburden his mind to such a friend asonly a priest could be to such a sinner</s>  but he could not think of anyapproach sufficiently delicate</s>  northwick was not a catholic and thechurch had no hold upon him</s>  besides he had a certain plausibility andreserve of demeanor that forbade suspicion as well as the intimacynecessary to the good which pre tienne wished to do the lonely andsilent man</s>  northwick was in those days much occupied with a piece ofwriting which he always locked carefully into his bag when he left hisroom and which he copied in part or in whole again and again burningthe rejected drafts in the hearthfire that had now superseded thestove and stirring the carbonized paper into ashes so that no word wasleft distinguishable on it</s> one day there came up the river a bateau from tadoussac bringing thenews that the ice was all out of the st</s>  lawrence</s>  it will not be longtime now said bird before we begin to see you countrymen</s>  thesteamboats come to haha bay in the last of june</s> northwick responded to the words with no visible sensation</s>  hissphinxlike reticence vexed bird more and more and intolerably deepenedthe mystification of his failure to do any of the things with hiscapital which bird had promised himself and his fellowcitizens</s>  he nolonger talked of going to chicoutimi that was true and there was notthe danger of his putting his money into markhams enterprise there butneither did he show any interest or any curiosity concerning birdsdiscovery of the precious metal at haha bay</s>  bird had his delicacy aswell as pre tienne and he could not thrust himself upon his guesteven with the intention of making their joint fortune</s> a few days later there came to pre tienne a letter which when heread it superseded the interest in northwick which bird felt gnawinghim like a perpetual hunger</s>  it was from the cur at rimouski wherepre tiennes family lived and it brought word that his mother whohad been in failing health all winter could

sure hes still in canada and expectsto make terms for getting home again</s>  he must be horribly homesick</s>
yes</s>  sewell suggested</s> yes</s>
 not because hes a man of any delicacy of feeling or much realaffection for his family</s>  ive no doubt hes fond of them in a way buthes fonder of himself</s>  you can see all through his letter that hestrying to make interest for himself and that hes quite willing to usehis children if it will tell on the public sympathies</s>  he knows verywell that theyre provided for</s>  they own the place at hatboro hedeeded it to them long before his crookedness is known to have begunand his creditors couldnt touch it if they wished to</s>  if he had reallythat fatherly affection for them which he appeals to in others hewouldnt have left them in doubt whether he was alive or dead for fouror five months and then dragged them into an open letter askingforbearance in their name and promising for their sake to right thosehe had wronged</s>  the thing is thoroughly indecent</s> since the fact of northwicks survival had been established beyondquestion by the publication of his letter hilarys

had defrauded</s> ah</s>  i dont know about that said sewell</s> no</s>  why not</s> because it would be a kind of romantic deceit that hed better not keepup</s> he seems to have kept it up for the last four or five months saidhilary</s> thats no reason he should continue to keep it up sewell persisted</s> perhaps he never knew of the rumor of his death</s> ah that isnt imaginable</s>  there

from it as far as he could that would be natural but toleave his children to believe a rumor of his death in order to savetheir feelings would be against nature it would be purely histrionica motive from the theatre that is perfectly false</s> pretty hard on hilary who invented it bellingham suggested and theyall laughed</s> i dont know said hilary</s>  the man seems to be posing in other ways</s> you would think from his letter that he was a sort of martyr toprinciple and that hed been driven off to canada by the heartlesscreditors whom hes going to devote his life to saving from loss if hecant do it in a few months or years</s>  he may not be a conscious humbugbut hes certainly a humbug</s>  take that pretence of his that he wouldcome back and stand his trial if he believed it would not result ingreater harm than good by depriving him of all hope of restitution</s> why theres a sort of crazy morality in that said corey</s> perhaps said bellingham the solution of the whole matter is thatnorthwick is cracked</s> ive no doubt hes cracked to a certain extent said sewell as everywrongdoer is</s>  you know the swedenborgians believe that insanity is thelast state of the

his wife when he went home</s>  if that poor old girlfreely consented it must have been at the point of the hairpin</s>  ofcourse the young one is right to obey her conscience but as a case ofconscience what do you think of it ellen</s>  and do you think one oughtto make any one else obey ones conscience</s> thats a hard question ralph</s>  and im not sure that shes right</s>  whyshould she give up her property if it was hers so long ago before thefrauds began</s>  suppose he were not their father and the case stood justas it does</s> ah theres something very strange about the duty of blood</s> blood</s>  i think suzette northwicks case of conscience is a case ofpride said mrs</s>  putney</s>  i dont believe she cares anything about theright and wrong of it</s>  she just wishes to stand well before the world</s> she would do anything for that</s>  shes as hard</s> thats what the world will say ive no doubt putney admitted</s> x</s> the next morning adeline came early to her sisters bed and woke her</s> i havent slept all nighti dont see how you couldand i want youshouldnt let mr</s>  putney send that letter to mr</s>  hilary just yet</s>  iwant to think it over first</s> you want to break your promise</s>  asked suzette wide awake at the firstword</s> adeline began to cry</s>  i want to think</s>  it seems such a dreadful thingto sell the place</s>  and why need you hurry to send off a letter to mr</s> hilary about it</s>  wont it be time enough when mr</s>  putney has thewritings ready</s>  i think it will look very silly to send word beforehand</s> i could see that mr</s>  putney didnt think it was businesslike</s> you want to break your promise</s>  suzette repeated</s> no i dont want to break my promise</s>  but i do want to do whatsright and i want to do what i think is right</s>  im almost sick</s>  i wantelbridge should stop for the doctor on his way to mr</s>  putneys</s>  shebroke into a convulsive sobbing</s>  oh suzette</s>  do give me a littlemore time</s>  wont you</s>  and as soon as i can see it as you dothey heard the rattling of a key in the back door of the cottage andthey knew it was elbridge coming to make the fire in the kitchen stoveas he always did against the time his wife should come to get breakfast</s> suzette started up from her pillow and pulled adelines face down onher neck so as to smother the sound of her sobs</s>  hush</s>  dont let himhear</s>  and i wouldnt let any one know for the world that we didntagree</s>  you can think it over all day if you want and ill stop mr</s> putney from writing till you think as i do</s>  but be still now</s>
 i will adeline whispered back</s>  and i wont quarrel withyou sue</s>  i know we shall think alike in the end</s>  only dont hurry me</s> and let elbridge get the doctor to come</s>  im afraid im going to be downsick</s> she crept sighing back to bed and after a little while suzette camedressed to look after her</s>  i think im going to get a little sleepnow she said</s>  but dont forget to stop mr</s>  putney</s> suzette went out into the thin sweet summer morning air and walked upand down the avenue between the lodge and the empty mansion</s>  she had notslept either it was from her first drowse that adeline had wakenedher</s>  but she was young and the breath of the cool southwest wind was abath of rest to her fevered senses</s>  she felt herself grow stronger init and she tried to think what she ought to do</s>  if her purpose of theday before still seemed so wholly and perfectly just it seemed verydifficult and she began to ask herself whether she had a right tocompel adelines consent to it</s>  she felt the perplexities of the worldwhere good and evil are often so mixed that when the problem passes fromthoughts to deeds the judgment is darkened and the will palsied</s>  tillnow the wrong had always appeared absolutely apart from the right forthe first time she perceived that a great right might involve a lesserwrong and she was daunted</s>  but she meant to fight out her fight whollywithin herself before she spoke with adeline again</s> that day matt hilary came over from his farm to see wade whom he foundas before in his study at the church and disposed to talk overnorthwicks letter</s>  its a miserable affair humiliatingheartsickening</s>  that poor souls juggle with his conscience is a mostpathetic spectacle</s>  i cant bring myself to condemn him very fiercely</s> but while others may make allowance for him its ruinous for him toexcuse himself</s>  thats truly perdition</s>  dont you feel that</s>  wadeasked</s> yes yes matt assented with a kind of absence</s>  but there issomething else i wanted to speak with you about and i suppose its thisletter thats made it seem rather urgent now</s>  you know when i asked youonce about jack wilmingtonwade shook his head</s>  there isnt the least hope in that direction</s>  imsure there isnt</s>  if he had cared anything for the girl he would haveshown it long ago</s> i quite agree with you said matt and that isnt what i mean</s>  but ifit would have been right and well for him to come forward at such atime why shouldnt some other man who does love her</s>  he hurriedtremulously on wade let me ask you one thing more</s>  you have seen herso much more than i and i didnt knowis it possibleperhaps i oughtto ask if you are at allif you care for her</s> for miss northwick</s>  what an idea</s>  not the least in the world</s>  why doyou ask</s> because i do</s>  said matt</s>  i care everything for her</s>  so much thatwhen i thought of my love for her i could not bear that it should be awrong to any living soul or that it should be a shadows strengthbetween her and any possible preference</s>  and i came here with my mindmade up that if you thought jack wilmington had still some right to ahearing from her i would stand back</s>  if there were any hopes for himfrom himself or from her i should be a fool not to stand back</s>  and ithoughti thought that if you old fellowbut now its all rightallrightmatt wrung the hand which wade yielded him with a dazed air at first</s>  agreat many things went through wades mind which he silenced on theirway to his lips</s>  it would not do to impart to matt the impressions of acold and arrogant nature which the girl had sometimes given him andwhich matt could not have received in the times of trouble and sorrowwhen he had chiefly seen her</s>  matts confession was a shock wade wasscarcely less dismayed by the complications which it suggested but hecould no more impart his misgivings than his impressions he could nomore tell matt that his father would be embarrassed and compromised byhis passion than he could tell him that he did not think sue northwickwas worthy of it</s>  he was in the helpless predicament that confidantsoften find themselves in but his final perception of hisimpossibilities enabled him to return the fervid pressure of mattshand and even to utter some of those incoherencies which serve thepurpose when another wishes to do the talking</s> of course said matt im ridiculous i know that</s>  i havent gotanything to found my hopes on but the fact that theres nothing in myway to the one insuperable obstacle to the fact that she doesnt andcant really care a straw for me</s>  but just now that seems a merebagatelle</s>  he laughed with a nervous joy and he kept talking as hewalked up and down wades study</s>  i dont know that i have the hope ofanything and i dont see how im to find out whether i have or not forthe present</s>  you know wade he went on with a simpleheartedsweetness which wade found touching im twentyeight years old and idont believe ive ever been in love before</s>  little fancies of coursesummer flirtations every one has them but never anything seriousanything like this</s>  and i could see at home that they would be gladto have had me married</s>  i rather think my father believes that a goodsensible wife would bring me back to faith in commercial civilization</s> he laughed out his relish of the notion but went on gravely poorfather</s>  this whole business has been a terrible trial to him</s> wade wondered at his ability to separate the thought of suzette from thethought of her father he inferred from his ability to do so that hemust have been thinking of her a great deal but he asked isnt it allrather sudden matt</s>  wade put on a sympathetic yet diplomatic smilefor the purpose of this question</s> not for me</s>  said matt</s>  he added not very consequently i suppose itmust have happened to me the first moment i saw her here that day louiseand i came up about the accident</s>  i couldnt truly say that she had everbeen out of my mind a moment since</s>  no theres nothing sudden about itthough i dont suppose these things usually take a great deal of timematt ended philosophically</s> wade left the dangerous ground he found himself on</s>  he asked and yourfamily do they know of yourfeeling</s> not in the least</s>  matt answered radiantly</s>  it will come on them likea thunderclap</s>  if it ever comes on them at all he addeddespondently</s> wade had his own belief that there was no cause for despondency in theaspect of the affair that matt was looking at</s>  but he could not offer toshare his security with matt who continued to look serious and saidpresently i suppose my father might think it complicated his relationto the northwicks trouble and i have thought that too</s>  it makes itvery difficult</s>  my father is to be considered</s>  you know wade i thinkthere are very few men like my father</s> there are none matt</s>  said wade</s> i dont mean hes perfect and i think his ideas are wrong most ofthem</s>  but his conduct is as right as the conduct of any quicktemperedman ever was in the world</s>  i know him and i dont believe a son everloved his father more and so i want to consider him all i can</s> ah i know that my dear fellow</s> but the question is how far can i consider him</s>  there are times saidmatt and he reddened and laughed consciously when it seems as if icouldnt consider him at all the times when i have some faint hope thatshe will listen to me or wont think me quite a brute to speak to herof such a thing at such a moment</s>  then there are other times when ithink he ought to be considered to the extreme of giving her upaltogether but those are the times when i know that i shall never haveher to give up</s>  then its an easy sacrifice</s> i understand said wade responding with a smile to mattsselfsatire</s> matt went on and as he talked he sometimes walked to wades window andlooked out sometimes he stopped and confronted him across his desk</s> its cowardly in a way not to speak at onceto leave her to sufferit out to the end alone but i think thats what i owe to my father</s>  noreal harm can come to her from waiting</s>  i risk the unfair chance i mightgain by speaking now when she sorely needs help but if ever she came tothink she had given herself through that needno it wouldnt do</s>  myfather can do more for her if he isnt hampered by my feeling andlouise can be her friendwhat do you think wade</s>  ive tried to puzzleit out and this is the conclusion ive come to</s>  is it rathercoldblooded</s>  i know it isnt at all like the lovemaking in the books</s>  isuppose i ought to go and fling myself at her feet in defiance of allthe decencies and amenities and obligations of life but somehow i cantbring myself to do it</s>  ive thought it all conscientiously over and ithink i ought to wait</s> i think so too matt</s>  i think your decision is a just mans and itsa true lovers too</s>  it does your heart as much honor as your head andwade gave him his hand now with no mental reservation</s> do you really think so caryl</s>  that makes me very happy</s>  i was afraidit might look calculating and selfinterestedyou selfinterested matt</s> oh i know</s>  but is it considering my duty too much my love too little</s> if i love her hasnt she the first claim upon me before father andmother brother and sister before all the world</s> if you are sure she loves you yes</s> matt laughed</s>  ah thats true i hadnt thought of that littlecondition</s>  perhaps it changes the whole situation</s>  well i must go now</s> ive just run over from the farm to see youi inferred that from your peasant garb said wade with a smile at therough farm suit matt had on his face refined it and made it look mildlyimprobable</s>  besides said wade as if the notion he recurred to wereimmediately relevant to matts dress unless you are perfectly sure ofyourself beyond any chance of change you owe it to her as well asyourself to take time before speaking</s> i am perfectly sure and i shall never change said matt with a shadeof displeasure at the suggestion</s>  if there were nothing but that ishould not take a moment of time</s>  he relented and smiled again inadding but i have decided now and i shall wait</s>  and im very muchobliged to you old fellow for talking the matter over with me andhelping me to see it in the right light</s> oh my dear matt</s>  said wade in deprecation</s> yes</s>  and oh by the way</s>  ive got hold of a young fellow that i thinkyou could do something for wade</s>  do you happen to remember the articleon the defalcation in the boston abstract</s> yes i do remember that</s>  didnt it treat the matter if i recall itvery humanelytoo humanely perhaps</s> perhaps from one point of view too humanely</s>  well its the writer ofthat articlea young fellow not twentyfive yet as completely at oddswith life as any one i ever saw</s>  he has a great deal of talent and nohealth or money so hes toiling feebly for a living on a dailynewspaper instead of making literature</s>  he was a reporter up to thetime he wrote that article but the managing editor is a man whorecognizes quality hes fond of maxwellthats the fellows nameandsince then hes given him a chance in the office at social topics</s>  buthe hasnt done very well the fact is the boys too literary and hesout of health and he needs rest and the comfort of appreciativefriendship</s>  i want you to meet him</s>  ive got him up at my place out ofthe east winds</s>  youll be interested in him as a typethe artistic typecynicised by the hard conditions of lifenewspaper conditions and theneconomic conditions</s> matt smiled with satisfaction in what he felt to be his very successfulformulation of maxwell</s> wade said he should be very glad to meet him and if he could be of anyuse to him he should be even more glad</s>  but his mind was still uponmatts love affair and as they wrung each others hands once more hesaid i think youve decided so wisely matt and justly andunselfishly</s> its involuntary unselfishness if its unselfishness at all saidmatt</s>  he did not go wade stood bareheaded with him at the outer door ofhis study</s>  after awhile he said with embarrassment wade</s>  do you thinkit would seem unfeelingor out of taste at allif i went to see herat such a time</s> why i cant imagine your doing anything out of taste matt</s> dont be so smooth caryl</s>  you know what i mean</s>  louise sent somemessages by me to her</s>  will you take them ori certainly see no reason why you shouldnt deliver miss hilarysmessages yourself</s> well i do said matt</s>  but you neednt be afraid</s> xi</s> matt took the lower road that wound away from wades church toward thenorthwick place but as he went he kept thinking that he must notreally try to see suzette</s>  it would be monstrous at such a time out ofall propriety of all decency it would be taking advantage of herhelplessness to intrude upon her the offer of help and of kindness whichevery instinct of her nature must revolt from</s>  there was only one thingthat could justify his coming and that was impossible</s>  unless he cameto tell her that he loved her and to ask her to let him take her burdenupon him to share her shame and her sorrow for his loves sake he hadno right to see her</s>  at moments it seemed as if that were right and hecould do it no matter how impossible and then he almost ran forwardbut only to check himself to stop short and doubt whether not to turnback altogether</s>  by such faltering progresses he found himself in thenorthwick avenue at last and keeping doggedly on from the mansionwhich the farm road had brought him to until he reached the cottage atthe avenue gate</s>  on the threshold drooped a figure that the sight of sethis heart beating with a stifling pulse in his throat and he flounderedon till he made out that this languid figure was adeline</s>  he could havelaughed at the irony the mockery of the anticlimax if it had not beenfor the face that the old maid turned upon him at the approach of hisfootfalls and the pleasure that lighted up its pathos when sherecognized him</s> oh mr</s>  hilary</s>  she said and then she could not speak for thetwitching of her lips and the trembling of her chin</s> he took her hand in silence and it seemed natural for him to do thatreverent and tender thing which is no longer a part of our custom hebent over it and kissed the chill bony knuckles</s> she drew her hand away to find her handkerchief and wipe her tears</s>  isuppose youve come to see suzette but shes gone up to the village totalk with mr</s>  putney hes our lawyer</s> yes said matt</s> i presume i dont need to talk to you about thatletter</s>  i thinkandi believe suzette will think so too in the endthat his mind isaffected and he just accuses himself of all these things becausetheyve been burnt into it so</s>  how are your father and mother</s>  and yoursister</s> she broke off with these questions he could see to stay herself inwhat she wished to say</s>  they are all well</s>  father is still in bostonbut mother and louise are at the farm with me</s>  they sent their love andthey are anxious to know if there is anythingthank you</s>  will you sit down here</s>  its so close indoors</s>  she maderoom for him on the threshold but he took the step below</s> i hope miss suzette is well</s> why thank you not very well</s>  there isnt anything really the matterbut we didnt either of us sleep very well last night we were excited</s> i dont know as i ought to tell you she began</s>  i dont suppose its athing you would know about any way but ive got to talk to somebodymiss northwick said matt if there is anything in the world that ican do for you or that you even hope i can do i beg you to let mehear it</s>  i should be glad beyond all words to help you</s> oh i dont know as anything can be done she began after the freshgush of tears which were her thanks but suzette and i have beentalking it over a good deal and we thought we would like to see yourfather about it</s>  you see suzette cant feel right about our keeping theplace here if fathers really done what he says hes done</s>  we dontbelieve he has but if he has he has got to be found somewhere andmade to give up the money he says he has got</s>  suzette thinks we ought togive up the money we have got in the bankfifteen hundred or twothousand dollarsand she wanted i should let her give up her half ofthe place here and at first i did say she might</s>  but come to findout from mr</s>  putney the whole place would have to be sold before itcould be divided and i couldnt seem to let it</s>  that was whatwedisputed about</s>  yes</s>  we had a dispute but its all right now or itwill be when we get the company to say they will stop the lawsuitagainst father if he will give up the money hes got and we will giveup the place</s>  mr</s>  putney seemed to think the company couldnt stop itbut i dont see why a rich corporation like that couldnt do almostanything it wanted to with its money</s> her innocent corruption did not shock matt nor her scheme for defeatingjustice but he smiled forlornly at the hopelessness of it</s>  im afraidmr</s>  putney is right</s>  he was silent and then at the despair that cameinto her face he hurried on to say but i will see my father missnorthwick i will go down to see him at once and if anything can behonorably and fairly done to save your father i am sure he will try todo it for your sake</s>  but dont expect anything he said getting to hisfeet and putting out his hand to her</s> no no i wont she said with gratitude that wrung his heart</s> andwont you wait and see suzette</s> matt reddened</s>  no i think not now</s>  but perhaps i will come backandandi will come soon again</s>  goodby</s> mr</s>  hilary</s>  she called after him</s>  he ran back to her</s>  ifif yourfather dont think anything can be done i dont want he should sayanything about it</s> oh no certainly not</s> and mr</s>  hilary</s>  dont you let suzette know i spoke to you</s>  illtell her</s> why of course</s> on his way to boston the affair seemed to grow less and less impossibleto matt but he really knew nothing of the legal complications and whenhe proposed it to his father old hilary shook his head</s>  i dontbelieve it could be done</s>  the mans regularly indicted and hes incontempt of court as long as he doesnt present himself for trial</s> thats the way i understand it</s>  but ill see our counsel</s>  whose schemeis this</s> i dont know</s>  miss northwick told me of it but i fancied misssuzetteyes said hilary</s>  it must have cost her almost her life to give upher faith in that pitiful rascal</s> but after she had done that it would cost her nothing to give up theproperty and as i understood miss northwick that was her sistersfirst impulse</s>  she wished to give up her half of the estateunconditionally but miss northwick wouldnt consent and theycompromised on the conditions she told me of</s> well said hilary i think miss northwick showed the most sense</s>  butof course sues a noble girl</s>  she almost transfigures that oldscoundrel of a father of hers</s>  that fellowjack wilmingtonought tocome forward now and show himself a man if he is one</s>  any man mightbe proud of such a girls loveand they say she was in love with him</s> but he seems to have preferred to dangle after his uncles wife</s>  heisnt good enough for her and probably he always knew it</s> matt profited by the musing fit that came upon his father to go andlook at the picture over the mantel</s>  it was not a new picture but hedid not feel that he was using his father quite frankly and he keptlooking at it for that reason</s> if those poor creatures gave up their property what would they do</s> theyve absolutely nothing else in the world</s> i fancy said matt that isnt a consideration that would weigh withsuzette northwick</s> no</s>  if theres anything in heredity the father of such a girl musthave some good in him</s>  of course they wouldnt be allowed to suffer</s> do you mean that the company would regard the fact that it had no legalclaim on the property and would recognize it in their behalf</s> the company</s>  hilary roared</s>  the company has no right to thatproperty moral or legal</s>  but we should act as if we had</s>  if it wereunconditionally offered to us we ought to acknowledge it as an act ofcharity to us and not of restitution</s>  but every man jack of us wouldhold out for a right to it that didnt exist and we should take it aspart of our due and i should be such a coward that i couldnt tell theboard what i thought of our pusillanimity</s> it seems rather hard for men to act magnanimously in a corporatecapacity or even humanely said matt</s>  but i dont know but therewould be an obscure and negative justice in such action</s>  it would beright for the company to accept the property if it was right fornorthwicks daughter to offer it and i think it is most unquestionablyright for her to do that</s> do you matt</s>  well well said hilary willing to be comfortedperhaps youre right</s>  you must send louise and your mother over to seeher</s> well perhaps not just now</s>  shes proud and sensitive and perhaps itmight seem intrusive at this juncture</s> intrusive</s>  nonsense</s>  shell be glad to see them</s>  send them right over</s> matt knew this was his fathers way of yielding the point and he wentaway with his promise to say nothing of the matter they had talked oftill he heard from putney</s>  after that would be time enough to ascertainthe whereabouts of northwick which no one knew yet not even his ownchildren</s> what his father had said in praise of suzette gave his love for herunconscious approval but at the same time it created a sort of comedysituation and matt was as far from the comic as he hoped he was fromthe romantic in his mood</s>  when he thought of going direct to her hehated to be going like the hero of a novel to offer himself to theheroine at the moment her fortunes were darkest but he knew that he wasonly like that outwardly and inwardly was simply and humbly her loverwho wished in any way or any measure he might to be her friend andhelper</s>  he thought he might put his offer in some such form as wouldleave her free to avail herself a little if not much of his longing tocomfort and support her in her trial</s>  but at last he saw that he coulddo nothing for the present and that it would be cruel and useless togive her more than the tried help of a faithful friend</s>  he did not goback to hatboro as he longed to do</s>  he went back to his farm andpossessed his soul in such patience as he could</s> xii</s> suzette came back from putneys office with such a disheartened lookthat adeline had not the courage to tell her of matts visit and theerrand he had undertaken for her</s>  the lawyer had said no more than thathe did not believe anything could be done</s>  he was glad they had decidednot to transfer their property to the company without first trying tomake interest for their father with it that was their right and theirduty and he would try what could be done but he warned suzette that heshould probably fail</s> and then what did he think we ought to do</s>  adeline asked</s> he didnt say suzette answered</s> i presume adeline went on after a little pause that you would liketo give up the property anyway</s>  well you can do it suzette</s>  the joyshe might have expected did not show itself in her sisters face andshe added ive thought it all over and i see it as you do now</s> only she quavered i do want to do all i can for poor father first</s> yes said suzette spiritlessly mr</s>  putney said we ought</s> sue said adeline after another little pause i dont know whatyoull think of me for what ive done</s>  mr</s>  hilary has been heremr</s>  hilary</s> yes</s>  he came over from his farmoh</s>  i thought you meant his father</s>  the color began to mount into thegirls cheeks</s> louise and mrs</s>  hilary sent their love and they all want to doanything they can andand i told mr</s>  hilary what we were going to tryandhe said he would speak to his father about it andoh suzetteim afraid ive done more than i ought</s> suzette was silent and then no she said i cant see what harmthere could be in it</s> he said adeline pursued with joyful relief he wouldnt let hisfather speak to the rest about it till we were ready and i know helldo all he can for us</s>  dont you</s> sue answered i dont see what harm it can do for him to speak to hisfather</s>  i hope adeline she added with the severity adeline haddreaded you didnt ask it as a favor from him</s> no no</s>  i didnt indeed sue</s>  it came naturally</s>  he offered to do it</s> well said suzette with a sort of relaxation and she fell back inthe chair where she had been sitting</s> i dont see said adeline with an anxious look at the girls wornface but what wed both better have the doctor</s> ah the doctor</s>  cried suzette</s>  what can the doctor do for troubleslike ours</s>  she put up her hands to her face and bowed herself on themand sobbed with the first tears she had shed since the worst had comeupon them</s> the companys counsel submitted putneys overtures as he expected tothe states attorney in the hypothetical form and the statesattorney as putney expected dealt with the actuality</s>  he said thatwhen northwicks friends communicated with him and ascertained hisreadiness to surrender the money he had with him and to makerestitution in every possible way it would be time to talk of a nolleprosequi</s>  in the meantime by the fact of absconding he was in contemptof court</s>  he must return and submit himself for trial and take thechance of a merciful sentence</s> there could be no other answer he said and he could give none forputney to carry back to the defaulters daughters</s> suzette received it in silence as if she had nerved herself up to bearit so</s>  adeline had faltered between her hopes and fears but she hadapparently decided how she should receive the worst if the worst came</s> well then she said we must give up the place</s>  you can get thepapers ready mr</s>  putney</s> i will do whatever you say miss northwick</s> yes and i dont want you to think that i dont want to do it</s>  its mydoing now and if my sister was all against it i should wish to do itall the same</s> matt hilary learned from his father the result of the conference withthe states attorney and he came up to hatboro the next day to seeputney on his fathers behalf and to express the wish of his familythat mr</s>  putney would let them do anything he could think of for hisclients</s>  he got his message out bunglingly with embarrassedcircumlocution and repetition but this was what it came to in the end</s> putney listened with sarcastic patience shifting the tobacco in hismouth from one thin cheek to the other and letting his fierce blue eyesburn on matts kindly face</s> well sir he said what do you think can be done for two womenbrought up as ladies who choose to beggar themselves</s> is it so bad as that</s>  matt asked</s> why you can judge for yourself</s>  my present instructions are to maketheir whole estate over to the ponkwasset mills companybut i thoughti thought they might have somethingbesidessomethingthere was a little money in the bank that northwick placed there totheir credit when he went away but ive had their instructions to paythat over to your company too</s>  i suppose they will accept it</s> it isnt my company said matt</s>  ive nothing whatever to do withitor any company</s>  but ive no doubt theyll accept it</s> they cant do otherwise said the lawyer with a humorous sense of thepredicament twinkling in his eyes</s>  and that will leave my clients justnothing in the world until mr</s>  northwick comes home with that fortune heproposes to make</s>  in the meantime they have their chance of starving todeath or living on charity</s>  and i dont believe said putney breakingdown with a laugh theyve the slightest notion of doing either</s> matt stood appalled at the prospect which the brute terms brought beforehim</s>  he realized that after all there is no misery like that of wantand that yonder poor girl had chosen something harder to bear than herfathers shame</s> of course he said they mustnt be allowed to suffer</s>  we shall countupon you to see that nothing of that kind happens</s>  you can contrivesomehow not to let them know that they are destitute</s> why said putney putting his leg over the back of a chair into itsseat for his greater ease in conversation i could if i were a lawyerin a novel</s>  but what do you think i can do with two women like thesewho follow me up every inch of the way and want to know just what imean by every step i take</s>  youre acquainted with miss suzette isuppose</s> yes said matt consciously</s> well do you suppose that such a girl as that when she had made up hermind to starve wouldnt know what you were up to if you pretended tohave found a lot of money belonging to her under the cupboard</s> the company must do something said matt desperately</s>  they have noclaim on the property none whatever</s> now youre shouting</s>  putney put a comfortable mass of tobacco in hismouth and began to work his jaws vigorously upon it</s> they mustnt take itthey wont take it</s>  cried matt</s> putney laughed scornfully</s> xiii</s> matt made his way home to his farm by a tiresome series of circuitousrailroad connections across country</s>  he told his mother of the new shapethe trouble of the northwicks had taken and asked her if she could notgo to see them and find out some way to help them</s> louise wished to go instantly to see them</s>  she cried out over the nobleaction that suzette wished to do she knew it was all suzette</s> yes it is noble said mrs</s>  hilary</s>  but i almost wish she wouldnt doit</s> why mamma</s> it complicates matters</s>  they could have gone on living there very wellas they were and the company doesnt need it but now where will theygo</s>  what will become of them</s> louise had not thought of that and she found it shocking</s> i suppose matt said that the company would let them stay where theyare for the present and that they wont be actually houseless</s>  butthey propose now to give up the money that their father left for theirsupport till he could carry out the crazy schemes for retrieving himselfthat he speaks of in his letter and then they will have nothing to liveon</s> i knew suzette would do that</s>  said louise</s>  before that letter cameout she always said that her father never did what the papers said</s>  butthat cut the ground from under her feet and such a girl could have nopeace till she had given up everythingeverything</s> something must be done said mrs</s>  hilary</s>  have theyhas suzetteanyplans</s> none but that of giving up the little money they have left in thebank said matt forlornly</s> well mrs</s>  hilary commented with a sort of magisterial authoritytheyve all managed as badly as they could</s> well mother they hadnt a very hopeful case to begin with saidmatt and louise smiled</s> i suppose your poor father is worried almost to death about it mrs</s> hilary pursued</s> he was annoyed but i couldnt see that he had lost his appetite</s>  idont think that even his worriment is the first thing to be

admitted thinking he would rather like to be of a lightnature himself at that moment</s>  but i dont know that there is anythingwrong in it</s>  it would do no good if she took the matter heavily</s>

shes a strange contradiction</s> mrs</s>  hilary sighed</s>  if she would only be entirely worldly itwouldnt be so difficult but when her mixture of unworldliness comesin its quite distracting</s>  she waited a moment as if to let matt askher what she meant but he did not and she went on shes certainlynot a simple characterlike sue northwick for instance</s> matt now roused himself</s>  is she a simple character</s>  he asked with ashow of indifference</s> perfectly said his mother</s>  she always acts from pride</s>  that explainseverything she does</s> i know she is proud matt admitted finding a certain comfort inopenly recognizing traits in sue northwick that he had never deceivedhimself about</s>  he had a feeling too that he was behaving withsomething like the candor due his mother in saying i could imagineher being imperious even arrogant at times and certainly she is awilful person</s>  but i dont see he added why we shouldnt credit herwith something better than pride in what she proposes to do now</s> she has behaved very well said mrs</s>  hilary and much better thancould have been expected of her fathers daughter</s> matt felt himself getting angry at this scanty justice but he tried toanswer calmly surely mother there must be a point where the blame ofthe innocent ends</s>  i should be very sorry if you went to miss northwickwith the idea that we were conferring a favor in any way</s>  it seems to methat she is indirectly putting us under an obligation which we shallfind it difficult to discharge with delicacy</s> arent you rather fantastic

northwick a chance to save himself and he abusedit and ran away</s>  and if she is not responsible for her father whyshould you feel so for yours</s>  but i think you may trust me matt to dowhat is right and propereven what is delicatewith miss northwick</s> oh yes</s>  i didnt mean that</s> you said something like it my dear</s> then i beg your pardon mother</s>  i certainly wasnt thinking of heralone</s>  but she is proud and i hoped you would let her feel that werealize all that she is doing</s> im afraid said mrs</s>  hilary with a final sigh that if i were quitefrank with her i should

believe ifi keep on getting better at the rate ive been going the last week ishall be able to write a play this summer besides doing my work for theabstract</s>  if i could do that and it succeeded

what do you mean</s> i mean that i should have a handsome income and could give upnewspaper work altogether</s>
could you</s>  how glorious</s>  said louise with the sort of maternalsympathy she permitted herself to feel for the sick youth</s>  how muchwould you get for your play</s> if it was only reasonably

would be a tremendoussituation</s> but i shouldnt like to see him at such a time</s>  it seems to methats worse than interviewing mr</s>  maxwell</s> there was a sort of recoil from him in her tone

such thing as thatit isnt said maxwell</s>  i failed on that</s>  i shall try a comicmotive</s> oh</s>  said louise in the concessive tone people use when they do notknow but they have wronged some one</s>  she spiritually came back to himbut materially she rose to go away and leave him</s>  she stooped for theletter he had dropped out of the hammock and gave it him</s>  dont youwant this</s> oh thank you</s>  id forgotten it</s>  he glanced at the superscriptionits from pinney</s>  you ought to know pinney miss hilary if you wantthe true artistic point of view</s> is he a literary man</s>

said louise leaving him to his letter</s> xv</s> part of matt hilarys protest against the status in which he foundhimself a swell was to wash his face for dinner in a tin basin on theback porch like the farmhands</s>  when he was alone at the farm he hadthe hands eat with him when his mother and sister were visiting him hepretended that the table was too small for them all at dinner and teathough he continued to breakfast with the hands because the ladies werenever up at his hour the hands knew well enough what it meant but theyliked matt</s> louise found him at the rollertowel after his emblematic ablutions</s> oh is it so near dinner</s>  she asked</s> yes</s>  where is maxwell</s> i left him up at the camp</s>  she walked a little way out into thegroundivy that matted the backyard under the scattering spruce trees</s> matt followed and watched the homing and departing bees around thehives in the deep redclovered grass near the wall</s> those fellows will be swarming before long he said with a measure ofthe good comradeship he felt for all living things</s> i dont see said louise plucking a tender green shoot from one ofthe fir boughs overhead why mr</s>  maxwell is so hard</s> is he hard</s>  asked matt</s>  well perhaps he is</s> he is very sneering and bitter said the girl</s>  i dont like it</s> ah hes to blame for that matt said</s>  but as for his hardness thatprobably comes from his having had to make such a hard fight for what hewants to be in life</s>  that hardens people and brutalizes them butsomehow we mostly admire them and applaud them for their success againstodds</s>  if we had a true civilization a man wouldnt have to fight for thechance to do the thing he is fittest for that is to be himself</s>  butim glad you dont like maxwells hardness i dont myself</s> he seems to look upon the whole world as material as he calls it hedoesnt seem to regard people as fellow beings as you do matt or evenas servants or inferiors he hasnt so much kindness for them as that</s> well thats the odious side of the artistic nature said mattsmiling tolerantly</s>  but hell probably get over that hes very younghe thinks he has to be relentlessly literary now</s> hes older than i am</s>  said louise</s> he hasnt seen so much of the world</s> he thinks hes seen a great deal more</s>  i dont think hes half so niceas we supposed</s>  i should call him dangerous</s> oh i shouldnt say that exactly matt returned</s>  but he certainlyhasnt our traditions</s>  ill just step over and call him to dinner</s> oh no</s>  let me try if i can blow the horn</s>  she ran to where the longtin tube hung on the porch and coming out with it again set it to herlips and evoked some stertorous and crumby notes from it</s>  do yousuppose he saw me</s>  she asked running back with the horn</s> matt could not say but maxwell had seen her and had thought of a poemwhich he imagined illustrated with the figure of a tall beautiful girllifting a long tin horn to her lips with outstretched arms</s>  he did notknow whether to name it simply the dinner horn or grotesquely hebecalling the gods to nectar</s>  he debated the question as he came laggingover the grass with his cushion in one hand and pinneys letter stillopened in the other</s>  he said to matt who came out to get the cushionof him heres something id like to talk over with you when youvethe time</s> well after dinner said matt</s> pinneys letter was a long one written in pencil on one side of longslips of paper like printers copy the slips were each carefullyfolioed in the upper right hand corner but the language was thelanguage of pinneys life and not the decorative diction which heusually addressed to the public on such slips of paper</s> i guess it began ive got onto the biggest thing yet maxwell</s>  theevents is going to send me to do the social science congress whichmeets in quebec this year and im going to take mrs</s>  pinney along andhave a good time</s>  shes got so she can travel firstrate now and thechange will do her and the baby both good</s>  i shall interview the socialscience wiseacres and do their proceedings of course but the thingthat im onto is northwick</s>  ive always felt that northwick kind ofbelonged to yours truly anyway i was the only man that worked him upin any sort of shape at the time the defalcation came out and ive gota little idea that i think will simply clean out all competition</s>  thatletter of his set me to thinking as soon as i read it and my wife andi both happened on the idea at the same time clear case of telepathy</s> our idea is that northwick didnt go to europeof course hedidnt</s> but hes just holding out for terms with the company</s>  i dontbelieve hes got off with much money but if he was going into businesswith it in canada he would have laid low till hed made hisinvestments</s>  so my theory is that hes got all the money he took withhim except his living expenses</s>  i believe i can find northwick and i amnot going to come home without trying hard</s>  i am going to have adetectives legal outfit and i flatter myself i can get northwick overthe frontier somehow and restore him to the arms of his anxious friendsof the ponkwasset company</s>  i dont know yet just how i shall do it buti guess i shall do it</s>  i shall have mrs</s>  pinneys advice and counseland shes a team but i shall have to leave her and the baby at quebecwhile im roaming round in rimouski and the wilderness generally and ishall need active help</s> now i liked some things in that abstract article of yours it wassnappy and literary and all that and it showed grasp of the subject</s> it showed a humane and merciful spirit toward our honored friend thatcould be made to tell in my little game if i could get the use of it</s>  soive concluded to let you in on the ground floor if you want to go intothe enterprise with me if you dont dont give it away thats all</s>  myidea is that northwick can be got at quicker by two than by one but wehave not only got to get at him but we have got to get him and gethim on this side of jordan</s>  i guess we shall have to do that by moralsuasion mostly and thats where your massive and penetrating intellectwill be right on deck</s>  you wont have to play a part either if youbelieve that his only chance of happiness on earth is to come home andspend the rest of his life in states prison you can conscientiouslywork him from that point of view</s>  seriously maxwell i think this is agreat chance</s>  if theres any of that money he speaks of we shall haveour pickings and then as a mere scoop if we get at northwick at allwhether we can coax him over the line or not we will knock out thefellow that fired the ephesian dome so that hell never come to time inall eternity</s> i mean business maxwell i havent mentioned this to anybody but mywife yet and if you dont go in with me nobody shall</s>  i want youold boy and im willing to pay for you</s>  if this thing goes through ishall be in a position to name my own place and price on the events</s>  iexpect to be managing editor before the years out and then i shallsecure the best talent as leading writer which his name is brice e</s> maxwell and dont you forget it</s> now you think it over maxwell</s>  theres no hurry</s>  take time</s>  weve gotto wait till the soc</s>  sci</s>  congress meets anyway and weve got to letthe professional pursuit die out</s>  this letter of northwicks will set alot of detectives after him and if they cant find him or cant workhim after theyve found him theyll get tired and give him up for abad job</s>  then will be the time for the gifted amateur to step in andshow what a free and untrammelled press can do to punish vice and rewardvirtue</s> xvi</s> maxwell explained to matt as he had explained to louise that pinneywas the reporter who had written up the northwick case for the events</s> he said after matt had finished reading the letter i thought youwould like to know about this</s>  i dont regard pinneys claim on mysilence where youre concerned in fact i dont feel bound to himanyway</s> thank you said matt</s>  then i suppose his proposal doesnt tempt you</s> why yes it does</s>  but not as he imagines</s>  i should like such anadventure well enough because it would give me a glimpse of life andcharacter that i should like to know something about</s>  but the reporterbusiness and the detective business wouldnt attract me</s> no i should suppose not said matt</s>  what sort of fellow personallyis thispinney</s> oh he isnt bad</s>  he is a regular type said maxwell with tacitenjoyment of the typicality of pinney</s>  he hasnt the least chance inthe world of working up into any controlling place in the paper</s>  theydont know much in the events office but they do know pinney</s>  hes agreat liar and a braggart and he has no more notion of the immunitiesof private life thanwell perhaps its because he would as soon turnhis life inside out as not and in fact would rather</s>  but hes verydomestic and very kindhearted to his wife it seems they have a babynow and ive no doubt pinney is a pattern to parents</s>  hes alwaysadvising you to get married but hes a born bohemian</s>  hes the mostharmless creature in the world so far as intentions go and quitesofthearted but he wouldnt spare his dearest friend if he could makecopy of him it would be impossible</s>  i should say he was first anewspaper man and then a man</s>  hes an awfully common nature and hasntthe first literary instinct</s>  if i had any mystery or mere privacy thati wanted to guard and i thought pinney was on the scent of it ishouldnt have any more scruple in setting my foot on him than i wouldon that snake</s> a little reptile allured by their immobility had crept out of thestone wall which they were standing near and lay flashing its keen eyesat them and running out its tongue a forked thread of tremulousscarlet</s>  maxwell brought his heel down upon its head as he spoke andground it into the earth</s> matt winced at the anguish of the twisting and writhing thing</s>  ah idont think i should have killed it</s> i should said maxwell</s> then you think one couldnt trust him</s> yes</s>  if you put your foot on him in some sort of agreement and kept itthere</s>  why of course</s>  any man can be held</s>  but dont let pinney haveroom to wriggle</s> they turned and walked away matt keeping the image of the tormentedsnake in his mind it somehow mixed there with the idea of pinney andunconsciously softened him toward the reporter</s> would there be any harm he asked after a while in my acting on aknowledge of this letter in behalf of mr</s>  northwicks family</s> not a bit said maxwell</s>  i make you perfectly free of it as far asim concerned and it cant hurt pinney even if he ought to be spared</s> he wouldnt spare you</s> i dont know said matt that i could justify myself in hurting himon that ground</s>  i shall be careful about him</s>  i dont at all know that ishall want to use it but it has just struck me that perhapsbut idont know</s>  i should have to talk with their attorneyi will see aboutit</s>  and i thank you very much mr</s>  maxwell</s> look here mr</s>  hilary</s>  said maxwell</s>  use pinney all you please andall you can but i warn you he is a dangerous tool</s>  he doesnt mean anyharm till hes tempted and when its done he doesnt think its anyharm</s>  he isnt to be trusted an instant beyond his selfinterest andyet he has flashes of unselfishness that would deceive the very elect</s> good heavens</s>  cried maxwell if i could get such a character aspinneys into a story or a play i wouldnt take odds from any manliving</s> his notion whatever it was grew upon matt so that he waited more andmore impatiently for his mothers return in order to act upon it</s>  whenshe did get back to the farm she could only report from the northwicksthat she had said pretty much what she thought she would like to say tosuzette concerning her wilfulness and obstinacy in wishing to give upher property but matt inferred that she had at the same time been ableto infuse so much motherly comfort into her scolding that it had leftthe girl consoled and encouraged</s>  she had found out from adeline thattheir great distress was not knowing yet where their father was</s> apparently he thought that his published letter was sufficientreassurance for the time being</s>  perhaps he did not wish them to get athim in any way or to have his purposes affected by any appeal fromthem</s>  perhaps as adeline firmly believed his mind had been warped byhis sufferinghe must have suffered greatlyand he was not able toreason quite sanely about the situation</s>  mrs</s>  hilary spoke of thedignity and strength which both the sisters showed in their trial andpresent stress</s>  she praised suzette especially she said her troubleseemed to have softened and chastened her she was really a noble girland she had sent her love to louise they had both wished to beremembered to every one</s>  adeline especially wished to be rememberedto you matt she said they should never forget your kindness</s> matt got over to hatboro the next day and went to see putney whoreceived him with some ironical politeness when matt said he had comehoping to be useful to his clients the miss northwicks</s> well we all hope something of that kind mr</s>  hilary</s>  you were here ona mission of that kind before</s>  but may i ask why you think i shouldbelieve you wish to be useful to them</s> why</s> yes</s>  your father is the president of the company mr</s>  northwick had hislittle embarrassment with and the natural presumption would be that youcould not really be friendly toward his family</s> but we are friendly</s>  all of us</s>  my father would do them any servicein his power consistent with his duty totohis business associates</s> ah thats just the point</s>  and you would all do anything you could forthem consistent with your duty to him</s>  thats perfectlyrightperfectly natural</s>  but you must see that it doesnt form a groundof common interest for us</s>  i talked with you about the miss northwicksaffairs the other daytoo much i think</s>  but i cant today</s>  i shall beglad to converse with you on any other topicdiscuss the ways of god toman or any little interest of that kind</s>  but unless i can see my wayclearer to confidence between us in regard to my clients affairs than ido at present i must avoid them</s> it was absurd but in his high goodwill toward adeline and in hislatent tenderness for suzette matt was hurt by the lawyers distrustsomewhat as you are hurt when the cashier of a strange bank turns overyour check and says you must bring some one to recognize you</s>  it costmatt a pang it took him a moment to own that putney was right</s>  then hesaid of course i must offer you proof somehow that ive come to youin good faith</s>  i dont know exactly how i shall be able to do it</s>  wouldthe assurance of my friend mr</s>  wade the rector of st</s>  michaelsthe name seemed to affect putney pleasantly he smiled and then hesaid brother wade is a good man and his words usually carryconviction but this is a serious subject mr</s>  hilary</s>  he laughed andconcluded earnestly you must know that i cant talk with you on anysuch authority</s>  i couldnt talk with mr</s>  wade himself</s> no no of course not matt assented and he took himself offcrestfallen ashamed of his own shortsightedness</s> there was only one way out of the trouble and now he blamed himself fornot having tried to take that way at the outset</s>  he had justifiedhimself in shrinking from it by many plausible excuses but he couldjustify himself no longer</s>  he rejoiced in feeling compelled as it wereto take it</s>  at least now he should not be acting from any selfishimpulse and if there were anything unseemly in what he was going to dohe should have no regrets on that score even in the shame of failure</s> xvii</s> matt hilary gave himself time on his way to the northwick place or atleast as much time as would pass between walking and driving but thatwas because he was impatient and his own going seemed faster to hisnerves than that of the swiftest horse could have seemed</s>  at the crestof the upland which divides hatboro from south hatboro and justbeyond the avenue leading to dr</s>  morrells house he met sue northwickshe was walking quickly too</s>  she was in mourning but she had put asideher long crape veil and she came towards him with her proud faceframed in the black and looking the paler for it a little of heryellow hair showed under her bonnet</s>  she moved imperiously and matt wasafraid to think what he was thinking at sight of her</s>  she seemed not toknow him at first or rather not to realize that it was he when shedid a joyful light which she did not try to hide from him flashedover her

very old and frail as she sat nervously rockingherself in a corner of the cottage parlor and her voice had a sharpanxious note</s>  what i think is that now we know father is alive weoughtnt to do anything about the property without hearing from him</s>  itstands to reason dont you think it does mr</s>  hilary that he wouldknow better than anybody else what we ought to do</s>  any rate i think weought to wait and consult with him about it and see what he says</s>  theproperty belonged to mother in the first place and he mightnt like tohave us part with it</s> i dont think you need trouble about that now miss northwick saidmatt</s>  nothing need be done about the property at present</s> but i keep thinking about it</s>  i want to do what sue thinks is rightand to see it just in the

suzette</s>  where are you</s> sue released herself and ran into the cottage</s>  she came out again in alittle while and said that the doctor thought adeline had better go tobed for a day or two and

dismissal already of the order of things</s>  he said yes ill go atonce</s>  but aboutshe put a card into his hand</s>  you can see mr</s>  putney and whatever youand he think best will be best</s>  havent you been our good angel eversinceoh im not half good enough for you and i shouldnt be even ifthere were no stainstop</s>  he said he caught her hand and pulled her toward him</s> the doctor

good many becausehes a man that thinks and then says what he thinks</s>  but hes his ownworst enemy because from time to time he gets drunk</s> a character said matt</s>  do you think hes a safe one</s>  doesnt hisgetting drunk from time to time interfere with his usefulness</s> well of course said the doctor</s>  its bad for him but i think itsslowly getting better</s>  yes decidedly</s>  its very extraordinary but eversince hes been in charge of the miss northwicks interestsyes thats what i was thinking of</s> hes kept perfectly straight</s>  its as if the responsibilities hadsteadied him</s> but if he goes on sprees he may be on the verge of one thatsgathering violence from its postponement matt suggested</s> i think not said the doctor after a moment</s>  but of course i canttell</s> they trust him so implicitly said matt</s> i know said the doctor</s>  and i know that hes entirely devoted tothem</s>  the fact is putneys a very dear friend of mine</s> oh excuse meno no</s>  the doctor stayed matts apologies</s>  i understand just whatyou mean</s>  he disliked their father very much</s>  he was principled againsthim as a merely rich man with mischievous influence on the imaginationsof all the poor people about him who wanted to be like himoh thats rather good said matt</s> do you think so</s>  asked the doctor looking round at him</s>  well</s>  isupposed you would be all the other way</s>  well</s>  what i was saying wasthat putney looks upon these poor girls as their fathers chief victims</s> i think he was touched by their coming to him and has pitied them</s>  theimpression is that hes managed their affairs very well i dont knowabout such things but i know hes managed them honorably i would stakemy life on it and i believe hell hold out straight to the last</s>  isuppose the doctor conjectured at the end that they will try to getat northwick now and arrange with his creditors for his return</s> i dont mind telling you said matt that its been tried and failed</s> the states attorney insists that he shall come back and stand histrial first of all</s> oh</s>  said the doctor</s> of course thats right from the legal point of view</s>  but in themeantime nobody knows where mr</s>  northwick is</s> i suppose said the doctor it would have been better for him not tohave written that letter</s> its hard to say matt answered</s>  i thought so too at first</s>  ithought it was cowardly and selfish of him to take away his childrenssuperstition about his honesty</s>  you knew that they held to that throughall</s> most touching thing in the world said the doctor leaning forward topush a fly off his horse with the limp point of his whip</s>  that poor oldmaid has talked it into me till i almost believed it myself</s> i dont know that i should hold him severely accountable</s>  and im notsure now that i should condemn him for writing that letter</s>  it must havebeen a great relief to him</s>  in a way you may say he had to do it</s> its conceivable that if he had kept it on his mind any longer his mindwould have given way</s>  as it is they have now the comfort of anothersuperstitionif it is a superstition</s>  what do you think doctor</s>  do youbelieve that there was a mental twist in him</s> there seems to be in nearly all these defaulters</s>  what they do is sosenselessso insane</s>  i suppose thats the true theory of all crime</s>  butit wont do to act upon it yet awhile</s> no</s> the doctor went on after a pause with a laugh of enjoyment at thenotion</s>  above all it wont do to let the defaulters act upon thattheory and apply for admission to the insane asylums instead of takingthe express for canada when theyre found out</s> oh no said matt</s>  he wondered at himself for being able to analyzethe offence of suzettes father so coldbloodedly</s>  but in fact he couldnot relate the thought of her to the thought of him in his sin at allhe could only realize their kindred in her share of his suffering</s> xix</s> putney accepted suzettes authorization of matt with apparentunconsciousness of anything but its immediate meaning and they talkedpinneys scheme intimately over together</s>  in the end it still remaineda question whether the energies of such an investigator could beconfined to the discovery of northwicks whereabouts whether hisnewspaper instincts would not be too strong for any sense of personaladvantage that could be appealed to in him</s>  they both believed that itwould not be long before northwick followed up the publication of hisletter by some communication with his family</s> but time began to go by again and northwick made no further sign theflurry of activity which his letter had called out in the detectivescame to nothing</s>  their search was not very strenuous northwickscreditors were of various minds as to the amount of money he had carriedaway with him</s>  every one knew that if he chose to stay in canada hecould not be molested there and it seemed very improbable that he couldbe persuaded to put himself within reach of the law</s>  the law had noterms to offer him and there was really nothing to be done</s> putney forecast all this in his talk with matt when he held that theymust wait northwicks motion</s>  he professed himself willing to wait aslong as northwick chose though he thought they would not have to waitlong and he contended for a theory of the mans whole performance whichhe said he should like to have tested before a jury</s> matt could not make out how much he really meant by saying thatnorthwick could be defended very fairly on the ground of insanity andthat he would enjoy managing such a defence</s>  it was a common thing toshow that a murderer was insane why not a defaulter</s>  tilted back in hischair with one leg over the corner of his table and changing thetobacco in his mouth from one cheek to the other as he talked thelawyer outlined the argument which he said could be made very effective</s> there was the fact to begin with that northwick was a very wealthy manand had no need of more money when he began to speculate putney heldthat this want of motive could be made a strong point and that thereckless almost open way in which northwick used the companys moneywhen he began to borrow was proof in itself of unsound mind apparentlyhe had no sense whatever of meum and tuum especially tuum</s>  thenthe total collapse of the man when he was found out his flight withoutan effort to retrieve himself although his shortage was by no meanshopelessly vast and could have been almost made up by skilful use ofthe credit that northwick could command was another evidence of shakenreason</s>  but besides all this there was his behavior since he left home</s> he had been absent nearly five months and in that time he had made noattempt whatever to communicate with his family although he must haveknown that it was perfectly safe for him to do so</s>  he was a father whowas almost dotingly fond of his children and singularly attached to hishome yet he had remained all that time in voluntary exile and he hadleft them in entire uncertainty as to his fate except so far as theycould accept the probability of his death by a horrible casualty</s>  thisinversion of the natural character of a man was one of the most strikingphenomena of insanity and putney for the purpose of argumentmaintained that it could be made to tell tremendously with a jury</s> matt was unable to enjoy the sardonic metaphysics of the case withputney</s>  he said gravely that he had been talking of the matter with dr</s> morrell and he had no doubt that there was a taint of insanity in everywrongdoer some day he believed the law would take cognizance of thefact</s> i dont suppose the time is quite ripe yet though i think i could makeout a strong case for brother northwick said putney</s>  he seemed toenter into it more fully as if he had a mischievous perception ofmatts uneasiness and chose to torment him but then apparently hechanged his mind and dealt with other aspects of their common interestso seriously and sympathetically that matt parted from him with aregret that he could not remove the last barrier between them and tellthe lawyer that he concerned himself so anxiously in the affairs of thatwretched defaulter because his dearest hope was that the daughter of thecriminal would some day be his wife</s> but matt felt that this fact must first be confided to those who werenearest him and how to shape it in terms that would convey the fact andyet hide the repulsiveness he knew in it was the question that teasedhim all the way back to vardley like some tiresome riddle</s>  heunderstood why his love for suzette northwick must be grievous to hisfather and mother how embarrassing how disappointing how really insome sort disastrous and yet he felt that if there was anything moresacred than another in the world for him it was that love he must betrue to it at whatever cost and in every event and he must begin bybeing perfectly frank with those whom it would afflict and confessingto himself all its difficulties and drawbacks</s>  he was not much afraid ofdealing with his father they were both men and they could look at itfrom the mans point of view</s>  besides his father really cared littlewhat people would say after the first fever of disgust if he did notchange wholly and favor it vehemently he would see so much good in itthat he would be promptly and finally reconciled</s> but matt knew that his mother was of another make and that the blowwould be much harder for her to bear his problem was how to lighten it</s> sometimes he thought he had better not try to lighten it but let itfall at once and trust to her affection and good sense for the rest</s> but when he found himself alone with her that night he began by makingplay and keeping her beyond reach</s>  he was so lost in this perverseeffort that he was not aware of some such effort on her part till shesuddenly dropped it and said matt there is something i wish to speakto you aboutvery seriously</s> his heart jumped into his throat but he said well</s>  and she went on</s> louise tells me that you think of bringing this young man down to theshore with you when you come to see us next week</s> maxwell</s>  i thought the change might do him good yes said matt witha cowardly joy in his escape from the worst he feared</s>  he thought shewas going to speak to him of suzette</s> she said i dont wish you to bring him</s>  i dont wish louise to see himagain after she leaves this placeever again</s>  she is fascinated withhim</s> fascinated</s> i cant call it anything else</s>  i dont say that shes in love buttheres no question but shes allowed her

that herthoughts are with him when theyre apart</s>  he puzzles her he piques hershes always talking and asking about him</s>  its their difference ineverything that does it</s>  i dont mean to say that her heart is touchedand i dont intend it shall be</s>  so you mustnt ask him to the shorewith you and if youve asked him already you must get out of it</s>  ifyou think he needs sea air you can get him board at some of theresorts</s>  but not near us</s>  she asked in default of any response fromher son you dont think matt it would be well for the acquaintanceto go on</s> no i dont mother youre quite right as to that said matt ifyoure not mistaken in supposingim not you may depend upon it</s>  and im glad you can see the matterfrom my point of view</s>  it is all very well for you to have your queeropinions and even to live them</s>  i think its all ridiculous but yourfather and i both respect you for your sincerity though your course hasbeen a great disappointment to us</s> i know that mother said matt groaning in spirit to think how muchworse the disappointment he was meditating must be and feeling himselfdishonest and cowardly through and through</s> but i feel sure mrs</s>  hilary went on that when its a question ofyour sister you would wish her life to be continued on the same planeand in the surroundings she had always been used to</s> i should think that best certainly for a girl of louises ideassaid matt trying to get his own to the surface</s> ideas</s>  cried his mother</s>  she has no ideas</s>  she merely has impulsesand her impulses are to do what people wish</s>  but her education andbreeding have been different from those of such a young man and shewould be very unhappy with him</s>  they never could quite understand eachother no matter how much they were in love</s>  i know he is very talentedand all that and i shouldnt at all mind his being poor</s>  i never mindedcyril wades being poor when i thought he had taken her fancy becausehe was one of ourselves and this young manmatt you cant pretendthat with all his intellectual qualities hes what one calls agentleman</s>  with his origin and bringing up his coarse experiences allhis

all the way home andnow throughout what he and his mother had been saying of maxwell andlouise</s>  but it always seemed impossible and more and more impossibleso that when he found the words spoken

himself over the wall and allowed her toscramble after him</s> she asked herself whether if he had the traditions of a society man hewould have done that but somehow when she looked at his dreamy

newspapersensation out of his discovery</s>  he was willing to forego this in theinterest of northwicks family if it could be made worth his while hesaid he had always sympathized with his family and mrs</s>  pinney had andhe would be glad to be of use to them</s>  he was so far from conceivingthat his account of the defalcation in the events could have beendispleasing to them that he bore them none of an offenders malice</s>  hereferred to his masterpiece in proof of his interest and he promptlyagreed with matt as to the terms of his visit to canada and its object</s> it was in fact the more practicable because since he had written tomaxwell there had been a change in his plans and expectations</s>  pinneywas disappointed in the events people they had not seen his proposedexcursion as he had the failure of northwicks letter as anenterprise had dashed their interest in him and they did not care toinvest in pinneys scheme even so far as to guarantee his expenses</s> this disgusted pinney and turned his thoughts strongly toward anothercalling</s>  it was not altogether strange to him he had already done someminor pieces of amateur detective work and acquitted himself withgratifying success and he had lately seen a private detective whoattested his appreciation of pinneys skill by offering him apartnership</s>  his wife was not in favor of his undertaking the workthough she could not deny that he had some distinct qualification forit</s>  the air of confidence which he diffused about him unconsciously andwhich often served him so well in newspaper life was in itself the mostvaluable property that a detective could have</s>  she said this and shedid not object to the profession itself except for the dangers that shebelieved it involved</s>  she did not

same hotel where northwickhad stopped in the winter but it had kept no recognizable trace of himin the name of warwick on its register</s>  pinney passed a week of searchin the city where he had to carry on his investigations with an eye notonly to northwicks discovery but to his concealment as well</s>  if hecould find him he must hide him from the pursuit of others and he wentabout his work in the journalistic rather than the legal way</s>  he had notwholly severed his connection as the newspaper phrase is with theevents</s>  he had a fast and loose relation with it pending a closer tiewith his friend the detective which authorized him to keep its name onhis card and he was soon friends with all the gentlemen of the localpress</s>  they did not understand in their oldfashioned quiet ideal ofnewspaper work the vigor with which pinney proposed to enjoy theleisure of his vacation in exploiting all the journalistic materialrelating to the financial exiles resident in their city</s>

which the citizens were verywell aware of</s>  there are defaulters and defaulters and the blame is notin all cases the same nor the breeding of the offenders</s>  pinney learnedthat there were defaulters who were in society and not merely becausethey were defaulters for large sums and were of good social standing athome but because there were circumstances that attenuated their offencein the eyes of the people of their city of refuge they judged them bytheir known intentions and their exigencies as the justice they hadfled from could not judge them</s>  there were other defaulters of adifferent type and condition whose status followed them embezzlers whohad deliberately planned their misdeeds and who had fallen from nodomestic dignity in their exclusion from respectable association abroad</s> these pinney saw in their walks about the town and he was not tooproud for the purposes of art to make their acquaintance and to studyin their vacancy and solitude the dulness and weariness of exile</s>  theydid not consort together but held aloof from one another and professedto be ignorant each of the affairs of the rest</s>  pinney sympathized intone if not in sentiment with them but he did not lure them to theconfidence he so often enjoyed they proved to be men of reticenttemper when frankly invited to speak of their history and their hopesin the interest of the reputations they had left behind them they saidthey had no statement to make</s> it was not from them that pinney could hope to learn anything of the manhe was seeking northwick was not of their order morally or sociallyand from the polite circles where the more elect of the exiles movedpinney was himself excluded by the habits of his life and by the choiceof the people who formed those circles</s>  this seemed to pinney rathercomical and it might have led him to say some satirical things of thelocal society if it had been in him to say bitter things at all</s>  as itwas it amused his inexhaustible amiability that an honest man likehimself should not be admitted to the company of even the swellestdefaulters when he was willing to seek it</s>  he regretted that it shouldbe so mainly because northwick could have been heard of among them ifat all and when all his other efforts to trace him at quebec failed hedid not linger there</s>  in fact he had not expected to find him there buthe had begun his search at that point because he must stop there on hisway to rimouski where northwicks letter to the events was posted</s> this postmark was the only real clue he had but he left no stoneunturned at quebec lest northwick should be under it</s>  by the time hecame to the end of his endeavors mrs</s>  pinney and the baby were on suchfriendly terms with the landlady of the hotel where they were stayingthat pinney felt as easy at parting from them as he could ever hope tofeel</s>  his soft heart of husband and father was torn at leaving thembehind but he did not think it well to take them with him not knowingwhat rimouski might be like or how long he might be kept remote from anenglishspeaking or englishpractising doctor</s>  he got a passage downthe river on one of the steamers for liverpool and with many vows incompliance with his wifes charges that he would not let the vessel byany chance carry him on to europe he rent himself away</s>  she wagged thebabys hand at him from the window where she stood to watch him gettinginto the calash and the vision of her there shone in his tears as thecalash dashed wildly down mountain hill street and whirled him throughthe lower town on to the steamers landing</s>  he went to his stateroom assoon as he got aboard that he might give free course to his heartacheand form resolutions to be morally worthy of getting back alive to themand of finding them well</s>  he would if he could have given up his wholeenterprise and he was only supported in it by remembering what she hadsaid in praise of its object</s>  she had said that if he could be the meansof finding their father for those two poor women she should think itthe greatest thing that ever was and more to be glad of than if hecould restore him to his creditors</s>  pinney had laughed at this womanishview of it he had said that in either case it would be business andnothing else but now his heart warmed with acceptance of it as the onlyright view</s>  he pledged himself to it in anticipative requital of theprovidence that was to bring them all together again alive and wellgood as he had felt himself to be when he thought of the love in whichhe and his wife were bound he had never experienced so deep andthorough a sense of desert as in this moment</s>  he must succeed if onlyto crown so meritorious a marriage with the glory of success and foundit in lasting prosperity</s> ii</s> these emotions still filled pinney to the throat when at last he lefthis cabin and went forward to the smokingroom where he found a numberof

palestrawcolored liquid before them</s>  in a group of these the principalspeaker seemed to be an american the two men who chorused him werecanadians they laughed and applauded with enjoyment of what

toinvest</s> why yes that was the curious thing about it he had a belt full ofthousanddollar bills round him</s>  they found it when he was sick and oldoiseau was so afraid that something would happen to him and he wouldbe suspected of it that he nursed him like a brother till he got welland as soon as he was able to get away he bounced him</s> and what do you suppose was the matter with him that he wouldnt evengo to look at oiseaus soapmine</s> well said the american closing his eyes for the better enjoyment ofthe analysis and giving a long slow pull at his cigar there mighthave been any one of several things</s>  my idea is that he was a defaulterand the thousanddollar billsthere were forty or fifty of them oiseausayswere part of the money he got away with</s>  then very likely he hadno faith in oiseauknew it was probably a soapmine and was justputting him off till he could get away himself</s>  or maybe his fever lefthim a little cracked and he didnt know exactly what he was about</s> then again if my theory of what the man was is true i think that kindof fellow gets a twist simply from what hes done</s>  a good many of themmust bring money away with them and there are business openingseverywhere but you never hear of their going into anything over here</s> that is odd said the canadian</s> or would be if it were not so common</s>  its the rule here and i dontknow an exception</s>  the defaulter never does anything with his moneyexcept live on it</s>  meigs who built those railroads on the andes is theonly one who ever showed enterprise and i never understood that it wasa private enterprise with him</s>  anyway the american defaulter who goesto canada never makes any effort to grow up with the country</s>  he simplyrests on his laurels or else employs his little savings to negotiate asafe return</s>  no sir theres something in defalcation that saps a mansbusiness energies and i dont suppose that old fellow would have beenable to invest in oiseaus gold mine if it had opened at his feet andhe could have seen the sovereigns ready coined in it</s>  he justcouldnt</s>  i can understand that state of mind though i dont pretendto respect it</s>  i can imagine just how the man trembled to go into somespeculation and didnt dare to</s>  must have been an old hand at it too</s> but it seems as if the money he steals becomes sacred to a man when hegets away with it and he cant risk it</s> i rather think you could have overcome his scruples markham if youcould have got at him said the canadian</s> perhaps markham assented</s>  but i guess i can do better with our stockin england</s> pinney had let his cigar go out in his excitement</s>  he asked markham fora light though there were plenty of matches and markham accepted therequest as an overture to his acquaintance</s> brother yank</s>  he suggested</s> boston</s> going over</s>
only to rimouski</s>  you dont happen to know the name of that defaulterdo you</s> no i dont said markham</s> i had an idea i knew who it was said pinney</s> markham looked sharply at him</s>  after somebody in rimouski</s> well not just in that sense exactly if you mean as a detective</s>  butim a newspaper man and this is my holiday and im working up a littlearticle about our financiers in exile while im resting</s>  my namespinney</s> markham can fill you up with the latest facts said the canadiangoing out and hes got a gold mine that beats oiseaus hollow</s>  butdont trust him too far</s>  i know him hes a partner of mine</s> that accounts for me said markham with the tolerant light of amuchjoked joker in his eyes</s>  with pinney alone he ceased to talk theamerican which seemed to please his canadian friend and was willingsoberly to tell all he knew about oiseaus capitalist whom he merelyconjectured to be a defaulter</s>  he said the man called himself warwickand professed to be from chicago and then pinney recalled the name andaddress in the register of his quebec hotel and the date which wasabout that of northwicks escape</s>  but i never dreamt of his using halfof his real name and he told markham what the real name was and thenhe thought it safe to trust him with the nature of his special missionconcerning northwick</s> is there any place on board where a man could go and kick himself</s>  heasked</s> do it here as well as anywhere said markham breaking his cigarashoff</s>  but pinneys alluring confidence and his simpleheartedacknowledgment of his lack of perspicacity had told upon him he feltthe fascinating need of helping pinney which pinney was able to inspirein those who respected him least and he said there was a priest whoknew this man when he was at haha bay and i believe he has a parishnowyes he has</s>  i remember oiseau told meat rimouski</s>  youd betterlook him up</s> look him up</s>  said pinney in a frenzy</s>  ill live with him beforeim in rimouski twenty seconds</s> he had no trouble in finding pre tienne but after the first hopefulencounter with the sunny surface sweetness of the young priest he foundhim disposed to be reserved concerning the mr</s>  warwick he had known athaha bay</s>  it became evident that pre tienne took pinney for adetective and however willing he might have been to save a soul forparadise in the person of the man whose unhappiness he had witnessed hewas clearly not eager to help hunt a fugitive down for states prison</s> even when pinney declared his true character and mission the priestscaution exacted all the proofs he could give and made him submit hisauthorization to an englishspeaking notary of the priestsacquaintance</s>  then he owned that he had seen mr</s>  warwick since theirparting at haha bay mr</s>  warwick had followed him to rimouski afterseveral weeks and pre tienne knew where he was then living</s>  but hewas still so anxious to respect the secrecy of a man who had trusted himas far as northwick had that it required all the logic and all thelearning of the notary to convince him that mr</s>  warwick if he were thelargest defaulter ever selfbanished was in no danger of extradition atpinneys hands</s>  it was with many injunctions and upon many promisesthat at last he told pinney where mr</s>  warwick was living and furnishedhim with a letter which was at once warrant and warning to the exile</s> pinney took the first train back toward quebec he left it at st</s>  andrand crossed the st</s>  lawrence to malbaie</s>  he had no trouble there infinding the little hostelry where mr</s>  warwick lodged</s>  but pinneysspirit though not of the greatest delicacy had become sensitizedtoward the defaulter through the scrupulous regard for him shown by pretienne no loss than by the sense of holding almost a filial relation tohim in virtue of his childrens authorization</s>  so his heart smote him atthe ghastly look he got when he advanced upon warwick where he sat atthe inndoor in the morning sun and cheerily addressed him mr</s> northwick i believe</s> it was the first time northwick had heard his real name spoken sinceputney had threatened him in the station the dark february morning whenhe fled from home</s>  the name he had worn for the last five months wassuddenly no part of him though till that moment it had seemed as muchso as the white beard which he had suffered to hide his face</s>
i dont expect you to answer me said pinney feeling the need oftaking as well as giving time till youve looked at this letter andof course ive no wish to hurry you</s>  if im mistaken and it isnt mr</s> northwick you wont open the letter</s> he handed him not the letter which pre tienne had given him but theletter suzette northwick had written her father and pinney saw that herecognized the handwriting of the superscription</s>  he saw the lettertremble in the old mans hand and heard its crisp rustle as he clutchedit to keep it from falling to the ground</s>  he could not bear the sight ofthe longing and the fears that came into his face</s>  no hurry no hurryhe said kindly and turned away</s> iii</s> when pinney came back from the little turn he took northwick was stillholding the unopened letter in his hand</s>  he stood looking at it in akind of daze and he was pale and seemed faint</s> why mr</s>  northwick said pinney why dont you read your letter</s>  ifit hadnt been yours dont i know that youd have given it back to meat once</s> it isnt that said the man who was so much older and frailer thanpinney had expected to find him</s>  butare they well</s>  is itbad news</s> no</s>  pinney exulted</s>  theyre firstrate</s>  you neednt be afraid to readthe letter</s>  pinneys exultation came partly from his certainty that itwas really northwick and partly from the pleasure he felt in reassuringhim he sympathized with him as a father</s>  his pleasure was not marred bythe fact that he knew nothing of the state of northwicks family andbuilt his assertion upon the probability that the letter would containnothing to alarm or afflict him like a glass of water</s>  he suggestedseeing northwick sit inert and helpless on the steps of the innporchapparently without the force to break the seal of the letter</s>  or alittle brandy</s>  pinney handed him the neat leathercovered flask hiswife had reproached him for buying when they came away from home shesaid he could not afford it but he was glad he had got it now and heunscrewed the stopple with pride in handing it to northwick</s>  you looksick</s> i havent been very well northwick admitted and he touched thebottle with his lips</s>  it revived him and pinney now saw that if hewould leave him again he would open the letter</s>  there was little in itbut the tender assurance suzette gave him of their love and the anxietyof adeline and herself to know how and where he was</s>  she told him thathe was not to feel troubled about them that they were well and unhappyonly for him but he must not think they blamed him or had ever doneso</s>  as soon as they were sure they could reach him she said they wouldwrite to him again</s>  adeline wrote a few lines with her name to say thatfor some days past she had not been quite well but that she was betterand had nothing to wish for but to hear from him</s> when pinney came back a second time he found northwick with the letteropen in his hand</s> well sir he said with the easy respectfulness toward northwick thathad been replacing ever since he talked with matt hilary thehailfellow manner he used with most men and that had now fullyestablished itself youve got some noble scenery about here</s>  he meantto compliment northwick on the beauty of the landscape as peopleascribe merit to the inhabitants of a flourishing city</s> northwick by his silence neither accepted nor disclaimed the credit ofthe local picturesqueness and pinney ventured to add but you seem totake it out in nature mr</s>  northwick</s>  the place is pretty quiet sir</s> northwick paid no heed to this observation either but after sittingmute so long that pinney began to doubt whether he was ever going tospeak at all he began to ask some guarded and chary questions as to howpinney had happened to find him</s>  pinney had no unwillingness to telland now he gave him the letter of pre tienne with a eulogy of thepriests regard for northwicks interest and safety</s>  he told him howmarkhams talk had caught his attention and northwick tacitlyrecognized the speculator</s>  but when pinney explained that it was thepostmark on his letter to the events that gave him the notion of goingto rimouski he could see that northwick was curious to know the effectof that letter with the public</s>  at first he thought he would let himask but he perceived that this would be impossible for northwick andhe decided to say that letter was a great sensation mr</s>  northwick</s> the satisfaction that lighted up northwicks eyes caused pinney to addi guess it set a good many people thinking about you in a differentway</s>  it showed that there was something to be said on both sides and ibelieve it made friends for you sir</s>  yes sir</s>  pinney had neverbelieved this till the moment he spoke but then it seemed so probablehe had that he easily affirmed it</s>  i dont believe mr</s>  northwick hewent on but what this trouble could be patched up somehow so thatyou could come back if you wanted to give em time to think it over alittle</s> as soon as he said this the poison of that ulterior purpose which hiswife had forbidden him began to work in pinneys soul</s>  he could nothelp feeling what a grand thing it would be if he could go back withnorthwick in his train and deliver him over a captive of moralsuasion to his countrys courts</s>  whatever the result was whether theconviction or the acquittal of northwick the process would be themaking of pinney</s>  it would carry him to such a height in the esteem ofthose who knew him that he could choose either career and whether as areporter or a detective it would give his future the distinction of oneof the most brilliant pieces of work in both sorts</s>  pinney tried hisbest to counteract the influence of these ideas by remembering hispromises to his wife but it was difficult to recall his promises withaccuracy in his wifes absence and he probably owed his safety in thismatter more to northwicks temperament than to any virtue of his own</s> i think i understand how that would be said the defaulter coldly andhe began very cautiously to ask pinney the precise effect of his letteras pinney had gathered it from print and hearsay</s>  it was not in pinneysnature to give any but a rosecolored and illusory report of this buthe felt that northwick was sizing him up while he listened and knewjust when and how much he was lying</s>  this heightened pinneys respectfor him and apparently his divination of pinneys character had nothingto do with northwicks feeling toward him</s>  so far as pinney could makeout it was friendly enough and as their talk went on he imagined agrowing trustfulness in it</s>  northwick kept his inferences andconclusions to himself</s>  his natural reticence had been intensified bythe solitude of his exile it stopped him short of any expressionconcerning pinneys answers and pinney had to construct northwicksopinions from his questions</s>  his own cunning was restlessly at workexploring northwicks motives in each of these and it was not at faultin the belief it brought him that northwick clearly understood thesituation at home</s>  he knew that the sensation of his offence and flightwere past and that so far as any public impulse to punish him wasconcerned he might safely go back</s>  but he knew that the involuntarymachinery of the law must begin to operate upon him as soon as he camewithin its reach and he could not learn from pinney that anything hadbeen done to block its wheels</s>  the letter from his daughters threw nolight upon this point it was an appeal for some sign of life and lovefrom him nothing more</s>  they or the friends who were advising them hadnot thought it best to tell him more than that they were well andanxious to hear from him and pinney really knew nothing more aboutthem</s>  he had not been asked to hatboro to see them before he startedand with all the will he had to invent comfortable and attractivecircumstances for them he was at a disadvantage for want of material</s> the most that he could conjecture was that mr</s>  hilarys family had notbroken off their friendly relations with them</s>  he had heard old hilarycriticised for it and he told northwick so</s> i guess hes been standing by you mr</s>  northwick as far as heconsistently could he said and northwick ventured to reply that heexpected that</s>  it was young hilary who brought me the letter andtalked the whole thing up with me pinney added</s> northwick had apparently not expected this but he let no more than thefact appear</s>  he kept silent for a time then he said and you dontknow anything about the way theyre living</s> no i dont said pinney with final candor</s>  but i should say theywere living along there about as usual</s>  mr</s>  hilary didnt say but whatthey were</s>  i guess you havent got any cause to be uneasy on that score</s> my idea is mr</s>  northwick that they wanted to leave you just as free asthey could about themselves</s>  they wanted to find out your whereabouts inthe land of the living first of all</s>  you know that till that letter ofyours came out there were a good many that thought you were killed inthat accident at wellwater the day you left home</s> northwick started</s>  what accident</s>  what do you mean</s>  he demanded</s> why didnt you know about it</s>  didnt you see the accounts</s>  they had aname like yours amongst the missing and people who thought you were notin it said it was a little job you had put up</s>  there was a despatchengaging a pullman seat signed t</s>  w</s>  northwickah</s>  i knew it</s>  said northwick</s>  i knew that i must have signed my realname</s> well of course said pinney soothingly a man is apt to do thatwhen he first takes another</s>  its natural</s> i never heard of the accident</s>  i saw no papers for months</s>  i wouldntand then i was sickthey must have believed i was dead</s> well sir said pinney i dont know that that follows</s>  my wife andmyself talked that up a good deal at the time and we concluded that itwas about an even thing</s>  you see its pretty hard to believe that afriend is dead even when youve seen him die and i dont understandhow people that lose friends at a distance can ever quite realize thattheyre gone</s>  i guess that even if the ladies went upon the theory ofthe accident there was always a kind of a merciful uncertainty aboutit and that was my wifes notion too</s>  but thats neither here northere now mr</s>  northwick</s>  here you are alive and well in spite of alltheories to the contrarythough they must have been pretty wellexploded by your letter to the eventsand the question is what answerare you going to let me take back to your family</s>  you want to send someword dont you</s>  my instructions were not to urge you at all and iwont</s>  but if i was in your place i know what i should do</s> northwick did not ask him what it was he would do</s>  he fell into a deepsilence which it seemed to pinney he would never break and his facebecame such a blank that all pinneys subtlety was at fault</s>  it isdoubtful indeed if there was anything definite or directed in the mutemisery of northwicks soul</s>  it was not a sharp anguish such as a finersouls might have been but it was a real misery of a measure and aquality that he had not felt before</s>  now he realized how much he musthave made his children suffer</s>  perhaps it wrung him the more keenlybecause it seemed to be an expression of the divine displeasure whichhe flattered himself he had appeased and was a fatal consequence of hisguilt</s>  it was a terrible suggestion of the possibility that after allprovidence might not have been a party to the understanding betweenthem and that his goodwill toward those he had wronged had gone fornothing</s>  he had blamed himself for not having tried to retrieve himselfand make their losses good</s>  it was no small part of his misery now toperceive that anything he might have done would have gone for nothing inthis onesided understanding</s>  he fetched a long unconscious sigh</s> why its all over now mr</s>  northwick said pinney with a certainamusement at the simpleheartedness of this sigh whose cause he did notmisinterpret</s>  the question is now about your getting back to them</s> getting back</s>  you know i cant go back said northwick with bitterdespair and an openness that he had not shown before</s> far beneath and within the senses that apprehend the obvious thingspinney felt the unhappy man beginning to cling to him</s>  he returnedjoyously i dont know about that</s>  now see here mr</s>  northwick youbelieve that im here as your friend dont you</s>  that i want to deal ingood faith with you</s>  northwick hesitated and pinney pursued yourdaughters letter ought to be a guaranty of that</s> yes northwick admitted after another hesitation</s> well then what im going to say is in your interest and youve gotto believe that i have some authority for saying it</s>  i cant tell youjust how much for i dont know as i know myself exactly</s>  but i thinkyou can get back if you work it right</s>  of course you cant get back fornothing</s>  its going to cost you something</s>  its going to cost you allyouve brought with youpinney watched northwicks impassive face forthe next change that should pass upon it he caught it and addedandmore</s>  but i happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming whenits needed</s>  i cant say how i know it for i dont exactly know howi know it</s>  but i do know it and you know that its for you to takethe first step</s>  you must say how much money you brought with you andwhere it is and how it can be got at</s>  i should think said pinneywith a drop in his earnestness and as if the notion had just occurredto him you would want to see that place of yours again</s> northwick gave a gasp in the anguish of homesickness the words broughtupon him</s>  in a flash of what was like a luminous pang he saw it all asit looked the night he left it in the white landscape under the highbare wintry sky</s>  you dont know what youre talking about he saidwith a kind of severity</s> no pinney admitted i dont suppose any one can begin to appreciateit as you do</s>  but i was there just after you skippedthen i was the kind of man who would skip northwick swiftlyreflectedand i must say i would take almost any chance of getting back to aplace like that</s>  why he said with an easy caressing cordiality youcant have any idea how completely the things blown over</s>  why sirill bet you could go back to hatboro now and be there twentyfourhours before anybody would wake up enough to make trouble for you</s>  mindi dont say thats what we want you to do</s>  we couldnt make terms foryou half as well with you on the ground</s>  we want you to keep yourdistance for the present and let your friends work for you</s>  like

means dinner northwick gravely interpreted</s>  i will ask you tojoin me</s> oh thank you i shall be very glad said pinney rising with him</s>  theyhad been sitting on the steps of a structure that

years</s> i suppose you expect to light out if he comes pinney suggested inthe spirit of good fellowship towards northwick now thoroughlyestablished in him</s> he couldnt do me any harm if he wanted

and the priest</s>  he is a friend of fathertienne</s> oh i see said pinney</s>  he noticed that northwick walked slowly andweakly he ventured to put his hand under his elbow and northwick didnot

northwick briefly</s> iv</s> over the simple dinner which pinney praised for the delicacy of thelocal lamb and northwick ate of so sparingly northwick talked morefreely</s>  he told pinney all about his flight and his winter journey uptoward the northern verge of the civilized world</s>  the picturesquedetails of this narrative and their capability of distribution underattractive catchheads

time ever came when that story could be told it should beboth fortune and fame to him</s> they sat long over their dinner</s>  at last pinney pulled out his watch</s> what time did you say the boat for quebec got along here</s> northwick had not said of course but he now told pinney</s>  he knew thetime well in the homesickness which mounted to a paroxysm as that houreach day came and went</s>

best baby</s>  ive heard that child cry just once since it wasborn and that was when it first realized that it was in this vale oftears i believe we all do that but our baby finished up the wholecryingbusiness on that occasion</s> with pinney these statements led to others until he had possessednorthwick of his whole autobiography</s>  he was in high content withhimself and his joy overflowed in all manner of affectionate servicesto northwick which northwick accepted as the mourner entrusts hishelplessness to the ghastly kindness of the undertaker and finds in ita sort of human sympathy</s>  if northwick had been his own father pinneycould not have looked after him with tenderer care in putting histhings together for him and getting on board the boat and makinginterest with the clerk for the best stateroom</s>  he did not hesitate todescribe him as an american financier he enjoyed saying that he was incanada for his health and that he must have an extra room</s>  the clerkgave up the captains as all the others were taken and pinney occupiedit with northwick</s>  it was larger and pleasanter than the other roomsand after pinney got northwick to bed he sat beside him and talked</s> northwick said that he slept badly and liked to have pinney talkpinney could see that he was uneasy when he left the room and glad whenhe got back he made up his mind that northwick was somehow a very sickman</s>  he lay quite motionless in the lower berth where pinney made himcomfortable his hands were folded on his breast and his eyes wereclosed</s>  sometimes pinney as he talked on thought the man was dead andthere were times when he invented questions that northwick had to answeryes or no before he felt sure that he was still alive his breath wentand came so softly pinney could not hear it</s> pinney told him all about his courtship and married life and what aprize he had drawn in mrs</s>  pinney</s>  he said she had been the making ofhim and if he ever did amount to anything he should owe it to her</s> they had their eye on a little place out of town out wollaston way andpinney was going to try to get hold of it</s>  he was tired of being mewedup in a flat and he wanted the baby to get its feet on the ground whenit began to walk</s>  he wanted to make his rent pay part of his purchase</s> he considered that it was every mans duty to provide a permanent homefor his family as soon as he began to have a family and he askednorthwick if he did not think a permanent home was the thing</s> northwick said he thought it was and after he said that he sighed sodeeply that pinney said oh i beg your pardon</s>  he had in fact lostthe sense of northwicks situation and now he recurred to it with afresh impulse of compassion</s>  if his compassion was mixed with interestwith business as he would have said it was none the less a genuineemotion and pinney was sincere enough in saying he wished it could befixed so that northwick could get back to his home at his time of lifehe needed it</s> and i dont believe but what it could be fixed he said</s>  i dontknow much about the points of the case but i should say that with thefriends youve got you wouldnt have a great deal of trouble</s>  i presumethere are some legal forms you would have to go through with but thosethings can always be appealed and continued and nolle prossed and allthat till there isnt anything of them in the end</s>  of course it wouldhave been different if they could have got hold of you in the beginning</s> but now said pinney forgetting what he had already said of it thewhole thing has blown over so that that letter of yours from rimouskihardly started a ripple in boston i cant say how it was in hatboro</s> no sir i dont believe that if you went back now and your friendsstood by you as they ought toi dont believe youd get more than amere nominal sentence if you got that</s> northwick made no reply but pinney fancied that his words were havingweight with him

door and put the key under his pillow</s> northwick did not seem to notice him but a feeling of compunction madehim put the key back in the door</s>  i guess id better leave it thereafter all he said</s>  itll stop a key from the outside</s>  well sirgoodnight he added to northwick and climbed to his berth with alight heart</s>  toward morning he was wakened by a groaning from the lowerberth

waseasier</s>  but he held fast to pinneys hand which he had gripped in oneof his spasms and he did not loose it till pinney heard him drawing hisbreath in the long respirations of sleep</s>  then pinney got back to hisberth and fell heavily asleep</s> he knew it was late when he woke</s>  the boat was at rest and must belying at her landing in quebec</s>  he heard the passengers outside hurryingdown the cabin to go ashore</s>  when he had collected himself and recalledthe events of the night he was almost afraid to look down at northwicklest he should find him lying dead in his berth

room he might find himself</s>  there wasnothing there either it was as if he were a ghost come back in searchof the body it had left behind any one that met him he thought mightwell be more frightened than he and yet he did not lose the sense ofrisk to himself</s> he had an expectation born of long custom and persisting in spite ofthe nakedness of the place otherwise that he should see

conservatories and the dairies and the barnsshowed plain in the gray of the moonless starless night in thecoachmans quarters a little point of light appeared for a momentthrough the window and then vanished</s> northwick knew from this that the place was inhabited unless somehomeless tramp like himself was haunting it and it went through hisconfusion that he must speak to newton and caution him about trampssleeping in the barns anywhere they might set them on fire</s>  his mindreverted to his actual condition and he wondered how long he could comeand go as a vagrant without being detected</s>  if it were not for theaction against vagrants which he had urged upon the selectmen the summerbefore he might now come and go indefinitely</s>  but he was not to blameit was because mrs</s>  morrell had encouraged the tramps by her recklesscharity that something had to be done and now it was working againsthim</s>  it was hard he remembered reading of a man who had left his familyone day and taken a room across the street and lived there in sight ofthem unknown till he died and now he could not have passed his own doorwithout danger of arrest as a vagrant</s>  he struck another match andlooked at himself in the mirror framed as a window at one side of thebay he believed that with the long white beard he wore and his hairwhich he had let grow his own children would not have known him</s> it was bitter but his mind suddenly turned from the thought with alightness it had and he remembered that now he did not know where hischildren lived</s>  he must find out somehow he had come to see them andhe could not go back without</s>  he must hurry to find them and be goneagain before daylight</s>  he crept out to the stairs and struck a match tolight himself down

you</s>  what you doing in here id like to know</s>  who are youanyway you thief</s>  just hold that lantern up to his face a minutelectra</s> northwick had not tried to resist he had not struggled he had knownelbridge newtons voice at the first word</s>  he saw the figure of a womanbeside him stooping over the lantern and he knew that it was mrs</s> newton but he made no sort of appeal to either</s>  he did not make theleast sound or movement</s>  the habit of his whole life was reticenceespecially in emergencies and this habit had been strengthened anddeepened by the solitude in which he had passed the last halfyear</s>  if aknife had been put to his throat he would not have uttered a cry formercy but his silence was so involuntary that it seemed to him he didnot breathe while

beard</s> elbridges grip fell from him and let him stand free</s>  well ill bedumned said elbridge</s> his wife remained holding the lantern to northwicks face</s>  what are yougoing to do with him</s>  she asked at last as if northwick were notpresent he stood so dumb and impassive</s> i d know as i know said newton overpowered by the peculiarcomplications of the case</s>  he escaped from them for the moment in theprobable inference i presume he was lookin for his daughters</s>  didntyou know he turned to northwick with a sort of apologetic reproachlightin matches that way in the house

lantern</s>  i swear hes in hisstockin feet</s>  you look round and see if you can find his shoesanywhere lectra</s>  you got the light</s>  newton seemed to insist upon thisbecause it relieved him to delegate any step in this difficult matter toanother</s> his wife cast the light of her lantern about and found the shoes by thepiazzasteps and as northwick appeared no more able to move than tospeak elbridge stooped down and put on his shoes for him where hestood</s>  when he lifted himself he stared again at northwick as if tomake perfectly sure of him and then he said with a sigh of perplexityyou go ahead a little ways lectra with the lantern</s>  i presume wevegot to take him to em and his wife usually voluble and wilfulsilently obeyed</s> want to see your daughters</s>  he asked northwick and at the silencewhich was his only response newton said well i dont know as iblame him any for not wantin to commit himself</s>  you dont want to beafraid he added to northwick that

 bring him along elbridge</s> as northwick no more moved than spoke newton took him by the arm andhelped him down the piazzasteps and into the dark of the avenuetunnelled about their feet by the light of the lantern as they led andpushed their helpless capture toward the lodge at the avenue gate</s> northwick had heard and understood them he did not know what secretpurpose their pretence of taking

into some sort of unity</s> adeline did most of the talking</s>  she told her father how friends seemedto have been raised up for them in their need when it was greatest</s>  shepraised herself for the inspiration she had in going to putney foradvice because she remembered how her father had spoken of him thatlast night and for refusing to give up the property to the company</s>  shepraised putney for justifying and confirming her at every step and fordoing everything that could be done about the court</s>  she praised thehilarys all of them for their constancy to her father throughout

felt about him</s> he listened vaguely to it all</s>  a clock in the next room struck four andnorthwick started to his feet</s>  i must go</s> go</s>  adeline echoed</s> why must you go</s>  said suzette clinging about him</s> they were all silent in view of the necessity that stared them in theface</s> then adeline roused herself from the false dream of safety in which herwords had lulled

whatshall we do</s> i came over from east hatboro tonight said northwick</s>  i am goingback there to get the morning train</s>  this was the way he had plannedand he felt the strength of a fixed purpose in returning to his plan inwords</s> but its three miles</s>  adeline shrieked</s>  you can never get there inthe world in time for the train</s>  oh why didnt i tell elbridge to comefor you</s>  i must go and tell him to get ready right away</s> no ill go</s>  said suzette</s>  adeline</s> adeline flung the door open and started back with a cry from thedark vanlike vehicle before the door which looked like the blackmaria or an undertakers wagon in the pale light</s> its me said elbridges voice from the front of it and elbridgeshead dimly showed itself</s>  i got to thinkin maybe youd want thecarryall and i didnt know but what id better go and hitch upanyway</s> oh well we did</s>  cried adeline with an hysterical laugh</s>  herenow father get right in</s>  dont lose a

 if anybody tries to stop youid like to see anybody try to stop me said elbridge and he whippedup his horse</s>  then he leaned back toward northwick and said im goingto get the black colts time out of the old mare</s> which mare is it</s>  northwick asked</s> vii</s> on his way home from the station elbridge newton began to have someanxieties</s>  he had no longer occasion for any about northwick he wassafe on his way back to canada and elbridges anxieties were forhimself</s>  he was in the cold fit after his act of ardent generosity</s>  hehad no desire to entangle himself with the law by his act of incivism inhelping northwick to escape and he thought it might be well to puthimself on the safe side by seeing putney about it and locking thestable after the horse was stolen</s> he drove round by the lawyers house and stopped at his gate just asputney pushed his lawnmower up to it in his exercise of the instrumentbefore breakfast</s> elbridge leaned out of the carryall and asked in a low confidentialvoice if j</s>  milton northwick was to come back here on the sly sayto see his family and i was to help him git off again would i belible</s> why</s>  asked putney</s> because i just done it said elbridge desperately</s> just done it</s>  shouted putney</s>  why confound you</s>  he suddenly broughthis voice down</s>  do you mean to tell me the fellows been back

come now tell me all you know aboutit</s>  dont miss a thing</s>  after a few words from newton he broke outfound him in the house</s>  and i was down there prowling round the placemyself not three hours before</s>  go on</s>  great scott</s>  just think of it</s> putney was at one of those crises of his life when his drinkdevil wasbesetting him with sore temptation and for the last twentyfour hourshe had been fighting it with the ruses and pretences which he hadlearned to employ against it but he felt that he was losing the gamethough he was playing for much greater stakes than usual</s>  he had heldout so long since his last spree that if he lost now he would defeathopes that were singularly precious and sacred to him the hopes thatthose who loved him best and distrusted him most and forgave himsoonest had begun to cherish</s>  it would not break his wifes heart shewas used to his lapses but it would wring it more cruelly than usual ifhe gave way now</s> when the fiend thrust him out of his house the night before he knewthat she knew of it though she let him go in that fearful company andmade no effort to keep him</s>  he was so strait an agnostic that as heboasted he had no superstitions even but his relation to thenorthwicks covered the period of his longest resistance of temptationand by a sort of instinctive brute impulse he turned his step towardsthe place where they lived as if there might be rescue for him in themere vicinity of those women who had appealed to him in their distressas to a faithful enemy</s>  his professional pride his personal honor wereboth involved in the feeling that he must not fail them their implicitreliance had been a source of strength to him</s>  he was always hoping forsome turn of affairs which would enable him to serve them or rather toserve adeline for he cared little for suzette or only secondarily andsince pinney had gone upon his mission to canada he was daily lookingfor this chance to happen</s>  he must keep himself for that and notbecause of them alone but because those dearest to him had come tacitlyto connect his resistance of the tempter with his zeal for the interestsof his clients</s>  with no more reasoned motives than these he had walkedover the northwick place calling himself a fool for supposing that somevirtue should enter into him out of the ground there and yet finding asort of relief in the mere mechanical exercise the novelty ofexploring by night the property grown so familiar to him by day and sostrangely mixed up with the great trial and problem of his ownusefulness</s> he listened by turns with a sinking and a rising heart as newton nowdug the particulars of his adventure out of himself</s>  at the end heturned to go into the house</s> well what do you say squire putney</s>  elbridge called softly afterhim</s> say</s> you know about what i done</s> keep your mouth shut about what you done</s>  i should like to see yousent to jail though for what you didnt do</s> elbridge felt a consolatory quality in putneys resentment and putneyalready busy with the potentialities of the future was buoyed up by thestrong excitement of what had actually happened rather than finally

im so anxious about</s> she began to cry and at a look from suzette matt left them</s>  as hewalked along up toward the village in mechanical compliance withadelines crazy wish he felt more and more the deepening tragedy of thecase and the inadequacy of all compromises and palliatives</s>  thereseemed indeed but one remedy for the trouble and that was for northwickto surrender himself and for them all to meet the consequencestogether</s>  he realized how desperately homesick the man must have been totake the risks he had run in stealing back for a look upon the placesand the faces so dear to him his heart was heavy with pity for him</s>  onemight call him coward and egotist all one would at the end remained thefact of a love which if it could not endure heroically was still adeep and strong affection doubtless the deepest and strongest thing inthe mans weak and shallow nature</s>  it might be his truest inspirationand if it prompted him to venture everything and to abide by whatevermight befall him for the sake of being near those he loved andenjoying the convicts wretched privilege of looking on them now andthen who should gainsay him</s> matt took wade in on his way to putneys office to lay this questionbefore him and he answered it for him in the same breath certainly noone less deeply concerned than the mans own flesh and blood couldforbid him</s> im not sure said wade that even his own flesh and blood would havea supreme right there</s>  it may be that love and not duty is the highestthing in life</s>  oh i know how we reason it away and say that truelove is unselfish and can find its fruition in the very sacrifice of ourimpulses and we are fond of calling our impulses blind but god aloneknows whether they are blind</s>  the reasoned sacrifice may satisfy thehigher soul but what about the simple and primitive natures which itwont satisfy</s> for answer matt told how northwick had come back at the risk ofarrest for an hour with his children and was found in the empty housethat had been their home and brought to them how he had besought themto let him stay but they had driven him back to his exile</s>  mattexplained how he was on his way to the lawyer at adelines franticdemand to go all over the case again and see if something could not bedone to bring northwick safely home</s>  he had himself no hope of findingany loophole in the law through which the fugitive could come and goif he returned matt felt sure that he would be arrested and convictedbut he was not sure that this might not be the best thing for all</s>  youknow he said ive always believed that if he could voluntarilysubmit himself to the penalty of his offence the penalty would be thegreatest blessing for him on earth the only blessing for his ruinedlife</s> yes wade answered we have always thought alike about that andperhaps this torment of longing for his home and children may be thedivine means of leading him to accept the only mercy possible with godfor such a sufferer</s>  if there were no one but him concerned we couldnot hesitate in urging him to return</s>  but the innocent who must endurethe shame of his penalty with himthey are ready for that</s>  would it be worse than what they have learnedto endure</s> perhaps not</s>  but i was not thinking of his children alone</s>  youyourself matt your familymatt threw up his arms impatiently and made for the door</s>  theres noquestion of me</s>  and if they could not endure their portionthemere annoyance of knowing the slight for them in the minds of vulgarpeoplei should be ashamed of them</s> well you are right matt said his friend</s>  god bless you and guideyou</s>  added the priest</s> the lawyer had not yet come to his office and matt went to find him athis house</s>  putney had just finished his breakfast and they met at hisgate and he turned back indoors with matt</s>  well you know whatshappened i see he said after the first glance at matts face</s> yes i know and now what can be done</s>  are you sure weve consideredevery point</s>  isnt there some chanceputney shook his head and then bit off a piece of tobacco before hebegan to talk</s>  ive been over the whole case in my mind this morningand im perfectly certain there isnt the shadow of a chance of hisescaping trial if he gives himself up</s>
 thats what you mean i suppose</s> yes thats what i mean said matt with a certain disappointment</s>
 hesupposed he had nerved himself for the worst but he found he had beenwilling to accept something short of it</s> at times im almost sorry he got off said putney</s>  if we could havekept him and surrendered him to the law i believe we could have stavedoff the trial though we couldnt have prevented it and i believe wecould have kept him out of states prison on the ground of insanity</s> matt started impatiently</s>  oh i dont mean that it could be shown thathe was of unsound mind when he used the companys funds and tamperedwith their books though i have my own opinion about that</s>  but i feelsure that hes of unsound mind at present and i believe we could showit so clearly in court that the prosecution would find it impossible toconvict</s>  we could have him sent to the insane asylum and that would bea creditable exit from the affair in the public eye it would have aretroactive effect that would popularly acquit him of the chargesagainst him</s> putney could not forego a mischievous enjoyment of matts obviousdiscomfort at this suggestion</s>  his fierce eyes blazed but he addedseriously why shouldnt he have the advantage of the truth if that isthe truth about him</s>  and i believe it is</s>  i think it could be honestlyand satisfactorily proved from his history ever since the defalcationcame out that his reason is affected</s>  his whole conduct so far as iknow it shows it and i should like a chance to argue the case incourt</s>  and i feel pretty sure i shall yet</s>  im just as certain as i sithere that he will come back again</s>  he cant keep away and

write himself</s> adeline did not write suzette always said she was not quite well butwas getting better</s>  then in one of suzettes letters there came a tardyconfession that adeline was confined to her bed</s>  she was tormented withthe thought of having driven him away and suzette said she wished herto write and tell him to come back or to let them come to him</s>  sheasked him to express some wish in the matter so that she could show hisanswer to adeline</s>  suzette wrote that mr</s>  hilary had come over from hisfarm and was staying at elbridge newtons to be constantly near themand in

he replied tomatt with a letter decently observant of the peculiar circumstancesrecognizing the reluctance his father and mother might well feel andexpressing the hope that he was acting with their full and free consent</s> if this letter could have been produced in court it would have toldheavily against putneys theory of a defence on the ground of insanityit was so clear and just and

the place which inspite of his senses he could only imagine clothed in the comfort andstate that had been stripped from it</s>  elbridges talk on the way towest hatboro about the sale and what had become of the horses andcattle and the plants went for no more than the evidence of his owneyes that they were all gone</s>  he did not realize except in the shocksthat the fact imparted at times that

himself that if he went back he could contrive thatcompromise with the court which his friends had failed to bring abouthe persuaded himself that if it came to a trial he could offer evidencethat would result in his acquittal</s>  but if he must undergo somepunishment for the offence of being caught in transactions which wereall the time carried on with impunity he told himself that interestcould be used to make his punishment light</s>  in these hopeful moods itwas a necessity of his drama that his transgression of the law shouldseem venial to him</s>  it was only when he feared the worst that he feltguilty of wrong</s> it could not be said that these moments of a consciousness of guilt wereso frequent as ever to become confluent and to form a mood</s>  they cameand went perhaps toward the last they were more frequent</s>  what seemscertain is that in the end there began to mix with his longing for homea desire feeble and formless enough for expiation</s>  there began to besuggested to him from somewhere somehow something like the thoughtthat if he had really done wrong there might be rest and help inaccepting the legal penalty disproportionate and excessive as it

fell on the floor</s> xi</s> after they were married suzette and matt went to live on his farm andit was then that she accomplished a purpose she had never really givenup</s>  she surrendered the whole place at hatboro to the company herfather had defrauded</s>  she had no sentiment about the place such as hadmade the act impossible to adeline and must have prevented thesacrifice on suzettes part as long as her sister lived</s>  but sufferingfrom that and from all other earthly troubles was past for adeline shewas dead and suzette felt it no wrong to her memory to put out of herown hands the property which something higher than the logic of the caseforbade her to keep</s>  as far as her father was concerned she took hislast act as a sign that he wished to make atonement for the wrong he hadcommitted and she felt that the surrender of this property to hiscreditors was in the line of his endeavor</s>  she had strengthened herselfto bear his conviction and punishment if he came back and since he wasdead this surrender of possessions tainted for her with the dishonestyin which the unhappy man had lived was nothing like loss it was rathera joyful relief</s> yet it was a real sacrifice and she was destined to feel it in thenarrowed conditions of her life</s>  but she had become used to narrowconditions she had learned how little people could live with when theyhad apparently nothing to live for and now that in matt she hadeverything to live for the surrender of all she had in the world lefther incalculably rich</s> matt rejoiced with her in her decision though he had carefully kepthimself from influencing it</s>  he was poor too except for thecomfortable certainty that his father could not let him want but so faras he had been able he had renounced his expectations from his fathersestate in order that he might seem to be paying northwicks indebtednessto the company</s>  doubtless it was only an appearance in the end themoney his father left would come equally to himself and louise but inthe meantime the restitution for northwick did cramp eben hilary morefor the moment than he let his son know</s>  so he thought it well to allowmatt to go seriously to work on account of it and to test his economictheories in the attempt to make his farm yield him a living</s>  it must besaid that the prospect dismayed neither matt nor suzette there was thatin her life which enabled her to dispense with the world and itspleasures and favors and he had long ceased to desire them</s> the ponkwasset directors had no hesitation in accepting the assignmentof property made them by northwicks daughter</s>  as a corporate body theyhad nothing to do with the finer question of right involved</s>  they lookedat the plain fact that they had been heavily defrauded by the formerowner of the property who had inferably put it out of his hands in viewof some such contingency as he had finally reached and as it hadremained in the possession of his family ever since they took noaccount of the length of time that had elapsed since he was actually theowner</s>  they recognized the propriety of his daughters action insurrendering it and no member of the board was quixotic enough tosuggest that the company had no more claim upon the property sheconveyed to them than upon any other piece of real estate in thecommonwealth</s> they considered said putney who had completed the affair on the partof suzette and was afterwards talking it over with his crony dr</s> morrell in something of the bitterness of defeat that their firstduty was to care for
