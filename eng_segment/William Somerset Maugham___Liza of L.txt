vere street lambeth is a short straight street leading out of thewestminster bridge road it has forty houses on one side and fortyhouses on the other and these eighty houses are very much more likeone another than ever peas are like peas or young ladies like youngladies</s>  they are newish threestoried buildings of dingy grey brickwith slate roofs and they are perfectly flat without a bowwindow oreven a projecting cornice or windowsill to break the straightness ofthe line from one end of the street to the other</s> this saturday afternoon the street was full of life no traffic camedown vere street and the cemented space between the pavements wasgiven up to children</s>  several games of cricket were being played bywildly excited boys using coats for wickets an old tennisball or abundle of rags tied together for a ball and generally an oldbroomstick for bat</s>  the wicket was so large and the bat so small thatthe man in was always getting bowled when heated quarrels wouldarise the batter absolutely refusing to go out and the bowlerabsolutely insisting on going in</s>  the girls were more peaceable theywere chiefly employed in skipping and only abused one another mildlywhen the rope was not properly turned or the skipper did not jumpsufficiently high</s>  worst off of all were the very young children forthere had been no rain for weeks and the street was as dry and cleanas a covered court and in the lack of mud to wallow in they satabout the road disconsolate as poets</s>  the number of babies wasprodigious they sprawled about everywhere on the pavement round thedoors and about their mothers skirts</s>  the grownups were gatheredround the open doors there were usually two women squatting on thedoorstep and two or three more seated on either side on chairs theywere invariably nursing babies and most of them showed clear signsthat the present object of the maternal care would be soon ousted by anew arrival</s>  men were less numerous but such as there were leantagainst the walls smoking or sat on the sills of the groundfloorwindows</s>  it was the dead season in vere street as much as inbelgravia and really if it had not been for babies just come or justabout to come and an opportune murder in a neighbouring dosshousethere would have been nothing whatever to talk about</s>  as it was thelittle groups talked quietly discussing the atrocity or the merits ofthe local midwives comparing the circumstances of their variousconfinements</s> youll be avin your little trouble soon eh polly</s>  asked one goodlady of another</s> oh i reckon ive got another two months ter go yet answered polly</s> well said a third</s>  i wouldnt ave thought youd go so long by thelook of yer</s> i ope youll have it easier this time my dear said a very stoutold person a woman of great importance</s> she said she wasnt goin to ave no more when the last one come</s> this remark came from pollys husband</s> ah said the stout old lady who was in the business and

abaht right there ole gal said polly my word arry ifyou ave any more ill git a divorce that i will</s> at that moment an organgrinder turned the corner and came down thestreet</s> good biz eres an organ</s>  cried half a dozen people at once</s> the organman was an italian with a shock of black hair and aferocious moustache</s>  drawing his organ to a favourable spot hestopped released his shoulder from the leather straps by which hedragged it and cocking his large soft hat on the side of his headbegan turning the handle</s>  it was a lively tune and in less than notime a little crowd had gathered round to listen chiefly the youngmen and the maidens for the married ladies were never in a fit stateto dance and therefore disinclined to trouble themselves to standround the organ</s>  there was a moments hesitation at opening the ballthen one girl said to anothercome on florrie you and me aint shy well begin and bust it</s> the two girls took hold of one another one acting gentleman theother lady three or four more pairs of girls immediately joined themand they began a waltz</s>  they held themselves very upright and with anair of grave dignity which was quite impressive glided slowly aboutmaking their steps with the utmost precision bearing themselves withsufficient decorum for a court ball</s>  after a while the men began toitch for a turn and two of them taking hold of one another in themost approved fashion waltzed round the circle with the gravity ofjudges</s> all at once there was a cry theres liza</s>  and several members ofthe group turned and called out oo look at liza</s> the dancers stopped to see the sight and the organgrinder havingcome to the end of his tune ceased turning the handle and looked tosee what was the excitement</s> oo liza</s>  they called out</s>  look at liza oo i sy</s> it was a young girl of about eighteen with dark eyes and an enormousfringe puffedout and curled and frizzed covering her whole foreheadfrom side to side and coming down to meet her eyebrows</s>  she wasdressed in brilliant violet with great lappets of velvet and she hadon her head an enormous black hat covered with feathers</s> i sy aint she got up dossy</s>  called out the groups at the doors asshe passed</s> dressed ter death and kill the fashion thats wot i calls it</s> liza saw what a sensation she was creating she arched her back andlifted her head and walked down the street swaying her body fromside to side and swaggering along as though the whole place belongedto her</s> ave yer bought the street bill</s>  shouted one youth and then half adozen burst forth at once as if by inspirationknocked em in the old kent road</s> it was immediately taken up by a dozen more and they all yelled itoutknocked em in the old kent road</s>  yah ah knocked em in the oldkent road</s> oo liza</s>  they shouted the whole street joined in and they gavelong shrill earpiercing shrieks and strange calls that rung downthe street and echoed back again</s> hextra special</s>  called out a wag</s> oh liza</s>  oo</s>  ooo</s>  yells and whistles and then it thundered forthagainknocked em in the old kent road</s> liza put on the air of a conquering hero and sauntered on enchantedat the uproar</s>  she stuck out her elbows and jerked her head on oneside and said to herself as she passed through the bellowing crowdthis is jam</s> knocked em in the old kent road</s> when she came to the group round the barrelorgan one of the girlscried out to heris that yer new dress liza</s> well it dont look like my old one do it</s>  said liza</s> where did yer git it</s>  asked another friend rather enviously</s> picked it up in the street of course scornfully answered liza</s> i believe its the same one as i saw in the pawnbrokers dahn theroad said one of the men to tease her</s> thets it but wot was you doin in there</s>  pledgin yer shirt or wasit yer trousers</s> yah i wouldnt git a secondand dress at a pawnbrokers</s> garn</s>  said liza indignantly</s>  ill swipe yer over the snitch if yertalk ter me</s>  i got the mayterials in the west hend didnt i</s>  and iad it mide up by my court dressmiker so you jolly well dry up oldjellybelly</s> garn</s>  was the reply</s> liza had been so intent on her new dress and the comment it wasexciting that she had not noticed the organ</s> oo i say lets ave some dancin she said as soon as she saw it</s> come on sally she added to one of the girls you an mell dancetogither</s>  grind away old cock</s> the man turned on a new tune and the organ began to play theintermezzo from the cavalleria other couples quickly followedlizas example and they began to waltz round with the same solemnityas before but liza outdid them all if the others were as stately asqueens she was as stately as an empress the gravity and dignity withwhich she waltzed were something appalling you felt that the minuetwas a frolic in comparison it would have been a fitting measure totread round the grave of a premire danseuse or at the funeral of aprofessional humorist</s>  and the graces she put on the languor of theeyes the contemptuous curl of the lips the exquisite turn of thehand the dainty arching of the foot</s>  you felt there could be noquestioning her right to the tyranny of vere street</s> suddenly she stopped short and disengaged herself from her companion</s> oh i sy she said this is too bloomin slow it gives me thesick</s> that is not precisely what she said but it is impossible always togive the exact unexpurgated words of liza and the other personages ofthe story the reader is therefore entreated with his thoughts topiece out the necessary imperfections of the dialogue</s> its too bloomin slow she said again it gives me the sick</s>  letsave somethin a bit more lively than this ere waltz</s>  you stand overthere sally an well show em ow ter skirt dance</s> they all stopped waltzing</s> talk of the ballet at the canterbury and south london</s>  you just witetill you see the ballet at vere street lambethwell knock em</s> she went up to the organgrinder</s> na then italiano she said to him you buck up give us a tunethats got some guts in it</s>  see</s> she caught hold of his big hat and squashed it down over his eyes</s>  theman grinned from ear to ear and touching the little catch at theside began to play a lively tune such as liza had asked for</s> the men had fallen out but several girls had put themselves inposition in couples standing face to face and immediately the musicstruck up they began</s>  they held up their skirts on each side so asto show their feet and proceeded to go through the difficult stepsand motions of the dance</s>  liza was right they could not have done itbetter in a trained ballet</s>  but the best dancer of them all was lizashe threw her whole soul into it forgetting the stiff bearing whichshe had thought proper to the waltz and casting off its elaborategraces she gave herself up entirely to the present pleasure</s> gradually the other couples stood aside so that liza and sally wereleft alone</s>  they paced it carefully watching each others steps andas if by instinct performing corresponding movements so as to makethe whole a thing of symmetry</s> im abaht done said sally blowing and puffing</s>  ive ad enough ofit</s> go on liza</s>  cried out a dozen voices when sally stopped</s> she gave no sign of having heard them other than calmly to continueher dance</s>  she glided through the steps and swayed about andmanipulated her skirt all with the most charming grace imaginablethen the music altering she changed the style of her dancing herfeet moved more quickly and did not keep so strictly to the ground</s> she was getting excited at the admiration of the onlookers and herdance grew wilder and more daring</s>  she lifted her skirts higherbrought in new and more difficult movements into her improvisationkicking up her legs she did the wonderful twist backwards andforwards of which the dancer is proud</s> look at er legs</s>  cried one of the men</s> look at er stockins</s>  shouted another and indeed they wereremarkable for liza had chosen them of the same brilliant hue as herdress and was herself most proud of the harmony</s> her dance became gayer her feet scarcely touched the ground shewhirled round madly</s> take care yer dont split</s>  cried out one of the wags at a veryaudacious kick</s> the words were hardly out of his mouth when liza with a giganticeffort raised her foot and kicked off his hat</s>  the feat was greetedwith applause and she went on making turns and twists flourishingher skirts kicking higher and higher and finally among a volley ofshouts fell on her hands and turned head over heels in a magnificentcatharinewheel then scrambling to her feet again she tumbled intothe arms of a young man standing in the front of the ring</s> thats right liza he said</s>  give us a kiss now and promptlytried to take one</s> git aht</s>  said liza pushing him away not too gently</s> yus give us a kiss cried another running up to her</s> ill smack yer in the fice</s>  said liza elegantly as she dodged him</s> ketch old on er bill cried out a third an well all kissher</s> na you wont</s>  shrieked liza beginning to run</s> come on they cried well ketch er</s> she dodged in and out between their legs under their arms and thengetting clear of the little crowd caught up her skirts so that theymight not hinder her and took to her heels along the street</s>  a scoreof men set in chase whistling shouting yelling the people at thedoors looked up to see the fun and cried out to her as she dashedpast she ran like the wind</s>  suddenly a man from the side darted intothe middle of the road stood straight in her way and before she knewwhere she was she had jumped shrieking into his arms and he liftingher up to him had imprinted two sounding kisses on her cheeks</s> oh you </s>  she said</s>  her expression was quite unprintable nor canit be euphemized</s> there was a shout of laughter from the bystanders and the young menin chase of her and liza looking up saw a big bearded man whom shehad never seen before</s>  she blushed to the very roots of her hairquickly extricated herself from his arms and amid the jeers andlaughter of everyone slid into the door of the nearest house and waslost to view</s> 2liza and her mother were having supper</s>  mrs</s>  kemp was an elderly womanshort and rather stout with a red face and grey hair brushed tightback over her forehead</s>  she had been a widow for many years and sinceher husbands death had lived with liza in the groundfloor front roomin which they were now sitting</s>  her husband had been a soldier andfrom a grateful country she received a pension large enough to keepher from starvation and by charring and doing such odd jobs as shecould get she earned a little extra to supply herself with liquor</s> liza was able to make her own living by working at a factory</s> mrs</s>  kemp was rather sulky this evening</s> wot was yer doin this afternoon liza</s>  she asked</s> i was in the street</s> youre always in the

liza did not clear the supper things away as she was told but openedthe window and drew her chair to it</s>  she leant on the sill lookingout into the street</s>  the sun had set and it was twilight the sky wasgrowing dark bringing to view the twinkling stars there was nobreeze but it was pleasantly and restfully cool</s>  the good folk stillsat at their doorsteps talking as before on the same inexhaustiblesubjects but a little subdued with the approach of night</s>  the boyswere still playing cricket but they were mostly at the other end ofthe street and their shouts were muffled before they reached lizasears</s> she sat leaning her head on her hands breathing in the fresh air andfeeling a certain exquisite sense of peacefulness which she was notused to</s>  it was saturday evening and she thankfully remembered thatthere would be no factory on the morrow she was glad to rest</s> somehow she felt a little tired perhaps it was through the excitementof the afternoon and she enjoyed the quietness of the evening</s>  itseemed so tranquil and still the silence filled her with a strangedelight she felt as if she could sit there all through the nightlooking out into the cool dark street and up heavenwards at thestars</s>  she was very happy but yet at the same time experienced astrange new sensation of melancholy and she almost wished to cry</s> suddenly a dark form stepped in

and wite till the bloomin old thingstarts</s> she did not trouble to put on a hat but just walked out as she wasand accompanied sally to the publichouse which was getting up theexpedition</s> although there was still nearly half an hour to wait the brake wasdrawn up before the main entrance it was large and long with seatsarranged crosswise so that four people could sit on each and it wasdrawn by two powerful horses whose harness the coachman was nowexamining</s>  sally was not the first on the scene for already half adozen people had taken their places but harry had not yet arrived</s> the two girls stood by the publicdoor looking at the preparations</s> huge baskets full of food were brought out and stowed away cases ofbeer were hoisted up and put in every possible placeunder the seatsunder the drivers legs and even beneath the brake</s>  as more peoplecame up sally began to get excited about harrys nonappearance</s> i say i wish ed come</s>  she said</s>  e is lite</s> then she looked up and down the westminster bridge road to see if hewas in view</s> suppose e dont turn up</s>  i will give it im when e comes forkeepin me witin like this</s> why theres a quarter of an hour yet said liza who saw nothing atall to get excited about</s> at last sally saw her lover and rushed off to meet him</s>  liza was leftalone rather disconsolate at all this bustle and preparation</s>  she wasnot sorry that she had refused toms invitation but she did wish thatshe had conscientiously been able to accept it</s>  sally and her friendcame up attired in his sunday best he was a fit match for hisladylovehe wore a shirt and collar unusual luxuriesand becarried under his arm a concertina to make things merry on the way</s> aint you goin liza</s>  he asked in surprise at seeing her without ahat and with her apron on</s> na said sally aint she a soft</s>  tom said ed tike er an shewouldnt</s> well im dashed</s> then they climbed the ladder and took their seats so that liza wasleft alone again</s>  more people had come along and the brake was nearlyfull</s>  liza knew them all but they were too busy taking their placesto talk to her</s>  at last tom came</s>  he saw her standing there and wentup to her</s> wont yer change yer mind liza an come along with us</s> na tom i told yer i wouldntits not right like</s>  she felt shemust repeat that to herself often</s> i shant enjoy it a bit without you he said</s> well i cant elp it</s>  she answered somewhat sullenly</s> at that moment a man came out of the publichouse with a horn in hishand her heart gave a great jump for if there was anything sheadored it was to drive along to the tootling of a horn</s>  she reallyfelt it was very hard lines that she must stay at home when all thesepeople were going to have such a fine time and they were all somerry and she could picture to herself so well the delights of thedrive and the picnic</s>  she felt very much inclined to cry</s>  but shemustnt go and she wouldnt go she repeated that to herself twice asthe trumpeter gave a preliminary tootle</s> two more people hurried along and when they came near liza saw thatthey were jim blakeston and a woman whom she supposed to be his wife</s> are you comin liza</s>  jim said to her</s> no she answered</s>  i didnt know you was goin</s> i wish you was comin he replied we shall ave a game</s> she could only just keep back the sobs she so wished she were going</s> it did seem hard that she must remain behind and all because shewasnt going to marry tom</s>  after all she didnt see why that shouldprevent her there really was no need to refuse for that</s>  she began tothink she had acted foolishly it didnt do anyone any good that sherefused to go out with tom and no one thought it anything speciallyfine that she should renounce her pleasure</s>  sally merely thought her afool</s> tom was standing by her side silent and looking disappointed andrather unhappy</s>
it was too much</s>  she did want to go so badly and she really couldntresist any longer</s>  if tom would only ask her once more and if shecould only change her mind reasonably and decently she would acceptbut he stood silent and she had to speak herself</s>  it was veryundignified</s> yer know tom</s>  she said i dont want ter spoil your day</s> well i dont think i shall go alone it ud be so precious slow</s> supposing he didnt ask her again</s>  what should she do</s>  she looked upat the clock on the front of the pub and noticed that it only wantedfive minutes to the halfhour</s>  how terrible it would be if the brakestarted and he didnt ask her</s>  her heart beat violently against herchest and in her agitation she fumbled with the corner of her apron</s> well what can i do tom dear</s> why come with me of course</s>  oh</s>  liza do say yes</s> she had got the offer again and it only wanted a little seemlyhesitation and the thing was done</s> i should like ter tom she said</s>  but dyou think it ud bearright</s> yus of course it would</s>  come on liza</s>  in his eagerness he claspedher hand</s> well she remarked looking down if itd spoil your oliday</s> i wont go if you dontswop me bob i wont</s>  he answered</s>

fringe a twirl and atwistit was luckily still moderately in curl from the previoussaturdayand putting on her black hat with all the feathers sherushed along the street and scrambling up the brake steps fellpanting on toms lap</s> the coachman cracked his whip the trumpeter tootled his horn andwith a cry and a cheer from the occupants the brake clattered downthe road</s> 5as soon as liza had recovered herself she started examining the peopleon the brake and first of all she took stock of the woman whom jimblakeston had with him</s> this is my missus</s>  said jim pointing to her with his thumb</s> you aint been dahn in the street much ave yer</s>  said liza by wayof making the acquaintance</s> na answered mrs</s>  blakeston my youngsters been dahn with themeasles an ive ad my work cut

noticed her dress shewore a black cloak and a funny oldfashioned black bonnet thenexamining the woman herself she saw a middlesized stout personanywhere between thirty and forty years old</s>  she had a large fat facewith a big mouth and her hair was curiously done parted in themiddle and plastered down on each side of the head in little plaits</s> one could see that she was a woman of great strength notwithstandingevident traces of hard work and much childbearing</s> liza knew all the other passengers and now that everyone was settleddown and had got over the excitement of departure they had time togreet one another</s>  they were delighted to have liza among them forwhere she was there was no dullness</s>  her attention was first of alltaken up by a young coster who had arrayed himself in the traditionalcostumegrey suit tight trousers and shiny buttons in profusion</s> wot cheer bill</s>  she cried to him</s> wot cheer liza</s>  he answered</s> you are got up dossy youll

answered cruelly and drew his arm away from her waist</s> the horses scampered on and the man behind blew his horn with vigour</s> dont bust yerself guvnor</s>  said one of the passengers to him whenhe made a particularly discordant sound</s>  they drove along eastwardsand as the hour grew later the streets became more filled and thetraffic greater</s>  at last they got on the road to chingford and caughtup numbers of other vehicles going in the same directiondonkeyshaysponycarts tradesmens carts dogcarts drags brakes everyconceivable kind of wheel thing all filled with people thewretched donkey dragging along four solid ratepayers to the pairof stout horses easily managing a couple of score</s>  they exchangedcheers and greetings as they passed the red lion brake beingnoticeable above all for its uproariousness</s>  as the day wore onthe sun became hotter and the road seemed more dusty and threw up agreater heat</s> i am getting ot</s>  was the common cry and everyone began to puff andsweat</s> the ladies removed their cloaks and capes and the men followingtheir example took off their coats and sat in their shirtsleeves</s> whereupon ensued much banter of a not particularly edifying kindrespecting the garments which each person would like to removewhichshowed that the innuendo of french farce is not so unknown to theupright honest englishman as might be supposed</s> at last came in sight the halfway house where the horses were tohave a rest and a sponge down</s>  they had been talking of it for thelast quarter of a mile and when at length it was observed on the topof a hill a cheer broke out and some thirsty wag began to sing rulebritannia whilst others burst forth with a different national dittybeer glorious beer</s>  they drew up before the pub entrance and allclimbed down as quickly as they could</s>  the bar was besieged andpotmen and barmaids were quickly busy drawing beer and handing it overto the eager folk outside</s> the idyll of corydon and phyllis</s> gallantry ordered that the faithful swain and the amorous shepherdessshould drink out of one and the same pot</s> urry up an ave your whack said corydon politely handing thefoaming bowl for his fair one to drink from</s> phyllis without replying raised it to her lips and drank deep</s>  theswain watched anxiously</s> ere give us a chanst</s>  he said as the pot was raised higher andhigher and its contents appeared to be getting less and less</s> at this the amorous shepherdess stopped and handed the pot to herlover</s> well im dashed</s>  said corydon looking into it and added i guessyou know a thing or two</s>  then with courtly grace putting his own lipsto the place where had been those of his beloved finished the pint</s> go lumme</s>  remarked the shepherdess smacking her lips that wassomethin like</s>  and she put out her tongue and licked her lips andthen breathed deeply</s> the faithful swain having finished gave a long sigh and saidwell i could do with some more</s> for the matter of thet i could do with a gargle</s> thus encouraged the gallant returned to the bar and soon brought outa second pint</s> you ave fust pop amorously remarked phyllis and he took a longdrink and handed the pot to her</s> she with maiden modesty turned it so as to have a different part todrink from but he remarked as he saw heryou are bloomin particular</s> then unwilling to grieve him she turned it back again and appliedher ruby lips to the place where his had been</s> now we shant be long</s>  she remarked as she handed him back the pot</s> the faithful swain took out of his pocket a short clay pipe blewthrough it filled it and began to smoke while phyllis sighed at thethought of the cool liquid gliding down her throat and with thepleasing recollection gently stroked her stomach</s>  then corydon spatand immediately his love saidi can spit farther than thet</s> i bet yer yer cant</s> she tried and did</s>  he collected himself and spat again further thanbefore she followed him and in this idyllic contest they remainedtill the tootling horn warned them to take their places</s>           at last they reached chingford and here the horses were taken out andthe drag on which they were to lunch drawn up in a sheltered spot</s> they were all rather hungry but as it was not yet feedingtime theyscattered to have drinks meanwhile</s>  liza and tom with sally and heryoung man went off together to the nearest publichouse and as theydrank beer harry who was a great sportsman gave them a graphicaccount of a prizefight he had seen on the previous saturday eveningwhich had been rendered specially memorable by one man being so hurtthat he had died from the effects</s>  it had evidently been a very fineaffair and harry said that several swells from the west end had beenpresent and he related their ludicrous efforts to get in withoutbeing seen by anyone and their terror when someone to frighten themcalled out copper</s>  then tom and he entered into a discussion on thesubject of boxing in which tom being a shy and undogmatic sort ofperson was entirely worsted</s>  after this they strolled back to thebrake and found things being prepared for luncheon the hampers werebrought out and emptied and the bottles of beer in great profusionmade many a thirsty mouth thirstier</s> come along lidies an gentlemenif you are gentlemen shouted thecoachman the animals is now goin ter be fed</s> garn awy answered somebody were not hanimals we dont drinkwater</s> youre too clever remarked the coachman i can see youve justcome from the board school</s> as the former speaker was a lady of quite mature appearance theremark was not without its little irony</s>  the other man blew his hornby way of grace at which liza called out to himdont do thet youll bust i know you will an if you bust youllquite spoil my dinner</s> then they all set to</s>  porkpies saveloys sausages cold potatoeshardboiled eggs cold bacon veal ham crabs and shrimps cheesebutter cold suetpuddings and treacle gooseberrytartscherrytarts butter bread more sausages and yet again porkpies</s> they devoured the provisions like ravening beasts stolidly silentlyearnestly in large mouthfuls which they shoved down their throatsunmasticated</s>  the intelligent foreigner seeing them thus dispose oftheir food would have understood why england is a great nation</s>  hewould have understood why britons never never will be slaves</s>  theynever stopped except to drink and then at each gulp they emptiedtheir glass no heeltaps</s>  and still they ate and still theydrankbut as all things must cease they stopped at last and a longsigh of content broke from their twoandthirty throats</s> then the gathering broke up and the good folk paired themselves andseparated</s>  harry and his lady strolled off to secluded byways in theforest so that they might discourse of their loves and digest theirdinner</s>  tom had all the morning been waiting for this happy moment hehad counted on the expansive effect of a full stomach to thaw hislizas coldness and he had pictured himself sitting on the grass withhis back against the trunk of a spreading chestnuttree with his armround his lizas waist and her head resting affectionately on hismanly bosom</s>  liza too had foreseen the separation into couples afterdinner and had been racking her brains to find a means of getting outof it</s> i dont want im slobberin abaht me she said it gives me thesick all this kissin an cuddlin</s> she scarcely knew why she objected to his caresses but they bored herand made her cross</s>  but luckily the blessed institution of marriagecame to her rescue for jim and his wife naturally had no particulardesire to spend the afternoon together and liza seeing a littleembarrassment on their part proposed that they should go for a walktogether in the forest</s> jim agreed at once and with pleasure but tom was dreadfullydisappointed</s>  he hadnt the courage to say anything but he glared atblakeston</s>  jim smiled benignly at him and tom began to sulk</s>  thenthey began a funny walk through the woods</s>  jim tried to go on withliza and liza was not at all disinclined to this for she had come tothe conclusion that jim notwithstanding his cheek was not alf abad sort</s>  but tom kept walking alongside of them and as jim slightlyquickened his pace so as to get liza on in front tom quickened hisand mrs</s>  blakeston who didnt want to be left behind had to breakinto a little trot to keep up with them</s>  jim tried also to get lizaall to himself in the conversation and let tom see that he was out inthe cold but tom would break in with cross sulky remarks just tomake the others uncomfortable</s>  liza at last got rather vexed with him</s> strikes me you got aht of bed the wrong way this mornin she saidto him</s> yer didnt think thet when yer said youd come aht with me</s>  heemphasized the me</s> liza shrugged her shoulders</s> you give me the ump she said</s>  if yer wants ter mike a fool ofyerself you can go elsewhere an do it</s> i suppose yer want me ter go awy now he said angrily</s> i didnt say i did</s> arright liza i wont stay where im not wanted</s>  and turning onhis heel he marched off striking through the underwood into the midstof the forest</s> he felt extremely unhappy as he wandered on and there was a chokyfeeling in his throat as he thought of liza she was very unkind andungrateful and he wished he had never come to chingford</s>  she might soeasily have come for a walk with him instead of going with that beastof a blakeston she wouldnt ever do anything for him and he hatedherbut all the same he was a poor foolish thing in love and hebegan to feel that perhaps he had been a little exacting and a littleforward to take offence</s>  and then he wished he had never saidanything and he wanted so much to see her and make it up</s>  he made hisway back to chingford hoping she would not make him wait too long</s> liza was a little surprised when tom turned and left them</s> wot as e got the needle abaht</s>  she said</s> why es jealous answered jim with a laugh</s> tom jealous</s> yus es jealous of me</s> well e aint got no cause ter be jealous of anyonethat e aint</s> said liza and continued by telling him all about tom how he hadwanted to marry her and she wouldnt have him and how she had onlyagreed to come to chingford with him on the understanding that sheshould preserve her entire freedom</s>  jim listened sympathetically buthis wife paid no attention she was doubtless engaged in thoughtrespecting her household or her family</s> when they got back to chingford they saw tom standing in solitudelooking at them</s>  liza was struck by the woebegone expression on hisface she felt she had been cruel to him and leaving the blakestonswent up to him</s> i say tom she said dont tike on so i didnt mean it</s> he was bursting to apologize for his behaviour</s> yer know tom she went on im rather asty an im sorry i saidwot i did</s> oh liza you are good</s>  you aint cross with me</s> me</s>  na its you thet oughter be cross</s> you are a good sort liza</s> you

was a little afraid atfirst so tom walked by her side to take care of her she screamed themoment the beast began to trot and clutched hold of tom to saveherself from falling and as he felt her hand on his shoulder andheard her appealing cry oh do old me</s>  im fallin</s>  he felt thathe had never in his life been so deliciously happy</s>  the whole partyjoined in and it was proposed that they should have races but in thefirst heat when the donkeys broke into a canter liza fell off intotoms arms and the donkeys scampered on without her</s> i know wot ill do she said when the runaway had been recovered</s> ill ride im straddlewyse</s> garn</s>  said sally yer cant with petticoats</s> yus i can an i will too</s> so another donkey was procured this time with a mans saddle andputting her foot in the stirrup she cocked her leg over and took herseat triumphantly</s>  neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be reckonedamong lizas faults and in this position she felt quite at ease</s> ill git along arright now tom she said you garn andgit yerself a moke and come an jine in</s> the next race was perfectly uproarious</s>  liza kicked and beat herdonkey with all her might shrieking and laughing the white andfinally came in winner by a length</s>  after that they felt rather warmand dry and repaired to the publichouse to restore themselves andtalk over the excitements of the racecourse</s> when they had drunk several pints of beer liza and sally with theirrespective adorers and the blakestons walked round to find othermeans of amusing themselves they were arrested by a coconutshy</s> oh lets ave a shy</s>  said liza excitedly at which the unlucky menhad to pull out their coppers while sally and liza made ludicrouslybad shots at the coconuts</s> it looks so bloomin easy said liza brushing up her hair but icant it the blasted thing</s>  you ave a shot tom</s> he and harry were equally unskilful but jim got three coconutsrunning and the proprietors of the show began to look on him withsome concern</s> you are a dab at it said liza in admiration</s> they tried to induce mrs</s>  blakeston to try her luck but she stoutlyrefused</s> i dont old with such foolishness</s>  its wiste of money ter me shesaid</s> na then dont crack on old tart remarked her husband lets goan eat the coconuts</s> there was one for each couple and after the ladies had sucked thejuice they divided them and added their respective shares to theirdinners and teas</s>  supper came next</s>  again they fell to sausagerollsboiled eggs and saveloys and countless bottles of beer were added tothose already drunk</s> i dunno ow many bottles of beer ive drunkive lost count saidliza whereat there was a general laugh</s> they still had an hour before the brake was to start back and it wasthen the concertinas came in useful</s>  they sat down on the grass andthe concert was begun by harry who played a solo then there was acall for a song and jim stood up and sang that ancient ditty o demgolden kippers o</s>  there was no shyness in the company and lizaalmost without being asked gave another popular comic song</s>  thenthere was more concertina playing and another demand for a song</s>  lizaturned to tom who was sitting quietly by her side</s> give us a song old cock she said</s> i cant he answered</s>  im not a singin sort</s>  at which blakestongot up and offered to sing again</s> tom is rather a soft said liza to herself not like that coveblakeston</s> they repaired to the publichouse to have a few last drinks before thebrake started and when the horn blew to warn them rather unsteadilythey proceeded to take their places</s> liza as she scrambled up the steps said well i believe imboozed</s> the coachman had arrived at the melancholy stage of intoxication andwas sitting on his box holding his reins with his head bent on hischest</s>  he was thinking sadly of the longlost days of his youth andwishing he had been a better man</s> liza had no respect for such holy emotions and she brought down herfist on the crown of his hat and bashed it over his eyes</s> na then old jellybelly she said wots the good of avin a ficeas long as a kite</s> he turned round and smote her</s> jellybelly yerself</s>  said he</s> puddin fice</s>  she cried</s> kite fice</s> boss eye</s> she was tremendously excited laughing and singing keeping the wholecompany in an

resound with their noisy voices</s> liza and tom and the blakestons had got a seat together liza beingbetween the two men</s>  tom was perfectly happy and only wished thatthey might go on so for ever</s>  gradually as they drove along theybecame quieter their singing ceased and they talked in undertones</s> some of them slept sally and her young man were leaning up againstone another slumbering quite peacefully</s>  the night was beautiful thesky still blue very dark scattered over with countless brilliantstars and liza as she looked up at the heavens felt a certainemotion as if she wished to be taken in someones arms or feel somestrong mans caress and there was in her heart a strange sensation asthough it were growing big</s>  she stopped speaking and all four weresilent</s>  then slowly she felt toms arm steal round her waistcautiously as though it were afraid of being there this time bothshe and tom were happy</s>  but suddenly there was a movement on the otherside of her a hand was advanced along her leg and her hand wasgrasped and gently pressed</s>  it was jim blakeston</s>  she started a littleand began trembling so that tom noticed it and whisperedyoure cold liza</s> na im not tom its only a sort of shiver thet went through me</s> his arm gave her waist a squeeze and at the same time the big roughhand pressed her little one</s>  and so she sat between them till theyreached the red lion in the westminster bridge road and tom said tohimself i believe she does care for me after all</s> when they got down they all said good night and sally and liza withtheir respective slaves and the blakestons marched off homewards</s>  atthe corner of vere street harry said to tom and blakestoni say you blokes lets go an ave another drink before closintime</s>

lived came first and she left them thenwalking a few yards more they came to the blakestons and after alittle talk at the door liza bade the couple good night and was leftto walk the rest of the way home</s>  the street was perfectly silent andthe lampposts far apart threw a dim light which only served to makelisa realize her solitude</s>  there was such a difference between thestreet at midday with its swarms of people and now when there wasneither sound nor soul besides herself that even she was struck byit</s>  the regular line of houses on either side with the even pavementsand straight cemented road seemed to her like some desert place asif everyone were dead or a fire had raged and left it all desolate</s> suddenly she heard a footstep she started and looked back</s>  it was aman hurrying behind her and in a moment she had recognized jim</s>
she stopped till he had come up to her</s> wot ave yer come aht again for</s>  she said</s> ive come aht ter say good night to you liza he answered</s> but yer said good night a moment ago</s> i wanted to say it againproperly</s> wheres yer missus</s> oh shes gone in</s>  i said i was dry and was goin ter ave a drinkafter all</s> but shell know yer didnt go ter the pub</s> na she wont shes gone straight upstairs to see after the kid</s>  iwanted ter see yer alone liza</s> why</s> he didnt answer but tried to take hold of her hand</s>  she drew it awayquickly</s>  they walked in silence till they came to lizas house</s> good night said liza</s> wont you come for a little walk liza</s> tike care no one ears you she added in a whisper though why shewhispered she did not know</s> will yer</s>  he asked again</s> nayouve got to get up at five</s> oh i only said thet not ter go inter the pub with them</s> so as yer might come ere with me</s>  asked liza</s> yus</s> no im not comin</s>  good night</s> well say good night nicely</s>

back to work without a headacheand except for a slight languor feeling no worse for the previousdays debauch</s>  as she worked on she began going over in her mind theevents of the preceding day and she found entwined in all herthoughts the burly person of jim blakeston</s>  she saw him walking by herside in the forest presiding over the meals playing the concertinasinging joking and finally on the drive back she felt the heavyform by her side and the big rough hand holding hers while tomsarm was round her waist</s>  tom</s>  that was the first time he had enteredher mind and he sank into a shadow beside the other</s>  last of all sheremembered the walk home from the pub the good nights and the rapidfootsteps as jim caught her up and the kiss</s>  she blushed and lookedup quickly to see

listenedagain and in a moment the sound was repeated three or four gentletaps on the window</s>  she opened it quickly and whisperedjim</s> thets me he answered come aht</s> closing the window she went into the passage and opened the streetdoor it was hardly unlocked before jim had pushed his way in partlyshutting it behind him he took her in his arms and hugged her to hisbreast</s>  she kissed

passed him turned round and looked at her wonderingwhether she was meditating some illegal deed</s>  she breathed freely oncoming into the open road and seeing jim skulking behind a tree ranup to him and in the shadows they kissed again</s> 9thus began a time of love and joy</s>  as soon as her work was over andshe had finished tea liza would slip out and at some appointed spotmeet jim</s>  usually it would be at the church where the westminsterbridge road bends down to get to the river and they would go offarminarm till they came to some place where they could sit down andrest</s>  sometimes they would walk along the albert embankment tobattersea park and here sit on the benches watching the childrenplay</s>  the female cyclist had almost abandoned battersea for the parkson the other side of the river but often enough one went by andliza with the oldfashioned prejudice of her class would look afterthe rider and make some remark about her not seldom more forciblethan ladylike</s>  both jim and she liked children and tiny raggedurchins would gather round to have rides on the mans knees or mockfights with liza</s> they thought themselves far away from anyone in vere street buttwice as they were walking along they were met by people they knew</s> once it was two workmen coming home from a job at vauxhall liza didnot see them till they were quite near she

a whisper when they had gone by</s> i wonder if they see us</s>  almost instinctively she turned round andat the same moment one of the men turned too then there was no doubtabout it</s> thet did give

jim afterwards met one of the men in apublichouse he did not mention a meeting and they thought thatperhaps they had not been recognized</s>  but the second time was worse</s> it was on the albert embankment again</s>  they were met by a party offour all of whom lived in the street</s>  lizas heart sank within herfor there was no chance of escape she thought of turning quickly andwalking in the

laughing</s> after that they decided to go where there was no chance at all oftheir being seen</s>  they did not meet till they got over westminsterbridge and thence they made their way into the park they would liedown on the grass in one anothers arms and thus spend the longsummer evenings</s>  after the heat of the day there would be a gentlebreeze in the park and they would take in long breaths of the air itseemed far away from london it was so quiet and cool and liza asshe lay by jims side felt her love for him overflowing to the restof the world and enveloping mankind itself in a kind of gratefulhappiness</s>  if it could only have lasted</s>  they would stay and see thestars shine out dimly one by one from the blue sky till it grewlate and the blue darkened into black and the stars glittered inthousands all above them</s>  but as the nights grew cooler they found itcold on the grass and the time they had there seemed too short forthe long journey they had to make so crossing the bridge as beforethey strolled along the embankment till they came to a vacant benchand there they would sit with liza nestling close up to her lover andhis great arms around her</s>  the rain of september made no difference tothem they went as usual to their seat beneath the trees and jimwould take liza on his knee and opening his coat shelter her withit while she with her arms round his neck pressed very close tohim and occasionally gave a little laugh of pleasure and delight</s> they hardly spoke at all through these evenings for what had they tosay to one another</s>  often without exchanging a word they would sit foran hour with their faces touching the one feeling on his cheek thehot breath from the others mouth while at the end of the time theonly motion was an upraising of lizas lips a bending down of jimsso that they might meet and kiss</s>  sometimes liza fell into a lightdoze and jim would sit very still for fear of waking her and whenshe roused herself she would smile while he bent down again andkissed her</s>  they were very happy</s>  but the hours passed by so quicklythat big ben striking twelve came upon them as a surprise andunwillingly they got up and made their way homewards their partingswere never endingeach evening jim refused to let her go from hisarms and tears stood in his eyes at the thought of the separation</s> id give somethin he would say if we could be togither always</s> never mind old chap</s>  liza would answer herself half crying itcant be elped so we must jolly well lump it</s> but notwithstanding all their precautions people in vere streetappeared to know</s>  first of all liza noticed that the women did notseem quite so cordial as before and she often fancied they weretalking of her when she passed by they appeared to look at her thensay something or other and perhaps burst out laughing but when sheapproached they would immediately stop speaking and keep silence in arather awkward constrained manner</s>  for a long time she was unwillingto believe that there was any change in them and jim who had observednothing persuaded her that it was all fancy</s>  but gradually it becameclearer and jim had to agree with her that somehow or other peoplehad found out</s>  once when liza had been talking to polly jimsdaughter mrs</s>  blakeston had called her and when the girl had come toher mother liza saw that she spoke angrily and they both lookedacross at her</s>  when liza caught mrs</s>  blakestons eye she saw in herface a surly scowl which almost frightened her she wanted to braveit out and stepped forward a
