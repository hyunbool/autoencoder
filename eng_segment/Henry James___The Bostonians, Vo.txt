suburban residence in monadnoc place</s>  he had induced ajuvenile maidservant by an appeal somewhat impassioned to let theladies know that he was there and she had returned after a longabsence to say that miss tarrant would come down to him in a littlewhile</s>  he possessed himself according to his wont of the nearest bookit lay on the table with an old magazine and a little japanned traycontaining tarrants professional cardshis denomination as a mesmerichealer and spent ten minutes in turning it over</s>  it was a biography ofmrs</s>  ada t</s>  p</s>  foat the celebrated trancelecturer and was embellishedby a portrait representing the lady with a surprised expression andinnumerable ringlets</s>  ransom said to himself after reading a few pagesthat much ridicule had been cast upon southern literature but if thatwas a fair specimen of northern</s> and he threw it back upon the tablewith a gesture almost as contemptuous as if he had not known perfectlyafter so long a residence in the north that it was not while hewondered whether this was the sort of thing miss tarrant had beenbrought up on</s>  there was no other book to be seen and he remembered tohave read the magazine so there was finally nothing for him as theoccupants of the house failed still to appear but to stare before himinto the bright bare common little room which was so hot that hewished to open a window and of which an ugly undraped crosslightseemed to have taken upon itself to reveal the poverty</s>  ransom as ihave mentioned had not a high standard of comfort and noticed littleusually how peoples houses were furnishedit was only when they werevery pretty that he observed but what he saw while he waited at doctortarrants made him say to himself that it was no wonder verena likedbetter to live with olive chancellor</s>  he even began to wonder whether itwere for the sake of that superior softness she had cultivated misschancellors favour and whether mrs</s>  luna had been right about herbeing mercenary and insincere</s>  so many minutes elapsed before sheappeared that he had time to remember he really knew nothing to thecontrary as well as to consider the oddity so great when one didconsider it of his coming out to cambridge to see her when he had onlya few hours in boston to spare a year and a half after she had givenhim her very casual invitation</s>  she had not refused to receive him atany rate she was free to if it didnt please her</s>  and not only thisbut she was apparently making herself fine in his honour inasmuch as heheard a rapid footstep move to and fro above his head and even throughthe slightness which in monadnoc place did service for an upper floorthe sound of drawers and presses opened and closed</s>  some one was flyinground as they said in mississippi</s>  at last the stairs creaked under alight tread and the next moment a brilliant person came into the room</s> his reminiscence of her had been very pretty but now that she haddeveloped and matured the little prophetess was prettier still</s>  hersplendid hair seemed to shine her cheek and chin had a curve whichstruck him by its fineness her eyes and lips were full of smiles andgreetings</s>  she had appeared to him before as a creature of brightnessbut now she lighted up the place she irradiated she made everythingthat surrounded her of no consequence dropping upon the shabby sofawith an effect as charming as if she had been a nymph sinking on aleopardskin and with the native sweetness of her voice forcing him tolisten till she spoke again</s>  it was not long before he perceived thatthis added lustre was simply success she was young and tender stillbut the sound of a great applauding audience had been in her ears itformed an element in which she felt buoyant and floated</s>  stillhowever her glance was as pure as it was direct and that fantasticfairness hung about her which had made an impression on him of oldand which reminded him of unworldly placeshe didnt knowwhereconventcloisters or vales of arcady</s>  at that other time she hadbeen particoloured and bedizened and she had always an air of costumeonly now her costume was richer and more chastened</s>  it was her line hercondition part of her expression</s>  if at miss birdseyes and afterwardsin charles street she might have been a ropedancer today she made ascene of the mean little room in monadnoc place such a scene as aprima donna makes of daubed canvas and dusty boards</s>  she addressed basilransom as if she had seen him the other week and his merits were freshto her though she let him while she sat smiling at him explain in hisown rather ceremonious way why it was he had presumed to call upon heron so slight an acquaintanceon an invitation which she herself had hadmore than time to forget</s>  his explanation as a finished andsatisfactory thing quite broke down there was no more impressivereason than that he had simply wished to see her</s>  he became aware thatthis motive loomed large and that her listening smile innocent as itwas in the arcadian manner of mockery seemed to accuse him of nothaving the courage of his inclination</s>  he had alluded especially totheir meeting at miss chancellors there it was that she had told himshe should be glad to see him in her home</s> oh yes i remember perfectly and i remember quite as well seeing youat miss birdseyes the night before</s>  i made a speechdont youremember</s>  that was delightful</s> it was delightful indeed said basil ransom</s>

 i must add that we did see somenoble specimens over there</s>  in england we met some lovely women highlycultivated and of immense organising power</s>  in france we saw somewonderful contagious types we passed a delightful evening with thecelebrated marie verneuil she was released from prison you know onlya few weeks before</s>  our total impression was that it is only a questionof timethe future is ours</s>  but everywhere we heard one cryhow longo lord how long</s> basil ransom listened to this considerable statement with a feelingwhich as the current of miss tarrants facile utterance flowed on tookthe form of an hilarity charmed into stillness by the fear of losingsomething</s>  there was indeed a sweet comicality in seeing this prettygirl sit there and in answer to a casual civil inquiry drop intooratory as a natural thing</s>  had she forgotten where she was and did shetake him for a full house</s>  she had the same turns and cadences almostthe same gestures as if she had been on the platform and the greatqueerness of it was that with such a manner she should escape beingodious</s>  she was not odious she was delightful she was not dogmaticshe was genial</s>  no wonder she was a success if she speechified as abird sings</s>  ransom could see too from her easy lapse how thelecturetone was the thing in the world with which by education byassociation she was most familiar</s>  he didnt know what to make of hershe was an astounding young phenomenon</s>  the other time came back to himafresh and how she had stood up at miss birdseyes it occurred to himthat an element here had been wanting</s>  several moments after she hadceased speaking he became conscious that the expression of his facepresented a perceptible analogy to a broad grin</s>  he changed his posturesaying the first thing that came into his head</s>  i presume you dowithout your father now</s> without my father</s> to set you going as he did that time i heard you</s> oh i see you thought i had begun a lecture</s>  and she laughed inperfect good humour</s>  they tell me i speak as i talk so i suppose italk as i speak</s>  but you mustnt put me on what i saw and heard ineurope</s>
 yes i dont depend on father any more she went on whileransoms sense of having said too sarcastic a thing was deepened by herperfect indifference to it</s>  he finds his patients draw off aboutenough any way</s>  but i owe him everything if it hadnt been for him noone would ever have known i had a giftnot even myself</s>  he started meso once for all that i now go alone</s> you go beautifully said ransom wanting to say something agreeableand even respectfully tender to her but troubled by the fact thatthere was nothing he could say that didnt sound rather like chaff</s> there was no resentment in her however for in a moment she said tohim as quickly as it occurred to her in the manner of a personrepairing an accidental omission it was very good of you to come sofar</s> this was a sort of speech it was never safe to make to ransom there wasno telling what retribution it might entail</s>  do you suppose any journeyis too great too wearisome when its a question of so great apleasure</s>  on this occasion it was not worse than that</s> well people have come from other cities verena answered not withpretended humility but with pretended pride</s>  do you know cambridge</s> this is the first time i have ever been here</s> well i suppose you have heard of the university its so celebrated</s> yeseven in mississippi</s>  i suppose its very fine</s> i presume it is said verena but you cant expect me to speak withmuch admiration of an institution of which the doors are closed to oursex</s> do you then advocate a system of education in common</s> i advocate equal rights equal opportunities equal privileges</s>  so doesmiss chancellor verena added with just a perceptible air of feelingthat her declaration needed support</s> oh i thought what she wanted was simply a different inequalitysimplyto turn out the men altogether ransom said</s> well she thinks we have great arrears to make up</s>  i do tell hersometimes that what she desires is not only justice but vengeance</s>  ithink she admits that verena continued with a certain solemnity</s>  thesubject however held her but an instant and before ransom had time tomake any comment she went on in a different tone you dont mean tosay you live in mississippi now</s>  miss chancellor told me when you werein boston before that you had located in new york</s>  she persevered inthis reference to himself for when he had assented to her remark aboutnew york she asked him whether he had quite given up the south</s> given it upthe poor dear desolate old south</s>  heaven forbid</s>  basilransom exclaimed</s> she looked at him for a moment with an added softness</s>  i presume it isnatural you should love your home</s>  but i am afraid you think i dontlove mine much i have been herefor so longso little</s>  misschancellor has absorbed methere is no doubt about that</s>  but its apity i wasnt with her today</s>  ransom made no answer to this he wasincapable of telling miss tarrant that if she had been he would not havecalled upon her</s>  it was not indeed that he was not incapable ofhypocrisy for when she had asked him if he had seen his cousin thenight before and he had replied that he hadnt seen her at all and shehad exclaimed with a candour which the next minute made her blush ahyou dont mean to say you havent forgiven her</s> after this he put on alook of innocence sufficient to carry off the inquiry forgiven her forwhat</s> verena coloured at the sound of her own words</s>  well i could see howmuch she felt that time at her house</s> what did she feel</s>  basil ransom asked with the natural provokingnessof a man</s> i know not whether verena was provoked but she answered with morespirit than sequence well you know you did pour contempt on usever so much i could see how it worked olive up</s>  are you not going tosee her at all</s> well i shall think about that i am here only for three or four dayssaid ransom smiling as men smile when they are perfectlyunsatisfactory</s> it is very possible that verena was provoked inaccessible as she wasin a general way to irritation for she rejoined in a moment with alittle deliberate air well perhaps its as well you shouldnt go ifyou havent changed at all</s> i havent changed at all said the young man smiling still with hiselbows on the arms of his chair his shoulders pushed up a little andhis thin brown hands interlocked in front of him</s> well i have had visitors who were quite opposed</s>  verena announced asif such news could not possibly alarm her</s>  then she added how then didyou know i was out here</s> miss birdseye told me</s> oh i am so glad you went to see her</s>  the girl cried speaking againwith the impetuosity of a moment before</s> i didnt go to see her</s>  i met her in the street just as she wasleaving miss chancellors door</s>  i spoke to her and accompanied her somedistance</s>  i passed that way because i knew it was the direct way tocambridgefrom the commonand i was coming out to see you any wayonthe chance</s> on the chance</s>  verena repeated</s> yes mrs</s>  luna in new york told me you were sometimes here and iwanted at any rate to make the attempt to find you</s> it may be communicated to the reader that it was very agreeable toverena to learn that her visitor had made this arduous pilgrimage forshe knew well enough how people in boston regarded a winter journey tothe academic suburb with only half the prospect of a reward but herpleasure was mixed with other feelings or at least with theconsciousness that the whole situation was rather less simple than theelements of her life had been hitherto</s>  there was the germ of disorderin this invidious distinction which mr</s>  ransom had suddenly made betweenolive chancellor who was related to him by blood and herself who hadnever been related to him in any way whatever</s>  she knew olive by thistime well enough to wish not to reveal it to her and yet it would besomething quite new for her to undertake to conceal such an incident asher having spent an hour with mr</s>  ransom during a flying visit he hadmade to boston</s>  she had spent hours with other gentlemen whom olivedidnt see but that was different because her friend knew about herdoing it and didnt care in regard to the personsdidnt care thatis as she would care in this case</s>  it was vivid to verenas mind thatnow olive would care</s>
 she had talked about mr</s>  burrage and mr</s> pardon and even about some gentlemen in europe and she had not afterthe first few days a year and a half before talked about mr</s>
 ransom</s> nevertheless there were reasons clear to verenas view for wishingeither that he would go and see olive or would keep away from her andthe responsibility of treating the fact that he had not so kept away asa secret seemed the greater perhaps in the light of this other factthat so far as simply seeing mr</s>  ransom wentwhy she quite liked it</s> she had remembered him perfectly after their two former meetingssuperficial as their contact then had been she had thought of him atmoments and wondered whether she should like him if she were to know himbetter</s>  now at the end of twenty minutes she did know him better andfound that he had rather a curious but still a pleasant way</s>  there hewas at any rate and she didnt wish his call to be spoiled by anyuncomfortable implication of consequences</s>
 so she glanced off at thetouch of mrs</s>  lunas name it seemed to afford relief</s>  oh yes mrs</s>
lunaisnt she fascinating</s> ransom hesitated a little</s>  well no i dont think she is</s> you ought to like hershe hates our movement</s>  and verena askedfurther numerous questions about the brilliant adeline whether he sawher often whether she went out much whether she was admired in newyork whether he thought her very handsome</s>  he answered to the best ofhis ability but soon made the reflexion that he had not come out tomonadnoc place to talk about mrs</s>  luna in consequence of which tochange the subject as well as to acquit himself of a social duty hebegan to speak of verenas parents to express regret that mrs</s>  tarranthad been sick and fear that he was not to have the pleasure of seeingher</s>  she is a great deal better verena said but shes lying downshe lies down a great deal when she has got nothing else to do</s>  mothersvery peculiar she added in a moment she lies down when she feelswell and happy and when shes sick she walks aboutshe roams all roundthe house</s>  if you hear her on the stairs a good deal you can be prettysure shes very bad</s>  shell be very much interested to hear about youafter you have left</s> ransom glanced at his watch</s>  i hope i am not staying too longthat iam not taking you away from her</s> oh no she likes visitors even when she cant see them</s>  if it didnttake her so long to rise she would have been down here by this time</s>  isuppose you think she has missed me since i have been so absorbed</s> well so she has but she knows its for my good</s>  she would make anysacrifice for affection</s> the fancy suddenly struck ransom of asking in response to this andyou</s>  would you make any</s> verena gave him a bright natural stare</s>  any sacrifice for affection</s> she thought a moment and then she said i dont think i have a rightto say because i have never been asked</s>  i dont remember ever to havehad to make a sacrificenot an important one</s> lord</s>  you must have had a happy life</s> i have been very fortunate i know that</s>  i dont know what to do when ithink how some womenhow most womensuffer</s>  but i must not speak ofthat she went on with her smile coming back to her</s>  if you opposeour movement you wont want to hear of the suffering of women</s> the suffering of women is the suffering of all humanity ransomreturned</s>  do you think any movement is going to stop thator all thelectures from now to doomsday</s>  we are born to sufferand to bear itlike decent people</s> oh i adore heroism</s>  verena interposed</s> and as for women ransom went on they have one source of happinessthat is closed to usthe consciousness that their presence here belowlifts half the load of our suffering</s> verena thought this very graceful but she was not sure it was notrather sophistical she would have liked to have olives judgement uponit</s>  as that was not possible for the present she abandoned the questionsince learning that mr</s>  ransom had passed over olive to come to hershe had become rather fidgety and inquired of the young manirrelevantly whether he knew any one else in cambridge</s> not a creature as i tell you i have never been here before</s>  yourimage alone attracted me this charming interview will be henceforth myonly association with the place</s> its a pity you couldnt have a few more said verena musingly</s> a few more interviews</s>  i should be unspeakably delighted</s> a few more associations</s>  did you see the colleges as you came</s> i had a glimpse of a large enclosure with some big buildings</s>  perhapsi can look at them better as i go back to boston</s> oh yes you ought to see themthey have improved so much of late</s>  theinner life of course is the greatest interest but there is some finearchitecture if you are not familiar with europe</s>  she paused a momentlooking at him with an eye that seemed to brighten and continuedquickly like a person who had collected herself for a little jump ifyou would like to walk round a little i shall be very glad to showyou</s> to walk roundwith you to show me</s>  ransom repeated</s>  my dear misstarrant it would be the greatest privilegethe greatest happinessofmy life</s>  what a delightful ideawhat an ideal guide</s> verena got up she would go and put on her hat he must wait a little</s> her offer had a frankness and friendliness which gave him a newsensation and he could not know that as soon as she had made it thoughshe had hesitated too with a moment of intense reflexion she seemedto herself strangely reckless</s>  an impulse pushed her she obeyed it withher eyes open</s>  she felt as a girl feels when she commits her firstconscious indiscretion</s>  she had done many things before which manypeople would have called indiscreet but that quality had not evenfaintly belonged to them in her own mind she had done them in perfectgood faith and with a remarkable absence of palpitation</s>  thissuperficially ingenuous proposal to walk around the colleges with mr</s> ransom had really another colour it deepened the ambiguity of herposition by reason of a prevision which i shall presently mention</s>  ifolive was not to know that she had seen him this extension of theirinterview would double her secret</s>  and yet while she saw it growthismonstrous little mysteryshe couldnt feel sorry that she was going outwith olives cousin</s>  as i have already said she had become nervous</s>  shewent to put on her hat but at the door of the room she stopped turnedround and presented herself to her visitor with a small spot in eithercheek which had appeared there within the instant</s>  i have suggestedthis because it seems to me i ought to do something for youinreturn she said</s>  its nothing simply sitting there with me</s>  and wehavent got anything else</s>  this is our only hospitality</s>  and the dayseems so splendid</s> the modesty the sweetness of this little explanation with a kind ofintimated desire constituting almost an appeal for rightness whichseemed to pervade it left a fragrance in the air after she hadvanished</s>  ransom walked up and down the room with his hands in hispockets under the influence of it without taking up even once the bookabout mrs</s>  foat</s>  he occupied the time in asking himself by whatperversity of fate or of inclination such a charming creature wasranting upon platforms and living in olive chancellors pocket or how aranter and sycophant could possibly be so engaging</s>  and she was sodisturbingly beautiful too</s>
 they left the house and as theyproceeded he remembered that he had asked himself earlier how he coulddo honour to such a combination of leisure and ethereal mildness as hehad waked up to that morninga mildness that seemed the very breath ofhis own latitude</s>  this question was answered now to do exactly what hewas doing at that moment was an observance sufficiently festive</s> xxvthey passed through two or three small short streets which with theirlittle wooden houses with still more wooden dooryards looked as ifthey had been constructed by the nearest carpenter and his boyasightless soundless interspaced embryonic regionand entered a longavenue which fringed on either side with fresh villas offeringthemselves trustfully to the public had the distinction of a widepavement of neat red brick</s>  the new paint on the square detached housesshone afar off in the transparent air they had on top little cupolasand belvederes in front a pillared piazza made bare by the indoor lifeof winter on either side a bowwindow or two and everywhere anembellishment of scallops brackets cornices wooden flourishes</s>  theystood for the most part on small eminences lifted above theimpertinence of hedge or paling well up before the world with all thegood conscience which in many cases came as ransom saw and he hadnoticed the same ornament when he traversed with olive the quarter ofboston inhabited by miss birdseye from a silvered number affixed tothe glass above the door in figures huge enough to be read by thepeople who in the periodic horsecars travelled along the middle ofthe avenue</s>  it was to these glittering badges that many of the houses oneither side owed their principal identity</s>  one of the horsecars nowadvanced in the straight spacious distance it was almost the onlyobject that animated the prospect which in its large cleanness itsimplication of strict businesshabits on the part of all the people whowere not there ransom thought very impressive</s>
 as he went on withverena he asked her about the womens convention the year beforewhether it had accomplished much work and she had enjoyed it</s> what do you care about the work it accomplished</s>
 said the girl</s>  youdont take any interest in that</s> you mistake my attitude</s>  i dont like it but i greatly fear it</s> in answer to this verena gave a free laugh</s>  i dont believe you fearmuch</s> the bravest men have been afraid of women</s>  wont you even tell mewhether you enjoyed it</s>  i am told you made an immense sensationtherethat you leaped into fame</s> verena never waved off an allusion to her ability her eloquence shetook it seriously without any flutter or protest and had no moremanner about it than if it concerned the goddess minerva</s>  i believe iattracted considerable attention of course thats what olive wantsitpaves the way for future work</s>  i have no doubt i reached many thatwouldnt have been reached otherwise</s>  they think thats my great usetotake hold of the outsiders as it were of those who are prejudiced orthoughtless or who dont care about anything unless its amusing</s>  iwake up the attention</s> thats the class to which i belong ransom said</s>  am i not anoutsider</s>  i wonder whether you would have reached meor waked up myattention</s> verena was silent awhile as they walked he heard the light click ofher boots on the smooth bricks</s>  theni think i have waked it up alittle she replied looking straight before her</s> most assuredly</s>  you have made me wish tremendously to contradict you</s> well thats a good sign</s> i suppose it was very excitingyour convention ransom went on in amoment the sort of thing you would miss very much if you were toreturn to the ancient fold</s> the ancient fold you say very well where women were slaughtered likesheep</s>  oh last june for a week we just quivered</s>  there were delegatesfrom every state and every city we lived in a crowd of people and ofideas the heat

summer evenings we sat in the open windows in her parlourlooking out on the bay with the lights gleaming in the water andtalked over the doings of the morning the speeches the incidents thefresh contributions to the cause</s>  we had some tremendously earnestdiscussions which it would have been a benefit to you to hear or anyman who doesnt think that we can rise to the highest point</s>  then we hadsome refreshmentwe consumed quantities of icecream</s>  said verena inwhom the note of gaiety alternated with that of earnestness almost ofexaltation in a manner which seemed to basil ransom absolutely andfascinatingly original</s>  those were great nights</s>  she added between alaugh and a sigh</s> her description of the convention put the scene before him vividly heseemed to see the crowded overheated hall which he was sure was filledwith carpetbaggers to hear flushed women with loosenedbonnetstrings forcing thin voices into ineffectual shrillness</s>  it madehim angry and all the more angry that he hadnt a reason to think ofthe charming creature at his side being mixed up with such elementspushed and elbowed by them conjoined with them in emulation inunsightly strainings and clappings and shoutings in wordy windyiteration of inanities</s>  worst of all was the idea that she should haveexpressed such a congregation to itself so acceptably have beenacclaimed and applauded by hoarse throats have been lifted up to allthe vulgar multitude as the queen of the occasion</s>  he made thereflexion afterwards that he was singularly illgrounded in his wrathinasmuch as it was none of his business what use miss tarrant chose tomake of her energies and in addition to this nothing else was to havebeen expected of her</s>  but that reflexion was absent now and in itsabsence he saw only the fact that his companion had been odiouslyperverted</s>  well miss tarrant he said with a deeper seriousness thanshowed in his voice i am forced to the painful conclusion that you aresimply ruined</s> ruined</s>  ruined yourself</s> oh i know the kind of women that miss chancellor had at her house andwhat a group you must have made when you looked out at the back bay</s>  itdepresses me very much to think of it</s> we made a lovely interesting group and if we had had a spare minutewe would have been photographed verena said</s> this led him to ask her if she had ever subjected herself to theprocess and she answered that a photographer had been after her as soonas she got back from europe and that she had sat for him and thatthere were certain shops in boston where her portrait could be obtained</s> she gave him this information very simply without pretence of vaguenessof knowledge spoke of the matter rather respectfully indeed as if itmight be of some importance and when he said that he should go and buyone of the little pictures as soon as he returned to town contentedherself with replying well be sure you pick out a good one</s>  he hadnot been altogether without a hope that she would offer to give him onewith her name written beneath which was a mode of acquisition he wouldgreatly have preferred but this evidently had not occurred to herand now as they went further her thought was following a differenttrain</s>  that was proved by her remarking at the end of a silenceinconsequently well it showed i have a great use</s>  as he

beguiled the transit to thelibrary into which she introduced her companion with the air of aperson familiar with the sanctified spot</s>  this edifice a diminishedcopy of the chapel of kings college

heads of working students and the gentlecreak of passing messengersas he took possession in a comprehensiveglance of the wealth and wisdom of the place he felt more than everthe soreness of an opportunity missed but he abstained from expressingit it was too deep for that and in a moment verena had introduced himto a young lady a friend of hers who as she explained was working onthe catalogue and whom she had asked for on entering the library at adesk where another young lady was occupied</s>  miss catching thefirstmentioned young lady presented herself with promptness offeredverena a lowtoned but appreciative greeting and after a littleundertook to explain to ransom the mysteries of the catalogue whichconsisted of a myriad little cards disposed alphabetically in immensechests of drawers</s>  ransom was deeply interested and as with verena hefollowed miss catching about she was so good as to show them theestablishment in all its ramifications he considered with attentionthe young ladys fair ringlets and refined anxious expression sayingto himself that this was in the highest degree a new england type</s> verena found an opportunity to mention to him that she was wrapped up inthe cause and there was a moment during which he was afraid that hiscompanion would expose him to her as one of its traducers but there wasthat in miss catchings manner and in the influence of the lofty hallswhich deprecated loud pleasantry and seemed to say moreover that ifshe were treated to such a revelation she should not know under whatletter to range it</s> now there is one place where perhaps it would be indelicate to take amississippian verena said after this episode</s>  i mean the great placethat towers above the othersthat big building with the beautifulpinnacles which you see from every point</s>  but basil ransom had heardof the great memorial hall he knew what memories it enshrined and theworst that he should have to suffer there and the ornate overtoppingstructure which was the finest piece of architecture he had ever seenhad moreover solicited his enlarged curiosity for the last halfhour</s>  hethought there was rather too much brick about it but it was buttressedcloistered turreted dedicated superscribed as he had never seenanything though it didnt look old it looked significant it covered alarge area and it sprang majestic into the winter air</s>  it was detachedfrom the rest of the collegiate group and stood in a grassy triangle ofits own</s>  as he approached it with verena she suddenly stopped todecline responsibility</s>  now mind if you dont like whats inside itisnt my fault</s> he looked at her an instant smiling</s>  is there anything againstmississippi</s> well no i dont think she is mentioned</s>  but there is great praise ofour young men in the war</s> it says they were brave i suppose</s> yes it says so in latin</s> well so they werei know something about that basil ransom said</s>  imust be brave enough to face themit isnt the first time</s>  and theywent up the low steps and passed into the tall doors</s>  the memorial hallof harvard consists of three main divisions one of them a theatre foracademic ceremonies another a vast refectory covered with a timberedroof hung about with portraits and lighted by stained windows like thehalls of the colleges of oxford and the third the most interesting achamber high dim and severe consecrated to the sons of the universitywho fell in the long civil war</s>  ransom and his companion wandered fromone part of the building to another and stayed their steps at severalimpressive points but they lingered longest in the presence of thewhite ranged tablets each of which in its proud sad clearness isinscribed with the name of a studentsoldier</s>  the effect of the place issingularly noble and solemn and it is impossible to feel it without alifting of the heart</s>  it stands there for duty and honour it speaks ofsacrifice and example seems a kind of temple to youth manhoodgenerosity</s>  most of them were young all were in their prime and all ofthem had fallen this simple idea hovers before the visitor and makeshim read with tenderness each name and placenames often without otherhistory and forgotten southern battles</s>  for ransom these things werenot a challenge nor a taunt they touched him with respect with thesentiment of beauty</s>  he was capable of being a generous foeman and heforgot now the whole question of sides and parties the simple emotionof the old fightingtime came back to him and the monument around himseemed an embodiment of that memory it arched over friends as well asenemies the victims of defeat as well as the sons of triumph</s>
it is very beautifulbut i think it is very dreadful</s>  this remarkfrom verena called him back to the present</s>  its a real sin to put upsuch a building just to glorify a lot of bloodshed</s>  if it wasnt somajestic i would have it pulled down</s> that is delightful feminine logic</s>  ransom answered</s>  if when womenhave the conduct of affairs they fight as well as they reason surelyfor them too we shall have to set up memorials</s> verena retorted that they would reason so well they would have no needto fightthey would usher in the reign of peace</s>  but this is verypeaceful too she added looking about her and she sat down on a lowstone ledge as if to enjoy the influence of the scene</s>  ransom left heralone for ten minutes he wished to take another look at the inscribedtablets and read again the names of the various engagements at severalof which he had been present</s>  when he came back to her she greeted himabruptly with a question which had no reference to the solemnity of thespot</s>  if miss birdseye knew you were coming out to see me cant sheeasily tell olive</s>  then wont olive make her reflexions about yourneglect of herself</s> i dont care for her reflexions</s>  at any rate i asked miss birdseye asa favour not to mention to her that she had met me ransom added</s> verena was silent a moment</s>  your logic is most as good as a womans</s>  dochange your mind and go to see her now she went on</s>  she will probablybe at home by the time you get to charles street</s>  if she was a littlestrange a little stiff with you before i know just how she must havebeen all that will be different today</s> why will it be different</s> oh she will be easier more genial much softer</s> i dont believe it said ransom and his scepticism seemed none theless complete because it was light and smiling</s> she is much happier nowshe can afford not to mind you</s> not to mind me</s>  thats a nice inducement for a gentleman to go and seea lady</s> well she will be more gracious because she feels now that she is moresuccessful</s> you mean because she has brought you out</s>  oh i have no doubt that hascleared the air for her immensely and you have improved her very much</s> but i have got a charming impression out here and i have no wish to putanotherwhich wont be charming anyhow you arrange iton top of it</s> well she will be sure to know you have been round here at any rateverena rejoined</s> how will she know unless you tell her</s> i tell her everything said the girl and now as soon as she hadspoken she blushed</s>  he stood before her tracing a figure on the mosaicpavement with his cane conscious that in a moment they had become moreintimate</s>  they were discussing their affairs which had nothing to dowith the heroic symbols that surrounded them but their affairs hadsuddenly grown so serious that there was no want of decency in theirlingering there for the purpose</s>  the implication that his visit mightremain as a secret between them made them both feel it differently</s>  toask her to keep it so would have been as it seemed to ransom aliberty and moreover he didnt care so much as that but if she wereto prefer to do so such a preference would only make him consider themore that his expedition had been a success</s> oh then you can tell her this</s>  he said in a moment</s> if i shouldnt it would be the first and verena checked herself</s> you must arrange that with your conscience ransom went on laughing</s> they came out of the hall passed down the steps and emerged from thedelta as that portion of the college precinct is called</s>  the afternoonhad begun to wane but the air was filled with a pink brightness andthere was a cool pure smell a vague breath of spring</s> well if i dont tell olive then you must leave me here said verenastopping in the path and putting out a hand of farewell</s> i dont understand</s>  what has that to do with it</s>  besides i thought yousaid you must tell ransom added</s>  in playing with the subject thisway in enjoying her visible hesitation he was slightly conscious of amans brutalityof being pushed by an impulse to test her goodnaturewhich seemed to have no limit</s>  it showed no sign of perturbation as sheansweredwell i want to be freeto do as i think best</s>  and if there is achance of my keeping it back there mustnt be anything morethere mustnot mr</s>  ransom really</s> anything more</s>  why what are you afraid there will beif i shouldsimply walk home with you</s> i must go alone i must hurry back to mother she said for all reply</s> and she again put out her hand which he had not taken before</s> of course he took it now and even held it a moment he didnt likebeing dismissed and was thinking of pretexts to linger</s>  miss birdseyesaid you would convert me but you havent yet it came into his headto say</s> you cant tell yet wait a little</s>  my influence is peculiar itsometimes comes out a long time afterwards</s>  this speech on verenaspart was evidently perfunctory and the grandeur of her selfreferencejocular she was much more serious when she went on quickly do youmean to say miss birdseye promised you that</s> oh yes</s>  talk about influence</s>  you should have seen the influence iobtained over her</s> well what good will it do if im going to tell olive about yourvisit</s> well you see i think she hopes you wont</s>  she believes you are goingto convert me privatelyso that i shall blaze forth suddenly out ofthe darkness of mississippi as a firstclass proselyte very effectiveand dramatic</s> verena struck basil ransom as constantly simple but there were momentswhen her candour seemed to him preternatural</s>  if i thought that wouldbe the effect i might make an exception she remarked speaking as ifsuch a result were after all possible</s> oh miss tarrant you will convert me enough any way said the youngman</s> enough</s>
enough to make me terribly unhappy</s> she looked at him a moment evidently not understanding but she tossedhim a retort at a venture turned away and took her course homeward</s> the retort was that if he should be unhappy it would serve him rightaform of words that committed her to nothing</s>  as he returned to boston hesaw how curious he should be to learn whether she had betrayed him asit were to miss chancellor</s>  he might learn through mrs</s>  luna thatwould almost reconcile him to going to see her again</s>  olive wouldmention it in writing to her sister and adeline would repeat thecomplaint</s>  perhaps she herself would even make him a scene about itthat would be for him part of the unhappiness he had foretold toverena tarrant</s> xxvimrs</s>  henry burrage at home wednesday evening march 26th at halfpastnine oclock</s>  it was in consequence of having received a card withthese words inscribed upon it that basil ransom presented himself onthe evening she had designated at the house of a lady he had neverheard of before</s>  the account of the relation of effect to cause is notcomplete however unless i mention that the card bore furthermore inthe lefthand lower corner the words an address from miss verenatarrant</s>  he had an idea it came mainly from the look and even theodour of the engraved pasteboard that mrs</s>  burrage was a member of thefashionable world and it was with considerable surprise that he foundhimself in such an element</s>  he wondered what had induced a denizen ofthat fine air to send him an invitation then he said to himself thatobviously verena tarrant had simply requested that this should be done</s> mrs</s>  henry burrage whoever she might be had asked her if she shouldntlike some of her own friends to be present and she had said oh yesand mentioned him in the happy group</s>  she had been able to give mrs</s> burrage his address for had it not been contained in the short letterhe despatched to monadnoc place soon after his return from boston inwhich he thanked miss tarrant afresh for the charming hour she hadenabled him to spend at cambridge</s>  she had not answered his letter atthe time but mrs</s>  burrages card was a very good answer</s>  such a missivedeserved a rejoinder and it was by way of rejoinder that he entered thestreet car which on the evening of march 26th was to deposit him at acorner adjacent to mrs</s>  burrages dwelling</s>  he almost never went toevening parties he knew scarcely any one who gave them though mrs</s> luna had broken him in a little and he was sure this occasion was offestive intention would have nothing in common with the nocturnalexercises at miss birdseyes but he would have exposed himself toalmost any social discomfort in order to see verena tarrant on theplatform</s>  the platform it evidently was to beprivate if notpublicsince one was admitted by a ticket given away if not sold</s>  hetook his in his pocket quite ready to present it at the door</s>  it wouldtake some time for me to explain the contradiction to the reader butbasil ransoms desire to be present at one of verenas regularperformances was not diminished by the fact that he detested her viewsand thought the whole business a poor perversity</s>  he understood her nowvery well since his visit to cambridge he saw she was honest andnatural she had queer bad lectureblood in her veins and a comicallyfalse idea of the aptitude of little girls for conducting movements buther enthusiasm was of the purest her illusions had a fragrance and sofar as the mania for producing herself personally was concerned it hadbeen distilled into her by people who worked her for ends which to basilransom could only appear insane</s>  she was a touching ingenuous victimunconscious of the pernicious forces which were hurrying her to herruin</s>  with this idea of ruin there had already associated itself in theyoung mans mind the ideaa good deal more dim and incompleteofrescue and it was the disposition to confirm himself in the view thather charm was her own and her fallacies her absurdity a merereflexion of unlucky circumstance that led him to make an effort tobehold her in the position in which he could least bear to think of her</s> such a glimpse was all that was wanted to prove to him that she was aperson for whom he might open an unlimited credit of tender compassion</s> he expected to sufferto suffer deliciously</s> by the time he had crossed mrs</s>  burrages threshold there was no doubtwhatever in his mind that he was in the fashionable world</s>  it wasembodied strikingly in the stout elderly ugly lady dressed in abrilliant colour with a twinkle of jewels and a bosom much uncoveredwho stood near the door of the first room and with whom the peoplepassing in before him were shaking hands</s>  ransom made her a mississipianbow and she said she was delighted to see him while people behind himpressed him forward</s>  he yielded to the impulsion and found himself in agreat saloon amid lights and flowers where the company was dense andthere were more twinkling smiling ladies with uncovered bosoms</s>  it wascertainly the fashionable world for there was no one there whom he hadever seen before</s>  the walls of the room were covered with picturesthevery ceiling was painted and framed</s>  the people pushed each other alittle edged about advanced and retreated looking at each other withdiffering facessometimes blandly unperceivingly sometimes with aharshness of contemplation a kind of cruelty ransom thought sometimeswith sudden nods and grimaces inarticulate murmurs followed by a quickreaction a sort of gloom</s>  he was now absolutely certain that he was inthe best society</s>  he was carried further and further forward and sawthat another room stretched beyond the one he had entered in whichthere was a sort of little stage covered with a red cloth and animmense collection of chairs arranged in rows</s>  he became aware thatpeople looked at him as well as at each other rather more indeedthan at each other and he wondered whether it were very visible in hisappearance that his being there was a kind of exception</s>  he didnt knowhow much his head looked over the heads of others or that his browncomplexion fuliginous eye and straight black hair the leonine fall ofwhich i mentioned in the first pages of this narrative gave him thatrelief which in the best society has the great advantage of suggestinga topic</s>  but there were other topics besides as was proved by afragment of conversation between two ladies which reached his earwhile he stood rather wistfully wondering where verena tarrant might be</s> are you a member</s>  one of the ladies said to the other</s>  i didnt knowyou had joined</s> oh i havent nothing would induce me</s> thats not fair you have all the fun and none of the responsibility</s> oh thethe fun</s>  exclaimed the second lady</s> you neednt abuse us or i will never invite you said the first</s> well i thought it was meant to be improving thats all i mean verygood for the mind</s>  now this woman tonight isnt she from boston</s> yes i believe they have brought her on just for this</s> well you must be pretty desperate when you have got to go to bostonfor your entertainment</s> well theres a similar society there and i never heard of theirsending to new york</s> of course not they think they have got everything</s>  but doesnt it makeyour life a burden thinking what you can possibly have</s> oh dear no</s>  i am going to have professor gougenheimall about thetalmud</s>  you must come</s> well ill come said the second lady but nothing would induce me tobe a regular member</s> whatever the mystic circle might be ransom agreed with the second ladythat regular membership must have terrors and he admired herindependence in such an artificial world</s>  a considerable part of thecompany had now directed itself to the further apartmentpeople hadbegun to occupy the chairs to confront the empty platform</s>  he reachedthe wide doors and saw that the place was a spacious musicroomdecorated in white and gold with a polished floor and marble busts ofcomposers on brackets attached to the delicate panels</s>  he forbore toenter however being shy about taking a seat and seeing that theladies were arranging themselves first</s>  he turned back into the firstroom to wait till the audience had massed itself conscious that evenif he were behind every one he should be able to make a long neck andhere suddenly in a corner his eyes rested upon olive chancellor</s>  shewas seated a little apart in an angle of the room and she was lookingstraight at him but as soon as she perceived that he saw her shedropped her eyes giving no sign of recognition</s>  ransom hesitated amoment but the next he went straight over to her</s>  it had been in hismind that if verena tarrant was there she would be there an instincttold him that miss chancellor would not allow her dear friend to come tonew york without her</s>  it was very possible she meant to cuthimespecially if she knew of his having cut her the other week inboston but it was his duty to take for granted she would speak to himuntil the contrary should be definitely proved</s>  though he had seen heronly twice he remembered well how acutely shy she was capable of beingand he thought it possible one of these spasms had seized her at thepresent time</s> when he stood before her he found his conjecture perfectly just she waswhite with the intensity of her selfconsciousness she was altogetherin a very uncomfortable state</s>  she made no response to his offer toshake hands with her and he saw that she would never go through thatceremony again</s>  she looked up at him when he spoke to her and her lipsmoved but her face was intensely grave and her eye had almost afeverish light</s>  she had evidently got into her corner to be out of theway he recognised in her the air of an interloper as he had felt it inhimself</s>  the small sofa on which she had placed herself had the form towhich the french give the name of causeuse there was room on it forjust another person and ransom asked her with a cheerful accent if hemight sit down beside her</s>  she turned towards him when he had done soturned everything but her eyes and opened and shut her fan while shewaited for her fit of diffidence to pass away</s>  ransom himself did notwait he took a jocular tone about their encounter asking her if shehad come to new york to rouse the people</s>  she glanced round the roomthe backs of mrs</s>  burrages guests mainly were presented to them andtheir position was partly masked by a pyramid of flowers which rose froma pedestal close to olives end of the sofa and diffused a fragrance inthe air</s> do you call these the people</s>  she asked</s> i havent the least idea</s>  i dont know who any of them are not evenwho mrs</s>  henry burrage is i simply received an invitation</s> miss chancellor gave him no information on the point he had mentionedshe only said in a moment do you go wherever you are invited</s> why i go if i think i may find you there the young man repliedgallantly</s>  my card mentioned that miss tarrant would give an addressand i knew that wherever she is you are not far off</s>  i have heard youare inseparable from mrs</s>  luna</s> yes we are inseparable</s>  that is exactly why i am here</s> its the fashionable world then you are going to stir up</s> olive remained for some time with her eyes fastened to the floor thenshe flashed them up at her interlocutor</s>  its a part of our life to goanywhereto carry our work where it seems most needed</s>  we have taughtourselves to stifle repulsion distaste</s> oh i think this is very amusing said ransom</s>  its a beautifulhouse and there are some very pretty faces</s>  we havent anything sobrilliant in mississippi</s> to everything he said olive offered at first a momentary silence butthe worst of her shyness was apparently leaving her</s> are you successful in new york</s>  do you like it</s>  she presently askeduttering the inquiry in a tone of infinite melancholy as if the eternalsense of duty forced it from her lips</s> oh successful</s>  i am not successful as you and miss tarrant are forto my barbaric eyes it is a great sign of prosperity to be theheroines of an occasion like this</s> do i look like the heroine of an occasion</s>  asked olive chancellorwithout an intention of humour but with an effect that was almostcomical</s> you would if you didnt hide yourself away</s>  are you not going into theother room to hear the speech</s>  everything is prepared</s> i am going when i am notifiedwhen i am invited</s> there was considerable majesty in her tone and ransom saw thatsomething was wrong that she felt neglected</s>  to see that she was asticklish with others as she had been with him made him feel forgivingand there was in his manner a perfect disposition to forget theirdifferences as he said oh there is plenty of time the place isnthalf full yet</s> she made no direct rejoinder to this but she asked him about his motherand sisters what news he received from the south</s>  have they anyhappiness</s>  she inquired rather as if she warned him to take care notto pretend they had</s>  he neglected her warning to the point of sayingthat there was one happiness they always hadthat of having learned notto think about it too much and to make the best of their circumstances</s> she listened to this with an air of great reserve and apparentlythought he had wished to give her a lesson for she suddenly broke outyou mean that you have traced a certain line for them and that thatsall you know about it</s> ransom stared at her surprised he felt now that she would alwayssurprise him</s>  ah dont be rough with me he said in his softsouthern voice dont you remember how you knocked me about when icalled on you in boston</s> you hold us in chains and then when we writhe in our agony you saywe dont behave prettily</s>  these words which did not lessen ransomswonderment were the young ladys answer to his deprecatory speech</s>  shesaw that he was honestly bewildered and that in a moment more he wouldlaugh at her as he had done a year and a half before she remembered itas if it had been yesterday and to stop that off at any cost shewent on hurriedlyif you listen to miss tarrant you will know what imean</s> oh miss tarrantmiss tarrant</s>  and basil ransoms laughter came</s> she had not escaped that mockery after all and she looked at himsharply now her embarrassment having quite cleared up</s>  what do youknow about her</s>  what observation have you had</s> ransom met her eye and for a moment they scrutinised each other</s>  didshe know of his interview with verena a month before and was herreserve simply the wish to place on him the burden of declaring that hehad been to boston since they last met and yet had not called incharles street</s>  he thought there was suspicion in her face but inregard to verena she would always be suspicious</s>  if he had done at thatmoment just what would gratify him he would have said to her that heknew a great deal about miss tarrant having lately had a long walk andtalk with her but he checked himself with the reflexion that if verenahad not betrayed him it would be very wrong in him to betray her</s>  thesweetness of the idea that she should have thought the episode of hisvisit to monadnoc place worth placing under the rose was quenched forthe moment in his regret at not being able to let his disagreeablecousin know that he had passed her over</s>  dont you remember myhearing her speak that night at miss birdseyes</s>  he said presently</s> and i met her the next day at your house you know</s> she has developed greatly since then olive remarked dryly and ransomfelt sure that verena had held her tongue</s> at this moment a gentleman made his way through the clusters of mrs</s> burrages guests and presented himself to olive</s>  if you will do me thehonour to take my arm i will find a good seat for you in the other room</s> its getting to be time for miss tarrant to reveal herself</s>  i have beentaking her into the pictureroom there were some things she wanted tosee</s>  she is with my mother now he added as if miss chancellors graveface constituted a sort of demand for an explanation of her friendsabsence</s>  she said she was a little nervous so i thought we would justmove about</s> its the first time i have ever heard of that</s>  said olive chancellorpreparing to surrender herself to the young mans guidance</s>  he told herthat he had reserved the best seat for her it was evidently his desireto conciliate her to treat her as a person of importance</s>  beforeleading her away he shook hands with ransom and remarked that he wasvery glad to see him and ransom saw that he must be the master of thehouse though he could scarcely be the son of the stout lady in thedoorway</s>  he was a fresh pleasant handsome young man with a brightfriendly manner he recommended ransom to take a seat in the other roomwithout delay if he had never heard miss tarrant he would have one ofthe greatest pleasures of his life</s> oh mr</s>  ransom only comes to ventilate his prejudices miss chancellorsaid as she turned her back to her kinsman</s>  he shrank from pushing intothe front of the company which was now rapidly filling the musicroomand contented himself with lingering in the doorway where severalgentlemen were stationed</s>  the seats were all occupied all that issave one towards which he saw miss chancellor and her companion directthemselves squeezing and edging past the people who were standing upagainst the walls</s>  this was quite in front close to the littleplatform every one noticed olive as she went and ransom heard agentleman near him say to anotheri guess shes one of the same kind</s> he looked for verena but she was apparently keeping out of sight</s> suddenly he felt himself smartly tapped on the back and turning roundperceived mrs</s>  luna who had been prodding him with her fan</s> xxviiyou wont speak to me in my own housethat i have almost grown usedto but if you are going to pass me over in public i think you mightgive me warning first</s>  this was only her archness and he knew what tomake of that now she was dressed in yellow and looked very plump andgay</s>  he wondered at the unerring instinct by which she had discoveredhis exposed quarter</s>  the outer room was completely empty she had comein at the further door and found the field free for her operations</s>  heoffered to find her a place where she could see and hear miss tarrantto get her a chair to stand on even if she wished to look over theheads of the gentlemen in the doorway a proposal which she greeted withthe inquirydo you suppose i came here for the sake of thatchatterbox</s>  havent i told you what i think of her</s> well you certainly did not come here for my sake said ransomanticipating this insinuation for you couldnt possibly have known iwas coming</s> i guessed ita presentiment told me</s>  mrs</s>  luna declared and shelooked up at him with searching accusing eyes</s>  i know what you havecome for she cried in a moment</s>  you never mentioned to me that youknew mrs</s>  burrage</s> i donti never had heard of her till she asked me</s> then why in the world did she ask you</s> ransom had spoken a trifle rashly it came over him quickly that therewere reasons why he had better not have said that</s>  but almost as quicklyhe covered up his mistake</s>  i suppose your sister was so good as to askfor a card for me</s> my sister</s>  my grandmother</s>  i know how olive loves you</s>  mr</s>  ransom youare very deep</s>  she had drawn him well into the room out of earshot ofthe group in the doorway and he felt that if she should be able tocompass her wish she would organise a little entertainment for herselfin the outer drawingroom in opposition to miss tarrants address</s> please come and sit down here a moment we shall be quite undisturbed</s> i have something very particular to say to you</s>  she led the way to thelittle sofa in the corner where he had been talking with olive a fewminutes before and he accompanied her with extreme reluctancegrudging the moments that he should be obliged to give to her</s>  he hadquite forgotten that he once had a vision of spending his life in hersociety and he looked at his watch as he made the observationi havent the least idea of losing any of the sport in there youknow</s> he felt the next instant that he oughtnt to have said that eitherbut he was irritated disconcerted and he couldnt help it</s>  it was inthe nature of a gallant mississippian to do everything a lady asked himand he had never remarkable as it may appear been in the position offinding such a request so incompatible with his own desires as now</s>  itwas a new predicament for mrs</s>  luna evidently meant to keep him if shecould</s>  she looked round the room more and more pleased at their havingit to themselves and for the moment said nothing more about thesingularity of his being there</s>  on the contrary she became freshlyjocular remarked that now they had got hold of him they wouldnt easilylet him go they would make him entertain them induce him to give alectureon the lights and shadows of southern life or the socialpeculiarities of mississippibefore the wednesday club</s> and what in the world is the wednesday club</s>  i suppose its what thoseladies were talking about ransom said</s> i dont know your ladies but the wednesday club is this thing</s>

has comeround formerlyit comes only once in the winter for eachi am toldshe has usually had very good music</s>  but that is thought rather a baseevasion a begging of the question the vulgar set can easily keep upwith them on music</s>  so mrs</s>  burrage conceived the extraordinaryideaand it was wonderful to hear how mrs</s>  luna pronounced thatadjectiveof sending on to boston for that girl</s>  it was her son ofcourse who put it into her head he has been at cambridge for someyearsthats where verena lived you knowand he was as thick with heras you please out there</s>  now that he is no longer there it suits himvery well to have her here</s>  she is coming on a visit to his mother whenolive goes</s>  i asked them to stay with me but olive declinedmajestically she said they wished to be in some place where they wouldbe free to receive sympathising friends</s>  so they are staying at someextraordinary kind of new jerusalem boardinghouse in tenth streetolive thinks its her duty to go to such places</s>  i was greatly surprisedthat she should let verena be drawn into such a worldly crowd as thisbut she told me they had made up their minds not to let any occasionslip that they could sow the seed of truth in drawingrooms as well asin workshops and that if a single person was brought round to theirideas they should have been justified in coming on</s>  thats what they aredoing in theresowing the seed but you shall not be the one thatsbrought round i shall take care of that</s>  have you seen my delightfulsister yet</s>  the way she does arrange herself when she wants to protestagainst frills</s>  she looks as if she thought it pretty barren groundround here now she has come to see it</s>  i dont think she thinks you canbe saved in a french dress anyhow</s>  i must say i call it a very baseevasion of mrs</s>  burrages producing verena tarrant its worse than themeretricious music</s>  why didnt she honestly send for a ballerina fromniblosif she wanted a young woman capering about on a platform</s>  theydont care a fig about poor olives ideas its only because verena hasstrange hair and shiny eyes and gets herself up like aprestidigitators

believe mebut i assure you that the cut is revolutionary andthats a salve to olives conscience</s> ransom was surprised to hear that he looked as if he didnt believe herfor he had found himself after his first uneasiness listening withconsiderable interest to her account of the circumstances under whichmiss tarrant was visiting new york</s>  after a moment as the result ofsome private reflexion he propounded this question is the son of thelady of the house a handsome young man very polite in a white vest</s> i dont know the colour of his vestbut he has a kind of fawningmanner</s>  verena judges from that that he is in love with her</s> perhaps he is said ransom</s>  you say it was his idea to get her tocome on</s> oh he likes to flirt that is highly probable</s> perhaps she has brought him

got him the invitation</s> i my dear</s>  that would be quite at variance with my attitude ofdiscouragement</s> then she simply sent it herself</s>
whom do you mean by she</s> mrs</s>  burrage of course</s> i thought that you might mean verena said mrs</s>

 miss chancellor murmured</s> are you very sure that last night was only the third time</s>  mrs</s>  lunawent on</s> olive threw back her head and swept her sister from her bonnet to herlowest flounce</s>  you have no right to hint at such a thing as thatunless you know</s> oh i knowi know at any rate more than you do</s>  and then mrs</s>  lunasitting with her sister much withdrawn in one of the windows of thebig hot faded parlour of the boardinghouse in tenth street wherethere was a rug before the chimney representing a newfoundland dogsaving a child from drowning and a row of chromolithographs on thewalls imparted to her the impression she had received the eveningbeforethe impression of basil ransoms keen curiosity about verenatarrant</s>  verena must have asked mrs</s>  burrage to send him a card andasked it without mentioning the fact to olivefor wouldnt olivecertainly have remembered it</s>  it was no use her saying that mrs</s>  burragemight have sent it of her own movement because she wasnt aware of hisexistence and why should she be</s>  basil ransom himself had told her hedidnt know mrs</s>  burrage</s>  mrs</s>  luna knew whom he knew and whom hedidnt or at least the sort of people and they were not the sort thatbelonged to the wednesday club</s>  that was one reason why she didnt careabout him for any intimate relationthat he didnt seem to have anytaste for making nice friends</s>  olive would know what her taste was inthis respect though it wasnt that young womans own any more than his</s> it was positive that the suggestion about the card could only have comefrom verena</s>  at any rate olive could easily ask or if she was afraid ofher telling a fib she could ask mrs</s>  burrage</s>  it was true mrs</s>  burragemight have been put on her guard by verena and would perhaps inventsome other account of the matter therefore olive had better justbelieve what she believed that verena had secured his presence at theparty and had had private reasons for doing so</s>  it is to be feared thatransoms remark to mrs</s>  luna the night before about her having lost herhead was near to the mark for if she had not been blinded by herrancour she would have guessed the horror with which she inspired hersister when she spoke in that offhand way of verenas lying and mrs</s> burrages lying</s>  did people lie like that in mrs</s>  lunas set</s>  it wasolives plan of life not to lie and attributing a similar dispositionto people she liked it was impossible for her to believe that verenahad had the intention of deceiving her</s>  mrs</s>  luna in a calmer hourmight also have divined that olive would make her private comments onthe strange story of basil ransoms having made up to verena out ofpique at adelines rebuff for this was the account of the matter thatshe now offered to miss chancellor</s>  olive did two things she listenedintently and eagerly judging there was distinct danger in the airwhich however she had not wanted mrs</s>  luna to tell her havingperceived it for herself the night before and she saw that pooradeline was fabricating fearfully that the rebuff was altogether aninvention</s>  mr</s>  ransom was evidently preoccupied with verena but he hadnot needed mrs</s>  lunas cruelty to make him so</s>  so olive maintained anattitude of great reserve she did not take upon herself to announcethat her own version was that adeline for reasons absolutelyimperceptible to others had tried to catch basil ransom had failed inher attempt and furious at seeing verena preferred to a person of herimportance olive remembered the spretae injuria formae now wishedto do both him and the girl an ill turn</s>  this would be accomplished ifshe could induce olive to interfere</s>  miss chancellor was conscious of anabundant readiness to interfere but it was not because she cared foradelines mortification</s>  i am not sure even that she did not think herfiasco but another illustration of her sisters general uselessnessand rather despise her for it being perfectly able at once to hold thatnothing is baser than the effort to entrap a man and to think it veryignoble to have to renounce it because you cant</s>  olive kept thesereflexions to herself but she went so far as to say to her sister thatshe didnt see where the pique came in</s>  how could it hurt adeline thathe should turn his attention to verena</s>  what was verena to her</s> why olive chancellor how can you ask</s>  mrs</s>  luna boldly responded</s> isnt verena everything to you and arent you everything to me andwouldnt an attempta successful oneto take verena away from youknock you up fearfully and shouldnt i suffer as you know i suffer bysympathy</s> i have said that it was miss chancellors plan of life not to lie butsuch a plan was compatible with a kind of consideration for the truthwhich led her to shrink from producing it on poor occasions</s>  so shedidnt say dear me adeline what humbug</s>  you know you hate verena andwould be very glad if she were drowned</s>  she only said well i seebut its very roundabout</s>  what she did see was that mrs</s>  luna was eagerto help her to stop off basil ransom from making head as the phrasewas and the fact that her motive was spite and not tenderness for thebostonians would not make her assistance less welcome if the dangerwere real</s>  she herself had a nervous dread but she had that abouteverything still adeline had perhaps seen something and what in theworld did she mean by her reference to verenas having had secretmeetings</s>  when pressed on this point mrs</s>  luna could only say that shedidnt pretend to give definite information and she wasnt a spyanyway but that the night before he had positively flaunted in her facehis admiration for the girl his enthusiasm for her way of standing upthere</s>  of course he hated her ideas but he was quite conceited enoughto think she would give them up</s>  perhaps it was all directed atheras if she cared</s>  it would depend a good deal on the girl herselfcertainly if there was any likelihood of verenas being affected sheshould advise olive to look out</s>  she knew best what to do it was onlyadelines duty to give her the benefit of her own impression whethershe was thanked for it or not</s>  she only wished to put her on her guardand it was just like olive to receive such information so coldly shewas the most disappointing woman she knew</s> miss chancellors coldness was not diminished by this rebuke for it hadcome over her that after all she had never opened herself at that rateto adeline had never let her see the real intensity of her desire tokeep the sort of danger there was now a question of away from verenahad given her no warrant for regarding her as her friends keeper sothat she was taken aback by the flatness of mrs</s>  lunas assumption thatshe was ready to enter into a conspiracy to circumvent and frustrate thegirl</s>  olive put on all her majesty to dispel this impression and if shecould not help being aware that she made mrs</s>  luna still angrier on thewhole than at first she felt that she would much rather disappoint herthan give herself away to herespecially as she was intensely eager toprofit by her warning</s> xxxmrs</s>  luna would have been still less satisfied with the manner in whicholive received her proffered assistance had she known how manyconfidences that reticent young woman might have made her in return</s> olives whole life now was a matter for whispered communications shefelt this herself as she sought the privacy of her own apartment afterher interview with her sister</s>  she had for the moment time to thinkverena having gone out with mr</s>  burrage who had made an appointment thenight before to call for her to drive at that early hour</s>  they had otherengagements in the afternoonthe principal of which was to meet a groupof earnest people at the house of one of the great local promoters</s> olive would whisk verena off to these appointments directly after lunchshe flattered herself that she could arrange matters so that there wouldnot be half an hour in the day during which basil ransom complacentlycalling would find the bostonians in the house</s>  she had had this wellin mind when at mrs</s>  burrages she was driven to give him theiraddress and she had had it also in mind that she would ask verena as aspecial favour to accompany her back to boston on the next day but onewhich was the morning of the morrow</s>  there had been considerable talk ofher staying a few days with mrs</s>  burragestaying on after her owndeparture but verena backed out of it spontaneously seeing how theidea worried her friend</s>  olive had accepted the sacrifice and theirvisit to new york was now cut down in intention to four days one ofwhich the moment she perceived whither basil ransom was tending misschancellor promised herself also to suppress</s>  she had not mentioned thatto verena yet she hesitated a little having a slightly bad conscienceabout the concessions she had already obtained from her friend</s>  verenamade such concessions with a generosity which caused ones heart to achefor admiration even while one asked for them and never once had oliveknown her to demand the smallest credit for any virtue she showed inthis way or to bargain for an instant about any effort she made tooblige</s>  she had been delighted with the idea of spending a week undermrs</s>  burrages roof she had said too that she believed her motherwould die happy not that there was the least prospect of mrs</s>  tarrantsdying if she could hear of her having such an experience as that andyet perceiving how solemn olive looked about it how she blanched andbrooded at the prospect she had offered to give it up with a smilesweeter if possible than any that had ever sat in her eyes</s>  olive knewwhat that meant for her knew what a power of enjoyment she still hadin spite of the tension of their common purpose their vital work whichhad now as they equally felt passed into the stage of realisation offruition and that is why her conscience rather pricked her forconsenting to this further act of renunciation especially as theirposition seemed really so secure on the part of one who had alreadygiven herself away so sublimely</s> secure as their position might be olive called herself a blind idiotfor having in spite of all her first shrinkings agreed to bring verenato new york</s>  verena had jumped at the invitation the veryunexpectedness of which on mrs</s>  burrages partit was such an odd ideato have come to a mere worldlingcarried a kind of persuasion with it</s> olives immediate sentiment had been an instinctive general fear butlater she had dismissed that as unworthy she had decided and such adecision was nothing new that where their mission was concerned theyought to face everything</s>  such an opportunity would contribute too muchto verenas reputation and authority to justify a refusal at the biddingof apprehensions which were after all only vague</s>  olives specificterrors and dangers had by this time very much blown over basil ransomhad given no sign of life for ages and henry burrage had certainly gothis quietus before they went to europe</s>  if it had occurred to his motherthat she might convert verena into the animating principle of a bigsoiree she was at least acting in good faith for it could be no moreher wish today that he should marry selah tarrants daughter than itwas her wish a year before</s>  and then they should do some good to thebenighted the most benighted the fashionable benighted they shouldperhaps make them furiousthere was always some good in that</s>  lastlyolive was conscious of a personal temptation in the matter she was notinsensible to the pleasure of appearing in a distinguished new yorkcircle as a representative woman an important bostonian the promptercolleague associate of one of the most original girls of the time</s> basil ransom was the person she had least expected to meet at mrs</s> burrages it had been her belief that they might easily spend four daysin a city of more than a million of inhabitants without thatdisagreeable accident</s>  but it had occurred nothing was wanting to makeit seem serious and setting her teeth she shook herself morallyhard for having fallen into the trap of fate</s>  well she would scrambleout with only a scare probably</s>  henry burrage was very attentive butsomehow she didnt fear him now and it was only natural he should feelthat he couldnt be polite enough after they had consented to beexploited in that worldly way by his mother</s>  the other danger was theworst the palpitation of her strange dread the night of missbirdseyes party came back to her</s>  mr</s>  burrage seemed indeed aprotection she reflected with relief that it had been arranged thatafter taking verena to drive in the park and see the museum of art inthe morning they should in the evening dine with him at delmonicos hewas to invite another gentleman and go afterwards to the german opera</s> olive had kept all this to herself as i have said revealing to hersister neither the vividness of her prevision that basil ransom wouldlook blank when he came down to tenth street and learned they hadflitted nor the eagerness of her desire just to find herself once morein the boston train</s>  it had been only this prevision that sustained herwhen she gave mr</s>  ransom their number</s> verena came to her room shortly before luncheon to let her know she hadreturned and while they sat there waiting to stop their ears when thegong announcing the repast was beaten at the foot of the stairs by anegro in a white jacket she narrated to her friend her adventures withmr</s>  burrageexpatiated on the beauty of the park the splendour andinterest of the museum the wonder of the young mans acquaintance witheverything it contained the swiftness of his horses the softness ofhis english cart the pleasure of rolling at that pace over roads asfirm as marble the entertainment he promised them for the evening</s> olive listened in serious silence she saw verena was quite carriedaway of course she hadnt gone so far with her without knowing thatphase</s> did mr</s>  burrage try to make love to you</s>  miss chancellor inquired atlast without a smile</s> verena had taken off her hat to arrange her feather and as she placedit on her head again her uplifted arms making a frame for her face shesaid yes i suppose it was meant for love</s> olive waited for her to tell more to tell how she had treated him kepthim in his place made him feel that that question was over long agobut as verena gave her no further information she did not insistconscious as she always was that in such a relation as theirs thereshould be a great respect on either side for the liberty of each</s>  shehad never yet infringed on verenas and of course she wouldnt beginnow</s>  moreover with the request that she meant presently to make of hershe felt that she must be discreet</s>  she wondered whether henry burragewere really going to begin again whether his mother had only beenacting in his interest in getting them to come on</s>  certainly the brightspot in such a prospect was that if she listened to him she couldntlisten to basil ransom and he had told olive herself last night whenhe put them into their carriage that he hoped to prove to her yet thathe had come round to her gospel</s>  but the old sickness stole upon heragain the faintness of discouragement as she asked herself why in thename of pity verena should listen to any one at all but olivechancellor</s>  again it came over her when she saw the brightness thehappy look the girl brought back as it had done in the earlier monthsthat the great trouble was that weak spot of verenas that soleinfirmity and subtle flaw which she had expressed to her very soonafter they began to live together in saying she remembered it throughthe ineffaceable impression made by her friends avowal ill tell youwhat is the matter with youyou dont dislike men as a class</s>  verenahad replied on this occasion well no i dont dislike them when theyare pleasant</s>  as if organised atrociousness could ever be pleasant</s> olive disliked them most when they were least unpleasant</s>  after alittle at present she remarked referring to henry burrage it is notright of him not decent after your making him feel how while he wasat cambridge he wearied you tormented you</s> oh i didnt show anything said verena gaily</s>  i am learning todissimulate she added in a moment</s>  i suppose you have to as you goalong</s>  i pretend not to notice</s> at this moment the gong sounded for luncheon and the two young womencovered up their ears face to face verena with her quick smile olivewith her pale patience</s>  when they could hear themselves speak thelatter said abruptlyhow did mrs</s>  burrage come to invite mr</s>  ransom to her party</s>  he toldadeline he had never seen her before</s> oh i asked her to send him an invitationafter she had written to meto thank me when it was definitely settled we should come on</s>  she askedme in her letter if there were any friends of mine in the city to whom ishould like her to send cards and i mentioned mr</s>  ransom</s> verena spoke without a single instants hesitation and the only sign ofembarrassment she gave was that she got up from her chair passing inthis manner a little out of olives scrutiny</s>  it was easy for her not tofalter because she was glad of the chance</s>  she wanted to be very simplein all her relations with her friend and of course it was not simple sosoon as she began to keep things back</s>  she could at any rate keep backas little as possible and she felt as if she were making up for adereliction when she answered olives inquiry so promptly</s> you never told me of that miss chancellor remarked in a low tone</s> i didnt want to</s>  i know you dont like him and i thought it wouldgive you pain</s>  yet i wanted him to be therei wanted him to hear</s> what does it matterwhy should you care about him</s> well because he is so awfully opposed</s> how do you know that verena</s> at this point verena began to hesitate</s>  it was not after all so easyto keep back only a little it appeared rather as if one must eithertell everything or hide everything</s>  the former course had alreadypresented itself to her as unduly harsh it was because it seemed sothat she had ended by keeping the incident of basil ransoms visit tomonadnoc place buried in unspoken in unspeakable considerations theonly secret she had in the worldthe only thing that was all her own</s> she was so glad to say what she could without betraying herself that itwas only after she had spoken that she perceived there was a danger ofolives pushing the inquiry to the point where to defend herself as itwere she should be obliged to practise a positive deception and shewas conscious at the same time that the moment her secret was threatenedit became dearer to her</s>  she began to pray silently that olive might notpush for it would be odious it would be impossible to defend herselfby a lie</s>  meanwhile however she had to answer and the way sheanswered was by exclaiming much more quickly than the reflexions i notemight have appeared to permit well if you cant tell from hisappearance</s>  hes the type of the reactionary</s> verena went to the toiletglass to see that she had put on her hatproperly and olive slowly got up in the manner of a person not in theleast eager for food</s>  let him react as he likesfor heavens sakedont mind him</s>  that was miss chancellors rejoinder and verena feltthat it didnt say all that was in her mind</s>  she wished she would comedown to luncheon for she at least was honestly hungry</s>  she evensuspected olive had an idea she was afraid to express such distress itwould bring with it</s>  well you know verena this isnt our reallifeit isnt our work olive went on</s> well no it isnt certainly said verena not pretending at firstthat she did not know what olive meant</s>  in a moment however she addeddo you refer to this social intercourse with mr</s>  burrage</s> not to that only</s>  then olive asked abruptly looking at her how didyou know his address</s> his address</s> mr</s>  ransomsto enable mrs</s>  burrage to invite him</s> they stood for a moment interchanging a gaze</s>  it was in a letter i gotfrom him</s> at these words there came into olives face an expression which made hercompanion cross over to her directly and take her by the hand</s>  but thetone was different from what verena expected when she said with coldsurprise oh you are in correspondence</s>  it showed an immense effortof selfcontrol</s> he wrote to me oncei never told you verena rejoined smiling</s>  shefelt that her friends strange uneasy eyes searched very far a littlemore and they would go to the very bottom</s>  well they might go if theywould she didnt after all care so much about her secret as that</s>  forthe moment however verena did not learn what olive had discoveredinasmuch as she only remarked presently that it was really time to godown</s>  as they descended the staircase she put her arm into misschancellors and perceived that she was trembling</s> of course there were plenty of people in new york interested in theuprising and olive had made appointments in advance which filled thewhole afternoon</s>  everybody wanted to meet them and wanted everybodyelse to do so and verena saw they could easily have quite a vogue ifthey only chose to stay and work that vein</s>  very likely as olive saidit wasnt their real life and people didnt seem to have such a grip ofthe movement as they had in boston but there was something in the airthat carried one along and a sense of vastness and variety of theinfinite possibilities of a great city whichverena hardly knewwhether she ought to confess it to herselfmight in the end make up forthe want of the boston earnestness</s>  certainly the people seemed verymuch alive and there was no other place where so many cheering reportscould flow in owing to the number of electric feelers that stretchedaway everywhere</s>  the principal centre appeared to be mrs</s>  crouchers onfiftysixth street where there was an informal gathering ofsympathisers who didnt seem as if they could forgive her when theylearned that she had been speaking the night before in a circle in whichnone of them were acquainted</s>  certainly they were very different fromthe group she had addressed at mrs</s>  burrages and verena heaved a thinprivate sigh expressive of some helplessness as she thought what abig complicated world it was and how it evidently contained a littleof everything</s>  there was a general demand that she should repeat heraddress in a more congenial atmosphere to which she replied that olivemade her engagements for her and that as the address had been intendedjust to lead people on perhaps she would think mrs</s>  crouchers friendshad reached a higher point</s>  she was as cautious as this because she sawthat olive was now just straining to get out of the city she didntwant to say anything that would tie them</s>  when she felt her tremblingthat way before luncheon it made her quite sick to realise how much herfriend was wrapped up in herhow terribly she would suffer from theleast deviation</s>  after they had started for their round of engagementsthe very first thing verena spoke of in the carriage olive had takenone in her liberal way for the whole time was the fact that hercorrespondence with mr</s>  ransom as her friend had called it hadconsisted on his part of only one letter</s>  it was a very short one tooit had come to her a little more than a month before</s>  olive knew she gotletters from gentlemen she didnt see why she should attach suchimportance to this one</s>  miss chancellor was leaning back in thecarriage very still very grave with her head against the cushionedsurface only turning her eyes towards the girl</s> you attach importance yourself otherwise you would have told me</s> i knew you wouldnt like itbecause you dont like him</s> i dont think of him said olive hes nothing to me</s>  then sheadded suddenly have you noticed that i am afraid to face what i dontlike</s> verena could not say that she had and yet it was not just on olivespart to speak as if she were an easy person to tell such a thing to theway she lay there white and weak like a wounded creature sufficientlyproved the contrary</s>  you have such a fearful power of suffering shereplied in a moment</s> to this at first miss chancellor made no rejoinder but after a littleshe said in the same attitude yes you could make me</s> verena took her hand and held it awhile</s>  i never will till i have beenthrough everything myself</s> you were not made to sufferyou were made to enjoy olive said invery much the same tone in which she had told her that what was thematter with her was that she didnt dislike men as a classa tone whichimplied that the contrary would have been much more natural and perhapsrather higher</s>  perhaps it would but verena was unable to rebut thecharge she felt this as she looked out of the window of the carriageat the bright amusing city where the elements seemed so numerous theanimation so immense the shops so brilliant the women so strikinglydressed and knew that these things quickened her curiosity all herpulses</s> well i suppose i mustnt presume on it she remarked glancing backat olive with her natural sweetness her uncontradicting grace</s> that young lady lifted her hand to her lipsheld it there a moment themovement seemed to say when you are so divinely docile how can i helpthe dread of losing you</s>  this idea however was unspoken and olivechancellors uttered words as the carriage rolled on were different</s> verena i dont understand why he wrote to you</s> he wrote to me because he likes me</s>  perhaps youll say you dontunderstand why he likes me the girl continued laughing</s>  he liked methe first time he saw me</s> oh that time</s>  olive murmured</s> and still more the second</s> did he tell you that in his letter</s>  miss chancellor inquired</s> yes my dear he told me that</s>  only he expressed it more gracefully</s> verena was very happy to say that a written phrase of basil ransomssufficiently justified her</s> it was my intuitionit was my foreboding</s>  olive exclaimed closingher eyes</s> i thought you said you didnt dislike him</s> it isnt dislikeits simple dread</s>  is that all there is between you</s> why olive chancellor what do you think</s>  verena asked feeling nowdistinctly like a coward</s>  five minutes afterwards she said to olive thatif it would give her pleasure they would leave new york on the morrowwithout taking a fourth day and as soon as she had done so she feltbetter especially when she saw how gratefully olive looked at her forthe concession how eagerly she rose to the offer in saying well ifyou do feel that it isnt our own lifeour very own</s>  it was withthese words and others besides and with an unusually weak indefinitekiss as if she wished to protest that after all a single day didntmatter and yet accepted the sacrifice and was a little ashamed ofitit was in this manner that the agreement as to an immediate retreatwas sealed</s>  verena could not shut her eyes to the fact that for a monthshe had been less frank and if she wished to do penance thisabbreviation of their pleasure in new york even if it made her almostcompletely miss basil ransom was easier than to tell olive just nowthat the letter was not all that there had been a long visit a talkand a walk besides which she had been covering up for ever so manyweeks</s>  and of what consequence anyway was the missing</s>  was it such apleasure to converse with a gentleman who only wanted to let youknowand why he should want it so much verena couldnt guessthat hethought you quite preposterous</s>  olive took her from place to place andshe ended by forgetting everything but the present hour and the bignessand variety of new york and the entertainment of rolling about in acarriage with silk cushions and meeting new faces new expressions ofcuriosity and sympathy assurances that one was watched and followed</s> mingled with this was a bright consciousness sufficient for the momentthat one was moreover to dine at delmonicos and go to the german opera</s> there was enough of the epicurean in verenas composition to make iteasy for her in certain conditions to live only for the hour</s> xxxiwhen she returned with her companion to the establishment in tenthstreet she saw two notes lying on the table in the hall one of whichshe perceived to be addressed to miss chancellor the other to herself</s> the hand was different but she recognised both</s>  olive was behind her onthe steps talking to the coachman about sending another carriage forthem in half an hour they had left themselves but just time to dressso that she simply possessed herself of her own note and ascended to herroom</s>  as she did so she felt that all the while she had known it wouldbe there and was conscious of a kind of treachery an unfriendlywilfulness in not being more prepared for it</s>  if she could roll aboutnew york the whole afternoon and forget that there might be difficultiesahead that didnt alter the fact that there were difficulties andthat they might even become considerablemight not be settled by hersimply going back to boston</s>  half an hour later as she drove up thefifth avenue with olive there seemed to be so much crowded into thatone day smoothing her light gloves wishing her fan were a littlenicer and proving by the answering familiar brightness with which shelooked out on the lamplighted streets that whatever theory might beentertained as to the genesis of her talent and her personal nature theblood of the lecturegoing nightwalking tarrants did distinctly flowin her veins as the pair proceeded i say to the celebratedrestaurant at the door of which mr</s>  burrage had promised to be invigilant expectancy of their carriage verena found a sufficiently gayand natural tone of voice for remarking to her friend that mr</s>  ransomhad called upon her while they were out and had left a note in whichthere were many compliments for miss chancellor</s> thats wholly your own affair my dear olive replied with amelancholy sigh gazing down the vista of fourteenth street which theyhappened just then to be traversing with much agitation toward thequeer barrier of the elevated railway</s> it was nothing new to verena that if the great striving of olives lifewas for justice she yet sometimes failed to arrive at it in particularcases and she reflected that it was rather late for her to say likethat that basil ransoms letters were only his correspondentsbusiness</s>  had not his kinswoman quite made the subject her own duringtheir drive that afternoon</s>  verena determined now that her companionshould hear all there was to be heard about the letter asking herselfwhether if she told her at present more than she cared to know itwouldnt make up for her hitherto having told her less</s>  he brought itwith him written in case i should be out</s>  he wants to see metomorrowhe says he has ever so much to say to me</s>  he proposes anhoursays he hopes it wont be inconvenient for me to see him abouteleven in the morning thinks i may have no other engagement so early asthat</s>  of course our return to boston settles it verena added withserenity</s> miss chancellor said nothing for a moment then she replied yesunless you invite him to come on with you in the train</s> why olive how bitter you are</s>  verena exclaimed in genuine surprise</s> olive could not justify her bitterness by saying that her companion hadspoken as if she were disappointed because verena had not</s>  so shesimply remarked i dont see what he can have to say to youthat wouldbe worth your hearing</s> well of course its the other side</s>  he has got it on the brain</s>  saidverena with a laugh which seemed to relegate the whole matter to thecategory of the unimportant</s> if we should stay would you see himat eleven oclock</s>  oliveinquired</s> why do you ask thatwhen i have given it up</s> do you consider it such a tremendous sacrifice</s> no said verena goodnaturedly but i confess i am curious</s>
well to hear the other side</s> oh heaven</s>  olive chancellor murmured turning her face upon her</s> you must remember i have never heard it</s>  and verena smiled into herfriends wan gaze</s> do you want to hear all the infamy that is in the world</s> no it isnt that but the more he should talk the better chance hewould give me</s>  i guess i can meet him</s> life is too short</s>  leave him as he is</s> well verena went on there are many i havent cared to move at allwhom i might have been more interested in than in him</s>  but to make himgive in just at two or three pointsthat i should like better thananything i have done</s> you have no business to enter upon a contest that isnt equal and itwouldnt be with mr</s>  ransom</s> the inequality would be that i have right on my side</s> what is thatfor a man</s>  for what was their brutality given them butto make that up</s> i dont think hes brutal i should like to see said verena gaily</s> olives eyes lingered a little on her own then they turned awayvaguely blindly out of the carriagewindow and verena made thereflexion that she looked strangely little like a person who was goingto dine at delmonicos</s>  how terribly she worried about everything andhow tragical was her nature how anxious suspicious exposed to subtleinfluences</s>  in their long intimacy verena had come to revere most of herfriends peculiarities they were a proof of her depth and devotion andwere so bound up with what was noble in her that she was rarely provokedto criticise them separately</s>  but at present suddenly olivesearnestness began to appear as inharmonious with the scheme of theuniverse as if it had been a broken saw and she was positively glad shehad not told her about basil ransoms appearance in monadnoc place</s>  ifshe worried so about what she knew how much would she not have worriedabout the rest</s>  verena had by this time made up her mind that heracquaintance with mr</s>  ransom was the most episodical most superficialmost unimportant of all possible relations</s> olive chancellor watched henry burrage very closely that evening shehad a special reason for doing so and her entertainment during thesuccessive hours was derived much less from the delicate little feastover which this insinuating proselyte presided in the brilliant publicroom of the establishment where french waiters flitted about on deepcarpets and parties at neighbouring tables excited curiosity andconjecture or even from the magnificent music of lohengrin than froma secret process of comparison and verification which shall presentlybe explained to the reader</s>  as some discredit has possibly been thrownupon her impartiality it is a pleasure to be able to say that on herreturn from the opera she took a step dictated by an earnestconsideration of justiceof the promptness with which verena had toldher of the note left by basil ransom in the afternoon</s>  she drew verenainto her room with her</s>  the girl on the way back to tenth street hadspoken only of wagners music of the singers the orchestra theimmensity of the house her tremendous pleasure</s>  olive could see howfond she might become of new york

verenas we was angelic</s>  he was particularlyattentive to you my dear he has got over me</s>  he looked at you sosweetly</s>  dearest olive if you marry him</s>  and miss tarrant who wasin high

did he tell you that pray</s>  he said nothing more about it to me</s> when we came in this afternoon i found this note from mrs</s>  burrage</s>  youhad better read it</s>  and she presented the document open to verena</s> the purpose of it was to say that mrs</s>  burrage could really notreconcile herself to the loss of verenas visit on which both she andher son had counted so much</s>  she was sure they would be able to make itas interesting to miss tarrant as it would be to themselves</s>  she mrs</s> burrage moreover felt as if she hadnt heard half she wanted aboutmiss tarrants views and there were so many more who were present atthe address who had come to her that afternoon losing not a minute asmiss chancellor could see to ask how in the world they too could learnmorehow they could get at the fair speaker and question her aboutcertain details</s>  she hoped so much therefore that even if the youngladies should be unable to alter their decision about the visit theymight at least see their way to staying over long enough to allow her toarrange an informal meeting for some of these poor thirsty souls</s>  mightshe not at least talk over the question with miss chancellor</s>  she gaveher notice that she would attack her on the subject of the visit too</s> might she not see her on the morrow and might she ask of her the verygreat favour that the interview should be at mrs</s>  burrages own house</s> she had something very particular to say to her as regards whichperfect privacy was a great consideration and miss chancellor woulddoubtless recognise that this would be best secured under mrs</s>  burragesroof</s>  she would therefore send her carriage for miss chancellor at anyhour that would be convenient to the latter</s>  she really thought muchgood might come from their having a satisfactory talk</s> verena read this epistle with much deliberation it seemed to hermysterious and confirmed the idea she had received the nightbeforethe idea that she had not got quite a correct impression of thisclever worldly curious woman on the occasion of her visit tocambridge when they met her at her sons rooms</s>  as she gave the letterback to olive she said thats why he didnt seem to believe we arereally leaving tomorrow</s>  he knows she had written that and he thinksit will keep us</s> well if i were to say it mayshould you think me too miserablychangeful</s> verena stared with all her candour and it was so very queer that oliveshould now wish to linger that the sense of it for the moment almostcovered the sense of its being pleasant</s>  but that came out after aninstant and she said with great honesty you neednt drag me away forconsistencys sake</s>  it would be absurd for me to pretend that i dontlike being here</s> i think perhaps i ought to see her</s>  olive was very thoughtful</s> how lovely it must be to have a secret with mrs</s>  burrage</s>  verenaexclaimed</s> it wont be a secret from you</s> dearest you neednt tell me unless you want verena went on thinkingof her own unimparted knowledge</s> i thought it was our plan to divide everything</s>  it was certainly mine</s> ah dont talk about plans</s>  verena exclaimed rather ruefully</s>  yousee if we are going to stay tomorrow how foolish it was to haveany</s>  there is more in her letter than is expressed she added as oliveappeared to be studying in her face the reasons for and against makingthis concession to mrs</s>  burrage and that was rather embarrassing</s> i thought it over all the eveningso that if now you will consent wewill stay</s> darlingwhat a spirit you have got</s>  all through all those dear littledishesall through lohengrin</s>  as i havent thought it over at allyou must settle it</s>  you know i am not difficult</s> and would you go and stay with mrs</s>  burrage after all if she shouldsay anything to me that seems to make it desirable</s> verena broke into a laugh</s>  you know its not our real life</s> olive said nothing for a moment then she replied dont think i canforget that</s>  if i suggest a deviation its only because it sometimesseems to me that perhaps after all almost anything is better than theform reality may take with us</s>  this was slightly obscure as well asvery melancholy and verena was relieved when her companion remarked ina moment you must think me strangely inconsequent for this gave hera chance to reply soothinglywhy you dont suppose i expect you to keep always screwed up</s>  i willstay a week with mrs</s>  burrage or a fortnight or a month or anythingyou like she pursued anything it may seem to you best to tell herafter you have seen her</s> do you leave it all to me</s>  you dont give me much help olive said</s> help to what</s> help to help you</s> i dont want any help i am quite strong enough</s>  verena cried gaily</s> the next moment she inquired in an appeal half comical half touchingmy dear colleague why do you make me say such conceited things</s> and if you do stayjust even tomorrowshall you bevery much of thetimewith mr</s>  ransom</s> as verena for the moment appeared ironicallyminded she might havefound a fresh subject for hilarity in the tremulous tentative tone inwhich olive made this inquiry</s>
 the colour rose to verenas cheek and her eye foran instant looked moist</s> i dont know what you always think olive nor why you dont seem ableto trust me</s>  you didnt from the first with gentlemen</s>  perhaps youwere right theni dont say but surely it is very different now</s>  idont think i ought to be suspected so much</s>  why have you a manner as ifi had to be watched as if i wanted to run away with every man thatspeaks to me</s>  i should think i had proved how little i care</s>  i thoughtyou had discovered by this time that i am serious that i have dedicatedmy life that

were to doour work in the midst of the world facing everything keeping straighton always taking hold</s>  and now that it all opens out so magnificentlyand victory is really sitting on our banners it is strange of you todoubt of me to suppose i am not more wedded to all our old dreams thanever</s>  i told you the first time i saw you that i could renounce andknowing better today perhaps what that means i am ready to say itagain</s>  that i can that i will</s>  why olive chancellor verena criedpanting a moment with her eloquence and with the rush of aculminating idea havent you discovered by this time that i haverenounced</s> the habit of public speaking the training the practice in which shehad been immersed enabled verena to unroll a coil of propositionsdedicated even to a private interest with the most touching mostcumulative effect</s>  olive was completely aware of this and she stilledherself while the girl uttered one soft pleading sentence afteranother into the same rapt attention she was in the habit of sending upfrom the benches of an auditorium</s>  she looked at verena fixedly feltthat she was stirred to her depths that she was exquisitely passionateand sincere that she was a quivering spotless consecrated maidenthat she really had renounced that they were both safe and that herown injustice and indelicacy had been great</s>  she came to her slowlytook her in her arms and held her longgiving her a silent kiss</s>  fromwhich verena knew that she believed her</s> xxxiithe hour that olive proposed to mrs</s>  burrage in a note sent early thenext morning for the interview to which she consented to lend herselfwas the stroke of noon this period of the day being chosen inconsequence of a prevision of many subsequent calls upon her time</s>  sheremarked in her note that she did not wish any carriage to be sent forher and she surged and swayed up the fifth avenue on one of theconvulsive clattering omnibuses which circulate in that thoroughfare</s> one of her reasons for mentioning twelve oclock had been that she knewbasil ransom was to call at tenth street at eleven and as she supposedhe didnt intend to stay all day this would give her time to see himcome and go</s>  it had been tacitly agreed between them the night beforethat verena was quite firm enough in her faith to submit to his visitand that such a course would be much more dignified than dodging it</s> this understanding passed from one to the other during that dumb embracewhich i have described as taking place before they separated for thenight</s>  shortly before noon olive passing out of the house looked intothe big sunny double parlour where in the morning with all thehusbands absent for the day and all the wives and spinsters launchedupon the town a young man desiring to hold a debate with a young ladymight enjoy every advantage in the way of a clear field</s>  basil ransomwas still there he and verena with the place to themselves werestanding in the recess of a window their backs presented to the door</s> if he had got up perhaps he was going and olive softly closing thedoor again waited a little in the hall ready to pass into the backpart of the house if she should hear him coming out</s>  no sound howeverreached her ear apparently he did mean to stay all day and she shouldfind him there on her return</s>  she left the house knowing they werelooking at her from the window as she descended the steps but feelingshe could not bear to see basil ransoms face</s>  as she walked avertingher own towards the fifth avenue on the sunny side she was barelyconscious of the loveliness of the day the perfect weather allsuffused and tinted with spring which sometimes descends upon new yorkwhen the winds of march have been stilled she was given up only to theremembrance of that moment when she herself had stood at a window thesecond time he came to see her in boston and watched basil ransom passout with adelinewith adeline who had seemed capable then of gettingsuch a hold on him but had proved as ineffectual in this respect as shewas in every other</s>  she recalled the vision she had allowed to dancebefore her as she saw the pair cross the street together laughing andtalking and how it seemed to interpose itself against the fears whichalready thenso strangelyhaunted her</s>  now that she saw it sofruitlessand that verena moreover had turned out really sogreatshe was rather ashamed of it she felt associated howeverremotely in the reasons which had made mrs</s>  luna tell her so many fibsthe day before and there could be nothing elevating in that</s>  as for theother reasons why her fidgety sister had failed and mr</s>  ransom had heldhis own course naturally miss chancellor didnt like to think of them</s> if she had wondered what mrs</s>  burrage wished so particularly to talkabout she waited some time for the clearingup of the mystery</s>  duringthis interval she sat in a remarkably pretty boudoir where there wereflowers and faiences and little french pictures and watched her hostessrevolve round the subject in circles the vagueness of which she tried todissimulate</s>  olive believed she was a person who never could enjoyasking a favour especially of a votary of the new ideas and that wasevidently what was coming</s>  she had asked one already but that had beenhandsomely paid for the note from mrs</s>  burrage which verena foundawaiting her in tenth street on her arrival contained the largestcheque this young woman had ever received for an address</s>  the requestthat hung fire had reference to verena too of course and olive neededno prompting to feel that her friends being a young person who tookmoney could not make mrs</s>  burrages present effort more agreeable</s>  tothis taking of money for when it came to verena it was as if it came toher as well she herself was now completely inured money was atremendous force and when one wanted to assault the wrong with everyengine one was happy not to lack the sinews of war</s>  she liked herhostess better this morning than she had liked her before she had morethan ever the air of taking all sorts of sentiments and views forgranted between them which could only be flattering to olive so long asit was really mrs</s>  burrage who made each advance while her visitor satwatchful and motionless</s>  she had a light clever familiar way oftraversing an immense distance with a very few words as when sheremarked well then it is settled that she will come and will staytill she is tired</s> nothing of the kind had been settled but olive helped mrs</s>  burragethis time more than she knew by saying why do you want her to visityou mrs</s>  burrage</s>  why do you want her socially</s>  are you not aware thatyour son a year ago desired to marry her</s> my dear miss chancellor that is just what i wish to talk to you about</s> i am aware of everything i dont believe you ever met any one who isaware of more things than i</s>  and olive had to believe this as mrs</s> burrage held up smiling her intelligent proud goodnaturedsuccessful head</s>  i knew a year ago that my son was in love with yourfriend i know that he has been so ever since and that in consequencehe would like to marry her today</s>  i daresay you dont like the idea ofher marrying at all it would break up a friendship which is so full ofinterest olive wondered for a moment whether she had been going to sayso full of profit for you</s>  this is why i hesitated but since youare willing to talk about it that is just what i want</s> i dont see what good it will do olive said</s> how can we tell till we try</s>  i never give a thing up till i have turnedit over in every sense</s> it was mrs</s>  burrage however who did most of the talking olive onlyinserted from time to time an inquiry a protest a correction anejaculation tinged with irony</s>  none of these things checked or divertedher hostess olive saw more and more that she wished to please her towin her over to smooth matters down to place them in a new andoriginal light</s>  she was very clever and little by little olive said toherself absolutely unscrupulous but she didnt think she was cleverenough for what she had undertaken</s>  this was neither more nor less inthe first place than to persuade miss chancellor that she and her sonwere consumed with sympathy for the movement to which miss chancellorhad dedicated her life</s>  but how could olive believe that when she sawthe type to which mrs</s>  burrage belongeda type into which natureherself had inserted a face turned in the very opposite way from allearnest and improving things</s>  people like mrs</s>  burrage lived andfattened on abuses prejudices privileges on the petrified cruelfashions of the past</s>  it must be added however that if her hostess wasa humbug olive had never met one who provoked her less she was such abrilliant genial artistic one with such a recklessness of perfidysuch a willingness to bribe you if she couldnt deceive you</s>  she seemedto be offering olive all the kingdoms of the earth if she would onlyexert herself to bring about a state of feeling on verena tarrants partwhich would lead the girl to accept henry burrage</s> we know its youthe whole business that you can do what you please</s> you could decide it tomorrow with a word</s> she had hesitated at first and spoken of her hesitation and it mighthave appeared that she would need all her courage to say to olive thatway face to face that verena was in such subjection to her</s>  but shedidnt look afraid she only looked as if it were an infinite pity misschancellor couldnt understand what immense advantages and rewards therewould be for her in striking an alliance with the house of burrage</s> olive was so impressed with this so occupied even in wondering whatthese mystic benefits might be and whether after all there might not bea protection in them from something worse a fund of some sort thatshe and verena might convert to a large use setting aside the motherand son when once they had got what they had to giveshe was soarrested with the vague daze of this vision the sense of mrs</s>  burragesfull hands her eagerness her thinking it worth while to flatter andconciliate whatever her pretexts and pretensions might be that she wasalmost insensible for the time to the strangeness of such a womanscoming round to a positive desire for a connexion with the tarrants</s> mrs</s>  burrage had indeed explained this partly by saying that her sonscondition was wearing her out and that she would enter into anythingthat would make him happier make him better</s>  she was fonder of him thanof the whole world beside and it was an anguish to her to see himyearning for miss tarrant only to lose her</s>  she made that charge aboutolives power in the matter in such a way that it seemed at the sametime a tribute to her force of character</s> i dont know on what terms you suppose me to be with my friend olivereturned with considerable majesty</s>  she will do exactly as she likesin such a case as the one you allude to</s>  she is absolutely free youspeak as if i were her keeper</s> then mrs</s>  burrage explained that of course she didnt mean that misschancellor exercised a conscious tyranny but only that verena had aboundless admiration for her saw through her eyes took the impress ofall her opinions preferences</s>  she was sure that if olive would onlytake a favourable view of her son miss tarrant would instantly throwherself into it</s>  its very true that you may ask me added mrs</s> burrage smiling how you can take a favourable view of a young man whowants to marry the very person in the world you want most to keepunmarried</s> this description of verena was of course perfectly correct but it wasnot agreeable to olive to have the fact in question so clearlyperceived even by a person who expressed it with an air intimating thatthere was nothing in the world she couldnt understand</s> did your son know that you were going to speak to me about this</s>  oliveasked rather coldly waiving the question of her influence on verenaand the state in which she wished her to remain</s> oh yes poor dear boy we had a long talk yesterday and i told him iwould do what i could for him</s>  do you remember the little visit i paidto cambridge last spring when i saw you at his rooms</s>  then it was ibegan to perceive how the wind was setting but yesterday we had a realclaircissement</s>  i didnt like it at all at first i dont mindtelling you that nownow that i am really enthusiastic about it</s>  whena girl is as charming as original as miss tarrant it doesnt in theleast matter who she is she makes herself the standard by which youmeasure her she makes her own position</s>  and then miss tarrant has sucha future</s>  mrs</s>  burrage added quickly as if that were the last thingto be overlooked</s>  the whole question has come up againthe feelingthat henry tried to think dead or at least dying has revived throughthei hardly know what to call it but i really may say theunexpectedly great effect of her appearance here</s>  she was reallywonderful on wednesday evening prejudice conventionality everypresumption there might be against her had to fall to the ground</s>  iexpected a success but i didnt expect what you gave us mrs</s>  burragewent on smiling while olive noted her you</s>  in short my poor boyflamed up again and now i see that he will never again care for anygirl as he cares for that one</s>  my dear miss chancellor jen ai prismon parti and perhaps you know my way of doing that sort of thing</s>  iam not at all good at resigning myself but i am excellent at taking upa craze</s>  i havent renounced i have only changed sides</s>  for or againsti must be a partisan</s>  dont you know that kind of nature</s>  henry has putthe affair into my hands and you see i put it into yours</s>  do help melet us work together</s> this was a long explicit speech for mrs</s>  burrage who dealt usuallyin the cursory and allusive and she may very well have expected thatmiss chancellor would recognise its importance</s>  what olive did in factwas simply to inquire by way of rejoinder why did you ask us to comeon</s> if mrs</s>  burrage hesitated now it was only for twenty seconds</s>  simplybecause we are so interested in your work</s> that surprises me said olive thoughtfully</s> i daresay you dont believe it but such a judgement is superficial</s>  iam sure we give proof in the offer we make mrs</s>  burrage remarked witha good deal of point</s>  there are plenty of girlswithout any views atallwho would be delighted to marry my son</s>  he is very clever and hehas a large fortune</s>  add to that that hes an angel</s> that was very true and olive felt all the more that the attitude ofthese fortunate people for whom the world was so well arranged just asit was was very curious</s>  but as she sat there it came over her that thehuman spirit has many variations that the influence of the truth isgreat and that there are such things in life as happy surprises quiteas well as disagreeable ones</s>  nothing certainly forced such people tofix their affections on the daughter of a healer it would be veryclumsy to pick her out of her generation only for the purpose offrustrating her</s>  moreover her observation of their young host atdelmonicos and in the spacious box at the academy of music where theyhad privacy and ease and murmured words could pass without makingneighbours more given up to the stage turn their headsherconsideration of henry burrages manner suggested to her that she hadmeasured him rather scantily the year before that he was as much inlove as the feebler passions of the age permitted for though misschancellor believed in the amelioration of humanity she thought therewas too much water in the blood of all of us that he prized verena forher rarity which was her genius her gift and would therefore have aninterest in promoting it and that he was of so soft and fine a pastethat his wife might do what she liked with him</s>  of course there would bethe motherinlaw to count with but unless she was perjuring herselfshamelessly mrs</s>  burrage really had the wish to project herself into thenew atmosphere or at least to be generous personally so that oddlyenough the fear that most glanced before olive was not that this highfree matron slightly irritable with cleverness and at the same timegoodnatured with prosperity would bully her sons bride but ratherthat she might take too fond a possession of her</s>  it was a fear whichmay be described as a presentiment of jealousy</s>  it occurredaccordingly to miss chancellors quick conscience that possibly theproposal which presented itself in circumstances so complicated andanomalous was simply a magnificent chance an improvement on the verybest even that she had dreamed of for verena</s>  it meant a large commandof moneymuch larger than her own the association of a couple ofclever people who simulated conviction very well whether they felt itor not and who had a hundred useful worldly ramifications and a kindof social pedestal from which she might really shine afar</s>  theconscience i have spoken of grew positively sick as it thought of havingsuch a problem as that to consider such an ordeal to traverse</s>  in thepresence of such a contingency the poor girl felt grim and helpless shecould only vaguely wonder whether she were called upon in the name ofduty to lend a hand to the torture of her own spirit</s> and if she should marry him how could i be sure thatafterwardsyouwould care so much about the question which has all our thoughts hersand mine</s>  this inquiry evolved itself from olives rapid meditationbut even to herself it seemed a little rough</s> mrs</s>  burrage took it admirably</s>  you think we are feigning an interestonly to get hold of her</s>  thats not very nice of you miss chancellorbut of course you have to be tremendously careful</s>  i assure you my sontells me he firmly believes your movement is the great question of theimmediate future that it has entered into a new phase into what doeshe call it</s>  the domain of practical politics</s>  as for me you dontsuppose i dont want everything we poor women can get or that i wouldrefuse any privilege or advantage thats offered me</s>  i dont rant orrave about anything but i haveas i told you just nowmy own quietway of being zealous</s>  if you had no worse partisan than i you would dovery well</s>  my son has talked to me immensely about your ideas and evenif i should enter into them only because he does i should do so quiteenough</s>  you may say you dont see henry dangling about after a wife whogives public addresses but i am convinced that a great many things arecoming to passvery soon toothat we dont see in advance</s>  henry is agentleman to his fingertips and there is not a situation in which hewill not conduct himself with tact</s> olive could see that they really wanted verena immensely and it wasimpossible for her to believe that if they were to get her they wouldnot treat her well</s>  it came to her that they would even overindulge herflatter her spoil her she was perfectly capable for the moment ofassuming that verena was susceptible of deterioration and that her owntreatment of her had been discriminatingly severe</s>  she had a hundredprotests objections replies her only embarrassment could be as towhich she should use first</s> i think you have never seen doctor tarrant and his wife she remarkedwith a calmness which she felt to be very pregnant</s>
 my son has told me they are quiteimpossible and i am quite prepared for that</s>  do you ask how we shouldget on with them</s>  my dear young lady we should get on as you do</s> if olive had answers so had mrs</s>  burrage she had still an answer whenher visitor taking up the supposition that it was in her power todispose in any manner whatsoever of verena declared that she didntknow why mrs</s>  burrage addressed herself to her that miss tarrant wasfree as air that her future was in her own hands that such a matter asthis was a kind of thing with which it could never occur to one tointerfere</s>  dear miss chancellor we dont ask you to interfere</s>  theonly thing we ask of you is simply not to interfere</s> and have you sent for me only for that</s> for that and for what i hinted at in my note that you would reallyexercise your influence with miss tarrant to induce her to come to usnow for a week or two</s>  that is really after all the main thing i ask</s> lend her to us here for a little while and we will take care of therest</s>  that sounds conceitedbut she would have a good time</s> she doesnt live for that said olive</s> what i mean is that she should deliver an address every night</s>  mrs</s> burrage returned smiling</s> i think you try to prove too much</s>  you do believethough you pretendyou dontthat i control her actions and as far as possible herdesires and that i am jealous of any other relations she may possiblyform</s>  i can imagine that we may perhaps have that air though it onlyproves how little such an association as ours is understood and howsuperficial is stillolive felt that her still was reallyhistoricalthe interpretation of many of the elements in the activityof women how much the public conscience with regard to them needs to beeducated</s>  your conviction with respect to my attitude being what ibelieve it to be miss chancellor went on i am surprised at your notperceiving how little it is in my interest to deliver mymy victim upto you</s> if we were at this moment to take in a single glance an inside view ofmrs</s>  burrage a liberty we have not yet ventured on i suspect weshould find that she was considerably exasperated at her visitorssuperior tone at seeing herself regarded by this dry shy obstinateprovincial young woman as superficial</s>  if she liked verena very nearlyas much as she tried to convince miss chancellor she was conscious ofdisliking miss chancellor more than she should probably ever be able toreveal to verena</s>  it was doubtless partly her irritation that found avoice as she said after a selfadministered pinch of caution not to saytoo much of course it would be absurd in us to assume that misstarrant would find my son irresistible especially as she has alreadyrefused him</s>  but even if she should remain obdurate should you consideryourself quite safe as regards others</s> the manner in which miss chancellor rose from her chair on hearing thesewords showed her hostess that if she had wished to take a little revengeby frightening her the experiment was successful</s>  what others do youmean</s>  olive asked standing very straight and turning down her eyes asfrom a great height</s> mrs</s>  burragesince we have begun to look into her mind we may continuethe processhad not meant any one in particular but a train ofassociation was suddenly kindled in her thought by the flash of thegirls resentment</s>  she remembered the gentleman who had come up to herin the musicroom after miss tarrants address while she was talkingwith olive and to whom that young lady had given so cold a welcome</s>  idont mean any one in particular but for instance there is the youngman to whom she asked me to send an invitation to my party and wholooked to me like a possible admirer</s>  mrs</s>  burrage also got up thenshe stood a moment closer to her visitor</s>  dont you think its a gooddeal to expect that young pretty attractive clever charming as sheis you should be able to keep her always to exclude other affectionsto cut off a whole side of life to defend her against dangersif youcall them dangersto which every young woman who is not positivelyrepulsive is exposed</s>  my dear young lady i wonder if i might give youthree words of advice</s>  mrs</s>  burrage did not wait till olive hadanswered this inquiry she went on quickly with her air of knowingexactly what she wanted to say and feeling at the same time that goodas it might be the manner of saying it like the manner of saying mostother things was not worth troubling much about</s>  dont attempt theimpossible</s>  you have got hold of a good thing dont spoil it by tryingto stretch it too far</s>  if you dont take the better perhaps you willhave to take the worse if its safety you want i should think she wasmuch safer with my sonfor with us you know the worstthan as apossible prey to adventurers to exploiters or to people who once theyhad got hold of her would shut her up altogether</s> olive dropped her eyes she couldnt endure mrs</s>  burrages horribleexpression of being near the mark her look of worldly cleverness of aconfidence born of much experience</s>  she felt that nothing would bespared her that she should have to go to the end that this ordeal alsomust be faced and that in particular there was a detestable wisdom inher hostesss advice</s>  she was conscious however of no obligation torecognise it then and there she wanted to get off and even to carrymrs</s>  burrages sapient words along with herto hurry to some placewhere she might be alone and think</s>  i dont know why you have thoughtit right to send for me only to say this</s>  i take no interest whatever inyour sonin his settling in life</s>  and she gathered her mantle moreclosely about her turning away</s> it is exceedingly kind of you to have come said mrs</s>  burrageimperturbably</s>  think of what i have said i am sure you wont feel thatyou have wasted your hour</s> i have a great many things to think of</s>  olive exclaimed insincerelyfor she knew that mrs</s>  burrages ideas would haunt her</s> and tell her that if she will make us the little visit all new yorkshall sit at her feet</s> that was what olive wanted and yet it seemed a mockery to hear mrs</s> burrage say it</s>  miss chancellor retreated making no response even whenher hostess declared again that she was under great obligations to herfor coming</s>  when she reached the street she found she was deeplyagitated but not with a sense of weakness she hurried along excitedand dismayed feeling that her insufferable conscience was bristlinglike some irritated animal that a magnificent offer had really beenmade to verena and that there was no way for her to persuade herselfshe might be silent about it</s>  of course if verena should be tempted bythe idea of being made so much of by the burrages the danger of basilransom getting any kind of hold on her would cease to be pressing</s>  thatwas what was present to olive as she walked along and that was whatmade her nervous conscious only of this problem that had suddenlyturned the bright day to greyness heedless of the sophisticatedlookingpeople who passed her on the wide fifth avenue pavement</s>  it had risen inher mind the day before planted first by mrs</s>  burrages note and thenas we know she had vaguely entertained the conception asking verenawhether she would make the visit if it were again to be pressed uponthem</s>  it had been pressed certainly and the terms of the problem werenow so much sharper that they seemed cruel</s>  what had been in her ownmind was that if verena should appear to lend herself to the burragesbasil ransom might be discouragedmight think that shabby and poorthere was no chance for him as against people with every advantage offortune and position</s>  she didnt see him relax his purpose so easilyshe knew she didnt believe he was of that pusillanimous fibre</s>  stillit was a chance and any chance that might help her had been worthconsidering</s>  at present she saw it was a question not of verenaslending herself but of a positive gift or at least of a bargain inwhich the terms would be immensely liberal</s>  it would be impossible touse the burrages as a shelter on the assumption that they were notdangerous for they became dangerous from the moment they set up assympathisers took the ground that what they offered the girl was simplya boundless opportunity</s>  it came back to olive again and again thatthis was and could only be fantastic and false but it was alwayspossible that verena might not think it so might trust them all theway</s>  when miss chancellor had a pair of alternatives to consider aquestion of duty to study she put a kind of passion into itfeltabove all that the matter must be settled that very hour beforeanything in life could go on</s>  it seemed to her at present that shecouldnt reenter the house in tenth street without having decided firstwhether she might trust the burrages or not</s>  by trust them she meanttrust them to fail in winning verena over while at the same time theyput basil ransom on a false scent</s>  olive was able to say to herself thathe probably wouldnt have the hardihood to push after her into thosegilded saloons which in any event would be closed to him as soon asthe mother and son should discover what he wanted</s>  she even askedherself whether verena would not be still better defended from the youngsoutherner in new york amid complicated hospitalities than in bostonwith a cousin of the enemy</s>  she continued to walk down the fifth avenuewithout noticing the crossstreets and after a while became consciousthat she was approaching washington square</s>  by this time she had alsodefinitely reasoned it out that basil ransom and henry burrage could notboth capture miss tarrant that therefore there could not be twodangers but only one that this was a good deal gained and that itbehoved her to determine which peril had most reality in order that shemight deal with that one only</s>  she held her way to the square which asall the world knows is of great extent and open to the encirclingstreet</s>  the trees and grassplats had begun to bud and sprout thefountains plashed in the sunshine the children of the quarter both thedingier types from the south side who played games that required muchchalking of the paved walks and much sprawling and crouching thereunder the feet of passers and the little curled and feathered peoplewho drove their hoops under the eyes of french nursemaidsall theinfant population filled the vernal air with small sounds which had acrude tender quality like the leaves and the thin herbage</s>  olivewandered through the place and ended by sitting down on one of thecontinuous benches</s>  it was a long time since she had done anything sovague so wasteful</s>  there were a dozen things which as she was stayingover in new york she ought to do but she forgot them or if shethought of them felt that they were now of no moment</s>  she remained inher place an hour brooding tremulous turning over and over certainthoughts</s>  it seemed to her that she was

for her to stroll with him round cambridgewhere she knew every step and had the confidence and freedom which camefrom being on her own ground and the pretext which was perfectlynatural of wanting to show him the colleges and quite another thing togo wandering with him through the streets of this great strange citywhich attractive delightful as it was had not the suitableness evenof being his home

determined toproduce some effect on him but now suddenly she felt differentlyabout thatshe ceased to care whether she produced any effect or not</s> she didnt see why she should take him so seriously when he wouldnttake her so that is wouldnt take her ideas</s>  she had guessed beforethat he didnt want to discuss them this had been in her mind when shesaid to him at cambridge that his interest in her was personal notcontroversial</s>  then she had simply meant that as an inquiring youngsoutherner he had wanted to see what a bright new england girl waslike but since then it had become a little more clear to herher shorttalk with ransom at mrs</s>  burrages threw some light upon thequestionwhat the personal interest of a young southerner howeverinquiring merely might amount to</s>  did he too want to make love to her</s> this idea made verena rather impatient weary in advance</s>  the thing shedesired least in the world was to be put into the wrong with olive forshe had certainly given her ground to believe not only in their scenethe night before which was a simple repetition but all along from thevery first that she really had an interest which would transcend anyattraction coming from such a source as that</s>  if yesterday it seemed toher that she should like to struggle with mr</s>  ransom to refute andconvince him she had this morning gone into the parlour to receive himwith the idea that now they were alone together in a quiet favourableplace he would perhaps take up the different points of her address oneby one as several gentlemen had done after hearing her on otheroccasions</s>  there was nothing she liked so well as that and olive neverhad anything to say against it</s>  but he hadnt taken up anything he hadsimply laughed and chaffed and unrolled a string of queer fancies aboutthe delightful way women would fix things when as she said in heraddress they should get out of their box</s>  he kept talking about thebox he seemed as if he wouldnt let go that simile</s>  he said that he hadcome to look at her through the glass sides and if he wasnt afraid ofhurting her he would smash them in</s>  he was determined to find the keythat would open it if he

pathetic should speakrough derisive words about it</s>  ransom in truth today was notdisposed to be very scrupulous and he only wanted to get rid of olivechancellor whose image at last decidedly bothered and bored him</s>  hewas glad to see her go out but that was not sufficient she would comeback quick enough the place itself contained her expressed her</s>  fortoday he wanted to take possession of verena to carry her to adistance to reproduce a little the happy conditions they had enjoyedthe day of his visit to cambridge</s>  and the fact that in the nature ofthings it could only be for today made his desire more keen more fullof purpose</s>  he had thought over the whole question in the lastfortyeight hours and it was his belief that he saw things in theirabsolute reality</s>

keep her in affluence for evermore</s>  ishall perhaps expose our young man to the contempt of superior minds ifi say that all this seemed to him an insuperable impediment to hismaking up to verena</s>  his scruples were doubtless begotten of a falsepride a sentiment in which there was a thread of moral tinsel as therewas in the southern idea of chivalry but he felt ashamed of his

what a mean businessit was to practise upon human imbecility how much better it was even tobe seedy and obscure discouraged about ones self</s>  he had been born tothe prospect of a fortune and in spite of the years of misery thatfollowed the war had never rid himself of the belief that a gentlemanwho desired to unite himself to a charming girl couldnt yet ask her tocome and live with him in sordid conditions</s>  on the other hand it was nopossible basis of matrimony that verena should continue for hisadvantage the exercise of her remunerative profession if he shouldbecome her husband he

addedsophistically it isnt proper for me to pay a visit of three hours</s> verena did not take up the sophistry nor ask him whether it would bemore proper for her to ramble about the city with him for

after having threaded the deviousways of the ramble lost themselves in the maze and admired all thestatues and busts of great men with which the grounds are decoratedthey contented themselves with

well said doctor prance with a small sigh i am afraid i have movedback if anything</s>  her sigh told him a good deal it seemed a thinselfcontrolled protest against the tone of miss chancellors interiorof which it was her present fortune to form a part and the way shehovered round indistinct in the gloom as if she were rather loath toresume her place there completed his impression that the littledoctress had a line of her own</s> that at least must distress miss birdseye he said reproachfully</s> not much because i am not of importance</s>  they think women the equalsof men but they are a great deal more pleased when a man joins thanwhen a woman does</s> ransom complimented doctor prance on the lucidity of her mind and thenhe said is miss birdseye really sick</s>  is her condition veryprecarious</s> well she is very old and veryvery gentle doctor prance answeredhesitating a moment for her adjective</s>  under those circumstances aperson may flicker out</s> we must trim the lamp said ransom i will take my turn withpleasure in watching the sacred flame</s> it will be a pity if she doesnt live to hear miss tarrants greateffort his companion went on</s> miss tarrants</s>  whats that</s> well its the principal interest in there</s>  and doctor prance nowvaguely indicated with a movement of her head a small white housemuch detached from its neighbours which stood on their left with itsback to the water at a little distance from the road</s>  it exhibited moresigns of animation than any of its fellows several windows notablythose of the ground floor were open to the warm evening and a largeshaft of light was projected upon the grassy wayside in front of it</s> ransom in his determination to be discreet checked the advance of hiscompanion who added presently with a short suppressed laughyou cansee it is from that</s>  he listened to ascertain what she meant andafter an instant a sound came to his eara sound he knew already wellwhich carried the accents of verena tarrant in ample periods andcadences out into the stillness of the august night</s> murder what a lovely voice</s>  he exclaimed involuntarily</s> doctor prances eye gleamed towards him a moment and she observedhumorously she was relaxing immensely perhaps miss birdseye isright</s>  then as he made no rejoinder only listening to the vocalinflexions that floated out of the house she went onshes practisingher speech</s> her speech</s>  is she going to deliver one here</s> no as soon as they go back to townat the music hall</s> ransoms attention was now transferred to his companion</s>  is that whyyou call it her great effort</s> well so they think it i believe</s>  she practises that way every nightshe reads portions of it aloud to miss chancellor and miss birdseye</s> and thats the time you choose for your walk</s>  ransom said smiling</s> well its the time my old lady has least need of me shes tooabsorbed</s> doctor prance dealt in facts ransom had already discovered that andsome of her facts were very interesting</s> the music hallisnt that your great building</s>  he asked</s> well its the biggest weve got its pretty big but it isnt so bigas miss chancellors ideas added doctor prance</s>  she has taken it tobring out miss tarrant before the general publicshe has never appearedthat way in bostonon a great scale</s>  she expects her to make a bigsensation</s>  it will be a great night and they are preparing for it</s>  theyconsider it her real beginning</s> and this is the preparation</s>  basil ransom said</s> yes as i say its their principal interest</s> ransom listened and while he listened he meditated</s>  he had thought itpossible verenas principles might have been shaken by the profession offaith to which he treated her in new york but this hardly looked likeit</s>  for some moments doctor prance and he stood together in silence</s> you dont hear the words the doctor remarked with a smile which inthe dark looked mephistophelean</s> oh i know the words</s>  the young man exclaimed with rather a groan ashe offered her his hand for goodnight</s> xxxvia certain prudence had determined him to put off his visit till themorning he thought it more probable that at that time he should be ableto see verena alone whereas in the evening the two young women would besure to be sitting together</s>  when the morrow dawned however basilransom felt none of the trepidation of the procrastinator he knewnothing of the reception that awaited him but he took his way to thecottage designated to him overnight by doctor prance with the step ofa man much more conscious of his own purpose than of possible obstacles</s> he made the reflexion as he went that to see a place for the firsttime at night is like reading a foreign author in a translation</s>  at thepresent hourit was getting towards eleven oclockhe felt that he wasdealing with the original</s>
 the little straggling looselyclustered townlay along the edge of a blue inlet on the other side of which was alow wooded shore with a gleam of white sand where it touched thewater</s>  the narrow bay carried the vision outward to a picture thatseemed at once bright and dima shining slumbering summer sea and afaroff circling line of coast which under the august sun was hazyand delicate</s>
 ransom regarded the place as a town because doctor prancehad called it one but it was a town where you smelt the breath of thehay in the streets and you might gather blackberries in the principalsquare</s>  the houses looked at each other across the grasslow rustycrooked distended houses with dry cracked faces and the dim eyes ofsmallpaned stifflysliding windows</s>  their little dooryards bristledwith rank oldfashioned flowers mostly yellow and on the quarter thatstood back from the sea the fields sloped upward and the woods in whichthey presently lost themselves looked down over the roofs</s>  bolts andbars were not a part of the domestic machinery of marmion and theresponsive menial receiving the visitor on the threshold was acreature rather desired than definitely possessed so that basil ransomfound miss chancellors housedoor gaping wide as he had seen it thenight before and destitute even of a knocker or a bellhandle</s>  fromwhere he stood in the porch he could see the whole of the littlesittingroom on the left of the hallsee that it stretched straightthrough to the back windows that it was garnished with photographs offoreign works of art pinned upon the walls and enriched with a pianoand other little extemporised embellishments such as ingenious womenlavish upon the houses they hire for a few weeks</s>  verena told himafterwards that olive had taken her cottage furnished but that thepaucity of chairs and tables and bedsteads was such that their littleparty used almost to sit down to lie down in turn</s>  on the other handthey had all george eliots writings and two photographs of the sistinemadonna</s>  ransom rapped with his stick on the lintel of the door but noone came to receive him so he made his way into the parlour where heobserved that his cousin olive had as many german books as ever lyingabout</s>  he dipped into this literature momentarily according to hiswont and then remembered that this was not what he had come for andthat as he waited at the door he had seen through another door openingat the opposite end of the hall signs of a small verandah attached tothe other face of the house</s>  thinking the ladies might be assembledthere in the shade he pushed aside the muslin curtain of the backwindow and saw that the advantages of miss chancellors summerresidence were in this quarter</s>  there was a verandah in fact to whicha wide horizontal trellis covered with an ancient vine formed a kindof extension</s>  beyond the trellis was a small lonely garden beyond thegarden was a large vague woody space where a few piles of old timberwere disposed and which he afterwards learned to be a relic of theshipbuilding era described to him by doctor prance and still beyondthis again was the charming lakelike estuary he had already admired</s> his eyes did not rest upon the distance they were attracted by a figureseated under the trellis where the chequers of sun in the intersticesof the vine leaves fell upon a brightcoloured rug spread out on theground</s>  the floor of the roughlyconstructed verandah was so low thatthere was virtually no difference in the level</s>  it took ransom only amoment to recognise miss birdseye though her back was turned to thehouse</s>  she was alone she sat there motionless she had a newspaper inher lap but her attitude was not that of a reader looking at theshimmering bay</s>  she might be asleep that was why ransom moderated theprocess of his long legs as he came round through the house to join her</s> this precaution represented his only scruple</s>  he stepped across theverandah and stood close to her but she did not appear to notice him</s> visibly she was dozing or presumably rather for her head wasenveloped in an old faded straw hat which concealed the upper part ofher face</s>  there were two or three other chairs near her and a table onwhich were halfadozen books and periodicals together with a glasscontaining a colourless liquid on the top of which a spoon was laid</s> ransom desired only to respect her repose so he sat down in one of thechairs and waited till she should become aware of his presence</s>  hethought miss chancellors backgarden a delightful spot and his jadedsenses tasted the breezethe idle wandering summer windthat stirredthe vine leaves over his head</s>  the hazy shores on the other side of thewater which had tints more delicate than the street vistas of new yorkthey seemed powdered with silver a sort of midsummer light suggestedto him a land of dreams a country in a picture</s>  basil ransom had seenvery few pictures there were none in mississippi but he had a visionat times of something that would be more refined than the real worldand the situation in which he now found himself pleased him almost asmuch as if it had been a striking work of art</s>  he was unable to see asi have said whether miss birdseye were taking in the prospect throughopen or only imagination aiding she had plenty of that throughclosed tired dazzled eyes</s>  she appeared to him as the minutes elapsedand he sat beside her the incarnation of wellearned rest of patientsubmissive superannuation</s>  at the end of her long days work she mighthave been placed there to enjoy this dim prevision of the peacefulriver the gleaming shores of the paradise her unselfish life hadcertainly qualified her to enter and which apparently would so soonbe opened to her</s>  after a while she said placidly without turningi suppose its about time i should take my remedy again</s>  it does seemas if she had found the right thing dont you think so</s>
 i shall be delighted to giveit to you and you must tell me how much you take</s>  and basil ransomgetting up possessed himself of the glass on the table</s> at the sound of his voice miss birdseye pushed back her straw hat by amovement that was familiar to her and twisting about her muffled figurea little even in august she felt the cold and had to be much coveredup to sit out directed at him a speculative unastonished gaze</s> one spoonfultwo</s>  ransom asked stirring the dose and smiling</s> well i guess ill take two this time</s> certainly doctor prance couldnt help finding the right thing ransomsaid as he administered the medicine while the movement with which sheextended her face to take it made her seem doubly childlike</s> he put down the glass and she relapsed into her position she seemed tobe considering</s>  its homeopathic she remarked in a moment</s> oh i have no doubt of that i presume you wouldnt take anythingelse</s> well its generally admitted now to be the true system</s> ransom moved closer to her placed himself where she could see himbetter</s>  its a great thing to have the true system he said bendingtowards her in a friendly way im sure you have it in everything</s>  hewas not often hypocritical but when he was he went all lengths</s> well i dont know that any one has a right to say that</s>  i thought youwere verena she added in a moment taking him in again with her milddeliberate vision</s> i have been waiting for you to recognise me of course you didnt knowi was herei only arrived last night</s> well im glad you have come to see olive now</s> you remember that i wouldnt do that when i met you last</s> you asked me not to mention to her that i had met you thats what iprincipally recall</s> and dont you remember what i told you i wanted to do</s>  i wanted to goout to cambridge and see miss tarrant</s>  thanks to the information thatyou were so good as to give me i was able to do so</s> yes she gave me quite a little description of your visit said missbirdseye with a smile and a vague sound in her throata sort ofpensive private reference to the idea of laughterof which ransomnever learned the exact significance though he retained for a long timeafterwards a kindly memory of the old ladys manner at the moment</s> i dont know how much she enjoyed it but it was an immense pleasure tome so great a one that as you see i have come to call upon heragain</s> then i presume she has shaken you</s> she has shaken me tremendously</s>  said ransom laughing</s> well youll be a great addition miss birdseye returned</s>  and thistime your visit is also for miss chancellor</s> that depends on whether she will receive me</s> well if she knows you are shaken that will go a great way said missbirdseye a little musingly as if even to her unsophisticated mind ithad been manifested that ones relations with miss chancellor might beticklish</s>  but she cant receive you nowcan she</s> because shes out</s> she has gone to the post office for the boston letters and they get somany every day that she had to take verena with her to help her carrythem home</s>  one of them wanted to stay with me because doctor prance hasgone fishing but i said i presumed i could be left alone for aboutseven minutes</s>  i know how they love to be together it seems as if onecouldnt go out without the other</s>  thats what they came down herefor because its quiet and it didnt look as if there was any one elsethey would be much drawn to</s>  so it would be a pity for me to come downafter them just to spoil it</s> i am afraid i shall spoil it miss birdseye</s> oh well a gentleman murmured the ancient woman</s> yes what can you expect of a gentleman</s>  i certainly shall spoil it ifi can</s> you had better go fishing with doctor prance said miss birdseye witha serenity which showed that she was far from measuring the sinisterquality of the announcement he had just made</s> i shant object to that at all</s>  the days here must be very longveryfull of hours</s>  have you got the doctor with you</s>  ransom inquired as ifhe knew nothing at all about her</s> yes miss chancellor invited us both she is very thoughtful</s>  she isnot merely a theoretic philanthropistshe goes into details said missbirdseye presenting her large person in her chair as if she herselfwere only an item</s>  it seems as if we were not so much wanted in bostonjust in august</s> and here you sit and enjoy the breeze and admire the view the youngman remarked wondering when the two messengers whose seven minutesmust long since have expired would return from the post office</s> yes i enjoy everything in this little oldworld place i didntsuppose i should be satisfied to be so passive</s>  its a great contrast tomy former exertions</s>  but somehow it doesnt seem as if there were anytrouble or any wrong round here and if there should be there are misschancellor and miss tarrant to look after it</s>  they seem to think i hadbetter fold my hands</s>  besides when helpful generous minds begin toflock in from your part of the country miss birdseye continuedlooking at him from under the distorted and discoloured canopy of herhat with a benignity which completed the idea in any cheerful sense hechose</s> he felt by this time that he was committed to rather a dishonest parthe was pledged not to give a shock to her optimism</s>  this might cost himin the coming days a good deal of dissimulation but he was now savedfrom any further expenditure of ingenuity by certain warning soundswhich admonished him that he must keep his wits about him for a purposemore urgent</s>  there were voices in the hall of the house voices he knewwhich came nearer quickly so that before he had time to rise one ofthe speakers had come out with the exclamationdear miss birdseyehere are seven letters for you</s>  the words fell to the ground indeedbefore they were fairly spoken and when ransom got up turning he sawolive chancellor standing there with the parcel from the post office inher hand</s>  she stared at him in sudden horror for the moment herselfpossession completely deserted her</s>  there was so little of anygreeting in her face save the greeting of dismay that he felt there wasnothing for him to say to her nothing that could mitigate the odiousfact of his being there</s>  he could only let her take it in let herdivine that this time he was not to be got rid of</s>  in an instanttoease off the situationhe held out his hand for miss birdseyesletters and it was a proof of olives having turned rather faint andweak that she gave them up to him</s>  he delivered the packet to the oldlady and now verena had appeared in the doorway of the house</s>  as soonas she saw him she blushed crimson but she did not like olive standvoiceless</s> why mr</s>  ransom she cried out where in the world were you washedashore</s>  miss birdseye meanwhile taking her letters had no appearanceof observing that the encounter between olive and her visitor was a kindof concussion</s> it was verena who eased off the situation her gay challenge rose to herlips as promptly as if she had had no cause for embarrassment</s>  she wasnot confused even when she blushed and her alertness may perhaps beexplained by the habit of public speaking</s>  ransom smiled at her whileshe came forward but he spoke first to olive who had already turnedher eyes away from him and gazed at the blue seaview as if she werewondering what was going to happen to her at last</s> of course you are very much surprised to see me but i hope to be ableto induce you to regard me not absolutely in the light of an intruder</s>  ifound your door open and i walked in and miss birdseye seemed to thinki might stay</s>  miss birdseye i put myself under your protection iinvoke you i appeal to you the young man went on</s>  adopt me answerfor me cover me with the mantle of your charity</s> miss birdseye looked up from her letters as if at first she had onlyfaintly heard his appeal</s>  she turned her eyes from olive to verena thenshe said doesnt it seem as if we had room for all</s>  when i rememberwhat i have seen in the south mr</s>  ransoms being here strikes me as agreat triumph</s> olive evidently failed to understand and verena broke in witheagerness it was by my letter of course that you knew we were here</s> the one i wrote just before we came olive she went on</s>  dont youremember i showed it to you</s> at the mention of this act of submission on her friends part olivestarted flashing her a strange look then she said to basil that shedidnt see why he should explain so much about his coming every one hada right to come</s>  it was a very charming place it ought to do any onegood</s>  but it will have one defect for you she added threequartersof the summer residents are women</s> this attempted pleasantry on miss chancellors part so unexpected soincongruous uttered with white lips and cold eyes struck ransom tothat degree by its oddity that he could not resist exchanging a glanceof wonder with verena who if she had had the opportunity couldprobably have explained to him the phenomenon</s>  olive had recoveredherself reminded herself that she was safe that her companion in newyork had repudiated denounced her pursuer and as a proof to her ownsense of her security as well as a touching mark to verena that nowafter what had passed she had no fear she felt that a certain lightmockery would be effective</s> ah miss olive dont pretend to think i love your sex so little whenyou know that what you really object to in me is that i love it toomuch</s>  ransom was not brazen he was not impudent he was really a verymodest man but he was aware that whatever he said or did he wascondemned to seem impudent now and he argued within himself that if hewas to have the dishonour of being thought brazen he might as well havethe comfort</s>  he didnt care a straw in truth how he was judged or howhe might offend he had a purpose which swallowed up such inanities asthat and he was so full of it that it kept him firm balanced him gavehim an assurance that might easily have been confounded with a colddetachment</s>  this place will do me good he pursued i havent had aholiday for more than two years i couldnt have gone another day i wasfinished</s>  i would have written to you beforehand that i was coming buti only started at a few hours notice</s>  it occurred to me that this wouldbe just what i wanted i remembered what miss tarrant had said in hernote that it was a place where people could lie on the ground and weartheir old clothes</s>  i delight to lie on the ground and all my clothesare old</s>  i hope to be able to stay three or four weeks</s> olive listened till he had done speaking she stood a single momentlonger and then without a word a glance she rushed into the house</s> ransom saw that miss birdseye was immersed in her letters so he wentstraight to verena and stood before her looking far into her eyes</s>  hewas not smiling now as he had been in speaking to olive</s>  will you comesomewhere apart where i can speak to you alone</s> why have you done this</s>  it was not right in you to come</s>
i have come because it is necessarybecause i have something veryimportant to say to you</s>  a great number of things</s> the same things you said in new york</s>  i dont want to hear themagainthey were horrible</s> no not the samedifferent ones</s>  i want you to come out with me awayfrom here</s> you always want me to come out</s>  we cant go out here we are out asmuch as we can be</s>  verena laughed</s>  she tried to turn it offfeelingthat something really impended</s> come down into the garden and out beyond thereto the water where wecan speak</s>  its what i have come for it was not for what i told missolive</s> he had lowered his voice as if miss olive might still hear them andthere was something strangely gravealtogether solemn indeedin itstone</s>  verena looked around her at the splendid summer day at themuchswathed formless figure of miss birdseye holding her letterinside her hat</s>  mr</s>  ransom</s>  she articulated then simply and as hereyes met his again they showed him a couple of tears</s> its not to make you suffer i honestly believe</s>  i dont want to sayanything that will hurt you</s>  how can i possibly hurt you when i feel toyou as i do</s>  he went on with suppressed force</s> she said no more but all her face entreated him to let her off tospare her and as this look deepened a quick sense of elation andsuccess began to throb in his heart for it told him exactly what hewanted to know</s>  it told him that she was afraid of him that she hadceased to trust herself that the way he had read her nature was theright way she was tremendously open to attack she was meant for loveshe was meant for him and that his arriving at the point at which hewished to arrive was only a question of time</s>  this happy consciousnessmade him extraordinarily tender to her he couldnt put enoughreassurance into his smile his low murmur as he said only give meten minutes dont receive me by turning me away</s>  its my holidaymypoor little holiday dont spoil it</s> three minutes later miss birdseye looking up from her letter saw themmove together through the bristling garden and traverse a gap in the oldfence which enclosed the further side of it</s>  they passed into theancient shipyard which lay beyond and which was now a mere vaguegrassgrown approach to the waterside bestrewn with a few remnants ofsupererogatory timber</s>  she saw them stroll forward to the edge of thebay and stand there taking the soft breeze in their faces</s>  she watchedthem a little and it warmed her heart to see the stiffnecked youngsoutherner led captive by a daughter of new england trained in the rightschool who would impose her opinions in their integrity</s>  consideringhow prejudiced he must have been he was certainly behaving very welleven at that distance miss birdseye dimly made out that there wassomething positively humble in the way he invited verena tarrant to seatherself on a low pile of weatherblackened planks which constituted theprincipal furniture of the place and something perhaps just a trifletoo expressive of righteous triumph in the manner in which the girl putthe suggestion by and stood where she liked a little proudly turning agood deal away from him</s>  miss birdseye could see as much as this butshe couldnt hear so that she didnt know what it was that made verenaturn suddenly back to him at something he said</s>  if she had knownperhaps his observation would have struck her as less singularunderthe circumstances in which these two young persons metthan it mayappear to the reader</s> they have accepted one of my articles i think its the best</s>  thesewere the first words that passed basil ransoms lips after the pair hadwithdrawn as far as it was possible to withdraw in that direction fromthe house</s> oh is it printedwhen does it appear</s>  verena asked that questioninstantly it sprang from her lips in a manner that completely beliedthe air of keeping herself at a distance from him which she had worn afew moments before</s> he didnt tell her again this time as he had told her when on theoccasion of their walk together in new york she expressed aninconsequent hope that his fortune as a rejected contributor would takea turnhe didnt remark to her once more that she was a delightfulbeing he only went on as if her revulsion were a matter of course toexplain everything he could so that she might as soon as possible knowhim better and see how completely she could trust him</s>  that was atbottom the reason i came here</s>  the essay in question is the mostimportant thing i have done in the way of a literary attempt and idetermined to give up the game or to persist according as i should beable to bring it to the light or not</s>  the other day i got a letter fromthe editor of the rational review telling me that he should be veryhappy to print it that he thought it very remarkable and that heshould be glad to hear from me again</s>  he shall hear from me againheneednt be afraid</s>  it contained a good many of the opinions i haveexpressed to you and a good many more besides</s>  i really believe it willattract some attention</s>  at any rate the simple fact that it is to bepublished makes an era in my life</s>  this will seem pitiful to you nodoubt who publish yourself have been before the world these severalyears and are flushed with every

have put you in the biggest and fairest of them</s> thats a great change and as i say its really why i came on</s> verena lost not a word of this gentle conciliatory explicit statementit was full of surprises for her and as soon as ransom had stoppedspeaking she inquired why didnt you feel satisfied about your futurebefore</s> her tone made him feel how little she had suspected he could have theweakness of a discouragement how little of a question it must haveseemed to her that he would one day triumph on his own erratic line</s>  itwas the sweetest tribute he had yet received to the idea that he mighthave ability the letter of the editor of the rational review wasnothing to it</s>  no i felt very blue it didnt seem to me at all clearthat there was a place for me in the world</s> gracious</s>  said verena tarrant</s> a quarter of an hour later miss birdseye who had returned to herletters she had a correspondent at framingham who usually wrote fifteenpages became aware that

hope he is going to speak for us soon</s> verena hesitated a moment</s>  he speaks with the pen</s>  he has written avery fine articlefor the rational review</s> miss birdseye gazed at her young friend complacently the sheets of herinterminable letter fluttered in the breeze</s>  well its delightful tosee the way it goes on isnt it</s> verena scarcely knew what to say then remembering that doctor prancehad told her that they might lose their dear old companion any day andconfronting it with something basil ransom had just saidthat therational review was a quarterly and the editor had notified him thathis article would appear only in the number after the nextshereflected that perhaps miss birdseye wouldnt be there so many monthslater to see how it was her supposed consort had spoken</s>  she mighttherefore be left to believe what she liked to believe without fear ofa day of reckoning</s>  verena committed herself to nothing moreconfirmatory than a kiss however which the old ladys displacedheadgear enabled her to imprint upon her forehead and which caused missbirdseye to exclaim why verena tarrant how cold your lips are</s>  itwas not surprising to verena to hear that her lips were cold a mortalchill had crept over her for she knew that this time she should have atremendous scene with olive</s> she found her in her room to which she had fled on quitting mr</s> ransoms presence she sat in the window having evidently sunk into achair the moment she came in a position from which she must have seenverena walk through the garden and down to the water with the intruder</s> she remained as she had collapsed quite prostrate her attitude was thesame as that other time verena had found her waiting in new york</s>  whatolive was likely to say to her first the girl scarcely knew her mindat any rate was full of an intention of her own</s>  she went straight toher and fell on her knees before her taking hold of the hands whichwere clasped together with

keptthat back</s>  i did so on purpose i cant explain why except that ididnt like to tell you and that i thought it better</s>  but now i wantyou to know everything when you know that you will know

 but now i want you to know allall</s> verena spoke with breathless haste and eagerness there was a kind ofpassion in the way she tried to expiate her former want of candour</s> olive listened staring at first she seemed scarcely to understand</s>  butverena perceived that she understood sufficiently when she broke outyou deceived meyou deceived me</s>  well i must say i like your deceitbetter than such dreadful revelations</s>  and what does anything matterwhen he has come after you now</s>  what does he wantwhat has he comefor</s> he has come to ask me to be his wife</s> verena said this with the same eagerness with as determined an air ofnot incurring any reproach this time</s>  but as soon as she had spoken sheburied her head in olives lap</s> olive made no attempt to raise it again and returned none of thepressure of her hands she only sat silent for a time during whichverena wondered that the idea of the episode at cambridge laid bareonly after so many months should not have struck her more deeply</s> presently she saw it was because the horror of what had just happeneddrew her off from it</s>  at last olive asked is that what he told youoff there by the water</s> yesand verena

done basil ransom taking in perfectly good part misschancellors reflexions on his delicacy and making them the subject ofmuch free laughter</s>  she could not know for in the midst of his hilaritythe young man did not compose himself to tell her that he had made uphis mind on this question before he left new yorkas long ago as whenhe wrote her the note subsequent to her departure from that city towhich allusion has already been made and which was simply the fellow ofthe letter addressed to her after his visit to cambridge a friendlyrespectful yet rather pregnant sign that decidedly on secondthoughts separation didnt imply for him the intention of silence</s>  weknow a little about his second thoughts as much as is essential andespecially how the occasion of their springing up had been the windfallof an editors encouragement</s>  the importance of that encouragement tobasils imagination was doubtless much augmented by his desire for anexcuse to take up again a line of behaviour which he had forsworn smallas had as yet been his opportunity to indulge in it very much lessthan he supposed still it worked an appreciable revolution in his viewof his case and made him ask himself what amount of consideration heshould from the most refined southern point of view owe misschancellor in the event of his deciding to go after verena tarrant inearnest</s>  he was not slow to decide that he owed her none</s>  chivalry hadto do with ones relations with people one hated not with those oneloved</s>  he didnt hate poor miss olive though she might make him yetand even if he did any chivalry was all moonshine which should requirehim to give up the girl he adored in order that his third cousin shouldsee he could be gallant</s>  chivalry was forbearance and generosity withregard to the weak and there was nothing weak about miss olive she wasa fighting woman and she would fight him to the death giving him notan inch of odds</s>  he felt that she was fighting there all day long inher cottage fortress her resistance was in the air he breathed andverena came out to him sometimes quite limp and pale from the tussle</s> it was in the same jocose spirit with which he regarded olives view ofthe sort of standard a mississippian should live up to that he talked toverena about the lecture she was preparing for her great exhibition atthe music hall</s>  he learned from her that she was to take the field inthe manner of mrs</s>  farrinder for a winter campaign carrying with her atremendous big gun</s>  her engagements were all made her route was markedout she expected to repeat her lecture in about fifty different places</s> it was to be called a womans reason and both olive and miss birdseyethought it so far as they could tell in advance her most promisingeffort</s>  she wasnt going to trust to inspiration this time she didntwant to meet a big boston audience without knowing where she was</s> inspiration moreover seemed rather to have faded away in consequenceof olives influence she had read and studied so much that it seemed nowas if everything must take form beforehand</s>  olive was a splendid criticwhether he liked her or not and she had made her go over every word ofher lecture twenty times</s>  there wasnt an intonation she hadnt made herpractise it was very different from the old system when her father hadworked her up</s>  if basil considered women superficial it was a pity hecouldnt see what olives standard of preparation was or be present attheir rehearsals in the evening in their little parlour</s>  ransomsstate of mind in regard to the affair at the music hall was simplythisthat he was determined to circumvent it if he could</s>  he covered itwith ridicule in talking of it to verena and the shafts he levelled atit went so far that he could see she thought he exaggerated his disliketo it</s>  in point of fact he could not have overstated that so odious didthe idea seem to him that she was soon to be launched in a moreinfatuated career</s>  he vowed to himself that she should never take thatfresh start which would commit her irretrievably if she should succeedand she would succeedhe had not the slightest doubt of her power toproduce a sensation in the music hall to the acclamations of thenewspapers</s>  he didnt care for her engagements her campaigns or allthe expectancy of her friends to squelch all that at a stroke wasthe dearest wish of his heart</s>  it would represent to him his ownsuccess it would symbolise his victory</s>  it became a fixed idea withhim and he warned her again and again</s>  when she laughed and said shedidnt see how he could stop her unless he kidnapped her he reallypitied her for not perceiving beneath his ominous pleasantries thefirmness of his resolution</s>  he felt almost capable of kidnapping her</s>  itwas palpably in the air that she would become widely popular and thatidea simply sickened him</s>  he felt as differently as possible about itfrom mr</s>  matthias pardon</s> one afternoon as he returned with verena from a walk which had beenaccomplished completely within the prescribed conditions he saw from adistance doctor prance who had emerged bareheaded from the cottageand shading her eyes from the red declining sun was looking up anddown the road</s>  it was part of the regulation that ransom should separatefrom verena before reaching the house and they had just paused toexchange their last words which every day promoted the situation morethan any others when doctor prance began to beckon to them with muchanimation</s>  they hurried forward verena pressing her hand to her heartfor she had instantly guessed that something terrible had happened tooliveshe had given out fainted away perhaps fallen dead with thecruelty of the strain</s>  doctor prance watched them come with a curiouslook in her face it was not a smile but a kind of exaggeratedintimation that she noticed nothing</s>  in an instant she had told themwhat was the matter</s>  miss birdseye had had a sudden weakness she hadremarked abruptly that she was dying and her pulse sure enough hadfallen to nothing</s>  she was down on the piazza with miss chancellor andherself and they had tried to get her up to bed</s>  but she wouldnt letthem move her she was passing away and she wanted to pass away justthere in such a pleasant place in her customary chair looking at thesunset</s>  she asked for miss tarrant and miss chancellor told her she wasoutwalking with mr</s>  ransom</s>  then she wanted to know if mr</s>  ransom wasstill thereshe supposed he had gone</s>  basil knew by verena apartfrom this that his name had not been mentioned to the old lady sincethe morning he saw her</s>  she expressed a wish to see himshe hadsomething to say to him and miss chancellor told her that he would beback soon with verena and that they would bring him in</s>  miss birdseyesaid she hoped they wouldnt be long because she was sinking anddoctor prance now added like a person who knew what she was talkingabout that it was in fact the end</s>  she had darted out two or threetimes to look for them and they must step right in</s>  verena had scarcelygiven her time to tell her story she had already rushed into the house</s> ransom followed with doctor prance conscious that for him the occasionwas doubly solemn inasmuch as if he was to see poor miss birdseye yieldup her philanthropic soul he was on the other hand doubtless to receivefrom miss chancellor a reminder that she had no intention of quittingthe game</s> by the time he had made this reflexion he stood in the presence of hiskinswoman and her venerable guest who was sitting just as he had seenher before muffled and bonneted on the back piazza of the cottage</s> olive chancellor was on one side of her holding one of her hands and onthe other was verena who had dropped on her knees close to herbending over those of the old lady</s>  did you ask for medid you wantme</s>  the girl said tenderly</s>  i will never leave you again</s> oh i wont keep you long</s>  i only wanted to see you once more</s>  missbirdseyes voice was very low like that of a person breathing withdifficulty but it had no painful nor querulous noteit expressed onlythe cheerful weariness which had marked all this last period of herlife and which seemed to make it now as blissful as it was suitablethat she should pass away</s>  her head was thrown back against the top ofthe chair the ribbon which confined her ancient hat hung loose and thelate afternoon light covered her octogenarian face and gave it a kind offairness a double placidity</s>  there was to ransom something almostaugust in the trustful renunciation of her countenance something in itseemed to say that she had been ready long before but as the time wasnot ripe she had waited with her usual faith that all was for the bestonly at present since the right conditions met she couldnt helpfeeling that it was quite a luxury the greatest she had ever tasted</s> ransom knew why it was that verena had tears in her eyes as she lookedup at her patient old friend she had spoken to him often during thelast three weeks of the stories miss birdseye had told her of the greatwork of her life her mission repeated year after year among thesouthern blacks</s>  she had gone among them with every precaution to teachthem to read and write she had carried them bibles and told them of thefriends they had in the north who prayed for their deliverance</s>  ransomknew that verena didnt reproduce these legends with a view to makinghim ashamed of his southern origin his connexion with people who in apast not yet remote had made that kind of apostleship necessary heknew this because she had heard what he thought of all that chapterhimself he had given her a kind of historical summary of the slaveryquestion which left her no room to say that he was more tender to thatparticular example of human imbecility than he was to any other</s>  but shehad told him that this was what she would have liked to doto wanderalone with her life in her hand on an errand of mercy through acountry in which society was arrayed against her she would have likedit much better than simply talking about the right from the gaslightedvantage of the new england platform</s>  ransom had replied simplybalderdash</s>  it being his theory as we have perceived that he knewmuch more about verenas native bent than the young lady herself</s>  thisdid not however as he was perfectly aware prevent her feeling thatshe had come too late for the heroic age of new england life andregarding miss birdseye as a battered immemorial monument of it</s>  ransomcould share such an admiration as that especially at this moment hehad said to verena more than once that he wished he might have met theold lady in carolina or georgia before the warshown her round amongthe negroes and talked over new england ideas with her there were agood many he didnt care much about now but at that time they wouldhave been tremendously refreshing</s>  miss birdseye had given herself awayso lavishly all her life that it was rather odd there was anything leftof her for the supreme surrender</s>  when he looked at olive he saw thatshe meant to ignore him and during the few minutes he remained on thespot his kinswoman never met his eye</s>  she turned away indeed as soonas doctor prance said leaning over miss birdseye i have brought mr</s> ransom to you</s>  dont you remember you asked for him</s> i am very glad to see you again ransom remarked</s>  it was very good ofyou to think of me</s>  at the sound of his voice olive rose and left herplace she sank into a chair at the other end of the piazza turninground to rest her arms on the back and bury her head in them</s> miss birdseye looked at the young man still more dimly than she had everdone before</s>  i thought you were gone</s>  you never came back</s> he spends all his time in long walks he enjoys the country so muchverena said</s> well its very beautiful what i see from here</s>  i havent been strongenough to move round since the first days</s>  but i am going to move now</s> she smiled when ransom made a gesture as if to help her and added ohi dont mean i am going to move out of my chair</s> mr</s>  ransom has been out in a boat with me several times</s>  i have beenshowing him how to cast a line said doctor prance who appeared todeprecate a sentimental tendency</s> oh well then you have been one of our party there seems to be everyreason why you should feel that you belong to us</s>  miss birdseye lookedat the visitor with a sort of misty earnestness as if she wished tocommunicate with him further then her glance turned slightly aside shetried to see what had become of olive</s>  she perceived that misschancellor had withdrawn herself and closing her eyes she musedineffectually on the mystery she had not grasped the peculiarity ofbasil ransoms relations with her hostess</s>  she was visibly too weak toconcern herself with it very actively she only felt now that sheseemed really to be going a desire to reconcile and harmonise</s>  but shepresently exhaled a low soft sigha kind of confession that it was toomixed that she gave it up</s>  ransom had feared for a moment that she wasabout to indulge in some appeal to olive some attempt to make him joinhands with that young lady as a supreme satisfaction to herself</s>  but hesaw that her strength failed her and that besides things were gettingless clear to her to his considerable relief inasmuch as though hewould not have objected to joining hands the expression of misschancellors figure and her averted face with their desperate collapseshowed him well enough how she would have met such a proposal</s>  whatmiss birdseye clung to with benignant perversity was the idea that inspite of his exclusion from the house which was perhaps only the resultof a certain highstrung jealousy on olives part of her friends otherpersonal ties verena had drawn him in had made him sympathise with thegreat reform and desire to work for it</s>  ransom saw no reason why such anillusion should be dear to miss birdseye his contact with her in thepast had been so momentary that he could not account for her taking aninterest in his views in his throwing his weight into the right scale</s> it was part of the general desire for justice that fermented within herthe passion for progress and it was also in some degree her interest inverenaa suspicion innocent and idyllic as any such suspicion on missbirdseyes part must be that there was something between them that theclosest of all unions as miss birdseye at least supposed it was waspreparing itself</s>  then his being a southerner gave a point to the wholething to bring round a southerner would be a real encouragement for onewho had seen even at a time when she was already an old woman what wasthe tone of opinion in the cotton states</s>  ransom had no wish todiscourage her and he bore well in mind the caution doctor prance hadgiven him about destroying her last theory</s>  he only bowed his head veryhumbly not knowing what he had done to earn the honour of being thesubject of it</s>  his eyes met verenas as she looked up at him from herplace at miss birdseyes feet and he saw she was following his thoughtthrowing herself into it and trying to communicate to him a wish</s>  thewish touched him immensely she was dreadfully afraid he would betrayher to miss birdseyelet her know how she had cooled off</s>  verena wasashamed of that now and trembled at the danger of exposure her eyesadjured him to be careful of what he said</s>  her tremor made him glow alittle in return for it seemed to him the fullest confession of hisinfluence she had yet made</s> we have been a very happy little party she said to the old lady</s>  itis delightful that you should have been able to be with us all theseweeks</s> it has been a great rest</s>  i am very tired</s>  i cant speak much</s>  it hasbeen a lovely time</s>  i have done so muchso many things</s> i guess i wouldnt talk much miss birdseye said doctor prance whohad now knelt down on the other side of her</s>  we know how much you havedone</s>  dont you suppose every one knows your life</s> it isnt muchonly i tried to take hold</s>  when i look back from herefrom where weve sat i can measure the progress</s>  thats what i wantedto say to you and mr</s>  ransombecause im going fast</s>  hold on to methats right but you cant keep me</s>  i dont want to stay now i presumei shall join

thinktheres no progress because you dont see it all right off thats whati wanted to say</s>  it isnt till you have gone a long way that you canfeel whats been done</s>  thats what i see when i look back from here isee that the community wasnt half waked up when i was young</s> it is you that have waked it up more than any one else and its forthat we honour you miss birdseye</s>  verena cried with a sudden violenceof emotion</s>  if you were to live for a thousand years you would thinkonly of othersyou would think only of helping on humanity</s>  you are ourheroine you are our saint and there has never been any one like you</s> verena had no glance for ransom now and there was neither deprecationnor entreaty in her face</s>  a wave of contrition of shame had swept overhera quick desire to atone for her secret swerving by a renewedrecognition of the nobleness of such a life as miss birdseyes</s> oh i havent effected very much i have only cared and hoped</s>  you willdo more than i have ever doneyou and olive chancellor because you areyoung and bright brighter than i ever was and besides everything hasgot started</s> well youve got started miss birdseye doctor prance remarked withraised eyebrows protesting dryly but kindly and putting forward withan air as if after all it didnt matter much an authority that hadbeen superseded</s>  the manner in which this competent little womanindulged her patient showed sufficiently that the good lady was sinkingfast</s> we will think of you always and your name will be sacred to us andthat will teach us singleness and devotion verena went on in the sametone still not meeting ransoms eyes again and speaking as if she weretrying now to stop herself to tie herself by a vow</s> well its the thing you and olive have given your lives to that hasabsorbed me most of late years</s>  i did want to see justice doneto us</s> i havent seen it but you will</s>  and olive will</s>  where is shewhy isntshe near me to bid me farewell</s>  and mr</s>  ransom willand he will beproud to have helped</s> oh mercy mercy</s>  cried verena burying her head in miss birdseyeslap</s> you are not mistaken if you think i desire above all things that yourweakness your generosity should be protected ransom said ratherambiguously but with pointed respectfulness</s>  i shall remember you asan example of what women are capable of he added and he had nosubsequent compunctions for the speech for he thought poor missbirdseye for all her absence of profile essentially feminine</s> a kind of frantic moan from olive chancellor responded to these wordswhich had evidently struck her as an insolent sarcasm and at the samemoment doctor prance sent ransom a glance which was an adjuration todepart</s> goodbye olive chancellor miss birdseye murmured</s>  i dont want tostay though i should like to see what you will see</s> i shall see nothing but shame and ruin</s>  olive shrieked rushing acrossto her old friend while ransom discreetly quitted the scene</s> xxxixhe met doctor prance in the village the next morning and as soon as helooked at her he saw that the event which had been impending at misschancellors had taken place</s>  it was not that her aspect was funerealbut it contained somehow an announcement that she had for thepresent no more thought to give to casting a line</s>  miss birdseye hadquietly passed away in the evening an hour or two after ransomsvisit</s>  they had wheeled her chair into the house there had been nothingto do but wait for complete extinction</s>  miss chancellor and miss tarranthad sat by her there without moving each of her hands in theirs andshe had just melted away towards eight oclock</s>  it was a lovely deathdoctor prance intimated that she had never seen any that she thoughtmore seasonable</s>  she added that she was a good womanone of the oldsort and that was the only funeral oration that basil ransom wasdestined to hear pronounced upon miss birdseye</s>  the impression of thesimplicity and humility of her end remained with him and he reflectedmore than once during the days that followed that the absence of pompand circumstance which had marked her career marked also theconsecration of her memory</s>  she had been almost celebrated she had beenactive earnest ubiquitous beyond any one else she had given herselfutterly to charities and creeds and causes and yet the only personsapparently to whom her death made a real difference were three youngwomen in a small framehouse on cape cod</s>  ransom learned from doctorprance that her mortal remains were to be committed to their rest in thelittle cemetery at marmion in sight of the pretty seaview she loved togaze at among old mossy headstones of mariners and fisherfolk</s>  she hadseen the place when she first came down when she was able to drive outa little and she had said she thought it must be pleasant to lie there</s> it was not an injunction a definite request it had not occurred tomiss birdseye at the end of her days to take an exacting line or tomake for the first time in eighty years a personal claim</s>  but olivechancellor and verena had put their construction on her appreciation ofthe quietest corner of the striving suffering world so weary a pilgrimof philanthropy had ever beheld</s> in the course of the day ransom received a note of five lines fromverena the purport of which was to tell him that he must not expect tosee her again for the present she wished to be very quiet and thinkthings over</s>  she added the recommendation that he should leave theneighbourhood for three or four days there were plenty of strange oldplaces to see in that part of the country</s>  ransom meditated deeply onthis missive and perceived that he should be guilty of very bad tastein not immediately absenting himself</s>  he knew that to olive chancellorsvision his conduct already wore that stain and it was uselesstherefore for him to consider how he could displease her either less ormore</s>  but he wished to convey to verena the impression that he would doanything in the wide world to gratify her except give her up and ashe packed his valise he had an idea that he was both behavingbeautifully and showing the finest diplomatic sense</s>  to go away provedto himself how secure he felt what a conviction he had that however shemight turn and twist in his grasp he held her fast</s>  the emotion she hadexpressed as he stood there before poor miss birdseye was only one ofher instinctive contortions he had taken due note of thatsaid tohimself that a good many more would probably occur before she would bequiet</s>  a woman that listens is lost the old proverb says and what hadverena done for the last three weeks but listen</s> not very long

know that if shestayed on the field it was because she preferred to</s>  she probably had anidea she was fighting but if she should fight no harder than she hadfought up to now he should continue to take the same view of hissuccess</s>  she meant her request that he should go away for a few days assomething combative but decidedly he scarcely felt the blow</s>  he likedto think that he had great tact with women and he was sure verena wouldbe struck with this quality in reading in the note he presentlyaddressed her in reply to her own that he had determined to take alittle run to

afew of miss birdseyes friends of the time and place of her obsequies</s> this young lady was shut up with verena and doctor prance wastransacting all their business for them</s>  ransom felt that he made noadmission that would impugn his estimate of the sex to which she in amanner belonged in reflecting that she would acquit herself of thesedelegated duties with the greatest rapidity and accuracy</s>  he told her hewas going to absent himself for a few days and expressed a friendlyhope that he should find her at marmion on his return</s> her keen eye gauged him a moment to see if he

he kept her a moment he wanted to ask her about verena</s> while he was hesitating how to form his question she remarked evidentlywishing to leave him a little memento of her sympathy well i hope youwill be able to follow up your views</s> my views miss prance</s>  i am sure i have never mentioned them to you</s> then ransom added how is miss tarrant today</s>  is she more calm</s> oh no she isnt calm at all doctor prance answered very definitely</s> do you mean shes excited emotional</s> well she doesnt talk shes perfectly still and so is misschancellor</s>  theyre as still as two watchersthey dont speak</s>  but youcan hear the silence vibrate</s> vibrate</s> well they are very nervous</s> ransom was confident as i say yet the effort that he made to extract agood omen from this characterisation of the two ladies at the cottagewas not altogether successful</s>  he would have liked to ask doctor prancewhether she didnt think he might count on verena in the end but he wastoo shy for this the subject of his relations with miss tarrant neveryet having been touched upon between them and besides he didnt careto hear himself put a question which was more or less an implication ofa doubt</s>  so he compromised with a sort of oblique and general inquiryabout olive that might draw some light</s>  what do you think of misschancellorhow does she strike you</s> doctor prance reflected a little with an apparent consciousness that hemeant more than he asked</s>  well shes losing flesh she presentlyreplied and ransom turned away not encouraged and feeling that nodoubt

theancient wharves where the grass grew thick and the impression of fallengreatness was still stronger than at marmion</s>  like his friends thebostonians he was very nervous there were days when he felt he mustrush back to the margin of that mild inlet the voices of the airwhispered to him that in his absence he was being outwitted</s> nevertheless he stayed the time he had determined to stay quietinghimself with the reflexion that there was nothing they could do to eludehim unless perhaps they should start again for europe which they werenot likely to do</s>  if miss olive tried to hide verena away in the unitedstates he would undertake to find herthough he was obliged to confessthat a flight to europe would baffle him owing to his want of cash forpursuit</s>  nothing however was less probable than that they would crossthe atlantic on the eve of verenas projected dbut at the music hall</s> before he went back to marmion he wrote to this young lady to announcehis reappearance there and let her know that he expected she would comeout to meet him the morning after</s>  this conveyed the assurance that heintended to take as much of the day as he could get he had had enoughof the system of dragging through all the hours till a mere fraction oftime was left before night and he couldnt wait so long at any ratethe day after his return</s>  it was the afternoon train that had broughthim back from provincetown and in the evening he ascertained that thebostonians had not deserted the field</s>  there were lights in the windowsof the house under the elms and he stood where he had stood thatevening with doctor prance and listened to the waves of verenas voiceas she rehearsed her lecture</s>  there were no waves this time no soundsand no sign of life but the lamps the place

violence of her terror the eagerness of her griefand now she was too weary to struggle with fate</s>  she appeared to herselfalmost to have accepted it as she wandered forth in the beautifulafternoon

boattogether one of the village worthies from whom small craft were to behired had at verenas request sent his little son to misschancellors cottage with that information</s>  she had not understoodwhether they had taken the boatman with them</s>  even when the informationcame and it came at a moment of considerable reassurance olivesnerves were not ploughed up by it as they had been

every boat that passed and begthat the young lady who was sailing somewhere in the bay with a darkgentleman with long hair should be entreated immediately to return</s>  onthe contrary after the first quiver of pain inflicted by the news shehad been able to occupy herself to look after her house to write hermornings letters to go into her accounts which she had had some timeon her mind</s>  she had wanted to put off thinking for she knew to whathideous recognitions that would bring her round again</s>  these were summedup in the fact that verena was now not to be trusted for an hour</s>  shehad sworn to her the night before with a face like a lacerated angelsthat her choice was made that their union and their work were more toher than any other life could ever be and that she deeply believed

truths to him andthen they would take up their old happy active fruitful days againwould throw themselves more than ever into their splendid effort</s>  olivehad seen how verena was moved by miss birdseyes death how at the sightof that unique womans majestically simple withdrawal from a scene inwhich she had held every vulgar aspiration every worldly standard andlure so cheap the girl had been

suffered and who waited still</s>  this helpedolive to believe that she might begin to count upon her again consciousas she was at the same time that verena had been strangely weakened andstrained by her odious ordeal</s>  oh olive knew that she loved himknewwhat the passion was with which the wretched girl had to struggle andshe did her the justice to believe that her professions were sincereher effort was real</s>  harassed and embittered as she was olivechancellor still proposed to herself to be rigidly just and that is whyshe pitied verena now with an unspeakable pity regarded her as thevictim of an atrocious spell and reserved all her execration andcontempt for the author of their common misery</s>  if verena had steppedinto a boat with him half an hour after declaring that she would givehim his dismissal in twenty words that was because he had ways knownto himself and other men of creating situations without an issue offorcing her to do things she could do only with sharp repugnance underthe menace of pain that would be sharper still</s>  but all the same whatactually stared her in the face was that verena was not to be trustedeven after rallying again as passionately as she had done during thedays that followed miss birdseyes death</s>  olive would have liked to knowthe pang of penance that she would have been afraid in her place toincur to see the locked door which she would not have managed toforce open</s> this inexpressibly mournful sense that after all verena in herexquisite delicacy and generosity was appointed only to show how womenhad from the beginning of time been the sport of mens selfishness andavidity this dismal conviction accompanied olive on her walk whichlasted all the afternoon and in which she found a kind of tragicrelief</s>  she went very far keeping in the lonely places unveiling herface to the splendid light which seemed to make a mock of the darknessand bitterness of her spirit</s>  there were little sandy coves where

still sported on a hot day in august his immemorial waterproofbut his wife rustled over the low tombstones at marmion in garments ofwhich little as she was versed in such inquiries olive could see thatthe cost had been large</s>  besides after doctor prance had gone when allwas over she felt what a relief it was that verena and she could bejust togethertogether with the monstrous wedge of a question that hadcome up between them</s>  that was company enough great heaven</s>  and she hadnot got rid of such an inmate as doctor prance only to put mrs</s>  tarrantin her place</s> did verenas strange aberration on this particular day suggest toolive that it was no use striving that the world was all a great trapor trick of which women were ever the punctual dupes so that it wasthe worst of

concern it issufficient for us to know that all human effort had never seemed to herso barren and thankless as on that fatal afternoon</s>  her eyes rested onthe boats she saw in the distance and she wondered if in one of themverena were floating to her fate but so far from straining forward tobeckon her home she almost wished that she might glide away for everthat she might never see her again

been but how it had all rested on an illusionof which the very thought made her feel faint and sick</s>  what was beforeher now was the reality with the beautiful indifferent sky pouringdown its complacent rays upon it</s>  the reality was simply that verena hadbeen more to her than she ever was to verena and that with herexquisite natural art the girl had cared for their cause only becausefor the time no interest no fascination was greater</s>  her talent thetalent which was to achieve such wonders was nothing to her it was tooeasy she could leave it alone as she might close her piano formonths it was only to olive that it was everything</s>  verena hadsubmitted she had responded she had lent herself to olives incitementand exhortation because she was sympathetic and young and abundant andfanciful but it had been a kind of hothouse loyalty the mere contagionof example and a sentiment springing up from within had easily breatheda chill upon it</s>  did olive ask herself whether for so many months hercompanion had been only the most unconscious and most successful ofhumbugs</s>  here again i must plead a certain incompetence to give ananswer</s>  positive it is that she spared herself none of the inductions ofa reverie that seemed to dry up the mists and ambiguities of life</s>  thesehours of backward clearness come to all men and women once at leastwhen they read the past in the light of the present with the reasons ofthings like unobserved fingerposts protruding where they never sawthem before</s>  the journey behind them is mapped out and figured with itsfalse steps its wrong observations all its infatuated deludedgeography</s>  they understand as olive understood but it is probable thatthey rarely suffer as she suffered</s>  the sense of regret for her baffledcalculations burned within her like a fire and the splendour of thevision over which the curtain of mourning now was dropped brought to hereyes slow still tears tears that came one by one neither easing hernerves nor lightening her load of pain</s>
 she thought of her innumerabletalks with verena of the pledges they had exchanged of their earneststudies their faithful work their certain reward the winter nightsunder the lamp when they thrilled with previsions as just and a passionas high as had ever found shelter in a pair of human hearts</s>  the pity ofit the misery of such a fall after such a flight could express itselfonly as the poor girl prolonged the vague pauses of her unnoticedramble in a low inarticulate murmur of anguish</s> the afternoon waned bringing with it the slight chill which at thesummers end begins to mark the shortening days</s>
 she turned her facehomeward and by this time became conscious that if verenas companionhad not yet brought her back there might be ground for uneasiness as towhat had happened to them</s>  it seemed to her that no sailboat could haveput into the town without passing more or less before her eyes andshowing her whom it carried she had seen a dozen freighted only withthe figures of men</s>  an accident was perfectly possible what couldransom with his plantation habits know about the management of asail</s>  and once that danger loomed before herthe signal loveliness ofthe weather had prevented its striking her beforeolives imaginationhurried with a bound to the worst</s>  she saw the boat overturned anddrifting out to sea and after a week of nameless horror the body ofan unknown young woman defaced beyond recognition but with long auburnhair and in a white dress washed up in some faraway cove</s>  an hourbefore her mind had rested with a sort of relief on the idea thatverena should sink for ever beneath the horizon so that theirtremendous trouble might never be but now with the lateness of thehour a sharp immediate anxiety took the place of that intendedresignation and she quickened her step with a heart that galloped tooas she went</s>  then it was above all that she felt how she hadunderstood friendship and how never again to see the face of thecreature she had taken to her soul would be for her as the stroke ofblindness</s>  the twilight had become thick by the time she reached marmionand paused for an instant in front of her house over which the elmsthat stood on the grassy wayside appeared to her to hang a blackercurtain than ever before</s> there was no candle in any window and when she pushed in and stood inthe hall listening a moment her step awakened no answering sound</s>  herheart failed her verenas staying out in a boat from ten oclock in themorning till nightfall was too unnatural and she gave a cry as sherushed into the low dim parlour darkened on one side at that hour bythe widearmed foliage and on the other by the veranda and trelliswhich expressed only a wild personal passion a desire to take herfriend in her arms again on any terms even the most cruel to herself</s> the next moment she started back with another and a differentexclamation for verena was in the room motionless in a cornerthefirst place in which she had seated herself on reentering thehouselooking at her with a silent face which seemed strangeunnatural in the dusk</s>  olive stopped short and for a minute the twowomen remained as they were gazing at each other in the dimness</s>  afterthat too olive still said nothing she only went to verena and satdown beside her</s>  she didnt know what to make of her manner she hadnever been like that before</s>  she was unwilling to speak she seemedcrushed and humbled</s>  this was almost the worstif anything could beworse than what had gone before and olive took her hand with anirresistible impulse of compassion and assurance</s>  from the way it lay inher own she guessed her whole feelingsaw it was a kind of shame shamefor her weakness her swift surrender her insane gyration in themorning</s>  verena expressed it by no protest and no explanation sheappeared not even to wish to hear the sound of her own voice</s>  hersilence itself was an appealan appeal to olive to ask no questionsshe could trust her to inflict no spoken reproach only to wait tillshe could lift up her head again</s>  olive understood or thought sheunderstood and the woefulness of it all only seemed the deeper</s>  shewould just sit there and hold her hand that was all she could do theywere beyond each others help in any other way now</s>  verena leaned herhead back and closed her eyes and for an hour as nightfall settled inthe room neither of the young women spoke</s>  distinctly it was a kind ofshame</s>  after a while the parlourmaid very casual in the manner of theservants at marmion appeared on the threshold with a lamp but olivemotioned her frantically away</s>  she wished to keep the darkness</s>  it was akind of shame</s> the next morning basil ransom rapped loudly with his walkingstick onthe lintel of miss chancellors housedoor which as usual on finedays stood open</s>  there was no need he should wait till the servant hadanswered his summons for olive who had reason to believe he wouldcome and who had been lurking in the sittingroom for a purpose of herown stepped forth into the little hall</s> i am sorry to disturb you i had the hope thatfor a momenti mightsee miss tarrant</s>  that was the speech with which and a measuredsalutation he greeted his advancing kinswoman</s>  she faced him aninstant and her strange green eyes caught the light</s> its impossible</s>  you may believe that when i say it</s> why is it impossible</s>  he asked smiling in spite of an inwarddispleasure</s>  and as olive gave him no answer only gazing at him with acold audacity which he had not hitherto observed in her he added alittle explanation</s>  it is simply to have seen her before i goto havesaid five words to her</s>  i want her to know that i have made up mymindsince yesterdayto leave this place i shall take the train atnoon</s> it was not to gratify olive chancellor that he had determined to goaway or even that he told her this yet he was surprised that his wordsbrought no expression of pleasure to her face</s>  i dont think it is ofmuch importance whether you go away or not</s>  miss tarrant herself hasgone away</s> miss tarrantgone away</s>  this announcement was so much at variancewith verenas apparent intentions the night before that his ejaculationexpressed chagrin as well as surprise and in doing so it gave olive amomentary advantage</s>  it was the only one she had ever had and the poorgirl may be excused for having enjoyed itso far as enjoyment waspossible to her</s>  basil ransoms visible discomfiture was more agreeableto her than anything had been for a long time</s> i went with her myself to the early train and i saw it leave thestation</s>  and olive kept her eyes unaverted for the satisfaction ofseeing how he took it</s> it must be confessed that he took it rather ill</s>  he had decided it wasbest he should retire but verenas retiring was another matter</s>  andwhere is she gone</s>  he asked with a frown</s> i dont think i am obliged to tell you</s> of course not</s>  excuse my asking</s>  it is much better that i should findit out for myself because if i owed the information to you i shouldperhaps feel a certain delicacy as regards profiting by it</s> gracious heaven</s>  cried miss chancellor at the idea of ransomsdelicacy</s>  then she added more deliberately you will not find out foryourself</s> you think not</s> i am sure of it</s>  and her enjoyment of the situation becoming acutethere broke from her lips a shrill unfamiliar troubled sound whichperformed the office of a laugh a laugh of triumph but which at adistance might have passed almost as well for a wail of despair</s>  itrang in ransoms ears as he quickly turned away</s> xlit was mrs</s>  luna who received him as she had received him on theoccasion of his first visit to charles street by which i do not meanquite in the same way</s>  she had known very little about him then but sheknew too much for her happiness today and she had with him now alittle invidious contemptuous manner as if everything he should say ordo could be a proof only of abominable duplicity and perversity</s>  she hada theory that he had treated her shamefully and he knew iti do notmean the fact but the theory which led him to reflect that herresentments were as shallow as her opinions inasmuch as if she reallybelieved in her grievance or if it had had any dignity she would nothave consented to see him</s>  he had not presented himself at misschancellors door without a very good reason and having done so hecould not turn away so long as there was any one in the house of whom hemight have speech</s>  he had sent up his name to mrs</s>  luna after beingtold that she was staying there on the mere chance that she would seehim for he thought a refusal a very possible sequel to the letters shehad written him during the past four or five monthsletters he hadscarcely read full of allusions of the most cutting sort to proceedingsof his in the past of which he had no recollection whatever</s>  theybored him for he had quite other matters in his mind</s> i dont wonder you have the bad taste the crudity she said as soonas he came into the room looking at him more sternly than he would havebelieved possible to her</s> he saw that this was an allusion to his not having been to see her sincethe period of her sisters visit to new york he having conceived forher the evening of mrs</s>  burrages party a sentiment of aversion whichput an end to such attentions</s>  he didnt laugh he was too worried andpreoccupied but he replied in a tone which apparently annoyed her asmuch as any indecent mirth i thought it very possible you wouldnt seeme</s> why shouldnt i see you if i should take it into my head</s>  do yousuppose i care whether i see you or not</s> i supposed you wanted to from your letters</s> then why did you think i would refuse</s> because thats the sort of thing women do</s> womenwomen</s>  you know much about

with asadness which mrs</s>  luna evidently regarded as a refinement of outrage</s> what i should like to ascertain is where miss tarrant may be found atthe present moment</s> and do you think thats a delicate inquiry to make of me</s> i dont see why it shouldnt be but i know you dont think it is andthat is why as i say i mention the matter to you only because i canimagine absolutely no one else

little over her shoulder at him and her eyesfixed as unsympathetically as possible upon his own</s>  what you proposethen as i understand it she said in a moment is that i shouldbetray my sister to you</s> worse than that i propose that you should betray miss tarrantherself</s> what do i care about miss tarrant</s>  i dont know what you are talkingabout</s> havent you really any idea where she

look here basil ransom i neverthought you were a fool but it strikes me that since we last met youhave lost your wits</s> there is no doubt of that ransom answered smiling</s> do you mean to tell me you dont know everything about miss tarrantthat can be known</s> i have neither seen her nor heard of her for the last ten weeks misschancellor has hidden her away</s> hidden her away with all the walls and fences of boston flaming todaywith her name</s> oh yes i have noticed that and i have no doubt that by waiting tillthis evening i shall be able to see her</s>  but i dont want to wait tillthis evening i want to see her now and not in publicin private</s> do you indeed</s> how interesting</s>  cried mrs</s>  luna with ripplinglaughter</s>  and pray what do you want to do with her</s> ransom hesitated a little</s>  i think i would rather not tell you</s> your charming frankness then has its limits</s>  my poor cousin you arereally too naf</s>  do you suppose it matters a straw to me</s> ransom made no answer to this appeal but after an instant he broke outhonestly mrs</s>  luna can you give me no clue</s> lord what terrible eyes you make and what terrible words you use</s> honestly quoth he</s>  do you think i am so fond of the creature that iwant to keep her all to myself</s> i dont know i dont understand said ransom slowly and softly butstill with his terrible

a girl of that class</s> i havent been jilted</s>  i like her very much but she never encouragedme</s> at this mrs</s>  luna broke again into articulate scoffing</s>  it is very oddthat at your age you should be so little a man of the world</s> ransom made her no other answer than to remark thoughtfully and ratherabsently your sister is really very clever</s>
by which you mean i suppose that i am not</s>  mrs</s>
 luna suddenlychanged her tone and said with the greatest sweetness and humilitygod knows i have never pretended to be</s> ransom looked at her a moment and guessed the meaning of this alterednote</s>  it had suddenly come over her that with her portrait in half theshopfronts her advertisement on all the fences and the great occasionon which she was to reveal herself to the country at large close athand verena had become so conscious of high destinies that her dearfriends southern kinsman really appeared to her very small game andshe might therefore be regarded as having cast him off</s>  if this were thecase it would perhaps be well for mrs</s>  luna still to hold on</s>  basilsinduction was very rapid but it gave him time to decide that the bestthing to say to his interlocutress was on what day do you sail foreurope</s> perhaps i shall not sail at all mrs</s>  luna replied looking out of thewindow</s> and in that casepoor newtons education</s> i should try to content myself with a country which has given youyours</s> dont you want him then to be a man of the world</s> ah the world the world</s>  she murmured while she watched in thedeepening dusk the lights of the town begin to reflect themselves inthe back bay</s>
perhaps after all i shall be able to go to florence</s>  said ransomlaughing</s> she faced him once more this time slowly and declared that she hadnever known anything so strange as his state of

fifthrate poseuse and insuch a frenzy to get hold of her</s>  he might say it was none of herbusiness and of course she would have no answer to that therefore sheadmitted that she asked simply out of intellectual curiosity andbecause one always was tormented at the sight of a painfulcontradiction</s>  with the things she had heard him say about hisconvictions and theories his view of life and the great questions ofthe future she should have thought he would find miss tarrantsattitudinising absolutely nauseous</s>  were not her views the same asolives and hadnt olive and he signally failed to hit it off together</s> mrs</s>  luna only asked because she was really quite puzzled</s>  dont youknow that some minds when they see a mystery cant rest till theyclear it up</s> you cant be more puzzled than i am said ransom</s>  apparently theexplanation is to be found in a sort of reversal of the formula you wereso good just now as to apply to me</s>  you like my opinions but youentertain a different sentiment for my character</s>  i deplore misstarrants opinions but her characterwell her character pleases me</s> mrs</s>  luna stared as if she were waiting the explanation surely notbeing

mrs</s>  luna exclaimedaudibly enough and without moving from her place she bent anuncharitable eye upon the invader a gentleman whom ransom had the senseof having met before</s>  he was a young man

immensely advertisedgazed down the vista the approach for pedestrians which leads out ofschool street and thought it looked expectant and ominous</s>  people hadnot begun to enter yet but the place was ready lighted and open andthe interval would be only too short</s>  so it appeared to ransom while atthe same time he wished immensely the crisis were over</s>  everything thatsurrounded him referred itself to the idea with which his mind waspalpitating the question whether he might not still intervene asagainst the girls jump into the abyss</s>  he believed that all boston wasgoing to hear her or that at least every one was whom he saw in thestreets and there was a kind of incentive and inspiration in thisthought</s>  the vision of wresting her from the mighty multitude set himoff again to stride through the population that would fight for her</s>  itwas not too late for he felt strong it would not be too late even ifshe should already stand there before thousands of converging eyes</s>  hehad had his ticket since the morning and now the time was going on</s>  hewent back to his hotel at last for ten minutes and refreshed himself bydressing a little and by drinking a glass of wine</s>  then he took his wayonce more to the music hall and saw that people were beginning to gointhe first drops of the great stream among whom there were manywomen</s>  since seven oclock the minutes had moved fastbefore that theyhad draggedand now there was only half an hour</s>  ransom passed in withthe others he knew just where his seat was he had chosen it onreaching boston from the few that were left with what he believed tobe care</s>  but now as he stood beneath the faraway panelled roofstretching above the line of little tongues of flame which marked itsjunction with the walls he felt that this didnt matter much since hecertainly was not going to subside into his place</s>  he was not one of theaudience he was apart unique and had come on a business altogetherspecial</s>  it wouldnt have mattered if in advance he had got no placeat all and had just left himself to pay for standingroom at the last</s> the people came pouring in and in a very short time there would only bestandingroom left</s>  ransom had no definite plan he had mainly wanted toget inside of the building so that on a view of the field he mightmake up his mind</s>  he had never been in the music hall before and itslofty vaults and rows of overhanging balconies made it to hisimagination immense and impressive</s>  there were two or three momentsduring which he felt as he could imagine a young man to feel whowaiting in a public place has made up his mind for reasons of his ownto discharge a pistol at the king or the president</s> the place struck him with a kind of roman vastness the doors whichopened out of the upper balconies high aloft and which were constantlyswinging to and fro with the passage of spectators and ushers remindedhim of the vomitoria that he had read about in descriptions of thecolosseum</s>  the huge organ the background of the stagea stage occupiedwith tiers of seats for choruses and civic worthieslifted to the domeits shining pipes and sculptured pinnacles and some genius of music ororatory erected himself in monumental bronze at the base</s>  the hall wasso capacious and serious and the audience increased so rapidly withoutfilling it giving ransom a sense of the numbers it would contain whenit was packed that the courage of the two young women face to facewith so tremendous an ordeal hovered before him as really sublimeespecially the conscious tension of poor olive who would have beenspared none of the anxieties and tremors none of the previsions ofaccident or calculations of failure</s>  in the front of the stage was aslim high desk like a musicstand with a cover of red velvet andnear it was a light ornamental chair on which he was sure verena wouldnot seat herself though he could fancy her leaning at moments on theback</s>  behind this was a kind of semicircle of a dozen armchairs whichhad evidently been arranged for the friends of the speaker her sponsorsand patrons</s>  the hall was more and more full of premonitory soundspeople making a noise as they unfolded on hinges their seats anditinerant boys whose voices as they cried out photographs of misstarrantsketch of her life</s>  or portraits of the speakerstory of hercareer</s>  sounded small and piping in the general immensity</s>  beforeransom was aware of it several of the armchairs in the row behind thelecturers desk were occupied with gaps and in a moment herecognised even across the interval three of the persons who hadappeared</s>  the straightfeatured woman with bands of glossy hair andeyebrows that told at a distance could only be mrs</s>  farrinder just asthe gentleman beside her in a white overcoat with an umbrella and avague face was probably her husband amariah</s>  at the opposite end of therow were another pair whom ransom unacquainted with certain chaptersof verenas history perceived without surprise to be mrs</s>  burrage andher insinuating son</s>  apparently their interest in miss tarrant was morethan a momentary fad sincelike himselfthey had made the journeyfrom new york to hear her</s>  there were other figures unknown to ouryoung man here and there in the semicircle but several places werestill empty one of which was of course reserved for olive and itoccurred to ransom even in his preoccupation that one of them ought toremain soought to be left to symbolise the presence in the spirit ofmiss birdseye</s> he bought one of the photographs of verena and thought it shockinglybad and bought also the sketch of her life which many people seemed tobe reading but crumpled it up in his pocket for future consideration</s> verena was not in the least present to him in connexion with thisexhibition of enterprise and puffery what he saw was olive strugglingand yielding making every sacrifice of taste for the sake of thelargest hearing and conforming herself to a great popular system</s> whether she had struggled or not there was a catchpenny effect aboutthe whole thing which added to the fever in his cheek and made him wishhe had money to buy up the stock of the vociferous little boys</s>  suddenlythe notes of the organ rolled out into the hall and he became awarethat the overture or prelude had begun</s>  this too seemed to him a pieceof claptrap but he didnt wait to think of it he instantly edged outof his place which he had chosen near the end of a row and reached oneof the numerous doors</s>  if he had had no definite plan he now had atleast an irresistible impulse and he felt the prick of shame at havingfaltered for a moment</s>  it had been his tacit calculation that verenastill enshrined in mystery by her companion would not have reached thescene of her performance till within a few minutes of the time at whichshe was to come forth so that he had lost nothing by waiting up tothis moment before the platform</s>  but now he must overtake hisopportunity</s>  before passing out of the hall into the lobby he pausedand with his back to the stage gave a look at the gathered auditory</s>  ithad become densely numerous and suffused with the evenly distributedgaslight which fell from a great elevation and the thick atmospherethat hangs for ever in such places it appeared to pile itself high andto look dimly expectant and formidable</s>  he had a throb of uneasiness athis private purpose of balking it of its entertainment its victimaglimpse of the ferocity that lurks in a disappointed mob</s>  but thethought of that danger only made him pass more quickly through the uglycorridors he felt that his plan was definite enough now and he foundthat he had no need even of asking the way to a certain small door oneor more of them which he meant to push open</s>  in taking his place inthe morning he had assured himself as to the side of the house on whichwith its approach to the platform the withdrawing room of singers andspeakers was situated he had chosen his seat in that quarter and henow had not far to go before he reached it</s>  no one heeded or challengedhim miss tarrants auditors were still pouring in the occasion wasevidently to have been an unprecedented success of curiosity and hadall the attention of the ushers</s>  ransom opened a door at the end of thepassage and it admitted him into a sort of vestibule quite bare savethat at a second door opposite to him stood a figure at the sight ofwhich he paused for a moment in his advance</s> the figure was simply that of a robust policeman in his helmet andbrass buttonsa policeman who was expecting himransom could see thatin a twinkling</s>  he judged in the same space of time that olivechancellor had heard of his having arrived and had applied for theprotection of this functionary who was now simply guarding the ingressand was prepared to defend it against all comers</s>  there was a slightelement of surprise in this as he had reasoned that his nervouskinswoman was absent from her house for the dayhad been spending itall in verenas retreat wherever that was</s>  the surprise was not greatenough however to interrupt his course for more than an instant andhe crossed the room and stood before the belted sentinel</s>  for a momentneither spoke they looked at each other very hard in the eyes andransom heard the organ beyond partitions launching its waves of soundthrough the hall</s>  they seemed to be very near it and the whole placevibrated</s>  the policeman was a tall leanfaced sallow man with a stoopof the shoulders a small steady eye and something in his mouth whichmade a protuberance in his cheek</s>  ransom could see that he was verystrong but he believed that he himself was not materially less so</s> however he had not come there to show physical fighta public tussleabout verena was not an attractive idea except perhaps after all ifhe should get the worst of it from the point of view of olives newsystem of advertising and moreover it would not be in the leastnecessary</s>
 still he said nothing and still the policeman remained dumband there was something in the way the moments elapsed and in our youngmans consciousness that verena was separated from him only by a coupleof thin planks which made him feel that she too expected him but inanother sense that she had nothing to do with this parade ofresistance that she would know in a moment by quick intuition that hewas there and that she was only praying to be rescued to be saved</s> face to face with olive she hadnt the courage but she would have itwith her hand in his</s>  it came to him that there was no one in the worldless sure of her business just at that moment than olive chancellor itwas as if he could see through the door the terrible way her eyes werefixed on verena while she held her watch in her hand and verena lookedaway from her</s>  olive would have been so thankful that she should beginbefore the hour but of course that was impossible</s>  ransom asked noquestionsthat seemed a waste of time he only said after a minute tothe policemani should like very much to see miss tarrant if you will be so good asto take in my card</s> the guardian of order well planted just between him and the handle ofthe door took from ransom the morsel of pasteboard which he held out tohim read slowly the name inscribed on it turned it over and looked atthe back then returned it to his interlocutor</s>  well i guess it aintmuch use he remarked</s> how can you know that</s>  you have no business to decline my request</s> well i guess i have about as much business as you have to make it</s> then he added you are just the very man she wants to keep out</s> i dont think miss tarrant wants to keep me out ransom returned</s> i dont know much about her she hasnt hired the hall</s>  its the otheronemiss chancellor its her that runs this lecture</s> and she has asked you to keep me out</s>  how absurd</s>  exclaimed ransomingeniously</s> she tells me youre none too fit to be round alone you have got thisthing on the brain</s>  i guess youd better be quiet said the policeman</s> quiet</s>  is it possible to be more quiet than i am</s> well ive seen crazy folks that were a good deal like you</s>  if you wantto see the speaker why dont you go and set round in the hall with therest of the public</s>  and the policeman waited in an immovableruminating reasonable manner for an answer to this inquiry</s> ransom had one on the instant at his service</s>  because i dont wantsimply to see her i want also to speak to herin private</s> yesits always intensely private said the policeman</s>  now iwouldnt lose the lecture if i was you</s>  i guess it will do you good</s> the lecture</s>  ransom repeated laughing</s>  it wont take place</s> yes it willas quick as the organ stops</s>  then the policeman added asto himself why the devil dont it</s> because miss tarrant has sent up to the organist to tell him to keepon</s> who has she sent do you spose</s>  and ransoms new acquaintance enteredinto his humour</s>  i guess miss chancellor isnt her nigger</s> she has sent her father or perhaps even her mother</s>  they are in theretoo</s> how do you know that</s>  asked the policeman consideringly</s> oh i know everything ransom answered smiling</s> well i guess they didnt come here to listen to that organ</s>  well hearsomething else before long if he doesnt stop</s> you will hear a good deal very soon ransom remarked</s> the serenity of his selfconfidence appeared at last to make animpression on his antagonist who lowered his head a little like somebutting animal and looked at the young man from beneath bushy eyebrows</s> well i have heard a good deal since ive been in boston</s> oh bostons a great place ransom rejoined inattentively</s>  he was notlistening to the policeman or to the organ now for the sound of voiceshad reached him from the other side of the door</s>  the policeman took nofurther notice of it than to lean back against the panels with foldedarms and there was another pause between them during which theplaying of the organ ceased</s> i will just wait here with your permission said ransom andpresently i shall be called</s> who do you spose will call you</s> well miss tarrant i hope</s> shell have to square the other one first</s> ransom took out his watch which he had adapted on purpose severalhours before to boston time and saw that the minutes had sped withincreasing velocity during this interview and that it now marked fiveminutes past eight</s>  miss chancellor will have to square the public hesaid in a moment and the words were far from being an empty professionof security for the conviction already in possession of him that adrama in which he though cut off was an actor had been going on forsome time in the apartment he was prevented from entering that thesituation was extraordinarily strained there and that it could not cometo an end without an appeal to himthis transcendental assumptionacquired an infinitely greater force the instant he perceived thatverena was even now keeping her audience waiting</s>  why didnt she go on</s> why except that she knew he was there and was gaining time</s> well i guess she has shown herself said the doorkeeper whosediscussion with ransom now appeared to have passed on his own part andwithout the slightest prejudice to his firmness into a sociablegossiping phase</s> if she had shown herself we should hear the reception the applause</s> well there they air they are going to give it to her the policemanannounced</s> he had an odious appearance of being in the right for there indeed theyseemed to bethey were giving it to her</s>  a general hubbub rose from thefloor and the galleries of the hallthe sound of several thousandpeople stamping with their feet and rapping with their umbrellas andsticks</s>  ransom felt faint and for a little while he stood with his gazeinterlocked with that of the policeman</s>  then suddenly a wave of coolnessseemed to break over him and he exclaimed my dear fellow that isntapplauseits impatience</s>  it isnt a reception its a call</s> the policeman neither assented to this proposition nor denied it heonly transferred the protuberance in his cheek to the other side andobservedi guess shes sick</s> oh i hope not</s>  said ransom very gently</s>  the stamping and rappingswelled and swelled for a minute and then it subsided but before ithad done so ransoms definition of it had plainly become the true one</s> the tone of the manifestation was goodhumoured but it was notgratulatory</s>  he looked at his watch again and saw that five minutesmore had elapsed and he remembered what the newspaperman in charlesstreet had said about olives guaranteeing verenas punctuality</s>  oddlyenough at the moment the image of this gentleman recurred to him thegentleman himself burst through the other door in a state of theliveliest agitation</s> why in the name of goodness dont she go on</s>  if she wants to make themcall her theyve done it about enough</s>  mr</s>  pardon turned pressinglyfrom ransom to the policeman and back again and in his preoccupationgave no sign of having met the mississippian before</s> i guess shes sick said the policeman</s> the publicll be sick</s>  cried the distressed reporter</s>  if shes sickwhy doesnt she send for a doctor</s>  all boston is packed into this houseand she has got to talk to it</s>  i want to go in and see</s> you cant go in said the policeman drily</s> why cant i go in i should like to know</s>  i want to go in for thevesper</s> you cant go in for anything</s>  im keeping this man out too thepoliceman added genially as if to make mr</s>  pardons exclusion appearless invidious</s> why theyd ought to let you in said matthias staring a moment atransom</s> may be theyd ought but they wont the policeman remarked</s> gracious me</s>  panted mr</s>  pardon i knew from the first miss

the policeman</s> well hell have to give it back if he dont look out</s> maybe he will</s>  ill let him in if he comes but hes the only one</s> she is on now the policeman added without emotion</s> his ear had caught the first faint murmur of another explosion of sound</s> this time unmistakably it was applausethe clapping of multitudinoushands mingled with the noise of many throats</s>  the demonstrationhowever though considerable was not what might have been expected andit died away quickly</s>  mr</s>  pardon stood listening with an expression ofsome alarm</s>  merciful fathers</s>  cant they give her more than that</s>  hecried</s>  ill just fly round and see</s> when he had hurried away again ransom said to the policemanwho ismr</s>  filer</s> oh hes an old friend of mine</s>  hes the man that runs misschancellor</s> that runs her</s> just the same as she runs miss tarrant</s>  he runs the pair as you mightsay</s>  hes in the lecturebusiness</s> then he had better talk to the public himself</s> oh he cant talk he can only boss</s> the opposite door at this moment was pushed open again and a largeheatedlooking man with a little stiff beard on the end of his chin andhis overcoat flying behind him strode forward with an imprecation</s> what the h are they doing in the parlour</s>  this sort of thingsabout played out</s> aint she up there now</s>  the policeman asked</s> its not miss tarrant ransom said as if he knew all about it</s>  heperceived in a moment that this was mr</s>  filer olive chancellors agentan inference instantly followed by the reflexion that such a personagewould have been warned against him by his kinswoman and would doubtlessattempt to hold him or his influence accountable for verenasunexpected delay</s>  mr</s>  filer only glanced at him however and toransoms surprise appeared to have no theory of his identity a factimplying that miss chancellor had considered that the greater discretionwas except to the policeman to hold her tongue about him altogether</s> up there</s>  its her jackass of a father thats up there</s>  cried mr</s> filer with his hand on the latch of the door which the policeman hadallowed him to approach</s> is he asking for a doctor</s>  the latter inquired dispassionately</s> youre the sort of doctor hell want if he doesnt produce the girl</s> you dont mean to say theyve locked themselves

handle</s> if the door was locked what was the good of your standing before it</s> ransom inquired</s> so as you couldnt do that and the policeman nodded at mr</s>  filer</s> you see your interference has done very little good</s> i dunno she has got to come out yet</s> mr</s>  filer meanwhile had continued to thump and shake demanding instantadmission and inquiring if they were going to let the audience pull thehouse down</s>  another round of applause had broken out directedperceptibly to some apology some solemn circumlocution of selahtarrants this covered the sound of the agents voice as

says shes just a little faintfrom nervousness</s>  shell be allready in about three minutes</s>  this announcement was mr</s>  pardonscontribution to the crisis and he added that the crowd was a

within</s>  verena stood thereit was she evidently who hadopened itand her eyes went straight to his</s>  she was dressed in whiteand her face was whiter than her garment above it her hair seemed

on the platform</s> cried mr</s>  filer making with both his arms a movement as if to sweep herbefore him through the waitingroom up into the presence of thepublic</s> in a moment i shall be ready</s>  my father is making that all right</s>  andto ransoms surprise she smiled with all her sweetness at theirrepressible agent appeared to wish genuinely to reassure him</s> the three had moved together into the waitingroom and there at thefarther end of it beyond the vulgar perfunctory chairs and tablesunder the flaring gas he saw mrs</s>  tarrant sitting upright on a sofawith immense rigidity and a large flushed visage full of suppresseddistortion and beside her prostrate fallen over her head buried inthe lap of verenas mother the tragic figure of olive chancellor</s> ransom could scarcely know how much olives having flung herself uponmrs</s>  tarrants bosom testified to the convulsive scene that had justtaken place behind the locked door</s>  he closed it again sharply in theface of the reporter and the policeman and at the same moment selahtarrant descended through the aperture leading to the platform fromhis brief communion with the public</s>  on seeing ransom he stopped shortand gathering his waterproof about him measured the young man fromhead to foot</s> well sir perhaps you would like to go and explain our hitch heremarked indulging in a smile so comprehensive that the

ransom</s>  cried the exasperated bewildered filer</s> verena spoke to the others but she looked at her lover and theexpression of her eyes was ineffably touching and beseeching</s>  shetrembled with nervous passion there were sobs and supplications in hervoice and ransom felt himself flushing with pure pity for her painherinevitable agony</s>  but at the same moment he had another perceptionwhich brushed aside remorse he saw that he could do what he wantedthat she begged him with all her being to spare her but that so longas he should protest she was submissive helpless</s>  what he wanted inthis light flamed before him and challenged all his manhood tossinghis determination to a height from which not only doctor tarrant andmr</s>  filer and olive over there in her sightless soundless
