the victorian age in literatureintroductiona section of a long and splendid literature can be most convenientlytreated in one of two ways</s>  it can be divided as one cuts a currant cakeor a gruyre cheese taking the currants or the holes as they come</s>  orit can be divided as one cuts woodalong the grain if one thinks thatthere is a grain</s>  but the two are never the same the names never comein the same order in actual time as they come in any serious study of aspirit or a tendency</s>  the critic who wishes to move onward with the lifeof an epoch must be always running backwards and forwards among itsmere dates just as a branch bends back and forth continually yet thegrain in the branch runs true like an unbroken river</s> mere chronological order indeed is almost as arbitrary as alphabeticalorder</s>  to deal with darwin dickens browning in the sequence of thebirthday book would be to forge about as real a chain as the tacitustolstoy tupper of a biographical dictionary</s>  it might lend itselfmore perhaps to accuracy and it might satisfy that school of criticswho hold that every artist should be treated as a solitary craftsmanindifferent to the commonwealth and unconcerned about moral things</s>  towrite on that principle in the present case however would involve allthose delicate difficulties known to politicians which beset thepublic defence of a doctrine which one heartily disbelieves</s>  it is quiteneedless here to go into the old art for arts sakebusiness orexplain at length why individual artists cannot be reviewed withoutreference to their traditions and creeds</s>  it is enough to say that withother creeds they would have been for literary purposes otherindividuals</s>  their views do not of course make the brains in theirheads any more than the ink in their pens</s>  but it is equally evidentthat mere brainpower without attributes or aims a wheel revolving inthe void would be a subject about as entertaining as ink</s>  the moment wedifferentiate the minds we must differentiate by doctrines and moralsentiments</s>  a mere sympathy for democratic merrymaking and mourningwill not make a man a writer like dickens</s>  but without that sympathydickens would not be a writer like dickens and probably not a writer atall</s>  a mere conviction that catholic thought is the clearest as well asthe best disciplined will not make a man a writer like newman</s>  butwithout that conviction newman would not be a writer like newman andprobably not a writer at all</s>  it is useless for the sthete or anyother anarchist to urge the isolated individuality of the artist apartfrom his attitude to his age</s>  his attitude to his age is hisindividuality men are never individual when alone</s> it only remains for me therefore to take the more delicate andentangled task and deal with the great victorians not only by datesand names but rather by schools and streams of thought</s>  it is a taskfor which i feel myself wholly incompetent but as that applies to everyother literary enterprise i ever went in for the sensation is notwholly novel indeed it is rather reassuring than otherwise to realisethat i am now doing something that nobody could do properly</s>  the chiefperil of the process however will be an inevitable tendency to makethe spiritual landscape too large for the figures</s>  i must ask forindulgence if such criticism traces too far back into politics or ethicsthe roots of which great books were the blossoms makes utilitarianismmore important than liberty or talks more of the oxford movement thanof the christian year</s>  i can only answer in the very temper of theage of which i write for i also was born a victorian and sympathisenot a little with the serious victorian spirit</s>  i can only answer ishall not make religion more important than it was to keble or politicsmore sacred than they were to mill</s> chapter ithe victorian compromise and its enemiesthe previous literary life of this country had left vigorous many oldforces in the victorian time as in our time</s>  roman britain and medivalengland are still not only alive but lively for real development is notleaving things behind as on a road but drawing life from them as froma root</s>  even when we improve we never progress</s>  for progress themetaphor from the road implies a man leaving his home behind him butimprovement means a man exalting the towers or extending the gardens ofhis home</s>  the ancient english literature was like all the severalliteratures of christendom alike in its likeness alike in its veryunlikeness</s>  like all european cultures it was european like alleuropean cultures it was something more than european</s>  a most markedand unmanageable national temperament is plain in chaucer and theballads of robin hood in spite of deep and sometimes disastrous changesof national policy that note is still unmistakable in shakespeare injohnson and his friends in cobbett in dickens</s>  it is vain to dream ofdefining such vivid things a national soul is as indefinable as asmell and as unmistakable</s>  i remember a friend who tried impatiently toexplain the word mistletoe to a german and cried at last despairingwell you know hollymistletoes the opposite</s>  i do not commend thislogical method in the comparison of plants or nations</s>  but if he hadsaid to the teuton well you know germanyenglands theoppositethe definition though fallacious would not have been whollyfalse</s>  england like all christian countries absorbed valuable elementsfrom the forests and the rude romanticism of the north but like allchristian countries it drank its longest literary draughts from theclassic fountains of the ancients nor was this as is so often looselythought a matter of the mere renaissance</s>  the english tongue andtalent of speech did not merely flower suddenly into the gargantuanpolysyllables of the great elizabethans it had always been full of thepopular latin of the middle ages</s>  but whatever balance of blood andracial idiom one allows it is really true that the only suggestion thatgets near the englishman is to hint how far he is from the german</s>  thegermans like the welsh can sing perfectly serious songs perfectlyseriously in chorus can with clear eyes and clear voices join togetherin words of innocent and beautiful personal passion for a false maidenor a dead child</s>  the nearest one can get to defining the poetic temperof englishmen is to say that they couldnt do this even for beer</s>  theycan sing in chorus and louder than other christians but they must havein their songs something i know not what that is at once shamefacedand rowdy</s>  if the matter be emotional it must somehow be also broadcommon and comic as wapping old stairs and sally in our alley</s>  ifit be patriotic it must somehow be openly bombastic and as it wereindefensible like rule britannia or like that superb song i neverknew its name if it has one that records the number of leagues fromushant to the scilly isles</s>  also there is a tender lovelyric called otarry trousers which is even more english than the heart of themidsummer nights dream</s>  but our greatest bards and sages have oftenshown a tendency to rant it and roar it like true british sailors toemploy an extravagance that is half conscious and therefore halfhumorous</s>  compare for example the rants of shakespeare with the rantsof victor hugo</s>  a piece of hugos eloquence is either a serious triumphor a serious collapse one feels the poet is offended at a smile</s>  butshakespeare seems rather proud of talking nonsense i never can readthat rousing and mounting description of the storm where it comes to who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafening clamour in the slippery clouds</s> without seeing an immense balloon rising from the ground withshakespeare grinning over the edge of the car and saying you cantstop me i am above reason now</s>  that is the nearest we can get to thegeneral national spirit which we have now to follow through one briefand curious but very national episode</s> three years before the young queen was crowned william cobbett wasburied at farnham</s>  it may seem strange to begin with this greatneglected name rather than the old age of wordsworth or the young deathof shelley</s>  but to any one who feels literature as human the emptychair of cobbett is more solemn and significant than the throne</s>  withhim died the sort of democracy that was a return to nature and whichonly poets and mobs can understand</s>  after him radicalism is urbanandtoryism suburban</s>  going through green warwickshire cobbett might havethought of the crops and shelley of the clouds</s>  but shelley would havecalled birmingham what cobbett called ita hellhole</s>
 cobbett was onewith after liberals in the ideal of man under an equal law a citizen ofno mean city</s>  he differed from after liberals in strongly affirming thatliverpool and leeds are mean cities</s>
it is no idle hibernianism to say that towards the end of the eighteenthcentury the most important event in english history happened in france</s> it would seem still more perverse yet it would be still more preciseto say that the most important event in english history was the eventthat never happened at allthe english revolution on the lines of thefrench revolution</s>  its failure was not due to any lack of fervour oreven ferocity in those who would have brought it about from the timewhen the first shout went up for wilkes to the time when the lastluddite fires were quenched in a cold rain of rationalism the spirit ofcobbett of rural republicanism of english and patriotic democracyburned like a beacon</s>  the revolution failed because it was foiled byanother revolution an aristocratic revolution a victory of the richover the poor</s>  it was about this time that the common lands were finallyenclosed that the more cruel game laws were first established thatengland became finally a land of landlords instead of commonlandowners</s>  i will not call it a tory reaction for much of the worstof it especially of the landgrabbing was done by whigs but we maycertainly call it antijacobin</s>  now this fact though political is notonly relevant but essential to everything that concerned literature</s>  theupshot was that though england was full of the revolutionary ideasnevertheless there was no revolution</s>  and the effect of this in turn wasthat from the middle of the eighteenth century to the middle of thenineteenth the spirit of revolt in england took a wholly literary form</s> in france it was what people did that was wild and elemental in englandit was what people wrote</s>  it is a quaint comment on the notion that theenglish are practical and the french merely visionary that we wererebels in arts while they were rebels in arms</s> it has been well and wittily said as illustrating the mildness ofenglish and the violence of french developments that the same gospel ofrousseau which in france produced the terror in england producedsandford and merton</s>  but people forget that in literature the englishwere by no means restrained by mr</s>  barlow and that if we turn frompolitics to art we shall find the two parts peculiarly reversed</s>  itwould be equally true to say that the same eighteenthcenturyemancipation which in france produced the pictures of david in englandproduced the pictures of blake</s>  there never were i think men who gaveto the imagination so much of the sense of having broken out into thevery borderlands of being as did the great english poets of theromantic or revolutionary period than coleridge in the secret sunlightof the antarctic where the waters were like witches oils than keatslooking out of those extreme mysterious casements upon that ultimatesea</s>  the heroes and criminals of the great french crisis would have beenquite as incapable of such imaginative independence as keats andcoleridge would have been incapable of winning the battle of wattignies</s> in paris the tree of liberty was a garden tree clipped very correctlyand robespierre used the razor more regularly than the guillotine</s> danton who knew and admired english literature would have cursedfreely over kubla khan and if the committee of public safety had notalready executed shelley as an aristocrat they would certainly havelocked him up for a madman</s>  even hbert the one really vilerevolutionist had he been reproached by english poets with worshippingthe goddess of reason might legitimately have retorted that it wasrather the goddess of unreason that they set up to be worshipped</s> verbally considered carlyles french revolution was morerevolutionary than the real french revolution and if carrier in anexaggerative phrase empurpled the loire with carnage turner almostliterally set the thames on fire</s> this trend of the english romantics to carry out the revolutionary ideanot savagely in works but very wildly indeed in words had severalresults the most important of which was this</s>  it started englishliterature after the revolution with a sort of bent towards independenceand eccentricity which in the brighter wits became individuality andin the duller ones individualism</s>  english romantics english liberalswere not public men making a republic but poets each seeing a vision</s> the lonelier version of liberty was a sort of aristocratic anarchism inbyron and shelley but though in victorian times it faded into muchmilder prejudices and much more bourgeois crotchets england retainedfrom that twist a certain odd separation and privacy</s>  england becamemuch more of an island than she had ever been before</s>  there fell fromher about this time not only the understanding of france or germanybut to her own long and yet lingering disaster the understanding ofireland</s>  she had not joined in the attempt to create european democracynor did she save in the first glow of waterloo join in thecounterattempt to destroy it</s>  the life in her literature was still toa large extent the romantic liberalism of rousseau the free and humanetruisms that had refreshed the other nations the return to nature andto natural rights</s>  but that which in rousseau was a creed became inhazlitt a taste and in lamb little more than a whim</s>  these latter andtheir like form a group at the beginning of the nineteenth century ofthose we may call the eccentrics they gather round coleridge and hisdecaying dreams or linger in the tracks of keats and shelley and godwinlamb with his bibliomania and creed of pure caprice the most unique ofall geniuses leigh hunt with his bohemian impecuniosity landor withhis tempestuous temper throwing plates on the floor hazlitt with hisbitterness and his low love affair even that healthier and happierbohemian peacock</s>  with these in one sense at least goes de quincey</s> he was unlike most of these embers of the revolutionary age in lettersa tory and was attached to the political army which is best representedin letters by the virile laughter and leisure of wilsons noctesambrosian</s>  but he had nothing in common with that environment</s>  itremained for some time as a tory tradition which balanced the cold andbrilliant aristocracy of the whigs</s>  it lived on the legend of trafalgarthe sense that insularity was independence the sense that anomalies areas jolly as family jokes the general sense that old salts are the saltof the earth</s>  it still lives in some old songs about nelson or waterloowhich are vastly more pompous and vastly more sincere than the cockneycocksureness of later jingo lyrics</s>  but it is hard to connect de quinceywith it or indeed with anything else</s>  de quincey would certainly havebeen a happier man and almost certainly a better man if he had gotdrunk on toddy with wilson instead of getting calm and clear as hehimself describes on opium and with no company but a book of germanmetaphysics</s>  but he would hardly have revealed those wonderful vistasand perspectives of prose which permit one to call him the first andmost powerful of the decadents those sentences that lengthen out likenightmare corridors or rise higher and higher like impossible easternpagodas</s>  he was a morbid fellow and far less moral than burns for whenburns confessed excess he did not defend it</s>  but he has cast a giganticshadow on our literature and was as certainly a genius as poe</s>  also hehad humour which poe had not</s>  and if any one still smarting from thepinpricks of wilde or whistler wants to convict them of plagiarism intheir art for art epigramshe will find most of what they said saidbetter in murder as one of the fine arts</s> one great man remains of this elder group who did their last work onlyunder victoria he knew most of the members of it yet he did not belongto it in any corporate sense</s>  he was a poor man and an invalid withscotch blood and a strong though perhaps only inherited quarrel withthe old calvinism by name thomas hood</s>  poverty and illness forced himto the toils of an incessant jester and the revolt against gloomyreligion made him turn his wit whenever he could in the direction ofa defence of happier and humaner views</s>  in the long great roll thatincludes homer and shakespeare he was the last great man who reallyemployed the pun</s>  his puns were not all good nor were shakespearesbut the best of them were a strong and fresh form of art</s>  the pun issaid to be a thing of two meanings but with hood there were threemeanings for there was also the abstract truth that would have beenthere with no pun at all</s>  the pun of hood is underrated like the witof voltaire by those who forget that the words of voltaire were notpins but swords</s>  in hood at his best the verbal neatness only gives tothe satire or the scorn a ring of finality such as is given by rhyme</s> for rhyme does go with reason since the aim of both is to bring thingsto an end</s>  the tragic necessity of puns tautened and hardened hoodsgenius so that there is always a sort of shadow of that sharpnessacross all his serious poems falling like the shadow of a sword</s> sewing at once with a double thread a shroud as well as a shirtwethought her dying when she slept and sleeping when she diedoh godthat bread should be so dear and flesh and blood so cheapnone canfail to note in these a certain fighting discipline of phrase acompactness and point which was well trained in lines like acannonball took off his legs so he laid down his arms</s>  in france hewould have been a great epigrammatist like hugo</s>  in england he is apunster</s> there was nothing at least in this group i have loosely called theeccentrics that disturbs the general sense that all their generation waspart of the sunset of the great revolutionary poets</s>  this fading glamouraffected england in a sentimental and to some extent a snobbishdirection making men feel that great lords with long curls and whiskerswere naturally the wits that led the world</s>  but it affected england alsonegatively and by reaction for it associated such men as byron withsuperiority but not with success</s>  the english middle classes were ledto distrust poetry almost as much as they admired it</s>  they could notbelieve that either vision at the one end or violence at the other couldever be practical</s>  they were deaf to that great warning of hugo yousay the poet is in the clouds but so is the thunderbolt</s>  idealsexhausted themselves in the void victorian england very unwiselywould have no more to do with idealists in politics</s>  and this chieflybecause there had been about these great poets a young and splendidsterility since the pantheist shelley was in fact washed under by thewave of the world or byron sank in death as he drew the sword forhellas</s> the chief turn of nineteenthcentury england was taken about the timewhen a footman at holland house opened a door and announced mr</s> macaulay</s>  macaulays literary popularity was representative and it wasdeserved but his presence among the great whig families marks anepoch</s>  he was the son of one of the first friends of the negro whosehonest industry and philanthropy were darkened by a religion of sombresmugness which almost makes one fancy they loved the negro for hiscolour and would have turned away from red or yellow men as needlesslygaudy</s>  but his wit and his politics combined with that dropping of thepuritan tenets but retention of the puritan tone which marked his classand generation lifted him into a sphere which was utterly opposite tothat from which he came</s>  this whig world was exclusive but it was notnarrow</s>  it was very difficult for an outsider to get into it but if hedid get into it he was in a much freer atmosphere than any other inengland</s>  of those aristocrats the old guard of the eighteenth centurymany denied god many defended bonaparte and nearly all sneered at theroyal family</s>  nor did wealth or birth make any barriers for those oncewithin this singular whig world</s>  the platform was high but it waslevel</s>  moreover the upstart nowadays pushes himself by wealth but thewhigs could choose their upstarts</s>  in that world macaulay found rogerswith his phosphorescent and corpselike brilliancy there he foundsydney smith bursting with crackers of common sense an admirable oldheathen there he found tom moore the romantic of the regency ashortened shadow of lord byron</s>  that he reached this platform andremained on it is i say typical of a turningpoint in the century</s>  forthe fundamental fact of early victorian history was this the decisionof the middle classes to employ their new wealth in backing up a sort ofaristocratical compromise and not like the middle class in the frenchrevolution insisting on a clean sweep and a clear democratic programme</s> it went along with the decision of the aristocracy to recruit itselfmore freely from the middle class</s>  it was then also that victorianprudery began the great lords yielded on this as on free trade</s> these two decisions have made the doubtful england of today andmacaulay is typical of them he is the bourgeois in belgravia</s>  thealliance is marked by his great speeches for lord greys reform bill itis marked even more significantly in his speech against the chartists</s> cobbett was dead</s> macaulay makes the foundation of the victorian age in all its veryenglish and unique elements its praise of puritan politics andabandonment of puritan theology its belief in a cautious but perpetualpatching up of the constitution its admiration for industrial wealth</s> but above all he typifies the two things that really make the victorianage itself the cheapness and narrowness of its conscious formul therichness and humanity of its unconscious tradition</s>  there were twomacaulays a rational macaulay who was generally wrong and a romanticmacaulay who was almost invariably right</s>  all that was small in himderives from the dull parliamentarism of men like sir james mackintoshbut all that was great in him has much more kinship with the festiveantiquarianism of sir walter scott</s> as a philosopher he had only two thoughts and neither of them is true</s> the first was that politics as an experimental science must go onimproving along with clocks pistols or penknives by the mereaccumulation of experiment and variety</s>  he was indeed far toostrongminded a man to accept the hazy modern notion that the soul inits highest sense can change he seems to have held that religion cannever get any better and that poetry rather tends to get worse</s>  but hedid not see the flaw in his political theory which is that unless thesoul improves with time there is no guarantee that the accumulations ofexperience will be adequately used</s>  figures do not add themselves upbirds do not label or stuff themselves comets do not calculate theirown courses these things are done by the soul of man</s>  and if the soulof man is subject to other laws is liable to sin to sleep toanarchism or to suicide then all sciences including politics may fallas sterile and lie as fallow as before mans reason was made</s>  macaulayseemed sometimes to talk as if clocks produced clocks or guns hadfamilies of little pistols or a penknife littered like a pig</s>  the otherview he held was the more or less utilitarian theory of toleration thatwe should get the best butcher whether he was a baptist or amuggletonian and the best soldier whether he was a wesleyan or anirvingite</s>  the compromise worked well enough in an england protestant inbulk but macaulay ought to have seen that it has its limitations</s>  agood butcher might be a baptist he is not very likely to be a buddhist</s> a good soldier might be a wesleyan he would hardly be a quaker</s>  for therest macaulay was concerned to interpret the seventeenth century interms of the triumph of the whigs as champions of public rights and heupheld this onesidedly but not malignantly in a style of rounded andringing sentences which at its best is like steel and at its worst liketin</s> this was the small conscious macaulay the great unconscious macaulaywas very different</s>  his noble enduring quality in our literature isthis that he truly had an abstract passion for history a warm poeticand sincere enthusiasm for great things as such an ardour and appetitefor great books great battles great cities great men</s>  he felt andused names like trumpets</s>  the readers greatest joy is in the writersown joy when he can let his last phrase fall like a hammer on someresounding name like hildebrand or charlemagne on the eagles of rome orthe pillars of hercules</s>  as with walter scott some of the best thingsin his prose and poetry are the surnames that he did not make</s>  and it isremarkable to notice that this romance of history so far from makinghim more partial or untrustworthy was the only thing that made himmoderately just</s>  his reason was entirely onesided and fanatical</s>  itwas his imagination that was wellbalanced and broad</s>  he wasmonotonously certain that only whigs were right but it was necessarythat tories should at least be great that his heroes might have foemenworthy of their steel</s>  if there was one thing in the world he hated itwas a high church royalist parson yet when jeremy collier the jacobitepriest raises a real banner all macaulays blood warms with the mereprospect of a fight</s>  it is inspiriting to see how gallantly thesolitary outlaw advances to attack enemies formidable separately andit might have been thought irresistible when combined distributes hisswashing blows right and left among wycherley congreve and vanbrughtreads the wretched durfey down in the dirt beneath his feet andstrikes with all his strength full at the towering crest of dryden</s> that is exactly where macaulay is great because he is almost homeric</s> the whole triumph turns upon mere names but men are commanded bynames</s>  so his poem on the armada is really a good geography book gonemad one sees the map of england come alive and march and mix under theeye</s> the chief tragedy in the trend of later literature may be expressed bysaying that the smaller macaulay conquered the larger</s>  later men hadless and less of that hot love of history he had inherited from scott</s> they had more and more of that cold science of selfinterests which hehad learnt from bentham</s> the name of this great man though it belongs to a period before thevictorian is like the name of cobbett very important to it</s>  insubstance macaulay accepted the conclusions of bentham though heoffered brilliant objections to all his arguments</s>  in any case the soulof bentham if he had one went marching on like john brown and in thecentral victorian movement it was certainly he who won</s>  john stuart millwas the final flower of that growth</s>  he was himself fresh and delicateand pure but that is the business of a flower</s>  though he had to preacha hard rationalism in religion a hard competition in economics a hardegoism in ethics his own soul had all that silvery sensitiveness thatcan be seen in his fine portrait by watts</s>  he boasted none of thatbrutal optimism with which his friends and followers of the manchesterschool expounded their cheery negations</s>  there was about mill even asort of embarrassment he exhibited all the wheels of his iron universerather reluctantly like a gentleman in trade showing ladies over hisfactory</s>  there shone in him a beautiful reverence for women which isall the more touching because in his department as it were he couldonly offer them so dry a gift as the victorian parliamentary franchise</s> now in trying to describe how the victorian writers stood to each otherwe must recur to the very real difficulty noted at the beginning thedifficulty of keeping the moral order parallel with the chronologicalorder</s>  for the mind moves by instincts associations premonitions andnot by fixed dates or completed processes</s>  action and reaction willoccur simultaneously or the cause actually be found after the effect</s> errors will be resisted before they have been properly promulgatednotions will be first defined long after they are dead</s>  it is no goodgetting the almanac to look up moonshine and most literature in thissense is moonshine</s>  thus wordsworth shrank back into toryism as itwere from a shelleyan extreme of pantheism as yet disembodied</s>  thusnewman took down the iron sword of dogma to parry a blow not yetdelivered that was coming from the club of darwin</s>  for this reason noone can understand tradition or even history who has not sometenderness for anachronism</s> now for the great part of the victorian era the utilitarian traditionwhich reached its highest in mill held the centre of the field it wasthe philosophy in office so to speak</s>  it sustained its march ofcodification and inquiry until it had made possible the great victoriesof darwin and huxley and wallace</s>  if we take macaulay at the beginningof the epoch and huxley at the end of it we shall find that they hadmuch in common</s>  they were both squarejawed simple men greedy ofcontroversy but scornful of sophistry dead to mysticism but very muchalive to morality and they were both very much more under the influenceof their own admirable rhetoric than they knew</s>  huxley especially wasmuch more a literary than a scientific man</s>  it is amusing to note thatwhen huxley was charged with being rhetorical he expressed his horrorof plastering the fair face of truth with that pestilent cosmeticrhetoric which is itself about as wellplastered a piece of rhetoricas ruskin himself could have managed</s>  the difference that the period haddeveloped can best be seen if we consider this that while neither wasof a spiritual sort macaulay took it for granted that common senserequired some kind of theology while huxley took it for granted thatcommon sense meant having none</s>  macaulay it is said never talked abouthis religion but huxley was always talking about the religion he hadntgot</s> but though this simple victorian rationalism held the centre and in acertain sense was the victorian era it was assailed on many sidesand had been assailed even before the beginning of that era</s>  the rest ofthe intellectual history of the time is a series of reactions againstit which come wave after wave</s>  they have succeeded in shaking it butnot in dislodging it from the modern mind</s>  the first of these was theoxford movement a bow that broke when it had let loose the flashingarrow that was newman</s>  the second reaction was one man without teachersor pupilsdickens</s>  the third reaction was a group that tried to createa sort of new romantic protestantism to pit against both reason andromecarlyle ruskin kingsley mauriceperhaps tennyson</s>  browningalso was at once romantic and puritan but he belonged to no group andworked against materialism in a manner entirely his own</s>  though as a boyhe bought eagerly shelleys revolutionary poems he did not think ofbecoming a revolutionary poet</s>  he concentrated on the special souls ofmen seeking god in a series of private interviews</s>  hence browninggreat as he is is rather one of the victorian novelists than wholly ofthe victorian poets</s>  from ruskin again descend those who may be calledthe preraphaelites of prose and poetry</s> it is really with this rationalism triumphant and with the romance ofthese various attacks on it that the study of victorian literaturebegins and proceeds</s>  bentham was already the prophet of a powerful sectmacaulay was already the historian of an historic party before the truevictorian epoch began</s>  the middle classes were emerging in a state ofdamaged puritanism</s>  the upper classes were utterly pagan</s>  their clearand courageous testimony remains in those immortal words of lordmelbourne who had led the young queen to the throne and long stoodthere as her protector</s>  no one has more respect for the christianreligion than i have but really when it comes to intruding it intoprivate life what was pure paganism in the politics of melbournebecame a sort of mystical cynicism in the politics of disraeli and iswell mirrored in his novelsfor he was a man who felt at home inmirrors</s>  with every allowance for aliens and eccentrics and all theaccidents that must always eat the edges of any systematiccircumference it may still be said that the utilitarians held the fort</s> of the oxford movement what remains most strongly in the victorian epochcentres round the challenge of newman its one great literary man</s>  butthe movement as a whole had been of great significance in the verygenesis and make up of the society yet that significance is not quiteeasy immediately to define</s>  it was certainly not sthetic ritualismscarcely one of the oxford high churchmen was what we should call aritualist</s>  it was certainly not a conscious reaching out towards romeexcept on a roman catholic theory which might explain all our unrests bythat dim desire</s>  it knew little of europe it knew nothing of irelandto which any merely roman catholic revulsion would obviously haveturned</s>  in the first instance i think the more it is studied the moreit would appear that it was a movement of mere religion as such</s>  it wasnot so much a taste for catholic dogma but simply a hunger for dogma</s> for dogma means the serious satisfaction of the mind</s>  dogma does notmean the absence of thought but the end of thought</s>  it was a revoltagainst the victorian spirit in one particular aspect of it which mayroughly be called in a cosy and domestic victorian metaphor havingyour cake and eating it too</s>

moslem you were not a bacchanal</s>  if you werea republican you were not a peer</s>  and so the oxford men even in theirfirst and dimmest stages felt that if you were a churchman you were nota

newman announced his return in the arrogantmotto of achilles</s>  but the greater part of all this happened before whatis properly our period and in that period newman and perhaps newmanalone is the expression and summary of the whole school</s>  it wascertainly in the victorian age and after his passage to rome thatnewman claimed his complete right to be in any book on modern englishliterature</s>  this is no place for estimating his theology but one pointabout it does clearly emerge</s>  whatever else is right the theory thatnewman went over to rome to find peace and an end of argument is quiteunquestionably wrong</s>  he had far more quarrels after he had gone over torome</s>  but though he had far more quarrels he had far fewercompromises and he was of that temper which is tortured more bycompromise than by quarrel</s>  he was a man at once of abnormal energy andabnormal sensibility nobody without that combination could have writtenthe apologia</s>  if he sometimes seemed to skin his enemies alive it wasbecause he himself lacked a skin</s>  in this sense his apologia is atriumph far beyond the ephemeral charge on which it was founded in thissense he does indeed to use his own expression vanquish not hisaccuser but his judges</s>  many men would shrink from recording all theircold fits and hesitations and prolonged inconsistencies i am sure itwas the breath of life to newman to confess them now that he had donewith them for ever</s>  his lectures on the present position of englishcatholics practically preached against a raging mob rise not onlyhigher but happier as his instant unpopularity increases</s>  there issomething grander than humour there is fun in the very first lectureabout the british constitution as explained to a meeting of russians</s> but always his triumphs are the triumphs of a highly sensitive man aman must feel insults before he can so insultingly and splendidlyavenge them</s>  he is a naked man who carries a naked sword</s>  the qualityof his literary style is so successful that it succeeds in escapingdefinition</s>  the quality of his logic is that of a long but passionatepatience which waits until he has fixed all corners of an iron trap</s> but the quality of his moral comment on the age remains what i havesaid a protest of the rationality of religion as against the increasingirrationality of mere victorian comfort and compromise</s>  so far as thepresent purpose is concerned his protest died with him he left fewimitators and it may easily be conceived no successful imitators</s>  thesuggestion of him lingers on in the exquisite elizabethan perversity ofcoventry patmore and has later flamed out from the shy volcano offrancis thompson</s>  otherwise as we shall see in the parallel case ofruskins socialism he has no followers in his own age but very many inours</s> the next group of reactionaries or romantics or whatever we elect tocall them gathers roughly around one

forth their fiercest and most extraordinaryenemy</s>  the two primary things in thomas carlyle were his early scotcheducation and his later german culture</s>  the first was in almost allrespects his strength the latter in some respects his weakness</s>  as anordinary lowland peasant he inherited the really valuable historicproperty of the scots their independence their fighting spirit andtheir instinctive philosophic consideration of men merely as men</s>  but hewas not an ordinary peasant</s>  if he had laboured obscurely in his villagetill death he would have been yet locally a marked man

his praise of silenceit was only through his gift of utterance that he escaped madness</s>  butwhile his fellowpeasants would have seen this in him and perhaps mockedit they would also have seen

which i do not mean to refer so much to histranscendental rhapsodies about the worldsoul or the naturegarment orthe mysteries and eternities generally these seem to me to belong moreto his german side

with his rude flattened face robespierre peering mistilythrough his spectacles</s>  he saw the english charge at dunbar</s>  heguessed that mirabeau however dissipated and diseased had somethingsturdy inside him</s>  he guessed that lafayette however brave andvictorious had nothing inside him</s>  he supported the lawlessness ofcromwell because across two centuries he almost physically felt thefeebleness and hopelessness of the moderate parliamentarians</s>  he said aword of sympathy for the universally vituperated jacobins of themountain because through thick veils of national prejudice andmisrepresentation he felt the impossibility of the gironde</s>  he waswrong in denying to scott the power of being inside his characters buthe really had a good deal of that power himself</s>  it was one of hisinnumerable and rather provincial crotchets to encourage prose asagainst poetry</s>  but as a matter of fact he himself was much greaterconsidered as a kind of poet than considered as anything else and thecentral idea of poetry is the idea of guessing right like a child</s> he first emerged as it were as a student and disciple of goethe</s>  theconnection was not wholly fortunate</s>  with much of what goethe reallystood for he was not really in sympathy but in his own obstinate wayhe tried to knock his idol into shape instead of choosing another</s>  hepushed further and further the extravagances of a vivid but veryunbalanced and barbaric style in the praise of a poet who reallyrepresented the calmest classicism and the attempt to restore a hellenicequilibrium in the mind</s>  it is like watching a shaggy scandinaviandecorating a greek statue washed up by chance on his shores</s>  and whilethe strength of goethe was a strength of completion and serenity whichcarlyle not only never found but never even sought the weaknesses ofgoethe were of a sort that did not draw the best out of carlyle</s>  the onecivilised element that the german classicists forgot to put into theirbeautiful balance was a sense of humour</s>  and great poet as goethe wasthere is to the last something faintly fatuous about his halfsceptical half sentimental selfimportance a lord chamberlain ofteacup politics an earnest and elderly flirt a german of the germans</s> now carlyle had humour he had it in his very style but it never gotinto his philosophy</s>  his philosophy largely remained a heavy teutonicidealism absurdly unaware of the complexity of things as when heperpetually repeated as with a kind of flatfooted stamping thatpeople ought to tell the truth apparently supposing to quotestevensons phrase that telling the truth is as easy as blind hookey</s> yet though his general honesty is unquestionable he was by no meansone of those who will give up a fancy under the shock of a fact</s>  if bysheer genius he frequently guessed right he was not the kind of man toadmit easily that he had guessed wrong</s>  his version of cromwells filthycruelties in ireland or his impatient slurring over of the mostsinister riddle in the morality of frederick the greatthese passagesare one must frankly say disingenuous</s>  but it is so to speak agenerous disingenuousness the heat and momentum of sincere admirationsnot the shuffling fear and flattery of the constitutional or patriotichistorian</s>  it bears most resemblance to the incurable prejudices of awoman</s> for the rest there hovered behind all this transcendental haze a certainpresence of old northern paganism he really had some sympathy with thevast vague gods of that moody but not unmanly natureworship which seemsto have filled the darkness of the north before the coming of the romaneagle or the christian cross</s>  this he combined allowing for certainsceptical omissions with the grisly old testament god he had heardabout in the black sabbaths of his childhood and so promulgatedagainst both rationalists and catholics a sort of heathen puritanismprotestantism purged of its evidences of christianity</s> his great and real work was the attack on utilitarianism which did realgood though there was much that was muddled and dangerous in thehistorical philosophy which he preached as an alternative</s>  it is hisreal glory that he was the first to see clearly and say plainly thegreat truth of our time that the wealth of the state is not theprosperity of the people</s>  macaulay and the mills and all the regular runof the early victorians took it for granted that if manchester wasgetting richer we had got hold of the key to comfort and progress</s> carlyle pointed out with stronger sagacity and humour than he showed onany other question that it was just as true to say that manchester wasgetting poorer as that it was getting richer or in other words thatmanchester was not getting richer at all but only some of the lesspleasing people in manchester</s>  in this matter he is to be noted inconnection with national developments much later for he thus became thefirst prophet of the socialists</s>  sartor resartus is an admirablefantasia the french revolution is with all its faults a reallyfine piece of history the lectures on heroes contain some masterlysketches of personalities</s>  but i think it is in past and present andthe essay on chartism that carlyle achieves the work he was chosen bygods and men to achieve which possibly might not have been achieved bya happier or more healthyminded man</s>  he never rose to more deadly ironythan in such macabre descriptions as that of the poor woman provingher sisterhood with the rich by giving them all typhoid fever or thatperfect piece of badinage about overproduction of shirts in whichhe imagines the aristocrats claiming to be quite clear of this offence</s> will you bandy accusations will you accuse us of overproduction</s>  wetake the heavens and the earth to witness that we have produced nothingat all</s> </s> </s> </s>  he that accuses us of producing let him show himself</s>  lethim say what and when</s>  and he never wrote so sternly and justly as whenhe compared the divine sorrow of dante with the undivine sorrow ofutilitarianism which had already come down to talking about thebreeding of the poor and to hinting at infanticide</s>  this is arepresentative quarrel for if the utilitarian spirit reached itshighest point in mill it certainly reached its lowest point in malthus</s> one last element in the influence of carlyle ought to be mentionedbecause it very strongly dominated his disciplesespecially kingsleyand to some extent tennyson and ruskin</s>  because he frowned at thecockney cheerfulness of the cheaper economists they and othersrepresented him as a pessimist and reduced all his azure infinities toa fit of the blues</s>  but carlyles philosophy more carefully consideredwill be found to be dangerously optimist rather than pessimist</s>  as athinker carlyle is not sad but recklessly and rather unscrupulouslysatisfied</s>  for he seems to have held the theory that good could not bedefinitely defeated in this world and that everything in the long runfinds its right level</s>  it began with what we may call the bible ofhistory idea that all affairs and politics were a clouded but unbrokenrevelation of the divine</s>  thus any enormous and unaltered humansettlementas the norman conquest or the secession of americawe mustsuppose to be the will of god</s>  it lent itself to picturesque treatmentand carlyle and the carlyleans were above all things picturesque</s>  itgave them at first a rhetorical advantage over the catholic and otherolder schools</s>  they could boast that their creator was still creatingthat he was in man and nature and was not hedged round in a paradise orimprisoned in a pyx</s>  they could say their god had not grown too old forwar that he was present at gettysburg and gravelotte as much as atgibeon and gilboa</s>  i do not mean that they literally said theseparticular things they are what i should have said had i been bribed todefend their position</s>  but they said things to the same effect thatwhat manages finally to happen happens for a higher purpose</s>  carlylesaid the french revolution was a thing settled in the eternal councilsto be and therefore and not because it was right attacking it wasfighting against god</s>  and kingsley even carried the principle so faras to tell a lady she should remain in the church of england mainlybecause god had put her there</s>  but in spite of its superficialspirituality and encouragement it is not hard to see how such adoctrine could be abused</s>  it practically comes to saying that god is onthe side of the big battalionsor at least of the victorious ones</s> thus a creed which set out to create conquerors would only corruptsoldiers corrupt them with a craven and unsoldierly worship of successand that which began as the philosophy of courage ends as the philosophyof cowardice</s>  if indeed carlyle were right in saying that right isonly rightly articulated might men would never articulate or move inany way</s>  for no act can have might before it is done if there is noright it cannot rationally be done at all</s>  this element like theantiutilitarian element is to be kept in mind in connection with afterdevelopments for in this carlyle is the first cry of imperialism asin the other case of socialism and the two babes unborn who stir atthe trumpet are mr</s>  bernard shaw and mr</s>  rudyard kipling</s>  kipling alsocarries on from carlyle the concentration on the purely hebraic parts ofthe bible</s>  the fallacy of this whole philosophy is that if god is indeedpresent at a modern battle he may be present not as on gilboa butgolgotha</s> carlyles direct historical worship of strength and the rest of it wasfortunately not very fruitful and perhaps lingered only in froude thehistorian</s>  even he is more an interruption than a continuity</s>  froudedevelops rather the harsher and more impatient moral counsels of hismaster than like ruskin the more romantic and sympathetic</s>  he carries onthe tradition of hero worship but carries far beyond carlyle thepractice of worshipping people who cannot rationally be called heroes</s> in this matter that eccentric eye of the seer certainly helped carlylein cromwell and frederick the great there was at least somethingselfbegotten original or mystical if they were not heroes they wereat least demigods or perhaps demons</s>  but froude set himself to thepraise of the tudors a much lower class of people illconditionedprosperous people who merely waxed fat and kicked</s>  such strength ashenry viii had was the strength of a badly trained horse that bolts notof any clear or courageous rider who controls him</s>  there is a sort ofstrong man mentioned in scripture who because he masters himself ismore than he that takes a city</s>  there is another kind of strong manknown to the medical profession who cannot master himself and whom itmay take half a city to take alive</s>  but for all that he is a lowlunatic and not a hero and of that sort were too many of the heroeswhom froude attempted to praise</s>  a kind of instinct kept carlyle fromoverpraising henry viii or that highly cultivated and complicatedliar queen elizabeth</s>  here the only importance of this is that one ofcarlyles followers carried further that strength which was the realweakness of carlyle</s>  i have heard that froudes life of carlyle wasunsympathetic but if it was so it was a sort of parricide</s>  for therest like macaulay he was a picturesque and partisan historian butlike macaulay and unlike the craven scientific historians of today hewas not ashamed of being partisan or of being picturesque</s>  such studiesas he wrote on the elizabethan seamen and adventurers represent verytriumphantly the sort of romance of england that all this school wasattempting to establish and link him up with kingsley and the rest</s> ruskin may be very roughly regarded as the young lieutenant of carlylein his war on utilitarian radicalism but as an individual he presentsmany and curious divergences</s>  in the matter of style he enrichedenglish without disordering it</s>  and in the matter of religion whichwas the key of this age as of every other he did not like carlyle setup the romance of the great puritans as a rival to the romance of thecatholic church</s>  rather he set up and worshipped all the arts andtrophies of the catholic church as a rival to the church itself</s>  noneneed dispute that he held a perfectly tenable position if he chose toassociate early florentine art with a christianity still comparativelypure and such sensualities as the renaissance bred with the corruptionof a papacy</s>  but this does not alter as a merely artistic fact thestrange air of illease and irritation with which ruskin seems to teardown the gargoyles of amiens or the marbles of venice as things ofwhich europe is not worthy and take them away with him to a reallycareful museum situated dangerously near clapham</s>  many of the great menof that generation indeed had a sort of divided mind an ethicalheadache which was literally a splitting headache for there was aschism in the sympathies</s>  when these men looked at some historicobject like the catholic church or the french revolution they did notknow whether they loved or hated it most</s>  carlyles two eyes were out offocus as one may say when he looked at democracy he had one eye onvalmy and the other on sedan</s>  in the same way ruskin had a strong righthand that wrote of the great medival minsters in tall harmonies andtraceries as splendid as their own and also so to speak a weak andfeverish left hand that was always fidgeting and trying to take the penawayand write an evangelical tract about the immorality of foreigners</s> many of their contemporaries were the same</s>  the sea of tennysons mindwas troubled under its serene surface</s>  the incessant excitement ofkingsley though romantic and attractive in many ways was a great dealmore like nervous christianity than muscular christianity</s>  it would bequite unfair to say of ruskin that there was any major inconsistencybetween his medival tastes and his very unmedival temper and minorinconsistencies do not matter in anybody</s>  but it is not quite unfair tosay of him that he seemed to want all parts of the cathedral except thealtar</s> as an artist in prose he is one of the most miraculous products of theextremely poetical genius of england</s>  the length of a ruskin sentence islike that length in the long arrow that was boasted of by the drawers ofthe long bow</s>  he draws not a clothyard shaft but a long lance to hisear he shoots a spear</s>  but the whole goes light as a bird and straightas a bullet</s>  there is no victorian writer before him to whom he evensuggests a comparison technically considered except perhaps dequincey who also employed the long rich rolling sentence that like arocket bursts into stars at the end</s>  but de quinceys sentences as ihave said have always a dreamy and insecure sense about them like theturret on toppling turret of some mad sultans pagoda</s>  ruskins sentencebranches into brackets and relative clauses as a straight strong treebranches into boughs and bifurcations rather shaking off its burdenthan merely adding to it</s>  it is interesting to remember that ruskinwrote some of the best of these sentences in the attempt to show that hedid understand the growth of trees and that nobody else didexceptturner of course</s>  it is also to those acquainted with his perverse andwild rhetorical prejudices even more amusing to remember that if aruskin sentence occupying one or two pages of small print does notremind us of the growth of a tree the only other thing it does remindof is the triumphant passage of a railway train</s> ruskin left behind him in his turn two quite separate streams ofinspiration</s>  the first and more practical was concerned like carlyleschartism with a challenge to the social conclusions of the orthodoxeconomists</s>  he was not so great a man as carlyle but he was a much moreclearheaded man and the point and stab of his challenge still reallystands and sticks like a dagger in a dead man</s>  he answered the theorythat we must always get the cheapest labour we can by pointing out thatwe never do get the cheapest labour we can in any matter about which wereally care twopence</s>  we do not get the cheapest doctor</s>  we either get adoctor who charges nothing or a doctor who charges a recognised andrespectable fee</s>  we do not trust the cheapest bishop</s>  we do not allowadmirals to compete</s>  we do not tell generals to undercut each other onthe eve of a war</s>  we either employ none of them or we employ all of themat an official rate of pay</s>  all this was set out in the strongest andleast sentimental of his books unto this last but many suggestionsof it are scattered through sesame and lilies the political economyof art and even modern painters</s>  on this side of his soul ruskinbecame the second founder of socialism</s>  the argument was not by anymeans a complete or unconquerable weapon but i think it knocked outwhat little remained of the brains of the early victorian rationalists</s> it is entirely nonsensical to speak of ruskin as a lounging sthete whostrolled into economics and talked sentimentalism</s>  in plain factruskin was seldom so sensible and logical right or wrong as when hewas talking about economics</s>  he constantly talked the most gloriousnonsense about landscape and natural history which it was his businessto understand</s>  within his own limits he talked the most cold commonsense about political economy which was no business of his at all</s> on the other side of his literary soul his mere unwrapping of thewealth and wonder of european art he set going another influenceearlier and vaguer than his influence on socialism</s>  he represented whatwas at first the preraphaelite school in painting but afterwards amuch larger and looser preraphaelite school in poetry and prose</s>  theword looser will not be found unfair if we remember how swinburne andall the wildest friends of the rossettis carried this movement forward</s> they used the medival imagery to blaspheme the medival religion</s> ruskins dark and doubtful decision to accept catholic art but notcatholic ethics had borne rapid or even flagrant fruit by the time thatswinburne writing about a harlot composed a learned and sympatheticand indecent parody on the litany of the blessed virgin</s> with the poets i deal in another part of this book but the influence ofruskins great prose touching art criticism can best be expressed in thename of the next great prose writer on such subjects</s>
 patereventually joined the church of rome which would not have pleasedruskin at all but it is surely fair to say of the mass of his workthat its moral tone is neither puritan nor catholic but strictly andsplendidly pagan</s>  in pater we have ruskin without the prejudices thatis without the funny parts</s>  i may be wrong but i cannot recall at thismoment a single passage in which paters style takes a holiday or inwhich his wisdom plays the fool</s>  newman and ruskin were as careful andgraceful stylists as he</s>  newman and ruskin were as serious elaborateand even academic thinkers as he</s>  but ruskin let himself go aboutrailways</s>  newman let himself go about kingsley</s>  pater cannot let himselfgo for the excellent reason that he wants to stay to stay at the pointwhere all the keenest emotions meet as he explains in the splendidperoration of the renaissance</s>  the only objection to being where allthe keenest emotions meet is that you feel none of them</s> in this sense pater may well stand for a substantial summary of thesthetes apart from the purely poetical merits of men like rossetti andswinburne</s>  like swinburne and others he first attempted to use medivaltradition without trusting it</s>  these people wanted to see paganismthrough christianity because it involved the incidental amusement ofseeing through christianity itself</s>  they not only tried to be in allages at once which is a very reasonable ambition though not oftenrealised but they wanted to be on all sides at once which isnonsense</s>  swinburne tries to question the philosophy of christianity inthe metres of a christmas carol and dante rossetti tries to write as ifhe were christina rossetti</s>  certainly the almost successful summit ofall this attempt is paters superb passage on the mona lisa in which heseeks to make her at once a mystery of good and a mystery of evil</s>  thephilosophy is false even evidently false for it bears no fruit today</s> there never was a woman not eve herself in the instant of temptationwho could smile the same smile as the mother of helen and the mother ofmary</s>  but it is the highwater mark of that vast attempt at animpartiality reached through art and no other mere artist ever rose sohigh again</s> apart from this ruskinian offshoot through preraphaelitism into whatwas called stheticism the remains of the inspiration of carlyle fill avery large part in the victorian life but not strictly so large a partin the victorian literature</s>  charles kingsley was a great publicist apopular preacher a popular novelist and in two cases at least a verygood novelist</s>  his water babies is really a breezy and roaring freaklike a holiday at the seasidea holiday where one talks natural historywithout taking it seriously</s>  some of the songs in this and other of hisworks are very real songs notably when all the world is young ladwhich comes very near to being the only true defence of marriage in thecontroversies of the nineteenth century</s>  but when all this is allowedno one will seriously rank kingsley in the really literary sense onthe level of carlyle or ruskin tennyson or browning dickens orthackeray and if such a place cannot be given to him it can be giveneven less to his lusty and pleasant friend tom hughes whosepersonality floats towards the frankness of the boys own paper or tohis deep suggestive metaphysical friend maurice who floats rathertowards the hibbert journal</s>  the moral and social influence of thesethings is not to be forgotten but they leave the domain of letters</s>  thevoice of carlyle is not heard again in letters till the coming ofkipling and henley</s> one other name of great importance should appear here because it cannotappear very appropriately anywhere else the man

culture almost as if it were a man or at least achurch for a church has a sort of personality some may suspect thatculture was a man whose name was matthew arnold</s>  but arnold was notonly right but highly valuable</s>  if we have said that carlyle was a manthat saw things we may add that arnold was chiefly valuable as a manwho knew things</s>  well as he was endowed intellectually his power camemore from information than intellect</s>  he simply happened to know certainthings that carlyle didnt know that kingsley didnt know that huxleyand herbert spencer didnt know that england didnt know</s>  he knew thatengland was a part of europe and not so important a part as it had beenthe morning after waterloo</s>  he knew that england was then as it is nowan oligarchical state and that many great nations are not</s>  he knewthat a real democracy need not live and does not live in that perpetualpanic about using the powers of the state which possessed men likespencer and cobden</s>  he knew a rational minimum of culture and commoncourtesy could exist and did exist throughout large democracies</s>  he knewthe catholic church had been in history the church of the multitudehe knew it was not a sect</s>  he knew that great landlords are no more apart of the economic law than niggerdrivers he knew that small ownerscould and did prosper</s>  he was not so much the philosopher as the man ofthe world he reminded us that europe was a society while ruskin wastreating it as a picture gallery</s>  he was a sort of heavensent courier</s> his frontal attack on the vulgar and sullen optimism of victorianutility may be summoned up in the admirable sentence in which he askedthe english what was the use of a train taking them quickly fromislington to camberwell if it only took them from a dismal andilliberal life in islington to a dismal and illiberal life incamberwell</s> his attitude to that great religious enigma round which all these greatmen were grouped as in a ring was individual and decidedly curious</s>  heseems to have believed that a historic church that is someestablished organisation with ceremonies and sacred books etc</s>  couldbe perpetually preserved as a sort of vessel to contain the spiritualideas of the age whatever those ideas might happen to be</s>  he clearlyseems to have contemplated a melting away of the doctrines of the churchand even of the meaning of the words but he thought a certain need inman would always be best satisfied by public worship and especially bythe great religious literatures of the past</s>  he would embalm the bodythat it might often be revisited by the soulor souls</s>  something of thesort has been suggested by dr</s>  coit and others of the ethical societiesin our own time</s>  but while arnold would loosen the theological bonds ofthe church he would not loosen the official bonds of the state</s>  youmust not disestablish the church you must not even leave the churchyou must stop inside it and think what you choose</s>  enemies might saythat he was simply trying to establish and endow agnosticism</s>  it isfairer and truer to say that unconsciously he was trying to restorepaganism for this state ritualism without theology and without muchbelief actually was the practice of the ancient world</s>  arnold may havethought that he was building an altar to the unknown god but he wasreally building it to divus csar</s> as a critic he was chiefly concerned to preserve criticism itself toset a measure to praise and blame and support the classics against thefashions</s>  it is here that it is specially true of him if of no writerelse that the style was the man</s>  the most vital thing he invented was anew style founded on the patient unravelling of the tangled victorianideas as if they were matted

down</s>  arnolds greaterror was that he sometimes thus wearied us of his own phrases as wellas of his enemies</s> these names are roughly representative of the long series of protestsagainst the cold

desecrated religion</s>  but already the utilitarian citadel hadbeen more heavily bombarded on the other side by one lonely andunlettered man of genius</s> the rise of dickens is like the rising of a vast mob</s>  this is not onlybecause his tales are indeed as crowded and populous as towns for trulyit was not so much that dickens appeared as that a hundred dickenscharacters appeared</s>  it is also because he was the sort of man who hasthe impersonal impetus of a mob what poe meant when he truly said thatpopular rumour if really spontaneous was like the intuition of theindividual man of genius</s>  those who speak scornfully of the ignorance ofthe mob do not err as to the fact itself their error is in not seeingthat just as a crowd is comparatively ignorant so a crowd iscomparatively innocent</s>  it will have the old and human faults but it isnot likely to specialise in the special faults of that particularsociety because the effort of the strong and successful in all ages isto keep the poor out of society</s>  if the higher castes have developedsome special moral beauty or grace as they occasionally do forinstance medival chivalry it is likely enough of course that themass of men will miss it</s>  but if they have developed some perversion oroveremphasis as they much more often do for instance the renaissancepoisoning then it will be the tendency of the mass of men to miss thattoo</s>  the point might be put in many ways you may say if you will thatthe poor are always at the tail of the procession and that whether theyare morally worse or better depends on whether

ofnature he had not a theory but a thirst</s>  if any one chooses to offerthe cheap sarcasm that his thirst was largely a thirst for milkpunch iam content to reply with complete gravity and entire contempt that in asense this is perfectly true</s>  his thirst was for things as humble ashuman as laughable as that daily bread for which we cry to god</s>  he hadno particular plan of reform or when

to all mankind he hated it as kate nickleby hated sirmulberry hawkeby instinct</s>  carlyle could have told him that all theworld was full of that anger against the impudent fatness of the few</s> but when dickens wrote about kate nickleby he knew about as much of theworldas kate nickleby</s>  he did write the tale of two cities longafterwards but that was when he had been instructed by carlyle</s>  hisfirst revolutionism was as private and internal as feeling seasick</s> thus once more he wrote against mr</s>  gradgrind long before he createdhim</s>  in the chimes conceived in quite his casual and charitableseason with the christmas carol and the cricket on the hearth hehit hard at the economists</s>  ruskin in the same fashion would have toldhim that the worst thing about the economists was that they were noteconomists that they missed many essential things even in economics</s> but dickens did not know whether they were economists or not he onlyknew that they wanted hitting</s>  thus to take a last case out of manydickens travelled in a french railway train and noticed that thiseccentric nation provided him with wine that he could drink andsandwiches he could eat and manners he could tolerate</s>  and rememberingthe ghastly sawdusteating waitingrooms of the north english railwayshe wrote that rich chapter in mugby junction</s>  matthew arnold couldhave told him that this was but a part of the general thinning down ofeuropean civilisation in these islands at the edge of it that for twoor three thousand years the latin society has learnt how to drink wineand how not to drink too much of it</s>  dickens did not in the leastunderstand the latin society but he did understand the wine</s>  if toprolong an idle but not entirely false metaphor we have called carlylea man who saw and arnold a man who knew we might truly call dickens aman who tasted that is a man who really felt</s>  in spite of all thesilly talk about his vulgarity he really had in the strict andserious sense good taste</s>  all real good taste is gustothe power ofappreciating the presenceor the absenceof a particular and positivepleasure</s>  he had no learning he was not misled by the label on thebottlefor that is what learning largely meant in his time</s>  he openedhis mouth and shut his eyes and saw what the age of reason would givehim</s>  and having tasted it he spat it out</s> i am constrained to consider dickens here among the fighters though iought on the pure principles of art to be considering him in thechapter which i have allotted to the storytellers</s>  but we should getthe whole victorian perspective wrong in my opinion at least if we didnot see that dickens was primarily the most successful of all theonslaughts on the solid scientific school because he did not attackfrom the standpoint of extraordinary faith like newman or thestandpoint of extraordinary inspiration like carlyle or the standpointof extraordinary detachment or serenity like arnold but from thestandpoint of quite ordinary and quite hearty dislike</s>  to give but oneinstance more matthew arnold trying to carry into england constructiveeducational schemes which he could see spread like a clear railway mapall over the continent was much badgered about what he really thoughtwas wrong with english middleclass education</s>  despairing ofexplaining to the english middle class the idea of high and centralpublic instruction as distinct from coarse and holeandcorner privateinstruction he invoked the aid of dickens</s>  he said the englishmiddleclass school was the sort of school where mr</s>  creakle sat withhis buttered toast and his cane</s>  now dickens had probably never seen anyother kind of schoolcertainly he had never understood the systematicstate schools in which arnold had learnt his lesson</s>  but he saw the caneand the buttered toast and he knew that it was all wrong</s>  in thissense dickens the great romanticist is truly the great realist also</s> for he had no abstractions he had nothing except realities out of whichto make a romance</s> with dickens then rearises that reality with which i began and whichcurtly but i think not falsely i have called cobbett</s>  in dealing withfiction as such i shall have occasion to say wherein dickens is weakerand stronger than that england of the eighteenth century here it issufficient to say that he represents the return of cobbett in this vitalsense that he is proud of being the ordinary man</s>  no one can understandthe thousand caricatures by dickens who does not understand that he iscomparing them all with his own common sense</s>  dickens in the bulkliked the things that cobbett had liked what is perhaps more to thepoint he hated the things that cobbett had hated the tudors thelawyers the leisurely oppression of the poor</s>  cobbetts fine fightingjournalism had been what is nowadays called personal that is itsupposed human beings to be human</s>  but cobbett was also personal in theless satisfactory sense he could only multiply monsters who wereexaggerations of his enemies or exaggerations of himself</s>  dickens waspersonal in a more godlike sense he could multiply persons</s>  he couldcreate all the farce and tragedy of his age over again with creaturesunborn to sin and creatures unborn to suffer</s>  that which had not beenachieved by the fierce facts of cobbett the burning dreams of carlylethe whitehot proofs of newman was really or very nearly achieved by acrowd of impossible people</s>  in the centre stood that citadel of atheistindustrialism and if indeed it has ever been taken it was taken by therush of that unreal army</s> chapter iithe great victorian noveliststhe victorian novel was a thing entirely victorian quite unique andsuited to a sort of cosiness in that country and that age</s>  but the novelitself though not merely victorian is mainly modern</s>  no clearheadedperson wastes his time over definitions except where he thinks his owndefinition would probably be in dispute</s>  i merely say therefore thatwhen i say novel i mean a fictitious narrative almost invariablybut not necessarily in prose of which the essential is that the storyis not told for the sake of its naked pointedness as an anecdote or forthe sake of the irrelevant landscapes and visions that can be caught upin it but for the sake of some study of the difference between humanbeings</s>  there are several things that make this mode of art unique</s>  oneof the most conspicuous is that it is the art in which the conquests ofwoman are quite beyond controversy</s>  the proposition that victorian womenhave done well in politics and philosophy is not necessarily an untrueproposition but it is a partisan proposition</s>  i never heard that manywomen let alone men shared the views of mary wollstonecraft i neverheard that millions of believers flocked to the religion tentativelyfounded by miss frances power cobbe</s>  they did undoubtedly flock tomrs</s>  eddy but it will not be unfair to that lady to call her followinga sect and not altogether unreasonable to say that such insaneexceptions prove the rule</s>  nor can i at this moment think of a singlemodern woman writing on politics or abstract things whose work is ofundisputed importance except perhaps mrs</s>  sidney webb who settlesthings by the simple process of ordering about the citizens of a stateas she might the servants in a kitchen</s>  there has been at any rate nowriter on moral or political theory that can be mentioned withoutseeming comic in the same breath with the great female novelists</s>  butwhen we come to the novelists the women have on the whole equalityand certainly in some points superiority</s>  jane austen is as strong inher own way as scott is in his</s>  but she is for all practical purposesnever weak in her own wayand scott very often is</s>  charlotte brontdedicated jane eyre to the author of vanity fair</s>  i should hesitateto say that charlotte bronts is a better book than thackerays but ithink it might well be maintained that it is a better story</s>  all sortsof inquiring asses equally ignorant of the old nature of woman and thenew nature of the novel whispered wisely that george eliots novelswere really written by george lewes</s>  i will cheerfully answer for thefact that if they had been written by george lewes no one would everhave read them</s>  those who have read his book on robespierre will haveno doubt about my meaning</s>
 i am no idolater of george eliot but a manwho could concoct such a crushing opiate about the most excitingoccasion in history certainly did not write the mill on the floss</s> this is the first fact about the novel that it is the introduction of anew and rather curious kind of art and it has been found to bepeculiarly feminine from the first good novel by fanny burney to thelast good novel by miss may sinclair</s>  the truth is i think that themodern novel is a new thing not new in its essence for that is aphilosophy for fools but new in the sense that it lets loose many ofthe things that are old</s>
 it is a hearty and exhaustive overhauling ofthat part of human existence which has always been the womans provinceor rather kingdom the play of personalities in private the realdifference between tommy and joe</s>  it is right that womanhood shouldspecialise in individuals and be praised for doing so just as in themiddle ages she specialised in dignity and was praised for doing so</s> people put the matter wrong when they say that the novel is a study ofhuman nature</s>  human nature is a thing that even men can understand</s> human nature is born of the pain of a woman human nature plays atpeepbo when it is two and at cricket when it is twelve human natureearns its living and desires the other sex and dies</s>  what the noveldeals with is what women have to deal with the differentiations thetwists and turns of this eternal river</s>  the key of this new form of artwhich we call fiction is sympathy</s>  and sympathy does not mean so muchfeeling with all who feel but rather suffering with all who suffer</s>  andit was inevitable under such an inspiration that more attention shouldbe given to the awkward corners of life than to its even flow</s>  the verypromising domestic channel dug by the victorian women in books likecranford by mrs</s>  gaskell would have got to the sea if they had beenleft alone to dig it</s>  they might have made domesticity a fairyland</s> unfortunately another idea the idea of imitating mens cuffs andcollars and documents cut across this purely female discovery anddestroyed it</s> it may seem mere praise of the novel to say it is the art of sympathyand the study of human variations</s>  but indeed though this is a goodthing it is not universally good</s>  we have gained in sympathy but wehave lost in brotherhood</s>  old quarrels had more equality than modernexonerations</s>  two peasants in the middle ages quarrelled about their twofields</s>  but they went to the same church served in the same semifeudalmilitia and had the same morality which ever might happen to bebreaking it at the moment</s>  the very cause of their quarrel was the causeof their fraternity they both liked land</s>  but suppose one of them ateetotaler who desired the abolition of hops on both farms suppose theother a vegetarian who desired the abolition of chickens on both farmsand it is at once apparent that a quarrel of quite a different kindwould begin and that in that quarrel it would not be a question offarmer against farmer but of individual against individual</s>  thisfundamental sense of human fraternity can only exist in the presence ofpositive religion</s>  man is merely man only when he is seen against thesky</s>  if he is seen against any landscape he is only a man of that land</s> if he is seen against any house he is only a householder</s>  only wheredeath and eternity are intensely present can human beings fully feeltheir fellowship</s>
this can be seen in a sort of picture in the prologue of the canterburytales which is already pregnant with the promise of the english novel</s> the characters there are at once graphically and delicatelydifferentiated the doctor with his rich cloak his careful meals hiscoldness to religion the franklin whose white beard was so fresh thatit recalled the daisies and in whose house it snowed meat and drinkthe summoner from whose fearful face like a red cherubs the childrenfled and who wore a garland like a hoop the miller with his short redhair and bagpipes and brutal head with which he

verbal strokes</s>  but the greatdifference is deeper and more striking</s>  it is simply that pendenniswould never have gone riding with a cook at all</s>  chaucers knight rodewith a cook quite

in humanity</s>  it is an increase in the interestin the things in which men differ much fuller and finer work had beendone before about the things in which they agree</s>  and this intenseinterest in variety had its bad side as well as its good it has ratherincreased social distinctions in a serious and spiritual sense</s>  most ofthe oblivion of democracy is due to the oblivion of death</s>  but in itsown manner and measure it was a real advance and experiment of theeuropean mind like the public art of the renaissance or the fairylandof physical science explored in the nineteenth century</s>  it was a moreunquestionable benefit than these and in that development women playeda peculiar part english women especially and victorian women most ofall</s> it is perhaps partly though certainly not entirely this influence ofthe great women writers that explains another very arresting andimportant fact about the emergence of genuinely victorian fiction</s>  ithad been by this time decided by the powers that had influence and bypublic opinion also at least in the middleclass sense that certainverbal limits must be set to such literature</s>  the novel must be whatsome would call pure and others would call prudish but what is notproperly considered either one or the other it is rather a more orless business proposal right or wrong that every writer shall draw theline at literal physical description of things socially concealed</s>  itwas originally merely verbal it had not primarily any dream ofpurifying the topic or the moral tone</s>  dickens and thackeray claimedvery properly the right to deal with shameful passions and suggest theirshameful culminations scott sometimes dealt with ideas positivelyhorribleas in that grand glenallan tragedy which is as appalling asthe dipus or the cenci</s>  none of these great men would havetolerated for a moment being talked to as the muddleheaded amateurcensors talk to artists today about wholesome topics and suggestionsthat cannot elevate</s>  they had to describe the great battle of good andevil and they described both but they accepted a working victoriancompromise about what should happen behind the scenes and what on thestage</s>  dickens did not claim the license of diction fielding might haveclaimed in repeating the senile ecstasies of gride let us say over hispurchased bride but dickens does not leave the reader in the faintestdoubt about what sort of feelings they were nor is there any reason whyhe should</s>  thackeray would not have described the toilet details of thesecret balls of lord steyne he left that to lady cardigan</s>  but no onewho had read thackerays version would be surprised at lady cardigans</s> but though the great victorian novelists would not have permitted theimpudence of the suggestion that every part of their problem must bewholesome and innocent in itself it is still tenable i do not say itis certain that by yielding to the philistines on this verbalcompromise they have in the long run worked for impurity rather thanpurity</s>  in one point i do certainly think that victorian bowdlerism didpure harm</s>  this is the simple point that nine times out of ten thecoarse word is the word that condemns an evil and the refined word theword that excuses it</s>  a common evasion for instance substitutes forthe word that brands selfsale as the essential sin a word which weaklysuggests that it is no more wicked than walking down the street</s>  thegreat peril of such soft mystifications is that extreme evils theythat are abnormal even by the standard of evil have a very long start</s> where ordinary wrong is made unintelligible extraordinary wrong cancount on remaining more unintelligible still especially among those wholive in such an atmosphere of long words</s>  it is a cruel comment on thepurity of the victorian age that the age ended save for the burstingof a single scandal in a thing being everywhere called art thegreek spirit the platonic ideal and so onwhich any navvy mendingthe road outside would have stamped with a word as vile and as vulgar asit deserved</s> this reticence right or wrong may have been connected with theparticipation of women with men in the matter of fiction</s>  it is animportant point the sexes can only be coarse separately</s>  it wascertainly also due as i have already suggested to the treaty betweenthe rich bourgeoisie and the old aristocracy which both had to makefor the common and congenial purpose of keeping the english peopledown</s>  but it was due much more than this to a general moral atmospherein the victorian age</s>  it is impossible to express that spirit except bythe electric bell of a name</s>  it was latitudinarian and yet it waslimited</s>  it could be content with nothing less than the whole cosmosyet the cosmos with which it was content was small</s>  it is false to sayit was without humour yet there was something by instinct unsmiling init</s>  it was always

definitions seem to escape this way and that inthe attempt to locate it as an idea</s>  but every one will understand me ifi call it george eliot</s> i begin with this great woman of letters for both the two reasonsalready mentioned</s>  she represents the rationalism of the old victorianage at its highest</s>  she and mill are like two great mountains at the endof that long hard chain which is the watershed of the early victoriantime</s>  they alone rise high enough to be confused among the cloudsorperhaps confused among the stars</s>  they certainly were seeking truth asnewman and carlyle were the slow slope of the later victorian vulgaritydoes not lower their precipice and pinnacle</s>  but i begin with this namealso because it emphasises the idea of modern fiction as a fresh andlargely a female thing</s>  the novel of the nineteenth century was femaleas fully as the novel of the eighteenth century was male</s>  it is quitecertain that no woman could have written roderick random</s>  it is notquite so certain that no woman could have written esmond</s>  the strengthand subtlety of woman had certainly sunk deep into english letters whengeorge eliot began to write</s> her originals and even her contemporaries had shown the feminine powerin fiction as well or better than she</s>  charlotte bront understoodalong her own instincts was as great jane austen was greater</s>  thelatter comes into our present consideration only as that mostexasperating thing an ideal unachieved</s>  it is like leaving anunconquered fortress in the rear</s>  no woman later has captured thecomplete common sense of jane austen</s>  she could keep her head while allthe after women went about looking for their brains</s>  she could describea man coolly which neither george eliot nor charlotte bront could do</s> she knew what she knew like a sound dogmatist she did not know whatshe did not knowlike a sound agnostic</s>  but she belongs to a vanishedworld before the great progressive age of which i write</s> one of the characteristics of the central victorian spirit was atendency to substitute a certain more or less satisfied seriousness forthe extremes of tragedy and comedy</s>  this is marked by a certain changein george eliot as it is marked by a certain limitation or moderationin dickens</s>  dickens was the people as it was in the eighteenth centuryand still largely is in spite of all the talk for and against boardschool education comic tragic realistic freespoken far looser inwords than in deeds</s>  it marks the silent strength and pressure of thespirit of the victorian middle class that even to dickens it neveroccurred to revive the verbal coarseness of smollett or swift</s>  the otherproof of the same pressure is the change in george eliot</s>  she was not agenius in the elemental sense of dickens she could never have beeneither so strong or so soft</s>  but she did originally represent some ofthe same popular realities and her first books at least as comparedwith her latest were full of sound fun and bitter pathos</s>  mr</s>  maxbeerbohm has remarked in his glorious essay called ichabod i thinkthat silas marner would not have forgotten his miserliness if georgeeliot had written of him in her maturity</s>  i have a great regard for mr</s> beerbohms literary judgments and it may be so</s>  but if literaturemeans anything more than a cold calculation of the chances if there isin it as i believe any deeper idea of detaching the spirit of lifefrom the dull obstacles of life of permitting human nature really toreveal itself as human if to put it shortly literature has anythingon earth to do with being interestingthen i think we would ratherhave a few more marners than that rich maturity that gave us theanalysed dustheaps of daniel deronda</s> in her best novels there is real humour of a cool sparkling sort thereis a strong sense of substantial character that has not yet degeneratedinto psychology there is a great deal of wisdom chiefly about womenindeed there is almost every element of literature except a certainindescribable thing called glamour which was the whole stockintradeof the bronts which we feel in dickens when quilp clambers amid rottenwood by the desolate river and even in thackeray when esmond with hismelancholy eyes wanders like some swarthy crow about the dismal avenuesof castlewood</s>  of this quality which some have called but hastily theessential of literature george eliot had not little but nothing</s>  herair is bright and intellectually even exciting but it is like the airof a cloudless day on the parade at brighton</s>  she sees people clearlybut not through an atmosphere</s>  and she can conjure up storms in theconscious but not in the subconscious mind</s> it is true though the idea should not be exaggerated that thisdeficiency was largely due to her being cut off from all thoseconceptions that had made the fiction of a muse the deep idea thatthere are really demons and angels behind men</s>  certainly the increasingatheism of her school spoilt her own particular imaginative talent shewas far less free when she thought like ladislaw than when she thoughtlike casaubon</s>  it also betrayed her on a matter specially requiringcommon sense i mean sex</s>  there is nothing that is so profoundly falseas rationalist flirtation</s>  each sex is trying to be both sexes at onceand the result is a confusion more untruthful than any conventions</s>  thiscan easily be seen by comparing her with a greater woman who died beforethe beginning of our present problem</s>  jane austen was born before thosebonds which we are told protected woman from truth were burst by thebronts or elaborately untied by george eliot</s>  yet the fact remains thatjane austen knew much more about men than either of them</s>  jane austenmay have been protected from truth but it was precious little of truththat was protected from her</s>  when darcy in finally confessing hisfaults says i have been a selfish being all my life in practicethough not in theory he gets nearer to a complete confession of theintelligent male than ever was even hinted by the byronic lapses of thebronts heroes or the elaborate exculpations of george eliots</s>  janeausten of course covered an infinitely smaller field than any of herlater rivals but i have always believed in the victory of smallnationalities</s> the bronts suggest themselves here because their superficialqualities the qualities that can be seized upon in satire were in thisan exaggeration of what was in george eliot hardly more than anomission</s>  there was perhaps a time when mr</s>  rawjester was more widelyknown than mr</s>  rochester</s>  and certainly mr</s>  rochester to adopt thediction of that other eminent country gentleman mr</s>  darcy was simplyindividualistic not only in practice but in theory</s>  now any one may beso in practice but a man who is simply individualistic in theory mustmerely be an ass</s>  undoubtedly the bronts exposed themselves to somemisunderstanding by thus perpetually making the masculine creature muchmore masculine than he wants to be</s>  thackeray a man of strong thoughsleepy virility asked in his exquisite plaintive way why do our ladynovelists make the men bully the women</s>  it is i think unquestionablytrue that the bronts treated the male as an almost anarchic thingcoming in from outside nature much as people on this planet regard acomet</s>  even the really delicate and sustained comedy of paul emanuel isnot quite free from this air of studying something alien</s>  the reply maybe made that the women in mens novels are equally fallacious</s>  the replyis probably just</s> what the bronts really brought into fiction was exactly what carlylebrought into history the blast of the mysticism of the north</s>  they wereof irish blood settled on the windy heights of yorkshire in thatcountry where catholicism lingered latest but in a superstitious formwhere modern industrialism came earliest and was more superstitiousstill</s>  the strong winds and sterile places the old tyranny of baronsand the new and blacker tyranny of manufacturers has made and left thatcountry a land of barbarians</s>
 in this way charlotte brontrepresents the victorian settlement in a special way</s>  the earlyvictorian industrialism is to george eliot and to charlotte brontrather as the late victorian imperialism would have been to mrs</s>  humphryward in the centre of the empire and to miss olive schreiner at the edgeof it</s>  the real strength there is in characters like robert moore whenhe is dealing with anything except women is the romance of industry inits first advance a romance that has not remained</s>  on such fightingfrontiers people always exaggerate the strong qualities the masculinesex does possess and always add a great many strong qualities that itdoes not possess</s>  that is briefly all the reason in the bronts onthis special subject the rest is stark unreason</s>  it can be most clearlyseen in that sister of charlotte bronts who has achieved the realfeat of remaining as a great woman rather than a great writer</s>  there isreally in a narrow but intense way a tradition of emily bront asthere is a tradition of st</s>  peter or dr</s>  johnson</s>  people talk as if theyhad known her apart from her works</s>  she must have been something morethan an original person perhaps an origin</s>  but so far as her writtenworks go she enters english letters only as an original personandrather a narrow one</s>  her imagination was sometimes superhumanalwaysinhuman</s>  wuthering heights might have been written by an eagle</s>  she isthe strongest instance of these strong imaginations that made the othersex a monster for heathcliffe fails as a man as catastrophically as hesucceeds as a demon</s>  i think emily bront was further narrowed by thebroadness of her religious views but never of course so much asgeorge eliot</s> in any case it is charlotte bront who enters victorian literature</s>  theshortest way of stating her strong contribution is i think this thatshe reached the highest romance through the lowest realism</s>  she did notset out with amadis of gaul in a forest or with mr</s>  pickwick in a comicclub</s>  she set out with herself with her own dingy clothes andaccidental ugliness and flat coarse provincial household andforcibly fused all such muddy materials into a spirited fairytale</s>  ifthe first chapters on the home and school had not proved how heavy andhateful sanity can be there would really be less point in theinsanity of mr</s>  rochesters wifeor the not much milder insanity ofmrs</s>  rochesters husband</s>  she discovered the secret of hiding thesensational in the commonplace and jane eyre remains the best of herbooks better even than villette because while it is a human documentwritten in blood it is also one of the best bloodandthunder detectivestories in the world</s> but while emily bront was as unsociable as a storm at midnight andwhile charlotte bront was at best like that warmer and more domesticthing a house on firethey do connect themselves with the calm ofgeorge eliot as the forerunners of many later developments of thefeminine advance</s>  many forerunners if it comes to that would have feltrather ill if they had seen the things they foreran</s>  this notion of ahazy anticipation of after history has been absurdly overdone as whenmen connect chaucer with the reformation which is like connecting homerwith the syracusan expedition</s>  but it is to some extent true that allthese great victorian women had a sort of unrest in their souls</s>  and theproof of it is that after what i will claim to call the healthier timeof dickens and thackeray it began to be admitted by the great victorianmen</s>  if there had not been something in that irritation we shouldhardly have had to speak in these pages of diana of the crossways orof tess of the durbervilles</s>  to what this strange and very local sexwar has been due i shall not ask because i have no answer</s>  that it wasdue to votes or even little legal inequalities about marriage i feelmyself here too close to

risk while the man was not still running his</s>  but i know nothingabout it nor does anybody else</s> in so short a book on so vast complex and living a subject it isimpossible to drop even into the second rank of good authors whose nameis legion but it is impossible to leave that considerable female forcein fiction which has so largely made the very nature of the modernnovel without mentioning two names which almost brought that secondrank up to the first rank</s>  they were at utterly opposite poles</s>  the onesucceeded by being a much mellower and more christian george eliot theother

quite anaccumulation of true talent as in the childrens tales of mrs</s>  ewingthe historical tales of miss yonge the tales of mrs</s>  molesworth and soon</s>  on a general review i do not think i have been wrong in taking thefemale novelists first</s>  i think they gave its special shape itstemporary twist to the victorian novel</s> nevertheless it is a shock i almost dare to call it a relief to comeback to the males</s>  it is the more abrupt because the first name thatmust be mentioned derives directly from the mere maleness of the sterneand smollett novel</s>  i have already spoken of dickens as the most homelyand instinctive and therefore probably the heaviest of all theonslaughts made on the central victorian satisfaction</s>  there istherefore the less to say of him here where we consider him only as anovelist but there is still much more to say than can even conceivablybe said</s>  dickens as we have stated inherited the old comic ramblingnovel from smollett and the

 pugh and think of him as merely heralding the greatcollectivist revolt against victorian individualism and capitalismwhich seemed so clearly to be the crisis at the end of this epochyouwill suddenly remember the agreeable young barnacle at thecircumlocution office and you will be unable for very shame toassert that dickens would have trusted the poor to a state department</s> dickens did not merely believe in the brotherhood of men in the weakmodern way he was the brotherhood of men and knew it was a brotherhoodin sin as well as in aspiration</s>  and he was not only larger than the oldfactions he satirised he was larger than any of our great socialschools that have gone forward since he died</s> the seemingly quaint custom of comparing dickens and thackeray existedin their own time and no one will dismiss it with entire disdain whoremembers that the victorian tradition was domestic and genuine evenwhen it was hoodwinked and unworldly</s>  there must have been some reasonfor making this imaginary duel between two quite separate and quiteamiable acquaintances</s>  and there is after all some reason for it</s>  itis not as was once cheaply said that thackeray went in for truth anddickens for mere caricature</s>  there is a huge accumulation of truthdown to the smallest detail in dickens he seems sometimes a meremountain of facts</s>  thackeray in comparison often seems quite carelessand elusive almost as if he did not quite know where all his characterswere</s>  there is a truth behind the popular distinction but it lies muchdeeper</s>  perhaps the best way of stating it is this that dickens usedreality while aiming at an effect of romance while thackeray used theloose language and ordinary approaches of romance while aiming at aneffect of reality</s>  it was the special and splendid business of dickensto introduce us to people who would have been quite incredible if he hadnot told us so much truth about them</s>  it was the special and not lesssplendid task of thackeray to introduce us to people whom we knewalready</s>  paradoxically but very practically it followed that hisintroductions were the longer of the two</s>  when we hear of aunt betsytrotwood we vividly envisage everything about her from her gardeninggloves to her seaside residence from her hard handsome face to hertame lunatic laughing at the bedroom window</s>  it is all so minutely truethat she must be true also</s>  we only feel inclined to walk round theenglish coast until we find that particular garden and that particularaunt</s>  but when we turn from the aunt of copperfield to the uncle ofpendennis we are more likely to run round the coast trying to find awateringplace where he isnt than one where he is</s>  the moment one seesmajor pendennis one sees a hundred major pendennises</s>  it is not amatter of mere realism</s>  miss trotwoods bonnet and gardening tools andcupboard full of oldfashioned bottles are quite as true in thematerialistic way as the majors cuffs and corner table and toast andnewspaper</s>  both writers are realistic but dickens writes realism inorder to make the incredible credible</s>  thackeray writes it in order tomake us recognise an old friend</s>  whether we shall be pleased to meet theold friend is quite another matter i think we should be better pleasedto meet miss trotwood and find as david copperfield did a new frienda new world</s>  but we recognise major pendennis even when we avoid him</s> henceforth thackeray can count on our seeing him from his wig to hiswellblacked boots whenever he chooses to say major pendennis paid acall</s>  dickens on the other hand had to keep up an incessantexcitement about his characters and no man on earth but he could havekept it up</s> it may be said in approximate summary that thackeray is the novelistof memoryof our memories as well as his own</s>  dickens seems to expectall his characters like amusing strangers arriving at lunch as if theygave him not only pleasure but surprise</s>  but thackeray is everybodyspastis everybodys youth</s>  forgotten friends flit about the passages ofdreamy colleges and unremembered clubs we hear fragments of unfinishedconversations we see faces without names for an instant fixed for everin some trivial grimace we smell the strong smell of social cliquesnow quite incongruous to us and there stir in all the little rooms atonce the hundred ghosts of oneself</s> for this purpose thackeray was equipped with a singularly easy andsympathetic style carved in slow soft curves where dickens hacked outhis images with a hatchet</s>  there was a sort of avuncular indulgenceabout his attitude what he called his preaching was at worst a sortof grumbling ending with the sentiment that boys will be boys and thattheres nothing new under the sun</s>  he was not really either a cynic or acensor morum but in another sense than chaucers a gentle pardonerhaving seen the weaknesses he is sometimes almost weak about them</s>  hereally comes nearer to exculpating pendennis or ethel newcome than anyother author who saw what he saw would have been</s>  the rare wrath ofsuch men is all the more effective and there are passages in vanityfair and still more in the book of snobs where he does make thedance of wealth and fashion look stiff and monstrous like a babylonianmasquerade</s>  but he never quite did it in such a way as to turn thecourse of the victorian age</s> it may seem strange to say that thackeray did not know enough of theworld yet this was the truth about him in large matters of thephilosophy of life and especially of his own time</s>  he did not know theway things were going he was too victorian to understand the victorianepoch</s>  he did not know enough ignorant people to have heard the news</s>  inone of his delightful asides he imagines two little clerks commentingerroneously on the appearance of lady kew or sir brian newcome in thepark and says how should jones and brown who are not vouscomprenez du monde understand these mysteries</s>  but i think thackerayknew quite as little about jones and brown as they knew about newcomeand kew his world was le monde</s>  hence he seemed to take it forgranted that the victorian compromise would last while dickens whoknew his jones and brown had already guessed that it would not</s> thackeray did not realise that the victorian platform was a movingplatform</s>  to take but one instance he was a radical like dickens allreally representative victorians except perhaps tennyson wereradicals</s>  but he seems to have thought of all reform as simple andstraightforward and all of a piece as if catholic emancipation the newpoor law free trade and the factory acts and popular education were allparts of one almost selfevident evolution of enlightenment</s>  dickensbeing in touch with the democracy had already discovered that thecountry had come to a dark place of divided ways and divided counsels</s> in hard times he realised democracy at war with radicalism andbecame with so incompatible an ally as ruskin not indeed a socialistbut certainly an antiindividualist</s>  in our mutual friend he felt thestrength of the new rich and knew they had begun to transform thearistocracy instead of the aristocracy transforming them</s>  he knew thatveneering had carried off twemlow in triumph</s>  he very nearly knew whatwe all know today that so far from it being possible to plod alongthe progressive road with more votes and more free trade england musteither sharply become very much more democratic or as rapidly becomevery much less so</s> there gathers round these two great novelists a considerable group ofgood novelists who more or less mirror their midvictorian mood</s>  wilkiecollins may be said to be in this way a lesser dickens and anthonytrollope a lesser thackeray</s>  wilkie collins is chiefly typical of histime in this respect that while his moral and religious conceptionswere as mechanical as his carefully constructed fictitious conspiracieshe nevertheless informed the latter with a sort of involuntary mysticismwhich dealt wholly with the darker side of the soul</s>  for this was oneof the most peculiar of the problems of the victorian mind</s>  the idea ofthe supernatural was perhaps at as low an ebb as it had everbeencertainly much lower than it is now</s>  but in spite of this and inspite of a certain ethical cheeriness that was almost de rigueurthestrange fact remains that the only sort of supernaturalism thevictorians allowed to their imaginations was a sad supernaturalism</s>  theymight have ghost stories but not saints stories</s>  they could triflewith the curse or unpardoning prophecy of a witch but not with thepardon of a priest</s>  they seem to have held i believe erroneously thatthe supernatural was safest when it came from below</s>  when we think forexample of the uncountable riches of religious art imagery ritual andpopular legend that has clustered round christmas through all thechristian ages it is a truly extraordinary thing to reflect thatdickens wishing to have in the christmas carol a little happysupernaturalism by way of a change actually had to make up a mythologyfor himself</s>  here was one of the rare cases where dickens in a real andhuman sense did suffer from the lack of culture</s>  for the rest wilkiecollins is these two elements the mechanical and the mystical bothvery good of their kind</s>  he is one of the few novelists in whose case itis proper and literal to speak of his plots</s>  he was a plotter he wentabout to slay godfrey ablewhite as coldly and craftily as the indiansdid</s>  but he also had a sound though sinister note of true magic as inthe repetition of the two white dresses in the woman in white or ofthe dreams with their double explanations in armadale</s>  his ghosts dowalk</s>  they are alive and walk as softly as count fosco but as solidly</s> finally the moonstone is probably the best detective tale in theworld</s> anthony trollope a clear and very capable realist represents ratheranother side of the victorian spirit of comfort its leisureliness itslove of detail especially of domestic detail its love of followingcharacters and kindred from book to book and from generation togeneration</s>  dickens very seldom tried this latter experiment and thenas in master humphreys clock unsuccessfully those magnesium blazesof his were too brilliant and glaring to be indefinitely prolonged</s>  butthackeray was full of it and we often feel that the characters in thenewcomes or philip might legitimately complain that their talk andtale are being perpetually interrupted and pestered by people out ofother books</s>  within his narrower limits trollope was a more strict andmasterly realist than thackeray and even those who would call hispersonages types would admit that they are as vivid as characters</s>  itwas a bustling but a quiet world that he described politics before thecoming of the irish and the socialists the church in the lull betweenthe oxford movement and the modern high anglican energy</s>  and it isnotable in the victorian spirit once more that though his clergymen areall of them real men and many of them good men it never really occursto us to think of them as the priests of a religion</s> charles reade may be said to go along with these and disraeli and evenkingsley not because these three very different persons had anythingparticular in common but because they all fell short of the first rankin about the same degree</s>  charles reade had a kind of cold coarsenessabout him not morally but artistically which keeps him out of the bestliterature as such but he is of importance to the victorian developmentin another way because he has the harsher and more tragic note that hascome later in the study of our social problems</s>  he is the first of theangry realists</s>  kingsleys best books may be called boys books</s>  thereis a real though a juvenile poetry in westward ho</s>  and though thatnarrative historically considered is very much of a lie it is a goodthundering honest lie</s>  there are also genuinely eloquent things inhypatia and a certain electric atmosphere of sectarian excitementthat kingsley kept himself in and did know how to convey</s>  he said hewrote the book in his hearts blood</s>  this is an exaggeration but thereis a truth in it and one does feel that he may have relieved hisfeelings by writing it in red ink</s>  as for disraeli his novels are ableand interesting considered as everything except novels and are animportant contribution precisely because they are written by an alienwho did not take our politics so seriously as trollope did</s>  they areimportant again as showing those later victorian changes which men likethackeray missed</s>  disraeli did do something towards revealing thedishonesty of our politicseven if he had done a good deal towardsbringing it about</s> between this group and the next there hovers a figure very hard toplace not higher in letters than these yet not easy to class withthem i mean bulwer lytton</s>  he was no greater than they were yetsomehow he seems to take up more space</s>  he did not in the ultimatereckoning do anything in particular but he was a figure rather asoscar wilde was later a figure</s>  you could not have the victorian agewithout him</s>  and this was not due to wholly superficial things like hisdandyism his dark sinister good looks and a great deal of the merepolished melodrama that he wrote</s>  there was something in his allroundinterests in the variety of things he tried in his halfaristocraticswagger as poet and politician that made him in some ways a realtouchstone of the time</s>  it is noticeable about him that he is alwaysturning up everywhere and that he brings other people out generally ina hostile spirit</s>  his byronic and almost oriental ostentation was usedby the young thackeray as something on which to sharpen his new razor ofvictorian common sense</s>  his pose as a dilettante satirist inflamed theexecrable temper of tennyson and led to those lively comparisons to abandbox and a lion in curlpapers</s>  he interposed the glove of warning andthe tear of sensibility between us and the proper ending of greatexpectations</s>  of his own books by far the best are the really charmingcomedies about the caxtons and kenelm chillingly none of his otherworks have a high literary importance now with the possible exceptionof a strange story but his coming race is historically interestingas foreshadowing those novels of the future which were afterwards such aweapon of the socialists</s>  lastly there was an element indefinable aboutlytton which often is in adventurers which amounts to a suspicion thatthere was something in him after all</s>  it rang out of him when he said tothe hesitating crimean parliament destroy your government and saveyour army</s> with the next phase of victorian fiction we enter a new world thelater more revolutionary more continental freer but in some waysweaker world in which we live today</s>  the subtle and sad change thatwas passing like twilight across the english brain at this time is verywell expressed in the fact that men have come to mention the great nameof meredith in the same breath as mr</s>  thomas hardy</s>  both writersdoubtless disagreed with the orthodox religion of the ordinary englishvillage</s>  most of us have disagreed with that religion until we made thesimple discovery that it does not exist</s>  but in any age where ideascould be even feebly disentangled from each other it would have beenevident at once that meredith and hardy were intellectually speakingmortal enemies</s>  they were much more opposed to each other than newmanwas to kingsley or than abelard was to st</s>  bernard</s>  but then theycollided in a sceptical age which is like colliding in a london fog</s> there can never be any clear controversy in a sceptical age</s>
nevertheless both hardy and meredith did mean something and they didmean diametrically opposite things</s>  meredith was perhaps the only manin the modern world who has almost had the high honour of rising out ofthe low estate of a pantheist into the high estate of a pagan</s>
 a paganis a person who can do what hardly any person for the last two thousandyears could do a person who can take nature naturally</s>  it is due tomeredith to say that no one outside a few of the great greeks has evertaken nature so naturally as he did</s>  and it is also due to him to saythat no one outside colney hatch ever took nature so unnaturally as itwas taken in what mr</s>  hardy has had the blasphemy to call wessex tales</s> this division between the two points of view is vital because the turnof the nineteenth century was a very sharp one by it we have reachedthe rapids in which we find ourselves today</s> meredith really is a pantheist</s>  you can express it by saying that god isthe great all you can express it much more intelligently by saying thatpan is the great god</s>  but there is some sense in it and the sense isthis that some people believe that this world is sufficiently good atbottom for us to trust ourselves to it without very much knowing why</s>  itis the whole point in most of merediths tales that there is somethingbehind us that often saves us when we understand neither it norourselves</s>  he sometimes talked mere intellectualism about women butthat is because the most brilliant brains can get tired</s>  meredithsbrain was quite tired when it wrote some of its most quoted and leastinteresting epigrams like that about passing seraglio point but notdoubling cape turk</s>  those who can see merediths mind in that are withthose who can see dickens mind in little nell</s>  both were chivalrouspronouncements on behalf of oppressed females neither has any earthlymeaning as ideas</s> but what meredith did do for women was not to emancipate them whichmeans nothing but to express them which means a great deal</s>  and heoften expressed them right even when he expressed himself wrong</s>  takefor instance that phrase so often quoted woman will be the last thingcivilised by man</s>  intellectually it is something worse than false itis the opposite of what he was always attempting to say</s>  so far fromadmitting any equality in the sexes it logically admits that a man mayuse against a woman any chains or whips he has been in the habit ofusing against a tiger or a bear</s>  he stood as the special champion offemale dignity but i cannot remember any author eastern or westernwho has so calmly assumed that man is the master and woman merely thematerial as meredith really does in this phrase</s>  any one who knows afree woman she is generally a married woman will immediately beinclined to ask two simple and catastrophic questions first whyshould woman be civilised</s>  and second why if she is to becivilised should she be civilised by man</s>  in the mere intellectualismof the matter meredith seems to be talking the most brutal sexmastery he at any rate has not doubled cape turk nor even passedseraglio point</s>  now why is it that we all really feel that thismeredithian passage is not so insolently masculine as in mere logic itwould seem</s>  i think it is for this simple reason that there issomething about meredith making us feel that it is not woman hedisbelieves in but civilisation</s>  it is a dark undemonstrated feelingthat meredith would really be rather sorry if woman were civilised bymanor by anything else</s>  when we have got that we have got the realpaganthe man that does believe in pan</s> it is proper to put this philosophic matter first before the stheticappreciation of meredith because with meredith a sort of passing bellhas rung and the victorian orthodoxy is certainly no longer safe</s> dickens and carlyle as we have said rebelled against the orthodoxcompromise but meredith has escaped from it</s>  cosmopolitanismsocialism feminism are already in the air and queen victoria hasbegun to look like mrs</s>  grundy</s>  but to escape from a city is one thingto choose a road is another</s>  the freethinker who found himself outsidethe victorian city found himself also in the fork of two very differentnaturalistic paths</s>  one of them went upwards through a tangled butliving forest to lonely but healthy hills the other went down to aswamp</s>
 meredith became at his best a sort of daintilydressed walt whitman hardy became a sort of village atheist broodingand blaspheming over the village idiot</s>  it is largely because thefreethinkers as a school have hardly made up their minds whether theywant to be more optimist or more pessimist than christianity that theirsmall but sincere movement has failed</s> for the duel is deadly and any agnostic who wishes to be anything morethan a nihilist must sympathise with one version of nature or theother</s>  the god of meredith is impersonal but he is often more healthyand kindly than any of the persons</s>  that of thomas hardy is almost madepersonal by the intense feeling that he is poisonous</s>  nature is alwayscoming in to save merediths women nature is always coming in to betrayand ruin hardys</s>  it has been said that if god had not existed it wouldhave been necessary to invent him</s>  but it is not often as in mr</s> hardys case that it is necessary to invent him in order to prove howunnecessary and undesirable he is</s>  but mr</s>  hardy is anthropomorphicout of sheer atheism</s>  he personifies the universe in order to give it apiece of his mind</s>  but the fight is unequal for the old philosophicalreason that the universe had already given mr</s>  hardy a piece of itsmind to fight with</s>  one curious result of this divergence in the twotypes of sceptic is this that when these two brilliant novelists breakdown or blow up or otherwise lose for a moment their artisticselfcommand they are both equally wild but wild in oppositedirections</s>  meredith shows an extravagance in comedy which if it werenot so complicated every one would call broad farce</s>  but mr</s>  hardy hasthe honour of inventing a new sort of game which may be called theextravagance of depression</s>  the placing of the weak lover and his newlove in such a place that they actually see the black flag announcingthat tess has been hanged is utterly inexcusable in art and probabilityit is a cruel practical joke</s>  but it is a practical joke at which evenits author cannot brighten up enough to laugh</s> but it is when we consider the great artistic power of these twowriters with all their eccentricities that we see even more clearlythat freethought was as it were a fight between fingerposts</s>  for itis the remarkable fact that it was the man who had the healthy and manlyoutlook who had the crabbed and perverse style it was the man who hadthe crabbed and perverse outlook who had the healthy and manly style</s> the reader may well have complained of paradox when i observed abovethat meredith unlike most neopagans did in his way take naturenaturally</s>  it may be suggested in tones of some remonstrance thatthings like though pierced by the cruel acerb or thy fleetingness isbigger in the ghost or her gabbling grey she eyes askant or sheerfilm of the surface awag are not taking nature naturally</s>  and this istrue of merediths style but it is not true of his spirit nor evenapparently of his serious opinions</s>  in one of the poems i have quotedhe actually says of those who live nearest to that nature he was alwayspraising have they but held her laws and nature dear they mouth no sentence of inverted witwhich certainly was what meredith himself was doing most of the time</s> but a similar paradox of the combination of plain tastes with twistedphrases can also be seen in browning</s>  something of the same can be seenin many of the cavalier poets</s>  i do not understand it it may be thatthe fertility of a cheerful mind crowds everything so that the tree isentangled in its own branches or it may be that the cheerful mind caresless whether it is understood or not as a man is less articulate whenhe is humming than when he is calling for help</s> certainly meredith suffers from applying a complex method to men andthings he does not mean to be complex nay honestly admires for beingsimple</s>  the conversations between diana and redworth fail of their fullcontrast because meredith can afford the twopence for diana colouredbut cannot afford the penny for redworth plain</s>  merediths ideals wereneither sceptical nor finicky but they can be called insufficient</s>  hehad perhaps over and above his honest pantheism two convictionsprofound enough to be called prejudices</s>  he was probably of welshblood certainly of celtic sympathies and he set himself more swiftlythough more subtly than ruskin or swinburne to undermining the enormouscomplacency of john bull</s>  he also had a sincere hope in the strength ofwomanhood and may be said almost without hyperbole to have begottengigantic daughters</s>  he may yet suffer for his chivalric interference asmany champions do</s>  i have little doubt that when st</s>  george had killedthe dragon he was heartily afraid of the princess</s>  but certainly neitherof these two vital enthusiasms touched the victorian trouble</s>  thedisaster of the modern english is not that they are not celtic but thatthey are not english</s>  the tragedy of the modern woman is not that she isnot allowed to follow man but that she follows him far too slavishly</s> this conscious and theorising meredith did not get very near his problemand is certainly miles away from ours</s>  but the other meredith was acreator which means a god</s>  that is true of him which is true of sodifferent a man as dickens that all one can say of him is that he isfull of good things</s>  a reader opening one of his books feels like aschoolboy opening a hamper which he knows to have somehow cost a hundredpounds</s>  he may be more bewildered by it than by an ordinary hamper buthe gets the impression of a real richness of thought and that is whatone really gets from such riots of felicity as evan harrington orharry richmond</s>  his philosophy may be barren but he was not</s>  and thechief feeling among those that enjoy him is a mere wish that more peoplecould enjoy him too</s> i end here upon hardy and meredith because this parting of the ways toopen optimism and open pessimism really was the end of the victorianpeace</s>  there are many other men very nearly as great on whom i mightdelight to linger on shorthouse for instance who in one way goes withmrs</s>  browning or coventry patmore</s>  i mean that he has a wide culturewhich is called by some a narrow religion</s>  when we think what even thebest novels about cavaliers have been written by men like scott orstevenson it is a wonderful thing that the author of john inglesantcould write a cavalier romance in which he forgot cromwell butremembered hobbes</s>  but shorthouse is outside the period in fiction inthe same sort of way in which francis thompson is outside it in poetry</s> he did not accept the victorian basis</s>  he knew too much</s> there is one more matter that may best be considered here thoughbriefly it illustrates the extreme difficulty of dealing with thevictorian english in a book like this because of their eccentricitynot of opinions but of character and artistic form</s>  there are severalgreat victorians who will not fit into any of the obvious categories iemploy because they will not fit into anything hardly into the worlditself</s>  where germany or italy would relieve the monotony of mankind bypaying serious respect to an artist or a scholar or a patrioticwarrior or a priestit was always the instinct of the english to do itby pointing out a character</s>  dr</s>  johnson has faded as a poet or acritic but he survives as a character</s>  cobbett is neglectedunfortunately as a publicist and pamphleteer but he is remembered asa character</s>  now these people continued to crop up through the victoriantime and each stands so much by himself that i shall end these pageswith a profound suspicion that i have forgotten to mention a characterof gigantic dimensions</s>  perhaps the best example of such eccentrics isgeorge borrow who sympathised with unsuccessful nomads like the gipsieswhile every one else sympathised with successful nomads like the jewswho had a genius like the west wind for the awakening of wild and casualfriendships and the drag and attraction of the roads</s>  but whether georgeborrow ought to go into the section devoted to philosophers or thesection devoted to novelists or the section devoted to liars nobodyelse has ever known even if he did</s> but the strongest case of this victorian power of being abruptlyoriginal in a corner can be found in two things the literature meantmerely for children and the literature meant merely for fun</s>  it is truethat these two very victorian things often melted into each other aswas the way of victorian things but not sufficiently to make it safeto mass them together without distinction</s>  thus there was georgemacdonald a scot of genius as genuine as carlyles he could writefairytales that made all experience a fairytale</s>  he could give thereal sense that every one had the end of an elfin thread that must atlast lead them into paradise</s>  it was a sort of optimist calvinism</s>  butsuch really significant fairytales were accidents of genius</s>  of thevictorian age as a whole it is true to say that it did discover a newthing a thing called nonsense</s>  it may be doubted whether this thing wasreally invented to please children</s>  rather it was invented by oldpeople trying to prove their first childhood and sometimes succeedingonly in proving their second</s>  but whatever else the thing was it wasenglish and it was individual</s>  lewis carroll gave mathematics a holidayhe carried logic into the wild lands of illogicality</s>  edward lear aricher more romantic and therefore more truly victorian buffoonimproved the experiment</s>  but the more we study it the more we shall ithink conclude that it reposed on something more real and profound inthe victorians than even their just and exquisite appreciation ofchildren</s>  it came from the deep victorian sense of humour</s> it may appear because i have used from time to time the only possiblephrases for the case that i mean the victorian englishman to appear asa blockhead which means an unconscious buffoon</s>  to all this there is afinal answer that he was also a conscious buffoonand a successfulone</s>  he was a humorist and one of the best humorists in europe</s>  thatwhich goethe had never taught the germans byron did manage to teach theenglishthe duty of not taking him seriously</s>  the strong and shrewdvictorian humour

themlaughter</s> but the final proof that the victorians were alive by this laughter canbe found in the fact they could manage and master for a moment even thecosmopolitan modern theatre</s>  they could contrive to put the babballads on the stage</s>
it meant a real victorian talent that of exploding unexpectedly andalmost as it seemed unintentionally</s>  gilbert made good jokes by thethousand but he never in his best days made the joke that couldpossibly have been expected of him</s>  this is the last essential of thevictorian</s>  laugh at him as a limited man a moralist conventionalistan opportunist a formalist</s>  but remember also that he was really ahumorist and may still be laughing at you</s> chapter iiithe great victorian poetswhat was really unsatisfactory in victorian literature is something mucheasier to feel than to state</s>  it was not so much a superiority in themen of other ages to the victorian men</s>  it was a superiority ofvictorian men to themselves</s>  the individual was unequal</s>  perhaps that iswhy the society became unequal i cannot say</s>  they were lame giants thestrongest of them walked on one leg a little shorter than the other</s>  agreat man in any age must be a common man and also an uncommon man</s> those that are only uncommon men are perverts and sowers of pestilence</s> but somehow the great victorian man was more and less than this</s>  he wasat once a giant and a dwarf</s>  when he has been sweeping the sky incircles infinitely great he suddenly shrivels into somethingindescribably small</s>  there is a moment when carlyle turns suddenly froma high creative mystic to a common calvinist</s>  there are moments whengeorge eliot turns from a prophetess into a governess</s>  there are alsomoments when ruskin turns into a governess without even the excuse ofsex</s>  but in all these cases the alteration comes as a thing quite abruptand unreasonable</s>  we do not feel this acute angle anywhere in homer orin virgil or in chaucer or in shakespeare or in dryden such things asthey knew they knew</s>  it is no disgrace to homer that he had notdiscovered britain or to virgil that he had not discovered america orto chaucer that he had not discovered the solar system or to drydenthat he had not discovered the steamengine</s>  but we do most frequentlyfeel with the victorians that the very vastness of the number ofthings they know illustrates the abrupt abyss of the things they do notknow</s>  we feel in a sort of way that it is a disgrace to a man likecarlyle when he asks the irish why they do not bestir themselves andreforest their country saying not a word about the soaking up of everysort of profit by the landlords which made that and every other irishimprovement impossible</s>  we feel that it is a disgrace to a man likeruskin when he says with a solemn visage that building in iron is uglyand unreal but that the weightiest objection is that there is nomention of it in the bible we feel as if he had just said he could findno hairbrushes in habakkuk</s>  we feel that it is a disgrace to a manlike thackeray when he proposes that people should be forcibly preventedfrom being nuns merely because he has no fixed intention of becoming anun himself</s>  we feel that it is a disgrace to a man like tennysonwhen he talks of the french revolutions the huge crusades that hadrecreated the whole of his civilisation as being no graver than aschoolboys barring out</s>  we feel that it is a disgrace to a man likebrowning to make spluttering and spiteful puns about the names newmanwiseman and manning</s>  we feel that it is a disgrace to a

feel it is a disgrace to a man likeswinburne when he has a jingo fit and calls the boer children in theconcentration camps whelps of treacherous dams whom none save we havespared to starve and slay we feel that swinburne for the first timereally has become an immoral and indecent writer</s>  all this is a certainodd provincialism peculiar to the english in that great century theywere in a kind of pocket they appealed to too narrow a public opinioni am certain that no french or german men of the same genius made suchremarks</s>  renan was the enemy of the catholic church but who can imaginerenan writing of it as kingsley or dickens did</s>  taine was the enemy ofthe french revolution but who can imagine taine talking about it astennyson or newman talked</s>  even matthew arnold though he saw this periland prided himself on escaping it did not altogether escape it</s>  theremust be to use an irishism something shallow in the depths of any manwho talks about the zeitgeist as

other events marched or danced</s>  it wasespecially so of tennyson for a reason which raises some of the mostreal problems about his poetry</s>  tennyson of course owed a great dealto virgil</s>  there is no question of plagiarism here a debt to virgil islike a debt to nature</s>  but tennyson was a provincial virgil</s>  in suchpassages as that about the schoolboys barring out he might be called asuburban virgil</s>  i mean that he tried to have the universal balance ofall the ideas at which the great roman had aimed but he hadnt got holdof all the ideas to balance</s>  hence his work

toopictorial</s>  his pictures were too poetical</s>  that is why they reallyconquered the cold satisfaction of the victorians because they did meansomething even if it was a small artistic thing</s> rossetti was one with ruskin on the one hand and swinburne on theother in reviving the decorative instinct of the middle ages</s>  whileruskin in letters only praised that decoration rossetti and hisfriends repeated it</s>  they almost made patterns of their poems</s>  thatfrequent return of the refrain which was foolishly discussed byprofessor nordau was in rossettis case of such sadness as

listened to it they came to the conclusionthat it was a frame of mind they would rather hear about thanexperience</s>  but these later poets did so to speak spread their soul inall the empty spaces

poetry about a real woman andcall her jenny</s>  one has a disturbed suspicion that morris would havecalled her jehanne</s> but all that seems at first more archaic and decorative about morrisreally arose from the fact that he was more virile and real than eitherswinburne or rossetti</s>  it arose from the fact that he really was whathe so often called himself a craftsman</s>  he had enough masculinestrength to be tidy that is after the masculine manner tidy about hisown trade</s>  if his poems were too like wallpapers it was because hereally could make wallpapers</s>  he knew that lines of poetry ought to bein a row as palings ought to be in a row and he knew that neitherpalings nor poetry looks any the worse for being simple or even severe</s> in a sense morris was all the more creative because he felt the hardlimits of creation as he would have felt them if he were not working inwords but in wood and if he was unduly dominated by the mereconventions of the medivals it was largely because they were whateverelse they were the very finest fraternity of free workmen the world isever likely to see</s> the very things that were urged against morris are in this sense part ofhis ethical importance part of the more promising and wholesome turn hewas half unconsciously giving to the movement of modern art</s>  his hazierfellowsocialists blamed him because he made money

epithet andthe unity of the mood</s>  wilde himself wrote some things that were notimmorality but merely bad taste not the bad taste of the conservativesuburbs which merely means anything violent or

this somewhat cool and sad afternoon of the epoch at itspurest not in lounging pessimism or luxurious aberrations but inearnest skill and a high devotion to letters</s>  this change that had comelike the change from a golden sunset to a grey twilight can be veryadequately measured if we compare the insight and intricacy of meredithwith the insight and intricacy of mr</s>  henry james</s>  the

itself to parody and isa glorious feast for mr</s>  max beerbohm</s>  it may be called the hampered orobstacle race style in which one continually trips over commas andrelative clauses and where the sense has to be perpetually qualifiedlest it should mean too much</s>  but such satire however friendly is insome sense unfair to him because it leaves out his sense of generalartistic design which is not only high but bold</s>  this appears ithink most strongly in his short stories in his long novels the readeror at least one reader does get rather tired of everybody treatingeverybody else in a manner which in real life would be an impossibleintellectual strain</s>  but in his short studies there is the unanswerablething called real originality especially in the very shape and point ofthe

sort of pavement orflat foundation under all the victorians</s>  they discussed the dogmasrather than denied them</s>
 now one of the dogmas of macaulay was the dogmaof progress</s>  a fair statement of the truth in it is not really so hard</s> investigation of anything naturally takes some little time</s>  it takessome time to sort letters so as to find a letter it takes some time totest a gasbracket so as to find the leak it takes some time to siftevidence so as to find the truth</s>  now the curse that fell on the latervictorians was this that they began to value the time more than thetruth</s>  one felt so secretarial when sorting letters that one never foundthe letter one felt so scientific in explaining gas that one neverfound the leak and one felt so judicial so impartial in weighingevidence that one had to be bribed to come to any conclusion at all</s>
this was the last note of the victorians procrastination was calledprogress</s> now if we look for the worst fruits of this fallacy we shall find themin historical criticism</s>  there is a curious habit of treating any onewho comes before a strong movement as the forerunner of that movement</s> that is he is treated as a sort of slave running in advance of a greatarmy</s>  obviously the analogy really arises from st</s>  john the baptistfor whom the phrase forerunner was rather peculiarly invented</s>  equallyobviously such a phrase only applies to an alleged or real divineevent otherwise the forerunner would be a founder</s>  unless jesus hadbeen the baptists god he would simply have been his disciple</s> nevertheless the fallacy of the forerunner has been largely used inliterature</s>  thus men will call a universal satirist like langland amorning star of the reformation or some such rubbish whereas thereformation was not larger but much smaller than langland</s>  it wassimply the victory of one class of his foes the greedy merchants overanother class of his foes the lazy abbots</s>  in real history thisconstantly occurs that some small movement happens to favour one of themillion things suggested by some great man whereupon the great man isturned into the running slave of the small movement</s>  thus certainsectarian movements borrowed the sensationalism without thesacramentalism of wesley</s>  thus certain groups of decadents found iteasier to imitate de quinceys opium than his eloquence</s>  unless we graspthis plain common sense that you or i are not responsible for what someridiculous sect a hundred years hence may choose to do with what we saythe peculiar position of stevenson in later victorian letters cannotbegin to be understood</s>  for he was a very universal man and talked somesense not only on every subject but so far as it is logicallypossible in every sense</s>  but the glaring deficiencies of the victoriancompromise had by that time begun to gape so wide that he was forced bymere freedom of philosophy and fancy to urge the neglected things</s>  andyet this very urgency certainly brought on an opposite fever which hewould not have liked if he had lived to understand it</s>  he liked kiplingthough with many healthy hesitations but he would not have liked thetriumph of kipling which was the success of the politician and thefailure of the poet</s>  yet when we look back up the false perspective oftime stevenson does seem in a sense to have prepared that imperial anddownward path</s> i shall not talk here any more than anywhere else in this book aboutthe sedulous ape business</s>  no man ever wrote as well as stevenson whocared only about writing</s>  yet there is a sense though a misleading onein which his original inspirations were artistic rather than purelyphilosophical</s>  to put the point in that curt covenanting way which hehimself could sometimes command he thought it immoral to neglectromance</s>  the whole of his real position was expressed in that phrase ofone of his letters our civilisation is a dingy ungentlemanly businessit drops so much out of a man</s>  on the whole he concluded that what hadbeen dropped out of the man was the boy</s>  he pursued pirates as defoewould have fled from them and summed up his simplest emotions in thattouching cri de cur shall we never shed blood</s>  he did for thepenny dreadful what coleridge had done for the penny ballad</s>  he provedthat because it was really human it could really rise as near toheaven as human nature could take it</s>  if thackeray is our youthstevenson is our boyhood and though this is not the most artisticthing in him it is the most important thing in the history of victorianart</s>  all the other fine things he did were for curious reasons remotefrom the current of his age</s>  for instance he had the good as well asthe bad of coming from a scotch calvinists house</s>  no man in that agehad so healthy an instinct for the actuality of positive evil</s>  in themaster of ballantrae he did prove with a pen of steel that the devilis a gentlemanbut is none the less the devil</s>  it is alsocharacteristic of him and of the revolt from victorian respectabilityin general that his most bloodandthunder sensational tale is alsothat which contains his most intimate and bitter truth</s>  dr</s>  jekyll andmr</s>  hyde is a double triumph it has the outside excitement thatbelongs to conan doyle with the inside excitement that belongs to henryjames</s>  alas it is equally characteristic of the victorian time thatwhile nearly every englishman has enjoyed the anecdote hardly oneenglishman has seen the jokei mean the point</s>  you will find twentyallusions to jekyll and hyde in a days newspaper reading</s>  you will alsofind that all such allusions suppose the two personalities to be equalneither caring for the other</s>  or more roughly they think the book meansthat man can be cloven into two creatures good and evil</s>  the whole stabof the story is that man cant because while evil does not care forgood good must care for evil</s>  or in other words man cannot escapefrom god because good is the god in man and insists on omniscience</s> this point which is good psychology and also good theology and alsogood art has missed its main intention merely because it was also goodstorytelling</s> if the rather vague victorian public did not appreciate the deep andeven tragic ethics with which stevenson was concerned still less werethey of a sort to appreciate the french finish and fastidiousness of hisstyle in which he seemed to pick the right word up on the point of hispen like a man playing spillikins</s>  but that style also had a qualitythat could be felt it had a military edge to it an acies and therewas a kind of swordsmanship about it</s>  thus all the circumstances lednot so much to the narrowing of stevenson to the romance of the fightingspirit but the narrowing of his influence to that romance</s>  he had agreat many other things to say but this was what we were willing tohear a reaction against the gross contempt for soldiering which hadreally given a certain chinese deadness to the victorians</s>  yet anothercircumstance thrust him down the same path and in a manner not whollyfortunate</s>  the fact that he was a sick man immeasurably increases thecredit to his manhood in preaching a sane levity and pugnaciousoptimism</s>  but it also forbade him full familiarity with the actualitiesof sport war or comradeship and here and there his note is false inthese matters and reminds one though very remotely of the mereprovincial bully that henley sometimes sank to be</s> for stevenson had at his elbow a friend an invalid like himself a manof courage and stoicism like himself but a man in whom everything thatstevenson made delicate and rational became unbalanced and blind</s>  thedifference is moreover that stevenson was quite right in claiming thathe could treat his limitation as an accident that his medicines didnot colour his life</s>  his life was really coloured out of a shillingpaintbox like his toytheatre such high spirits as he had are the keyto him his sufferings are not the key to him</s>  but henleys sufferingsare the key to henley much must be excused him and there is much to beexcused</s>  the result was that while there was always a certain daintyequity about stevensons judgments even when he was wrong henleyseemed to think that on the right side the wronger you were the better</s> there was much that was feminine in him and he is most understandablewhen surprised in those little solitary poems which speak of emotionsmellowed of sunset and a quiet end</s>  henley hurled himself into the newfashion of praising colonial adventure at the expense both of thechristian and the republican traditions but the sentiment did notspread widely until the note was struck outside england in one of theconquered countries and a writer of angloindian short stories showedthe stamp of the thing called genius that indefinable dangerous andoften temporary thing</s> for it is really impossible to criticise rudyard kipling as part ofvictorian literature because he is the end of such literature</s>  he hasmany other powerful elements an indian element which makes himexquisitely sympathetic with the indian a vague jingo influence whichmakes him sympathetic with the man that crushes the indian a vaguejournalistic sympathy with the men that misrepresent everything that hashappened to the indian but of the victorian virtues nothing</s> all that was right or wrong in kipling was expressed in the finalconvulsion that he almost in person managed to achieve</s>  the nearest thatany honest man can come to the thing called impartiality is to confessthat he is partial</s>  i therefore confess that i think this last turn ofthe victorian age was an unfortunate turn much on the other side can besaid and i hope will be said</s>  but about the facts there can be noquestion</s>  the imperialism of kipling was equally remote from thevictorian caution and the victorian idealism and our subject does quiteseriously end here</s>  the world was full of the trampling of totally newforces gold was sighted from far in a sort of cynical romanticism theguns opened across africa and the great queen died</s>           of what will now be the future of so separate and almost secretive anadventure of the english the present writer will not permit himselfeven for an instant to prophesy</s>  the victorian age made one or twomistakes but they were mistakes that were really useful that ismistakes that were really mistaken</s>  they thought that commerce outside acountry must extend peace it has certainly often extended war</s>  theythought that commerce inside a country must certainly promoteprosperity it has largely promoted poverty</s>  but for them these wereexperiments for us they ought to be lessons</s>  if we continue thecapitalist use of the populaceif we continue the capitalist use ofexternal arms it will lie heavy on the living</s>
