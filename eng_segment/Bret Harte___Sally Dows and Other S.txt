still been silent</s>  onceor twice it had been crossed by timid hurrying wings and frightenedand hesitating little feet or later by skulkers and stragglers fromthe main column who were tempted to

there were the usual listless blackshadows haunting the veranda and outer officesformer slaves and stillattached houseservants arrested like lizards in breathless attitudesat the approach of strange

the face of the dead young officercoming towards him out of the blue smoke rose as vividly as on thatmemorable day</s>  the picture and letter he had taken from the dead mansbreast which he had retained ever since the romantic and fruitlessquest he had made for the fair original in after days and the strangeand fateful interest in her which had grown up in his heart since thenhe now knew had

dowsfolly as the new experiment was locally called although he had notabated his romantic enthusiasm in the least he was not sorry that hewas able to visit it under a practical pretext</s>  it was rather late nowto seek out miss sally dows with the avowed intent of bringing her aletter from an admirer who had been dead three years and whose memoryshe had probably buried</s>  neither was it tactful to recall a sentimentwhich might have been a weakness of which she was ashamed</s>  yetclearheaded and logical as courtland was in his ordinary affairs hewas nevertheless not entirely free from that peculiar superstition whichsurrounds every mans romance</s>  he believed there was something more thana mere coincidence in his unexpectedly finding himself in such favorableconditions for making her acquaintance</s>  for the restif there was anyresthe would simply trust to fate</s>  and so believing himself acool sagacious reasoner but being actually as far as miss dows wasconcerned as blind fatuous and unreasoning as any of her previousadmirers he rode complacently forward until he reached the lane thatled to the dows plantation</s> here a better kept roadway and fence whose careful repair wouldhave delighted drummond seemed to augur well for the new enterprise</s> presently even the oldfashioned local form of the fence a slantingzigzag gave way to the more direct line of

evidently attending totheir respective duties</s>  dismounting courtland tied his horse to a postat the office door and took the smaller path to the corner house</s> the door was open to the fragrant afternoon breeze wafted through therose and jessamine</s>  so also was a side door opening from the hall intoa long parlor or sittingroom that ran the whole width of the house</s> courtland entered it</s>  it was prettily furnished but everything had theair of freshness and of being uncharacteristically new</s>  it was emptybut a faint hammering was audible on the rear wall of the house

ladder which he gentlyput aside to gain a better view of the courtyard as he put on his hatand stepped out of the open window</s> in this attitude he suddenly felt his hat tipped from his head followedalmost instantaneously by a falling slipper and the distinct impressionof a very small foot on the crown of his head</s>  an indescribablesensation passed over him</s>  he hurriedly stepped

 she backed dexterously so as to keep the slipper behind her butwith no diminution of dignity out of a side door</s>  in another moment thehammering ceased followed by the sound of rapid whispering without afew tiny twigs and leaves slowly rustled to the ground and then therewas complete silence</s>  he ventured to walk to the fateful window again</s> presently he heard a faint rustle at the other end of the room and heturned</s>  a sudden tremulousness swept along his pulses and then theyseemed to pause he drew a deep breath that was almost a sigh andremained motionless</s> he had no preconceived idea of falling in love with miss sally at firstsight nor had he dreamed such a thing possible</s>  even the girlish facethat he had seen in the locket although it had stirred him with asingular emotion had not suggested that</s>  and the ideal he had evolvedfrom it was never a potent presence</s>  but the exquisitely pretty faceand figure before him although it might have been painted from his ownfancy of her was still something more and something unexpected</s>  allthat had gone before had never prepared him for the beautiful girl whonow stood there</s>  it was a poor explanation to say that miss sally wasfour or five years older than her picture and that later experiencesenlarged capacity a different life and new ambition had impressed heryouthful face with a refined mobility it was a weird fancy to imaginethat the blood of those who had died for her had in some vaguemysterious way imparted an actual fascination to her and he dismissedit</s>  but even the most familiar spectator like sophy could see thatmiss sally had the softest pink complexion the silkiest hair thatlooked as the floss of the indian corn might look if curled or goldenspider threads if materialized and eyes that were in bright grayharmony with both that the frock of india muslin albeit homemadefitted her figure perfectly from the azure bows on her shoulders to theribbon around her

that carried this speech was so fresh clear and sweet that iam afraid courtland thought little of its bluntness or its conventionaltransgressions</s>  but it brought him his own tongue quite

charming exaggeration she waved herlittle hand towards the sofa</s> there</s>  yo naturally wanted a little room for that connle but nowthat yo ve got it offand mighty pooty it was tooyo can

young girl who smilingly waived hisproffered hand to help her up and the two gravely set to work</s>  but inthe intervals of hammering and tying up the vines miss sallys tonguewas not idle</s>  her talk was as fresh as quaint as original as herselfand yet so practical and to the purpose of courtlands visit as toexcuse his delight in it and her own fascinating propinquity</s>  whethershe stopped to take a nail from between her pretty lips when she spoketo him or whether holding on perilously with one hand to the trelliswhile she gesticulated with the hammer pointing out the divisions ofthe

againerred on the side of romance or emotion he had never again referred tothe infelix letter and photograph and without being obliged to confinehimself strictly to business affairs he had maintained

small gateway on divergingfrom the road and was quite unprepared to find himself on the edge of agentle slope leading to a beautiful valley and before him a long vistaof tombs white headstones and low crosses edged by drooping cypressand trailing feathery vines</s>  some vines had fallen and been caught inlong loops from bough to bough like funeral garlands and here andthere the tops of isolated palmettos lifted a cluster of hearselikeplumes</s>  yet in spite of this dominance of sombre but graceful shadowthe drooping delicacy of darktasseled foliage and leafy fringesand the waving mourning veils of gray translucent moss a gloriousvivifying southern sun smiled and glittered everywhere as through tears</s> the balm of bay southernwood pine and syringa breathed through thelong alleys the stimulating scent of roses moved with every zephyrand the closer odors of jessamine honeysuckle and orange flowers hungheavily in the hollows</s>  it seemed to courtland like the mourning ofbeautiful

disappearing among the tombs in the direction of the hollow</s> chapter v</s> the house occupied by the manager of the drummond syndicate inredlandsthe former residence of a local lawyer and justice

of the ailantus hungheavy and motionless in the hush of an impending storm</s>  the sparks oflazily floating fireflies softly expanded and went out in the gloom ofthe black foliage or in the dark recesses of the office whose windowswere widely open and whose lights courtland had extinguished when hebrought his armchair to the portico for coolness</s>  one of these sparksbeyond the fence although alternately glowing and paling was still sopersistent and stationary that courtland leaned forward to watch it moreclosely at which it disappeared and a voice from the street saidis that you

speaking to you of dumont</s>  he said hesitatingly missdows french cousin you know</s>  wellhes coming here hes got propertyherethose three houses opposite the court house</s>  from what i hearhes

longreverberating crash of thunder which followed prevented any audiblereply from courtland and covered his agitation</s> for without fully accepting champneys conclusions he was cruellyshocked at the young mans utterance of them</s>
 he had scrupulouslyrespected the wishes of miss sally and had faithfullyalthough neverhopelesslyheld back any expression of his own love since theirconversation in the cemetery</s>  but while his native truthfulness andsense of honor had overlooked the seeming insincerity of her attitudetowards champney he had never justified his own tacit participationin it and the concealment of his own pretensions before his possiblerival</s>  it was true that she had forbidden him to openly enter thelists with her admirers but champneys innocent assumption of hisindifference to her and his consequent half confidences added poignancyto his story</s>  there seemed to be only one way to extricate himselfand that was by a quarrel</s>  whether he did or did not believe champneysstory whether it was only the jealous exaggeration of a rival ormiss sally was actually deceiving them both his position had becomeintolerable</s> i must remind you champney he said with freezing deliberationthat miss miranda dows and her niece now represent the drummond companyequally with myself and that you cannot expect me to listen to anyreflections upon the way they choose to administer their part in itsaffairs either now or to come</s>  still less do i care to discuss theidle gossip which can affect only the private interests of these ladieswith which neither you nor i have any right to

forme but i suppose she was about right</s>  he stopped and then added witha kind of gentle persistency you think she was about right dontyou</s> with what was passing in courtlands mind the question seemed sobitterly ironical that at first he leaned half angrily forward in anunconscious attempt to catch the speakers expression in the darkness</s> i should hardly venture to give an opinion he said after a pause</s> miss dows relations with her neighbors are so very peculiar</s>  and fromwhat you tell me of her cousin it would seem that her desire to placatethem is not always to be depended

champney steppedfrom the portico and reaching the gate seemed to vanish as he hadcome out of the darkness</s> the storm was not yet over the air had again become close andsuffocating</s>  courtland remained brooding in his chair</s>  whether he couldaccept champneys news as true or not he felt that he must end thissuspense at once</s>  a halfguilty consciousness that he was thinking moreof it in reference to his own passion than his duty to the companydid not render his meditations less unpleasant</s>  yet while he couldnot reconcile miss sallys confidences in the cemetery concerning theindifference of her people to champneys attentions with what champneyhad just told him of the reasons she had given him for declining themi am afraid he was not shocked by her peculiar ethics</s>  a lover seldomfinds fault with his mistress for deceiving his rival and is as littleapt to consider the logical deduction that she could deceive him alsoas othello was to accept brabantios warning the

implied compliment in thus allowing herto take the sole ethical responsibility which few women would resist</s> in the midst of this gloomy abstraction courtland suddenly raised hishead and

from the passing obscurations there musthave been twelve or fifteen in all</s> he could no longer doubt their combined intentions nor hesitate how tomeet them</s>  he must at once make for the

less agitated had even regainedsomething of his former emotional combativeness which courtland hadchecked</s>  although far from confident of his henchmans prowess in anemergency the prospect of

lifted his hat ironically waved it to his followers and the nextmoment the whole party were galloping furiously towards the high road</s> for the first time that evening a nervous sense of

said motioning to the cabin</s> thank you he said still half absently</s>  perhaps id better</s>  it maybe some time yet before they come</s> she led the way to the cabin entered the living rooma

with his hand in the breastof his buttoned frock coat gazing silently towards the sea</s>  there wassomething vaguely historical in his attitudeor what she thought mightbe historicalas of somebody of great importance who had halted on theeve of some great event at the door of her humble cabin</s> his apparent unconsciousness of her and of his surroundings hispreoccupation with something far beyond

remained a long time so quiet and unmovedin spite of the marked ostentatious clatter mrs</s>
 bunker found itnecessary to make with her dishes that an odd fancy that he wasscarcely a human visitant began to take possession of her</s>  yet she wasnot frightened</s>  she remembered distinctly afterwards that far fromhaving any concern for herself she was only moved by a strange andvague admiration of him</s> but her prolonged scrutiny was not without effect</s>  suddenly he raisedhis dark eyes and she felt them pierce the obscurity of her kitchenwith a quick suspicious impatient penetration which as they met hersgave way however to a look that she thought was gently reproachful</s> then he rose stretched himself to his full height and approaching thekitchen door leaned listlessly against the doorpost</s> i dont suppose you are ever lonely here</s> no sir</s> of course not</s>  you have yourself and husband</s>  nobody interferes withyou</s>  you are contented and happy together</s> mrs</s>  bunker did not say what was the fact that she had never beforeconnected the sole

but how does it happen you never were in sanfrancisco</s>  he said suddenly</s> if he would not talk of himself here at least was a chance for mrs</s> bunker to say something</s>  she related how her family had emigrated fromkansas across the plains and had taken up a location at contra costa</s> how she didnt care for it and how she came to marry the seafaring manwho brought her hereall with great simplicity and frankness and asunreservedly as to a superior beingalbeit his attention wandered attimes and a rare but melancholy smile that he had apparently evokedto meet her conversational advances became fixed occasionally</s>  even hisdark eyes which had obliged mrs</s>  bunker to put up her hair and buttonher collar rested upon her without seeing her</s> then your husbands name is bunker</s>  he said when she paused at last</s> thats one of those nantucket quaker namessailors and whalers forgenerationsand yours you say was macewan</s>  well mrs</s>  bunker yourfamily came from kentucky to kansas only lately though i suppose yourfather calls himself a freestates man</s>  you ought to know something offarming and cattle for your ancestors were old scotch covenanters whoemigrated a hundred years ago and were great stock raisers</s> all this seemed only the natural omniscience of a superior being</s>  andmrs</s>  bunker perhaps was not pained to learn that her husbands familywas of a lower degree than her own</s>  but the strangers knowledge did notend there</s>  he talked of her husbands businesshe explained the vastfishing resources of the bay and coast</s>  he showed her how the largecolony of italian fishermen were inimical to the interests of californiaand to her husbandparticularly as a native american trader</s>  he toldher of the volcanic changes of the bay and coast line of the formationof the rocky ledge on which she lived</s>  he pointed out to her its valueto the government for defensive purposes and how it naturally commandedthe entrance of the golden gate far better than fort point and that itought to be in its hands</s>  if the federal government did not buy it ofher husband certainly the state of california should</s>  and here he fellinto an abstraction as deep and as gloomy as before</s>  he walked to thewindow paced the floor with his hand in his breast went to the doorand finally stepped out of the cabin moving along the ledge of rocks tothe shore where he stood motionless</s> mrs</s>  bunker had listened to him with parted lips and eyes of eloquentadmiration</s>  she had never before heard anyone talk like thatshe hadnot believed it possible that any one could have such knowledge</s>  perhapsshe could not understand all he said but she would try to remember itafter he had gone</s>  she could only think now how kind it was of him thatin all this mystery of his coming and in the singular sadness that wasoppressing him he should try to interest her</s>  and thus looking at himand wondering an idea came to her</s> she went into her bedroom and took down her husbands heavy pilotovercoat and souwester and handed them to her guest</s> youd better put them on if youre going to stand there she said</s> but i am not cold he said wonderingly</s> but you might be seen she said simply</s>  it was the first suggestionthat had passed between them that his presence there was a secret</s>  helooked at her intently then he smiled and said i think youre rightfor many reasons put the pilot coat over his frock coat removedhis hat with the gesture of a bow handed it to her and placed thesouwester in its stead</s>  then for an instant he hesitated as if aboutto speak but mrs</s>  bunker with a delicacy that she could not herselfcomprehend at the moment hurried back to the cabin without giving himan opportunity</s> nor did she again intrude upon his meditations</s>  hidden in his disguisewhich to her eyes did not however seem to conceal his characteristicfigure he wandered for nearly an hour under the bluff and along theshore returning at last almost mechanically to the cabin whereoblivious of his surroundings he reseated himself in silence bythe table with his cheek resting on his hand</s>  presently her quickexperienced ear detected the sound of oars in their rowlocks she couldplainly see from her kitchen window a small boat with two strangersseated at the stern being pulled to the shore</s>  with the same strangeinstinct of delicacy she determined not to go out lest her presencemight embarrass her guests reception of his friends</s>  but as she turnedtowards the living room she found he had already risen and was removinghis hat and pilot coat</s>  she was struck however by the circumstancethat not only did he exhibit no feeling of relief at his deliverancebut that a halfcynical halfsavage expression had taken the place ofhis former melancholy</s>  as he went to the door the two gentlemen hastilyclambered up the rocks to greet him</s> jim reckoned it was you hangin round the rocks but i couldnt tell atthat distance</s>  seemed you borrowed a hat and coat</s>  wellits all fixedand weve no time to lose</s>  theres a coasting steamer just dropping downbelow

a hurriedwhisper which was stopped again by the voice she knew</s>  no</s>  certainlynot</s>  the next moment his tall figure was darkening the door of thekitchen his hand was outstretched</s>  goodby

bit of jewelry i have about meill be veryglad</s>  goodby</s>  she felt for a moment the firm soft pressure of hislong thin fingers around her own and thenhe was gone</s>  the sound ofretreating oars grew fainter and fainter and was lost</s>  the same reserveof delicacy which now appeared to her as a duty kept her from going tothe window to watch the destination of the boat</s>  no he should go as hecame without her supervision or knowledge</s> nor did she feel lonely afterwards</s>  on the contrary the silence andsolitude of the isolated domain had a new charm</s>  they kept the memory ofher experience intact and enabled her to refill it with his presence</s> she could see his tall figure again pausing before her cabin withoutthe incongruous association of another personality she could hear hisvoice again unmingled with one more familiar</s>  for the first time theregular absence of her husband seemed an essential good fortune insteadof an accident of their life</s>  for the experience belonged to her andnot to him and her together</s>  he could not understand it he would haveacted differently and spoiled it</s>  she should not tell him anything ofit in spite of the strangers suggestion which of course he had onlymade because he didnt know zephas as well as she did</s>  for mrs</s>  bunkerwas getting on rapidly it was her first admission of the conjugalknowledge

the stranger had certainly never saidanything about that</s>  it was a heavy ring with a helmeted head carved onits red carnelian stone and what looked like strange letters around it</s> it fitted her

might be living in apoor cabin doing all the housework herself and her husband only afisherman but he had treated her like a lady</s> and so the afternoon passed</s>  the outlying fog began to roll in

this was unusualfor he was generally as regular as the afternoon trades which blewhim there</s>  there was nothing to detain him in this weather and at thisseason</s>  she began to be vaguely uneasy

pain terror and perplexity at the possibilityher dominant thought was that she would be a free woman to order herlife as she liked</s> it was after ten before his lateen sail flapped in the little cove</s>  shewas waiting to receive him on the shore</s>  his goodhumored hirsute facewas slightly apologetic in expression but flushed and disturbed withsome new excitement to which an extra glass or

got him toinsult henderson so he was bound to challenge marion and that givmarion the chyce of weppings</s>  it was a reglar put up job to kill him</s> and whats all this to do with you</s>  she asked with irritation</s> hold on wont you</s>  and ill tell you</s>  i was pickin up nets offsaucelito about noon when i was hailed by one of them vigilance tugsand they set me to stand off and on the

politician who had held high office in the south he was anaccomplished lawyer he had served in the army he was a fiery speakerhe had a singular command of men</s>  he was unmarried but there were

woman who hadhelped him off</s>  did she speak</s> yes she had spoken</s>  it made her sick to sit there and hear suchstories</s>  because a man did not agree with some people in politics itwas

owned slaves</s>  ofcourse he zephas whose ancestors were cape cod quakers and had alwaysbeen sailors couldnt understand</s>  she did not know what he meant bysaying what a long tail our cats got but if he meant to call hera cat and was going to use such language to her he had better havestayed in san francisco with his vigilance friends</s>  and perhaps it wouldhave been better if he had stayed

was their first quarrel</s>  discreetly made up by mrs</s>  bunker in somealarm at betraying herself honestly forgiven by zephas in a ruderemorseful consciousness of her limited life</s>  one or two nights laterwhen he returned it was with a mingled air of mystery and satisfaction</s> well mollie he said cheerfully it looks as if your pets were notas bad as i thought them</s> my pets</s>

politely</s> i only said good heavens</s>  well</s>  she added impatiently</s> well</s>  repeated uncle sylvester vaguely</s>  oh thats all</s>  i only wantedto explain what i meant by saying i had

very</s>  said cousin jane</s> breakfast over they were not surprised that their sybaritic guestexcused himself from an inspection of the town in the frigid morningair and declined joining a skating party to the lake on the ground thathe could keep warmer indoors with half the exertion</s>  an hour later foundhim standing before the fire in gabriel lanes study looking languidlydown on his elder brother</s> then as far as i can see he said quietly you have made ducks anddrakes of your share of the property and that virtually you are in thehands of this man gunn and his father</s> youre putting it too strongly said gabriel deprecatingly</s>  in thefirst place my investments with gunns firm are by no means failuresand they only hold as security a mortgage on the forest land below thehill</s>  its scarcely worth the money</s>  i would have sold it long ago butit had been a fancy of fathers to keep it wild land for the sake of oldtimes and the healthiness of the town</s> there used to be a log cabin there where the old man had a habit ofcamping out whenever he felt cramped by civilization up here wasntthere</s>  said uncle sylvester meditatively</s> yes said gabriel impatiently its still therebut to return to mr</s> gunn</s>  he has taken a fancy to kitty and even if i could not lift themortgage theres some possibility that the land would still remain inthe family</s> i think ill drive over this afternoon and take a look at the oldshanty if this infernal weather lets up</s> yes but just now my dear sylvester let us attend to business</s>  i wantto show you those investments</s> oh certainly trot em out said his brother plucking up asimulation of interest as he took a seat at the table</s> from a drawer of his desk gabriel brought out a bundle of prospectusesand laid them before uncle sylvester</s> a languid smile of recognition lit up the latters face</s>  ah</s>  yes hesaid glancing at them</s>  the old lot carmelita santa maria

gabriel with an uneasy smile</s>  you dont mean toimply that this stock is old and worthless</s> there isnt a capital in america or europe where for the last fiveyears it hasnt been floated with a new character each time</s>  my deargabriel that stock isnt worth the paper it is printed on</s> but it is impossible that an experienced financier like gunn could bedeceived</s> im sorry to hear that</s> come sylvester</s>  confess youve taken a prejudice against gunn fromyour sudden dislike of his son</s>  and what have you against him</s> i couldnt say exactly said uncle sylvester reflectively</s>  it may behis eyes or only his cravat</s>  but rising cheerfully and placing hishand lightly on his brothers shoulder dont you worry yourself aboutthat stock old man ill see that somebody else has the worry and youthe cash</s>  and as to the land andkittywell you hold on to them bothuntil you find out which the young man is really after</s> and then</s>  said gabriel with a smile</s> dont give him either</s>  but i say havent we had enough business thismorning</s>  lets talk of something else</s>  whos the french girl</s> marie</s>  shes the daughter of jules du pagedont youremember</s> fathers friend</s>  when jules died it was always thoughtthat father who had half adopted her as a child would leave hersome legacy</s>  but you know that father died without making a will andthatrich as he washis actual assets were far less than we had reasonto expect</s>  kitty who felt the disappointment as keenly as her friend ibelieve would have divided her own share with her</s>  its odd by the waythat father could have been so deceived in the amount of his capitalor how he got rid of his money in a way that we knew nothing of</s>  do youknow sylvester ive sometimes suspectedwhat</s>  said uncle sylvester suddenly</s> the bored languor of his face had abruptly vanished</s>  every muscle wasalert his gray eyes glittered</s> that he advanced money to du page who lost it or that they speculatedtogether returned gabriel who following uncle sylvesters voiceonly had not noticed the change of expression</s> that would seem to be a weakness of the lane family said unclesylvester grimly with a return of his former carelessness</s>  but that isnot your own opinionthats a suggestion of some one else</s> well said gabriel with a laugh and a slight addition of color itwas gunns theory</s>  as a man of the world and a practical financier youknow</s> and youve talked with him about it</s> yes</s>  it was a matter of general wonder years ago</s> very likelybut just now dont you think weve had enough financialtalk</s>  said uncle sylvester with a bored contraction of his eyebrows</s> come looking around the room youve changed the interior of the oldhouse</s> yes</s>  unfortunately just after fathers death it was put in the handsof a local architect or builder one of fathers old friends but nota very skillful workman who made changes while the family were away</s> thats why your present bedroom which was fathers old study had aslice taken off it to make the corridor larger and why the big chimneyand hearthstone are still there although the fireplace is modernized</s> that was flints stupidity</s> whose stupidity</s>  asked uncle sylvester trimming his nails</s> flintsthe old architect</s> why didnt you make him change it back again</s> he left lakeville shortly after and i brought an architect from st</s> louis after i returned from europe</s>  but nothing could be done to yourroom without taking down the chimney so it remained as flint left it</s> that reminds me gabriel im afraid i spoke rather cavalierly tokitty last night about the arrangements of the room</s>  the fact is ivetaken a fancy to it and should like to fit it up myself</s>  have i yourpermission</s> certainly my dear sylvester</s> ive some knickknacks in my trunks and ill do it at once</s> as you like</s> and youll see that i am not disturbed and youll explain it to kittywith my apologies</s> yes</s> then im off</s> gabriel glanced at his brother with a perplexed smile</s>  here was thebored traveler explorer goldseeker soldier of fortune actually aspleased as a girl over the prospect of arranging his room</s>  he calledafter him sylvester</s> yes</s> i say if you could you know just try to interest these peopletonight with some of your adventuressomething told seriously youknow as if you really were in earnestid be awfully obliged to you</s> the fact isyoull excuse mebut they think you dont come up toyour reputation</s> they want a story</s> yesone of your experiences</s> ill give them one</s>  tata</s> for the rest of the day uncle sylvester was invisible although hisactive presence in his room was betrayed by the sound of hammering andmoving of furniture</s>  as the remainder of the party were skating onthe lake this eccentricity was not remarked except by onemarie dupagewho on pretense of a slight cold had stayed at home</s>  but with hersuspicions of the former night she had determined to watch the singularrelative of her friend</s>  added to a natural loyalty to the lanes shewas moved by a certain curiosity and fascination towards thisincomprehensible man</s> the house was very quiet when she stole out of her room and passedsoftly along the corridor she examined the wall carefully to discoveranything that might have excited the visitors attention</s>  there were afew large engravings hanging there could he have designed to replacethem by some others</s>  suddenly she was struck with the distinctconviction that the wall of the corridor did not coincide with the wallof his room as represented by the line of the door</s>  there was certainlya space between the two walls unaccounted for</s>  this was undoubtedly whathad attracted his attention but what business was it of his</s> she reflected that she had seen in the wall of the conservatory an oldclosed staircase now used as shelves for dried herbs and seeds whichshe had been told was the oldtime communication between the gardenand grandfather lanes studythe room now occupied by the stranger</s> perhaps it led still farther and thus accounted for the space</s> determined to satisfy herself she noiselessly descended to theconservatory</s>  there surely was the staircasea narrow flight ofwooden steps encumbered with packages of herbslosing itself in upperdarkness</s>  by the aid of a candle she managed to grope and pick her wayup step by step</s>  then she paused</s>  the staircase had abruptly ended onthe level of the study now cut off from it by the new partition</s>  shewas in a stifling inclosure formed by the walls scarcely eighteeninches wide</s>  it was made narrower by a singular excrescence on the oldwall which seemed to have been a bricked closet now half destroyedand in ruins</s>  she turned to descend when a strange sound from unclesylvesters room struck her ear</s>  it was the sound of tapping on thefloor close to the partition within a foot of where she was standing</s> at the same moment there was a decided movement of the plank of theflooring beneath the partition it began to slide slowly and then wasgradually withdrawn into the room</s>  with prompt presence of mind sheinstantly extinguished her candle and drew herself breathlessly againstthe partition</s> when the plank was entirely withdrawn a ray of light slipped throughthe opening revealing the bare rafters of the floor and a hand and arminserted under the partition groping as if towards the bricked closet</s> as the fingers of the exploring hand were widely extended marie had nodifficulty in recognizing on one of them a peculiar signet ring whichuncle sylvester wore</s>  a swift impulse seized her</s>  to the audacious marieimpulse and action were the same thing</s>  bending stealthily over theaperture she suddenly snatched the ring from the extended finger</s>  thehand was quickly withdrawn with a start and uncontrolled exclamationand she availed herself of that instant to glide rapidly down thestairs</s> she regained her room stealthily having the satisfaction a moment laterof hearing uncle sylvesters door open and the sound of his footsteps inthe corridor</s>  but he was evidently unable to discover any outer ingressto the inclosure or believed the loss of his ring an accident for

very act she found it as difficult as ever to believe in hisburglarious design</s>  she must wait</s>  the mischiefif there had beenmischiefwas done the breaking in of the bricked closet was from theappearance of the ruins a bygone act</s>  could it have been some youthfulescapade of uncle sylvesters the scene of which he was revisiting ascriminals are compelled to do</s>  and had there been anything taken fromthe closetor was its destruction a part of the changes in the oldhouse</s>  how could she find out without asking kitty</s>  there was one way</s> she remembered that mr</s>  gunn had once shown a great deal of interestto kitty about the old homestead and even of old mr</s>  lanes woodlandcabin</s>  she would ask him</s>  it was a friendly act for kitty had not oflate been very kind to him</s> the opportunity presented itself at dusk as mr</s>  gunn somewhatabstracted stood apart at the drawingroom window</s>  marie hoped he hadenjoyed himself while skating her stupid cold had kept her indoors</s>  shehad amused herself rambling about the old homestead it was such a queerplace so full of old nooks and corners and unaccountable spaces</s>  justthe place she would think where old treasures might have been stored</s> eh</s> mr</s>  gunn had not spokenhe had only coughed</s>  but in the darkness hiseyes were fixed angrily on her face</s>  without observing it she went on</s> she knew he was interested in the old house she had heard him talkto kitty about it had kitty ever said anything about some old secrethoarding place</s> no certainly not</s>  and she was mistaken he never was interested inthe house</s>  he could not understand what had put that idea in her head</s> unless it was this ridiculous shady stranger in the guise of an unclewhom they had got there</s>  it was like his affectation</s> oh dear no said marie with unmistakable truthfulness he did notsay anything</s>  but with sudden inconsistent aggression is that theway you speak to kitty of her uncle</s> really he didnt knowhe was joking only and he was afraid he mustjust now ask her to excuse him</s>  he had received letters that made itpossible that he might be called suddenly to new york at any moment</s> marie stared</s>  it was evident that he had proposed to kitty and beenrejected</s>  but she was no nearer her discovery</s> nor was there the least revelation in the calm halfbored yetgoodhumored presence of the wicked uncle at dinner</s>  so indifferentdid he seem not only to his own villainy but even to the loss it hadentailed that she had a wild impulse to take the ring from her pocketand display it on her own finger before him then and there</s>  but theconviction that he would in some way be equal to the occasion preventedher</s>  the dinner passed off with some constraint no doubt emanating fromthe conscious kitty and gunn</s>  nevertheless when they had returned tothe drawingroom gabriel rubbed his hands expectantly</s> i prevailed on sylvester this morning to promise to tell us some of hisexperiencessomething complete and satisfactory this time</s>  eh</s> uncle sylvester warming his cold blood before the fire lookedmomentarily forgetful anddisappointing</s>  cousins jane and emma shruggedtheir shoulders</s> eh said uncle sylvester absently ereroh yes</s>  well morecheerfully about what eh</s> let it be said marie pointedly fixing her black magnetic eyes on thewicked stranger let it be something about the discovery of gold or aburied treasure hoard or a robbery</s> to her intense disgust uncle sylvester far from being discomfited

come onfrom oregon before the gold discovery</s>  his name dear me</s> continueduncle sylvester with an effort of memory and apparently beginningalready to lose his interest in the storywaserflint</s> as uncle sylvester paused here cousin jane broke in impatiently</s>  wellthats not an uncommon name</s>  there was an old carpenter here in yourfathers time who was called flint</s> yes said uncle sylvester languidly</s>  but there is or was somethinguncommon about itand thats the point of the story for in the oldtime flint and gunn were of the same stock</s> is this a californian joke</s>  said gunn with a forced smile on hisflushed face</s>  if so spare me for its an old one</s> its much older history mr</s>  gunn said uncle sylvester blandlywhich i remember from a boy</s>  when the first flint traded near saultsainte marie the canadian voyageurs literally translated his name intopierre a fusil and he went by that name always</s>  but when the englishsuperseded the french in numbers and language the name was literallytranslated back again into peter gunn which his descendants bear</s> a labored form of the old joke said gunn turning contemptuouslyaway</s> but the story said cousins jane and emma</s>  the story of the golddiscoverynever mind the names</s> excuse me said uncle sylvester placing his hand in the breast of hiscoat with a delightful exaggeration of offended dignity</s>  but doubtshaving been cast upon my preliminary statement i fear i must declineproceeding further</s>  nevertheless he smiled unblushingly at miss dupage as he followed gunn from the room</s> the next morning those who had noticed the strained relations of misskitty and mr</s>  gunn were not surprised that the latter was recalled onpressing business to new york by the first train but it was a matter ofsome astonishment to gabriel lane and marie du page that uncle sylvestershould have been up early and actually accompanied that gentlemanas far as the station</s>  indeed the languid explorer and goldseekerexhibited remarkable activity and clad in a rough tourist suitannounced over the breakfasttable his intention of taking a longtramp through the woods which he had not revisited since a boy</s>  to thisend he had even provided himself with a small knapsack and for oncerealized kittys ideal of his character</s> dont go too far said gabriel for although the cold has moderatedthe barometer is falling fast and there is every appearance of snow</s> take care you are not caught in one of our blizzards</s> but you are all going on the lake to skate</s>  protested uncle sylvester</s> yes for the very reason that it may be our last chance but should itsnow we shall be nearer home than you may be</s> nevertheless when it came on to snow as gabriel had predicted theskating party was by no means so near home as he had imagined</s>  a shrewdkeenness and some stimulating electric condition of the atmosphere hadtempted the young people far out on the lake and they had ignored thefirst fall of fine grayish granulations that swept along the icy surfacelike little puffs of dust or smoke</s>  then the fall grew thicker the graysky contracted the hurrying flakes dashed against them by a fiercenorthwester were larger heavier and seemed an almost palpable forcethat held them back</s>  their skates already clogged with drift werebeginning to be useless</s>  the bare windswept spaces were becoming rarerthey could only stumble on blindly towards the nearest shore</s>  nor whenthey reached it were they yet safe they could scarcely stand againstthe still increasing storm that was fast obliterating the banks andstretch of meadow beyond</s>  their only hope of shelter was the range ofwoods that joined the hill</s>  holding hands in single file thelittle party consisting of kitty marie and cousins jane andemmastouthearted gabriel leading and cousin john bringing up therearat last succeeded in reaching it and were rejoiced to findthemselves near old lanes halfruined cabin</s>  to their added joy andastonishment whiffs of whirling smoke were issuing from the crumblingchimney</s>  they ran to the crazy door pushed aside its weak fasteningand founduncle sylvester calmly enjoying a pipe before a blazing fire</s> a small pickaxe and crowbar were lying upon a mound of freshly turnedearth beside the chimney where the rotten flooring had been torn up</s> the tumultuous entrance of the skating party required no explanationbut when congratulations had been exchanged the wet snow shaken offand they had drawn round the fire curious eyes were cast upon thesolitary occupant and the pile of earth and debris before him</s> i believe said gabriel laughingly that you have been so bored herethat you have actually played at goldhunting for amusement</s> uncle sylvester took the pipe from his mouth and nodded</s> its a common diversion of yours said marie audaciously</s> uncle sylvester smiled sweetly</s> and have you been successful this time</s>  asked marie</s> i got the color</s> eh</s> uncle sylvester rose and placed himself with his back to the firegently surveying the assembled group</s> i was interrupted in a story of golddigging last evening he saidblandly</s>  how far had i got</s> you were down on the san joaquin river in the spring of 50 with achap named flint chorused cousins jane and emma promptly</s> ah</s>  yes said uncle sylvester</s>  well in those days there was ascarcity of money in the diggings</s>  gold dust there was in plenty but nocoin</s>  you can fancy it was a bother to

lane rose to his feet with an exclamationwhy this is like the louisdor that grandfather saved through the warand gave to father</s> uncle sylvester took the coin back placed it in his left eye like amonocle and winked gravely at the company</s> it is the same</s>  he went on quietly</s>  i was interested for i had agood memory and i remembered that as a boy grandfather had shownme one of those coins and told me he was keeping them for old jules dupage who didnt believe in banks and banknotes</s>  well i traced them toa trader called flint who was shipping gold dust from stockton to

morning</s>  well toreturn</s>  flint only said that he had got them from a man called thompsonwho had got them from somebody else in exchange for goods</s>  a year ortwo afterwards this same thompson happened to be frozen up with me instarvation camp</s>  when he thought he was dying he confessed that he hadbeen bribed by flint to say what he had said but that he believed thecoins were stolen</s>

who took mefor a spirit up aloft there in the moonlight and spread the alarm</s>  thefirst white man they brought me was a wretched drunkard known to theboys as old fusil or fusel oil who went into

knew it could never be missed by the descendants</s>  but through hasteor ignorance he did not touch the papers and documents also hiddenthere</s>  and they told of the existence of grandfathers
