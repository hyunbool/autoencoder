    twice told tales    the vision of the fountain    by nathaniel hawthorneat fifteen i became a resident in a country village more than a hundredmiles from home</s>  the morning after my arrivala september morning butwarm and bright as any in julyi rambled into a wood of oaks with a fewwalnuttrees intermixed forming the closest shade above my head</s>  theground was rocky uneven overgrown with bushes and clumps of youngsaplings and traversed only by cattlepaths</s>
 the track which i chancedto follow led me to a crystal spring with a border of grass as freshlygreen as on may morning and overshadowed by the limb of a great oak</s> one solitary sunbeam found its way down and played like a goldfish inthe water</s> from my childhood i have loved to gaze into a spring</s>
 the water filleda circular basin small but deep and set round with stones some ofwhich were covered with slimy moss the others naked and of variegatedhue reddish white and brown</s>  the bottom was covered with coarse sandwhich sparkled in the lonely sunbeam and seemed to illuminate the springwith an unborrowed light</s>
 in one spot the gush of the water violentlyagitated the sand but without obscuring the fountain or breaking theglassiness of its surface</s>  it appeared as if some living creature wereabout to emergethe naiad of the spring perhapsin the shape of abeautiful young woman with a gown of filmy watermoss a belt ofrainbowdrops and a cold pure passionless countenance</s>
 wherever she laid her hands on grass andflowers they would immediately be moist as with morning dew</s>  thenwould she set about her labors like a careful housewife to clear thefountain of withered leaves and bits of slimy wood and old acorns fromthe oaks above and grains of corn left by cattle in drinking till thebright sand in the bright water were like a treasury of diamonds</s>  butshould the intruder approach too near he would find only the drops of asummer shower glistening about the spot where he had seen her</s>
reclining on the border of grass where the dewy goddess should havebeen i bent forward and a pair of eyes met mine within the waterymirror</s>  they were the reflection of my own</s>  i looked again and lo</s>
 the vision had the aspect of afair young girl with locks of paly gold</s>  a mirthful expression laughedin the eyes and dimpled over the whole shadowy countenance till itseemed just what a fountain would be if while dancing merrily into thesunshine it should assume the shape of woman</s>  through the dim rosinessof the cheeks i could see the brown leaves the slimy twigs the acornsand the sparkling sand</s>  the solitary sunbeam was diffused among thegolden hair which melted into its faint brightness and became a gloryround that head so beautiful</s> my description can give no idea how suddenly the fountain was thustenanted and how soon it was left desolate</s>  i breathed and there wasthe face</s>  i held my breath and it was gone</s>
 had it passed away orfaded into nothing</s>  i doubted whether it had ever been</s> my sweet readers what a dreamy and delicious hour did i spend wherethat vision found and left me</s>  for a long time i sat perfectly stillwaiting till it should reappear and fearful that the slightest motionor even the flutter of my breath might frighten it away</s>  thus have ioften started from a pleasant dream and then kept quiet in hopes towile it back</s>  deep were my musings as to the race and attributes ofthat ethereal being</s>  had i created her</s>  was she the daughter of myfancy akin to those strange shapes which peep under the lids ofchildrens eyes</s>
 or was she a waternymph within the fountain or fairy orwoodland goddess peeping over my shoulder or the ghost of some forsakenmaid who had drowned herself for love</s>  or in good truth had a lovelygirl with a warm heart and lips that would bear pressure stolen softlybehind me and thrown her image into the spring</s> i watched and waited but no vision came again</s>
 i departed but with aspell upon me which drew me back that same afternoon to the hauntedspring</s>  there was the water gushing the sand sparkling and the sunbeamglimmering</s>  there the vision was not but only a great frog the hermitof that solitude who immediately withdrew his speckled snout and madehimself invisible all except a pair of long legs beneath a stone</s>
methought he had a devilish look</s>  i could have slain him</s> thus did the vision leave me and many a doleful day succeeded to theparting moment</s>  by the spring and in the wood and on the hill andthrough the village at dewy sunrise burning noon and at that magichour of sunset when she had vanished from my sight i sought her but invain</s>  weeks came and went months rolled away and she appeared not inthem</s>  i imparted my mystery to none but wandered to and fro or sat insolitude like one that had caught a glimpse of heaven and could take nomore joy on earth</s>
 o had i the burning fancy of my early youth withmanhoods colder gift the power of expression your hearts sweetladies should flutter at my tale</s> in the middle of january i was summoned home</s>
 let me hopethought i or my heart will be as icy as the fountain and the wholeworld as desolate as this snowy hill</s>  most of the day was spent inpreparing for the journey which was to commence at four oclock the nextmorning</s>  about an hour after supper when all was in readiness idescended from my chamber to the sittingroom to take leave of the oldclergyman and his family with whom i had been an inmate</s>
according to their invariable custom so pleasant a one when the fireblazes cheerfully the family were sitting in the parlor with no otherlight than what came from the hearth</s>  as the good clergymans scantystipend compelled him to use all sorts of economy the foundation of hisfires was always a large heap of tan or ground bark which wouldsmoulder away from morning till night with a dull warmth and no flame</s> this evening the heap of tan was newly put on and surmounted with threesticks of redoak full of moisture and a few pieces of dry pine thathad not yet kindled</s>  there was no light except the little that camesullenly from two halfburned brands without even glimmering on theandirons</s>
as people are always taciturn in the dark not a word was said for sometime after my entrance</s>  nothing broke the stillness but the regularclick of the matrons knittingneedles</s>
 were we not like ghosts</s>  dreamy as thescene was might it not be a type of the mode in which departed peoplewho had known and loved each other here would hold communion ineternity</s>  we were aware of each others presence not by sight norsound nor touch but by an inward consciousness</s>
the silence was interrupted by the consumptive daughter addressing aremark to some one in the circle whom she called rachel</s>  her tremulousand decayed accents were answered by a single word but in a voice thatmade me start and bend towards the spot whence it had proceeded</s>
 whom had my heartrecognized that it throbbed so</s>  i listened to catch her gentlebreathing and strove by the intensity of my gaze to picture forth ashape where none was visible</s> suddenly the dry pine caught the fire blazed up with a ruddy glow andwhere the darkness had been there was shethe vision of the fountain</s> a spirit of radiance only she had vanished with the rainbow andappeared again in the firelight perhaps to flicker with the blaze andbe gone</s>  yet her cheek was rosy and lifelike and her features in thebright warmth of the room were even sweeter and tenderer than myrecollection of them</s>  she knew me</s>  the mirthful expression that hadlaughed in her eyes and dimpled over her countenance when i beheld herfaint beauty in the fountain was laughing and dimpling there now</s>
 onemoment our glance mingledthe next down rolled the heap of tan uponthe kindled woodand darkness snatched away that daughter of the lightand gave her back to me no more</s> fair ladies there is nothing more to tell</s>  must the simple mystery berevealed then that rachel was the daughter of the village squire andhad left home for a boardingschool the morning after i arrived andreturned the day before my departure</s>  if i transformed her to an angelit is what every youthful lover does for his mistress</s>  therein consiststhe essence of my story</s>  but slight the change sweet maids to makeangels of yourselves</s> </s>
