strangelyenough less pliable</s>  she did full justice to pescas excellentqualities of heart but she could not accept him implicitly as mymother accepted him for my sake</s>  her insular notions of

younger woman of the two</s> on this occasion for example while the old lady was laughing heartilyover the boyish manner in which we tumbled into the parlour sarah wasperturbedly picking up the broken

his dress mannersand amusements</s>  having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquialexpressions he scattered them about over his conversation wheneverthey happened to occur to him turning them

 the church a drearybuilding of grey stone was situated in a little valley so as to besheltered from the bleak winds blowing over the moorland all round it</s> the burialground advanced from the side of the church a little wayup the slope of the hill</s>  it was surrounded by a rough low stonewall and was bare and open to the sky except at one extremity wherea brook trickled down the stony

once to the churchyard and crossed thestile which led directly to mrs</s>  fairlies grave</s> the grass about it was too short and the ground too hard to show anymarks of footsteps</s>  disappointed thus far i next looked attentivelyat the cross and at the square block of marble below it on which theinscription was cut</s> the natural whiteness of the cross was a little clouded here andthere by weather stains and rather more than one half of the squareblock beneath it on the side which bore the inscription was in thesame condition</s>  the other half however attracted my attention atonce by

outside the door an oldwoman was engaged in washing</s> i walked up to her and entered into conversation about the church andburialground</s>  she was ready enough to talk and almost the firstwords

not seen itat its best</s>  it was her husbands business to look after it but hehad been so ailing and weak for months and months past that he hadhardly been able to crawl into church on sundays to do

towards the brook</s> the little stream ran into the churchyard under a tiny archway in thebottom of the wall and ran out again after a winding course of a fewdozen yards under a similar opening</s>  she dipped the cloth in thewater and returned to the grave</s>  i saw her kiss the white cross thenkneel down before the inscription and apply her wet cloth to thecleansing of it</s> after considering

countenance andgeneral proportion of the featuresin the colour of the hair and inthe little nervous uncertainty about the lipsin the height and sizeof the figure and the carriage of the head and body

engagement by a month in consideration of an unforeseen necessityfor my return to london</s> fortunately for the probability of this excuse so far as appearanceswere concerned the post brought me two letters from london friendsthat morning</s>  i took them away at once to my own room and sent theservant with a message to mr</s>  fairlie requesting to know when i couldsee him on a matter of business</s> i awaited the mans return free from the slightest feeling of anxietyabout the manner in which his master might receive my application</s> with mr</s>  fairlies leave or without it i must go</s>  the consciousness ofhaving now taken the first step on the dreary journey which washenceforth to separate my life from miss fairlies seemed to haveblunted my sensibility to every consideration

the servant returned with a message for which i was not unprepared</s> mr</s>  fairlie regretted that the state of his health on that particularmorning was such as to preclude all hope of his having the pleasure ofreceiving me</s>  he begged therefore that i would accept his apologiesand kindly communicate what i had to say in the form of a letter</s> similar messages to this had reached me at various intervals duringmy three months residence in the house</s>  throughout the whole of thatperiod mr</s>  fairlie had been rejoiced to possess me but had neverbeen well enough to see me for a

compliments to mr</s>  hartright</s>  mr</s>  fairlie is moresurprised and disappointed than he can say in the present state of hishealth by mr</s>  hartrights application</s>  mr</s>  fairlie is not a man ofbusiness but he has consulted his steward who is and that personconfirms mr</s>  fairlies opinion that mr</s>  hartrights request to beallowed to break his engagement cannot be justified by

arranged that miss halcombe was to enter thehouse alone and that i was to wait outside within call</s>  we adoptedthis mode of proceeding from an apprehension that my presence afterwhat had happened in the churchyard the evening before might have theeffect of renewing anne cathericks nervous dread and of rendering heradditionally distrustful of the advances of a lady who was a strangerto her</s>  miss halcombe left me with the intention of speaking in thefirst instance to the farmers wife of whose friendly readiness tohelp her in any way she was well assured while i waited for her inthe near

catherick refuse to see you</s>  i asked in astonishment</s> anne catherick is gone replied miss halcombe</s> gone</s> gone with mrs</s>  clements</s>  they both left the farm at eight oclockthis

anne catherick startled them all by beingsuddenly seized with faintness</s>  she had had a similar attack of aless alarming kind on the day she arrived at the farm and mrs</s>  toddhad connected it on that occasion with something she was reading atthe time in our local newspaper which lay on the farm table and whichshe had taken up only a minute or two before</s> does mrs</s>  todd know what particular passage in the newspaper affectedher in that way</s>  i inquired</s> no replied miss halcombe</s>  she had looked it over and had seennothing in it to agitate any one</s>  i asked leave however to look itover in my turn and at the very first page i opened i found that theeditor had enriched his small stock of news by drawing upon our familyaffairs and had published my sisters marriage engagement among hisother announcements copied from the london papers of marriages inhigh life</s>  i concluded at once that this was the paragraph which hadso strangely affected anne catherick and i thought i saw in it alsothe origin of the letter which she sent to our house the next day</s> there can be no doubt in either case</s>  but what did you hear about hersecond attack of faintness yesterday evening</s> nothing</s>  the cause of it is a complete mystery</s>  there was nostranger in the room</s>  the only visitor was our dairymaid who as itold you is one of mr</s>  todds daughters and the only conversation wasthe usual gossip about local affairs</s>  they heard her cry out and sawher turn deadly pale without the slightest apparent reason</s>  mrs</s>  toddand mrs</s>  clements took her upstairs and mrs</s>  clements remained withher</s>  they were heard talking together until long after the usualbedtime and early this morning mrs</s>  clements took mrs</s>  todd aside andamazed her beyond all power of expression by saying that they must go</s> the only explanation mrs</s>  todd could extract from her guest was thatsomething had happened which was not the fault of any one at thefarmhouse but which was serious enough to make anne catherick resolveto leave limmeridge immediately</s>  it was quite useless to press mrs</s> clements to be more explicit</s>  she only shook her head and said thatfor annes sake she must beg and pray that no one would question her</s> all she could repeat with every appearance of being seriously agitatedherself was that anne must go that she must go with her and that thedestination to which they might both betake themselves must be kept asecret from everybody</s>  i spare you the recital of mrs</s>  toddshospitable remonstrances and refusals</s>  it ended in her driving themboth to the nearest station more than three hours since</s>  she triedhard on the way to get them to speak more plainly but without successand she set them down outside the stationdoor so hurt and offended bythe unceremonious abruptness of their departure and their unfriendlyreluctance to place the least confidence in her that she drove away inanger without so much as stopping to bid them goodbye</s>  that isexactly what has taken place</s>  search your own memory mr</s>  hartrightand tell me if anything happened in the burialground yesterday eveningwhich can at all account for the extraordinary departure of those twowomen this morning</s> i should like to account first miss halcombe for the sudden changein anne catherick which alarmed them at the farmhouse hours after sheand i had parted and when time enough had elapsed to quiet any violentagitation that i might have been unfortunate enough to cause</s>  did youinquire particularly about the gossip which was going on in the roomwhen she turned faint</s> yes</s>  but mrs</s>  todds household affairs seem to have divided herattention that evening with the talk in the farmhouse parlour</s>  shecould only tell me that it was just the newsmeaning i supposethat they all talked as usual about each other</s> the dairymaids memory may be better than her mothers i said</s>  itmay be as well for you to speak to the girl miss halcombe as soon aswe get back</s> my suggestion was acted on the moment we returned to the house</s>  misshalcombe led me round to the servants offices and we found the girlin the dairy with her sleeves tucked up to her shoulders cleaning alarge milkpan and singing blithely over her work</s> i have brought this gentleman to see your dairy hannah said misshalcombe</s>  it is one of the sights of the house and it always doesyou credit</s> the girl blushed and curtseyed and said shyly that she hoped shealways did her best to keep things neat and clean</s> we have just come from your fathers miss halcombe continued</s>  youwere there yesterday evening i hear and you found visitors at thehouse</s> yes miss</s> one of them was taken faint and ill i am told</s>  i suppose nothing wassaid or done to frighten her</s>  you were not talking of anything veryterrible were you</s> oh no miss</s>  said the girl laughing</s>  we were only talking of thenews</s> your sisters told you the news at todds corner i suppose</s> yes miss</s> and you told them the news at limmeridge house</s> yes miss</s>  and im quite sure nothing was said to frighten the poorthing for i was talking when she was taken ill</s>  it gave me quite aturn miss to see it never having been taken faint myself</s> before any more questions could be put to her she was called away toreceive a basket of eggs at the dairy door</s>  as she left us i whisperedto miss halcombeask her if she happened to mention last night that visitors wereexpected at limmeridge house</s> miss halcombe showed me by a look that she understood and put thequestion as soon as the dairymaid returned to us</s> oh yes miss i mentioned that said the girl simply</s>  the companycoming and the accident to the brindled cow was all the news i had totake to the farm</s> did you mention names</s>  did you tell them that sir percival glyde wasexpected on monday</s> yes

explanation and was to give miss halcombe theassistance of his experience in forming her judgment he was to waituntil the question of the marriage was set at rest and his hand ifthat question were decided in the affirmative was to draw thesettlement which bound miss fairlie irrevocably to her engagement</s> even then when i knew nothing by comparison with what i know now ilooked at the family

the sojourn ofsir percival glyde in cumberland and was personally concerned in oneimportant result of his short residence under mr</s>  fairlies roof</s>  itis my duty therefore to add these new links

object was to remain at mr</s>  fairlies until the arrival of sirpercival glyde</s>  if that event led to the appointment of any given dayfor sir percivals union with miss fairlie i was to take the

again and again to the subject</s>  all i could ascertain wasthat he looked on his nieces marriage as a settled thing that herfather had sanctioned it that he sanctioned it himself that it was adesirable marriage and that he should be personally rejoiced when theworry of it was over</s>  as to the settlements if i would consult hisniece and afterwards dive as deeply as i pleased into my own

have been a little astonished at this extraordinaryabsence of all selfassertion on mr</s>  fairlies part in the characterof guardian if my knowledge of the family affairs had not beensufficient to remind me that he was a single man and that he hadnothing more than a lifeinterest in the limmeridge property</s>  asmatters stood therefore i was neither surprised nor disappointed atthe result of the interview</s>  mr</s>  fairlie had simply justified myexpectationsand there was an end of it</s> sunday was a dull day out of doors and in</s>  a letter arrived for mefrom sir percival glydes

him to be a most prepossessing man so far as manners andappearance were concerned</s>  he looked rather older than i had expectedhis head being bald over the forehead and his face somewhat marked andworn but his movements were as active and his spirits as high as ayoung mans</s>  his meeting with miss halcombe was delightfully heartyand unaffected and his reception of me upon my being presented tohim was so easy and pleasant that we got on together like old friends</s> miss fairlie was not with us when he arrived but she entered the roomabout ten minutes afterwards</s>  sir percival rose and paid hiscompliments with perfect grace</s>  his evident concern on seeing thechange for the worse in the young ladys looks was expressed with amixture of tenderness and respect with an unassuming delicacy of tonevoice and manner which did equal credit to his good breeding and hisgood sense</s>  i was rather surprised under these circumstances to seethat miss fairlie continued to be constrained and uneasy in hispresence and that she took the first opportunity of leaving the roomagain</s>  sir percival neither noticed the restraint in her reception ofhim nor her sudden withdrawal from our society</s>  he had not obtrudedhis attentions on her while she was present and he did not embarrassmiss halcombe by any allusion to her departure when she was gone</s>  histact and taste were never at fault on this or on any other occasionwhile i was in his company at limmeridge house</s> as soon as miss fairlie had left the room he spared us allembarrassment on the subject

cumberland anxious to satisfy our minds bythe speediest and the fullest explanation that words could convey</s>  onhearing him express himself to this effect i offered him the originalletter which i had kept for his inspection</s>  he thanked me anddeclined to look at it saying that he had seen the copy and that hewas quite willing to leave the original in our hands</s> the statement itself on

property wassituated he had taken care not to lose sight of herhis friendlyfeeling towards the poor woman in consideration of her past serviceshaving been greatly strengthened by his admiration of the patience andcourage with which she supported her calamities</s>  in course of time thesymptoms of mental affliction in her unhappy daughter increased to sucha serious extent as to make it a matter of necessity to place herunder proper medical care</s>  mrs</s>  catherick herself recognised thisnecessity but she also felt the prejudice common to persons occupyingher respectable station against allowing her child to be admitted asa pauper into a public asylum</s>  sir percival had respected thisprejudice as he respected honest independence of feeling in any rankof life and had resolved to mark his grateful sense of mrs</s> cathericks early attachment to the interests of himself and hisfamily by defraying the expense of her daughters maintenance in atrustworthy private asylum</s>  to her mothers regret and to his ownregret the unfortunate creature had discovered the share whichcircumstances had induced him to take in placing her under restraintand had conceived the most intense

mentioned as well as the names and addresses of the twodoctors on whose certificates the patient was admitted he was readyto answer any question and to clear up any uncertainty</s>  he had donehis duty to the unhappy young woman by instructing his solicitor tospare no expense in tracing her and in restoring her once more tomedical care and he was now only anxious to do his duty towards

that it can dispute anyhuman statement made under any circumstances and reduced to any form</s> if i had felt professionally called upon to set up a case against sirpercival glyde on the strength of his own explanation i could havedone so beyond all doubt</s>  but my duty did not lie in thisdirectionmy function was of the purely judicial kind</s>  i was to weighthe explanation we had just heard to allow all due force to the highreputation of the gentleman who offered it and to decide honestlywhether the probabilities on sir percivals own showing were plainlywith him or plainly against him</s>  my own conviction was that they wereplainly with him and i accordingly declared that his explanation wasto my mind unquestionably a satisfactory one</s> miss halcombe after looking at me very earnestly said a few words onher side to the same effectwith a certain hesitation of mannerhowever which the circumstances did not seem to me to warrant</s>  i amunable to say positively whether sir percival noticed this or not</s> my opinion is that he did seeing that he pointedly resumed thesubject although he might now with all propriety have allowed it todrop</s> if my plain statement of facts had only been addressed to mr</s> gilmore he said i should consider any further reference to thisunhappy matter as unnecessary</s>  i may fairly expect mr</s>  gilmore as agentleman to believe

together</s> we began the ride by talking about anne catherick and about thesingular manner in which mr</s>  hartright met with her</s>  but we soondropped that subject and sir percival spoke next in the mostunselfish terms of his engagement with laura</s>  he said he had observedthat she was out of spirits and he was willing if not informed to thecontrary to attribute to that cause the alteration in her mannertowards him during his present visit</s>  if however there was any moreserious reason for the change he would entreat that no constraintmight be placed on her inclinations either by mr</s>  fairlie or by me</s> all he asked in that case was that she would recall to mind for thelast time what the circumstances were under which the engagementbetween them was made and what his conduct had been from the beginningof the courtship to the present time</s>  if after due reflection onthose two subjects she seriously desired that he should withdraw hispretensions to the honour of becoming her husbandand if she wouldtell him so plainly with her own lipshe would sacrifice himself byleaving her perfectly free to withdraw from the engagement</s> no man could say more than that

the consequencesmay be sir percival has a right to expect that your sister shouldcarefully consider her engagement from every reasonable point of viewbefore she claims her release from it</s>  if that unlucky letter hasprejudiced her against him go at once and tell her that he hascleared himself in your eyes and in mine</s>  what objection can she urgeagainst him after that</s>  what excuse can she

beforeher in the right point of view but when miss halcombe next proceededto say that the object of sir percivals visit at limmeridge was toprevail on her to let a day be fixed for the marriage she checked allfurther reference to the subject by begging for time</s>  if sir percivalwould consent to spare her for the present she would undertake to givehim his final answer before the end of the year</s>  she pleaded for thisdelay with such anxiety and agitation that miss halcombe had promisedto use her influence if necessary to obtain it and there at missfairlies earnest entreaty all further

these lines</s>  that mornings post hadbrought a letter from my partner which obliged me to return to townthe next day by the afternoon train</s>  it was extremely probable that ishould find no second

told me that sirpercival had left cumberland to return to his house in hampshire andin two concluding sentences she informed me first that laura wassadly in want of change and cheerful society

narrative succeeds mine shewill describe them in every particular exactly as they happened</s>  inthe meantime the plain duty for me to performbefore i in my turnlay down my pen and withdraw from the storyis to relate the oneremaining event connected with miss fairlies proposed marriage inwhich i was concerned namely the drawing of the settlement</s> it is impossible to refer intelligibly to this document without firstentering into certain particulars in relation to the brides pecuniaryaffairs</s>  i will try to make my explanation briefly and plainly and tokeep it free from professional obscurities and technicalities</s>  thematter is of the utmost importance</s>  i warn all readers of these linesthat miss fairlies inheritance is a very serious part of missfairlies story and that mr</s>  gilmores experience in this particularmust be their experience also if they wish to understand thenarratives which are yet to come</s> miss fairlies expectations then were of a twofold kind comprisingher possible inheritance of real property or land when her uncledied and her absolute inheritance of personal property or money whenshe came of age</s> let us take the land first</s> in the time of miss fairlies paternal grandfather whom we will callmr</s>  fairlie the elder the entailed succession to the limmeridgeestate stood thusmr</s>  fairlie the elder died and left three sons philip frederickand arthur</s>  as eldest son philip succeeded to the estate if he diedwithout leaving a son the property went to the second brotherfrederick and if frederick died also without leaving a son theproperty went to the third brother arthur</s> as events turned out mr</s>  philip fairlie died leaving an only daughterthe laura of this story and the estate in consequence went incourse of law to the second brother frederick a single man</s>  thethird brother arthur had died many years before the decease ofphilip leaving a son and a daughter</s>  the son at the age of eighteenwas drowned at oxford</s>  his death left laura the daughter of mr</s> philip fairlie presumptive heiress to the estate with every chance ofsucceeding to it in the ordinary course of nature on her unclefredericks death if the said frederick died without leaving maleissue</s> except in the event then of mr</s>  frederick fairlies marrying andleaving an heir the two very last things in the world that he waslikely to do his niece laura would have the property on his deathpossessing it must be remembered nothing more than a lifeinterest init</s>  if she died single or died childless the estate would revert toher cousin magdalen the daughter of mr</s>  arthur fairlie</s>  if shemarried with a proper settlementor in other words with thesettlement i meant to make for herthe income from the estate a goodthree thousand a year would during her lifetime be at her owndisposal</s>  if she died before her husband he would naturally expect tobe left in the enjoyment of the income for his lifetime</s>  if she had ason that son would be the heir to the exclusion of her cousinmagdalen</s>  thus sir percivals prospects in marrying miss fairlie sofar as his wifes expectations from real property were concernedpromised him these two advantages on mr</s>  frederick fairlies deathfirst the use of three thousand a year by his wifes permissionwhile she lived and in his own right on her death if he survivedher and secondly the inheritance of limmeridge for his son if hehad one</s> so much for the landed property and for the disposal of the incomefrom it on the occasion of miss fairlies marriage</s>  thus far nodifficulty or difference of opinion on the ladys settlement was at alllikely to arise between sir percivals lawyer and myself</s> the personal estate or in other words the money to which missfairlie would become entitled on reaching the age of twentyone yearsis the next point to consider</s> this part of her inheritance was in itself a comfortable littlefortune</s>  it was derived under her fathers will and it amounted tothe sum of twenty thousand pounds</s>  besides this she had alifeinterest in ten thousand pounds more which latter amount was togo on her decease to her aunt eleanor her fathers only sister</s>  itwill greatly assist in setting the family affairs before the reader inthe clearest possible light if i stop here for a moment to explainwhy the aunt had been kept waiting for her legacy until the death ofthe niece</s> mr</s>  philip fairlie had lived on excellent terms with his sistereleanor as long as she remained a single woman</s>  but when her marriagetook place somewhat late in life and when that marriage united her toan italian gentleman named fosco or rather to an italiannoblemanseeing that he rejoiced in the title of countmr</s>  fairliedisapproved of her conduct so strongly that he ceased to hold anycommunication with her and even went the length of striking her nameout of his will</s>  the other members of the family all thought thisserious manifestation of resentment at his sisters marriage more orless unreasonable</s>  count fosco though not a rich man was not apenniless adventurer either</s>  he had a small but sufficient income ofhis own</s>  he had lived many years in england and he held an excellentposition in society</s>  these recommendations however availed nothingwith mr</s>  fairlie</s>  in many of his opinions he was an englishman of theold school and he hated a foreigner simply and solely because he was aforeigner</s>  the utmost that he could be prevailed on to do in afteryearsmainly at miss fairlies intercessionwas to restore hissisters name to its former place in his will but to keep her waitingfor her legacy by giving the income of the money to his daughter forlife and the money itself if her aunt died before her to her cousinmagdalen</s>  considering the relative ages of the two ladies the auntschance in the ordinary course of nature of receiving the ten thousandpounds was thus rendered doubtful in the extreme and madame foscoresented her brothers treatment of her as unjustly as usual in suchcases by refusing to see her niece and declining to believe that missfairlies intercession had ever been exerted to restore her name to mr</s> fairlies will</s> such was the history of the ten thousand pounds</s>  here again nodifficulty could arise with sir percivals legal adviser</s>  the incomewould be at the wifes disposal and the principal would go to her auntor her cousin on her death</s> all preliminary explanations being now cleared out of the way i comeat last to the real knot of the caseto the twenty thousand pounds</s> this sum was absolutely miss fairlies own on her completing hertwentyfirst year and the whole future disposition of it depended inthe first instance on the conditions i could obtain for her in hermarriagesettlement</s>  the other clauses contained in that document wereof a formal kind and need not be recited here</s>  but the clauserelating to the money is too important to be passed over</s>  a few lineswill be sufficient to give the necessary abstract of it</s> my stipulation in regard to the twenty thousand pounds was simply thisthe whole amount was to be settled so as to give the income to the ladyfor her lifeafterwards to sir percival for his lifeand theprincipal to the children of the marriage</s>  in default of issue theprincipal was to be disposed of as the lady might by her will directfor which purpose i reserved to her the right of making a will</s>  theeffect of these conditions may be thus summed up</s>  if lady glyde diedwithout leaving children her halfsister miss halcombe and any otherrelatives or friends whom she might be anxious to benefit would onher husbands death divide among them such shares of her money as shedesired them to have</s>  if on the other hand she died leavingchildren then their interest naturally and necessarily supersededall other interests whatsoever</s>  this was the clauseand no one whoreads it can fail i think to agree with me that it meted out equaljustice to all parties</s> we shall see how my proposals were met on the husbands side</s> at the time when miss halcombes letter reached me i was even morebusily occupied than usual</s>  but i contrived to make leisure for thesettlement</s>  i had drawn it and had sent it for approval to sirpercivals solicitor in less than a week from the time when misshalcombe had informed me of the proposed marriage</s> after a lapse of two days the document was returned to me with notesand remarks of the baronets lawyer</s>  his objections in generalproved to be of the most trifling and technical kind until he came tothe clause relating to the twenty thousand pounds</s>  against this therewere double lines drawn in red ink and the following note was appendedto themnot admissible</s>  the principal to go to sir percival glyde in theevent of his surviving lady glyde and there being no issue</s> that is to say not one farthing of the twenty thousand pounds was togo to miss halcombe or to any other relative or friend of ladyglydes</s>  the whole sum if she left no children was to slip into thepockets of her husband</s> the answer i wrote to this audacious proposal was as short and sharp asi could make it</s>  my dear sir</s>  miss fairlies settlement</s>  i

as it stood notonly urging every argument i could think of to induce him to maintainthe clause as i had drawn it but stating to him plainly the mercenarymotive which was at the bottom of the opposition to my settlement ofthe twenty thousand pounds</s>  the knowledge of sir percivals affairswhich i had necessarily gained when the provisions of the deed on hisside were submitted in due course to my examination had but tooplainly informed me that the debts on his estate were enormous andthat his income though nominally a large one was virtually for a manin his position next to nothing</s>  the want of ready money was thepractical necessity of sir percivals existence and his lawyers noteon the clause in the settlement was nothing but the frankly selfishexpression of it</s> mr</s>  fairlies answer reached me by return of post and proved to bewandering and irrelevant in the extreme</s>  turned into plain english itpractically expressed itself to this effect would dear gilmore be sovery obliging as not to worry his friend and client about such a trifleas a remote contingency</s>  was it likely that a young woman of twentyonewould die before a man of forty five and die without children</s>  on theother hand in such a miserable world as this was it possible tooverestimate the value of peace and quietness</s>  if those two heavenlyblessings were offered in exchange for such an earthly trifle as aremote chance of twenty thousand pounds was it not a fair bargain</s> surely yes</s>  then why not make it</s> i threw the letter away in disgust</s>  just as it had fluttered to theground there was a knock at my door and sir percivals solicitor mr</s> merriman was shown in</s>  there are many varieties of sharppractitioners in this world but i think the

little</s>  but i saw one of his feetsoftly quietly incessantly beating on the carpet under the table andi felt that he was secretly as anxious as ever</s> i have not forgotten she said that you asked my fatherspermission before you honoured me with a proposal of marriage</s>  perhapsyou have not forgotten either what i said when i consented to ourengagement</s>  i ventured to tell you that my

this lamentable marriage</s>  she interposed gently but firmly inthe middle of my remonstrances</s> i left yesterday to decide she said and yesterday has decided</s>  itis too late to go back</s> sir percival spoke to me this afternoon about what had passed inlauras room</s>  he assured me that the unparalleled trust she had placedin him had awakened such an answering conviction of her innocence andintegrity in his mind that he was guiltless of having felt even amoments unworthy jealousy either at the time when he was in herpresence or afterwards when he had withdrawn from it</s>  deeply as helamented the unfortunate attachment which had hindered the progress hemight otherwise have made in her esteem and regard he firmly believedthat it had remained unacknowledged in the past and that it wouldremain under all changes of circumstance which it was possible tocontemplate unacknowledged in the future</s>  this was his absoluteconviction and the strongest proof he could give of it was theassurance which he now offered that he felt no curiosity to knowwhether the attachment was of recent date or not or who had been theobject of it</s>  his implicit confidence in miss fairlie made himsatisfied with what she had thought fit to say to him and he washonestly innocent of the slightest feeling of anxiety to hear more</s> he waited after saying those words and looked at me</s>  i was

opportunityof trying to plead lauras cause and i told him boldly that iregretted his generosity had not carried him one step farther andinduced him to withdraw from the engagement altogether</s> here again he disarmed me by not attempting to defend himself</s>  hewould merely beg me to remember the difference there was between hisallowing miss fairlie to give him up which was a matter of submissiononly and his forcing himself to give up miss fairlie which was inother words asking him to be the suicide of his own hopes</s>  herconduct of the day before had so strengthened the unchangeable love andadmiration of two long years that all active contention against thosefeelings on his part was henceforth entirely out of his power</s>  imust think him weak selfish unfeeling towards the very woman whom heidolised and he must bow to my opinion as resignedly as he couldonlyputting it to me at the same time whether her future as a singlewoman pining under an unhappily placed attachment which she couldnever acknowledge could be said to promise her a much brighterprospect than her future as the wife of a man who worshipped the veryground she walked on</s>  in the last case there was hope from timehowever slight it might bein the first case on her own showingthere was no hope at all</s> i answered himmore because my tongue is a womans and must answerthan because i had anything convincing to say</s>  it was only too plainthat the course laura had adopted the day before had offered him theadvantage if he chose to take itand that he had chosen to take it</s>  ifelt this at the time and i feel it just as strongly now while iwrite these lines in my own room</s>  the one hope left is that hismotives really spring as he says they do from the irresistiblestrength of

wings are added at eitherend of it</s>  the halfruined wing on the left as you approach thehouse was once a place of residence standing by itself and was builtin the fourteenth century</s>  one of sir

of the old wing bothoutside and inside was considered remarkably fine by good judges</s>  onfurther investigation i discovered that good judges could only exercisetheir abilities on sir percivals piece of antiquity by previouslydismissing from their minds all fear of damp darkness and rats</s>  underthese circumstances i unhesitatingly acknowledged myself to be nojudge at all and suggested that we should treat the old wingprecisely as we had previously treated the elizabethan bedrooms</s>  oncemore the housekeeper said i am quite of your opinion miss and oncemore she looked at me with undisguised admiration of my extraordinarycommonsense</s> we went next to the wing on the right which was built by way ofcompleting the wonderful architectural jumble at blackwater park inthe time of

dirty good old times out of the way of ourdaily life</s> i dawdled away the morningpart of the time in the rooms downstairsand part out of doors in the great square which is formed by the threesides of the house and by the lofty iron railings and gates whichprotect it in front</s>  a large circular fishpond with stone sides andan allegorical leaden monster in the middle occupies the centre of thesquare</s>  the pond itself is full of gold and silver fish and isencircled by a broad belt of the softest turf i ever walked on</s>  iloitered here on the shady side pleasantly enough till luncheontimeand after that took my broad straw hat and wandered out alone in thewarm lovely sunlight to explore the grounds</s> daylight confirmed the impression which i had felt the night before ofthere being too many trees at blackwater</s>  the house is stifled bythem</s>  they are for the most part young and planted far too thickly</s> i suspect there must have been a ruinous cutting down of timber allover the estate before sir percivals time and an angry anxiety on thepart of the next possessor to fill up all the gaps as thickly andrapidly as possible</s>  after looking about me in front of the house iobserved a flowergarden on my left hand and walked towards it to seewhat i could discover in that direction</s> on a nearer view the garden proved to be small and poor and ill kept</s> i left it behind me opened a little gate in a ring fence and foundmyself in a plantation of firtrees</s> a pretty winding path artificially made led me on among the treesand my northcountry experience soon informed me that i was approachingsandy heathy ground</s>  after a walk of more than half a mile i shouldthink among the firs the path took a sharp turnthe trees abruptlyceased to appear on either side of me and i found myself standingsuddenly on the margin of a vast open space and looking down at theblackwater lake from which the house takes its name</s> the ground shelving away below me was all sand with a few littleheathy hillocks to break the monotony of it in certain places</s>  thelake itself had evidently once flowed to the spot on which i stood andhad been gradually wasted and dried up to less than a third of itsformer size</s>  i saw its still stagnant waters a quarter of a mileaway from me in the hollow separated into pools and ponds by twiningreeds and rushes and little knolls of earth</s>  on the farther bank fromme the trees rose thickly again and shut out the view and cast theirblack shadows on the sluggish shallow water</s>  as i walked down to thelake i saw that the ground on its farther side was damp and marshyovergrown with rank grass and dismal willows</s>  the water which wasclear enough on the open sandy side where the sun shone looked blackand poisonous opposite to me where it lay deeper under the shade ofthe spongy banks and the rank overhanging thickets and tangled trees</s> the frogs were croaking and the rats were slipping in and out of theshadowy water like live shadows themselves as i got nearer to themarshy side of the lake</s>  i saw here lying half in and half out of thewater the rotten wreck of an old overturned boat with a sickly spotof sunlight glimmering through a gap in the trees on its dry surfaceand a snake basking in the midst of the spot fantastically coiled andtreacherously still</s>  far and near the view suggested the same drearyimpressions of solitude and decay and the glorious brightness of thesummer sky overhead seemed only to deepen and harden the gloom andbarrenness of the wilderness on which it shone</s>  i turned and retracedmy steps to the high heathy ground directing them a little aside frommy former path towards a shabby old wooden shed which stood on theouter skirt of the fir plantation and which had hitherto been toounimportant to share my notice with the wide wild prospect of the lake</s> on approaching the shed i found that it had once been a boathouseand that an attempt had apparently been made to convert it afterwardsinto a sort of rude arbour by placing inside it a firwood seat a fewstools and a table</s>  i entered the place and sat down for a littlewhile to rest and get my breath again</s> i had not been in the boathouse more than a minute when it struck methat the sound of my own quick breathing was very strangely echoed

shaken bytrifles but on this occasion i started to my feet in a frightcalledoutreceived no answersummoned back my recreant courage and lookedunder the seat</s> there crouched up in the farthest corner

seat and looked closer</s>  the poorlittle dogs eyes were glazing fast and there were spots of blood onits glossy white side</s>  the misery of a weak helpless dumb creatureis surely one of the saddest of all the mournful sights which thisworld can show</s>  i lifted the poor dog in my arms as gently as i couldand contrived a sort of makeshift hammock for him to lie in bygathering up the front of my dress all round him</s>  in this way i tookthe creature as painlessly as possible and as fast as possible backto the house</s> finding no one in the hall i went up at once to my own

are generally turned on her husband with the lookof mute submissive inquiry which we are all familiar with in the eyesof a faithful dog</s>  the only approach to an inward thaw which i haveyet

this time i have alwaysespecially disliked corpulent humanity</s>  i have always maintained thatthe popular notion of connecting excessive grossness of size andexcessive goodhumour as inseparable allies was equivalent todeclaring either that no people but amiable people ever get fat orthat the accidental addition of so many pounds of flesh has a directlyfavourable influence over the disposition of the person on whose bodythey accumulate</s>  i have invariably combated both these absurdassertions by quoting examples of fat people who were as mean viciousand cruel as the leanest

cold clear beautifulirresistible glitter in them which forces me to look at him and yetcauses me sensations when i do look which i would rather not feel</s> other parts of his face and head have their strange peculiarities</s>  hiscomplexion for instance has a singular sallowfairness so much atvariance with the darkbrown colour of his hair that i suspect thehair of being a wig and his face closely shaven all over is smootherand freer from all marks and wrinkles than mine though according tosir percivals account of him he is close on sixty years of age</s>  butthese are not the prominent personal characteristics which distinguishhim to my mind from all the other men i have ever seen</s>  the markedpeculiarity which singles him out from the rank and file of humanitylies entirely so far as i can tell at present in the extraordinaryexpression and extraordinary power of his eyes</s> his manner and his command of our language may also have assisted himin some degree to establish himself in my good opinion</s>  he has thatquiet deference that look of pleased attentive interest in listeningto a woman and that secret gentleness in his voice in speaking to awoman which say what we may we can none of us resist</s>  here toohis unusual command of the english language necessarily helps him</s>  ihad often heard of the extraordinary aptitude which many italians showin mastering our strong hard northern speech but until i saw countfosco i had never supposed it possible that any foreigner could havespoken english as he speaks it</s>  there are times when it is almostimpossible to detect by his accent that he is not a countryman of ourown and as for fluency there are very few born englishmen who cantalk with as few stoppages and repetitions as the count</s>  he mayconstruct his sentences more or less in the foreign way but i havenever yet heard him use a wrong expression or hesitate for a moment inhis choice of a word</s> all the smallest characteristics of this strange man have somethingstrikingly original and perplexingly contradictory in them</s>  fat as heis and old as he is his movements are astonishingly light and easy</s> he is as noiseless in a room as any of us women and more than thatwith all his look of unmistakable mental firmness and power he is asnervously sensitive as the weakest of us</s>  he starts at chance noisesas inveterately as laura herself</s>  he winced and shuddered yesterdaywhen sir percival beat one of the spaniels so that i felt ashamed ofmy own want of tenderness and sensibility by comparison with the count</s> the relation of this last incident reminds me of one of his mostcurious peculiarities which i have not yet mentionedhisextraordinary fondness for pet animals</s> some of these he has left on the continent but he has brought with himto this house a cockatoo two canarybirds and a whole family of whitemice</s>  he attends to all the necessities of these strange favouriteshimself and he has taught the creatures to be surprisingly fond of himand familiar with him</s>  the cockatoo a most vicious and treacherousbird towards every one else absolutely seems to love him</s>  when helets it out of its cage it hops on to

the canaries and they are perpetually letout like the canaries</s>  they crawl all over him popping in and out ofhis waistcoat and sitting in couples white as snow on his capaciousshoulders</s>  he seems to be even fonder of his mice than of his otherpets smiles at them and kisses them and calls them by all sorts ofendearing names</s>  if it be possible to suppose an englishman with anytaste for such childish interests and amusements as these thatenglishman would certainly feel rather ashamed of them and would beanxious to apologise for them in the company of grownup people</s>  butthe count apparently sees nothing ridiculous in the amazing contrastbetween his colossal self and his frail little pets</s>  he would blandlykiss his white mice and twitter to his canarybirds amid an assembly ofenglish foxhunters and would only pity them as barbarians when theywere all laughing their loudest at him</s> it seems hardly credible while i am writing it down but it iscertainly true that this same man who has all the fondness of an oldmaid for his cockatoo and all the small dexterities of an organboy inmanaging his white mice can talk when anything happens to rouse himwith a daring independence of thought a knowledge of books in everylanguage and an experience of society in half the capitals of europewhich would make him the prominent personage of any assembly in thecivilised

about to signmay be he continued i neither know nor desire to know</s>  i only saythis circumstances may happen in the future which may oblige percivalor his representatives to appeal to the two

words</s>  howlittle i once thought that we should ever want it at all</s> we must do what we can to help ourselves i said</s>  let us try totalk it over calmly lauralet us do all in our power to decide forthe best</s> putting what she knew of her husbands embarrassments and what i hadheard of his conversation with the lawyer together we arrivednecessarily at the conclusion that the parchment in the library hadbeen drawn up for the purpose of borrowing money and that laurassignature was absolutely necessary to fit it for the attainment of sirpercivals object</s> the second question concerning the nature of the legal contract bywhich the money was to be obtained and the degree of personalresponsibility to which laura might subject herself if she signed it inthe dark involved considerations which lay far beyond any knowledgeand experience that either of us possessed</s>  my own convictions led meto believe that the hidden contents of the parchment concealed atransaction of the meanest and the most fraudulent kind</s> i had not formed this conclusion in consequence of sir percivalsrefusal to show the writing or to explain it for that refusal mightwell have proceeded from his obstinate disposition and his domineeringtemper alone</s>  my sole motive for distrusting his honesty sprang fromthe change which i had observed in his language and his manners atblackwater park a change which convinced me that he had been acting apart throughout the whole period of his probation at limmeridge house</s> his elaborate delicacy his ceremonious politeness which harmonised soagreeably with mr</s>  gilmores oldfashioned notions his modesty withlaura his candour with me his moderation with mr</s>  fairlieall thesewere the artifices of a mean cunning and brutal man who had droppedhis disguise when his practised duplicity had gained its end and hadopenly shown himself in the library on that very day</s>  i say nothing ofthe grief which this discovery caused me on lauras account for it isnot to be expressed by any words of mine</s>  i only refer to it at allbecause it decided me to oppose her signing the parchment whatever theconsequences might be unless she was first made acquainted with thecontents</s> under these circumstances the one chance for us when tomorrow camewas to be provided with an objection to giving the signature whichmight rest on sufficiently firm commercial or legal grounds to shakesir percivals resolution and to make him suspect that we two womenunderstood the laws and obligations of business as well as himself</s> after some pondering i determined to write to the only honest manwithin reach whom we could trust to help us discreetly in our forlornsituation</s>  that man was mr</s>  gilmores partner mr</s>  kyrle whoconducted the business now that our old friend had been obliged towithdraw from it and to leave london on account of his health</s>  iexplained to laura that i had mr</s>  gilmores own authority for placingimplicit confidence in his partners integrity discretion andaccurate knowledge of all her affairs and with her full approval i satdown at once to write the letter i began by stating our position tomr</s>  kyrle exactly as it was and then asked for his advice in returnexpressed in plain downright terms which he could comprehend withoutany danger of misinterpretations and mistakes</s>  my letter was as shortas i could possibly make it and was i hope unencumbered by needlessapologies and needless details</s> just as i was about to put the address on the envelope an obstacle wasdiscovered by laura which in the effort and preoccupation of writinghad escaped my mind altogether</s> how are we to get the answer in time</s>  she asked</s>  your letter willnot be delivered in london before tomorrow morning and the post willnot bring the reply here till the morning after</s> the only way of overcoming this difficulty was to have the answerbrought to us from the lawyers office by a special messenger</s>  i wrotea postscript to that effect begging that the messenger might bedespatched with the reply by the eleven oclock morning train whichwould bring him to our station at twenty minutes past one and soenable him to reach blackwater park by two oclock at the latest</s>  hewas to be directed to ask for me to answer no questions addressed tohim by any one else and to deliver his letter into no hands but mine</s> in case sir percival should come back tomorrow before two oclock isaid to laura the wisest plan for you to adopt is to be out in thegrounds all the morning with your book or your work and not to appearat the house till the messenger has had time to arrive with the letter</s> i will wait here for him all the morning to guard against anymisadventures or mistakes</s>  by following this arrangement i hope andbelieve we shall avoid being taken by surprise</s>  let us go down to thedrawingroom now</s>  we may excite suspicion if we remain shut uptogether too long</s> suspicion</s>  she repeated</s>  whose suspicion can we excite now thatsir percival has left the house</s>  do you mean count fosco</s> perhaps i do laura</s> you are beginning to dislike him as much as i do marian</s> no not to dislike him</s>  dislike is always more or less associatedwith contempti can see nothing in the count to despise</s> you are not afraid of him are you</s> perhaps i ama little</s> afraid of him after his interference in our favour today</s> yes</s>  i am more afraid of his interference than i am of sir percivalsviolence</s>  remember what i said to you in the library</s>  whatever you dolaura dont make an enemy of the count</s> we went downstairs</s>  laura entered the drawingroom while i proceededacross the hall with my letter in my hand to put it into thepostbag which hung against the wall opposite to me</s> the house door was open and as i crossed past it i saw count foscoand his wife standing talking together on the steps outside with theirfaces turned towards me</s> the countess came into the hall rather hastily and asked if i hadleisure enough for five minutes private conversation</s>  feeling alittle surprised by such an appeal from such a person i put my letterinto the bag and replied that i was quite at her disposal</s>  she took myarm with unaccustomed friendliness and familiarity and instead ofleading me into an empty room drew me out with her to the belt of turfwhich surrounded the large fishpond</s> as we passed the count on the steps he bowed and smiled and then wentat once into the house pushing the hall door to after him but notactually closing it</s> the countess walked me gently round the fishpond</s>  i expected to bemade the depositary of some extraordinary confidence and i wasastonished to find that madame foscos communication for my private earwas nothing more than a polite assurance of her sympathy for me afterwhat had happened in the library</s>  her husband had told her of all thathad passed and of the insolent manner in which sir percival had spokento me</s>  this information had so shocked and distressed her on myaccount and on lauras that she had made up her mind if anything ofthe sort happened again to mark her sense of sir percivals outrageousconduct by leaving the house</s>  the count had approved of her idea andshe now hoped that i approved of it too</s> i thought this a very strange proceeding on the part of such aremarkably reserved woman as madame fosco especially after theinterchange of sharp speeches which had passed between us during theconversation in the boathouse on that very morning</s>  however it wasmy plain duty to meet a polite and friendly advance on the part of oneof my elders with a polite and friendly reply</s>  i answered the countessaccordingly in her own tone and then thinking we had said all thatwas necessary on either side made an attempt to get back to the house</s> but madame fosco seemed resolved not to part with me and to myunspeakable amazement resolved also to talk</s>  hitherto the most silentof women she now persecuted me with fluent conventionalities on thesubject of married life on the subject of sir percival and laura onthe subject of her own happiness on the subject of the late mr</s> fairlies conduct to her in the matter of her legacy and on half adozen other subjects besides until she had detained me walking roundand round the fishpond for more than half an hour and had quitewearied me out</s>  whether she discovered this or not i cannot say butshe stopped as abruptly as she had begunlooked towards the housedoor resumed her icy manner in a moment and dropped my arm of her ownaccord before i could think of an excuse for accomplishing my ownrelease from her</s> as i pushed open the door and entered the hall i found myself suddenlyface to face with the count again</s>  he was just putting a letter intothe postbag</s> after he had dropped it in and had closed the bag he asked me where ihad left madame fosco</s>  i told him and he went out at the hall doorimmediately to join his wife</s>  his manner when he spoke to me was sounusually quiet and subdued that i turned and looked after himwondering if he were ill or out of spirits</s> why my next proceeding was to go straight up to the postbag and takeout my own letter and look at it again with a vague distrust on meand why the looking at it for the second time instantly suggested theidea to my mind of sealing the envelope for its greater securityaremysteries which are either too deep or too shallow for me to fathom</s> women as everybody knows constantly act on impulses which they cannotexplain even to themselves and i can only suppose that one of thoseimpulses was the hidden cause of my unaccountable conduct on thisoccasion</s> whatever influence animated me i found cause to congratulate myself onhaving obeyed it as soon as i prepared to seal the letter in my ownroom</s>  i had originally closed the envelope in the usual way bymoistening the adhesive point and pressing it on the paper beneath andwhen i now tried it with my finger after a lapse of fullthreequarters of an hour the envelope opened on the instant withoutsticking or tearing</s>  perhaps i had fastened it insufficiently</s>  perhapsthere might have been some defect in the adhesive gum</s> or perhapsno</s>  it is quite revolting enough to feel that thirdconjecture stirring in my mind</s>  i would rather not see it confrontingme in plain black and white</s> i almost dread tomorrowso much depends on my discretion andselfcontrol</s>  there are two precautions at

i trust nothing laura but my own observation of your husbandsconduct</s>  i judge anne cathericks words by his actions and i believethere is a secret</s> i said no more and got up to leave the room</s>  thoughts were troublingme which i might have told her if we had spoken together longer andwhich it might have been dangerous for her to know</s>  the influence ofthe terrible dream from which she had awakened me hung darkly andheavily over every fresh impression which the progress of her narrativeproduced on my mind</s>  i felt the ominous future coming close chillingme with an unutterable awe forcing on me the conviction of an unseendesign in the long series of complications which had now fastened roundus</s>  i thought of hartrightas i saw him in the body when he saidfarewell as i saw him in the spirit in my dreamand i too began todoubt now whether we were not advancing blindfold to an appointed andan inevitable end</s> leaving laura to go upstairs alone i went out to look about me in thewalks near the house</s>  the circumstances under which anne catherick hadparted from her had made me secretly anxious to know how count foscowas passing the afternoon and had rendered me secretly distrustful ofthe results of that solitary journey from which sir percival hadreturned but a few hours since</s> after looking for them in every direction and discovering nothing ireturned to the house and entered the different rooms on the groundfloor one after another</s>  they were all empty</s>  i came out again intothe hall and went upstairs to return to laura</s>  madame fosco openedher door as i passed it in my way along the passage and i stopped tosee if she could inform me of the whereabouts of her husband and sirpercival</s>  yes she had seen them both from her window more than anhour since</s>  the count had looked up with his customary kindness andhad mentioned with his habitual attention to her in the smallesttrifles that he and his friend were going out together for a long walk</s> for a long walk</s>  they had never yet been in each others company withthat object in my experience of them</s>  sir percival cared for noexercise but riding and the count except when he was polite enough tobe my escort cared for no exercise at all</s> when i joined laura again i found that she had called to mind in myabsence the impending question of the signature to the deed which inthe interest of discussing her interview with anne catherick we hadhitherto overlooked</s>  her first words when i saw her expressed hersurprise at the absence of the expected summons to attend sir percivalin the library</s> you may make your mind easy on that subject i said</s>  for thepresent at least neither your resolution nor mine will be exposed toany further trial</s>  sir percival has altered his plansthe businessof the signature is put off</s> put off</s>  laura repeated amazedly</s>  who told you so</s> my authority is count fosco</s>  i believe it is to his interference thatwe are indebted for your husbands sudden change of purpose</s> it seems impossible marian</s>  if the object of my signing was as wesuppose to obtain money for sir percival that he urgently wanted howcan the matter be put off</s> i think laura we have the means at hand of setting that doubt atrest</s>  have you forgotten the conversation that i heard between sirpercival and the lawyer as they were crossing the hall</s> no but i dont rememberi do</s>  there were two alternatives proposed</s>  one was to obtain yoursignature to the parchment</s>  the other was to gain time by giving billsat three months</s>  the last resource is evidently the resource nowadopted and we may fairly hope to be relieved from our share in sirpercivals embarrassments for some time to come</s> oh marian it sounds too good to be true</s> does it my love</s>  you complimented me on my ready memory not longsince but you seem to doubt it now</s>  i will get my journal and youshall see if i am right or wrong</s> i went away and got the book at once</s> on looking back to the entry referring to the lawyers visit we foundthat my recollection of the two alternatives presented was accuratelycorrect</s>  it was almost as great a relief to my mind as to lauras tofind that my memory had served me on this occasion as faithfully asusual</s>  in the perilous uncertainty of our present situation it ishard to say what future interests may not depend upon the regularity ofthe entries in my journal and upon the reliability of my recollectionat the time when i make them</s> lauras face and manner suggested to me that this last considerationhad occurred to her as well as to myself</s>  anyway it is only atrifling matter and i am almost ashamed to put it down here inwritingit seems to set the forlornness of our situation in such amiserably vivid light</s>  we must have little indeed to depend on whenthe discovery that my memory can still be trusted to serve us is hailedas if it was the discovery of a new friend</s> the first bell for dinner separated us</s>  just as it had done ringingsir percival and the count returned from their walk</s>  we heard themaster of the house storming at the servants for being five minuteslate and the masters guest interposing as usual in the interests ofpropriety patience and peace</s>          the evening has come and gone</s>  no extraordinary event has happened</s> but i have noticed certain peculiarities in the conduct of sir percivaland the count which have sent me to my bed feeling very anxious anduneasy about anne catherick and about the results which tomorrow mayproduce</s> i know enough by this time to be sure that the aspect of sir percivalwhich is the most false and which therefore means the worst is hispolite aspect</s>  that long walk with his friend had ended in improvinghis manners especially towards his wife</s>  to lauras secret surpriseand to my secret alarm he called her by her christian name asked ifshe had heard lately from her uncle inquired when mrs</s>  vesey was toreceive her invitation to blackwater and showed her so many otherlittle attentions that he almost recalled the days of his hatefulcourtship at limmeridge house</s>  this was a bad sign to begin with andi thought it more ominous still that he should pretend after dinner tofall asleep in the drawingroom and that his eyes should cunninglyfollow laura and me when he thought we neither of us suspected him</s>  ihave never had any doubt that his sudden journey by himself took him towelmingham to question mrs</s>  catherickbut the experience of tonighthas made me fear that the expedition was not undertaken in vain andthat he has got the information which he unquestionably left us tocollect</s>  if i knew where anne catherick was to be found i would be uptomorrow with sunrise and warn her</s> while the aspect under which sir percival presented himself tonightwas unhappily but too familiar to me the aspect under which the countappeared was on the other hand entirely new in my experience of him</s> he permitted me this evening to make his acquaintance for the firsttime in the character of a man of sentimentof sentiment as ibelieve really felt not assumed for the occasion</s> for instance he was quiet and subduedhis eyes and his voiceexpressed a restrained sensibility</s>  he wore as if there was somehidden connection between his showiest finery and his deepest feelingthe most magnificent waistcoat he has yet appeared init was made ofpale seagreen silk and delicately trimmed with fine silver braid</s> his voice sank into the tenderest inflections his smile expressed athoughtful fatherly admiration whenever he spoke to laura or to me</s> he pressed his wifes hand under the table when she thanked him fortrifling little attentions at dinner</s>  he took wine with her</s>  yourhealth and happiness my angel</s>  he said with fond glistening eyes</s> he ate little or nothing and sighed and said good percival</s>  whenhis friend laughed at him</s>  after dinner he took laura by the handand asked her if she would be so sweet as to play to him</s>  shecomplied through sheer astonishment</s>  he sat by the piano with hiswatchchain resting in folds like a golden serpent on the seagreenprotuberance of his waistcoat</s>  his immense head lay languidly on oneside and he gently beat time with two of his yellowwhite fingers</s>  hehighly approved of the music and tenderly admired lauras manner ofplayingnot as poor hartright used to praise it with an innocentenjoyment of the sweet sounds but with a clear cultivated practicalknowledge of the merits of the composition in the first place and ofthe merits of the players touch in the second</s>  as the evening closedin he begged that the lovely dying light might not be profaned justyet by the appearance of the lamps</s>  he came with his horribly silenttread to the distant window at which i was standing to be out of hisway and to avoid the very sight of himhe came to ask me to supporthis protest against the lamps</s>  if any one of them could only haveburnt him up at that moment i would have gone down to the kitchen andfetched it myself</s> surely you like this modest trembling english twilight</s>  he saidsoftly</s>  ah</s>  i love it</s>  i feel my inborn admiration of all that isnoble and great and good purified by the breath of heaven on anevening like this</s>  nature has such imperishable charms suchinextinguishable tenderness for me</s> i am an old fat mantalk whichwould become your lips miss halcombe sounds like a derision and amockery on mine</s>  it is hard to be laughed at in my moments ofsentiment as if my soul was like myself old and overgrown</s>  observedear lady what a light is dying on the trees</s>  does it penetrate yourheart as it penetrates mine</s> he paused looked at me and repeated the famous lines of dante on theeveningtime with a melody and tenderness which added a charm of theirown to the matchless beauty of the poetry itself</s> bah</s>  he cried suddenly as the last cadence of those noble italianwords died away on his lips i make an old fool of myself and onlyweary you all</s>  let us shut up the window in our bosoms and get back tothe matteroffact world</s>  percival</s>  i sanction the admission of thelamps</s>  lady glydemiss halcombeeleanor my good wifewhich of youwill indulge me with a game at dominoes</s> he addressed us all but he looked especially at laura</s> she had learnt to feel my dread of offending him and she accepted hisproposal</s>  it was more than i could have done at that moment</s>  i couldnot have sat down at the same table with him for any consideration</s> his eyes seemed to reach my inmost soul through the thickeningobscurity of the twilight</s>  his voice trembled along every nerve in mybody and turned me hot and cold alternately</s>  the mystery and terrorof my dream which had haunted me at intervals all through the eveningnow oppressed my mind with an unendurable foreboding and an unutterableawe</s>  i saw the white tomb again and the veiled woman rising out of itby hartrights side</s>  the thought of laura welled up like a spring inthe depths of my heart and filled it with waters of bitterness nevernever known to it before</s>  i caught her by the hand as she passed me onher way to the table and kissed her as if that night was to part usfor ever</s>  while they were all gazing at me in astonishment i ran outthrough the low window which was open before me to the groundran outto hide from them in the darkness to hide even from myself</s> we separated that evening later than usual</s>  towards midnight thesummer silence was broken by the shuddering of a low melancholy windamong the trees</s>  we all felt the sudden chill in the atmosphere butthe count was the first to notice the stealthy rising of the wind</s>  hestopped while he was lighting my candle for me and held up his handwarninglylisten</s>  he said</s>  there will be a change tomorrow</s> viijune 19th</s> the events of yesterday warned me to be ready sooner orlater to meet the worst</s>  today is not yet at an end and the worsthas come</s> judging by the closest calculation of time that laura and i could makewe arrived at the conclusion that anne catherick must have appeared atthe boathouse at halfpast two oclock on the afternoon of yesterday</s> i accordingly arranged that laura should just show herself at theluncheontable today and should then slip out at the firstopportunity leaving me behind to preserve appearances and to followher as soon as i could safely do so</s>  this mode of proceeding if noobstacles occurred to thwart us would enable her to be at theboathouse before halfpast two and when i left the table in myturn would take me to a safe position in the plantation before three</s> the change in the weather which last nights wind warned us to expectcame with the morning</s>  it was raining heavily when i got up and itcontinued to rain until twelve oclockwhen the clouds dispersed theblue sky appeared and the sun shone again with the bright promise of afine afternoon</s> my anxiety to know how sir percival and the count would occupy theearly part of the day was by no means set at rest so far as sirpercival was concerned by his leaving us immediately after breakfastand going out by himself in spite of the rain</s>  he neither told uswhere he was going nor when we might expect him back</s>  we saw him passthe breakfastroom window hastily with his high boots and hiswaterproof coat onand that was all</s> the count passed the morning quietly indoors some part of it in thelibrary some part in the drawingroom playing odds and ends of musicon the piano and humming to himself</s>  judging by appearances thesentimental side of his character was persistently inclined to betrayitself still</s>  he was silent and sensitive and ready to sigh andlanguish ponderously as only fat men can sigh and languish on thesmallest provocation</s> luncheontime came and sir percival did not return</s>  the count took hisfriends place at the table plaintively devoured the greater part of afruit tart submerged under a whole jugful of cream and explained thefull merit of the achievement to us as soon as he had done</s>  a tastefor sweets he said in his softest tones and his tenderest manner isthe innocent taste of women and children</s>  i love to share it withthemit is another bond dear ladies between you and me</s> laura left the table in ten minutes time</s>  i was sorely tempted toaccompany her</s>  but if we had both gone out together we must haveexcited suspicion and worse still if we allowed anne catherick to seelaura accompanied by a second person who was a stranger to her weshould in all probability forfeit her confidence from that momentnever to regain it again</s> i waited therefore as patiently as i could until the servant came into clear the table</s>  when i quitted the room there were no signs inthe house or out of it of sir percivals return</s>  i left the countwith a piece of sugar between his lips and the vicious cockatooscrambling up his waistcoat to get at it while madame fosco sittingopposite to her husband watched the proceedings of his bird andhimself as attentively as if she had never seen anything of the sortbefore in her life</s>  on my way to the plantation i kept carefullybeyond the range of view from the luncheonroom window</s>  nobody saw meand nobody followed me</s>  it was then a quarter to three oclock by mywatch</s> once among the trees i walked rapidly until i had advanced more thanhalfway through the plantation</s>  at that point i slackened my pace andproceeded cautiously but i saw no one and heard no voices</s>  by littleand little i came within view of the back of the boathousestoppedand listenedthen went on till i was close behind it and must haveheard any persons who were talking inside</s>  still the silence wasunbrokenstill far and near no sign of a living creature appearedanywhere</s> after skirting round by the back of the building first on one side andthen on the other and making no discoveries i ventured in front ofit and fairly looked in</s>  the place was empty</s> i called laura</s> at first softly then louder and louder</s>  no oneanswered and no one appeared</s>  for all that i could see and hear theonly human creature in the neighbourhood of the lake and the plantationwas myself</s> my heart began to beat violently but i kept my resolution andsearched first the boathouse and then the ground in front of it forany signs which might show me whether laura had really reached theplace or not</s>  no mark of her presence appeared inside the buildingbut i found traces of her outside it in footsteps on the sand</s> i detected the footsteps of two personslarge footsteps like a mansand small footsteps which by putting my own feet into them andtesting their size in that manner i felt certain were lauras</s>  theground was confusedly marked in this way just before the boathouse</s> close against one side of it under shelter of the projecting roof idiscovered a little hole in the sanda hole artificially made beyonda doubt</s>  i just noticed it and then turned away immediately to tracethe footsteps as far as i could and to follow the direction in whichthey might lead me</s> they led me starting from the lefthand side of the boathouse alongthe edge of the trees a distance i should think of between two andthree hundred yards and then the sandy ground showed no further traceof them</s>  feeling that the persons whose course i was tracking mustnecessarily have entered the plantation at this point i entered ittoo</s>  at first i could find no path but i discovered one afterwardsjust faintly traced among the trees and followed it</s>  it took me forsome distance in the direction of the village until i stopped at apoint where another foottrack crossed it</s>  the brambles grew thicklyon either side of this second path</s>  i stood looking down it uncertainwhich way to take next and while i looked i saw on one thorny branchsome fragments of fringe from a womans shawl</s>  a closer examination ofthe fringe satisfied me that it had been torn from a shawl of laurasand i instantly followed the second path</s>  it brought me out at lastto my great relief at the back of the house</s>  i say to my greatrelief because i inferred that laura must for some unknown reasonhave returned before me by this roundabout way</s>  i went in by thecourtyard and the offices</s>  the first person whom i met in crossingthe servants hall was mrs</s>  michelson the housekeeper</s> do you know i asked whether lady glyde has come in from her walkor not</s> my lady came in a little while ago with sir percival answered thehousekeeper</s>  i am afraid miss halcombe something very distressinghas happened</s> my heart sank within me</s>  you dont mean an accident</s>  i said faintly</s> no nothank god no accident</s>  but my lady ran upstairs to her ownroom in tears and sir percival has ordered me to give fanny warning toleave in an hours time</s> fanny was lauras maida good affectionate girl who had been with herfor yearsthe only person in the house whose fidelity and devotion wecould both depend upon</s> where is fanny</s>  i inquired</s> in my room miss halcombe</s>  the young woman is quite overcome and itold her to sit down and try to recover herself</s> i went to mrs</s>  michelsons room and found fanny in a corner with herbox by her side crying bitterly</s> she could give me no explanation whatever of her sudden dismissal</s>  sirpercival had ordered that she should have a months wages in place ofa months warning and go</s>  no reason had been assignedno objectionhad been made to her conduct</s>  she had been forbidden to appeal to hermistress forbidden even to see her for a moment to say goodbye</s>  shewas to go without explanations or farewells and to go at once</s> after soothing the poor girl by a few friendly words i asked where sheproposed to sleep that night</s>  she replied that she thought of going tothe little inn in the village the landlady of which was a respectablewoman known to the servants at blackwater park</s>  the next morning byleaving early she might get back to her friends in cumberland withoutstopping in london where she was a total stranger</s> i felt directly that fannys departure offered us a safe means ofcommunication with london and with limmeridge house of which it mightbe very important to avail ourselves</s>  accordingly i told her that shemight expect to hear from her mistress or from me in the course of theevening and that she might depend on our both doing all that lay inour power to help her under the trial of leaving us for the present</s> those words said i shook hands with her and went upstairs</s> the door which led to lauras room was the door of an antechamberopening on to the passage</s>  when i tried it it was bolted on theinside</s> i knocked and the door was opened by the same heavy overgrownhousemaid whose lumpish insensibility had tried my patience so severelyon the day when i found the wounded dog</s> i had since that time discovered that her name was margaret porcherand that she was the most awkward slatternly and obstinate servant inthe house</s> on opening the door she instantly stepped out to the threshold andstood grinning at me in stolid silence</s> why do you stand there</s>  i said</s>  dont you see that i want to comein</s> ah but you mustnt come in was the answer with another and abroader grin still</s> how dare you talk to me in that way</s>  stand back instantly</s> she stretched out a great red hand and arm on each side of her so asto bar the doorway and slowly nodded her addle head at me</s> masters orders she said and nodded again</s> i had need of all my selfcontrol to warn me against contesting thematter with her and to remind me that the next words i had to say mustbe addressed to her master</s>  i turned my back on her and instantlywent downstairs to find him</s>  my resolution to keep my temper under allthe irritations that sir percival could offer was by this time ascompletely forgotteni say so to my shameas if i had never made it</s> it did me good after all i had suffered and suppressed in thathouseit actually did me good to feel how angry i was</s> the drawingroom and the breakfastroom were both empty</s>  i went on tothe library and there i found sir percival the count and madamefosco</s>  they were all three standing up close together and sirpercival had a little slip of paper in his hand</s>  as i opened the doori heard the count say to him noa thousand times over no</s> i walked straight up to him and looked him full in the face</s> am i to understand sir percival that your wifes room is a

and the count gaveme his arm</s>  he was hot and flushed and was not dressed with hiscustomary care and completeness</s>  had he too been out before dinnerand been late in getting back</s>  or was he only suffering from the heat alittle more severely than usual</s> however this might be he was unquestionably troubled by some secretannoyance or anxiety which with all his powers of deception he wasnot able entirely to conceal</s>  through the whole of dinner he wasalmost as silent as sir percival himself and he every now and thenlooked at his wife with an expression of furtive uneasiness which wasquite new in my experience of him</s>  the one social obligation which heseemed to be selfpossessed enough to perform as carefully as ever wasthe obligation of being persistently civil and attentive to me</s>  whatvile object he has in view i cannot still discover but be the designwhat it may invariable politeness towards myself invariable humilitytowards laura and invariable suppression at any cost of sirpercivals clumsy violence have been the means he has resolutely andimpenetrably used to get to his end ever since he set foot in thishouse</s>  i suspected it when he first interfered in our favour on theday when the deed was produced in the library and i feel certain of itnow</s> when madame fosco and i rose to leave the table the count rose also toaccompany us

evening</s> civil</s>  said sir percival savagely</s>  civil behaviour upon my soulto a man in his own house</s> i had more than once seen him look at the count uneasily duringdinnertime and had observed that the count carefully abstained fromlooking at him in return</s>  this circumstance coupled with the hostsanxiety for a little quiet talk over the wine and the guestsobstinate resolution not to sit down again at the table revived in mymemory the request which sir percival had vainly addressed to hisfriend earlier in the day to come out of the library and speak to him</s> the count had deferred granting that private interview when it wasfirst asked for in the afternoon and had again deferred granting itwhen it was a second time asked for at the dinnertable</s>  whatever thecoming subject of discussion between them might be it was clearly animportant subject in sir percivals estimationand perhaps judgingfrom his evident reluctance to approach it a dangerous subject aswell in the estimation of the count</s> these considerations occurred to me while we were passing from thediningroom to the drawingroom</s>  sir percivals angry commentary onhis friends desertion of him had not produced the slightest effect</s> the count obstinately accompanied us to the teatablewaited a minuteor two in the roomwent out into the halland returned with thepostbag in his hands</s>  it was then eight oclockthe hour at whichthe letters were always despatched from blackwater park</s> have you any letter for the post miss halcombe</s>  he askedapproaching me with the bag</s> i saw madame fosco who was making the tea pause with the sugartongsin her hand to listen for my answer</s> no count thank you</s>  no letters today</s> he gave the bag to the servant who was then in the room sat down atthe piano and played the air of the lively neapolitan streetsongla mia carolina twice over</s>  his wife who was usually the mostdeliberate of women in all her movements made the tea as quickly as icould have made it myselffinished her own cup in two minutes andquietly glided out of the room</s> i rose to follow her examplepartly because i suspected her ofattempting some treachery upstairs with laura partly because i wasresolved not to remain alone in the same room with her husband</s> before i could get to the door the count stopped me by a request for acup of tea</s>  i gave him the cup of tea and tried a second time to getaway</s>  he stopped me againthis time by going back to the piano andsuddenly appealing to me on a musical question in which he declaredthat the honour of his country was concerned</s> i vainly pleaded my own total ignorance of music and total want oftaste in that direction</s>  he only appealed to me again with a vehemencewhich set all further protest on my part at defiance</s>  the english andthe germans he indignantly declared were always reviling the italiansfor their inability to cultivate the higher kinds of music</s>  we wereperpetually talking of our oratorios and they were perpetually talkingof their symphonies</s>  did we forget and did they forget his immortalfriend and countryman rossini</s>  what was moses in egypt but a sublimeoratorio which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung ina concertroom</s>  what was the overture to guillaume tell but a symphonyunder another name</s>  had i heard moses in egypt</s>  would i listen to thisand this and this and say if anything more sublimely sacred and grandhad ever been composed by mortal man</s> and without waiting for a wordof assent or dissent on my part looking me hard in the face all thetime he began thundering on the piano and singing to it with loud andlofty enthusiasmonly interrupting himself at intervals to announceto me fiercely the titles of the different pieces of music chorus ofegyptians in the plague of darkness miss halcombe</s> recitativo ofmoses with the tables of the law</s> prayer of israelites at thepassage of the red sea</s>  aha</s>  aha</s>  is that sacred</s>  is that sublime</s> the piano trembled under his powerful hands and the teacups on thetable rattled as his big bass voice thundered out the notes and hisheavy foot beat time on the floor</s> there was something horriblesomething fierce and devilishin theoutburst of his delight at his own singing and playing and in thetriumph with which he watched its effect upon me as i shrank nearer andnearer to the door</s>  i was released at last not by my own efforts butby sir percivals interposition</s>  he opened the diningroom door andcalled out angrily to know what that infernal noise meant</s>  the countinstantly got up from the piano</s>  ah</s>  if percival is coming he saidharmony and melody are both at an end</s>  the muse of music misshalcombe deserts us in dismay and i the fat old minstrel exhale therest of my enthusiasm in the open air</s>  he stalked out into theverandah put his hands in his pockets and resumed the recitativo ofmoses sotto voce in the garden</s> i heard sir percival call after him from the diningroom window</s>  but hetook no noticehe seemed determined not to hear</s>  that longdeferredquiet talk between them was still to be put off was still to wait forthe counts absolute will and pleasure</s> he had detained me in the drawingroom nearly half an hour from thetime when his wife left us</s>  where had she been and what had she beendoing in that interval</s> i went upstairs to ascertain but i made no discoveries and when iquestioned laura i found that she had not heard anything</s>  nobody haddisturbed her no faint rustling of the silk dress had been audibleeither in the anteroom or in the passage</s> it was then twenty minutes to nine</s>  after going to my room to get myjournal i returned and sat with laura sometimes writing sometimesstopping to talk with her</s>  nobody came near us and nothing happened</s> we remained together till ten oclock</s>  i then rose said my lastcheering words and wished her goodnight</s>  she locked her door againafter we had arranged that i should come in and see her the first thingin the morning</s> i had a few sentences more to add to my diary before going to bedmyself and as i went down again to the drawingroom after leavinglaura for the last time that weary day i resolved merely to showmyself there to make my excuses and then to retire an hour earlierthan usual for the night</s> sir percival and the count and his wife were sitting together</s>  sirpercival was yawning in an easychair the count was reading madamefosco was fanning herself</s>  strange to say her face was flushed now</s> she who never suffered from the heat was most undoubtedly sufferingfrom it tonight</s> i am afraid countess you are not quite so well as usual</s>  i said</s> the very remark i was about to make to you she replied</s>  you arelooking pale my dear</s> my dear</s>  it was the first time she had ever addressed me with thatfamiliarity</s>  there was an insolent smile too on her face when she saidthe words</s> i am suffering from one of my bad headaches i answered coldly</s> ah indeed</s>  want of exercise i suppose</s>  a walk before dinner

the example of retiring i said</s> the only remedy for such a headache as mine is going to bed</s> i took my leave</s>  there was the same insolent smile on the womans facewhen i shook hands with her</s>  sir percival paid no attention to me</s>  hewas looking impatiently at madame fosco who showed no signs of leavingthe room with me</s>  the count smiled to himself behind his book</s>  therewas yet another delay to that quiet talk with sir percivaland thecountess was the impediment this time</s> ixjune 19th</s> once safely shut into my own room i opened these pagesand prepared to go on with that part of the days record which wasstill left to write</s> for ten minutes or more i sat idle with the pen in my hand thinkingover the events of the last twelve hours</s>  when i at last addressedmyself to my task i found a difficulty in proceeding with it which ihad never experienced before</s>  in spite of my efforts to fix mythoughts on the matter in hand they wandered away with the strangestpersistency in the one direction of sir percival and the count and allthe interest which i tried to concentrate on my journal centred insteadin that private interview between them which had been put off allthrough the day and which was now to take place in the silence andsolitude of the night</s> in this perverse state of my mind the recollection of what had passedsince the morning would not come back to me and there was no resourcebut to close my journal and to get away from it for a little while</s> i opened the door which led from my bedroom into my sittingroom andhaving passed through pulled it to again to prevent any accident incase of draught with the candle left on the dressingtable</s>  mysittingroom window was wide open and i leaned out listlessly to lookat the night</s> it was dark and quiet</s>  neither moon nor stars were visible</s>  there wasa smell like rain in the still heavy air and i put my hand out ofwindow</s>  no</s>  the rain was only threatening it had not come yet</s> i remained leaning on the windowsill for nearly a quarter of an hourlooking out absently into the black darkness and hearing nothingexcept now and then the voices of the servants or the distant sound ofa closing door in the lower part of the house</s> just as i was turning away wearily from the window to go back to thebedroom and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry inmy journal i smelt the odour of tobaccosmoke stealing towards me onthe heavy night air</s>  the next moment i saw a tiny red spark advancingfrom the farther end of the house in the pitch darkness</s>  i heard nofootsteps and i could see nothing but the spark</s>  it travelled alongin the night passed the window at which i was standing and stoppedopposite my bedroom window inside which i had left the light burningon the dressingtable</s> the spark remained stationary for a moment then moved back again inthe direction from which it had advanced</s>  as i followed its progress isaw a second red spark larger than the first approaching from thedistance</s>  the two met together in the darkness</s>  remembering whosmoked cigarettes and who smoked cigars i inferred immediately thatthe count had come out first to look and listen under my window andthat sir percival had afterwards joined him</s>  they must both have beenwalking on the lawnor i should certainly have heard sir percivalsheavy footfall though the counts soft step might have escaped meeven on the gravel walk</s> i waited quietly at the window certain that they could neither of themsee me in the darkness of the room</s> whats the matter</s>  i heard sir percival say in a low voice</s>  whydont you come in and sit down</s> i want to see the light out of that window replied the count softly</s> what harm does the light do</s> it shows she is not in bed yet</s>  she is sharp enough to suspectsomething and bold enough to come downstairs and listen if she canget the chance</s>  patience percivalpatience</s> humbug</s>  youre always talking of patience</s> i shall talk of something else presently</s>  my good friend you are onthe edge of your domestic precipice and if i let you give the womenone other chance on my sacred word of honour they will push you overit</s> what the devil do you mean</s> we will come to our explanations percival when the light is out ofthat window and when i have had one little look at the rooms on eachside of the library and a peep at the staircase as well</s> they slowly moved away and the rest of the conversation between themwhich had been conducted throughout in the same low tones ceased tobe audible</s>  it was no matter</s>  i had heard enough to determine me onjustifying the counts opinion of my sharpness and my courage</s>  beforethe red sparks were out of sight in the darkness i had made up my mindthat there should be a listener when those two men sat down to theirtalkand that the listener in spite of all the counts precautions tothe contrary should be myself</s>  i wanted but one motive to sanctionthe act to my own conscience and to give me courage enough forperforming itand that motive i had</s>  lauras honour laurashappinesslauras life itselfmight depend on my quick ears and myfaithful memory tonight</s> i had heard the count say that he meant to examine the rooms on eachside of the library and the staircase as well before he entered onany explanation with sir percival</s>  this expression of his intentionswas necessarily sufficient to inform me that the library was the roomin which he proposed that the conversation should take place</s>  the onemoment of time which was long enough to bring me to that conclusion wasalso the moment which showed me a means of baffling hisprecautionsor in other words of hearing what he and sir percivalsaid to each other without the risk of descending at all into thelower regions of the house</s> in speaking of the rooms on the ground floor i have mentionedincidentally the verandah outside them on which they all opened bymeans of french windows extending from the cornice to the floor</s>  thetop of this verandah was flat the rainwater being carried off from itby pipes into tanks which helped to supply the house</s>  on the narrowleaden roof which ran along past the bedrooms and which was ratherless i should think than three feet below the sills of the window arow of flowerpots was ranged with wide intervals between eachpotthe whole being protected from falling in high winds by anornamental iron railing along the edge of the roof</s> the plan which had now occurred to me was to get out at my sittingroomwindow on to this roof to creep along noiselessly till i reached thatpart of it which was immediately over the library window and to crouchdown between the flowerpots with my ear against the outer railing</s> if sir percival and the count sat and smoked tonight as i had seenthem sitting and smoking many nights before with their chairs close atthe open window and their feet stretched on the zinc garden seatswhich were placed under the verandah every word they said to eachother above a whisper and no long conversation as we all know byexperience can be carried on in a whisper must inevitably reach myears</s>  if on the other hand they chose tonight to sit far backinside the room then the chances were that i should hear little ornothingand in that case i must run the far more serious risk oftrying to outwit them downstairs</s> strongly as i was fortified in my resolution by the desperate nature ofour situation i hoped most fervently that i might escape this lastemergency</s>  my courage was only a womans courage after all and it wasvery near to failing me when i thought of trusting myself on the groundfloor at the dead of night within reach of sir percival and the count</s> i went softly back to my bedroom to try the safer experiment of theverandah roof first</s> a complete change in my dress was imperatively necessary for manyreasons</s>  i took off my silk gown to begin with because the slightestnoise from it on that still night might have betrayed me</s>  i nextremoved the white and cumbersome parts of my underclothing andreplaced them by a petticoat of dark flannel</s>  over this i put my blacktravelling cloak and pulled the hood on to my head</s>  in my ordinaryevening costume i took up the room of three men at least</s>  in mypresent dress when it was held close about me no man could havepassed through the narrowest spaces more easily than i</s>  the littlebreadth left on the roof of the verandah between the flowerpots onone side and the wall and the windows of the house on the other madethis a serious consideration</s>  if i knocked anything down if i madethe least noise who could say what the consequences might be</s> i only waited to put the matches near the candle before i extinguishedit and groped my way back into the sittingroom i locked that dooras i had locked my bedroom doorthen quietly got out of the windowand cautiously set my feet on the leaden roof of the verandah</s> my two rooms were at the inner extremity of the new wing of the housein which we all lived and i had five windows to pass before i couldreach the position it was necessary to take up immediately over thelibrary</s>  the first window belonged to a spare room which was empty</s> the second and third windows belonged to lauras room</s>  the fourthwindow belonged to sir percivals room</s>  the fifth belonged to thecountesss room</s>  the others by which it was not necessary for me topass were the windows of the counts dressingroom of the bathroomand of the second empty spare room</s> no sound reached my earsthe black blinding darkness of the night wasall round me when i first stood on the verandah except at that part ofit which madame foscos window overlooked</s>  there at the very placeabove the library to which my course was directedthere i saw a gleamof light</s>  the countess was not yet in bed</s> it was too late to draw backit was no time to wait</s>  i determined togo on at all hazards and trust for security to my own caution and tothe darkness of the night</s>  for lauras sake</s>  i thought to myself asi took the first step forward on the roof with one hand holding mycloak close round me and the other groping against the wall of thehouse</s>  it was better to brush close by the wall than to risk strikingmy feet against the flowerpots within a few inches of me on the otherside</s> i passed the dark window of the spare room trying the leaden roof ateach step with my foot before i risked resting my weight on it</s>  ipassed the dark windows of lauras room god bless her and keep hertonight</s> </s>  i passed the dark window of sir percivals room</s>  then iwaited a moment knelt down with my hands to support me and so creptto my position under the protection of the low wall between the bottomof the lighted window and the verandah roof</s> when i ventured to look up at the window itself i found that the top ofit only was open and that the blind inside was drawn down</s>  while i waslooking i saw the shadow of madame fosco pass across the white field ofthe blindthen pass slowly back again</s>  thus far she could not haveheard me or the shadow would surely have stopped at the blind even ifshe had wanted courage enough to open the window and look out</s> i placed myself sideways against the railing of the verandahfirstascertaining by touching them the position of the flowerpots oneither side of me</s>  there was room enough for me to sit between themand no more</s>  the sweetscented leaves of the flower on my left handjust brushed my cheek as i lightly rested my head against the railing</s> the first sounds that reached me from below were caused by the openingor closing most probably the latter of three doors in successionthedoors no doubt leading into the hall and into the rooms on each sideof the library which the count had pledged himself to examine</s>  thefirst object that i saw was the red spark again travelling out into thenight from under the verandah moving away towards my window waiting amoment and then returning to the place from which it had set out</s> the devil take your restlessness</s>  when do you mean to sit down</s> growled sir percivals voice beneath me</s> ouf</s>  how hot it is</s>  said the count sighing and puffing wearily</s> his exclamation was followed by the scraping of the garden chairs onthe tiled pavement under the verandahthe welcome sound which told methey were going to sit close at the window as usual</s>  so far the chancewas mine</s>  the clock in the turret struck the quarter to twelve as theysettled themselves in their chairs</s>  i heard madame fosco through theopen window yawning and saw her shadow pass once more across the whitefield of the blind</s> meanwhile sir percival and the count began talking together below nowand then dropping their voices a little lower than usual but neversinking them to a whisper</s>
 the strangeness and peril of my situationthe dread which i could not master of madame foscos lighted windowmade it difficult almost impossible for me at first to keep mypresence of mind and to fix my attention solely on the conversationbeneath</s>  for some minutes i could only succeed in gathering thegeneral substance of it</s>  i understood the count to say that the onewindow alight was his wifes that the ground floor of the house wasquite clear and that they might now speak to each other without fearof accidents</s>  sir percival merely answered by upbraiding his friendwith having unjustifiably slighted his wishes and neglected hisinterests all through the day</s>  the count thereupon defended himself bydeclaring that he had been beset by certain troubles and anxietieswhich had absorbed all his attention and that the only safe time tocome to an explanation was a time when they could feel certain of beingneither interrupted nor overheard</s>  we are at a serious crisis in ouraffairs percival he said and if we are to decide on the future atall we must decide secretly tonight</s> that sentence of the counts was the first which my attention was readyenough to master exactly as it was spoken</s>  from this point withcertain breaks and interruptions my whole interest fixed breathlesslyon the conversation and i followed it word for word</s> crisis</s>  repeated sir

all other occasions he was the last manin the world to forget anything but in the surprise of the moment heapparently forgot the danger of infection from typhus and the urgentnecessity of forcing lady

sorry i am sincerely grieved he said</s>  the fever may ifear be infectious</s>  until i am certain that it is not i entreat youto keep out of the room</s> she struggled for a moment then suddenly

sent up from timeto time to make their inquiries</s>  at last between five and six oclockto our great relief the physician came</s> he was a younger man than mr</s>  dawson very serious and very decided</s> what he thought of the previous treatment i cannot say but it struckme as curious that he put many more questions to myself and to mrs</s> rubelle than he put to the doctor and that he did not appear to listenwith much interest to what mr</s>  dawson said while he was examining mr</s> dawsons patient</s>  i began to suspect from what i observed in thisway that the count had been right about the illness all the waythrough and i was naturally confirmed in that idea when mr</s>  dawsonafter some little delay asked the one important question which thelondon doctor had been sent for to set at rest</s> what is your opinion of the fever</s>  he inquired</s> typhus replied the physician typhus fever beyond all doubt</s> that quiet foreign person mrs</s>  rubelle crossed her thin brown handsin front of her and looked at me with a very significant smile</s>  thecount himself could hardly have appeared more gratified if he had beenpresent in the room and had heard the confirmation of

anxiously</s> countess fosco and myself took it by turns to relieve mrs</s>  rubellemiss halcombes condition growing worse and worse and requiring ourutmost care and attention</s>  it was a terribly trying time</s>  lady glydesupported as mr</s>  dawson said by the constant strain of her suspenseon her sisters account rallied in the most extraordinary manner andshowed a firmness and determination

in every day and she selfdenyingly kept her promise</s>  ifelt it personally so distressing as reminding me of my own afflictionduring my husbands last illness to see how she suffered under thesecircumstances that i must beg not to dwell on this part of the subjectany longer</s>  it is more agreeable to me to mention that no freshdisputes took place between mr</s>  dawson and the count</s>  his lordshipmade all his inquiries by deputy and remained continually in companywith sir percival downstairs</s> on the fifth day the physician came again and gave us a little hope</s> he said the tenth day from the first appearance of the typhus wouldprobably decide the result of the illness and he arranged for histhird visit to take place on that date</s>  the interval passed asbeforeexcept that the count went to london again one morning andreturned at night</s> on the tenth day it pleased a merciful providence to relieve ourhousehold from all further anxiety and alarm</s>  the physician positivelyassured us that miss halcombe was out of danger</s>  she wants no doctornowall she requires is careful watching and nursing for some time tocome and that i see she has</s>  those were his own words</s>  that eveningi read my husbands touching sermon on recovery from sickness withmore happiness and advantage in a spiritual point of view than i everremember to have derived from it before</s> the effect of the good news on poor lady glyde was i grieve to sayquite overpowering</s>  she was too weak to bear the violent reaction andin another day or two she sank into a state of debility and depressionwhich obliged her to keep her room</s>  rest and quiet and change of airafterwards were the best remedies which mr</s>  dawson could suggest forher benefit</s>  it was fortunate that matters were no worse for on thevery day after she took to her room the count and the doctor hadanother disagreementand this time the dispute between them was of soserious a nature that mr</s>  dawson left the house</s> i was not present at the time but i understood that the subject ofdispute was the amount of nourishment which it was necessary to give toassist miss halcombes convalescence after the exhaustion of the fever</s> mr</s>  dawson now that his patient was safe was less inclined than everto submit to unprofessional interference and the count i cannotimagine why lost all the selfcontrol which he had so judiciouslypreserved on former occasions and taunted the doctor over and overagain with his mistake about the fever when it changed to typhus</s>  theunfortunate affair ended in mr</s>  dawsons appealing to sir percival andthreatening now that he could leave without absolute danger to misshalcombe to withdraw from his attendance at blackwater park if thecounts interference was not peremptorily suppressed from that moment</s> sir percivals reply though not designedly uncivil had only resultedin making matters worse and mr</s>  dawson had thereupon withdrawn fromthe house in a state of extreme indignation at count foscos usage ofhim and had sent in his bill the next morning</s> we were now therefore left without the attendance of a medical man</s> although there was no actual necessity for another doctornursing andwatching being as the physician had observed all that miss halcomberequiredi should still if my authority had been consulted haveobtained professional assistance from some other quarter for formssake</s> the matter did not seem to strike sir percival in that light</s>  he saidit would be time enough to send for another doctor if miss halcombeshowed any signs of a relapse</s>  in the meanwhile we had the count toconsult in any minor difficulty and we need not unnecessarily disturbour patient in her present weak and nervous condition by the presenceof a stranger at her bedside</s>  there was much that was reasonable nodoubt in these considerations but they left me a little anxiousnevertheless</s>  nor was i quite satisfied in my own mind of thepropriety of our concealing the doctors absence as we did from ladyglyde</s>  it was a merciful deception i admitfor she was in no stateto bear any fresh anxieties</s>  but still it was a deception and assuch to a person of my principles at best a doubtful proceeding</s> a second perplexing circumstance which happened on the same day andwhich took me completely by surprise added greatly to the sense ofuneasiness that was now weighing on my mind</s> i was sent for to see sir percival in the library</s>  the count who waswith him when i went in

establishment immediately at this placeleavingyou in charge of course as usual</s>  as soon as lady glyde and misshalcombe can travel they must both have change of air</s>  my friendscount fosco and the countess will leave us before that time to live inthe neighbourhood of london and i have reasons for not opening thehouse to any more company with a view to economising as carefully as ican</s>  i

remark conveyed an aspersion of the most offensive kind on mymanagement</s>  i had too much selfrespect to defend myself under sogross an imputation</s>  christian consideration for the helpless positionof miss halcombe and lady glyde and for the serious inconveniencewhich my sudden absence might inflict on them alone prevented me fromresigning my situation on the spot</s>  i rose immediately</s>  it would havelowered me in my own estimation to have permitted the interview tocontinue a moment longer</s> after that last remark sir percival i have nothing more to say</s>

singular a nature that it mighthave caused me a feeling of superstitious surprise if my mind had notbeen fortified by principle against any pagan weakness of that sort</s> the uneasy sense of something wrong in the family which had made mewish myself away from blackwater park was actually followed strangeto say by my departure from the house</s>  it is true that my absence wasfor a temporary period only but the coincidence was in my opinionnot the less remarkable on that account</s> my departure took place under the following circumstancesa day or two after the servants all left i was again sent for to seesir percival</s>  the undeserved slur which he had cast on my managementof the household did not i am happy to say prevent me from returninggood for evil to the best of my ability by complying with his requestas readily and respectfully as ever</s>  it cost me a struggle with thatfallen nature which we all share in common before i could suppress myfeelings</s>  being accustomed to selfdiscipline i accomplished thesacrifice</s> i found sir percival and count fosco sitting together again</s>  on thisoccasion his lordship remained present at the interview and assistedin the development of sir percivals views</s> the subject to which they now requested my attention related to thehealthy change of air by which we all hoped that miss halcombe and ladyglyde might soon be enabled to profit</s>  sir percival mentioned thatboth the ladies would probably pass the autumn by invitation offrederick fairlie esquire at limmeridge house cumberland</s>  butbefore they went there it was his opinion confirmed by count foscowho here took up the conversation and continued it to the end thatthey would benefit by a short residence first in the genial climate oftorquay</s>  the great object therefore was to engage lodgings at thatplace affording all the comforts and advantages of which they stood inneed and the great difficulty was to find an experienced personcapable of choosing the sort of residence which they wanted</s>  in thisemergency the count begged to inquire on sir percivals behalfwhether i would object to give the ladies the benefit of my assistanceby proceeding myself to torquay in their interests</s> it was impossible for a person in my situation to meet any proposalmade in these terms with a positive objection</s> i could only venture to represent the serious inconvenience of myleaving blackwater park in the extraordinary absence of all the indoorservants with the one exception of margaret porcher</s>  but sir percivaland his lordship declared that they were both willing to put up withinconvenience for the sake of the invalids</s>  i next respectfullysuggested writing to an agent at torquay but i was met here by beingreminded of the imprudence of taking lodgings without first seeingthem</s>  i was also informed that the countess who would otherwise havegone to devonshire herself could not in lady glydes presentcondition leave her niece and that sir percival and the count hadbusiness to transact together which would oblige them to remain atblackwater park</s>  in short it was clearly shown me that if i did notundertake the errand no one else could be trusted with it</s>  underthese circumstances i could only inform sir percival that my serviceswere at the disposal of miss halcombe and lady glyde</s> it was thereupon arranged that i should leave the next morning that ishould occupy one or two days in examining all the most convenienthouses in torquay and that i should return with my report as soon as iconveniently could</s>  a memorandum was written for me by his lordshipstating the requisites which the place i was sent to take must be foundto possess and a note of the pecuniary limit assigned to me was addedby sir percival</s> my own idea on reading over these instructions was that no suchresidence as i saw described could be found at any wateringplace inengland and that even if it could by chance be discovered it wouldcertainly not be parted with for any period on such terms as i waspermitted to offer</s>  i hinted at these difficulties to both thegentlemen but sir percival who undertook to answer me did not appearto feel them</s>  it was not for me to dispute the question</s>  i said nomore but i felt a very strong conviction that the business on which iwas sent away was so beset by difficulties that my errand was almosthopeless at starting</s> before i left i took care to satisfy myself that miss halcombe wasgoing on favourably</s> there was a painful expression of anxiety in her face which made mefear that her mind on first recovering itself was not at ease</s>  butshe was certainly strengthening more rapidly than i could have venturedto anticipate and she was able to send kind messages to lady glydesaying that she was fast getting well and entreating her ladyship notto exert herself again too soon</s>  i left her in charge of mrs</s>  rubellewho was still as quietly independent of every one else in the house asever</s>  when i knocked at lady glydes door before going away i wastold that she was still sadly weak and depressed my informant beingthe countess who was then keeping her company in her room</s>  sirpercival and the count were walking on the road to the lodge as i wasdriven by in the chaise</s>  i bowed to them and quitted the house withnot a living soul left in the servants offices but margaret porcher</s> every one must feel what i have felt myself since that time that thesecircumstances were more than unusualthey were</s>  almost suspicious</s> let me however say again that it was impossible for me in mydependent position to act otherwise than i did</s> the result of my errand at torquay was exactly what i had foreseen</s>  nosuch lodgings as i was instructed to take could be found in the wholeplace and the terms i was permitted to give were much too low for thepurpose even if i had been able to discover what i wanted</s>  iaccordingly returned to blackwater park and informed sir percival whomet me at the door that my journey had been taken in vain</s>  he seemedtoo much occupied with some other subject to care about the failure ofmy errand and his first words informed me that even in the short timeof my absence another remarkable change had taken place in the house</s> the count and countess fosco had left blackwater park for their newresidence in st</s>  johns wood</s> i was not made aware of the motive for this sudden departurei wasonly told that the count had been very particular in leaving his kindcompliments to me</s>  when i ventured on asking sir percival whether ladyglyde had any one to attend to her comforts in the absence of thecountess he replied that she had margaret porcher to wait on her andhe added that a woman from the village had been sent for to do the workdownstairs</s> the answer really shocked methere was such a glaring impropriety inpermitting an underhousemaid to fill the place of confidentialattendant on lady glyde</s>  i went upstairs at once and met margaret onthe bedroom landing</s>  her services had not been required naturallyenough her mistress having sufficiently recovered that morning to beable to leave her bed</s>  i asked next after miss halcombe but i wasanswered in a slouching sulky way which left me no wiser than i wasbefore</s> i did not choose to repeat the question and perhaps provoke animpertinent reply</s>  it was in every respect more becoming to a personin my position to present myself immediately in lady glydes room</s> i found that her ladyship had certainly gained in health during thelast few days</s>  although still sadly weak and nervous she was able toget up without assistance and to walk slowly about her room feelingno worse effect from the exertion than a slight sensation of fatigue</s> she had been made a little anxious that morning about miss halcombethrough having received no news of her from any one</s>  i thought thisseemed to imply a blamable want of attention on the part of mrs</s> rubelle but i said nothing and remained with lady glyde to assist herto dress</s>  when she was ready we both left the room together to go tomiss halcombe</s> we were stopped in the passage by the appearance of sir percival</s>  helooked as if he had been purposely waiting there to see us</s> where are you going</s>  he said to lady glyde</s> to marians room she answered</s> it may spare you a disappointment remarked sir percival if i tellyou at once that you will not find her there</s> not find her there</s> no</s>  she left the house yesterday morning with fosco and his wife</s> lady glyde was not strong enough to bear the surprise of thisextraordinary statement</s>  she turned fearfully pale and leaned backagainst the wall looking at her husband in dead silence</s> i was so astonished myself that i hardly knew what to say</s>  i asked sirpercival if he really meant that miss halcombe had left blackwater park</s> i certainly mean it he answered</s> in her state sir percival</s>  without mentioning her intentions to ladyglyde</s> before he could reply her ladyship recovered herself a little and spoke</s> impossible</s>  she cried out in a loud frightened manner taking a stepor two forward from the wall</s>  where was the doctor</s>  where was mr</s> dawson when marian went away</s> mr</s>  dawson wasnt wanted and wasnt here said sir percival</s>  heleft of his own accord which is enough of itself to show that she wasstrong enough to

there was no one in misshalcombes room but margaret porcher who was busy setting it torights</s>  there was no one in the spare rooms or the dressingroomswhen we looked into them afterwards</s>  sir percival still waited for usin the passage</s>  as we were leaving the last room that we had examinedlady glyde whispered dont go mrs</s>  michelson</s>  dont leave me forgods sake</s>  before i could say anything in return she was out again inthe passage speaking to her husband</s>
what does it mean sir percival</s>  i insisti beg and pray you willtell me what it means</s>
it means he answered that miss halcombe was strong enoughyesterday morning to sit up and be dressed and that she insisted ontaking advantage of foscos going to london to go there too</s> to london</s> yeson her way to limmeridge</s> lady glyde turned and appealed to me</s> you saw miss halcombe last she said</s>  tell me plainly mrs</s> michelson did you think she looked fit to travel</s> not in my

why should you write to count fosco</s>  she asked in extreme surprise</s> to tell him to expect you by the midday train said sir percival</s> he will meet you at the station when you get to london

what misunderstanding</s>  inquired her ladyship with a look of suddeninterest</s> i related the unhappy circumstances under which mr</s>  dawson hadwithdrawn his attendancementioning them all the

alarmed me</s> even the patience of mrs</s>  rubelle was getting exhausted when i joinedher at the house door</s> at last</s>  she said with a shrug of her lean foreign shoulders</s>  sheled the way

time at blackwater park</s>  the rooms themselves i knewwell having entered them myself on various occasions from the otherside of the house</s>  mrs</s>  rubelle stopped at the third door along theold gallery handed me the key of it with the key of the door ofcommunication and told me i should find miss halcombe in that room</s> before i went in i thought it desirable to make her understand that herattendance had ceased</s>  accordingly i told her in plain words that thecharge of the sick lady henceforth devolved entirely on myself</s> i am glad to hear it maam said mrs</s>  rubelle</s>  i want to go verymuch</s> do you leave today</s>  i asked to make sure of her</s> now that you have taken charge maam i leave in half an hours time</s> sir percival has kindly placed at my disposition

ofmrs</s>  rubelle</s> when i went into the room miss halcombe was asleep</s>  i looked at heranxiously as she lay in the dismal high oldfashioned bed</s>  she wascertainly not in any respect altered

solitary courtyard at the back of the house wasopened to let in the fresh air and all that could be done to make theplace comfortable had been done</s>  the whole cruelty of sir percivalsdeception had fallen on poor lady glyde</s>  the only illusage whicheither he or mrs</s>  rubelle had inflicted on miss halcombe consisted sofar as i could see in the first offence of hiding her away</s> i stole back leaving the sick lady still peacefully asleep to givethe gardener instructions about bringing the doctor</s>  i begged the manafter he had taken mrs</s>  rubelle to the station to drive round by mr</s> dawsons and leave a message in my name asking him to call and seeme</s>  i knew he would come on my account and i knew he would remainwhen he found count fosco had left the house</s> in due course of time the gardener returned and said that he haddriven round by mr</s>  dawsons residence after leaving mrs</s>  rubelle atthe station</s>  the doctor sent me word that he was poorly in healthhimself but that he would call if possible the next morning</s> having delivered his message the gardener was about to withdraw but istopped him to request that he would come back before dark and sit upthat night in one of the empty bedrooms so as to be within call incase i wanted him</s>  he understood readily enough my unwillingness to beleft alone all night in the most desolate part of that desolate houseand we arranged that he should come in between eight and nine</s> he came punctually and i found cause to be thankful that i had adoptedthe precaution of calling him in</s>  before midnight sir percivalsstrange temper broke out in the most violent and most alarming mannerand if the gardener had not been on the spot to pacify him on theinstant i am afraid to think what might have happened</s> almost all the afternoon and evening he had been walking about thehouse and grounds in an unsettled excitable manner having in allprobability as i thought taken an excessive quantity of wine at hissolitary dinner</s>  however that may be i heard his voice calling loudlyand angrily in the new wing of the house as i was taking a turnbackwards and forwards along the gallery the last thing at night</s>  thegardener immediately ran down to him and i closed the door ofcommunication to keep the alarm if possible from reaching misshalcombes ears</s>  it was full half an hour before the gardener cameback</s>  he declared that his master was quite out of his sensesnotthrough the excitement of drink as i had supposed but through a kindof panic or frenzy of mind for which it was impossible to account</s>  hehad found sir percival walking backwards and forwards by himself in thehall swearing with every appearance of the most violent passion thathe would not stop another minute alone in such a dungeon as his ownhouse and that he would take the first stage of his journeyimmediately in the middle of the night</s>  the gardener on approachinghim had been hunted out with oaths and threats to get the horse andchaise ready instantly</s>  in a quarter of an hour sir percival hadjoined him in the yard had jumped into the chaise and lashing thehorse into a gallop had driven himself away with his face as pale asashes in the moonlight</s>  the gardener had heard him shouting andcursing at the lodgekeeper to get up and open the gatehad heard thewheels roll furiously on again in the still night when the gate wasunlockedand knew no more</s> the next day or a day or two after i forget which the chaise wasbrought back from knowlesbury our nearest town by the ostler at

wakingand of what passed between us when she found me sitting by her bedsideare not material to the purpose which is to be answered by the presentnarrative</s>  it will be sufficient for me to say in this place that shewas not herself conscious of the means adopted to remove her from theinhabited to the uninhabited part of the house</s>  she was in a deepsleep at the time whether naturally or artificially produced she couldnot say</s>  in my absence at torquay and in the absence of all theresident servants except margaret porcher who was perpetually eatingdrinking or sleeping when she was not at work the secret transferof miss halcombe from one part of the house to the other was no doubteasily performed</s>  mrs</s>  rubelle as i discovered for myself in lookingabout the room had provisions and all other necessaries togetherwith the means of heating water broth and so on without kindling afire placed at her disposal during the few days of her imprisonmentwith the sick lady</s>  she had declined to answer the questions whichmiss halcombe naturally put but had not in other respects treatedher with unkindness or neglect</s>  the disgrace of lending herself to avile deception is the only disgrace with which i can conscientiouslycharge mrs</s>  rubelle</s> i need write no particulars and i am relieved to know it of theeffect produced on miss halcombe by the news of lady glydes departureor by the far more melancholy tidings which reached us only too soonafterwards at blackwater park</s>  in both cases i prepared her mindbeforehand as gently and as carefully as possible having the doctorsadvice to guide me in the last case only through mr</s>  dawsons beingtoo unwell to come to the house for some days after i had sent for him</s> it was a sad time a time

relatedattaches to count fosco</s>  i am informed that a dreadful suspicion hasbeen raised and that some very serious constructions are placed uponhis lordships conduct</s>  my persuasion of the counts innocenceremains however quite unshaken</s>  if he assisted sir percival insending me to torquay he assisted under a delusion for which as aforeigner and a stranger he was not to blame</s>  if he was concerned inbringing mrs</s>  rubelle to blackwater park it was his misfortune and nothis fault when that foreign person was base enough to assist adeception planned and carried out by the master of the house</s>  iprotest in the interests of morality against blame being gratuitouslyand wantonly attached to the proceedings of the count</s> in the second place i desire to express my regret at my own inabilityto remember the precise day on which lady glyde left blackwater parkfor london</s>  i am told that it is of the last importance to ascertainthe exact date of that lamentable journey and i have anxiously taxedmy memory to recall it</s>  the effort has been in vain</s>  i can onlyremember now that it was towards the latter part of july</s>  we all knowthe difficulty after a

with the details of hisnieces last illness and death</s>  the letter presenting this informationadded no new facts to the facts already known but one very remarkableparagraph was contained in the postscript</s>  it referred to annecatherick</s> the substance of the paragraph in question was as followsit first informed mr</s>  fairlie that anne catherick of whom he mighthear full particulars from miss halcombe when she reached limmeridgehad been traced and recovered in the neighbourhood of blackwater parkand had been for the second time placed under the charge of the medicalman from whose custody she had once escaped</s> this was the first part of the postscript</s>  the second part warned mr</s> fairlie that anne cathericks mental malady had been aggravated by herlong freedom from control and that the insane hatred and distrust ofsir percival glyde which had been one of her most marked delusions informer times still existed under a newlyacquired form</s>  theunfortunate womans last idea in connection with sir percival was theidea of annoying and distressing him and of elevating herself as shesupposed in the estimation of the patients and nurses by assuming thecharacter of his deceased wife the scheme of this personation havingevidently occurred to her after a stolen interview which she hadsucceeded in obtaining with lady glyde and at which she had observedthe extraordinary accidental likeness between the deceased lady andherself</s>  it was to the last degree improbable that she would succeed asecond time in escaping from the asylum but it was just possible shemight find some means of annoying the late lady glydes relatives withletters and in that case mr</s>  fairlie was warned beforehand how toreceive them</s> the postscript expressed in these terms was shown to miss halcombewhen she arrived at limmeridge</s>  there were also placed in herpossession the clothes lady glyde had worn and the other effects shehad brought with her to her aunts

not mention theaddress of the asylum that important omission cast no difficulties inmiss halcombes way</s>  when mr</s>  hartright had met anne catherick atlimmeridge she had informed him of the locality in which the house wassituated and miss halcombe had noted down the direction in her diarywith all the other particulars of the interview exactly as she heardthem from mr</s>  hartrights own lips</s>  accordingly she looked back at theentry and extracted the addressfurnished herself with the countsletter to mr</s>  fairlie as a species of credential which might be usefulto her and started

mrs</s>  veseys agitation at the sight of her lost pupilsnearest and dearest friend was so distressing that miss halcombeconsiderately refrained from remaining in her presence and removed toa respectable boardinghouse in the neighbourhood recommended by mrs</s> veseys married sister</s>  the next day she proceeded to the asylumwhich was situated not far from london on the northern side of themetropolis</s> she was immediately admitted to see the proprietor</s> at first he appeared to be decidedly unwilling to let her communicatewith his patient</s>  but on her showing him the postscript to countfoscos letteron her reminding him that she was the miss halcombethere referred tothat she was a near relative of the deceased ladyglydeand that she was therefore naturally interested for familyreasons in observing for herself the extent of anne cathericksdelusion in relation to her late sisterthe tone and manner of theowner of the asylum altered and he withdrew his objections</s>  heprobably felt that a continued refusal under these circumstanceswould not only be an act of discourtesy in itself but would also implythat the proceedings in his establishment were not of a nature to bearinvestigation by respectable strangers</s> miss halcombes own impression was that the owner of the asylum had notbeen received into the confidence of sir percival and the count</s>  hisconsenting at all to let her visit his patient seemed to afford oneproof of this and his readiness in making admissions which couldscarcely have escaped the lips of an accomplice certainly appeared tofurnish another</s> for example in the course of the introductory conversation which tookplace he informed miss halcombe that anne catherick had been broughtback to him with the necessary order and certificates by count fosco onthe twentyseventh of julythe count also producing a letter ofexplanations and instructions signed by sir percival glyde</s>  onreceiving his inmate again the proprietor of the asylum acknowledgedthat he had observed some curious personal changes in her</s>  suchchanges no doubt were not without precedent in his experience ofpersons mentally afflicted</s>  insane people were often at one timeoutwardly as well as inwardly unlike what they were at anotherthechange from better to worse or from worse to better in the madnesshaving a necessary tendency to produce alterations of appearanceexternally</s>  he allowed for these and he allowed also for themodification in the form of anne cathericks delusion which wasreflected no doubt in her manner and expression</s>  but he was stillperplexed at times by certain differences between his patient beforeshe had escaped and his patient since she had been brought back</s>  thosedifferences were too minute to be described</s>  he could not say ofcourse that she was absolutely altered in height or shape orcomplexion or in the colour of her hair and eyes or in the generalform of her facethe change was something that he felt more thansomething that he saw</s>  in short the case had been a puzzle from thefirst and one more perplexity was added to it now</s> it cannot be said that this conversation led to the result of evenpartially preparing miss halcombes mind for what was to come</s>  but itproduced nevertheless a very serious effect upon her</s>  she was socompletely unnerved by it that some little time elapsed before shecould summon composure enough to follow the proprietor of the asylum tothat part of the house in which the inmates were confined</s> on inquiry it turned out that the supposed anne catherick was thentaking exercise in the grounds attached to the establishment</s>  one ofthe nurses volunteered to conduct miss halcombe to the place theproprietor of the asylum remaining in the house for a few minutes toattend to a case which required his services and then engaging to joinhis visitor in the grounds</s> the nurse led miss halcombe to a distant part of the property whichwas prettily laid out and after looking about her a little turnedinto a turf walk shaded by a shrubbery on either side</s>  about halfwaydown this walk two women were slowly approaching</s>  the nurse pointed tothem and said there is anne catherick maam with the attendant whowaits on her</s>  the attendant will answer any questions you wish toput</s>  with those words the nurse left her to return to the duties ofthe house</s> miss halcombe advanced on her side and the women advanced on theirs</s> when they were within a dozen paces of each other one of the womenstopped for an instant looked eagerly at the strange lady shook offthe nurses grasp on her and the next moment rushed into misshalcombes arms</s>  in that moment miss halcombe recognised hersisterrecognised the deadalive</s> fortunately for the success of the measures taken subsequently no onewas present at that moment but the nurse</s>  she was a young woman andshe was so startled that she was at first quite incapable ofinterfering</s>  when she was able to do so her whole services wererequired by miss halcombe who had for the moment sunk altogether inthe effort to keep her own senses under the shock of the discovery</s> after waiting a few minutes in the fresh air and the cool shade hernatural energy and courage helped her a little and she becamesufficiently mistress of herself to feel the necessity of recalling herpresence of mind for her unfortunate sisters sake</s> she obtained permission to speak alone with the patient on conditionthat they both remained well within the nurses view</s>  there was no timefor questionsthere was only time for miss halcombe to impress on theunhappy lady the necessity of controlling herself and to assure her ofimmediate help and rescue if she did so</s>  the prospect of escaping fromthe asylum by obedience to her sisters directions was sufficient toquiet lady glyde and to make her understand what was required of her</s> miss halcombe next returned to the nurse placed all the gold she thenhad in her pocket three sovereigns in the nurses hands and askedwhen and where she could speak to her alone</s> the woman was at first surprised and distrustful</s>  but on misshalcombes declaring that she only wanted to put some questions whichshe was too much agitated to ask at that moment and that she had nointention of misleading the nurse into any dereliction of duty thewoman took the money and proposed three oclock on the next day as thetime for the interview</s>  she might then slip out for half an hourafter the patients had dined and she would meet the lady in a retiredplace outside the high north wall which screened the grounds of thehouse</s>  miss halcombe had only time to assent and to whisper to hersister that she should hear from her on the next day when theproprietor of the asylum joined them</s>  he noticed his visitorsagitation which miss halcombe accounted for by saying that herinterview with anne catherick had a little startled her at first</s>  shetook her leave as soon after as possiblethat is to say as soon asshe could summon courage to force herself from the presence of herunfortunate sister</s> a very little reflection when the capacity to reflect returnedconvinced her that any attempt to identify lady glyde and to rescue herby legal means would even if successful involve a delay that mightbe fatal to her sisters intellects which were shaken already by thehorror of the situation to which she had been consigned</s>  by the timemiss halcombe had got back to london she had determined to effect ladyglydes escape privately by means of the nurse</s> she went at once to her stockbroker and sold out of the funds all thelittle property she possessed amounting to rather less than sevenhundred pounds</s>  determined if necessary to pay the price of hersisters liberty with every farthing she had in the world she repairedthe next day having the whole sum about her in banknotes to herappointment outside the asylum wall</s> the nurse was there</s>  miss halcombe approached the subject cautiouslyby many preliminary questions</s>  she discovered among otherparticulars that the nurse who had in former times attended on thetrue anne catherick had been held responsible although she was not toblame for it for the patients escape and had lost her place inconsequence</s>  the same penalty it was added would attach to theperson then speaking to her if the supposed anne catherick was missinga second time and moreover the nurse in this case had an especialinterest in keeping her place</s>  she was engaged to be married and sheand her future husband were waiting till they could save togetherbetween two and three hundred pounds to start in business</s>  the nurseswages were good and she might succeed by strict economy incontributing her small share towards the sum required in two yearstime</s> on this hint miss halcombe spoke</s>  she declared that the supposed annecatherick was nearly related to her that she had been placed in theasylum under a fatal mistake and that the nurse would be doing a goodand a christian action in being the means of restoring them to oneanother</s>  before there was time to start a single objection misshalcombe took four banknotes of a hundred pounds each from herpocketbook and offered them to the woman as a compensation for therisk she was to run and for the loss of her place</s> the nurse hesitated through sheer incredulity and surprise</s>  misshalcombe pressed the point on her firmly</s> you will be doing a good action she repeated you will be helpingthe most injured and unhappy woman alive</s>  there is your marriageportion for a reward</s>  bring her safely to me here and i will

momentthey met miss halcombe put the banknotes and the letter into her handand the sisters were united again</s> the nurse had dressed lady glyde with excellent forethought in abonnet veil and shawl

in the hearing of the other nurses that anne catherick hadbeen inquiring latterly about the distance from london to hampshire towait till the last moment before discovery was inevitable and then togive the alarm that anne was missing</s>  the supposed inquiries abouthampshire when communicated to the owner of the asylum would lead himto imagine that his patient had returned to blackwater park

follow these suggestions the more readily asthey offered her the means of securing herself against any worseconsequences than the loss of her place by remaining in the asylumand so maintaining the

themselves and widely detached fromeach other</s>  imperfect as the revelation was it must nevertheless berecorded here before this explanatory narrative closes with the eventsof the next day at limmeridge house</s> lady glydes recollection of the events which followed her departurefrom blackwater park began with her arrival at the london terminus ofthe south western railway</s>  she had omitted to make a memorandumbeforehand of the day on which she took the journey</s>  all hope offixing that important date by any evidence of hers or of mrs</s> michelsons must be given up for

crowded and there wasgreat confusion in getting the luggage</s>  some person whom count foscobrought with him procured the luggage which belonged to lady glyde</s>  itwas marked with her name</s>  she drove away alone with the count in avehicle which she did not particularly notice at the time</s> her first question on leaving the terminus referred to miss halcombe</s> the count informed her that miss halcombe had not yet gone tocumberland afterconsideration having caused him to doubt the prudenceof her taking so long a journey without some days previous rest</s> lady glyde next inquired whether her sister was then staying in thecounts house</s>  her recollection of the answer was confused her onlydistinct impression in relation to it being that the count declared hewas then taking her to see miss halcombe</s>  lady glydes experience oflondon was so limited that she could not tell at the time throughwhat streets they were driving</s>  but they never left the streets andthey never passed any gardens or trees</s>  when the carriage stopped itstopped in a small street behind a squarea square in which there wereshops and public buildings and many people</s>  from these recollectionsof which lady glyde was certain it seems quite clear that count foscodid not take her to his own residence in the suburb of st</s>  johns wood</s> they entered the house and went upstairs to a back room either on thefirst or second floor</s>  the luggage was carefully brought in</s>  a femaleservant opened the door and a man with a dark beard apparently aforeigner met them in the hall

thoughts ofventuring downstairs again and claiming the protection and assistanceof the only woman she had seen in the housethe servant who answeredthe door</s> just as she had risen from her chair the count came back into the room</s> the moment he appeared she asked anxiously how long the meeting betweenher sister and herself was to be still delayed</s>  at first he returnedan evasive answer but on being pressed he acknowledged with greatapparent reluctance that miss halcombe was by no means so well as hehad hitherto represented her to be</s>  his tone and manner in making thisreply so alarmed lady glyde or rather so painfully increased theuneasiness which she had felt in the company of the two strangers thata sudden faintness overcame her and she was obliged to ask for a glassof water</s>  the count called from the door for water and for a bottle ofsmellingsalts</s>  both were brought in by the foreignlooking man withthe beard</s>  the water when lady glyde attempted to drink

be describedmiss halcombe herself shrank fromreferring to it</s>  let it be enough to say that mr</s>  fairlie declared inthe most positive terms that he did not recognise the woman who hadbeen

exposure even in thehouse where she was born and among the people with whom she had lived</s> in a less critical situation the effort need not have been given up ashopeless even yet</s> for example the maid fanny who happened to be then absent fromlimmeridge was expected back in two days and there would be a chanceof gaining her recognition to start with seeing that she had been inmuch more

towards one of the quietest of the large squares on the north ofholborn then suddenly stopped and turned round at a place where a longstretch of pavement was left behind me</s> there were two men at

yesi see</s>  but how is the proof to be obtained</s> mrs</s>  michelsons narrative has suggested to me two ways of trying toobtain it</s>  one of them is to question the doctor mr</s>  dawson who

london enabled me to reach mr</s>  dawsons housein the forenoon</s>  our interview so far as the object of my visit wasconcerned led to no satisfactory result</s> mr</s>  dawsons books certainly showed when he had resumed his attendanceon miss halcombe at blackwater park but it was not possible tocalculate back from this date with any exactness without such helpfrom mrs</s>  michelson as i knew she was unable to afford</s>  she could notsay from memory who in similar cases ever can</s>  how many days hadelapsed between the renewal of the doctors attendance on his patientand the previous departure of lady glyde</s>  she was almost certain ofhaving mentioned the circumstance of the departure to miss halcombe onthe day after it happenedbut then she was no more able to fix thedate of the day on which this disclosure took place than to fix thedate of the day before when lady glyde had left for london</s>  neithercould she calculate with any nearer approach to exactness the timethat had passed from the departure of her mistress to the period whenthe undated letter from madame fosco arrived</s>  lastly as if tocomplete the series of difficulties the doctor himself having beenill at the time had omitted to make his usual entry of the day of theweek and month when the gardener from blackwater park had called on himto deliver mrs</s>  michelsons message</s> hopeless of obtaining assistance from mr</s>  dawson i resolved to trynext if i could establish the date of sir percivals arrival atknowlesbury</s> it seemed like a fatality</s>  when i reached knowlesbury the inn was shutup and bills were posted on the walls</s>  the speculation had been a badone as i was informed ever since the time of the railway</s>  the newhotel at the station had gradually absorbed the business and the oldinn which we knew to be the inn at which sir percival had put up hadbeen closed about two months since</s>  the proprietor had left the townwith all his goods and chattels and where he had gone i could notpositively ascertain from any one</s>  the four people of whom i inquiredgave me four different accounts of his plans and projects when he leftknowlesbury</s> there were still some hours to spare before the last train left forlondon and i drove back again in a fly from the knowlesbury station toblackwater park with the purpose of questioning the gardener and theperson who kept the lodge</s>  if they too proved unable to assist memy resources for the present were at an end and i might return to town</s> i dismissed the fly a mile distant from the park and getting mydirections from the driver proceeded by myself to the house</s> as i turned into the lane from the highroad i saw a man with acarpetbag walking before me rapidly on the way to the lodge</s>  he wasa little man dressed in shabby black and wearing a remarkably largehat</s>  i set him down as well as it was possible to judge for alawyers clerk and stopped at once to widen the distance between us</s> he had not heard me and he walked on out of sight without lookingback</s>  when i passed through the gates myself a little whileafterwards he was not visiblehe had evidently gone on to the house</s> there were two women in the lodge</s>  one of them was old the other iknew at once by marians description of her to be margaret porcher</s> i asked first if sir percival was at the park and receiving a reply inthe negative inquired next when he had left it</s>  neither of the womencould tell me more than that he had gone away in the summer</s>  i couldextract nothing from margaret porcher but vacant smiles and shakings ofthe head</s>  the old woman was a little more intelligent and i managedto lead her into speaking of the manner of sir percivals departureand of the alarm that it caused her</s>  she remembered her master callingher out of bed and remembered his frightening her by swearingbut thedate at which the occurrence happened was as she honestlyacknowledged quite beyond her</s> on leaving the lodge i saw the gardener at work not far off</s>  when ifirst addressed him he looked at me rather distrustfully but on myusing mrs</s>  michelsons name with a civil reference to himself heentered into conversation readily enough</s>  there is no need to describewhat passed between usit ended as all my other attempts to discoverthe date had ended</s>  the gardener knew that his master had driven awayat night some time in july the last fortnight or the last ten daysin the monthand knew no more</s> while we were speaking together i saw the man in black with the largehat come out from the house and stand at some little distanceobserving us</s> certain suspicions of his errand at blackwater park had already crossedmy mind</s>  they were now increased by the gardeners inability orunwillingness to tell me who the man was and i determined to clearthe way before me if possible by speaking to him</s>  the plainestquestion i could put as a stranger would be to inquire if the house wasallowed to be shown to visitors</s>  i walked up to the man at once andaccosted him in those words</s> his look and manner unmistakably betrayed that he knew who i was andthat he wanted to irritate me into quarrelling with him</s>  his reply wasinsolent enough to have answered the purpose if i had been lessdetermined to control myself</s>  as it was i met him with the mostresolute politeness apologised for my involuntary intrusion which hecalled a trespass and left the grounds</s>  it was exactly as isuspected</s>  the recognition of me when i left mr</s>  kyrles office hadbeen evidently communicated to sir percival glyde and the man in blackhad been sent to the park in anticipation of my making inquiries at thehouse or in the neighbourhood</s>  if i had given him the least chance oflodging any sort of legal complaint against me the interference of thelocal magistrate would no doubt have been turned to account as a clogon my proceedings and a means of separating me from marian and laurafor some days at least</s> i was prepared to be watched on the way from blackwater park to thestation exactly as i had been watched in london the day before</s>  but icould not discover at the time whether i was really followed on thisoccasion or not</s>  the man in black might have had means of tracking meat his disposal of which i was not aware but i certainly saw nothingof him in his own person either on the way to the station orafterwards on my arrival at the london terminus in the evening</s>  ireached home on foot taking the precaution before i approached ourown door of walking round by the loneliest street in theneighbourhood and there stopping and looking back more than once overthe open space behind me</s>  i had first learnt to use this stratagemagainst suspected treachery in the wilds of central americaand now iwas practising it again with the same purpose and with even greatercaution in the heart of civilised london</s> nothing had happened to alarm marian during my absence</s>  she askedeagerly what success i had met with</s>  when i told her she could notconceal her surprise at the indifference with which i spoke of thefailure of my investigations thus far</s> the truth was that the illsuccess of my inquiries had in no sensedaunted me</s>  i had pursued them as a matter of duty and i had expectednothing from them</s>  in the state of my mind at that time it was almosta relief to me to know that the struggle was now narrowed to a trial ofstrength between myself and sir percival glyde</s>  the vindictive motivehad mingled itself all along with my other and better motives and iconfess it was a satisfaction to me to feel that the surest way theonly way left of serving lauras cause was to fasten my hold firmlyon the villain who had married her</s> while i acknowledge that i was not strong enough to keep my motivesabove the reach of this instinct of revenge i can honestly saysomething in my own favour on the other side</s>  no base speculation onthe future relations of laura and myself and on the private andpersonal concessions which i might force from sir percival if i oncehad him at my mercy ever entered my mind</s>  i never said to myself ifi do succeed it shall be one result of my success that i put it out ofher husbands power to take her from me again</s>  i could not look at herand think of the future with such thoughts as those</s>  the sad sight ofthe change in her from her former self made the one interest of mylove an interest of tenderness and compassion which her father or herbrother might have felt and which i felt god knows in my inmostheart</s>  all my hopes looked no farther on now than to the day of herrecovery</s>  there till she was strong again and happy againthere tillshe could look at me as she had once looked and speak to me as she hadonce spokenthe future of my happiest thoughts and my dearest wishesended</s> these words are written under no prompting of idle selfcontemplation</s> passages in this narrative are soon to come which will set the minds ofothers in judgment on my conduct</s>  it is right that the best and theworst of me should be fairly balanced before that time</s> on the morning after my return from hampshire i took marian upstairsinto my workingroom and there laid before her the plan that i hadmatured thus far for mastering the one assailable point in the life ofsir percival glyde</s> the way to the secret lay through the mystery hitherto impenetrable toall of us of the woman in white</s>  the approach to that in its turnmight be gained by obtaining the assistance of anne cathericks motherand the only ascertainable means of prevailing on mrs</s>  catherick to actor to speak in the matter depended on the chance of my discoveringlocal particulars and family particulars first of all from mrs</s> clements</s>  after thinking the subject over carefully i felt certainthat i could only begin the new inquiries by placing myself incommunication with the faithful friend and protectress of annecatherick</s> the first difficulty then was to find mrs</s>  clements</s> i was indebted to marians quick perception for meeting this necessityat once by the best and simplest means</s>  she proposed to write to thefarm near limmeridge todds corner to inquire whether mrs</s>  clementshad communicated with mrs</s>  todd during the past few months</s>  how mrs</s> clements had been separated from anne it was impossible for us to saybut that separation once effected it would certainly occur to mrs</s> clements to inquire after the missing woman in the neighbourhood of allothers to which she was known to be most attachedthe neighbourhood oflimmeridge</s>  i saw directly that marians proposal offered us aprospect of success and she wrote to mrs</s>  todd accordingly by thatdays post</s> while we were waiting for the reply i made myself master of all theinformation marian could afford on the subject of sir percivalsfamily and of his early life</s>  she could only speak on these topicsfrom hearsay but she was reasonably certain of the truth of whatlittle she had to tell</s> sir percival was an only child</s>  his father sir felix glyde hadsuffered from his birth under a painful and incurable deformity andhad shunned all society from his earliest years</s>  his sole happinesswas in the enjoyment of music and he had married a lady with tastessimilar to his own who was said to be a most accomplished musician</s> he inherited the blackwater property while still a young man</s>  neitherhe nor his wife after taking possession made advances of any sorttowards the society of the neighbourhood and no one endeavoured totempt them into abandoning their reserve with the one disastrousexception of the rector of the parish</s> the rector was the worst of all innocent mischiefmakersanoverzealous man</s>  he had heard that sir felix had left college withthe character of being little better than a revolutionist in politicsand an infidel in religion and he arrived conscientiously at theconclusion that it was his bounden duty to summon the lord of the manorto hear sound views enunciated in the parish church</s>  sir felixfiercely resented the clergymans wellmeant but illdirectedinterference insulting him so grossly and so publicly that thefamilies in the neighbourhood sent letters of indignant remonstrance tothe park and even the tenants of the blackwater property expressedtheir opinion as strongly as they dared</s>  the baronet who had nocountry tastes of any kind and no attachment to the estate or to anyone living on it declared that society at blackwater should never havea second chance of annoying him and left the place from that moment</s> after a short residence in london he and his wife departed for thecontinent and never returned to england again</s>  they lived part of thetime in france and part in germanyalways keeping themselves in thestrict retirement which the morbid sense of his own personal deformityhad made a necessity to sir felix</s>  their son percival had been bornabroad and had been educated there by private tutors</s>  his mother wasthe first of his parents whom he lost</s>  his father had died a few yearsafter her either in 1825 or 1826</s>  sir percival had been in englandas a young man once or twice before that period but his acquaintancewith the late mr</s>  fairlie did not begin till after the time of hisfathers death</s>  they soon became very intimate although sir percivalwas seldom or never at limmeridge house in those days</s>  mr</s>  frederickfairlie might have met him once or twice in mr</s>  philip fairliescompany but he could have known little of him at that or at any othertime</s>  sir percivals only intimate friend in the fairlie family hadbeen lauras father</s> these were all the particulars that i could gain from marian</s>  theysuggested nothing which was useful to my present purpose but i notedthem down carefully in the event of their proving to be of importanceat any future period</s> mrs</s>  todds reply addressed by our own wish to a postoffice at somedistance from us had arrived at its destination when i went to applyfor it</s>  the chances which had been all against us hitherto turnedfrom this moment in our favour</s>  mrs</s>  todds letter contained the firstitem of information of which we were in search</s> mrs</s>  clements it appeared had as we had conjectured written totodds corner asking pardon in the first place for the abrupt mannerin which she and anne had left their friends at the farmhouse on themorning after i had met the woman in white in limmeridge churchyardand then informing mrs</s>  todd of annes disappearance and entreatingthat she would cause inquiries to be made in the neighbourhood on thechance that the lost woman might have strayed back to limmeridge</s>  inmaking this request mrs</s>  clements had been careful to add to it theaddress at which she might always be heard of and that address mrs</s> todd now transmitted to marian</s>  it was in london and within half anhours walk of our own lodging</s> in the words of the proverb i was resolved not to let the grass growunder my feet</s>  the next morning i set forth to seek an interview withmrs</s>  clements</s>  this was my first step forward in the investigation</s> the story of the desperate attempt to which i now stood committedbegins here</s> vithe address communicated by mrs</s>  todd took me to a lodginghousesituated in a respectable street near the grays inn road</s> when i knocked the door was opened by mrs</s>  clements herself</s>  she didnot appear to remember me and asked what my business was</s>  i recalledto her our meeting in limmeridge churchyard at the close of myinterview there with the woman in white taking special care to remindher that i was the person who assisted anne catherick as anne hadherself declared to escape the pursuit from the asylum</s>  this was myonly claim to the confidence of mrs</s>  clements</s>  she remembered thecircumstance the moment i spoke of it and asked me into the parlourin the greatest anxiety to know if i had brought her any news of anne</s> it was impossible for me to tell her the whole truth without at thesame time entering into particulars on the subject of the conspiracywhich it would have been dangerous to confide to a stranger</s>  i couldonly abstain most carefully from raising any false hopes and thenexplain that the object of my visit was to discover the persons whowere really responsible for annes disappearance</s>  i even added so asto exonerate myself from any afterreproach of my own conscience thati entertained not the least hope of being able to trace herthat ibelieved we should never see her alive againand that my main interestin the affair was to bring to punishment two men whom i suspected to beconcerned in luring her away and at whose hands i and some dearfriends of mine had suffered a grievous wrong</s>  with this explanation ileft it to mrs</s>  clements to say whether our interest in the matterwhatever difference there might be in the motives which actuated uswas not the same and whether she felt any reluctance to forward myobject by giving me such information on the subject of my inquiries asshe happened to possess</s> the poor woman was at first too much confused and agitated tounderstand thoroughly what i said to her</s>  she could only reply that iwas welcome to anything she could tell me in return for the kindness ihad shown to anne but as she was not very quick and ready at the bestof times in talking to strangers she would beg me to put her in theright way and to say where i wished her to begin</s> knowing by experience that the plainest narrative attainable frompersons who are not accustomed to arrange their ideas is the narrativewhich goes far enough back at the beginning to avoid all impediments ofretrospection in its course i asked mrs</s>  clements to tell me firstwhat had happened after she had left limmeridge and so by watchfulquestioning carried her on from point to point till we reached theperiod of annes disappearance</s> the substance of the information which i thus obtained was as followson leaving the farm at todds corner mrs</s>  clements and anne hadtravelled that day as far as derby and had remained there a week onannes account</s>  they had then gone on to london and had lived in thelodging occupied by mrs</s>  clements at that time for a month or morewhen circumstances connected with the house and the landlord hadobliged them to change their quarters</s>  annes terror of beingdiscovered in london or its neighbourhood whenever they ventured towalk out had gradually communicated itself to mrs</s>  clements and shehad determined on removing to one of the most outoftheway places inenglandto the town of grimsby in lincolnshire where her deceasedhusband had passed all his early life</s>  his relatives were respectablepeople settled in the townthey had always treated mrs</s>  clements withgreat kindness and she thought it impossible to do better than gothere and take the advice of her husbands friends</s>  anne would nothear of returning to her mother at welmingham because she had beenremoved to the asylum from that place and because sir percival wouldbe certain to go back there and find her again</s>  there was seriousweight in this objection and mrs</s>  clements felt that it was not to beeasily removed</s> at grimsby the first serious symptoms of illness had shown themselvesin anne</s>  they appeared soon after the news of lady glydes marriagehad been made public in the newspapers and had reached her throughthat medium</s> the medical man who was sent for to attend the sick woman discovered atonce that she was suffering from a serious affection of the heart</s>  theillness lasted long left her very weak and returned at intervalsthough with mitigated severity again and again</s>  they remained atgrimsby in consequence during the first half of the new year andthere they might probably have stayed much longer but for the suddenresolution which anne took at this time to venture back to hampshirefor the purpose of obtaining a private interview with lady glyde</s> mrs</s>  clements did all in her power to oppose the execution of thishazardous and unaccountable project</s>  no explanation of her motives wasoffered by anne except that she believed the day of her death was notfar off and that she had something on her mind which must becommunicated to lady glyde at any risk in secret</s>  her resolution toaccomplish this purpose was so firmly settled that she declared herintention of going to hampshire by herself if mrs</s>  clements felt anyunwillingness to go with her</s>  the doctor on being consulted was ofopinion that serious opposition to her wishes would in allprobability produce another and perhaps a fatal fit of illness andmrs</s>  clements under this advice yielded to necessity and once morewith sad forebodings of trouble and danger to come allowed annecatherick to have her own way</s> on the journey from london to hampshire mrs</s>  clements discovered thatone of their fellowpassengers was well acquainted with theneighbourhood of blackwater and could give her all the information sheneeded on the subject of localities</s>  in this way she found out thatthe only place they could go to which was not dangerously near to sirpercivals residence was a large village called sandon</s>  the distancehere from blackwater park was between three and four milesand thatdistance and back again anne had walked on each occasion when she hadappeared in the neighbourhood of the lake</s> for the few days during which they were at sandon without beingdiscovered they had lived a little away from the village in thecottage of a decent widowwoman who had a bedroom to let and whosediscreet silence mrs</s>  clements had done her best to secure for thefirst week at least</s>  she had also tried hard to induce anne to becontent with writing to lady glyde in the first instance but thefailure of the warning contained in the anonymous letter sent tolimmeridge had made anne resolute to speak this time and obstinate inthe determination to go on her errand alone</s> mrs</s>  clements nevertheless followed her privately on each occasionwhen she went to the lake without however venturing near enough tothe boathouse to be witness of what took place there</s>  when annereturned for the last time from the dangerous neighbourhood thefatigue of walking day after day distances which were far too greatfor her strength added to the exhausting effect of the agitation fromwhich she had suffered produced the result which mrs</s>  clements haddreaded all along</s>  the old pain over the heart and the other symptomsof the illness at grimsby returned and anne was confined to her bed inthe cottage</s> in this emergency the first necessity as mrs</s>  clements knew byexperience was to endeavour to quiet annes anxiety of mind and forthis purpose the good woman went herself the next day to the lake totry if she could find lady glyde who would be sure as anne said totake her daily walk to the boathouse and prevail on her to come backprivately to the cottage near sandon</s>  on reaching the outskirts of theplantation mrs</s>  clements encountered not lady glyde but a tallstout elderly gentleman with a book in his handin other wordscount fosco</s> the count after looking at her very attentively for a moment asked ifshe expected to see any one in that place and added before she couldreply that he was waiting there with a message from lady glyde butthat he was not quite certain whether the person then before himanswered the description of the person with whom he was desired tocommunicate</s> upon this mrs</s>  clements at once confided her errand to him andentreated that he would help to allay annes anxiety by trusting hismessage to her</s>  the count most readily and kindly complied with herrequest</s>  the message he said was a very important one</s>  lady glydeentreated anne and her good friend to return immediately to london asshe felt certain that sir percival would discover them if they remainedany longer in the neighbourhood of blackwater</s>  she was herself goingto london in a short time and if mrs</s>  clements and anne would go therefirst and would let her know what their address was they should hearfrom her and see her in a fortnight or less</s>  the count added that hehad already attempted to give a friendly warning to anne herself butthat she had been too much startled by seeing that he was a stranger tolet him approach and speak to her</s> to this mrs</s>  clements replied in the greatest alarm and distress thatshe asked nothing better than to take anne safely to london but thatthere was no present hope of removing her from the dangerousneighbourhood as she lay ill in her bed at that moment</s>  the countinquired if mrs</s>  clements had sent for medical advice and hearing thatshe had hitherto hesitated to do so from the fear of making theirposition publicly known in the village informed her that he washimself a medical man and that he would go back with her if shepleased and see what could be done for anne</s>  mrs</s>  clements feeling anatural confidence in the count as a person trusted with a secretmessage from lady glyde gratefully accepted the offer and they wentback together to the cottage</s> anne was asleep when they got there</s>  the count started at the sight ofher evidently from astonishment at her resemblance to lady glyde</s> poor mrs</s>  clements supposed that he was only shocked to see how ill shewas</s>  he would not allow her to be awakenedhe was contented withputting questions to mrs</s>  clements about her symptoms with looking ather and with lightly touching her pulse</s>  sandon was a large enoughplace to have a grocers and druggists shop in it and thither thecount went to write his prescription and to get the medicine made up</s> he brought it back himself and told mrs</s>  clements that the medicinewas a powerful stimulant and that it would certainly give annestrength to get up and bear the fatigue of a journey to london of onlya few hours</s>  the remedy was to be administered at stated times on thatday and on the day after</s>  on the third day she would be well enough totravel and he arranged to meet mrs</s>  clements at the blackwaterstation and to see them off by the midday train</s>  if they did notappear he would assume that anne was worse and would proceed at onceto the cottage</s> as events turned out no such emergency as this occurred</s> this medicine had an extraordinary effect on anne and the good resultsof it were helped by the assurance mrs</s>  clements could now give herthat she would soon see lady glyde in london</s>  at the appointed day andtime when they had not been quite so long as a week in hampshirealtogether they arrived at the station</s>  the count was waiting therefor them and was talking to an elderly lady who appeared to be goingto travel by the train to london also</s>  he most kindly assisted themand put them into the carriage himself begging mrs</s>  clements not toforget to send her address to lady glyde</s>  the elderly lady did nottravel in the same compartment and they did not notice what became ofher on reaching the london terminus</s>  mrs</s>  clements secured respectablelodgings in a quiet neighbourhood and then wrote as she had engagedto do to inform lady glyde of the address</s> a little more than a fortnight passed and no answer came</s> at the end of that time a lady the same elderly lady whom they hadseen at the station called in a cab and said that she came from ladyglyde who was then at an hotel in london and who wished to see mrs</s> clements for the purpose of arranging a future interview with anne</s> mrs</s>  clements expressed her willingness anne being present at thetime and entreating her to do so to forward the object in viewespecially as she was not required to be away from the house for morethan half an hour at the most</s>  she and the elderly lady clearly madamefosco then left in the cab</s>  the lady stopped the cab after it haddriven some distance at a shop before they got to the hotel andbegged mrs</s>  clements to wait for her for a few minutes while she made apurchase that had been forgotten</s>  she never appeared again</s> after waiting some time mrs</s>  clements became alarmed and ordered thecabman to drive back to her lodgings</s>  when she got there after anabsence of rather more than half an hour anne was gone</s> the only information to be obtained from the people of the house wasderived from the servant who waited on the lodgers</s>  she had opened thedoor to a boy from the street who had left a letter for the youngwoman who lived on the second floor the part of the house which mrs</s> clements occupied</s>  the servant had delivered the letter had thengone downstairs and five minutes afterwards had observed anne open thefront door and go out dressed in her bonnet and shawl</s>  she hadprobably taken the letter with her for it was not to be found and itwas therefore impossible to tell what inducement had been offered tomake her leave the house</s>  it must have been a strong one for shewould never stir out alone in london of her own accord</s>  if mrs</s> clements had not known this by experience nothing would have inducedher to go away in the cab even for so short a time as half an houronly</s> as soon as she could collect her thoughts the first idea thatnaturally occurred to mrs</s>  clements was to go and make inquiries at theasylum to which she dreaded that anne had been taken back</s> she went there the next day having been informed of the locality inwhich the house was situated by anne herself</s>  the answer she receivedher application having in all probability been made a day or twobefore the false anne catherick had really been consigned to safekeeping in the asylum was that no such person had been brought backthere</s>  she had then written to mrs</s>  catherick at welmingham to know ifshe had seen or heard anything of her daughter and had received ananswer in the negative</s>  after that reply had reached her she was atthe end of her resources and perfectly ignorant where else to inquireor what else to do</s>  from that time to this she had remained in totalignorance of the cause of annes disappearance and of the end of annesstory</s> viithus far the information which i had received from mrs</s>  clementsthoughit established facts of which i had not previously beenawarewas of a preliminary character only</s> it was clear that the series of deceptions which had removed annecatherick to london and separated her from mrs</s>  clements had beenaccomplished solely by count fosco and the countess and the questionwhether any part of the conduct of husband or wife had been of a kindto place either of them within reach of the law might be well worthy offuture consideration</s>  but the purpose i had now in view led me inanother direction than this</s>  the immediate object of my visit to mrs</s> clements was to make some approach at least to the discovery of sirpercivals secret and she had said nothing as yet which advanced me onmy way to that important end</s>  i felt the necessity of trying to awakenher recollections of other times persons and events than those onwhich her memory had hitherto been employed and when i next spoke ispoke with that object indirectly in view</s> i wish i could be of any help to you in this sad calamity i said</s> all i can do is to feel heartily for your distress</s>  if anne had beenyour own child mrs</s>  clements you could have shown her no truerkindnessyou could have made no readier sacrifices for her sake</s> theres no great merit in that sir said mrs</s>  clements simply</s>  thepoor thing was as good as my own child to me</s>  i nursed her from ababy sir bringing her up by handand a hard job it was to rear her</s> it wouldnt go to my heart so to lose her if i hadnt made her firstshort clothes and taught her to walk</s>  i always said she was sent toconsole me for never having chick or child of my own</s>  and now sheslost the old times keep coming back to my mind and even at my age icant help crying about heri cant indeed sir</s> i waited a little to give mrs</s>  clements time to compose herself</s>  wasthe light that i had been looking for so long glimmering on mefaroff as yetin the good womans recollections of annes early life</s> did you know mrs</s>  catherick before anne was born</s>  i asked</s> not very long sirnot above four months</s>  we saw a great deal ofeach other in that time but we were never very friendly together</s> her voice was steadier as she made that reply</s>  painful as many of herrecollections might be i observed that it was unconsciously a reliefto her mind to revert to the dimlyseen troubles of the past afterdwelling so long on the vivid sorrows of the present</s> were you and mrs</s>  catherick neighbours</s>  i inquired leading hermemory on as encouragingly as i could</s> yes sirneighbours at old welmingham</s> old welmingham</s>  there are two places of that name then in hampshire</s> well sir there used to be in those daysbetter than threeandtwentyyears ago</s>  they built a new town about two miles off convenient to theriverand old welmingham which was never much more than a village gotin time to be deserted</s>  the new town is the place they call welminghamnowbut the old parish church is the parish church still</s>  it stands byitself with the houses pulled down or gone to ruin all round it</s>  ivelived to see sad changes</s>  it was a pleasant pretty place in my time</s> did you live there before your marriage mrs</s>  clements</s> no sirim a norfolk woman</s>  it wasnt the place my husband belongedto either</s>  he was from grimsby as i told you and he served hisapprenticeship there</s>  but having friends down south and hearing of anopening he got into business at southampton</s>  it was in a small waybut he made enough for a plain man to retire on and settled at oldwelmingham</s>  i went there with him when he married me</s>  we were neitherof us young but we lived very happy togetherhappier than ourneighbour mr</s>  catherick lived along with his wife when they came toold welmingham a year or two afterwards</s> was your husband acquainted with them before that</s> with catherick sirnot with his wife</s>  she was a stranger to both ofus</s>  some gentlemen had made interest for catherick and he got thesituation of clerk at welmingham church which was the reason of hiscoming to settle in our neighbourhood</s>  he brought his newlymarriedwife along with him and we heard in course of time she had beenladysmaid in a family that lived at varneck hall near southampton</s> catherick had found it a hard matter to get her to marry him inconsequence of her holding herself uncommonly high</s>  he had asked andasked and given the thing up at last seeing she was so contrary aboutit</s>  when he had given it up she turned contrary just the other wayand came to him of her own accord without rhyme or reason seemingly</s> my poor husband always said that was the time to have given her alesson</s>  but catherick was too fond of her to do anything of thesorthe never checked her either before they were married or after</s> he was a quick man in his feelings letting them carry him a deal toofar now in one way and now in another and he would have spoilt abetter wife than mrs</s>  catherick if a better had married him</s>  i dontlike to speak ill of any one sir but she was a heartless woman witha terrible will of her ownfond of foolish admiration and fineclothes and not caring to show so much as decent outward respect tocatherick kindly as he always treated her</s>  my husband said he thoughtthings would turn out badly when they first came to live near us andhis words proved true</s>  before they had been quite four months in ourneighbourhood there was a dreadful scandal and a miserable breakup intheir household</s>  both of them were in faulti am afraid both of themwere equally in fault</s>
you mean both husband and wife</s> oh no sir</s>  i dont mean catherickhe was only to be pitied</s>
 imeant his wife and the personand the person who caused the scandal</s> yes sir</s>  a gentleman born and brought up who ought to have set abetter example</s>  you know him sirand my poor dear anne knew him onlytoo well</s> sir percival glyde</s> yes sir percival glyde</s> my heart beat fasti thought i had my hand on the clue</s>  how little iknew then of the windings of the labyrinths which were still to misleadme</s> did sir percival live in your neighbourhood at that time</s>  i asked</s> no sir</s>  he came among us as a stranger</s>  his father had died notlong before in foreign parts</s>  i remember he was in mourning</s>  he put upat the little inn on the river they have pulled it down since thattime where gentlemen used to go to fish</s>  he wasnt much noticed whenhe first cameit was a common thing enough for gentlemen to travelfrom all parts of england to fish in our river</s> did he make his appearance in the village before anne was born</s> yes sir</s>  anne was born in the june month of eighteen hundred andtwentysevenand i think he came at the end of april or the beginningof may</s> came as a stranger to all of you</s>  a stranger to mrs</s>  catherick as wellas to the rest of the neighbours</s> so we thought at first sir</s>  but when the scandal broke out nobodybelieved they were strangers</s>  i remember how it happened as well as ifit was yesterday</s>  catherick came into our garden one night and wokeus by throwing up a handful of gravel from the walk at our window</s>  iheard him beg my husband for the lords sake to come down and speakto him</s>  they were a long time together talking in the porch</s>  when myhusband came back upstairs he was all of a tremble</s>  he sat down on theside of the bed and he says to me lizzie</s>  i always told you thatwoman was a bad onei always said she would end ill and im afraid inmy own mind that the end has come already</s>  catherick has found a lotof lace handkerchiefs and two fine rings and a new gold watch andchain hid away in his wifes drawerthings that nobody but a bornlady ought ever to haveand his wife wont say how she came by them</s> does he think she stole them</s>  says i</s>  no says he stealing wouldbe bad enough</s>  but its worse than that shes had no chance ofstealing such things as those and shes not a woman to take them ifshe had</s>  theyre gifts lizzietheres her own

about itivequieted catherick for tonight</s>  ive told him to keep his tongue tohimself and his eyes and his ears open and to wait a day or two tillhe can be quite certain</s>  i believe you are both of you wrong saysi</s>  its not in nature comfortable and respectable as she is herethat mrs</s>  catherick should take up with a chance stranger like sirpercival glyde</s>  ay but is he a stranger to her</s>  says my husband</s> you forget how cathericks wife came to marry him</s>  she went to him ofher own accord after saying no over and over again when he asked her</s> there have been wicked women before her time lizzie who have usedhonest men who loved them as a means of saving their characters andim sorely afraid this mrs</s>  catherick is as wicked as the worst ofthem</s>  we shall see says my husband we shall soon see</s>  and onlytwo days afterwards we did see</s> mrs</s>  clements waited for a moment before she went on</s>  even in thatmoment i began to doubt whether the clue that i thought i had foundwas really leading me to the central mystery of the labyrinth afterall</s>  was this common too common story of a mans treachery and awomans frailty the key to a secret which had been the lifelong terrorof sir percival glyde</s> well sir catherick took my husbands advice and waited mrs</s> clements continued</s>  and as i told you he hadnt long to wait</s>  on thesecond day he found his wife and sir percival whispering together quitefamiliar close under the vestry of the church</s>  i suppose they thoughtthe neighbourhood of the vestry was the last place in the world whereanybody would think of looking after them but however that may bethere they were</s>  sir percival being seemingly surprised andconfounded defended himself in such a guilty way that poor catherickwhose quick temper i have told you of already fell into a kind offrenzy at his own disgrace and struck sir percival</s>  he was no matchand i am sorry to say it for the man who had wronged him and he wasbeaten in the cruelest manner before the neighbours who had come tothe place on hearing the disturbance could run in to part them</s>  allthis happened towards evening and before nightfall when my husbandwent to cathericks house he was gone nobody knew where</s>  no livingsoul in the village ever saw him again</s>  he knew too well by thattime what his wifes vile reason had been for marrying him and hefelt his misery and disgrace especially after what had happened to himwith sir percival too keenly</s>  the clergyman of the parish put anadvertisement in the paper begging him to come back and saying that heshould not lose his situation or his friends</s>  but catherick had toomuch pride and spirit as some people saidtoo much feeling as ithink sirto face his neighbours again and try to live down thememory of his disgrace</s>  my husband heard from him when he had leftengland and heard a second time when he was settled and doing well inamerica</s>  he is alive there now as far as i know but none of us inthe old countryhis wicked wife least of allare ever likely to seteyes on him again</s> what became of sir percival</s>  i inquired</s>  did he stay in theneighbourhood</s> not he sir</s>  the place was too hot to hold him</s>  he was heard at highwords with mrs</s>  catherick the same night when the scandal broke outand the next morning he took himself off</s> and mrs</s>  catherick</s>  surely she never remained in the village among thepeople who knew of her disgrace</s> she did sir</s>  she was hard enough and heartless enough to set theopinions of all her neighbours at flat defiance</s>  she declared toeverybody from the clergyman downwards that she was the victim of adreadful mistake and that all the scandalmongers in the place shouldnot drive her out of it as if she was a guilty woman</s>  all through mytime she lived at old welmingham and after my time when the new townwas building and the respectable neighbours began moving to it shemoved too as if she was determined to live among them and scandalisethem to the very last</s>  there she is now and there she will stop indefiance of the best of them to her dying day</s> but how has she lived through all these years</s>  i asked</s>  was herhusband able and willing to help her</s> both able and willing sir said mrs</s>  clements</s>  in the secondletter he wrote to my good man he said she had borne his name andlived in his home and wicked as she was she must not starve like abeggar in the street</s>  he could afford to make her some smallallowance and she might draw for it quarterly at a place in london</s> did she accept the allowance</s> not a farthing of it sir</s>  she said she would never be beholden tocatherick for bit or drop if she lived to be a hundred</s>  and she haskept her word ever since</s>  when my poor dear husband died and left allto me cathericks letter was put in my possession with the otherthings and i told her to let me know if she was ever in want</s>  illlet all england know im in want she said before i tell catherickor any friend of cathericks</s>  take that for your answer and give itto him for an answer if he ever writes again</s> do you suppose that she had money of her own</s> very little if any sir</s>  it was said and said truly i am afraidthat her means of living came privately from sir percival glyde</s> after that last reply i waited a little to reconsider what i hadheard</s>  if i unreservedly accepted the story so far it was now plainthat no approach direct or indirect to the secret had yet beenrevealed to me and that the pursuit of my object had ended again inleaving me face to face with the most palpable and the mostdisheartening failure</s> but there was one point in the narrative which made me doubt thepropriety of accepting it unreservedly and which suggested the idea ofsomething hidden below the surface</s> i could not account to myself for the circumstance of the clerksguilty wife voluntarily living out all her afterexistence on the sceneof her disgrace</s>  the womans own reported statement that she had takenthis strange course as a practical assertion of her innocence did notsatisfy me</s>  it seemed to my mind more natural and more probable toassume that she was not so completely a free agent in this matter asshe had herself asserted</s>  in that case who was the likeliest personto possess the power of compelling her to remain at welmingham</s>  theperson unquestionably from whom she derived the means of living</s>  shehad refused assistance from her husband she had no adequate resourcesof her own she was a friendless degraded womanfrom what sourceshould she derive help but from the source at which report pointedsirpercival glyde</s> reasoning on these assumptions and always bearing in mind the onecertain fact to guide me that mrs</s>  catherick was in possession of thesecret i easily understood that it was sir percivals interest to keepher at welmingham because her character in that place was certain toisolate her from all communication with female neighbours and to allowher no opportunities of talking incautiously in moments of freeintercourse with inquisitive bosom friends</s>  but what was the mysteryto be concealed</s>  not sir percivals infamous connection with mrs</s> cathericks disgrace for the neighbours were the very people who knewof itnot the suspicion that he was annes father for welmingham wasthe place in which that suspicion must inevitably exist</s>  if i acceptedthe guilty appearances described to me as unreservedly as others hadaccepted them if i drew from them the same superficial conclusionwhich mr</s>  catherick and all his neighbours had drawn where was thesuggestion in all that i had heard of a dangerous secret between sirpercival and mrs</s>  catherick which had been kept hidden from that timeto this</s> and yet in those stolen meetings in those familiar whisperingsbetween the clerks wife and the gentleman in mourning the clue todiscovery existed beyond a doubt</s> was it possible that appearances in this case had pointed one way whilethe truth lay all the while unsuspected in another direction</s>  couldmrs</s>  cathericks assertion that she was the victim of a dreadfulmistake by any possibility be true</s>  or assuming it to be false couldthe conclusion which associated sir percival with her guilt have beenfounded in some inconceivable error</s>  had sir percival by any chancecourted the suspicion that was wrong for the sake of diverting fromhimself some other suspicion that was right</s>  hereif i could findithere was the approach to the secret hidden deep under the surfaceof the apparently unpromising story which i had just heard</s> my next questions were now directed to the one object of ascertainingwhether mr</s>  catherick had or had not arrived truly at the conviction ofhis wifes misconduct</s>  the answers i received from mrs</s>  clements leftme in no doubt whatever on that point</s>  mrs</s>  catherick had on theclearest evidence compromised her reputation while a single womanwith some person unknown and had married to save her character</s>  ithad been positively ascertained by calculations of time and place intowhich i need not enter particularly that the daughter who bore herhusbands name was not her husbands child</s> the next object of inquiry whether it was equally certain that sirpercival must have been the father of anne was beset by far greaterdifficulties</s>  i was in no position to try the probabilities on oneside or on the other in this instance by any better test than the testof personal resemblance</s> i suppose you often saw sir percival when he was in your village</s>  isaid</s> yes sir very often replied mrs</s>  clements</s> did you ever observe that anne was like him</s> she was not at all like him sir</s> was she like her mother then</s> not like her mother either sir</s>  mrs</s>  catherick was dark and full inthe face</s> not like her mother and not like her supposed father</s>  i knew thatthe test by personal resemblance was not to be implicitly trusted buton the other hand it was not to be altogether rejected on thataccount</s>  was it possible to strengthen the evidence by discovering anyconclusive facts in relation to the lives of mrs</s>  catherick and sirpercival before they either of them appeared at old welmingham</s>  when iasked my next questions i put them with this view</s> when sir percival first arrived in your neighbourhood i said didyou hear where he had come from last</s> no sir</s>  some said from blackwater park and some said fromscotlandbut nobody knew</s> was mrs</s>  catherick living in service at varneck hall immediatelybefore her marriage</s> yes sir</s> and had she been long in her place</s> three or four years sir i am not quite certain which</s> did you ever hear the name of the gentleman to whom varneck hallbelonged at that time</s> yes sir</s>  his name was major donthorne</s> did mr</s>  catherick or did any one else you knew ever hear that sirpercival was a friend of major donthornes or ever see sir percival inthe neighbourhood of varneck hall</s> catherick never did sir that i can remembernor any one elseeither that i know of</s> i noted down major donthornes name and address on the chance that hemight still be alive and that it might be useful at some future timeto apply to him</s>  meanwhile the impression on my mind was nowdecidedly adverse to the opinion that sir percival was annes fatherand decidedly favourable to the conclusion that the secret of hisstolen interviews with mrs</s>  catherick was entirely unconnected with thedisgrace which the woman had inflicted on her husbands good name</s>  icould think of no further inquiries which i might make to strengthenthis impressioni could only encourage mrs</s>  clements to speak next ofannes early days and watch for any chancesuggestion which might inthis way offer itself to me</s> i have not heard yet i said how the poor child born in all thissin and misery came to be trusted mrs</s>  clements to your care</s> there was nobody else sir to take the little helpless creature inhand replied mrs</s>  clements</s>  the wicked mother seemed to hate itasif the poor baby was in fault</s> from the day it was born</s>  my heart washeavy for the child and i made the offer to bring it up as tenderly asif it was my own</s> did anne remain entirely under your care from that time</s> not quite entirely sir</s>  mrs</s>  catherick had her whims and fanciesabout it at times and used now and then to lay claim to the child asif she wanted to spite me for bringing it up</s>  but these fits of hersnever lasted for long</s>  poor little anne was always returned to me andwas always glad to get backthough she led but a gloomy life in myhouse having no playmates like other children to brighten her up</s> our longest separation was when her mother took her to limmeridge</s> just at that time i lost my husband and i felt it was as well in thatmiserable affliction that anne should not be in the house</s>  she wasbetween ten and eleven years old then slow at her lessons poor souland not so cheerful as other childrenbut as pretty a little girl tolook at as you would wish to see</s>  i waited at home till her motherbrought her back and then i made the offer to take her with me tolondonthe truth being sir that i could not find it in my heart tostop at old welmingham after my husbands death the place was sochanged and so dismal to me</s> and did mrs</s>  catherick consent to your proposal</s> no sir</s>  she came back from the north harder and bitterer than ever</s> folks did say that she had been obliged to ask sir percivals leave togo to begin with and that she only went to nurse her dying sister atlimmeridge because the poor woman was reported to have saved moneythetruth being that she hardly left enough to bury her</s>  these things mayhave soured mrs</s>  catherick likely enough but however that may be shewouldnt hear of my taking the child away</s>  she seemed to likedistressing us both by parting us</s>  all i could do was to give anne mydirection and to tell her privately if she was ever in trouble tocome to me</s>  but years passed before she was free to come</s>  i never sawher again poor soul till the night she escaped from

was when i asked her</s>  all shecould tell me was that her mother might be the ruin and destruction ofsir percival if she chose</s>  mrs</s>  catherick may have let out just asmuch as that and no more</s>  im next to certain i should have heard thewhole truth from anne if she had really known it as she pretended todo and as she very likely fancied she did poor soul</s> this idea had more than once occurred to my own mind</s>  i had alreadytold marian that i doubted whether laura was really on the point ofmaking any important discovery when she and anne catherick weredisturbed by count fosco at the boathouse</s>  it was perfectly incharacter with annes mental affliction that she should assume anabsolute knowledge of the secret on no better grounds than vaguesuspicion derived from hints which her mother had incautiously letdrop in her presence</s>  sir percivals guilty distrust would in thatcase infallibly inspire him with the false idea that anne knew allfrom her mother just as it had afterwards fixed in his mind theequally false suspicion that his wife knew all from anne</s> the time was passing the morning was wearing away</s>  it was doubtfulif i stayed longer whether i should hear anything more from mrs</s> clements that would be at all useful to my purpose</s>  i had alreadydiscovered those local and family particulars in relation to mrs</s> catherick of which i

soundof a closing door behind me</s> i looked round and saw an undersized man in black on the doorstep ofa house which as well as i could judge stood next to mrs</s> cathericks place of abodenext to it on the side nearest to me</s>  theman did not hesitate a moment about the direction he should take</s>  headvanced rapidly towards the turning at which i had stopped</s>  irecognised him as the lawyers clerk who had preceded me in my visitto blackwater park and who had tried to pick a quarrel with me when iasked him if i could see the house</s> i waited where i was to ascertain whether his object was to come toclose quarters and speak on this occasion</s>  to my surprise he passed onrapidly without saying a word without even looking up in my face ashe went by</s>  this was such a complete inversion of the course ofproceeding which i had every reason to expect on his part that mycuriosity or rather my suspicion was aroused and i determined on myside to keep him cautiously in view and to discover what the businessmight be in which he was now employed</s>  without caring whether he saw meor not i walked after him</s>  he never looked back and he led mestraight through the streets to the railway station</s> the train was on the point of starting and two or three passengers whowere late were clustering round the small opening through which thetickets were issued</s>  i joined them and distinctly heard the lawyersclerk demand a ticket for the blackwater station</s>  i satisfied myselfthat he had actually left by the train before i came away</s> there was only one interpretation that i could place on what i had justseen and heard</s>  i had unquestionably observed the man leaving a housewhich closely adjoined mrs</s>  cathericks residence</s>  he had been probablyplaced there by sir percivals directions as a lodger inanticipation of my inquiries leading me sooner or later tocommunicate with mrs</s>  catherick</s>  he had doubtless seen me go in andcome out and he had hurried away by the first train to make his reportat blackwater park to which place sir percival would naturally betakehimself knowing what he evidently knew of my movements in order tobe ready on the spot if i returned to hampshire</s>  before many dayswere over there seemed every likelihood now that he and i might meet</s> whatever result events might be destined to produce i resolved topursue my own course straight to the end in view without stopping orturning aside for sir percival or for any one</s>  the greatresponsibility which weighed on me heavily in londontheresponsibility of so guiding my slightest actions as to prevent themfrom leading accidentally to the discovery of lauras place ofrefugewas removed now that i was in hampshire</s>  i could go and comeas i pleased at welmingham and if i chanced to fail in observing anynecessary precautions the immediate results at least would affect noone but myself</s> when i left the station the winter evening was beginning to close in</s> there was little hope of continuing my inquiries after dark to anyuseful purpose in a neighbourhood that was strange to me</s>  accordinglyi made my way to the nearest hotel and ordered my dinner and my bed</s> this done i wrote to marian to tell her that i was safe and well andthat i had fair prospects of success</s>  i had directed her on leavinghome to address the first letter she wrote to me the letter iexpected to receive the next morning to the postoffice welminghamand i now begged her to send her second days letter to the sameaddress</s> i could easily receive it by writing to the postmaster if i happened tobe away from the town when it arrived</s> the coffeeroom of the hotel as it grew late in the evening became aperfect solitude</s>  i was left to reflect on what i had accomplishedthat afternoon as uninterruptedly as if the house had been my own</s> before i retired to rest i had attentively thought over myextraordinary interview with mrs</s>  catherick from beginning to end andhad verified at my leisure the conclusions which i had hastily drawn inthe earlier part of the day</s> the vestry of old welmingham church was the startingpoint from whichmy mind slowly worked its way back through all that i had heard mrs</s> catherick say and through all i had seen mrs</s>  catherick do</s> at the time when the neighbourhood of the vestry was first referred toin my presence by mrs</s>  clements i had thought it the strangest andmost unaccountable of all places for sir percival to select for aclandestine meeting with the clerks wife</s>  influenced by thisimpression and by no other i had mentioned the vestry of the churchbefore mrs</s>  catherick on pure speculationit represented one of theminor peculiarities of the story which occurred to me while i wasspeaking</s>  i was prepared for her answering me confusedly or angrilybut the blank terror that seized her when i said the words took mecompletely by surprise</s>  i had long before associated sir percivalssecret with the concealment of a serious crime which mrs</s>  catherickknew of but i had gone no further than this</s>  now the womans paroxysmof terror associated the crime either directly or indirectly with thevestry and convinced me that she had been more than the mere witnessof itshe was also the accomplice beyond a doubt</s> what had been the nature of the crime</s>  surely there was a contemptibleside to it as well as a dangerous side or mrs</s>  catherick would nothave repeated my own words referring to sir percivals rank and powerwith such marked disdain as she had certainly displayed</s>  it was acontemptible crime then and a dangerous crime and she had shared init and it was associated with the vestry of the church</s> the next consideration to be disposed of led me a step farther fromthis point</s> mrs</s>  cathericks undisguised contempt for sir percival plainly extendedto his mother as well</s>  she had referred with the bitterest sarcasm tothe great family he had descended fromespecially by the mothersside</s>  what did this mean</s> there appeared to be only two explanations of it</s>  either his mothersbirth had been low or his mothers reputation was damaged by somehidden flaw with which mrs</s>  catherick and sir percival were bothprivately acquainted</s>  i could only put the first explanation to thetest by looking at the register of her marriage and so ascertainingher maiden name and her parentage as a preliminary to further inquiries</s> on the other hand if the second case supposed were the true one whathad been the flaw in her reputation</s>  remembering the account whichmarian had given me of sir percivals father and mother and of thesuspiciously unsocial secluded life they had both led i now askedmyself whether it might not be possible that his mother had never beenmarried at all</s>  here again the register might by offering writtenevidence of the marriage prove to me at any rate that this doubt hadno foundation in truth</s>  but where was the register to be found</s>  atthis point i took up the conclusions which i had previously formed andthe same mental process which had discovered the locality of theconcealed crime now lodged the register also in the vestry of oldwelmingham church</s> these were the results of my interview with mrs</s>  catherickthese werethe various considerations all steadily converging to one point whichdecided the course of my proceedings on the next day</s> the morning was cloudy and lowering but no rain

built out from the church andseemed to be of the same age</s>  round the building at intervals appearedthe remains of the village which mrs</s>  clements had described to me asher husbands place of

time and some were still inhabited by personsevidently of the poorest class</s>  it was a dreary scene and yet in theworst aspect of its ruin not so dreary as the modern town that i hadjust left</s>  here there was the brown breezy sweep of surroundingfields for the eye to repose onhere the trees leafless as they werestill varied the monotony of the prospect and helped the mind to lookforward to summertime and shade</s> as i moved away from the back of the church and passed some of thedismantled cottages in search of a person who might direct me to theclerk i saw two men saunter out after me from behind a wall</s>  thetallest of the twoa stout muscular man in the dress of agamekeeperwas a stranger to me</s>  the other was one of the men who hadfollowed me in london on the day when i left mr</s>  kyrles office</s>  i hadtaken particular notice of him at the time and i felt sure that i wasnot mistaken in identifying the fellow on this occasion</s> neither he nor his companion attempted to speak to me and both keptthemselves at a respectful distance but the motive of their presencein the neighbourhood of the church was plainly apparent</s>  it was exactlyas i had supposedsir percival

on away from the church till i reached one of the inhabitedhouses with a patch of kitchen garden attached to it on which alabourer was at work</s>  he directed me to the clerks abode a cottageat some little distance off standing by itself on the outskirts of theforsaken village</s>  the clerk was indoors and was just putting on hisgreatcoat</s>  he was a cheerful familiar loudlytalkative old man witha very poor opinion as i soon discovered of the place in which helived and a happy sense of superiority to his neighbours in virtue ofthe great personal distinction of having once been in

yielded andhe opened the door</s> the vestry was larger than i should have supposed it to be judgingfrom the outside only</s>  it was a dim mouldy melancholy old room witha low raftered ceiling</s>  round two sides of it the sides nearest tothe interior of the church ran heavy wooden presses wormeaten andgaping with age</s>  hooked to the inner corner of one of these presseshung several surplices

and mouldy being rendered additionally oppressive bythe closing of the door which led into the church</s>  this door also wascomposed of solid oak and was bolted at the top and bottom on thevestry

surplices were hangingand produced a large volume bound ingreasy brown leather</s>  i was struck by the insecurity of the place inwhich the register was kept</s>  the door of the press was warped

the road with a sharp turn atsome distance ahead and had just concluded calculating by time thati must be getting near to the town when i suddenly heard the steps ofthe men close behind me</s> before

godruled it that he and i should meet</s> xithe inquest was hurried for certain local reasons which weighed withthe coroner and the town authorities</s>  it was held on the afternoon ofthe next day</s>
 i was necessarily one among the witnesses summoned toassist the objects of the investigation</s> my first proceeding in the morning was to go to the postoffice andinquire for the letter which i expected from marian</s>  no change ofcircumstances however extraordinary could affect the one greatanxiety which weighed on my mind while i was away from london</s>  themornings letter which was the only assurance i could receive that nomisfortune had happened in my absence was still the absorbing interestwith which my day began</s> to my relief the letter from marian was at the office waiting for me</s> nothing had happenedthey were both as safe and as well as when i hadleft them</s>  laura sent her love and begged that i would let her knowof my return a day beforehand</s>  her sister added in explanation ofthis message that she had saved nearly a sovereign out of her ownprivate purse and that she had claimed the privilege of ordering thedinner and giving the dinner which was to celebrate the day of myreturn</s>  i read these little domestic confidences in the bright morningwith the terrible recollection of what had happened the evening beforevivid in my memory</s>  the necessity of sparing laura any suddenknowledge of the truth was the first consideration which the lettersuggested to me</s>  i wrote at once to marian to tell her what i havetold in these pagespresenting the tidings as gradually and gently asi could and warning her not to let any such thing as a newspaper fallin lauras way while i was absent</s>  in the case of any other womanless courageous and less reliable i might have hesitated before iventured on unreservedly disclosing the whole truth</s>  but i owed it tomarian to be faithful to my past experience of her and to trust her asi trusted herself</s> my letter was necessarily a long one</s>  it occupied me until the timecame for proceeding to the inquest</s> the objects of the legal inquiry were necessarily beset by peculiarcomplications and difficulties</s>  besides the investigation into themanner in which the deceased had met his death there were seriousquestions to be settled relating to the cause of the fire to theabstraction of the keys and to the presence of a stranger in thevestry at the time when the flames broke out</s>  even the identificationof the dead man had not yet been accomplished</s>  the helpless conditionof the servant had made the police distrustful of his assertedrecognition of his master</s>  they had sent to knowlesbury overnight tosecure the attendance of witnesses who were well acquainted with thepersonal appearance of sir percival glyde and they had communicatedthe first thing in the morning with blackwater park</s>  theseprecautions enabled the coroner and jury to settle the question ofidentity and to confirm the correctness of the servants assertionthe evidence offered by competent witnesses and by the discovery ofcertain facts being subsequently strengthened by an examination of thedead mans watch</s>  the crest and the name of sir percival glyde wereengraved inside it</s> the next inquiries related to the fire</s> the servant and i and the boy who had heard the light struck in thevestry were the first witnesses called</s>  the boy gave his evidenceclearly enough but the servants mind had not yet recovered the shockinflicted on ithe was plainly incapable of assisting the objects ofthe inquiry and he was desired to stand down</s> to my own relief my examination was not a long one</s>  i had not knownthe deceasedi had never seen himi was not aware of his presence atold welminghamand i had not been in the vestry at the finding of thebody</s>  all i could prove was that i had stopped at the clerks cottageto ask my waythat i had heard from him of the loss of the keysthati had accompanied him to the church to render what help i couldthat ihad seen the firethat i had heard some person unknown inside thevestry trying vainly to unlock the doorand that i had done what icould from motives of humanity to save the man</s>  other witnesses whohad been acquainted with the deceased were asked if they could explainthe mystery of his presumed abstraction of the keys and his presencein the burning room</s>  but the coroner seemed to take it for grantednaturally enough that i as a total stranger in the neighbourhood anda total stranger to sir percival glyde could not be in a position tooffer any evidence on these two points</s> the course that i was myself bound to take when my formal examinationhad closed seemed clear to me</s>  i did not feel called on to volunteerany statement of my own private convictions in the first placebecause my doing so could serve no practical purpose now that allproof in support of any surmises of mine was burnt with the burntregister in the second place because i could not have intelligiblystated my opinionmy unsupported opinionwithout disclosing the wholestory of the conspiracy and producing beyond a doubt the sameunsatisfactory effect an the minds of the coroner and the jury which ihad already produced on the mind of mr</s>  kyrle</s> in these pages however and after the time that has now elapsed nosuch cautions and restraints as are here described need fetter the freeexpression of my opinion</s>  i will state briefly before my pen occupiesitself with other events how my own convictions lead me to account forthe abstraction of the keys for the outbreak of the fire and for thedeath of the man</s> the news of my being free on bail drove sir percival as i believe tohis last resources</s>  the attempted attack on the road was one of thoseresources and the suppression of all practical proof of his crime bydestroying the page of the register on which the forgery had beencommitted was the other and the surest of the two</s>  if i couldproduce no extract from the original book to compare with the certifiedcopy at knowlesbury i could produce no positive evidence and couldthreaten him with no fatal exposure</s>  all that was necessary to theattainment of his end was that he should get into the vestryunperceived that he should tear out the page in the register and thathe should leave the vestry again as privately as he had entered it</s> on this supposition it is easy to understand why he waited untilnightfall before he made the attempt and why he took advantage of theclerks absence to possess himself of the keys</s>  necessity would obligehim to strike a light to find his way to the right register and commoncaution would suggest his locking the door on the inside in case ofintrusion on the part of any inquisitive stranger or on my part if ihappened to be in the neighbourhood at the time</s> i cannot believe that it was any part of his intention to make thedestruction of the register appear to be the result of accident bypurposely setting the vestry on fire</s>  the bare chance that promptassistance might arrive and that the books might by the remotestpossibility be saved would have been enough on a momentsconsideration to dismiss any idea of this sort from his mind</s> remembering the quantity of combustible objects in the vestrythestraw the papers the packingcases the dry wood the old wormeatenpressesall the probabilities in my estimation point to the fire asthe result of an accident with his matches or his light</s> his first impulse under these circumstances was doubtless to try toextinguish the flames and failing in that his second impulseignorant as he was of the state of the lock had been to attempt toescape by the door which had given him entrance</s>  when i had called tohim the flames must have reached across the door leading into thechurch on either side of which the presses extended and close towhich the other combustible objects were placed</s>  in all probabilitythe smoke and flame confined as they were to the room had been toomuch for him when he tried to escape by the inner door</s>  he must havedropped in his deathswoonhe must have sunk in the place where he wasfoundjust as i got on the roof to break the skylight window</s>  even ifwe had been able afterwards to get into the church and to burst openthe door from that side the delay must have been fatal</s>  he would havebeen past saving long past saving by that time</s>  we should only havegiven the flames free ingress into the churchthe church which wasnow preserved but which in that event would have shared the fate ofthe vestry</s>  there is no doubt in my mind there can be no doubt in themind of any one that he was a dead man before ever we got to the emptycottage and worked with might and main to tear down the beam</s> this is the nearest approach that any theory of mine can make towardsaccounting for a result which was visible matter of fact</s>  as i havedescribed them so events passed to us outside</s>  as i have related itso his body was found</s> the inquest was adjourned over one dayno explanation that the eye ofthe law could recognise having been discovered thus far to account forthe mysterious circumstances of the case</s> it was arranged that more witnesses should be summoned and that thelondon solicitor of the deceased should be invited to attend</s>  a medicalman was also charged with the duty of reporting on the mental conditionof the servant which appeared at present to debar him from giving anyevidence of the least importance</s>  he could only declare in a dazedway that he had been ordered on the night of the fire to wait in thelane and that he knew nothing else except that the deceased wascertainly his master</s> my own impression was that he had been first used without any guiltyknowledge on his own part to ascertain the fact of the clerks absencefrom home on the previous day and that he had been afterwards orderedto wait near the church but out of sight of the vestry to assist hismaster in the event of my escaping the attack on the road and of acollision occurring between sir percival and myself</s>  it is necessaryto add that the mans own testimony was never obtained to confirm thisview</s>  the medical report of him declared that what little mentalfaculty he possessed was seriously shaken nothing satisfactory wasextracted from him at the adjourned inquest and for aught i know tothe contrary he may never have recovered to this day</s> i returned to the hotel at welmingham so jaded in body and mind soweakened and depressed by all that i had gone through as to be quiteunfit to endure the local gossip about the inquest and to answer thetrivial questions that the talkers addressed to me in the coffeeroom</s> i withdrew from my scanty dinner to my cheap garretchamber to securemyself a little quiet and to think undisturbed of laura and marian</s> if i had

to say him nay</s>  his father and mother had always livedas man and wifenone of the few people who were acquainted with themever supposed them to be anything else</s>  the right person to claim theproperty if the truth had been known was a distant relation who hadno idea of ever getting it and who was away at sea when his fatherdied</s>  he had no difficulty so farhe took possession as a matter ofcourse</s>  but he could not borrow money on the property as a matter ofcourse</s>  there were two things wanted of him before he could do this</s> one was a certificate of his birth and the other was a certificate ofhis parents marriage</s>  the certificate of his birth was easily gothewas born abroad and the certificate was there in due form</s>  the othermatter was a difficulty and that difficulty brought him to oldwelmingham</s> but for one consideration he might have gone to knowlesbury instead</s> his mother had been living there just before she met with hisfatherliving under her maiden name the truth being that she wasreally a married woman married in ireland where her husband hadillused her and had afterwards gone off with some other person</s>  igive you this fact on good authoritysir felix mentioned it to his sonas the reason why he had not married</s>  you may wonder why the sonknowing that his parents had met each other at knowlesbury did notplay his first tricks with the register of that church where it mighthave been fairly presumed his father and mother were married</s>  thereason was that the clergyman who did duty at knowlesbury church inthe year eighteen hundred and three when according to his birthcertificate his father and mother ought to have been married wasalive still when he took possession of the property in the new year ofeighteen hundred and twentyseven</s>  this awkward circumstance forcedhim to extend his inquiries to our neighbourhood</s>  there no such dangerexisted the former clergyman at our church having been dead for someyears</s> old welmingham suited his purpose as well as knowlesbury</s>  his fatherhad removed his mother from knowlesbury and had lived with her at acottage on the river a little distance from our village</s>  people whohad known his solitary ways when he was single did not wonder at hissolitary ways when he was supposed to be married</s>  if he had not been ahideous creature to look at his retired life with the lady might haveraised suspicions but as things were his hiding his ugliness and hisdeformity in the strictest privacy surprised nobody</s>  he lived in ourneighbourhood till he came in possession of the park</s>  after three orfour and twenty years had passed who was to say the clergyman beingdead that his marriage had not been as private as the rest of hislife and that it had not taken place at old welmingham church</s> so as i told you the son found our neighbourhood the surest place hecould choose to set things right secretly in his own interests</s>  it maysurprise you to hear that what he really did to the marriage registerwas done on the spur of the momentdone on second thoughts</s> his first notion was only to tear the leaf out in the right year andmonth to destroy it privately to go back to london and to tell thelawyers to get him the necessary certificate of his fathers marriageinnocently referring them of course to the date on the leaf that wasgone</s>  nobody could say his father and mother had not been marriedafter that and whether under the circumstances they would stretch apoint or not about lending him the money he thought they would hehad his answer ready at all events if a question was ever raised abouthis right to the name and the estate</s> but when he came to look privately at the register for himself hefound at the bottom of one of the pages for the year eighteen hundredand three a blank space left seemingly through there being no room tomake a long entry there which was made instead at the top of the nextpage</s>  the sight of this chance altered all his plans</s>  it was anopportunity he had never hoped for or thought ofand he took ityouknow how</s>  the blank space to have exactly tallied with his birthcertificate ought to have occurred in the july part of the register</s> it occurred in the september part instead</s>  however in this case ifsuspicious questions were asked the answer was not hard to find</s>  hehad only to describe himself as a seven months child</s> i was fool enough when he told me his story to feel some interest andsome pity for himwhich was just what he calculated on as you willsee</s>  i thought him hardly used</s>  it was not his fault that his fatherand mother were not married and it was not his fathers and mothersfault either</s>  a more scrupulous woman than i wasa woman who had notset her heart on a gold watch and chainwould have found some excusesfor him</s>  at all events i held my tongue and helped to screen what hewas about</s> he was some time getting the ink the right colour mixing it over andover again in pots and bottles of mine and some time afterwards inpractising the handwriting</s>  but he succeeded in the end and made anhonest woman of his mother after she was dead in her grave</s>  so far idont deny that he behaved honourably enough to myself</s>  he gave me mywatch and chain and spared no expense in buying them both were ofsuperior workmanship and very expensive</s>  i have got them stillthewatch goes beautifully</s> you said the other day that mrs</s>  clements had told you everything sheknew</s>  in that case there is no need for me to write about the trumperyscandal by which i was the suffererthe innocent sufferer ipositively assert</s>  you must know as well as i do what the notion waswhich my husband took into his head when he found me and myfinegentleman acquaintance meeting each other privately and talkingsecrets together</s>  but what you dont know is how it ended between thatsame gentleman and

falsehoodbecauseas long as they did so they were quite certain never to suspect thetruth</s>  i had a spirit of my own and i told him they should know thetruth from my lips</s>  his reply was short and to the point</s>  if ispoke i was a lost woman as certainly as he was a lost man</s> yes</s>  it had come to that</s>  he had deceived me about the risk i ran inhelping him</s>  he had practised on my ignorance he had tempted me withhis gifts he had interested me with his storyand the result of itwas that he made me his accomplice</s>  he owned this coolly and he endedby telling me for the first time what the frightful punishment reallywas for his offence and for any one who helped him to commit it</s>  inthose days the law was not so tenderhearted as i hear it is now</s> murderers were

right</s>  i told him that she had merely repeatedlike a parrot the words she had heard me say and that she knew noparticulars whatever because i had mentioned none</s>  i explained thatshe had

to burdenthese pages with any statement of what passed at the interview</s>  itwill be more to the purpose to say that the interview itselfnecessarily brought to my mind the one doubtful question

strikingly important whenmassed togetherhad latterly led my mind to a conclusion which iresolved to verify</s>  i obtained marians permission to write to majordonthorne of varneck hall where mrs</s>  catherick had lived in servicefor some years previous to her marriage to ask him certain questions</s> i made the inquiries in marians name and described them as relatingto matters of personal history

him and the nature of my inquirieswill be easily inferred from his reply</s>  his letter answered myquestions by communicating these important factsin the first place the late sir percival glyde of blackwater parkhad never set foot in varneck hall</s>  the deceased gentleman was a totalstranger to major donthorne and to all his family</s> in the second place the late mr</s>  philip fairlie of limmeridgehouse had been in his younger days the intimate friend and constantguest of major donthorne</s>  having refreshed his memory by looking backto old letters and other papers the major was in a

the few particulars which she had discoveredrelating to him</s> the passage to which i allude occurs in that part of her journal whichdelineates his character and his personal appearance</s>  she describeshim as not having crossed the frontiers of his native country foryears pastas anxious to know if any italian gentlemen were settledin the nearest town to blackwater parkas receiving letters with allsorts of odd stamps on them and one with a large officiallooking sealon it</s>  she is inclined to consider that his long absence from hisnative country may be accounted for by assuming that he is a politicalexile</s>  but she is on the other hand unable to reconcile this ideawith the reception of the letter from abroad bearing the largeofficiallooking sealletters from the continent addressed topolitical exiles being usually the last to court attention from foreignpostoffices in that way</s> the considerations thus presented to me in the diary joined to certainsurmises of my own

listening at the doorthe count is a spy</s> laura had applied the word to him at hazard in natural anger at hisproceedings towards herself</s>  i applied it to him with the deliberateconviction that his vocation in life was the vocation of a spy</s>  onthis assumption the reason for his extraordinary stay in england solong after the objects of the conspiracy had been gained became to mymind quite

that a countryman ofhis own on whom i could rely might be the fittest person to help me</s> the first man whom i thought of under these circumstances was also theonly italian with whom i was
