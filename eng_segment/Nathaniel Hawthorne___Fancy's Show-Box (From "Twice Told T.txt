 but mr</s> smith had a shrewd idea that it was conscience</s> how kind of fancy memory and conscience to visit the old gentlemanjust as he was beginning to imagine that the wine had neither so bright asparkle nor so excellent a flavor as when himself and the liquor wereless aged</s>  through the dim length of the apartment where crimsoncurtains muffled the glare of sunshine and created a rich obscurity thethree guests drew near the silverhaired old mail</s>
conscience with her face still hidden in the dusky mantle took herstation on the left so as to be next his heart while fancy set down herpicturebox upon the table with the magnifyingglass convenient to hiseye</s>  we can sketch merely the outlines of two or three out of the manypictures which at the pulling of a string successively peopled the boxwith the semblances of living scenes</s> one was a moonlight picture in the background a lowly dwelling and infront partly shadowed by a tree yet besprinkled with flakes ofradiance two youthful figures male and female</s>  the young man stoodwith folded arms a haughty smile upon his lip and a gleam of triumph inhis eye as he glanced downward at the kneeling girl</s>  she was almostprostrate at his feet evidently sinking under a weight of shame andanguish which hardly allowed her to lift her clasped hands insupplication</s>  her eyes she could not lift</s>  but neither her agony northe lovely features on which it was depicted nor the slender grace ofthe form which it convulsed appeared to soften the obduracy of the youngman</s>  he was the personification of triumphant scorn</s>  now strange tosay as old mr</s>  smith peeped through the magnifyingglass which made theobjects start out from the canvas with magical deception he began torecognize the farmhouse the tree and both the figures of the picture</s>

 she reads it close to the oldgentlemans ear it is a record merely of sinful thought which never wasembodied in an act but while memory is reading conscience unveils herface and strikes a dagger to the heart of mr</s>  smith</s>  though not adeathblow the torture was extreme</s> the exhibition proceeded</s>  one after another fancy displayed herpictures all of which appeared to have been painted by some maliciousartist on purpose to vex mr</s>  smith</s>  not a shadow of proof could havebeen adduced in any earthly court that he was guilty of the slightestof those sins which were thus made to stare him in the face</s>  in onescene there was a table set out with several bottles and glasses halffilled with wine which threw back the dull ray of an expiring lamp</s> there had been mirth and revelry until the hand of the clock stood justat midnight when murder stepped between the boon companions</s>
 a youngman had fallen on the floor and lay stone dead with a ghastly woundcrushed into his temple while over him with a delirium of mingled rageand horror in his countenance stood the youthful likeness of mr</s>  smith</s> the murdered youth wore the features of edward spencer</s>

some of the pictures had been painted with so doubtful a touch and incolors so faint and pale that the subjects could barely be conjectured</s> a dull semitransparent mist had been thrown over the surface of thecanvas into which the figures seemed to vanish while the eye soughtmost earnestly to fix them</s>  but in every scene however dubiouslyportrayed mr</s>  smith was invariably haunted by his own lineaments atvarious ages as in a dusty mirror</s>  after poring several minutes overone of these blurred and almost indistinguishable pictures he began tosee that the painter had intended to represent him now in the decline oflife as stripping the clothes from the backs of three halfstarvedchildren</s>  really this puzzles me</s>  quoth mr</s>  smith with the irony ofconscious rectitude</s>  asking pardon of the painter i pronounce him afool as well as a scandalous knave</s>  a man of my standing in the worldto be robbing little children of their clothes</s>  ridiculous</s>
 it was not altogetherinapplicable to the misty scene</s>  it told how mr</s>  smith had beengrievously tempted by many devilish sophistries on the ground of alegal quibble to commence a lawsuit against three orphan children jointheirs to a considerable estate</s>  fortunately before he was quitedecided his claims had turned out nearly as devoid of law as justice</s> as memory ceased to read conscience again thrust aside her mantle andwould have struck her victim with the envenomed dagger only that hestruggled and clasped his hands before his heart</s>  even then howeverhe sustained an ugly gash</s> why should we follow fancy through the whole series of those awfulpictures</s>  painted by an artist of wondrous power and terribleacquaintance with the secret soul they embodied the ghosts of all thenever perpetrated sins that had glided through the lifetime of mr</s>  smith</s> and could such beings of cloudy fantasy so near akin to nothingnessgive valid evidence against him at the day of judgment</s>
