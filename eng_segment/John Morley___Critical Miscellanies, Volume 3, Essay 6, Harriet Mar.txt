allowed to blur judgment nor moral disapproval to narrow starveand discolour vision into lost possibilities of character</s>  and we maynote in passing how even here in the mere story of the men and womenwhom she met in london drawingrooms harriet martineau does not loseherself in gossip about individuals looked at merely in their individualrelations</s>  it is not merely the blighting of promise nor the forfeitureof a career that she deplores in the case of a bulwer or a brougham itis the intercepting of national blessings</s>  if this view of naturalgifts as a source of blessing to society and not merely of power orfame to their privileged possessor were more common than it is theimpression which such a thought is calculated to make would be thehighest available protection against those blighted promises andforfeited careers of which brougham and bulwer were only two out of atoo vast host of examples</s> it is the very fulness with which she is possessed by this large way ofconceiving a life in its manifold relations to the service of the worldthat is the secret of harriet martineaus firm clear calm and almostneutral way of judging both her own work and character and those ofothers</s>  by calm we do not mean that she was incapable of strong anddirect censure</s>  many of her judgments both here and in her biographicsketches are stern and somelike that on macaulay

were at least as strong inharriet martineau as in anybody then living the whigs were soon felt tohave cheated</s>  she cannot forgive them</s>  speaking of john and edwardromilly they had virtuous projects she says and had every hope ofachieving service worthy of their fathers fame but their aspirationswere speedily tamed downas all high aspirations are lowered by whiginfluences</s>  a certain

whigs</s> but the poverty and perverseness of their ideas and the insolence oftheir feelings were precisely what might be expected by all who reallyknew that remarkably vulgar class of men</s>  they

and genial tone ofaddress in the new publication while trying to push in as contributorseffete and exhausted writers and friends of their own who knew aboutas much of the working classes of england as

 the workmen have acquired direct political powerthey have organised themselves into effective groups for industrialpurposes they have produced leaders of ability and sound judgment andthe whig who seeks their support must stoop or rise to talk a radicalismthat would have amply satisfied even harriet martineau herself</s> the source of this improvement in the society to which she badefarewell

thegreatest mannerist of his age while denouncing conventionalismthegreatest talker while eulogising silencethe most woful complainerwhile glorifying fortitudethe most uncertain and stormy in mood

from sartor resartus tothe tracts for the times yet they were both of them protests againstthe same thing both of them attempted answers to the same problem andthe tracts perhaps did more than sartor to quicken spiritual lifeto shatter the clapham church and to substitute a mystic faith andnot unlovely hope for the frigid hard and mechanical lines of officialorthodoxy on the one hand and the egotism and sentimental despair ofbyronism on the other</s>  there is a third school too and harrietmartineau herself was no insignificant member of it to which both thetemper and the political morality of our time have owed a deep debt theschool of those utilitarian political thinkers who gave light ratherthan heat and yet by the intellectual force with which they insisted onthe right direction of social reform also stirred the very impulsewhich made men desire social reform</s>  the most illustrious of this bodywas undoubtedly john mill because to accurate political science headded a fervid and vibrating social sympathy and a power of quickeningit in the best minds of a scientific turn</s>  it is odd by the way thatmiss martineau while so lavish in deserved panegyric on carlyleshould be so grudging and disparaging in the case of mill with whom herintellectual affinities must have been closer than with any other of hercontemporaries</s>  the translator of comtes positive philosophy hadbetter reasons than most people for thinking well of the services of theauthor of the system of logic it was certainly the latter book whichdid more than any other to prepare the minds of the english philosophicpublic for the former</s> it is creditable to miss martineaus breadth of sympathy that she shouldhave left on record the tribute of her admiration for carlyle fornobody has written so harshly as carlyle on the subject which interestedharriet martineau more passionately than any other events of her time</s> in 1834 she had finished her series of illustrations of politicaleconomy her domestic life was fretted by the unreasonable exigences ofher mother london society had perhaps begun to weary her and she feltthe need of a change of scene</s>  the united states with the old europeaninstitutions placed amid new conditions were then as now a naturalobject of interest to everybody with a keen feeling for socialimprovement</s>  so to the western republic miss martineau turned her face</s> she had not been long in the states before she began to feel that theabolitionists at that moment a despised and persecuted handful of menand women were the truly moral and regenerating party in the country</s> harriet martineau no sooner felt this conviction driving out her formerprejudice against them as fanatical and impracticable than she at oncebore public testimony at serious risk of every kind to herself infavour of the extreme antislavery agitators</s>  and for thirty years shenever slackened her sympathy nor her energetic action on english publicopinion in this most vital matter of her time</s>  she was guided notmerely by humanitarian disgust at the cruel and brutal abominations ofslaverythough we know no reason why this alone should not be asufficient ground for turning abolitionistbut also on the more purelypolitical ground of the cowardice silence corruption and hypocrisythat were engendered in the free states by purchased connivance at thepeculiar institution of the slave states</s>  nobody has yet traced out thefull effect upon the national character of the americans of all thoseyears of conscious complicity in slavery after the moral iniquity ofslavery had become clear to the inner conscience of the very men whoignobly sanctioned the mobbing of abolitionists</s> in the summer of 1836 miss martineau returned to england having addedthis great question to the stock of her foremost objects of interest andconcern</s>  such additions whether literary or social are the best kindof refreshment that travel supplies</s>  she published two books on americaone of them abstract and quasiscientific society in america theother a retrospect of western travel of a lighter and more purelydescriptive

 their onlyservice and it was not inconsiderable was the information which theycirculated as to the condition of slavery and of the country under it</s> we do not suppose that they are worth reading at the present day exceptfrom a historical point of view</s>  but they are really good specimens of akind of literature which is not abundant and yet which is of the utmostvaluewe mean the record of the sociological observation of a countryby a competent traveller who stays long enough in the country hasaccess to the right persons of all kinds and will take pains enough tomature his judgments</s>
