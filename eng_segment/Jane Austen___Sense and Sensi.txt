sense and sensibilityby jane austen1811chapter 1the family of dashwood had long been settled in sussex</s>  their estatewas large and their residence was at norland park in the centre oftheir property where for many generations they had lived in sorespectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of theirsurrounding acquaintance</s>  the late owner of this estate was a singleman who lived to a very advanced age and who for many years of hislife had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister</s>  but herdeath which happened ten years before his own produced a greatalteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and receivedinto his house the family of his nephew mr</s>  henry dashwood the legalinheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended tobequeath it</s>  in the society of his nephew and niece and theirchildren the old gentlemans days were comfortably spent</s>  hisattachment to them all increased</s>  the constant attention of mr</s>  andmrs</s>  henry dashwood to his wishes which proceeded not merely frominterest but from goodness of heart gave him every degree of solidcomfort which his age could receive and the cheerfulness of thechildren added a relish to his existence</s> by a former marriage mr</s>  henry dashwood had one son by his presentlady three daughters</s>  the son a steady respectable young man wasamply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been largeand half of which devolved on him on his coming of age</s>  by his ownmarriage likewise which happened soon afterwards he added to hiswealth</s>  to him therefore the succession to the norland estate was notso really important as to his sisters for their fortune independentof what might arise to them from their fathers inheriting thatproperty could be but small</s>  their mother had nothing and theirfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for theremaining moiety of his first wifes fortune was also secured to herchild and he had only a lifeinterest in it</s> the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every otherwill gave as much disappointment as pleasure</s>  he was neither sounjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephewbuthe left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of thebequest</s>  mr</s>  dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wifeand daughters than for himself or his sonbut to his son and hissons son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way asto leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dearto him and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate orby any sale of its valuable woods</s>  the whole was tied up for thebenefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father andmother at norland had so far gained on the affections of his uncle bysuch attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or threeyears old an imperfect articulation an earnest desire of having hisown way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise as to outweighall the value of all the attention which for years he had receivedfrom his niece and her daughters</s>  he meant not to be unkind howeverand as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them athousand pounds apiece</s> mr</s>  dashwoods disappointment was at first severe but his temper wascheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many yearsand by living economically lay by a considerable sum from the produceof an estate already large and capable of almost immediateimprovement</s>  but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming washis only one twelvemonth</s>  he survived his uncle no longer and tenthousand pounds including the late legacies was all that remained forhis widow and daughters</s> his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr</s> dashwood recommended with all the strength and urgency which illnesscould command the interest of his motherinlaw and sisters</s> mr</s>  john dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of thefamily but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature atsuch a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to makethem comfortable</s>  his father was rendered easy by such an assuranceand mr</s>  john dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there mightprudently be in his power to do for them</s> he was not an illdisposed young man unless to be rather cold heartedand rather selfish is to be illdisposed but he was in general wellrespected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge ofhis ordinary duties</s>  had he married a more amiable woman he mighthave been made still more respectable than he washe might even havebeen made amiable himself for he was very young when he married andvery fond of his wife</s>  but mrs</s>  john dashwood was a strong caricatureof himselfmore narrowminded and selfish</s> when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself toincrease the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousandpounds apiece</s>  he then really thought himself equal to it</s>  theprospect of four thousand ayear in addition to his present incomebesides the remaining half of his own mothers fortune warmed hisheart and made him feel capable of generosity</s>  yes he would givethem three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome</s>  it wouldbe enough to make them completely easy</s>  three thousand pounds</s>  hecould spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience</s>  hethought of it all day long and for many days successively and he didnot repent</s> no sooner was his fathers funeral over than mrs</s>  john dashwoodwithout sending any notice of her intention to her motherinlawarrived with her child and their attendants</s>  no one could dispute herright to come the house was her husbands from the moment of hisfathers decease but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much thegreater and to a woman in mrs</s>  dashwoods situation with only commonfeelings must have been highly unpleasingbut in her mind there wasa sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence ofthe kind by whomsoever given or received was to her a source ofimmovable disgust</s>  mrs</s>  john dashwood had never been a favourite withany of her husbands family but she had had no opportunity till thepresent of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort ofother people she could act when occasion required it</s> so acutely did mrs</s>  dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour and soearnestly did she despise her daughterinlaw for it that on thearrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever hadnot the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on thepropriety of going and her own tender love for all her three childrendetermined her afterwards to stay and for their sakes avoid a breachwith their brother</s> elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possesseda strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualifiedher though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother andenabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them allthat eagerness of mind in mrs</s>  dashwood which must generally have ledto imprudence</s>  she had an excellent hearther disposition wasaffectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to governthem it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and whichone of her sisters had resolved never to be taught</s> mariannes abilities were in many respects quite equal to elinors</s> she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows herjoys could have no moderation</s>  she was generous amiableinteresting she was everything but prudent</s>  the resemblance betweenher and her mother was strikingly great</s> elinor saw with concern the excess of her sisters sensibility butby mrs</s>  dashwood it was valued and cherished</s>  they encouraged eachother now in the violence of their affliction</s>  the agony of griefwhich overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was soughtfor was created again and again</s>  they gave themselves up wholly totheir sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection thatcould afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation infuture</s>  elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she couldstruggle she could exert herself</s>  she could consult with her brothercould receive her sisterinlaw on her arrival and treat her withproper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similarexertion and encourage her to similar forbearance</s> margaret the other sister was a goodhumored welldisposed girl butas she had already imbibed a good deal of mariannes romance withouthaving much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equalher sisters at a more advanced period of life</s> chapter 2mrs</s>  john dashwood now installed herself mistress of norland and hermother and sistersinlaw were degraded to the condition of visitors</s> as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and byher husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybodybeyond himself his wife and their child</s>  he really pressed themwith some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as noplan appeared so eligible to mrs</s>  dashwood as remaining there till shecould accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood hisinvitation was accepted</s> a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of formerdelight was exactly what suited her mind</s>  in seasons of cheerfulnessno temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greaterdegree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happinessitself</s>  but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancyand as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy</s> mrs</s>  john dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intendedto do for his sisters</s>  to take three thousand pounds from the fortuneof their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the mostdreadful degree</s>  she begged him to think again on the subject</s>  howcould he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child tooof so large a sum</s>  and what possible claim could the miss dashwoodswho were related to him only by half blood which she considered as norelationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount</s>  itwas very well known that no affection was ever supposed to existbetween the children of any man by different marriages and why was heto ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all hismoney to his half sisters</s> it was my fathers last request to me replied her husband that ishould assist his widow and daughters</s>
he did not know what he was talking of i dare say ten to one but hewas lightheaded at the time</s>  had he been in his right senses hecould not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away halfyour fortune from your own child</s> he did not stipulate for any particular sum my dear fanny he onlyrequested me in general terms to assist them and make theirsituation more comfortable than it was in his power to do</s>  perhaps itwould have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself</s>  he couldhardly suppose i should neglect them</s>  but as he required the promisei could not do less than give it at least i thought so at the time</s> the promise therefore was given and must be performed</s>  somethingmust be done for them whenever they leave norland and settle in a newhome</s> well then let something be done for them but that something neednot be three thousand pounds</s>  consider she added that when themoney is once parted with it never can return</s>  your sisters willmarry and it will be gone for ever</s>  if indeed it could be restoredto our poor little boywhy to be sure said her husband very gravely that would makegreat difference</s>  the time may come when harry will regret that solarge a sum was parted with</s>  if he should have a numerous family forinstance it would be a very convenient addition</s> to be sure it would</s> perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum werediminished one half</s> five hundred pounds would be a prodigiousincrease to their fortunes</s> oh</s>  beyond anything great</s>  what brother on earth would do half somuch for his sisters even if really his sisters</s>  and as it isonlyhalf blood</s> but you have such a generous spirit</s> i would not wish to do any thing mean he replied</s>  one had ratheron such occasions do too much than too little</s>  no one at least canthink i have not done enough for them even themselves they can hardlyexpect more</s> there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we arenot to think of their expectations the question is what you canafford to do</s> certainlyand i think i may afford to give them five hundred poundsapiece</s>  as it is without any addition of mine they will each haveabout three thousand pounds on their mothers deatha very comfortablefortune for any young woman</s> to be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that they can want noaddition at all</s>  they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongstthem</s>  if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they donot they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of tenthousand pounds</s> that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon thewhole it would not be more advisable to do something for their motherwhile she lives rather than for themsomething of the annuity kind imean</s> my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself</s> a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable</s> his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to thisplan</s> to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundredpounds at once</s>  but then if mrs</s>  dashwood should live fifteen yearswe shall be completely taken in</s>
 my dear fanny her life cannot be worth half thatpurchase</s> certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever whenthere is an annuity to be paid them and she is very stout and healthyand hardly forty</s>  an annuity is a very serious business it comes overand over every year and there is no getting rid of it</s>  you are notaware of what you are doing</s>  i have known a great deal of the troubleof annuities for my mother was clogged with the payment of three toold superannuated servants by my fathers will and it is amazing howdisagreeable she found it</s>  twice every year these annuities were to bepaid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and thenone of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to beno such thing</s>  my mother was quite sick of it</s>  her income was not herown she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the moreunkind in my father because otherwise the money would have beenentirely at my mothers disposal without any restriction whatever</s>  ithas given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i wouldnot pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world</s> it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr</s>  dashwood to havethose kind of yearly drains on ones income</s>  ones fortune as yourmother justly says is not ones own</s>  to be tied down to the regularpayment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable ittakes away ones independence</s> undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it</s>  they thinkthemselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raisesno gratitude at all</s>  if i were you whatever i did should be done atmy own discretion entirely</s>  i would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly</s>  it may be very inconvenient some years to spare ahundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses</s> i believe you are right my love it will be better that there shouldbe no annuity in the case whatever i may give them occasionally willbe of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because theywould only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a largerincome and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of theyear</s>  it will certainly be much the best way</s>  a present of fiftypounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed formoney and will i think be amply discharging my promise to my father</s> to be sure it will</s>  indeed to say the truth i am convinced withinmyself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money atall</s>  the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as mightbe reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for acomfortable small house for them helping them to move their thingsand sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever theyare in season</s>  ill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeedit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did</s>  do but considermy dear mr</s>  dashwood how excessively comfortable your motherinlawand her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand poundsbesides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls whichbrings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they willpay their mother for their board out of it</s>  altogether they will havefive hundred ayear amongst them and what on earth can four women wantfor more than that</s> they will live so cheap</s>  their housekeeping willbe nothing at all</s>  they will have no carriage no horses and hardlyany servants they will keep no company and can have no expenses ofany kind</s>  only conceive how comfortable they will be</s>  five hundred ayear</s>  i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and asto your giving them more it is quite absurd to think of it</s>  they willbe much more able to give you something</s> upon my word said mr</s>  dashwood i believe you are perfectly right</s> my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me thanwhat you say</s>  i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfilmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as youhave described</s>  when my mother removes into another house my servicesshall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can</s>  some littlepresent of furniture too may be acceptable then</s> certainly returned mrs</s>  john dashwood</s>  but however one thingmust be considered</s>  when your father and mother moved to norlandthough the furniture of stanhill was sold all the china plate andlinen was saved and is now left to your mother</s>  her house willtherefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it</s> that is a material consideration undoubtedly</s>  a valuable legacyindeed</s>  and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasantaddition to our own stock here</s> yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as whatbelongs to this house</s>  a great deal too handsome in my opinion forany place they can ever afford to live in</s>  but however so it is</s> your father thought only of them</s>  and i must say this that you owe noparticular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we verywell know that if he could he would have left almost everything in theworld to them</s> this argument was irresistible</s>  it gave to his intentions whatever ofdecision was wanting before and he finally resolved that it would beabsolutely unnecessary if not highly indecorous to do more for thewidow and children of his father than such kind of neighbourly acts ashis own wife pointed out</s> chapter 3mrs</s>  dashwood remained at norland several months not from anydisinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceasedto raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for whenher spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some otherexertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholyremembrances she was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in herinquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland forto remove far from that beloved spot was impossible</s>  but she couldhear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort andease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadierjudgment rejected several houses as too large for their income whichher mother would have approved</s> mrs</s>  dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise onthe part of his son in their favour which gave comfort to his lastearthly reflections</s>  she doubted the sincerity of this assurance nomore than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for herdaughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she waspersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would support her inaffluence</s>  for their brothers sake too for the sake of his ownheart she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to hismerit before in believing him incapable of generosity</s>  his attentivebehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfarewas dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on theliberality of his intentions</s> the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt forher daughterinlaw was very much increased by the farther knowledgeof her character which half a years residence in her family affordedand perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternalaffection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found itimpossible to have lived together so long had not a particularcircumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according tothe opinions of mrs</s>  dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland</s> this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl andthe brother of mrs</s>  john dashwood a gentlemanlike and pleasing youngman who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sistersestablishment at norland and who had since spent the greatest part ofhis time there</s> some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives ofinterest for edward ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had diedvery rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudencefor except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on thewill of his mother</s>  but mrs</s>  dashwood was alike uninfluenced by eitherconsideration</s>  it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiablethat he loved her daughter and that elinor returned the partiality</s> it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortuneshould keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance ofdisposition and that elinors merit should not be acknowledged byevery one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible</s> edward ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by anypeculiar graces of person or address</s>  he was not handsome and hismanners required intimacy to make them pleasing</s>  he was too diffidentto do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcomehis behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart</s> his understanding was good and his education had given it solidimprovement</s>  but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition toanswer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see himdistinguishedasthey hardly knew what</s>  they wanted him to make afine figure in the world in some manner or other</s>  his mother wished tointerest him in political concerns to get him into parliament or tosee him connected with some of the great men of the day</s>  mrs</s>  johndashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of thesesuperior blessings could be attained it would have quieted herambition to see him driving a barouche</s>  but edward had no turn forgreat men or barouches</s>  all his wishes centered in domestic comfortand the quiet of private life</s>  fortunately he had a younger brotherwho was more promising</s> edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engagedmuch of mrs</s>  dashwoods attention for she was at that time in suchaffliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects</s>  she sawonly that he was quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it</s>  hedid not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by illtimed conversation</s> she was first called to observe and approve him farther by areflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the differencebetween him and his sister</s>  it was a contrast which recommended himmost forcibly to her mother</s>
it is enough said she to say that he is unlike fanny is enough</s> it implies everything amiable</s>  i love him already</s> i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him</s> like him</s>  replied her mother with a smile</s>  i feel no sentiment ofapprobation inferior to love</s> you may esteem him</s> i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love</s> mrs</s>  dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him</s>  her mannerswere attaching and soon banished his reserve</s>  she speedilycomprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for elinorperhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of hisworth and even that quietness of manner which militated against allher established ideas of what a young mans address ought to

have notaste for drawing</s> no taste for drawing</s>  replied elinor why should you think so</s>  hedoes not draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing theperformances of other people and i assure you he is by no meansdeficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities ofimproving it</s>  had he ever been in the way of learning i think hewould have drawn very well</s>  he distrusts his own judgment in suchmatters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on anypicture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste whichin general direct him perfectly right</s> marianne was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject butthe kind of approbation which elinor described as excited in him by thedrawings of other people was very far from that rapturous delightwhich in her opinion could alone be called taste</s>  yet thoughsmiling within herself at the mistake she honoured her sister for thatblind partiality to edward which produced it</s> i hope marianne continued elinor you do not consider him asdeficient in general taste</s>  indeed i think i may say that you cannotfor your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if

believed it</s>  there was at times a want of spirits about himwhich if it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost asunpromising</s>  a doubt of her regard supposing him to feel it need notgive him more than inquietude</s>  it would not be likely to produce thatdejection of mind which frequently attended him</s>  a more reasonablecause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade theindulgence of his affection</s>  she knew that his mother neither behavedto him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give himany assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictlyattending to her views for his aggrandizement</s>  with such a knowledgeas this it was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject</s>  shewas far from depending on that result of his preference of her whichher mother and sister still considered as certain</s>  nay the longerthey were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regardand sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no morethan friendship</s> but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceivedby his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which wasstill more common to make her uncivil</s>
 she took the firstopportunity of affronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking toher so expressively of her brothers great expectations of mrs</s> ferrarss resolution that both her sons should marry well and of thedanger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in thatmrs</s>  dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor tobe calm</s>  she gave her an answer which marked her contempt andinstantly left the room resolving that whatever might be theinconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved elinorshould not be exposed another week to such insinuations</s> in this state of her spirits a letter was delivered to her from thepost which contained a proposal particularly well timed</s>  it was theoffer of a small house on very easy terms

understood that she was in need of adwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottagehe assured her that everything should be done to it which she mightthink necessary if the situation pleased her</s>  he earnestly pressedher after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come withher daughters to barton park the place of his own residence fromwhence she might judge herself whether barton cottage for the houseswere in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortableto her</s>  he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole ofhis letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail ofgiving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she wassuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearerconnections</s>  she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry</s>  herresolution was formed as she read</s>  the situation of barton in acounty so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hoursbefore would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh everypossible advantage belonging to the place was now its firstrecommendation</s>  to quit the neighbourhood of norland was no

thewhole well satisfied for though her former style of life rendered manyadditions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was adelight to her and she had at this time ready money enough to supplyall that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments</s>  as for thehouse itself to be sure said she it is too small for our familybut we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the

denied the satisfaction ofsending them his newspaper every day</s> lady middleton had sent a very civil message by him denoting herintention of waiting on mrs</s>  dashwood as soon as she could be assuredthat her visit would be no inconvenience and as this message wasanswered by an invitation equally polite her ladyship was introducedto them the next day</s> they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much oftheir comfort at barton must depend and the elegance of her appearancewas favourable to their wishes</s>  lady middleton was not more than sixor seven and twenty her face was handsome her figure tall andstriking and her address graceful</s>  her manners had all the elegancewhich her husbands wanted</s>  but they would have been improved by someshare of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough todetract something from their first admiration by shewing that thoughperfectly wellbred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say forherself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark</s> conversation however was not wanted for sir john was very chatty andlady middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her theireldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which meansthere was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case ofextremity for they had to enquire his name and age admire his beautyand ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hungabout her and held down his head to the great surprise of herladyship who wondered at his being so shy before company as he couldmake noise enough at home</s>  on every formal visit a child ought to beof the party by way of provision for discourse</s>  in the present caseit took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like hisfather or mother and in what particular he resembled either for ofcourse every body differed and every body was astonished at theopinion of the others</s> an opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods of debating on therest of the children as sir john would not leave the house withoutsecuring their promise of dining at the park the next day</s> chapter 7barton park was about half a mile from the cottage</s>  the ladies hadpassed near it in their way along the valley but it was screened fromtheir view at home by the projection of a hill</s>  the house was largeand handsome and the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitalityand elegance</s>  the former was for sir johns gratification the latterfor that of his lady</s>  they were scarcely ever without some friendsstaying with them in the house and they kept more company of everykind than any other family in the neighbourhood</s>  it was necessary tothe happiness of both for however dissimilar in temper and outwardbehaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want oftalent and taste which confined their employments unconnected withsuch as society produced within a very narrow compass</s>  sir john was asportsman lady middleton a mother</s>  he hunted and shot and shehumoured her children and these were their only resources</s>  ladymiddleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all theyear round while sir johns independent employments were in existenceonly half the time</s>  continual engagements at home and abroad howeversupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education supported thegood spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of hiswife</s> lady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table and ofall her domestic arrangements and from this kind of vanity was hergreatest enjoyment in any of their parties</s>  but sir johnssatisfaction in society was much more real he delighted in collectingabout him more young people than his house would hold and the noisierthey were the better was he pleased</s>  he was a blessing to all thejuvenile part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for everforming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winterhis private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was notsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen</s> the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joyto him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitantshe had now procured for his cottage at barton</s>  the miss dashwoods wereyoung pretty and unaffected</s>  it was enough to secure his goodopinion for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want tomake her mind as captivating as her person</s>  the friendliness of hisdisposition made him happy in accommodating those whose situationmight be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate</s>  inshowing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfactionof a good heart and in settling a family of females only in hiscottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman for a sportsmanthough he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise isnot

barton park with unaffected sincerityand as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the youngladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the daybefore at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them</s>  theywould see he said only one gentleman there besides himself aparticular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither veryyoung nor very gay</s>  he hoped they would all excuse the smallness ofthe party and could assure them it should never happen so again</s>  hehad been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring someaddition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was fullof engagements</s>  luckily lady middletons mother had arrived at bartonwithin the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable womanhe hoped

commonplace railleryas mrs</s>  jenningss</s> colonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted byresemblance of manner to be his friend than lady middleton was to behis wife or mrs</s>  jennings to be lady middletons mother</s>  he wassilent and grave</s>  his appearance however was not unpleasing in spiteof his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute oldbachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but thoughhis face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and hisaddress was particularly gentlemanlike</s> there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them ascompanions to the dashwoods but the cold insipidity of lady middletonwas so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity ofcolonel brandon and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and hismotherinlaw was interesting</s>  lady middleton seemed to be roused toenjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinnerwho pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind ofdiscourse except what related to themselves</s> in the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical she wasinvited to play</s>  the instrument was unlocked every body prepared tobe charmed and marianne who sang very well at their request wentthrough the chief of the songs which lady middleton had brought intothe family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since inthe same position on the pianoforte for her ladyship had celebratedthat event by giving up music although by her mothers account shehad played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it</s> mariannes performance was highly applauded</s>  sir john was loud in hisadmiration at the end of every song and as loud in his conversationwith the others while every song lasted</s>

colonel brandon alone of all theparty heard her without being in raptures</s>  he paid her only thecompliment of attention and she felt a respect for him on theoccasion which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shamelesswant of taste</s>  his pleasure in music though it amounted not to thatecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own wasestimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of theothers and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five andthirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and everyexquisite power of enjoyment</s>  she was perfectly disposed to make everyallowance for the colonels advanced state of life which humanityrequired</s> chapter 8mrs</s>  jennings was a widow with an ample jointure</s>  she had only twodaughters both of whom she had lived to see respectably married andshe had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of theworld</s>  in the promotion of this object she was zealously active asfar as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projectingweddings among all the young people of her acquaintance</s>  she wasremarkably quick in the discovery of attachments and had enjoyed theadvantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady byinsinuations of her power over such a young man and this kind ofdiscernment enabled her soon after her arrival at barton decisively topronounce that colonel brandon was very much in love with mariannedashwood</s>  she rather suspected it to be so on the very first eveningof their being together from his listening so attentively while shesang to them and when the visit was returned by the middletons diningat the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again</s> it must be so</s>  she was perfectly convinced of it</s>  it would be anexcellent match for he was rich and she was handsome</s>  mrs</s>  jenningshad been anxious to see colonel brandon well married ever since herconnection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge and shewas always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl</s> the immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable forit supplied her with endless jokes against them both</s>  at the park shelaughed at the colonel and in the cottage at marianne</s>  to the formerher raillery was probably as far as it regarded only himselfperfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at firstincomprehensible and when its object was understood she hardly knewwhether most to laugh at its absurdity or censure its impertinencefor she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonelsadvanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor</s> mrs</s>  dashwood who could not think a man five years younger

mama you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusationthough you may not think it intentionally illnatured</s>  colonel brandonis certainly younger than mrs</s>  jennings but he is old enough to be

convince you thata woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirtyfiveanything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her</s> but i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and his wife to theconstant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced tocomplain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel inone of his shoulders</s> but he

set off</s>  marianne had at first the advantage but a false stepbrought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stopherself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached

together his musical talents were considerableand he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward hadunfortunately wanted</s> in mrs</s>  dashwoods estimation he was as faultless as in

attention to persons orcircumstances</s>  in hastily forming and giving his opinion of otherpeople in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undividedattention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily theforms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which elinorcould not approve in spite of all that he and marianne could say inits support</s> marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seizedher at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy herideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable</s>  willoughby wasall that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in everybrighter period as capable of attaching her and his behaviourdeclared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest as his abilitieswere

arose was removed when his feelingsbegan really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility</s> elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentimentswhich mrs</s>  jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were nowactually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblanceof disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr</s> willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was nohindrance to the regard of colonel brandon</s>  she saw it with concernfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to avery lively one of five and twenty</s>  and as she could not even wish himsuccessful she heartily wished him indifferent</s>  she liked himinspite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object ofinterest</s>  his manners though serious were mild and his reserveappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of anynatural gloominess of temper</s>  sir john had dropped hints of pastinjuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his beingan unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion</s> perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted bywilloughby and marianne who prejudiced against him for being neitherlively nor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits</s> brandon is just the kind of man said willoughby one day when theywere talking of him together whom every body speaks well of andnobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembersto talk to</s> that is exactly what i think of him cried marianne</s> do not boast of it however said elinor for it is injustice inboth of you</s>  he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park andi never see him myself without

may have extended to theexistence of nabobs gold mohrs and palanquins</s> i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much furtherthan your candour</s>  but why should you dislike him</s> i do not dislike him</s>  i consider him on the contrary as a veryrespectable man who has every bodys good word and nobodys noticewho has more money than he can spend more time than he knows

privateballs at the park then began and parties on the water were made andaccomplished as often as a showery october would allow</s>  in everymeeting of the kind willoughby was included and the ease andfamiliarity which naturally attended these parties were exactlycalculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with thedashwoods to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies ofmarianne of marking his animated admiration of her and of receivingin her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of heraffection</s> elinor could not be surprised at their attachment</s>  she only wishedthat it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture tosuggest the propriety of some selfcommand to marianne</s>  but marianneabhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserveand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselvesillaudable appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but adisgraceful subjection of reason to commonplace and mistaken notions</s> willoughby thought the same and their behaviour at all times was anillustration of their opinions</s> when he was present she had no eyes for any one else</s>  every thing hedid was right</s>  every thing he said was clever</s>  if their evenings atthe park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the restof the party to get her a good hand</s>  if dancing formed the amusementof the night they were partners for half the time and when obliged toseparate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together andscarcely spoke a word to any body else</s>  such conduct made them ofcourse most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame andseemed hardly to provoke them</s> mrs</s>  dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which lefther no inclination for checking this excessive display of them</s>  to herit was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young andardent mind</s> this was the season of happiness to marianne</s>  her heart was devoted towilloughby and the fond attachment to norland which she brought withher from sussex was more likely to be softened than she had thought itpossible before by the charms which his society bestowed on herpresent home</s> elinors happiness was not so great</s>  her heart was not so much atease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure</s>  they affordedher no companion that could make amends for what she had left behindnor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret thanever</s>  neither lady middleton nor mrs</s>  jennings could supply to her theconversation she missed although the latter was an everlasting talkerand from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her alarge share of her discourse</s>  she had already repeated her own historyto elinor three or four times and had elinors memory been equal toher means of improvement she might have known very early in theiracquaintance all the particulars of mr</s>  jenningss last illness andwhat he said to his wife a few minutes before he died</s>  lady middletonwas more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent</s>  elinorneeded little observation to perceive that her reserve was a merecalmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do</s>  towards herhusband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy wastherefore neither to be looked for nor desired</s>  she had nothing to sayone day that she had not said the day before</s>  her insipidity wasinvariable for even her spirits were always the same

them than she mighthave experienced in sitting at homeand so little did her presenceadd to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversationthat they were sometimes only reminded of her

hisattentions were wholly mariannes and a far less agreeable man mighthave been more generally pleasing</s>  colonel brandon unfortunately forhimself had no such encouragement to think only of marianne and inconversing with elinor he found the greatest consolation for theindifference of her sister</s> elinors compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspectthat the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him</s> this suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped fromhim one evening at the park when they were sitting down together bymutual consent while the others were dancing</s>  his eyes were fixed onmarianne and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faintsmile your sister i understand does not approve of

reflecting onthe character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not</s> a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis ofcommon sense and observation and then they may be more easy to defineand to justify than they now are by any body but herself</s> this will probably be the case he replied and yet there issomething so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind

all thecharms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for</s>  hersystems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety atnought and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forwardto as her greatest possible advantage</s> after a short pause he resumed the conversation by sayingdoes your sister make no distinction in her objections against asecond attachment</s>

was it required buta slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tenderrecollection of past regard</s>  elinor attempted no more</s>  but mariannein her place would not have done so little</s>  the whole story wouldhave been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thingestablished in the most melancholy order of disastrous love</s> chapter 12as elinor and marianne were walking together the next morning thelatter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite ofall that she knew before of mariannes imprudence and want of thoughtsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both</s>  marianne told herwith the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse onethat he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which wasexactly calculated to carry a woman</s>  without considering that it wasnot in her mothers plan to keep any horse that if she were to alterher resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for

as to an additional servantthe expense would be a trifle mama she was sure would never object toit and any horse would do for him he might always get one at thepark as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient</s>  elinor thenventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from aman so little or at least so lately known to her</s>  this was too much</s> you are mistaken

sevendays are more than enough for others</s>  i should hold myself guilty ofgreater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother than fromwilloughby</s>  of john i know very little though we have lived togetherfor years but of willoughby my judgment has long been formed</s> elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more</s>  she knew hersisters temper</s>  opposition on so tender a subject would only attachher the more to her own opinion</s>  but by an appeal to her affection forher mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgentmother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case sheconsented to this increase of establishment marianne was shortlysubdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudentkindness by mentioning the offer and to tell willoughby when she sawhim next that it must be declined</s> she was faithful to her word and when willoughby called at thecottage the same day elinor heard her express her disappointment tohim in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of hispresent</s>  the reasons for this alteration were at the same timerelated and they were such as to make further entreaty on his sideimpossible</s>  his concern however was very apparent and afterexpressing it with earnestness he added in the same low voicebutmarianne the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now</s>  ishall keep it only till you can claim it</s>  when you leave barton toform your own establishment in a more lasting home queen mab shallreceive you</s> this was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the whole of thesentence in his manner of pronouncing it and in his addressing hersister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy sodecided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement betweenthem</s>  from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to eachother and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she orany of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discoverit by accident</s> margaret related something to her the next day which placed thismatter in a still clearer light</s>  willoughby had spent the precedingevening with them

looking at her sister and saying i must nottell may i elinor</s> this of course made every body laugh and elinor tried to laugh too</s> but the effort was painful</s>  she was convinced that margaret had fixedon a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become astanding joke with mrs</s>  jennings</s> marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than goodto the cause

 i know where you spent the morning</s> marianne coloured and replied very hastily where pray</s> did not you know said willoughby that we had been out in mycurricle</s>
 impudence i know that very well and i was determinedto find out where you had been to</s>  i hope you like your house missmarianne</s>  it is a very large one i know and when i come to see youi hope you will have newfurnished it for it wanted it very much wheni was there six years ago</s> marianne turned away in great confusion</s>  mrs</s>  jennings laughedheartily and elinor found that in her resolution to know where theyhad been she had actually made her own woman enquire of mr</s> willoughbys groom and that she had by that method been informed thatthey had gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there inwalking about the garden and going all over the house</s> elinor could hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikelythat willoughby should propose or marianne consent to enter the housewhile mrs</s>  smith was in it with whom marianne had not the smallestacquaintance</s> as soon as they left the diningroom elinor enquired of her about itand great was her surprise when she found that every circumstancerelated by mrs</s>  jennings was perfectly true</s>  marianne was quite angrywith her for doubting it</s> why should you imagine elinor that we did not go there or that wedid not see the house</s>  is not it what you have often wished to doyourself</s> yes marianne but i would not go while mrs</s>  smith was there and withno other companion than mr</s>  willoughby</s> mr</s>  willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shewthat house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible tohave any other companion</s>  i never spent a pleasanter morning in mylife</s> i am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness of an employmentdoes not always evince its propriety</s> on the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it elinor for ifthere had been any real impropriety in what i did i should have beensensible of it at the time for we always know when we are actingwrong and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure</s> but my dear marianne as it has already exposed you to some veryimpertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion ofyour own conduct</s> if the impertinent remarks of mrs</s>  jennings are to be the proof ofimpropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives</s> i value not her censure any more than i should do her commendation</s>  iam not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over mrs</s> smiths grounds or in seeing her house</s>  they will one day be mr</s> willoughbys andif they were one day to be your own marianne you would not bejustified in what you have done</s> she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to herand after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to hersister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it wasrather illjudged in me to go to allenham but mr</s>  willoughby wantedparticularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house i assureyou</s> there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nicecomfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it wouldbe delightful</s>  it is a corner room and has windows on two sides</s>  onone side you look across the bowlinggreen behind the house to abeautiful hanging wood and on the other you have a view of the churchand village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have sooften admired</s>  i did not see it to advantage for nothing could bemore forlorn than the furniturebut if it were newly fitted upacouple of hundred pounds willoughby says would make it one of thepleasantest summerrooms in england</s> could elinor have listened to her without interruption from the othersshe would have described every room in the house with equal delight</s> chapter 14the sudden termination of colonel brandons visit at the park with hissteadiness in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised thewonder of mrs</s>  jennings for two or three days she was a greatwonderer as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in allthe comings and goings of all their acquaintance</s>  she wondered withlittle intermission what could be the reason of it was

thetruth of it</s>  perhaps it is about miss williams and by the bye i daresay it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her</s>  may beshe is ill in town nothing in the world more likely

conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose</s> elinor though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonelbrandon could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly awaywhich mrs</s>  jennings was desirous of her feeling for besides that thecircumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement orvariety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of</s>  it wasengrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby onthe subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to themall</s>  as this silence continued every day made it appear more strangeand more incompatible with the disposition of both</s>  why they shouldnot openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constantbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place elinor could notimagine</s> she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately intheir power for though willoughby was independent there was no reasonto believe him rich</s>  his estate had been rated by sir john at aboutsix or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which thatincome could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained ofhis poverty</s>  but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by themrelative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at allshe could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to theirgeneral opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mindof their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent hermaking any inquiry of marianne</s> nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all thanwilloughbys behaviour</s>  to marianne it had all the distinguishingtenderness which a lovers heart could give and to the rest of thefamily it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother</s>  thecottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many moreof his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no generalengagement collected them at the park the exercise which called himout in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the restof the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by hisfavourite pointer at her feet</s> one evening in particular about a week after colonel brandon left thecountry his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling ofattachment to the objects around him and

 he exclaimedimprove this dear cottage</s>  no</s>  that i willnever consent to</s>  not a stone must be added to its walls not an inchto its size if my feelings are regarded</s> do not be alarmed said miss dashwood nothing of the kind will bedone for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it</s> i am heartily glad of it he cried</s>  may she always be poor if shecan employ her riches no better</s> thank you willoughby</s>  but you may be assured that i would notsacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any onewhom i loved for all the improvements in the world</s>  depend upon itthat whatever unemployed sum may remain when i make up my accounts inthe spring i would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of itin a manner so painful to you</s>  but are you really so attached to thisplace as to see no defect in it</s> i am said he</s>  to me it is faultless</s>  nay more i consider it asthe only form of building in which happiness is attainable and were irich enough i would instantly pull combe down and build it up again inthe exact plan of this cottage</s> with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes i suppose saidelinor</s> yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thingbelonging to itin no one convenience or inconvenience about itshould the least variation be perceptible</s>  then and then only undersuch a roof i might perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been atbarton</s> i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantageof better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find yourown house as faultless as you now do this</s> there certainly are circumstances said willoughby which mightgreatly endear it to me but this place will always have one claim ofmy affection which no other can possibly share</s> mrs</s>  dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne whose fine eyes werefixed so expressively on willoughby as plainly denoted how well sheunderstood him</s> how often did i wish added he when i was at allenham this timetwelvemonth that barton cottage were inhabited</s>  i never passed withinview of it without admiring its situation and grieving that no oneshould live in it</s>  how little did i then think that the very firstnews i should hear from mrs</s>  smith when i next came into the countrywould be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediatesatisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind ofprescience of what happiness i should experience from it can accountfor</s>  must it not have been so marianne</s>  speaking to her in a loweredvoice</s>  then continuing his former tone he said and yet this houseyou would spoil mrs</s>  dashwood</s>  you would rob it of its simplicity byimaginary improvement</s>  and this dear parlour in which our acquaintancefirst began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent byus together you would degrade to the condition of a common entranceand every body would be eager to pass through the room which hashitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfortthan any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the worldcould possibly afford</s> mrs</s>  dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind shouldbe attempted</s> you are a good woman he warmly replied</s>  your promise makes meeasy</s>  extend it a little farther and it will make me happy</s>  tell methat not only your house will remain the same but that i shall everfind you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you willalways consider me with the kindness which has made everythingbelonging to you so dear to me</s> the promise was readily given and willoughbys behaviour during thewhole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness</s> shall we see you tomorrow to dinner</s>  said mrs</s>  dashwood when he wasleaving them</s>  i do not ask you to come in the morning for we mustwalk to the park to call on lady middleton</s> he engaged to be with them by four oclock</s> chapter 15mrs</s>  dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place the next day andtwo of her daughters went with her but marianne excused herself frombeing of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and hermother who concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby thenight before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectlysatisfied with her remaining at home</s> on their return from the park they found willoughbys curricle andservant in waiting at the cottage and mrs</s>  dashwood was convinced thather conjecture had been just</s>  so far it was all as she had foreseenbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught herto expect</s>  they were no sooner in the passage than marianne camehastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with herhandkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs</s> surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room

strongly partook of theemotion which overpowered marianne</s> is anything the matter with her</s>  cried mrs</s>  dashwood as sheenteredis she ill</s> i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forcedsmile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be illfor iam now suffering under a very heavy disappointment</s> disappointment</s> yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with

elinor felt equalamazement</s>  for a few moments every one was silent</s>  mrs</s>  dashwoodfirst spoke</s> i have only to add my dear willoughby that at barton cottage youwill always be welcome for

doubt your inclination</s> my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are ofsuch a naturethati dare not flatter myselfhe stopt</s>  mrs</s>  dashwood was too much astonished to speak and anotherpause succeeded</s>  this was broken by willoughby who said with a faintsmile it is folly to linger in this manner</s>  i will not tormentmyself any longer by remaining among friends whose

dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly quitted theparlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which thissudden departure occasioned</s> elinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers</s>  she thought ofwhat had just passed with anxiety and distrust</s>  willoughbys behaviourin taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation ofcheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mothersinvitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himselfgreatly disturbed her</s>  one moment she feared that no serious designhad ever been formed on his side

though when she considered what marianneslove for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible</s> but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sistersaffliction was indubitable and she thought with the tenderestcompassion of that violent sorrow which marianne was in all probabilitynot merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as aduty</s> in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes werered her countenance was not uncheerful</s> our dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor said sheas she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart

well as to you</s> can you indeed</s> yes</s>  i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory waybutyou elinor who love to doubt where you canit will not satisfy youi know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it</s>  i ampersuaded that mrs</s>  smith suspects his regard for marianne disapprovesof it perhaps because she has other views for him and on thataccount is eager to get him awayand that the business which shesends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him</s> this is what i believe to have happened</s>  he is moreover aware thatshe does disapprove the connection he dares not therefore at presentconfess to her his engagement with marianne and he feels himselfobliged from his dependent situation to give into her schemes andabsent himself from devonshire for a while</s>  you will tell me i knowthat this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavilunless you can point out any other method of understanding the affairas

incomprehensible are your feelings</s>  you had rathertake evil upon credit than good</s>  you had rather look out for miseryfor marianne and guilt for poor willoughby than an apology for

reason in the world to think illof</s>  to the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves thoughunavoidably secret for a while</s>  and after all what is it you suspecthim of</s> i can hardly tell myself</s>  but suspicion of something unpleasant isthe inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessedin him</s>  there is great truth however in what you have now urged ofthe allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to becandid in my judgment of every body</s>  willoughby may undoubtedly havevery sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has</s> but it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge them atonce</s>  secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering atits being practiced by him</s> do not blame him however for departing from his character where thedeviation is necessary</s>  but you really do admit the justice of what ihave said in his defence</s> i am happyand he is acquitted</s> not entirely</s>  it may be proper to conceal their engagement if theyare engaged from mrs</s>  smithand if that is the case it must behighly expedient for willoughby to be but little in devonshire atpresent</s>  but this is no excuse for their concealing it from us</s> concealing it from us</s>  my dear child do you accuse willoughby andmarianne of concealment</s>  this is strange indeed when your eyes havebeen reproaching them every day for incautiousness</s> i want no proof of their affection said elinor but of theirengagement i do</s> i am perfectly satisfied of both</s> yet not a syllable has been said

ofconfidence</s> i confess replied elinor that every circumstance except one is infavour of their engagement but that one is the total silence of bothon the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other</s> how strange this is</s>  you must think wretchedly indeed of willoughbyif after all that has openly passed between them you can doubt thenature of the terms on which they are together</s>  has he been acting apart in his behaviour to your sister all this time</s>  do you suppose himreally indifferent to her</s> no i cannot think that</s>  he must and does love her i am

temptation of returning here soon and yet awarethat by declining your invitation by saying that he was going away forsome time he should seem to act an ungenerous a suspicious part byour family he might well be embarrassed and disturbed</s>  in such acase a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been moreto his honour i think as well as more consistent with his generalcharacterbut

astonished to see edward himselfcome out</s> i am going into the village to see my horses said he as you arenot yet ready for breakfast i shall be back again presently</s>     edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surroundingcountry in his walk to the village he had seen many parts of thevalley to advantage and the village itself in a much higher situationthan the cottage afforded a general view of the whole which hadexceedingly pleased him</s>  this was a subject which ensured mariannesattention and she was beginning to describe her own admiration ofthese scenes and to question him more minutely on the objects that hadparticularly struck him when edward interrupted her by saying youmust not enquire too far marianneremember i have no knowledge in thepicturesque and i shall

brush wood but these are all lost on me</s>  i know nothing ofthe picturesque</s> i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should youboast of it</s> i suspect said elinor that to avoid one

admiration of landscape sceneryis become a mere jargon</s>  every body pretends to feel and tries todescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined whatpicturesque beauty was</s>  i detest jargon of every kind and sometimes ihave kept my feelings to myself because i could find no language todescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense andmeaning</s> i am convinced said edward that you really feel all the delight ina fine prospect which you profess to feel</s>  but in return your sistermust allow me to feel no more than i profess</s>  i like a fine

met his eye and looked conscious likewise</s>  that the hairwas her own she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as mariannethe only difference in their conclusions was that what marianneconsidered as a free gift from her sister elinor was conscious musthave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself</s> she was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront andaffecting to take no notice of what passed by instantly talking ofsomething else she internally resolved henceforward to catch everyopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself beyond alldoubt that it was exactly the shade of her own</s> edwards embarrassment lasted some time and it ended in an absence ofmind still more settled</s>  he was particularly grave the whole morning</s> marianne

said he in a low voice to miss dashwood by whom hewas sitting</s> she gave him a brief reply</s>  mariannes countenance was morecommunicative</s>  edward saw enough to comprehend not only the

at the end of a week in spite of theirwishes and his own and without any restraint on his time</s> elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to hismothers account and it was happy

sometimes displeased with his uncertainbehaviour to herself she was very well disposed on the whole to regardhis actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualificationswhich had been rather

to them all in the parting whichshortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on elinorsfeelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue</s> but as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herselffrom appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on hisgoing away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed bymarianne on a similar

and i admire your taste very much for i thinkhe is extremely handsome</s>  we do not live a great way from him in thecountry you know</s>  not above ten miles i dare say</s> much nearer thirty said her husband</s> ah well</s>  there is not much difference</s>  i never was at his house butthey say it is a sweet pretty place</s> as vile a spot as i ever saw in my life said mr</s>  palmer</s> marianne remained perfectly silent though her countenance betrayed herinterest in what was said</s> is it very ugly</s>  continued mrs</s>  palmerthen it must be some otherplace that is so pretty i suppose</s> when they were seated in the dining room sir john observed with regretthat they were only eight all together</s> my dear said he to his lady it is very provoking that we should beso few</s>  why did not you ask the gilberts to come to us today</s> did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it beforethat it could not be done</s>  they dined with us last</s> you and i sir john said mrs</s>  jennings should not stand upon suchceremony</s> then you would be very illbred cried mr</s>  palmer</s> my love you contradict every body said his wife with her usuallaugh</s>  do you know that you are quite rude</s> i did not know i contradicted any body in calling your motherillbred</s> ay you may abuse me as you please said the goodnatured old ladyyou have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot give her back again</s> so there i have the whip hand of you</s> charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get ridof her and exultingly said she did not care how cross he was to heras they must live together</s>  it was impossible for any one to be morethoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy than mrs</s> palmer</s>  the studied indifference insolence and discontent of herhusband gave her no pain and when he scolded or abused her she washighly diverted</s> mr</s>  palmer is so droll</s>  said she in a whisper to elinor</s>  he isalways out of humour</s> elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him creditfor being so genuinely and unaffectedly illnatured or illbred as hewished to appear</s>  his temper might perhaps be a little soured byfinding like many others of his sex that through some unaccountablebias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very sillywomanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for anysensible man to be lastingly hurt by it</s>  it was rather a wish ofdistinction she believed which produced his contemptuous treatment ofevery body and his general abuse of every thing before him</s>  it wasthe desire of appearing superior to other people</s>  the motive was toocommon to be wondered at but the means however they might succeed byestablishing his superiority in illbreeding were not likely to attachany one to him except his wife</s> oh my dear miss dashwood said mrs</s>  palmer soon afterwards i havegot such a favour to ask of you and your sister</s>  will you come andspend some time at cleveland this christmas</s>  now pray doand comewhile the westons are with us</s>  you cannot think how happy i shall be</s> it will be quite delightful</s> my love applying to her husband dontyou long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland</s> certainly he replied with a sneeri came into devonshire with noother view</s> there nowsaid his lady you see mr</s>  palmer expects you so youcannot refuse to come</s> they both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation</s> but indeed you must and shall come</s>  i am sure you will like it of allthings</s>  the westons will be with us and it will be quite delightful</s> you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gaynow for mr</s>  palmer is always going about the country canvassingagainst the election and so many people came to dine with us that inever saw before it is quite charming</s>  but poor fellow</s>  it is veryfatiguing to him</s>  for he is forced to make every body like him</s> elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to thehardship of such an obligation</s> how charming it will be said charlotte when he is inparliament</s> wont it</s>  how i shall laugh</s>  it will be so ridiculous tosee all his letters directed to him with an m</s> p</s> but do you know hesays he will never frank for me</s>  he declares he wont</s>  dont youmr</s>  palmer</s> mr</s>  palmer took no notice of her</s> he cannot bear writing you know she continuedhe says it is quiteshocking</s> no said he i never said any thing so irrational</s>  dont palm allyour abuses of languages upon me</s> there now you see how droll he is</s>  this is always the way with him</s> sometimes he wont speak to me for half a day together and then hecomes out with something so drollall about any thing in the world</s> she surprised elinor very much as they returned into the drawingroomby asking her whether she did not like mr</s>  palmer excessively</s> certainly said elinor he seems very agreeable</s> welli am so glad you do</s>  i thought you would he is so pleasantand mr</s>  palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters i cantell you and you cant think how disappointed he will be if you dontcome to cleveland</s> i cant imagine why you should object to it</s> elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing thesubject put a stop to her entreaties</s>  she thought it probable that asthey lived in the same county mrs</s>  palmer might be able to give somemore particular account of willoughbys general character than couldbe gathered from the middletons partial acquaintance with him and shewas eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits asmight remove the possibility of fear from marianne</s>  she began byinquiring if they saw much of mr</s>  willoughby at cleveland and whetherthey were intimately acquainted with him</s> oh dear yes i know him extremely well replied mrs</s>  palmernotthat i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town</s> somehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton while he wasat allenham</s>  mama saw him here once beforebut i was with my uncleat weymouth</s>  however i dare say we should have seen a great deal ofhim in somersetshire if it had not happened very unluckily that weshould never have been in the country together</s>  he is very little atcombe i believe but if he were ever so much there i do not think mr</s> palmer would visit him for he is in the opposition you know andbesides it is such a way off</s>  i know why you inquire about him verywell your sister is to marry him</s>  i am monstrous glad of it for theni shall have her for a neighbour you know</s> upon my word replied elinor you know much more of the matter thani do if you have any reason to expect such a match</s> dont pretend to deny it because you know it is what every body talksof</s>  i assure you i heard of it in my way through town</s> my dear mrs</s>  palmer</s> upon my honour i did</s> i met colonel brandon monday morning inbondstreet just before we left town and he told me of it directly</s> you surprise me very much</s>  colonel brandon tell you of it</s>  surelyyou must be mistaken</s>  to give such intelligence to a person who couldnot be interested in it even if it were true is not what i shouldexpect colonel brandon to do</s> but i do assure you it was so for all that and i will tell you howit happened</s>  when we met him he turned back and walked with us andso we began talking of my brother and sister and one thing andanother and i said to him so colonel there is a new family come tobarton cottage i hear and mama sends me word they are very prettyand that one of them is going to be married to mr</s>  willoughby of combemagna</s>  is it true pray</s>  for of course you must know as you have beenin devonshire so lately</s> and what did the colonel say</s> ohhe did not say much but he looked as if he knew it to be true sofrom that moment i set it down as certain</s>  it will be quitedelightful i declare</s>  when is it to take place</s> mr</s>  brandon was very well i hope</s> oh</s>  yes quite well and so full of your praises he did nothing butsay fine things of you</s> i am flattered by his commendation</s>  he seems an excellent man and ithink him uncommonly pleasing</s> so do i</s> he is such a charming man that it is quite a pity he shouldbe so grave and so dull</s>  mama says he was in love with your sistertoo</s>  i assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he hardlyever falls in love with any body</s> is mr</s>  willoughby much known in your part of somersetshire</s>  saidelinor</s> oh</s>  yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people areacquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they allthink him extremely agreeable i assure you</s>  nobody is more liked thanmr</s>  willoughby wherever he goes and so you may tell your sister</s>  sheis a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour not but that heis much more lucky in getting her because she is so very handsome andagreeable that nothing can be good enough for her</s>  however i dontthink her hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you for i thinkyou both excessively pretty and so does mr</s>  palmer too i am surethough we could not get him to own it last night</s> mrs</s>  palmers information respecting willoughby was not very materialbut any testimony in his favour however small was pleasing to her</s> i am so glad we are got acquainted at last

but if mama had not objected to it i dare say he would haveliked it of all things</s>  he had not seen me then above twice for itwas before i left school</s>  however i am much happier as i am</s>  mr</s> palmer is the kind of man i like</s> chapter 21the palmers returned to cleveland the next day and the two families atbarton were again left to entertain each other</s>  but this did not lastlong elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head hadhardly done wondering at charlottes being so happy without a cause atmr</s>  palmers acting so simply with good abilities and at the strangeunsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sirjohns and mrs</s>
 jenningss active zeal in the cause of societyprocured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe</s> in a mornings excursion to exeter they had met with two young ladieswhom mrs</s>  jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be herrelations and this was enough for sir john to invite them directly tothe park as soon as their present engagements at exeter were over</s> their engagements at exeter instantly gave way before such aninvitation and lady middleton was thrown into no little alarm on thereturn of sir john by hearing that she was very soon to receive avisit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life and of whoseelegancewhose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof forthe assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went fornothing at all</s>  their being her relations too made it so much theworse and mrs</s>  jenningss attempts at consolation were thereforeunfortunately founded when she advised her daughter not to care abouttheir being so fashionable because they were all cousins and must putup with one another</s>  as it was impossible however now to preventtheir coming lady middleton resigned herself to the idea of it withall the philosophy of a wellbred woman contenting herself with merelygiving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six timesevery day</s> the young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel orunfashionable</s>  their dress was very smart their manners very civilthey were delighted with the house and in raptures with the furnitureand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that ladymiddletons good opinion was engaged in their favour before they hadbeen an hour at the park</s>  she declared them to be very agreeable girlsindeed which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration</s>  sir johnsconfidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise and heset off directly for the cottage to tell the miss dashwoods of the misssteeles arrival and to assure them of their being the sweetest girlsin the world</s>  from such commendation as this however there was notmuch to be learned elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in theworld were to be met with in every part of england under everypossible variation of form face temper and understanding</s>  sir johnwanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at hisguests</s>  benevolent philanthropic man</s>  it was painful to him even tokeep a third cousin to himself</s> do come now said hepray comeyou must comei declare you shallcomeyou cant think how you will like them</s>  lucy is monstrouspretty and so good humoured and agreeable</s>  the children are allhanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance</s>  and theyboth long to see you of all things for they have heard at exeter thatyou are the most beautiful creatures in the world and i have told themit is all very true and a great deal more</s>  you will be delighted withthem i am sure</s>  they have brought the whole coach full of playthingsfor the children</s>  how can you be so cross as not to come</s>  why theyare your cousins you know after a fashion</s>  you are my cousins andthey are my wifes so you must be related</s> but sir john could not prevail</s>  he could only obtain a promise oftheir calling at the park within a day or two and then left them inamazement at their indifference to walk home and boast anew of theirattractions to the miss steeles as he had been already boasting of themiss steeles to them</s> when their promised visit to the park and consequent introduction tothese young ladies took place they found in the appearance of theeldest who was nearly thirty with a very plain and not a sensibleface nothing to admire but in the other who was not more than two orthree and twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her featureswere pretty and she had a sharp quick eye and a smartness of airwhich though it did not give actual elegance or grace gave distinctionto her person</s>  their manners were particularly civil and elinor soonallowed them credit for some kind of sense when she saw with whatconstant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeableto lady middleton</s>  with her children they were in continual rapturesextolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring theirwhims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunatedemands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration ofwhatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thingor in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which herappearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight</s> fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles a fondmother though in pursuit of praise for her children the mostrapacious of human beings is likewise the most credulous her demandsare exorbitant but she will swallow any thing and the excessiveaffection and endurance of the miss steeles towards her offspring wereviewed therefore by lady middleton without the smallest surprise ordistrust</s>  she saw with maternal complacency all the impertinentencroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted</s> she saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about their ears theirworkbags searched and their knives and scissors stolen away and feltno doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment</s>  it suggested no othersurprise than that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly bywithout claiming a share in what was passing</s> john is in such spirits today</s>  said she on his taking miss steelesspocket handkerchief and throwing it out of windowhe is full ofmonkey tricks</s> and soon afterwards on the second boys violently pinching one of thesame ladys fingers she fondly observed how playful william is</s> and here is my sweet little annamaria she added tenderly caressinga little girl of three years old who had not made a noise for the lasttwo minutes and she is always so gentle and quietnever was theresuch a quiet little thing</s> but unfortunately in bestowing these embraces a pin in her ladyshipshead dress slightly scratching the childs neck produced from thispattern of gentleness such violent screams as could hardly be outdoneby any creature professedly noisy</s>  the mothers consternation wasexcessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles andevery thing was done by all three in so critical an emergency whichaffection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the littlesufferer</s>  she was seated in her mothers lap covered with kisses herwound bathed with lavenderwater by one of the miss steeles who wason her knees to attend her and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums bythe other</s>  with such a reward for her tears the child was too wise tocease crying</s>  she still screamed and sobbed lustily kicked her twobrothers for offering to touch her and all their united soothings wereineffectual till lady middleton luckily remembering that in a scene ofsimilar distress last week some apricot marmalade had beensuccessfully applied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerlyproposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight intermission ofscreams in the young lady on hearing it gave them reason to hope thatit would not be rejected</s>  she was carried out of the room thereforein her mothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the two boyschose to follow though earnestly entreated by their mother to staybehind the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the roomhad not known for many hours</s> poor little creatures</s>  said miss steele as soon as they were gone</s> it might have been a very sad accident</s> yet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it had been undertotally different circumstances</s>  but this is the usual way ofheightening alarm where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality</s> what a sweet woman lady middleton is</s>  said lucy steele</s> marianne was silent it was impossible for her to say what she did notfeel however trivial the occasion and upon elinor therefore the wholetask of telling lies when politeness required it always fell</s>  she didher best when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton with morewarmth than she felt though with far less than miss lucy</s> and sir john too cried the elder sister what a charming man he is</s> here too miss dashwoods commendation being only simple and justcame in without any eclat</s>  she merely observed that he was perfectlygood humoured and friendly</s> and what a charming little family they have</s>  i never saw such finechildren in my life</s> i declare i quite doat upon them already andindeed i am always distractedly fond of children</s> i should guess so said elinor with a smile from what i havewitnessed this morning</s> i have a notion said lucy you think the little middletons rathertoo much indulged perhaps they may be the outside of enough but it isso natural in lady middleton and for my part i love to see childrenfull of life and spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame andquiet</s> i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i neverthink of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence</s> a short pause succeeded this speech which was first broken by misssteele who seemed very much disposed for conversation and who nowsaid rather abruptly and how do you like devonshire miss dashwood</s> i suppose you were very sorry to leave sussex</s> in some surprise at the familiarity of this question or at least ofthe manner in which it was spoken elinor replied that she was</s> norland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it</s>  added miss steele</s> we have heard sir john admire it excessively said lucy who seemedto think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister</s> i think every one must admire it replied elinor who ever saw theplace though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate itsbeauties as we do</s> and had you a great many smart beaux there</s>  i suppose you have not somany in this part of the world for my part i think they are a vastaddition always</s> but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed of her sisterthat there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex</s> nay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there ant</s>  imsure theres a vast many smart beaux in exeter but you know how couldi tell what smart beaux there might be about norland and i was onlyafraid the miss dashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had notso many as they used to have</s>  but perhaps you young ladies may notcare about the beaux and had as lief be without them as with them</s> for my part i think they are vastly agreeable provided they dresssmart and behave civil</s>  but i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty</s> now theres mr</s>  rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man quite abeau clerk to mr</s>  simpson you know and yet if you do but meet him ofa morning he is not fit to be seen</s>  i suppose your brother was quitea beau miss dashwood before he married as he was so rich</s> upon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you for i do notperfectly comprehend the meaning of the word</s>  but this i can say thatif he ever was a beau before he married he is one still for there isnot the smallest alteration in him</s> oh</s>  dear</s>  one never thinks of married mens being beauxthey havesomething else to do</s> lord</s>  anne cried her sister you can talk of nothing butbeauxyou will make miss dashwood believe you think of nothing else</s> and then to turn the discourse she began admiring the house and thefurniture</s> this specimen of the miss steeles was enough</s>  the vulgar freedom andfolly of the eldest left her no recommendation and as elinor was notblinded by the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest to her wantof real elegance and artlessness she left the house without any wishof knowing them better</s> not so the miss steeles</s> they came from exeter well provided withadmiration for the use of sir john middleton his family and all hisrelations and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his faircousins whom they declared to be the most beautiful elegantaccomplished and agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whomthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted</s>  and to bebetter acquainted therefore elinor soon found was their inevitablelot for as sir john was entirely on the side of the miss steelestheir party would be too strong for opposition and that kind ofintimacy must be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour or twotogether in the same room almost every day</s>  sir john could do no morebut he did not know that any more was required to be together was inhis opinion to be intimate and while his continual schemes for theirmeeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being establishedfriends</s> to do him justice he did every thing in his power to promote theirunreserve by making the miss steeles acquainted with whatever he knewor supposed of his cousins situations in the most delicateparticularsand elinor had not seen them more than twice before theeldest of them wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky asto make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to barton</s> twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure saidshe and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome</s>  and ihope you may have as good luck yourself soonbut perhaps you may havea friend in the corner already</s> elinor could not suppose that sir john would be more nice inproclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward than he had beenwith respect to marianne indeed it was rather his favourite joke ofthe two as being somewhat newer and more conjectural and sinceedwards visit they had never dined together without his drinking toher best affections with so much significancy and so many nods andwinks as to excite general attention</s>  the letter fhad been likewiseinvariably brought forward and found productive of such countlessjokes that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet hadbeen long established with elinor</s> the miss steeles as she expected had now all the benefit of thesejokes and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know thename of the gentleman alluded to which though often impertinentlyexpressed was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitivenessinto the concerns of their family</s>  but sir john did not sport longwith the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least asmuch pleasure in telling the name as miss steele had in hearing it</s> his name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper but pray donot tell it for its a great secret</s> ferrars</s>  repeated miss steele mr</s>  ferrars is the happy man is he</s> what</s>  your sisterinlaws brother miss dashwood</s>  a very agreeableyoung man to be sure i know him very well</s> how can you say so anne</s>  cried lucy who generally made an amendmentto all her sisters assertions</s>  though we have seen him once or twiceat my uncles it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well</s> elinor heard all this with attention and surprise</s>  and who was thisuncle</s>  where did he live</s>  how came they acquainted</s>  she wished verymuch to have the subject continued though she did not chuse to join init herself but nothing more of it was said and for the first time inher life she thought mrs</s>  jennings deficient either in curiosity afterpetty information or in a disposition to communicate it</s>  the mannerin which miss steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity forit struck her as being rather illnatured and suggested the suspicionof that ladys knowing or fancying herself to know something to hisdisadvantage</s> but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther noticewas taken of mr</s>  ferrarss name by miss steele when alluded to or evenopenly mentioned by sir john</s> chapter 22marianne who had never much toleration for any thing likeimpertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference oftaste from herself was at this time particularly illdisposed fromthe state of her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles or toencourage their advances and to the invariable coldness of herbehaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy ontheir side elinor principally attributed that preference of herselfwhich soon became evident in the manners of both but especially oflucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or ofstriving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frankcommunication of her sentiments</s> lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often just and amusing andas a companion for half an hour elinor frequently found her agreeablebut her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant andilliterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want ofinformation in the most common particulars could not be concealed frommiss dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear toadvantage</s>  elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilitieswhich education might have rendered so respectable but she saw withless tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy ofrectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions herassiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed and she could have nolasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insinceritywith ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting inconversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others madeevery shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectlyvalueless</s> you will think my question an odd one i dare say said lucy to herone day as they were walking together from the park to thecottagebut pray are you personally acquainted with yoursisterinlaws mother mrs</s>  ferrars</s> elinor did think the question a very odd one and her countenanceexpressed it as she answered that she had never seen mrs</s>  ferrars</s> indeed</s>  replied lucy i wonder at that for i thought you must haveseen her at norland sometimes</s>  then perhaps you cannot tell me whatsort of a woman she is</s> no returned elinor cautious of giving her real opinion of edwardsmother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinentcuriosity i know nothing of her</s> i am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such away said lucy eyeing elinor attentively as she spoke but perhapsthere may be reasonsi wish i might venture but however i hope youwill do me the justice of believing that i do not mean to beimpertinent</s> elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes insilence</s>  it was broken by lucy who renewed the subject again bysaying with some hesitationi cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious</s>  i am sure iwould rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a personwhose good opinion is so well worth having as yours</s>  and i am sure ishould not have the smallest fear of trusting you indeed i should bevery glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortablesituation as i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you</s> i am sorry you do not happen to know mrs</s>  ferrars</s> i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment if it couldbe of any use to you to know my opinion of her</s>  but really i neverunderstood that you were at all connected with that family andtherefore i am a little surprised i confess at so serious an inquiryinto her character</s> i dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all wonder at it</s>  butif i dared tell you all you would not be so much surprised</s>  mrs</s> ferrars is certainly nothing to me at presentbut the time maycomehow soon it will come must depend upon herselfwhen we may bevery intimately connected</s> she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one sideglance at her companion to observe its effect on her</s> good heavens</s>  cried elinor what do you mean</s>  are you acquaintedwith mr</s>  robert ferrars</s>  can you be</s>  and she did not feel muchdelighted with the idea of such a sisterinlaw</s> no replied lucy not to mr</s>  robert ferrarsi never saw him in mylife but fixing her eyes upon elinor to his eldest brother</s> what felt elinor at that moment</s>  astonishment that would have been aspainful as it was strong had not an immediate disbelief of theassertion attended it</s>  she turned towards lucy in silent amazementunable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and thoughher complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in nodanger of an hysterical fit or a swoon</s> you may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure you couldhave had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped thesmallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was alwaysmeant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept soby me to this hour</s>  not a soul of all my relations know of it butanne and i never should have mentioned it to you if i had not feltthe greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy and i reallythought my behaviour in asking so many questions about mrs</s>  ferrarsmust seem so odd that it ought to be explained</s>  and i do not thinkmr</s>  ferrars can be displeased when he knows i have trusted youbecause i know he has the highest opinion in the world of all yourfamily and looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite ashis own sisters</s> she paused</s> elinor for a few moments remained silent</s>  her astonishment at what sheheard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herselfto speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of mannerwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude may i askif your engagement is of long standing</s>
we have been engaged these four years</s> four years</s> yes</s> elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it</s> i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till theother day</s> our acquaintance however is of many years date</s>  he was under myuncles care you know a considerable while</s> your uncle</s> yes mr</s>  pratt</s>  did you never hear him talk of mr</s>  pratt</s> i think i have replied elinor with an exertion of spirits whichincreased with her increase of emotion</s> he was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple nearplymouth</s>  it was there our acquaintance begun for my sister and mewas often staying with my uncle and it was there our engagement wasformed though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil but hewas almost always with us afterwards</s>
 i was very unwilling to enterinto it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation ofhis mother but i was too young and loved him too well to be soprudent as i ought to have been</s>  though you do not know him so wellas me miss dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensiblehe is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him</s> certainly answered elinor without knowing what she said but aftera moments reflection she added with revived security of edwardshonour and love and her companions falsehoodengaged to mr</s>  edwardferrars</s> i confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell methat reallyi beg your pardon but surely there must be some mistakeof person or name</s>
 we cannot mean the same mr</s>  ferrars</s> we can mean no other cried lucy smiling</s>  mr</s>

no considering our situation it was not strange</s>  our first care hasbeen to keep the matter secret</s>  you knew nothing of me or my familyand therefore there could be no occasion for ever mentioning my nameto you and as he was always particularly afraid of his sisterssuspecting any thing that was reason enough for his not mentioning it</s> she was silent</s> elinors security sunk but her selfcommand did notsink with it</s> four years you have been engaged said she with a firm voice</s> yes and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait</s>  pooredward</s>  it puts him quite

think you cannot be deceived as to the person it wasdrew for</s> i have had it above these three years</s> she put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor saw thepainting whatever other doubts

of your faithfullykeeping this secret because you must know of what importance it is tous not to have it reach his mother for she would never approve of iti dare say</s>  i shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceedingproud woman</s> i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor but you do meno more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on</s>  yoursecret is safe with me but pardon me if i express some surprise at sounnecessary a communication</s>  you must at least have felt that my beingacquainted with it could not add to its safety</s> as she said this she looked earnestly at lucy hoping to discoversomething in her countenance perhaps the falsehood of the greatestpart of what she had been saying but lucys countenance suffered nochange</s> i was afraid you would think i was taking a great liberty with yousaid she in telling you all this</s>  i have not known you long to besure personally at least but i have known you and all your family bydescription a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost asif you was an old acquaintance</s>  besides in the present case i reallythought some explanation was due to you after my making such particularinquiries about edwards mother and i am so unfortunate that i havenot a creature whose advice i can ask</s>  anne is the only person thatknows of it and she has no judgment at all indeed she does me agreat deal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of herbetraying me</s>  she does not know how to hold her tongue as you mustperceive and i am sure i was in the greatest fright in the worldtother day when edwards name was mentioned by sir john lest sheshould out with it all</s>  you cant think how much i go through in mymind from it altogether</s>  i only wonder that i am alive after what ihave suffered for edwards sake these last four years</s>  every thing insuch suspense and uncertainty and seeing him so seldomwe can hardlymeet above twice ayear</s>  i am sure i wonder my heart is not quitebroke</s> here she took out her handkerchief but elinor did not feel verycompassionate</s> sometimes</s>  continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether itwould not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely</s>  asshe said this she looked directly at her companion</s>  but then atother times i have not resolution enough for it</s>  i cannot bear thethoughts of making him so miserable as i know the very mention of sucha thing would do</s>  and on my own account tooso dear as he is to meidont think i could be equal to it</s>  what would you advise me to do insuch a case miss dashwood</s>  what would you do yourself</s> pardon me replied elinor startled by the question but i can giveyou no advice under such circumstances</s>  your own judgment must directyou</s> to be sure continued lucy after a few minutes silence on bothsides his mother must provide for him sometime or other but pooredward is so cast down by it</s>  did you not think him dreadfullowspirited when he was at barton</s>  he was so miserable when he leftus at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think himquite ill</s> did he come from your uncles then when he visited us</s> oh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us</s>  did you think hecame directly from town</s> no replied elinor most feelingly sensible of every freshcircumstance in favour of lucys veracity i remember he told us thathe had been staying a fortnight with some friends near plymouth</s>  sheremembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothingfarther of those friends at his total silence with respect even totheir names</s> did not you think him sadly out of spirits</s>  repeated lucy</s> we did indeed particularly so when he first arrived</s> i begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was thematter but it made him so melancholy not being able to stay more thana fortnight with us and seeing me so much affected</s>  poor fellow</s> iam afraid it is just the same with him now for he writes in wretchedspirits</s>  i heard from him just before i left exeter taking a letterfrom her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor</s>  youknow his hand i dare say a charming one it is but that is notwritten so well as usual</s> he was tired i dare say for he had justfilled the sheet to me as full as possible</s> elinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt no longer</s>  thispicture she had allowed herself to believe might have beenaccidentally obtained it might not have been edwards gift but acorrespondence between them by letter could subsist only under apositive engagement could be authorised by nothing else for a fewmoments she was almost overcomeher heart sunk within her and shecould hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary and shestruggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings thather success was speedy and for the time complete</s> writing to each other said lucy returning the letter into herpocket is the only comfort we have in such long separations</s>  yes ihave one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not eventhat</s>  if he had but my picture he says he should be easy</s>  i gave hima lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at longstaple last andthat was some comfort to him he said but not equal to a picture</s> perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him</s> i did said elinor with a composure of voice under which wasconcealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever feltbefore</s>  she was mortified shocked confounded</s> fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and theconversation could be continued no farther</s>  after sitting with them afew minutes the miss steeles returned to the park and elinor was thenat liberty to think and be wretched</s>
chapter 23however small elinors general dependence on lucys veracity might beit was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in thepresent case where no temptation could be answerable to the folly ofinventing a falsehood of such a description</s>  what lucy had asserted tobe true therefore elinor could not dared not longer doubt supportedas it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs andcontradicted by nothing but her own wishes</s>  their opportunity ofacquaintance in the house of mr</s>  pratt was a foundation for the restat once indisputable and alarming and edwards visit near plymouthhis melancholy state of mind his dissatisfaction at his own prospectshis uncertain behaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of themiss steeles as to norland and their family connections which hadoften surprised her the picture the letter the ring formedaltogether such a body of evidence as overcame every fear ofcondemning him unfairly and established as a fact which no partialitycould set aside his illtreatment of herself</s> her resentment of suchbehaviour her indignation at having been its dupe for a short timemade her feel only for herself but other ideas other considerationssoon arose</s>  had edward been intentionally deceiving her</s>  had hefeigned a regard for her which he did not feel</s>  was his engagement tolucy an engagement of the heart</s>  no whatever it might once have beenshe could not believe it such at present</s>  his affection was all herown</s>  she could not be deceived in that</s>  her mother

much could it not tempt her toforgive</s>  he had been blamable highly blamable in remaining atnorland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than itought to be</s>  in that he could not be defended but if he had injuredher how much more had he injured himself if her case were pitiablehis was hopeless</s>  his imprudence had made her miserable for a whilebut it seemed to have

were his affection for herself out of the question with hisintegrity his delicacy and wellinformed mind be satisfied with awife like herilliterate artful and selfish</s> the youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to everything but her beauty and good nature but the four succeedingyearsyears which if rationally spent give such improvement to theunderstanding must have opened his eyes to her defects of educationwhile the same period of time spent on her side in inferior societyand more frivolous pursuits had perhaps robbed her of that simplicitywhich might once have given an interesting character to her beauty</s> if in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself his difficultiesfrom his mother had seemed great how much greater were they now likelyto be when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior inconnections and probably inferior in fortune to herself</s>  thesedifficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might notpress very hard upon his patience but melancholy was the state of theperson by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindnesscould be felt as a relief</s> as these considerations occurred to her in painful succession she weptfor him more than for herself</s>  supported by the conviction of havingdone nothing to merit her present unhappiness and consoled by thebelief that edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem she thoughtshe could even now under the first smart of the heavy blow commandherself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her motherand sisters</s>  and so well was she able to answer her own expectationsthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had firstsuffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would havesupposed from the appearance of the sisters that elinor was mourningin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the objectof her love and that marianne was internally dwelling on theperfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughlypossessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drovenear their house</s> the necessity of concealing from her mother and marianne what had beenentrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasingexertion was no aggravation of elinors distress</s>  on the contrary itwas a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would givesuch affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing thatcondemnation of edward which would probably flow from the excess oftheir partial affection for herself and which was more than she feltequal to support</s> from their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receiveno assistance their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distresswhile her selfcommand would neither receive encouragement from theirexample nor from their praise</s>  she was stronger alone and her owngood sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshakenher appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets sopoignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be</s> much as she had suffered from her first conversation with lucy on thesubject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this formore reasons than one</s>  she wanted to hear many particulars of theirengagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand whatlucy really felt for edward whether there were any sincerity in herdeclaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted toconvince lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and hercalmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested init than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntaryagitation in their morning discourse must have left at leastdoubtful</s>  that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared veryprobable it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in herpraise not merely from lucys assertion but from her venturing totrust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret soconfessedly and evidently important</s>  and even sir johns jokingintelligence must have had some weight</s>  but indeed while elinorremained so well assured within herself of being really beloved byedward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make itnatural that lucy should be jealous and that she was so her veryconfidence was a proof</s>  what other reason for the disclosure of theaffair could there be but that elinor might be informed by it oflucys superior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him in future</s> she had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rivalsintentions and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as everyprinciple of honour and honesty directed to combat her own affectionfor edward and to see him as little as possible she could not denyherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy that her heart wasunwounded</s>  and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear onthe subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her ownability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure</s> but it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could becommanded though lucy was as well disposed as herself to takeadvantage of any that occurred for the weather was not often fineenough to allow of their joining in a walk where they might mosteasily separate themselves from the others and though they met atleast every other evening either at the park or cottage and chiefly atthe former they could not be supposed to meet for the sake ofconversation</s>  such a thought would never enter either sir john or ladymiddletons head and therefore very little leisure was ever given fora general chat and none at all for particular discourse</s>  they met forthe sake of eating drinking and laughing together playing at cardsor consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy</s> one or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affordingelinor any chance of engaging lucy in private when sir john called atthe cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that theywould all dine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged toattend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be quite aloneexcept her mother and the two miss steeles</s>  elinor who foresaw afairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as thiswas likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquiland wellbred direction of lady middleton than when her husband unitedthem together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted theinvitation margaret with her mothers permission was equallycompliant and marianne though always unwilling to join any of theirparties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have herseclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise</s> the young ladies went and lady middleton was happily preserved fromthe frightful solitude which had threatened her</s>  the insipidity of themeeting was exactly such as elinor had expected it produced not onenovelty of thought or expression and nothing could be less interestingthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour anddrawing room to the latter the children accompanied them and whilethey remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility ofengaging lucys attention to attempt it</s>  they quitted it only with theremoval of the teathings</s>  the cardtable was then placed and elinorbegan to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope offinding time for conversation at the park</s>  they all rose up inpreparation for a round game</s> i am glad said lady middleton to lucy you are not going to finishpoor little annamarias basket this evening for i am sure it must hurtyour eyes to work filigree by candlelight</s>  and we will make the dearlittle love some amends for her disappointment tomorrow and then ihope she will not much mind it</s> this hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly and repliedindeed you are very much mistaken lady middleton i am only waitingto know whether you can make your party without me or i should havebeen at my filigree already</s>  i would not disappoint the little angelfor all the world and if you want me at the cardtable now i amresolved to finish the basket after supper</s> you are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyeswill you ring thebell for some working candles</s>  my poor little girl would be sadlydisappointed i know if the basket was not finished tomorrow forthough i told her it certainly would not i am sure she depends uponhaving it done</s> lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with analacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste nogreater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child</s> lady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others</s>  no one madeany objection but marianne who with her usual inattention to the formsof general civility exclaimed your ladyship will have the goodnessto excuse meyou know i detest cards</s>  i shall go to the pianofortei have not touched it since it was tuned</s>  and without fartherceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument</s> lady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that she had never madeso rude a speech</s> marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know maamsaid elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence and i do notmuch wonder at it for it is the very best toned pianoforte i everheard</s> the remaining five were now to draw their cards</s> perhaps continued elinor if i should happen to cut out i may beof some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her andthere is so much still to be done to the basket that it must beimpossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening</s>  ishould like the work exceedingly if she would allow me a share in it</s> indeed i shall be very much obliged to you for your help cried lucyfor i find there is more to be done to it than i thought there wasand it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria afterall</s> oh</s>  that would be terrible indeed said miss steele dear littlesoul how i do love her</s> you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor and as you reallylike the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in tillanother rubber or will you take your chance now</s> elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by alittle of that address which marianne could never condescend topractise gained her own end and pleased lady middleton at the sametime</s>  lucy made room for her with ready attention and the two fairrivals were thus seated side by side at the same table and with theutmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work</s>  the pianoforte atwhich marianne wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts hadby this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herselfwas luckily so near them that miss dashwood now judged she mightsafely under the shelter of its noise introduce the interestingsubject without any risk of being heard at the cardtable</s> chapter 24in a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began</s> i should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me withif i felt no desire for its continuance or no farther curiosity on itssubject</s>  i will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again</s> thank you cried lucy warmly for breaking the ice you have set myheart at ease by it for i was somehow or other afraid i had offendedyou by what i told you that monday</s> offended me</s>  how could you suppose so</s>  believe me and elinor spokeit with the truest sincerity nothing could be farther from myintention than to give you such an idea</s>  could you have a motive forthe trust that was not honourable and flattering to me</s> and yet i do assure you replied lucy her little sharp eyes full ofmeaning there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in yourmanner that made me quite uncomfortable</s>  i felt sure that you wasangry with me and have been quarrelling with myself ever since forhaving took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs</s>  but i amvery glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do notblame me</s>  if you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve myheart speaking to you of what i am always thinking of every moment ofmy life your compassion would make you overlook every thing else i amsure</s> indeed i can easily believe that it was a very great relief to youto acknowledge your situation to me and be assured that you shallnever have reason to repent it</s>  your case is a very unfortunate oneyou seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties and you will haveneed of all your mutual affection to support you under them</s>  mr</s> ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother</s> he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness tomarry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospectof more without a sigh</s>  i have been always used to a very smallincome and could struggle with any poverty for him but i love him toowell to be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that hismother might give him if he married to please her</s>  we must wait itmay be for many years</s>  with almost every other man in the world itwould be an alarming prospect but edwards affection and constancynothing can deprive me of i know</s> that conviction must be every thing to you and he is undoubtedlysupported by the same trust in yours</s>  if the strength of yourreciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and undermany circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagementyour situation would have been pitiable indeed</s> lucy here looked up but elinor was careful in guarding her countenancefrom every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency</s> edwards love for me said lucy has been pretty well put to thetest by our long very long absence since we were first engaged andit has stood the trial so well that i should be unpardonable to doubtit now</s>  i can safely say that he has never gave me one moments alarmon that account from the first</s> elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion</s> lucy went on</s>  i am rather of a jealous temper too by nature and fromour different situations in life from his being so much more in theworld than me and our continual separation i was enough inclined forsuspicion to have found out the truth in an instant if there had beenthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met or anylowness of spirits that i could not account for or if he had talkedmore of one lady than another or seemed in any respect less happy atlongstaple than he used to be</s>  i do not mean to say that i amparticularly observant or quicksighted in general but in such a casei am sure i could not be deceived</s> all this thought elinor is very pretty but it can impose uponneither of us</s> but what said she after a short silence are your views</s>  or haveyou none but that of waiting for mrs</s>  ferrarss death which is amelancholy and shocking extremity</s> is her son determined to submit tothis and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in whichit may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for awhile by owning the truth</s> if we could be certain that it would be only for a while</s>  but mrs</s> ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman and in her first fit of angerupon hearing it would very likely secure every thing to robert andthe idea of that for edwards sake frightens away all my inclinationfor hasty measures</s> and for your own sake too or you are carrying your disinterestednessbeyond reason</s> lucy looked at elinor again and was silent</s> do you know mr</s>  robert ferrars</s>  asked elinor</s> not at alli never saw him but i fancy he is very unlike hisbrothersilly and a great coxcomb</s> a great coxcomb</s>  repeated miss steele whose ear had caught thosewords by a sudden pause in mariannes music</s>  oh they are talking oftheir favourite beaux i dare say</s> no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beauxare not great coxcombs</s> i can answer for it that miss dashwoods is not said mrs</s>  jenningslaughing heartily for he is one of the modestest prettiest behavedyoung men i ever saw but as for lucy she is such a sly littlecreature there is no finding out who she likes</s> oh cried miss steele looking significantly round at them i daresay lucys beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as missdashwoods</s> elinor blushed in spite of herself</s>  lucy bit her lip and lookedangrily at her sister</s>  a mutual silence took place for some time</s> lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone though mariannewas then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificentconcertoi will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into myhead for bringing matters to bear indeed i am bound to let you intothe secret for you are a party concerned</s>  i dare say you have seenenough of edward to know that he would prefer the church to every otherprofession now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as hecan and then through your interest which i am sure you would be kindenough to use out of friendship for him and i hope out of some regardto me your brother might be persuaded to give him norland livingwhich i understand is a very good one and the present incumbent notlikely to live a great while</s>  that would be enough for us to marryupon and we might trust to time and chance for the rest</s> i should always be happy replied elinor to show any mark of myesteem and friendship for mr</s>  ferrars but do you not perceive that myinterest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary</s>  he isbrother to mrs</s>  john dashwoodthat must be recommendation enough toher husband</s> but mrs</s>  john dashwood would not much approve of edwards going intoorders</s> then i rather suspect that my interest would do very little</s> they were again silent for many minutes</s>  at length lucy exclaimed witha deep sighi believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business atonce by dissolving the engagement</s>  we seem so beset with difficultieson every side that though it would make us miserable for a time weshould be happier perhaps in the end</s>  but you will not give me youradvice miss dashwood</s> no answered elinor with a smile which concealed very agitatedfeelings on such a subject i certainly will not</s>  you know very wellthat my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on theside of your wishes</s> indeed you wrong me replied lucy with great solemnity i knownobody of whose judgment i think so highly as i do of yours and i doreally believe that if you was to say to me i advise you by allmeans to put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars it will bemore for the happiness of both of you i should resolve upon doing itimmediately</s> elinor blushed for the insincerity of edwards future wife andreplied this compliment would effectually frighten me from giving anyopinion on the subject had i formed one</s>  it raises my influence muchtoo high the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is toomuch for an indifferent person</s> tis because you are an indifferent person said lucy with somepique and laying a particular stress on those words that yourjudgment might justly have such weight with me</s>  if you could besupposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinionwould not be worth having</s> elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this lest they mightprovoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve andwas even partly determined never to mention the subject again</s>  anotherpause therefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech andlucy was still the first to end it</s> shall you be in town this winter miss dashwood</s>  said she with allher accustomary complacency</s> certainly not</s> i am sorry for that returned the other while her eyes brightened atthe information it would have gave me such pleasure to meet youthere</s>  but i dare say you will go for all that</s>  to be sure yourbrother and sister will ask you to come to them</s> it will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do</s> how unlucky that is</s>  i had quite depended upon meeting you there</s> anne and me are to go the latter end of january to some relations whohave been wanting us to visit them these several years</s>  but i only gofor the sake of seeing edward</s>  he will be there in february otherwiselondon would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it</s> elinor was soon called to the cardtable by the conclusion of the firstrubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was thereforeat an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance fornothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each otherless than they had done before and elinor sat down to the card tablewith the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only withoutaffection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had noteven the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincereaffection on her side would have given for selfinterest alone couldinduce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed sothoroughly aware that he was weary</s> from this time the subject was never revived by elinor and whenentered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing itand was particularly careful to inform her confidante of her happinesswhenever she received a letter from edward it was treated by theformer with calmness and caution and dismissed as soon as civilitywould allow for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence whichlucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself</s> the visit of the miss steeles at barton park was lengthened far beyondwhat the first invitation implied</s>  their favour increased they couldnot be spared sir john would not hear of their going and in spite oftheir numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter in spite of theabsolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately which wasin full force at the end of every week they were prevailed on to staynearly two months at the park and to assist in the due celebration ofthat festival which requires a more than ordinary share of privateballs and large dinners to proclaim its importance</s> chapter 25though mrs</s>  jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion ofthe year at the houses of her children and friends she was not withouta settled habitation of her own</s>  since the death of her husband whohad traded with success in a less elegant part of the town she hadresided every winter in a house in one of the streets near portmansquare</s>  towards this home she began on the approach of january toturn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly and veryunexpectedly by them asked the elder misses dashwood to accompany her</s> elinor without observing the varying complexion of her sister and theanimated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gavea grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herselfto be speaking their united inclinations</s>  the reason alleged was theirdetermined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of theyear</s>  mrs</s>  jennings received the refusal with some surprise andrepeated her invitation immediately</s> oh lord</s>  i am sure your mother can spare you very well and i do begyou will favour me with your company for ive

marianne would not objectto such a scheme if her elder sister would come into it</s>  it is veryhard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure because missdashwood does not wish it</s>  so i would advise you two to set off fortown when you are tired of barton without saying a word to missdashwood about it</s> nay cried mrs</s>  jennings i am sure i shall be monstrous glad ofmiss mariannes

indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by hereagerness to be with willoughby again made no farther directopposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mothersdecision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive anysupport in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could notapprove of for marianne and which on her own account she hadparticular reasons to avoid</s>  whatever marianne was desirous of hermother would be eager to promoteshe could not expect to influence thelatter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she hadnever been able to

dislike of mrs</s>  jennings saidmarianne at least it need not prevent my accepting her invitation</s>  ihave no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with everyunpleasantness of that kind with very little effort</s> elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towardsthe manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty inpersuading marianne to behave with tolerable politeness and resolvedwithin herself that if her sister persisted in going she would golikewise as she did not think it proper that marianne should be leftto the sole guidance of her own judgment or that mrs</s>  jennings shouldbe abandoned to the mercy of marianne for all the comfort of herdomestic hours</s>  to this determination she was the more easilyreconciled by recollecting that edward

these objections arenonsensical</s>  you will have much pleasure in being in london andespecially in being together and if elinor would ever condescend toanticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety ofsources she would perhaps expect some from improving heracquaintance with her sisterinlaws family</s> elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken hermothers dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that theshock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on thisattack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to beginher design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrarsvery much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest ofthe family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i amever known to them or not</s> mrs</s>  dashwood smiled and said nothing</s>  marianne lifted up her eyes inastonishment and elinor conjectured that she might as well have heldher

been so happy intheir lives as this intelligence made them</s> elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes withless reluctance than she had expected to feel</s>  with regard to herselfit was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not andwhen she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and hersister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to allher usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety shecould not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allowherself to distrust the consequence</s> mariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness so great was theperturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone</s>  herunwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmnessand at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive</s> her mothers affliction was hardly less and elinor was the only one ofthe three who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short ofeternal</s>

writing home marianne said elinor had not youbetter defer your letter for a day or two</s> i am not going to write to my mother replied marianne hastily andas if wishing to avoid any farther

in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone hersister then left her and while she waited the return of mrs</s>  jenningshad leisure enough for thinking over the past</s> that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby andmarianne she could not doubt and that willoughby was weary of itseemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed her ownwishes she could not

a returnof the same excessive affliction</s>  it was some minutes before she couldgo on with her letter and the frequent bursts of grief which stillobliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough ofher feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for thelast time to willoughby</s> elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power andshe would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had notmarianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervousirritability not to speak to her for the world</s>  in suchcircumstances it was better for both that they should not be longtogether and the restless state of mariannes mind not only preventedher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed butrequiring at once solitude and continual change of place made herwander about the house till breakfast time avoiding the sight of everybody</s> at breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any thing andelinors

never less disposed to speak than at that momentobliged herself to answer such an attack as this and thereforetrying to smile replied and have you really maam talked yourselfinto a persuasion of my sisters being engaged to mr</s>  willoughby</s>  ithought it had been only a joke but so serious a question seems toimply more and i must beg therefore that you will not deceiveyourself any longer</s>

laying by her</s>  elinor drew near but withoutsaying a word and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissedher affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst oftears which at first was scarcely less violent than mariannes</s>  thelatter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness ofthis behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction sheput all the letters into elinors hands and then covering her facewith her handkerchief almost screamed with agony</s>  elinor who knewthat such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have itscourse watched by her

shall never reflect on  my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire  without the most grateful pleasure and flatter  myself it will not be broken by any mistake or  misapprehension of my

letter as this must be read by missdashwood may be imagined</s>  though aware before she began it that itmust bring a confession of his inconstancy and confirm theirseparation for ever she was not aware that such language could besuffered to announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby capableof departing so far from the appearance of every honourable anddelicate feelingso far from the common decorum of a gentleman as tosend a letter so impudently cruel a letter which instead of bringingwith his desire of a release any professions of regret acknowledged nobreach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatevera letter ofwhich every line was an insult and which proclaimed its writer to bedeep in hardened villainy</s> she paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment then readit again and again but every perusal only served to increase herabhorrence of the man and so bitter were her feelings against himthat she dared not trust herself to speak lest she might woundmarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement not as a loss toher of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and mostirremediable of all evils a connection for life with an unprincipledman as a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important</s> in her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter on thedepravity of that mind which could dictate it and probably on thevery different mind of a very different person who had no otherconnection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him withevery thing that passed elinor forgot the immediate distress of hersister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread and soentirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearinga carriage drive up to the door she went to

thoroughly goodhumoured concern forits cause admitted the excuse most readily and elinor after seeingher safe off returned to marianne whom she found attempting to risefrom the bed and whom she reached just in time to prevent her fromfalling on the floor faint and giddy from a long want of proper restand food for it was many days since she had any appetite and manynights since she had really slept and now when her mind was no longersupported by the fever of suspense the consequence of all this wasfelt in an aching head a weakened stomach and a general nervousfaintness</s>  a glass of wine

theyare sure i have made a conquest but for my part i declare i neverthink about him from one hours end to another</s>  lord</s>  here comes yourbeau nancy my cousin said tother day when she saw him crossing thestreet to the house</s>  my beau indeed</s>  said ii cannot think who youmean</s>  the doctor is no beau of mine</s> aye aye that is very pretty talkingbut it wont dothe doctor isthe man i see</s> no indeed</s>  replied her cousin with affected earnestness and i begyou will contradict it if you ever hear it talked of</s> mrs</s>  jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that shecertainly would not and miss steele was made completely happy</s> i suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister missdashwood when they come to town said lucy returning after acessation of hostile hints to the charge</s> no i do not think we shall</s> oh yes i dare say you will</s> elinor would not humour her by farther opposition</s> what a charming thing it is that mrs</s>  dashwood can spare you both forso long a time together</s> long a time indeed</s>  interposed mrs</s>  jennings</s>  why their visit isbut just begun</s> lucy was silenced</s> i am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood said misssteele</s>  i am sorry she is not well for marianne had left the roomon their arrival</s> you are very good</s>  my sister will be equally sorry to miss

lucy andme</s> i think she might see us and i am sure we would not speak a word</s> elinor with great civility declined the proposal</s>  her sister wasperhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and thereforenot able to come to them</s> oh if thats all cried miss steele we can just as well go and seeher</s> elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper but shewas saved the trouble of checking it by lucys sharp reprimand whichnow as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to themanners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other</s> chapter 33after some opposition marianne yielded to her sisters entreaties andconsented to go out with her and mrs</s>  jennings one morning for half anhour</s>  she expressly conditioned however for paying no visits andwould do no more than accompany them to grays in sackville streetwhere elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a fewoldfashioned jewels of her mother</s> when they stopped at the door mrs</s>  jennings recollected that there wasa lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and asshe had no business at grays it was resolved that while her youngfriends transacted theirs she should pay her visit and return forthem</s> on ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found so many people beforethem in the room that there was not a person at liberty to tend totheir orders and they were obliged to wait</s>  all that could be donewas to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise thequickest succession one gentleman only was standing there and it isprobable that elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness toa quicker despatch</s>  but the correctness of his eye and the delicacyof his taste proved to be beyond his politeness</s>  he was giving ordersfor a toothpickcase for himself and till its size shape andornaments were determined all of which after examining and debatingfor a quarter of an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop werefinally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had no leisure tobestow any other attention on the two ladies than what was comprisedin three or four very broad stares a kind of notice which served toimprint on elinor the remembrance of a person and face of strongnatural sterling insignificance though adorned in the first style offashion</s> marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt andresentment on this impertinent examination of their features and onthe puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors ofthe different toothpickcases presented to his inspection by remainingunconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect her thoughtswithin herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her inmr</s>  grays shop as in her own bedroom</s> at last the affair was decided</s>  the ivory the gold and the pearlsall received their appointment and the gentleman having named the lastday on which his existence could be continued without the possession ofthe toothpickcase drew on his gloves with leisurely care andbestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such a one asseemed rather to demand than express admiration walked off with ahappy air of real conceit and affected indifference</s> elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward was on the pointof concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side</s> she turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surpriseto be her brother</s> their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a verycreditable appearance in mr</s>  grays shop</s>  john dashwood was really farfrom being sorry to see his sisters again it rather gave themsatisfaction and his inquiries after their mother were respectful andattentive</s> elinor found that he and fanny had been in town two days</s> i wished very much to call upon you yesterday said he but it wasimpossible for we were obliged to take harry to see the wild beasts atexeter exchange and we spent the rest of the day with mrs</s>  ferrars</s> harry was vastly pleased</s>  this morning i had fully intended to call onyou if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always somuch to do on first coming to town</s>  i am come here to bespeak fanny aseal</s>  but tomorrow i think i shall certainly be able to call inberkeley street and be introduced to your friend mrs</s>  jennings</s>  iunderstand she is a woman of very good fortune</s>  and the middletonstoo you must introduce me to them</s>  as my motherinlaws relations ishall be happy to show them every respect</s>  they are excellentneighbours to you in the country i understand</s> excellent indeed</s>  their attention to our comfort their friendlinessin every particular is more than i can express</s> i am extremely glad to hear it upon my word extremely glad indeed</s> but so it ought to be they are people of large fortune they arerelated to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve tomake your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected</s>  and so youare most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want fornothing</s>  edward brought us a most charming account of the place themost complete thing of its kind he said that ever was and you allseemed to enjoy it beyond any thing</s>  it was a great satisfaction to usto hear it i assure you</s> elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry tobe spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of mrs</s> jenningss servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited forthem at the door</s> mr</s>  dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to mrs</s>  jenningsat the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able tocall on them the next day took leave</s> his visit was duly paid</s>  he came with a pretence at an apology fromtheir sisterinlaw for not coming too but she was so much engagedwith her mother that really she had no leisure for going any where</s> mrs</s>  jennings however assured him directly that she should not standupon ceremony for they were all cousins or something like it and sheshould certainly wait on mrs</s>  john dashwood very soon and bring hersisters to see her</s>  his manners to them though calm were perfectlykind to mrs</s>  jennings most attentively civil and on colonelbrandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a curiositywhich seemed to say that he only wanted to know him to be rich to beequally civil to him</s> after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with himto conduit street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton</s> the weather was remarkably fine and she readily consented</s>  as soon asthey were out of the house his enquiries began</s> who is colonel brandon</s>  is he a man of fortune</s> yes he has very good property in dorsetshire</s> i am glad of it</s>  he seems a most gentlemanlike man and i thinkelinor i may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectableestablishment in life</s> me brother</s>
he likes you</s>  i observed him narrowly and am convinced of it</s>  whatis the amount of his fortune</s> i believe about two thousand a year</s> two thousand ayear and then working himself up to a pitch ofenthusiastic generosity he added elinor i wish with all my heart itwere twice as much for your sake</s> indeed i believe you replied elinor but i am very sure thatcolonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me</s> you are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken</s>  a very littletrouble on your side secures him</s>  perhaps just at present he may beundecided the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back hisfriends may all advise him against it</s>  but some of those littleattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fixhim in spite of himself</s>  and there can be no reason why you shouldnot try for him</s>  it is not to be supposed that any prior attachment onyour sidein short you know as to an attachment of that kind it isquite out of the question the objections are insurmountableyou havetoo much sense not to see all that</s>  colonel brandon must be the manand no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased withyou and your family</s>  it is a match that must give universalsatisfaction</s>  in short it is a kind of thing thatlowering hisvoice to an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome to allparties</s>  recollecting himself however he added that is i mean tosayyour friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fannyparticularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assureyou</s>  and her mother too mrs</s>  ferrars a very goodnatured woman i amsure it would give her great pleasure she said as much the other day</s> elinor would not vouchsafe any answer</s> it would be something remarkable now he continued somethingdroll if fanny should have a brother and i a sister settling at thesame time</s>  and yet it is not very unlikely</s> is mr</s>  edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to bemarried</s> it is not actually settled but there is such a thing in agitation</s> he has a most excellent mother</s>  mrs</s>  ferrars with the utmostliberality will come forward and settle on him a thousand a year ifthe match takes place</s>  the lady is the hon</s>  miss morton only daughterof the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds</s>  a very desirableconnection on both sides and i have not a doubt of its taking place intime</s>  a thousand ayear is a great deal for a mother to give away tomake over for ever but mrs</s>  ferrars has a noble spirit</s>  to give youanother instance of her liberalitythe other day as soon as we cameto town aware that money could not be very plenty with us just nowshe put banknotes into fannys hands to the amount of two hundredpounds</s>  and extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a greatexpense while we are here</s> he paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to sayyour expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerablebut your income is a large one</s> not so large i dare say as many people suppose</s>  i do not mean tocomplain however it is undoubtedly a comfortable one and i hope willin time be better</s>  the enclosure of norland common now carrying onis a most serious drain</s>  and then i have made a little purchase withinthis half year east kingham farm you must remember the place whereold gibson used to live</s>  the land was so very desirable for me inevery respect so immediately adjoining my own property that i felt itmy duty to buy it</s>  i could not have answered it to my conscience tolet it fall into any other hands</s>  a man must pay for his convenienceand it has cost me a vast deal of money</s> more than you think it really and intrinsically worth</s> why i hope not that</s>  i might have sold it again the next day formore than i gave but with regard to the purchasemoney i might havebeen very unfortunate indeed for the stocks were at that time so lowthat if i had not happened to have the necessary sum in my bankershands i must have sold out to very great loss</s> elinor could only smile</s> other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming tonorland</s>  our respected father as you well know bequeathed all thestanhill effects that remained at norland and very valuable they wereto your mother</s>  far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had anundoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but inconsequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases oflinen china c</s>  to supply the place of what was taken away</s>  you mayguess after all these expenses how very far we must be from beingrich and how acceptable mrs</s>  ferrarss kindness is</s> certainly said elinor and assisted by her liberality i hope youmay yet live to be in easy circumstances</s> another year or two may do much towards it he gravely replied buthowever there is still a great deal to be done</s>  there is not a stonelaid of fannys greenhouse and nothing but the plan of theflowergarden marked out</s> where is the greenhouse to be</s> upon the knoll behind the house</s>  the old walnut trees are all comedown to make room for it</s>  it will be a very fine object from manyparts of the park and the flowergarden will slope down just beforeit and be exceedingly pretty</s>  we have cleared away all the old thornsthat grew in patches over the brow</s> elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was verythankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation</s> having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away thenecessity of buying a pair of earrings for each of his sisters in hisnext visit at grays his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he beganto congratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs</s>  jennings</s> she seems a most valuable woman indeedher house her style ofliving all bespeak an exceeding good income and it is an acquaintancethat has not only been of great use to you hitherto but in the end mayprove materially advantageous</s> her inviting you to town is certainly avast thing in your favour and indeed it speaks altogether so great aregard for you that in all probability when she dies you will not beforgotten</s>  she must have a great deal to leave</s> nothing at all i should rather suppose for she has only herjointure which will descend to her children</s> but it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income</s>  fewpeople of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves shewill be able to dispose of</s> and do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to herdaughters than to us</s> her daughters are both exceedingly well married and therefore icannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther</s> whereas in my opinion by her taking so much notice of you andtreating you in this kind of way she has given you a sort of claim onher future consideration which a conscientious woman would notdisregard</s>  nothing can be kinder than her behaviour and she canhardly do all this without being aware of the expectation it raises</s> but she raises none in those most concerned</s>  indeed brother youranxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far</s> why to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself people havelittle have very little in their power</s>  but my dear elinor what isthe matter with marianne</s>  she looks very unwell has lost her colourand is grown quite thin</s>  is she ill</s> she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for severalweeks</s> i am sorry for that</s>  at her time of life any thing of an illnessdestroys the bloom for ever</s>  hers has been a very short one</s>  she wasas handsome a girl last september as i ever saw and as likely toattract the man</s>  there was something in her style of beauty to pleasethem particularly</s>  i remember fanny used to say that she would marrysooner and better than you did not but what she is exceedingly fond ofyou but so it happened to strike her</s>  she will be mistaken however</s> i question whether marianne now will marry a man worth more than fiveor six hundred ayear at the utmost and i am very much deceived ifyou do not do better</s>  dorsetshire</s>  i know very little of dorsetshirebut my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of itand i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among theearliest and best pleased of your visitors</s> elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was nolikelihood of her marrying colonel brandon but it was an expectationof too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was reallyresolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting themarriage by every possible attention</s>  he had just compunction enoughfor having done nothing for his sisters himself to be exceedinglyanxious that everybody else should do a great deal and an offer fromcolonel brandon or a legacy from mrs</s>  jennings was the easiest meansof atoning for his own neglect</s> they were lucky enough to find lady middleton at home and sir johncame in before their visit ended</s>  abundance of civilities passed onall sides</s>  sir john was ready to like anybody and though mr</s>  dashwooddid not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a verygoodnatured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in hisappearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr</s>  dashwoodwent away delighted with both</s> i shall have a charming account to carry to fanny said he as hewalked back with his sister</s>  lady middleton is really a most elegantwoman</s>  such a woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know</s>  and mrs</s> jennings too an exceedingly wellbehaved woman though not so elegantas her daughter</s>  your sister need not have any scruple even ofvisiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case andvery naturally for we only knew that mrs</s>  jennings was the widow of aman who had got all his money in a low way and fanny and mrs</s>  ferrarswere both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughterswere such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with</s>  but nowi can carry her a most satisfactory account of both</s> chapter 34mrs</s>  john dashwood had so much confidence in her husbands judgmentthat she waited the very next day both on mrs</s>  jennings and herdaughter and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the formereven the woman with whom her sisters were staying by no means unworthyher notice and as for lady middleton she found her one of the mostcharming women in the world</s> lady middleton was equally pleased with mrs</s>  dashwood</s>  there was akind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutuallyattracted them and they sympathised with each other in an insipidpropriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding</s> the same manners however which recommended mrs</s>  john dashwood to thegood opinion of lady middleton did not suit the fancy of mrs</s>  jenningsand to her she appeared nothing more than a little proudlooking womanof uncordial address who met her husbands sisters without anyaffection and almost without having anything to say to them for ofthe quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street she sat at leastseven minutes and a half in silence</s> elinor wanted very much to know though she did not chuse to askwhether edward was then in town but nothing would have induced fannyvoluntarily to mention his name before her till able to tell her thathis marriage with miss morton was resolved on or till her husbandsexpectations on colonel brandon were answered because she believedthem still so very much attached to each other that they could not betoo sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion</s>  theintelligence however which she would not give soon flowed fromanother quarter</s>  lucy came very shortly to claim elinors compassionon being unable to see edward though he had arrived in town with mr</s> and mrs</s>  dashwood</s>  he dared not come to bartletts buildings for fearof detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to betold they could do nothing at present but write</s> edward assured them himself of his being in town within a very shorttime by twice calling in berkeley street</s>  twice was his card found onthe table when they returned from their mornings engagements</s>  elinorwas pleased that he had called and still more pleased that she hadmissed him</s> the dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the middletons thatthough not much in the habit of giving anything they determined togive thema dinner and soon after their acquaintance began invitedthem to dine in harley street where they had taken a very good housefor three months</s>  their sisters and mrs</s>  jennings were invitedlikewise and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon whoalways glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eagercivilities with some surprise but much more pleasure</s>  they were tomeet mrs</s>  ferrars but elinor could not learn whether her sons were tobe of the party</s>  the expectation of seeing her however was enough tomake her interested in the engagement for though she could now meetedwards mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised toattend such an introduction though she could now see her with perfectindifference as to her opinion of herself her desire of being incompany with mrs</s>  ferrars her curiosity to know what she was like wasas lively as ever</s> the interest with which she thus anticipated the party was soonafterwards increased more powerfully than pleasantly by her hearingthat the miss steeles were also to be at it</s> so well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton so agreeablehad their assiduities made them to her that though lucy was certainlynot so elegant and her sister not even genteel she was as ready assir john to ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street and ithappened to be particularly convenient to the miss steeles as soon asthe dashwoods invitation was known that their visit should begin afew days before the party took place</s> their claims to the notice of mrs</s>  john dashwood as the nieces of thegentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might nothave done much however towards procuring them seats at her table butas lady middletons guests they must be welcome and lucy who had longwanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view oftheir characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunityof endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her lifethan she was on receiving mrs</s>  john dashwoods card</s> on elinor its effect was very different</s>  she began immediately todetermine that edward who lived with his mother must be asked as hismother was to a party given by his sister and to see him for thefirst time after all that passed in the company of lucy</s> she hardlyknew how she could bear it</s> these apprehensions perhaps were not founded entirely on reason andcertainly not at all on truth</s>  they were relieved however not by herown recollection but by the good will of lucy who believed herself tobe inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that edwardcertainly would not be in harley street on tuesday and even hoped tobe carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was keptaway by the extreme affection for herself which he could not concealwhen they were together</s> the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladiesto this formidable motherinlaw</s> pity me dear miss dashwood</s>  said lucy as they walked up the stairstogetherfor the middletons arrived so directly after mrs</s>  jenningsthat they all followed the servant at the same timethere is nobodyhere but you that can feel for me</s> i declare i can hardly stand</s> good gracious</s> in a moment i shall see the person that all myhappiness depends onthat is to be my mother</s> elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting thepossibility of its being miss mortons mother rather than her ownwhom they were about to behold but instead of doing that she assuredher and with great sincerity that she did pity herto the utteramazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped atleast to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor</s> mrs</s>  ferrars was a little thin woman upright even to formality inher figure and serious even to sourness in her aspect</s>  hercomplexion was sallow and her features small without beauty andnaturally without expression but a lucky contraction of the brow hadrescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity by giving itthe strong characters of pride and ill nature</s>  she was not a woman ofmany words for unlike people in general she proportioned them to thenumber of her ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her notone fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed with the spiriteddetermination of disliking her at all events</s> elinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour</s>  a few monthsago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it was not in mrs</s>  ferrarspower to distress her by it nowand the difference of her manners tothe miss steeles a difference which seemed purposely made to humbleher more only amused her</s>  she could not but smile to see thegraciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person forlucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others had they knownas much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify whileshe herself who had comparatively no power to wound them satpointedly slighted by both</s>  but while she smiled at a graciousness somisapplied she could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from whichit sprung nor observe the studied attentions with which the misssteeles courted its continuance without thoroughly despising them allfour</s> lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished and misssteele wanted only to be teazed about dr</s>  davies to be perfectly happy</s> the dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous and every thingbespoke the mistresss inclination for show and the masters abilityto support it</s>  in spite of the improvements and additions which weremaking to the norland estate and in spite of its owner having oncebeen within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at aloss nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried toinfer from itno poverty of any kind except of conversationappearedbut there the deficiency was considerable</s>  john dashwoodhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wifehad still less</s>  but there was no peculiar disgrace in this for it wasvery much the case with the chief of their visitors who almost alllaboured under one or other of these disqualifications for beingagreeablewant of sense either natural or improvedwant ofelegancewant of spiritsor want of temper</s> when the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom after dinner this povertywas particularly evident for the gentlemen had supplied the discoursewith some varietythe variety of politics inclosing land andbreaking horsesbut then it was all over and one subject only engagedthe ladies till coffee came in which was the comparative heights ofharry dashwood and lady middletons second son william who werenearly of the same age</s> had both the children been there the affair might have been determinedtoo easily by measuring them at once but as harry only was present itwas all

mothers though each really convinced that her own son was thetallest politely decided in favour of the other</s> the two grandmothers with not less partiality but more sinceritywere equally earnest in support of their own descendant</s> lucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the otherthought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age and could notconceive that there could be the smallest difference in the worldbetween them and miss steele with yet greater address gave it asfast as she could in favour of each</s> elinor having once delivered her opinion on williams side by whichshe offended mrs</s>  ferrars and fanny still more did not see thenecessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion and marianne whencalled on for hers offended them all by declaring that she had noopinion to give as she had never thought about it</s> before her removing from norland elinor had painted a very pretty pairof screens for her sisterinlaw which being now just mounted andbrought home ornamented her present drawing room and these screenscatching the eye of john dashwood on his following the other gentlemeninto the room were officiously handed by him to colonel brandon forhis admiration</s> these are done by my eldest sister said he and you as a man oftaste will i dare say be pleased with them</s>  i do not know whetheryou have ever happened to see any of her performances

youant well</s> i never was in better health</s> i am glad of it with all my heart but really you did not look it</s>  ishould be sorry to have you ill you that have been the greatestcomfort to me in the world</s> heaven knows what i should have donewithout your friendship</s> elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success</s> but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she directly repliedindeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard for me and next toedwards love it is the greatest comfort i have</s> poor edward</s> butnow there is one good thing we shall be able to meet and meet prettyoften for lady middletons delighted with mrs</s>  dashwood so we shallbe a good deal in harley street i dare say and edward spends half histime with his sisterbesides lady middleton and mrs</s>  ferrars willvisit nowand mrs</s>  ferrars and your sister were both so good to saymore than once they should always be glad to see me</s>  they are suchcharming women</s> i am sure if ever you tell your sister what i think ofher you cannot speak too high</s> but elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she shouldtell her sister</s>  lucy continued</s> i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if mrs</s>  ferrars had tooka dislike to me</s>  if she had only made me a formal courtesy forinstance without saying a word and never after had took any notice ofme and never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know what i meanifi had been treated in that forbidding sort of way i should have gaveit all up in despair</s>  i could not have stood it</s>  for where she doesdislike i know it is most violent</s> elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph bythe doors being thrown open the servants announcing mr</s>  ferrars andedwards immediately walking in</s> it was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed thatit was so</s>  they all looked exceedingly foolish and edward seemed tohave as great an inclination to walk out of the room again as toadvance farther into it</s>  the very circumstance in its unpleasantestform which they would each have been most anxious to avoid had fallenon them</s> they were not only all three together but were togetherwithout the relief of any other person</s>  the ladies recoveredthemselves first</s>  it was not lucys business to put herself forwardand the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up</s>  she couldtherefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing himsaid no more</s> but elinor had more to do and so anxious was she for his sake and herown to do it well that she forced herself after a momentsrecollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almosteasy and almost open and another struggle another effort stillimproved them</s>  she would not allow the presence of lucy nor theconsciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her fromsaying that she was happy to see him and that she had very muchregretted being from home when he called before in berkeley street</s> she would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which asa friend and almost a relation were his due by the observant eyes oflucy though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her</s> her manners gave some reassurance to edward and he had courage enoughto sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies ina proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex mightmake it rare for his heart had not the indifference of lucys norcould his conscience have quite the ease of elinors</s> lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make nocontribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a wordand almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who wasobliged to volunteer all the information about her mothers healththeir coming to town c</s>  which edward ought to have inquired aboutbut never did</s> her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herselfso heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetchingmarianne to leave the others by themselves and she really did it andthat in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes onthe landingplace with the most highminded fortitude before she wentto her sister</s>  when that was once done however it was time for theraptures of edward to cease for mariannes joy hurried her into thedrawingroom immediately</s>  her pleasure in seeing him was like everyother of her feelings strong in itself and strongly spoken</s>  she methim with a hand that would be taken and a voice that expressed theaffection of a sister</s> dear edward</s>  she cried this is a moment of great happiness</s> thiswould almost make amends for every thing</s> edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved but before suchwitnesses he dared not say half what he really felt</s>  again they allsat down and for a moment or two all were silent while marianne waslooking with the most speaking tenderness sometimes at edward andsometimes at elinor regretting only that their delight in each othershould be checked by lucys unwelcome presence</s>  edward was the firstto speak and it was to notice mariannes altered looks and expresshis fear of her not finding london agree with her</s> oh dont think of me</s>  she replied with spirited earnestness thoughher eyes were filled with tears as she spoke dont think of myhealth</s>  elinor is well you see</s>  that must be enough for us both</s> this remark was not calculated to make edward or elinor more easy norto conciliate the good will of lucy who looked up at marianne with novery benignant expression</s> do you like london</s>  said edward willing to say any thing that mightintroduce another subject</s> not at all</s>  i expected much pleasure in it but i have found none</s> the sight of you edward is the only comfort it has afforded andthank heaven</s>  you are what you always were</s> she pausedno one spoke</s> i think elinor she presently added we must employ edward to takecare of us in our return to barton</s>  in a week or two i suppose weshall be going and i trust edward will not be very unwilling toaccept the charge</s> poor edward muttered something but what it was nobody knew not evenhimself</s>  but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily traceit to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied andsoon talked of something else</s> we spent such a day edward in harley street yesterday</s>  so dull sowretchedly dull</s> but i have much to say to you on that head whichcannot be said now</s> and with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of herfinding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever and of herbeing particularly disgusted with his mother till they were more inprivate</s> but why were you not there edward</s> why did you not come</s> i was engaged elsewhere</s> engaged</s>  but what was that when such friends were to be met</s> perhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take some revenge onher you think young men never stand upon engagements if they have nomind to keep them little as well as great</s> elinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely insensible of thesting for she calmly repliednot so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure thatconscience only kept edward from harley street</s>  and i really believehe has the most delicate conscience in the world the most scrupulousin performing every engagement however minute and however it may makeagainst his interest or pleasure</s>  he is the most fearful of givingpain of wounding expectation and the most incapable of being selfishof any body i ever saw</s>  edward it is so and i will say it</s>  what</s> are you never to hear yourself praised</s> then you must be no friend ofmine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit tomy open commendation</s> the nature of her commendation in the present case however happenedto be particularly illsuited to the feelings of two thirds of herauditors and was so very unexhilarating to edward that he very soongot up to go away</s> going so soon</s>  said marianne my dear edward this must not be</s> and drawing him a little aside she whispered her persuasion that lucycould not stay much longer</s>  but even this encouragement failed for hewould go and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lastedtwo hours soon afterwards went away</s> what can bring her here so often</s>  said marianne on her leaving them</s> could not she see that we wanted her gone</s> how teazing to edward</s> why so</s> we were all his friends and lucy has been the longest knownto him of any</s>  it is but natural that he should like to see her aswell as ourselves</s> marianne looked at her steadily and said you know elinor that thisis a kind of talking which i cannot bear</s>  if you only hope to haveyour assertion contradicted as i must suppose to be the case youought to recollect that i am the last person in the world to do it</s>  icannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are not reallywanted</s> she then left the room and elinor dared not follow her to say morefor bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to lucy she could giveno information that would convince marianne and painful as theconsequences of her still continuing in an error might be she wasobliged to submit to it</s>  all that she could hope was that edwardwould not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearingmariannes mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part ofthe pain that had attended their recent meetingand this she had everyreason to expect</s> chapter 36within a few days after this meeting the newspapers announced to theworld that the lady of thomas palmer esq</s>  was safely delivered of ason and heir a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph at leastto all those intimate connections who knew it before</s> this event highly important to mrs</s>  jenningss happiness produced atemporary alteration in the disposal of her time and influenced in alike degree the engagements of her young friends for as she wished tobe as much as possible with charlotte she went thither every morning assoon as she was dressed and did not return till late in the eveningand the miss dashwoods at the particular request of the middletonsspent the whole of every day in conduit street</s>  for their own comfortthey would much rather have remained at least all the morning in mrs</s> jenningss house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishesof everybody</s>  their hours were therefore made over to lady middleton andthe two miss steeles by whom their company in fact was as littlevalued as it was professedly sought</s> they had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former andby the latter they were considered with a jealous eye as intruding ontheir ground and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize</s> though nothing could be more polite than lady middletons behaviour toelinor and marianne she did not really like them at all</s>  because theyneither flattered herself nor her children she could not believe themgoodnatured and because they were fond of reading she fancied themsatirical perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satiricalbut that did not signify</s>  it was censure in common use and easilygiven</s> their presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy</s>  it checked theidleness of one and the business of the other</s>  lady middleton wasashamed of doing nothing before them and the flattery which lucy wasproud to think of and administer at other times she feared they woulddespise her for offering</s>  miss steele was the least discomposed of thethree by their presence and it was in their power to reconcile her toit entirely</s>  would either of them only have given her a full andminute account of the whole affair between marianne and mr</s>  willoughbyshe would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of thebest place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned</s> but this conciliation was not granted for though she often threw outexpressions of pity for her sister to elinor and more than once dropta reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect wasproduced but a look of indifference from the former or of disgust inthe latter</s>  an effort even yet lighter might have made her theirfriend</s>  would they only have laughed at her about the doctor</s>  but solittle were they anymore than the others inclined to oblige her thatif sir john dined from home she might spend a whole day withouthearing any other raillery on the subject than what she was kindenough to bestow on herself</s> all these jealousies and discontents however were so totallyunsuspected by mrs</s>  jennings that she thought it a delightful thingfor the girls to be together and generally congratulated her youngfriends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid oldwoman so long</s>  she joined them sometimes at sir johns sometimes ather own house but wherever it was she always came in excellentspirits full of delight and importance attributing charlottes welldoing to her own care and ready to give so exact so minute a detailof her situation as only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire</s> one thing did disturb her and of that she made her daily complaint</s> mr</s>  palmer maintained the common but unfatherly opinion among his sexof all infants being alike and though she could plainly perceive atdifferent times the most striking resemblance between this baby andevery one of his relations on both sides there was no convincing hisfather of it no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly likeevery other baby of the same age nor could he even be brought toacknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in theworld</s> i come now to the relation of a misfortune which about this timebefell mrs</s>  john dashwood</s>  it so happened that while her two sisterswith mrs</s>  jennings were first calling on her in harley street anotherof her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance in itself notapparently likely to produce evil to her</s>  but while the imaginationsof other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of ourconduct and to decide on it by slight appearances ones happinessmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance</s>  in the presentinstance this lastarrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outruntruth and probability that on merely hearing the name of the missdashwoods and understanding them to be mr</s>  dashwoods sisters sheimmediately concluded them to be staying in harley street and thismisconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards cards ofinvitation for them as well as for their brother and sister to a smallmusical party at her house</s>  the consequence of which was that mrs</s> john dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly greatinconvenience of sending her carriage for the miss dashwoods but whatwas still worse must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearingto treat them with attention and who could tell that they might notexpect to go out with her a second time</s>  the power of disappointingthem it was true must always be hers</s>  but that was not enough forwhen people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to bewrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better fromthem</s> marianne had now been brought by degrees so much into the habit ofgoing out every day that it was become a matter of indifference toher whether she went or not and she prepared quietly and mechanicallyfor every evenings engagement though without expecting the smallestamusement from any and very often without knowing till the lastmoment where it was to take her</s> to her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent asnot to bestow half the consideration on it during the whole of hertoilet which it received from miss steele in the first five minutes oftheir being together when it was finished</s>  nothing escaped her minuteobservation and general curiosity she saw every thing and asked everything was never easy till she knew the price of every part ofmariannes dress could have guessed the number of her gowns altogetherwith better judgment than marianne herself and was not without hopesof finding out before they parted how much her washing cost per weekand how much she had every year to spend upon herself</s>  theimpertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover was generallyconcluded with a compliment which though meant as its douceur wasconsidered by marianne as the greatest impertinence of all for afterundergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown thecolour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair she was almostsure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart and shedared to say she would make a great many conquests</s> with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the presentoccasion to her brothers carriage which they were ready to enterfive minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not veryagreeable to their sisterinlaw who had preceded them to the house ofher acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their partthat might inconvenience either herself or her coachman</s> the events of this evening were not very remarkable</s>  the party likeother musical parties comprehended a great many people who had realtaste for the performance and a great many more who had none at alland the performers themselves were as usual in their own estimationand that of their immediate friends the first private performers inengland</s> as elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so she made noscruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte whenever itsuited her and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp andvioloncello would fix them at pleasure on any other object in theroom</s>  in one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group ofyoung men the very he who had given them a lecture on toothpickcasesat grays</s>  she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself andspeaking familiarly to her brother and had just determined to find outhis name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr</s> dashwood introduced him to her as mr</s>  robert ferrars</s> he addressed her with easy civility and twisted his head into a bowwhich assured her as plainly as words could have done that he wasexactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by lucy</s>  happyhad it been for her if her regard for edward had depended less on hisown merit than on the merit of his nearest relations</s>  for then hisbrothers bow must have given the finishing stroke to what theillhumour of his mother and sister would have begun</s>  but while shewondered at the difference of the two young men she did not find thatthe emptiness of conceit of the one put her out of all charity withthe modesty and worth of the other</s>  why they were different robertexclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hoursconversation for talking of his brother and lamenting the extremegaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in propersociety he candidly and generously attributed it much less to anynatural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private educationwhile he himself though probably without any particular any materialsuperiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public schoolwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man</s> upon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more and so i oftentell my mother when she is grieving about it</s>  my dear madam ialways say to her you must make yourself easy</s>  the evil is nowirremediable and it has been entirely your own doing</s>  why would yoube persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your own judgment toplace edward under private tuition at the most critical time of hislife</s>  if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myselfinstead of sending him to mr</s>  pratts all this would have beenprevented</s>  this is the way in which i always consider the matter andmy mother is perfectly convinced of her error</s> elinor would not oppose his opinion because whatever might be hergeneral estimation of the advantage of a public school she could notthink of edwards abode in mr</s>  pratts family with any satisfaction</s> you reside in devonshire i thinkwas his next observation in acottage near dawlish</s> elinor set him right as to its situation and it seemed rathersurprising to him that anybody could live in devonshire without livingnear dawlish</s>  he bestowed his hearty approbation however on theirspecies of house</s> for my own part said he i am excessively fond of a cottage thereis always so much comfort so much elegance about them</s>  and i protestif i had any money to spare i should buy a little land and build onemyself within a short distance of london where i might drive myselfdown at any time and collect a few friends about me and be happy</s>  iadvise every body who is going to build to build a cottage</s>  my friendlord courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my adviceand laid before me three different plans of bonomis</s>  i was to decideon the best of them</s>  my dear courtland said i immediately throwingthem all into the fire do not adopt either of them but by all meansbuild a cottage</s>  and that i fancy will be the end of it</s> some people imagine that there can be no accommodations no space in acottage but this is all a mistake</s>  i was last month at my friendelliotts near dartford</s>  lady elliott wished to give a dance</s>  buthow can it be done</s>  said she my dear ferrars do tell me how it isto be managed</s>  there is not a room in this cottage that will hold tencouple and where can the supper be</s>  i immediately saw that therecould be no difficulty in it so i said my dear lady elliott do notbe uneasy</s>  the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with easecardtables may be placed in the drawingroom the library may be openfor tea and other refreshments and let the supper be set out in thesaloon</s>  lady elliott was delighted with the thought</s>  we measured thediningroom and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple and theaffair was arranged precisely after my plan</s>  so that in fact yousee if people do but know how to set about it every comfort may be aswell enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling</s> elinor agreed to it all for she did not think he deserved thecompliment of rational opposition</s> as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sisterhis mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else and a thoughtstruck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife forher approbation when they got home</s>  the consideration of mrs</s> dennisons mistake in supposing his sisters their guests hadsuggested the propriety of their being really invited to become suchwhile mrs</s>  jenningss engagements kept her from home</s>  the expense wouldbe nothing the inconvenience not more and it was altogether anattention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to berequisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to hisfather</s>  fanny was startled at the proposal</s> i do not see how it can be done said she without affronting ladymiddleton for they spend every day with her otherwise i should beexceedingly glad to do it</s>  you know i am always ready to pay them anyattention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews</s>  butthey are lady middletons visitors</s>  how can i ask them away from her</s> her husband but with great humility did not see the force of herobjection</s>  they had already spent a week in this manner in conduitstreet and lady middleton could not be displeased at their giving thesame number of days to such near relations</s> fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor saidmy love i would ask them with all my heart if it was in my power</s> but i had just settled within myself to ask the miss steeles to spend afew days with us</s>  they are very well behaved good kind of girls andi think the attention is due to them as their uncle did so very wellby edward</s>  we can ask your sisters some other year you know but themiss steeles may not be in town any more</s>  i am sure you will likethem indeed you do like them you know very much already and sodoes my mother and they are such favourites with harry</s> mr</s>  dashwood was convinced</s>  he saw the necessity of inviting the misssteeles immediately and his conscience was pacified by the resolutionof inviting his sisters another year at the same time however slylysuspecting that another year would make the invitation needless bybringing elinor to town as colonel brandons wife and marianne astheir visitor</s> fanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready wit that hadprocured it wrote the next morning to lucy to request her company andher sisters for some days in harley street as soon as ladymiddleton could spare them</s>  this was enough to make lucy really andreasonably happy</s>  mrs</s>  dashwood seemed actually working for herherself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views</s>  suchan opportunity of being with edward and his family was above allthings the most material to her interest

not before had any precise limitswas instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two daystime</s> when the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten minutes afterits arrival it gave her for the first time some share in theexpectations of lucy for such a mark of uncommon kindness vouchsafedon so short an acquaintance seemed to declare that the goodwilltowards her arose from something more than merely malice againstherself and might be brought by time and address to do every thingthat lucy wished</s>  her flattery had already subdued the pride of ladymiddleton and made an entry into the close heart of mrs</s>  johndashwood and these were effects that laid open the probability ofgreater</s> the miss steeles removed to harley street and all that reached elinorof their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event</s> sir john who called on them more than once brought home such accountsof the favour they were in as must be universally striking</s>  mrs</s> dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in herlife as she was with them had given each of them a needle book madeby some emigrant called lucy by her christian name and did not knowwhether she should ever be able to part with them</s>
at this point in the first and second editions volume ii ended</s> chapter 37mrs</s>
 palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother feltit no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her andcontenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned fromthat period to her own home and her own habits in which she found themiss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share</s> about the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled inberkeley street mrs</s>  jennings on returning from her ordinary visit tomrs</s>  palmer entered the drawingroom where elinor was sitting byherself with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her tohear something wonderful and giving her time only to form that ideabegan directly to justify it by sayinglord</s>  my dear miss dashwood</s>  have you heard the news</s> no maam</s>  what is it</s> something so strange</s>  but you shall hear it all</s>  when i got to mr</s> palmers i found charlotte quite in a fuss about the child</s>  she wassure it was very illit cried and fretted and was all over pimples</s> so i looked at it directly and lord</s>  my dear says i it isnothing in the world but the red gum and nurse said just the same</s> but charlotte she would not be satisfied so mr</s>  donavan was sent forand luckily he happened to just come in from harley street so hestepped over directly and as soon as ever mama he saidjust as we did that it was nothing in the world but the red gum andthen charlotte was easy</s>  and so just as he was going away again itcame into my head i am sure i do not know how i happened to think ofit but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news</s>  so uponthat he smirked and simpered and looked grave and seemed to knowsomething or other and at last he said in a whisper for fear anyunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as totheir sisters indisposition i think it advisable to say that ibelieve there is no great reason for alarm i hope mrs</s>  dashwood willdo very well</s> what</s>  is fanny ill</s> that is exactly what i said my dear</s>  lord</s>  says i is mrs</s> dashwood ill</s>  so then it all came out and the long and the short ofthe matter by all i can learn seems to be this</s>  mr</s>  edward ferrarsthe very young man i used to joke with you about but however as itturns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it mr</s> edward ferrars it seems has been engaged above this twelvemonth to mycousin lucy</s> theres for you my dear</s> and not a creature knowing asyllable of the matter except nancy</s> could you have believed such athing possible</s>  there is no great wonder in their liking one anotherbut that matters should be brought so forward between them and nobodysuspect it</s> that is strange</s> i never happened to see them togetheror i am sure i should have found it out directly</s>  well and so thiswas kept a great secret for fear of mrs</s>  ferrars and neither she noryour brother or sister suspected a word of the mattertill this verymorning poor nancy who you know is a wellmeaning creature but noconjurer popt it all out</s>  lord</s>  thinks she to herself they areall so fond of lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty

thought tomake a match between edward and some lords daughter or other i forgetwho</s>  so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride</s> she fell into violent hysterics immediately with such screams asreached your brothers ears as he was sitting in his own dressingroomdown stairs thinking about writing a letter to his steward in thecountry</s>  so up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place forlucy was come to them by that time little dreaming what was going on</s> poor soul</s>  i pity her</s>  and i must say i think she was used veryhardly for your sister

mrs</s>  dashwood declared they should not stay a minutelonger in the house and your brother was forced to go down upon hisknees too to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed uptheir

about money andgreatness</s>  there is no reason on earth why mr</s>  edward and lucy shouldnot marry for i am sure mrs</s>  ferrars may afford to do very well by herson and though lucy has next to

hoped might be thecase had ceased to imagine her at all attached to edward and happyabove all the rest in the absence of marianne she felt very well ableto speak of the affair without embarrassment

undeceiving her in making her acquainted with the real truthand in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by otherswithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister or anyresentment against edward</s> elinors office was a painful one</s> she was going to remove what shereally believed to be her sisters chief consolationto give suchparticulars of edward as she feared

such a task must be it was necessary tobe done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it</s> she was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings or torepresent herself as suffering much any

in a very spirited critique upon theparty</s> chapter 38mrs</s>  jennings was very warm in her praise of edwards conduct but onlyelinor and marianne understood its true merit</s>  they only knew howlittle he had had to tempt him to be disobedient and how small was theconsolation beyond the consciousness of doing right that could remainto him in the loss of friends and fortune</s>  elinor gloried in hisintegrity and marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for hispunishment</s>  but though confidence between them was by this publicdiscovery restored to its proper state it was not a subject on whicheither of them were fond of dwelling when alone</s>  elinor avoided itupon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by thetoo warm too positive assurances of marianne that belief of edwardscontinued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away andmariannes courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topicwhich always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by thecomparison it necessarily produced between elinors conduct and her own</s> she felt all the force of that comparison but not as her sister hadhoped to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain ofcontinual selfreproach regretted most bitterly that she had neverexerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitencewithout the hope of amendment</s>  her mind was so much weakened that shestill fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it onlydispirited her more</s> nothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards of affairsin harley street or bartletts buildings</s>  but though so much of thematter was known to them already that mrs</s>  jennings might have hadenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther without seeking aftermore she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort andinquiry to her cousins as soon as she could and nothing but thehindrance of more visitors than usual had prevented her going to themwithin that time</s> the third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars was sofine so beautiful a sunday as to draw many to kensington gardensthough it was only the second week in march</s>  mrs</s>  jennings and elinorwere of the number but marianne who knew that the willoughbys wereagain in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose ratherto stay at home than venture into so public a place</s> an intimate acquaintance of mrs</s>  jennings joined them soon after theyentered the gardens and elinor was not sorry that by her continuingwith them and engaging all mrs</s>  jenningss conversation she washerself left to quiet reflection</s>  she saw nothing of the willoughbysnothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody who could byany chance whether grave or gay be interesting to her</s>  but at lastshe found herself with some surprise accosted by miss steele whothough looking rather shy expressed great satisfaction in meetingthem and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness ofmrs</s>  jennings left her own party for a short time to join theirs</s> mrs</s>  jennings immediately whispered to elinorget it all out

angry</s> i cannot suppose it possible that she should</s> i am monstrous glad of it</s>  good gracious</s>  i have had such a time ofit</s>  i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life</s>  she vowed at firstshe would never trim me up a new bonnet nor do any thing else for meagain so long as she lived but now she is quite come to and we areas good friends as ever</s>  look she made me this bow to

sure for my part i should neverhave known he did like it better than any other colour if he had nothappened to say so</s>  my cousins have been so plaguing me</s>  i declaresometimes i do not know which way to look before them</s> she had wandered away to a subject on which elinor had nothing to sayand therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again tothe first</s> well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say whatthey chuse about mr</s>  ferrarss declaring he would not have lucy for itis no such thing i can tell you and it is quite a shame for suchillnatured reports to be spread abroad</s>  whatever lucy might thinkabout it herself you know it was no business of other people to setit down for certain</s> i never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before i assure yousaid elinor</s> oh did not you</s>  but it was said i know very well and by more thanone for miss godby told miss sparks that nobody in their senses couldexpect mr</s>  ferrars to give up a woman like miss morton with thirtythousand pounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had nothing atall and i had it from miss sparks myself</s>  and besides that my cousinrichard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr</s> ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for threedays i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heartlucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brotherswednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday andsaturday and did not know what was become of him</s>  once lucy thoughtto write to him but then her spirits rose against that</s>  however thismorning he came just as we came home from church and then it all cameout how he had been sent for wednesday to harley street and beentalked to by his mother and all of them and how he had declared beforethem all that he loved nobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would hehave</s>  and how he had been so worried by what passed that as soon ashe had went away from his mothers house he had got upon his horseand rid into the country some where or other and how he had stayedabout at an inn all thursday and friday on purpose to get the betterof it</s>  and after thinking it all over and over again he said itseemed to him as if now he had no fortune and no nothing at all itwould be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement because it mustbe for her loss for he had nothing but two thousand pounds and nohope of any thing else and if he was to go into orders as he had somethoughts he could get nothing but a curacy and how was they to liveupon that</s> he could not bear to think of her doing no better and sohe begged if she had the least mind for it to put an end to thematter directly and leave him shift for himself</s>  i heard him say allthis as plain as could possibly be</s>  and it was entirely for her sakeand upon her account that he said a word about being off and not uponhis own</s>  i will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tiredof her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any thing like it</s>  butto be sure lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking so shetold him directly with a great deal about sweet and love you knowand all thatoh la</s>  one cant repeat such kind of things youknowshe told him directly she had not the least mind in the worldto be off for she could live with him upon a trifle and how little soever he might have she should be very glad to have it all you knowor something of the kind</s>  so then he was monstrous happy and talkedon some time about what they should do and they agreed he should takeorders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living</s> and just then i could not hear any more for my cousin called frombelow to tell me mrs</s>  richardson was come in her coach and would takeone of us to kensington gardens so i was forced to go into the roomand interrupt them to ask lucy if she would like to go but she didnot care to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put on a pair ofsilk stockings and came off with the richardsons</s> i do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said elinoryou were

pleasure in presentinghim to it will be very great</s>  pray assure him of it</s> elinors astonishment at this commission could hardly have beengreater had the colonel been really making her an offer of his hand</s> the preferment which only two days before she had considered ashopeless for edward was already provided to enable him to marryandshe of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow

benevolenceand her gratitude for the particular friendship which togetherprompted colonel brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmlyexpressed</s>  she thanked him for it with all her heart spoke ofedwards principles and disposition with that praise which she knewthem to deserve and promised to undertake the commission withpleasure if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an officeto another</s>  but at the same time she could not help thinking that noone could so well perform it as himself</s>  it was an office in shortfrom which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving anobligation from her she would have been very glad to be sparedherself but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy decliningit likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through hermeans that she would not on any account make farther opposition</s> edward she believed was still in town and fortunately she had heardhis address from miss steele</s>  she could undertake therefore to informhim of it in the course of the day</s>  after this had been settledcolonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing sorespectable and agreeable a neighbour and then it was that hementioned with regret that the house was small and indifferentanevil which elinor as mrs</s>  jennings had supposed her to do made verylight of at least as far as regarded its size</s> the smallness of the house said she i cannot imagine anyinconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family andincome</s> by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering mr</s> ferrarss marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation forhe did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply suchan income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settleonand he said so</s> this little rectory can do no more than make mr</s>  ferrars comfortableas a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry</s>  i am sorry to say thatmy patronage ends with this

object of happiness</s>  his marriage must still be a distantgoodat least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon</s> such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended thedelicate feelings of mrs</s>  jennings but after this narration of whatreally passed between colonel brandon and elinor while they stood atthe window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting mayperhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor lessproperly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage</s> chapter 40well miss dashwood said mrs</s>  jennings sagaciously smiling as soonas the gentleman had withdrawn i do not ask you what the colonel hasbeen saying to you for though upon my honour i tried to keep out ofhearing i could not help catching enough to

doit but himself</s> they were interrupted by the servants coming in to announce thecarriage being at the door and mrs</s>  jennings immediately preparing togo saidwell my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out</s> but however we may have it all over in the evening for we shall bequite alone</s>  i do not ask you to go with me for i dare say your mindis too full of the matter to

maam not even lucy if you please</s>  one days delay will not bevery material and till i have written to mr</s>  ferrars i think it oughtnot to be mentioned to any body else</s>  i shall do that directly</s>  it isof importance that no time should be lost with him for he will ofcourse have much to do relative to his ordination</s> this speech at first puzzled mrs</s>  jennings exceedingly</s>  why mr</s> ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry she couldnot immediately comprehend</s>  a few moments reflection howeverproduced a very happy idea and she exclaimedoh ho</s> i understand you</s>  mr</s>  ferrars is to be the man</s>  well somuch the better for him</s>  ay to be sure he must be ordained inreadiness and i am very glad to find things are so forward betweenyou</s>  but my dear is not this rather out of character</s>  should notthe colonel write himself</s> sure he is the proper person</s> elinor did not quite understand the beginning of mrs</s>  jenningssspeech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and thereforeonly replied to its conclusion</s> colonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather wished any one toannounce his intentions to mr</s>  ferrars than himself</s> and so you are forced to do it</s>  well that is an odd kind of delicacy</s> however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write</s>  youknow your own concerns best</s>  so goodby my dear</s>  i have not heard ofany thing to please me so well since charlotte was brought to bed</s> and away she went but returning again in a momenti have just been thinking of bettys sister my dear</s>  i should bevery glad to get her so good a mistress</s>  but whether she would do fora ladys maid i am sure i cant tell</s>  she is an excellent housemaidand works very well at her needle</s>  however you will think of all thatat your leisure</s> certainly maam replied elinor not hearing much of what she saidand more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject</s> how she should beginhow she should express herself in her note toedward was now all her concern</s>  the particular circumstances betweenthem made a difficulty of that which to any other person would havebeen the easiest thing in the world but she equally feared to say toomuch or too little and sat deliberating over her paper with the penin her hand till broken in on by the entrance of edward himself</s> he had met mrs</s>  jennings at the door in her way to the carriage as hecame to leave his farewell card and she after apologising for notreturning herself had obliged him to enter by saying that missdashwood was above and wanted to speak with him on very particularbusiness</s> elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of herperplexity that however difficult it might be to express herselfproperly by letter it was at least preferable to giving theinformation by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force herupon this greatest exertion of all</s>  her astonishment and confusionwere very great on his so sudden appearance</s>  she had not seen himbefore since his engagement became public and therefore not since hisknowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness ofwhat she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made herfeel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes</s>  he too was muchdistressed and they sat down together in a most promising state ofembarrassment</s> whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion onfirst coming into the room he could not recollect but determining tobe on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he couldsay any thing after taking a chair</s> mrs</s>  jennings told me said he that you wished to speak with me atleast i understood her soor i certainly should not have intruded onyou in such a manner though at the same time i should have beenextremely sorry to leave london without seeing you and your sisterespecially as it will most likely be some timeit is not probable thati should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again</s>  i go to oxfordtomorrow</s> you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herselfand determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon aspossible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not beenable to give them in person</s>  mrs</s>  jennings was quite right in what shesaid</s>  i have something of consequence to inform you of which i was onthe point of communicating by paper</s>  i am charged with a mostagreeable office breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke</s> colonel brandon who was here only ten minutes ago has desired me tosay that understanding you mean to take orders he has great pleasurein offering you the living of delaford now just vacant and only wishesit were more valuable</s>  allow me to congratulate you on having sorespectable and welljudging a friend and to join in his wish that thelivingit is about two hundred ayearwere much more considerableand such as might better enable you toas might be more than atemporary accommodation to yourselfsuch in short as might establishall your views of happiness</s> what edward felt as he could not say it himself it cannot be expectedthat any one else should say for him</s>  he looked all the astonishmentwhich such unexpected such unthoughtof information could not fail ofexciting but he said only these two wordscolonel brandon</s> yes continued elinor gathering more resolution as some of theworst was over colonel brandon means it as a testimony of his concernfor what has lately passedfor the cruel situation in which theunjustifiable conduct of your family has placed youa concern which iam sure marianne myself and all your friends must share andlikewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character andhis particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion</s> colonel brandon give me a living</s> can it be possible</s> the unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to findfriendship any where</s> no replied he with sudden consciousness not to find it in youfor i cannot be ignorant that to you to your goodness i owe itall</s> i feel iti would express it if i couldbut as you well knowi am no orator</s> you are very much mistaken</s>  i do assure you that you owe it entirelyat least almost entirely to your own merit and colonel brandonsdiscernment of it</s>  i have had no hand in it</s>  i did not even knowtill i understood his design that the living was vacant nor had itever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift</s> as a friend of mine of my family he may perhapsindeed i know hehas still greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word you owenothing to my solicitation</s> truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action butshe was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress ofedward that she acknowledged it with hesitation which probablycontributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recentlyentered it</s>  for a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor hadceased to speakat last and as if it were rather an effort he saidcolonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability</s>  i havealways heard him spoken of as such and your brother i know esteems himhighly</s>  he is undoubtedly a sensible man and in his manners perfectlythe gentleman</s> indeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him on fartheracquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will besuch very near neighbours for i understand the parsonage is almostclose to the mansionhouse it is particularly important that heshould be all this</s> edward made no answer but when she had turned away her head gave hera look so serious so earnest so uncheerful as seemed to say that hemight hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and themansionhouse much greater</s> colonel brandon i think lodges in st</s>  james street said he soonafterwards rising from his chair</s> elinor told him the number of the house</s> i must hurry away then to give him those thanks which you will notallow me to give you to assure him that he has made me a veryanexceedingly happy man</s> elinor did not offer to detain him and they parted with a veryearnest assurance on her side of her unceasing good wishes for hishappiness in every change of situation that might befall him on hiswith rather an attempt to return the same good will than the power ofexpressing it</s> when i see him again said elinor to herself as the door shut himout i shall see him the husband of lucy</s> and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider thepast recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings ofedward and of course to reflect on her own with discontent</s> when mrs</s>  jennings came home though she returned from seeing peoplewhom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have agreat deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the importantsecret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted toit again as soon as elinor appeared</s> well my dear she cried i sent you up the young man</s>  did not ido right</s> and i suppose you had no great difficultyyou did not findhim very unwilling to accept your proposal</s> no maam that was not very likely</s> well and how soon will he be ready</s> for it seems all to depend uponthat</s> really said elinor i know so little of these kind of forms that ican hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparationnecessary but i suppose two or three months will complete hisordination</s> two or three months</s>  cried mrs</s>  jennings lord</s>  my dear how calmlyyou talk of it and can the colonel wait two or three months</s>  lordbless me</s> i am sure it would put me quite out of patience</s> and thoughone would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr</s>  ferrars i do thinkit is not worth while to wait two or three months for him</s>  suresomebody else might be found that would do as well somebody that is inorders already</s> my dear maam said elinor what can you be thinking of</s>  whycolonel brandons only object is to be of use to mr</s>  ferrars</s> lord bless you my dear</s> sure you do not mean to persuade me that thecolonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to mr</s> ferrars</s> the deception could not continue after this and an explanationimmediately took place by which both gained considerable amusement forthe moment without any material loss of happiness to either for mrs</s> jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another and stillwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first</s> aye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she after the firstebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over and very likely maybe out of repair but to hear a man apologising as i thought for ahouse that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the groundfloorand i think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds</s> and toyou too that had been used to live in barton cottage</s>  it seems quiteridiculous</s>  but my dear we must touch up the colonel to do something to the parsonage and make it comfortable for them before lucygoes to it</s> but colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea of the livingsbeing enough to allow them to marry</s> the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand ayearhimself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less</s>  take my wordfor it that if i am alive i shall be paying a visit at delafordparsonage before michaelmas and i am sure i shant go if lucy antthere</s> elinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability of their notwaiting for any thing more</s> chapter 41edward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon proceeded withhis happiness to lucy and such was the excess of it by the time hereached bartletts buildings that she was able to assure mrs</s> jennings who called on her again the next day with hercongratulations that she had never seen him in such spirits before inher life</s> her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain andshe joined mrs</s>  jennings most heartily in her expectation of theirbeing all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas</s> so far was she at the same time from any backwardness to give elinorthat credit which edward would give her that she spoke of herfriendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready toown all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertionfor their good on miss dashwoods part either present or future wouldever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any thing inthe world for those she really valued</s>  as for colonel brandon she wasnot only ready to worship him as a saint but was moreover trulyanxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concernsanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost and scarcelyresolved to avail herself at delaford as far as she possibly couldof his servants his carriage his cows and his poultry</s> it was now above a week since john dashwood had called in berkeleystreet and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of hiswifes indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feelit necessary to pay her a visit</s> this was an obligation howeverwhich not only opposed her own inclination but which had not theassistance of any encouragement from her companions</s>  marianne notcontented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent toprevent her sisters going at all and mrs</s>  jennings though hercarriage was always at elinors service so very much disliked mrs</s> john dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked afterthe late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by takingedwards part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her companyagain</s>  the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay avisit for which no one could really have less inclination and to runthe risk of a teteatete with a woman whom neither of the others hadso much reason to dislike</s> mrs</s>  dashwood was denied but before the carriage could turn from thehouse her husband accidentally came out</s>  he expressed great pleasurein meeting elinor told her that he had been just going to call inberkeley street and assuring her that fanny would be very glad to seeher invited her to come in</s> they walked up stairs in to the drawingroom</s> nobody was there</s> fanny is in her own room i

and marianne were always greatfavourites</s> why would not marianne come</s> elinor made what excuse she could for her</s> i am not sorry to see you alone he replied for i have a good dealto say to you</s>  this living of colonel brandonscan it be true</s> hashe really given it to edward</s> i heard it yesterday by chance and wascoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it</s> it is perfectly true</s> colonel brandon has given the living ofdelaford to edward</s> really</s> well this is very astonishing</s> no relationship</s> noconnection between them</s> and now that livings fetch such aprice</s> what was the value of this</s> about two hundred a year</s> very welland for the next presentation to a living of thatvaluesupposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly andlikely to vacate it soonhe might have got i dare sayfourteenhundred pounds</s>  and how came he not to have settled that matter beforethis persons death</s> now indeed it would be too late to sell it but aman of colonel brandons sense</s> i wonder he should be so improvidentin a point of such common such natural concern</s> well i am convincedthat there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every humancharacter</s>  i suppose howeveron recollectionthat the case mayprobably be this</s>  edward is only to hold the living till the person towhom the colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough totake it</s> aye aye that is the fact depend upon it</s> elinor contradicted it however very positively and by relating thatshe had herself been employed in conveying the offer from colonelbrandon to edward and therefore must understand the terms on whichit was given obliged him to submit to her authority</s> it is truly astonishing</s> he cried after hearing what shesaidwhat could be the colonels motive</s> a very simple oneto be of use to mr</s>  ferrars</s> well well whatever colonel brandon may be edward is a very luckyman</s> you will not mention the matter to fanny however for though ihave broke it to her and she bears it vastly wellshe will not liketo hear it much talked of</s> elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that shethought fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealthto her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possiblyimpoverished</s> mrs</s>  ferrars added he lowering his voice to the tone becoming soimportant a subject knows nothing about it at present and i believeit will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as maybe</s>  when the marriage takes place i fear she must hear of it all</s> but why should such precaution be used</s> though it is not to besupposed that mrs</s>  ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction inknowing that her son has money enough to live uponfor that must bequite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is shesupposed to feel at all</s> she has done with her son she cast him offfor ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence casthim off likewise</s>  surely after doing so she cannot be imaginedliable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his accountshe cannotbe interested in any thing that befalls him</s>  she would not be so weakas to throw away the comfort of a child and yet retain the anxiety ofa parent</s> ah</s>  elinor said john your reasoning is very good but it isfounded on ignorance of human nature</s>  when edwards unhappy matchtakes place depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she hadnever discarded him and therefore every circumstance that mayaccelerate that dreadful event must be concealed from her as much aspossible</s>  mrs</s>  ferrars can never forget that edward is her son</s> you surprise me i should think it must nearly have escaped her memoryby this time</s> you wrong her exceedingly</s>  mrs</s>  ferrars is one of the mostaffectionate mothers in the world</s> elinor was silent</s> we think nowsaid mr</s>  dashwood after a short pause of robertsmarrying miss morton</s> elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brotherstone calmly repliedthe lady i suppose has no choice in the affair</s> choice</s>
how do you mean</s> i only mean that i suppose from your manner of speaking it must bethe same to miss morton whether she marry edward or robert</s>
certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to allintents and purposes be considered as the eldest sonand as to anything else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know thatone is superior to the other</s> elinor said no more and john was also for a short time silent</s> hisreflections ended thus</s> of one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand and speaking inan awful whisperi may assure youand i will do it because i knowit must gratify you</s>  i have good reason to thinkindeed i have itfrom the best authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise itwould be very wrong to say any thing about itbut i have it from thevery best authoritynot that i ever precisely heard mrs</s>  ferrars sayit herselfbut her daughter did and i have it from herthat inshort whatever objections there might be against a certaina certainconnectionyou understand meit would have been far preferable toher it would not have given her half the vexation that this does</s>  iwas exceedingly pleased to hear that mrs</s>  ferrars considered it in thatlighta very gratifying circumstance you know to us all</s>  it wouldhave been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two andshe would be glad to compound now for nothing worse</s>  but however allthat is quite out of the questionnot to be thought of ormentionedas to any attachment you knowit never could beall thatis gone by</s>  but i thought i would just tell you of this because iknew how much it must please you</s>  not that you have any reason toregret my dear elinor</s>  there is no doubt of your doing exceedinglywellquite as well or better perhaps all things considered</s>  hascolonel brandon been with you lately</s> elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise herselfimportance to agitate her nerves and fill her mindand she wastherefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in replyherself and from the danger of hearing any thing more from herbrother by the entrance of mr</s>  robert ferrars</s>  after a few momentschat john dashwood recollecting that fanny was yet uninformed of hersisters being there quitted the room in quest of her and elinor wasleft to improve her acquaintance with robert who by the gayunconcern the happy selfcomplacency of his manner while enjoying sounfair a division of his mothers love and liberality to the prejudiceof his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course oflife and that brothers integrity was confirming her mostunfavourable opinion of his head and heart</s> they had scarcely been two minutes by themselves before he began tospeak of edward for he too had heard of the living and was veryinquisitive on the subject</s>  elinor repeated the particulars of it asshe had given them to john and their effect on robert though verydifferent was not less striking than it had been on him</s>  he laughedmost immoderately</s>  the idea of edwards being a clergyman and livingin a small parsonagehouse diverted him beyond measureand when tothat was added the fanciful imagery of edward reading prayers in awhite surplice and publishing the banns of marriage between john smithand mary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous</s> elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity theconclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixedon him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited</s>  it was alook however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelingsand gave no intelligence to him</s>  he was recalled from wit to wisdomnot by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility</s> we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from theaffected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaietyof the momentbut upon my soul it is a most serious business</s>  pooredward</s>  he is ruined for ever</s>  i am extremely sorry for itfor iknow him to be a very goodhearted creature as wellmeaning a fellowperhaps as any in the world</s>  you must not judge of him missdashwood from your slight acquaintance</s> poor edward</s> his manners arecertainly not the happiest in nature</s> but we are not all born youknow with the same powersthe same address</s>  poor fellow</s> to seehim in a circle of strangers</s> to be sure it was pitiable enough</s> butupon my soul i believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdomand i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my life aswhen it all burst forth</s>  i could not believe it</s>  my mother was thefirst person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to actwith resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not knowwhat you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i mustsay that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see

once while she was staying in this house i happened to drop infor ten minutes and i saw quite enough of her</s>  the merest awkwardcountry girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty</s> i remember her perfectly</s>  just the kind of girl i should supposelikely to captivate poor edward</s>  i offered immediately as soon as mymother related the affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuadehim from the match but it was too late then i found to do any thingfor unluckily i was not in the way at first and knew nothing of ittill after the breach had taken place when it was not for me youknow to interfere</s>  but had i been informed of it a few hoursearlieri think it is most probablethat something might have beenhit on</s>  i certainly should have represented it to edward in a verystrong light</s>  my dear fellow i should have said consider what youare doing</s>  you are making a most disgraceful connection and such aone as your family are unanimous in disapproving</s>  i cannot helpthinking in short that means might have been found</s>  but now it isall too late</s>  he must be starved you knowthat is certainabsolutely starved</s> he had just settled this point with great composure when the entranceof mrs</s>  john dashwood put an end to the subject</s>  but though she neverspoke of it out of her own family elinor could see its influence onher mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which sheentered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself</s>  sheeven proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that elinor and hersister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more oftheman exertion in which her husband who attended her into theroom and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish everything that was most affectionate and graceful</s> chapter 42one other short call in harley street in which elinor received herbrothers congratulations on their travelling so far towards bartonwithout any expense and on colonel brandons being to follow them tocleveland in a day or two completed the intercourse of the brother andsisters in townand a faint invitation from fanny to come to norlandwhenever it should happen to be in their way which of all things wasthe most unlikely to occur with a more warm though less publicassurance from john to elinor of the promptitude with which he shouldcome to see her at delaford was all that foretold any meeting in thecountry</s> it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to sendher to delaforda place in which of all others she would now leastchuse to visit or wish to reside for not only was it considered asher future home by her brother and mrs</s>  jennings but even lucy whenthey parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there</s> very early in april and tolerably early in the day the two partiesfrom hanover square and berkeley street set out from their respectivehomes to meet by appointment on

restoring mariannes peace of mind and confirming her own</s> their journey was safely performed</s>  the second day brought them intothe cherished or the prohibited county of somerset for as such wasit dwelt on by turns in mariannes imagination and in the forenoon ofthe third they drove up to cleveland</s> cleveland was a spacious modernbuilt house situated on a slopinglawn</s>  it had no park but the pleasuregrounds were tolerablyextensive and like every other place of the same degree of importanceit had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smoothgravel winding round a

robertsmarrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her</s> she will be more hurt by it for robert always was her favourite</s> shewill be more hurt by it and on the same principle will forgive himmuch sooner</s> in what state the affair stood at present between them edward knewnot for no communication with any of his family had yet been attemptedby him</s>  he had quitted oxford

the most intimate connection</s>  he could donothing till he were assured of his fate with miss dashwood and by hisrapidity in seeking that fate it is to be supposed in spite of thejealousy with which he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite ofthe modesty with which he rated his own deserts and the politenesswith which he talked of his doubts he did not upon the whole expecta very cruel reception</s>  it was his business however to say that hedid and he said it very prettily</s>  what he might say on the subject atwelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination of husbands andwives</s> that lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish ofmalice against him in her message by thomas was perfectly clear toelinor and edward himself now thoroughly enlightened

ignorance and awant of liberality in some of her opinionsthey had been equallyimputed by him to her want of education and till her last letterreached him he had always believed her to be a welldisposedgoodhearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself</s>  nothing butsuch a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to anengagement which long before the discovery of it laid him open to hismothers anger had been a continual source of disquiet and regret tohim</s> i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings to giveher the option of continuing the engagement or not

any livingcreature how could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmlyinsisted on sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing butthe most disinterested affection was her inducement</s>  and even now icannot comprehend on what motive she acted or what fancied advantageit could be to her to be fettered to a man for whom she had not thesmallest regard and who had only two thousand pounds in the world</s> she could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a living</s> no but she might suppose that something would occur in your favourthat your own family might in time relent</s>  and at any rate she lostnothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that itfettered neither her inclination nor her actions</s>  the connection wascertainly a respectable one and probably gained her considerationamong her friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred it wouldbe better for her to marry you than be single</s> edward was of course immediately convinced that nothing could havebeen more natural than lucys conduct nor more selfevident than themotive of it</s> elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence whichcompliments themselves for having spent so much time with them atnorland when he must have felt his own inconstancy</s> your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she becauseto saynothing of my own conviction our relations were all

simple enough to think that because my faith was plighted toanother there could be no danger in my being with you and that theconsciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacredas

suppose i waswrong in remaining so much in sussex and the arguments with which ireconciled myself to the expediency of it were no better thanthesethe danger is my own i am doing no injury to anybody butmyself</s> elinor smiled and shook her head</s> edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons being expected at thecottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with himbut to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resentedhis giving him the living of delafordwhich at present said heafter thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasionhe must think i have never forgiven him for offering</s> now he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place</s> but so little interest had he taken in the matter that he owed all hisknowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the parishcondition of the land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself whohad heard so much of it from colonel brandon and heard it with so muchattention as to be entirely mistress of the subject</s> one question after this only remained undecided between them onedifficulty only was to be overcome</s>  they were brought together bymutual affection with the warmest approbation of their real friendstheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happinesscertainand they only wanted something to live upon</s>  edward had twothousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was allthat they could call their own for it was impossible that mrs</s> dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quiteenough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds ayearwould supply them with the comforts of life</s> edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in hismother towards him and on that he rested for the residue of theirincome</s>  but elinor had no such dependence for since edward wouldstill be unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself had beenspoken of in mrs</s>  ferrarss flattering language as only a lesser evilthan his chusing lucy steele she feared that roberts offence wouldserve no other purpose than to enrich fanny</s> about four days after edwards arrival colonel brandon appeared tocomplete mrs</s>  dashwoods satisfaction and to give her the dignity ofhaving for the first time since her living at barton more companywith her than her house would hold</s>  edward was allowed to retain theprivilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore walked everynight to his old quarters at the park from whence he usually returnedin the morning early enough to interrupt the lovers first teteatetebefore breakfast</s> a three weeks residence at delaford where in his evening hours atleast he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion betweenthirtysix

cheerful</s>  among such friends however and such flattery hedid revive</s>  no rumour of lucys marriage had yet reached himhe knewnothing of what had passed and the first hours of his visit wereconsequently spent in hearing and in wondering</s>  every thing wasexplained to him by mrs</s>  dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoicein what he had done for mr</s>  ferrars since eventually it promoted theinterest of elinor</s> it would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced in the goodopinion of each other as they advanced in each others acquaintancefor it could not be otherwise</s>  their resemblance in good principlesand good sense in disposition and manner of thinking would probablyhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any otherattraction but their being in love with two sisters and two sistersfond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediatewhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment</s> the letters from town which a few days before would have made everynerve in elinors body thrill with transport now arrived to be readwith less emotion than mirth</s>  mrs</s>  jennings wrote to tell

him</s> mr</s>  dashwoods strains were more solemn</s>  mrs</s>  ferrars was the mostunfortunate of womenpoor fanny had suffered agonies ofsensibilityand he considered the existence of each under such ablow with grateful wonder</s>  roberts offence was unpardonable butlucys was infinitely worse</s>  neither of them were ever again to bementioned to mrs</s>  ferrars and even if she might hereafter be inducedto forgive her son his wife should never be acknowledged as herdaughter nor be permitted to appear in her presence</s>  the secrecy withwhich everything had been carried on between them was rationallytreated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicionof it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken toprevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join with him inregretting that lucys engagement with edward had not rather beenfulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading miseryfarther in the family</s>  he thus continuedmrs</s>  ferrars has never yet mentioned edwards name which does notsurprise us but to our great astonishment not a line has beenreceived from him on the occasion</s>  perhaps however he is kept silentby his fear of offending and i shall therefore give him a hint by aline to oxford that his sister and i both think a letter of propersubmission from him addressed perhaps to fanny and by her shewn toher mother might not be taken amiss for we all know the tenderness ofmrs</s>  ferrarss heart and that she wishes for nothing so much as to beon good terms with her children</s> this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct ofedward</s>  it determined him to attempt a reconciliation though notexactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister</s> a letter of proper

she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility may beconvenient while acknowledging a second engagement almost as imprudentin her eyes as the first</s> he had nothing to urge against it but still resisted the idea of aletter of proper submission and therefore to make it easier to himas he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions byword of mouth than on paper it was resolved that instead of writingto fanny he should go to london and personally intreat her goodoffices in his favour</s>  and if they really do interest themselvessaid marianne in her new character of candour in bringing about areconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny are not entirelywithout merit</s> after a visit on colonel brandons side of only three or four days thetwo gentlemen quitted barton together</s>  they were to go immediately todelaford that edward might have some personal knowledge of his futurehome and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvementswere needed to it and from thence after staying there a couple ofnights he was to proceed on his journey to town</s> chapter 50after a proper resistance on the part of mrs</s>  ferrars just so violentand so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she alwaysseemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable edwardwas admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son</s> her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating</s>  for many years ofher life she had had two sons but the crime and annihilation of edwarda few weeks ago had robbed her of one the similar annihilation ofrobert had left her for a fortnight without any and now by theresuscitation of edward she had one again</s> in spite of his being allowed once more to live however he did notfeel the continuance of his existence secure till he had revealed hispresent engagement for the publication of that circumstance hefeared might give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry him offas rapidly as before</s>  with apprehensive caution therefore it wasrevealed and he was listened to with unexpected calmness</s>  mrs</s> ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marryingmiss dashwood by every argument in her powertold him that in missmorton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortuneandenforced the assertion by observing that miss morton was the daughterof a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was onlythe daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three but whenshe found that though perfectly admitting the truth of herrepresentation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it shejudged it wisest from the experience of the past to submitandtherefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her owndignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of goodwill sheissued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor</s> what she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next tobe considered and here it plainly appeared that though edward was nowher only son he was by no means her eldest for while robert wasinevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear not the smallestobjection was made against edwards taking orders for the sake of twohundred and fifty at the utmost nor was anything promised either forthe present or in future beyond the ten thousand pounds which hadbeen given with fanny</s> it was as much however as was desired and more than was expected byedward and elinor and mrs</s>  ferrars herself by her shuffling excusesseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more</s> with an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to themthey had nothing to wait for after edward was in possession of theliving but the readiness of the house to which colonel brandon withan eager desire for the accommodation of elinor was makingconsiderable improvements and after waiting some time for theircompletion after experiencing as usual a thousand disappointmentsand delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinoras usual broke through the first positive resolution of not marryingtill every thing was ready and the ceremony took place in bartonchurch early in the autumn</s> the first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at themansionhouse from whence they could superintend the progress of theparsonage and direct every thing as they liked on the spotcouldchuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep</s>  mrs</s>  jenningssprophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled forshe was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage bymichaelmas and she found in elinor and her husband as she reallybelieved one of the happiest couples in the world</s>  they had in factnothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel brandon and marianneand rather better pasturage for their cows</s> they were visited on their first settling by almost all their relationsand friends</s>  mrs</s>  ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she wasalmost ashamed of having authorised and even the dashwoods were at theexpense of a journey from sussex to do them honour</s> i will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister said john asthey were walking together one morning before the gates of delafordhouse that would be saying too much for certainly you have been oneof the most fortunate young women in the world as it is</s>  but iconfess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandonbrother</s>  his property here his place his house every thing is insuch respectable and excellent condition</s> and his woods</s> i have notseen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there is now standing indelaford hanger</s> and though perhaps marianne may not seem exactlythe person to attract himyet i think it would altogether be advisablefor you to have them now frequently staying with you for as colonelbrandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what mayhappenfor when people are much thrown together and see little ofanybody elseand it will always be in your power to set her off toadvantage and so forthin short you may as well give her achanceyou understand me</s> but though mrs</s>  ferrars did come to see them and always treated themwith the makebelieve of decent affection they were never insulted byher real favour and preference</s>  that was due to the folly of robertand the cunning of his wife and it was earned by them before manymonths had passed away</s>  the selfish sagacity of the latter which hadat first drawn robert into the scrape was the principal instrument ofhis deliverance from it for her respectful humility assiduousattentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening wasgiven for their exercise reconciled mrs</s>  ferrars to his choice andreestablished him completely in her favour</s> the whole of lucys behaviour in the affair and the prosperity whichcrowned it therefore may be held forth as a most encouraging instanceof what an earnest an unceasing attention to selfinterest howeverits progress may be apparently obstructed will do in securing everyadvantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time andconscience</s>  when robert first sought her acquaintance and privatelyvisited her in bartletts buildings it was only with the view imputedto him by his brother</s>  he merely meant to persuade her to give up theengagement and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affectionof both he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settlethe matter</s>  in that point however and that only he erredforthough lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince herin time another visit another conversation was always wanted toproduce this conviction</s>  some doubts always lingered in her mind whenthey parted which could only be removed by another half hoursdiscourse with himself</s>  his attendance was by this means secured andthe rest followed in course</s>  instead of talking of edward they camegradually to talk only of roberta subject on which he had alwaysmore to say than on any other and in which she soon betrayed

wasadopted</s>  the forgiveness at first indeed as was reasonablecomprehended only robert and lucy who had owed his mother no duty andtherefore could have transgressed none still remained some weekslonger unpardoned</s>  but perseverance in humility of conduct andmessages in selfcondemnation for roberts offence and gratitude forthe unkindness she was treated with procured her in time the haughtynotice which overcame her by its graciousness and led soon afterwardsby rapid degrees to the highest state of affection and influence</s> lucy became as necessary to mrs</s>  ferrars as either robert or fannyand while edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intendedto marry her and elinor though superior to her in fortune and birthwas spoken of as an intruder she was in every

what robert had done to succeed toit might have puzzled them still more</s>  it was an arrangementhowever justified in its effects if not in its cause for nothingever appeared in roberts style of living or of talking to give asuspicion of his regretting the extent of his income as either leavinghis brother too little or bringing himself too muchand if edwardmight be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in everyparticular from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home andfrom the regular cheerfulness of his spirits he might be supposed noless contented with his lot no
