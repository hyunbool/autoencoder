the rules ofcomposition result will not only bring them home to us with greaterforce but will discover to us other rules of like origin</s>  3</s>  on seeking for some clue to the law underlying these currentmaxims we may see shadowed forth in many of them the importance ofeconomizing the readers or hearers attention to so present ideas thatthey may be apprehended with the least possible mental effort is thedesideratum towards which most of the rules above quoted point</s>  when wecondemn writing that is wordy or confused or intricatewhen we praisethis style as easy and blame that as fatiguing we consciously orunconsciously assume this desideratum as our standard of judgment</s> regarding language as an apparatus of symbols for the conveyance ofthought we may say that as in a mechanical apparatus the more simpleand the better arranged its parts the greater will be the effectproduced</s>  in either case whatever force is absorbed by the machine isdeducted from the result</s>  a reader or listener has at each moment but alimited amount of mental power available</s>  to recognize and interpret thesymbols presented to him requires part of this power to arrange

understand eachsentence the less time and attention can be given to the containedidea and the less vividly will that idea be conceived</s>  4</s>  how truly language must be regarded as a hindrance to

the strongest effects are produced byinterjections which condense entire sentences into syllables</s>
 and inother cases where custom allows us to express thoughts by single wordsas in beware heigho fudge much force would be lost by expandingthem into specific propositions</s>  hence carrying out the metaphor thatlanguage is the vehicle of thought there seems reason to think thatin all cases the friction and inertia of the vehicle deduct from itsefficiency and that in composition the chief if not the sole thingto be done is to reduce this friction and inertia to the smallestpossible amount</s>  let us then inquire whether economy of the recipientsattention is not the secret of effect alike in the right choice andcollocation of words in the best arrangement of clauses in a sentencein the proper order of its principal and subordinate propositions inthe judicious use of simile metaphor and other figures of speech andeven in the rhythmical sequence of syllables</s> ii</s>  economy in the use of words</s>  5</s>  the greater forcibleness of saxon english or rather nonlatinenglish first claims our attention</s>  the several special reasonsassignable for this may all be reduced to the general reasoneconomy</s> the most important of them is early association</s>  a childs vocabulary isalmost wholly saxon</s>  he says i have not i possessi wishnot i desire he does not reflect he thinks he does not begfor amusement but for play he calls things nice or nastynot pleasant or disagreeable</s>  the synonyms which he learns in afteryears never become so closely so organically connected with the ideassignified as do these original words used in childhood and hence theassociation remains less strong</s>  but in what does a strong associationbetween a word and an idea differ from a weak one</s>  simply in the greaterease and rapidity of the suggestive action</s>  it can be in nothing else</s> both of two words if they be strictly synonymous eventually call upthe same image</s>  the expressionit is acid must in the end give riseto the same thought asit is sour but because the term acid waslearnt later in life and has not been so often followed by the thoughtsymbolized it does not so readily arouse that thought as the term sour</s> if we remember how slowly and with what labour the appropriate ideasfollow unfamiliar words in another language and how increasingfamiliarity with such words brings greater rapidity and ease ofcomprehension and if we consider that the same process must have goneon with the words of our mother tongue from childhood upwards we shallclearly see that the earliest learnt and oftenest used words willother things equal call up images with less loss of time and energythan their later learnt synonyms</s>  6</s>  the further superiority possessed by saxon english in itscomparative brevity obviously comes under the same generalization</s>  ifit be an advantage to express an idea in the smallest number of wordsthen will it be an advantage to express it in the smallest number ofsyllables</s>  if circuitous phrases and needless expletives distract theattention and diminish the strength of the impression produced thendo surplus articulations do so</s>  a certain effort though commonlyan inappreciable one must be required to recognize every vowel andconsonant</s>  if as all know it is tiresome to listen to an indistinctspeaker or read a badlywritten manuscript and if as we cannot doubtthe fatigue is a cumulative result of the attention needed to catchsuccessive syllables it follows that attention is in such casesabsorbed by each syllable</s>  and if this be true when the syllables aredifficult of recognition it will also be true though in a less degreewhen the recognition of them is easy</s>  hence the shortness of saxonwords becomes a reason for their greater force</s>  one qualificationhowever must not be overlooked</s>  a word which in itself embodies themost important part of the idea to be conveyed especially when thatidea is an emotional one may often with advantage be a polysyllabicword</s>  thus it seems more forcible to say it is magnificentthan it is grand</s>  the word vast is not so powerful a one asstupendous</s>  calling a thing nasty is not so effective as calling itdisgusting</s>  7</s>  there seem to be several causes for this exceptional superiorityof certain long words</s>  we may ascribe it partly to the fact that avoluminous mouthfilling epithet is by its very size suggestive oflargeness or strength witness the immense pomposity of sesquipedalianverbiage and when great power or intensity has to be suggested thisassociation of ideas aids the effect</s>  a further cause may be that aword of several syllables admits of more emphatic articulation and asemphatic articulation is a sign of emotion the unusual impressivenessof the thing named is implied by it</s>  yet another cause is that a longword of which the latter syllables are generally inferred as soon asthe first are spoken allows the hearers consciousness a longer time todwell upon the quality predicated and where as in the above cases itis to this predicated quality that the entire attention is called anadvantage results from keeping it before the mind for an appreciabletime</s>  the reasons which we have given for preferring short wordsevidently do not hold here</s>  so that to make our generalization quitecorrect we must say that while in certain sentences expressing strongfeeling the word which more especially implies that feeling may oftenwith advantage be a manysyllabled or latin one in the immense majorityof cases each word serving but as a step to the idea embodied by thewhole sentence should if possible be a onesyllabled or saxon one</s>  8</s>  once more that frequent cause of strength in saxon and otherprimitive wordstheir imitative character may be similarly resolved intothe more general cause</s>  both those directly imitative as splash bangwhiz roar c</s>  and those analogically imitative as rough smoothkeen blunt thin hard crag c</s>  have a greater or less likeness tothe things symbolized and by making on the senses impressions allied tothe ideas to be called up they save part of the effort needed to callup such ideas and leave more attention for the ideas themselves</s>  9</s>  the economy of the recipients mental energy into which are thusresolvable the several causes of the strength of saxon english mayequally be traced in the superiority of specific over generic words</s> that concrete terms produce more vivid impressions than abstract onesand should when possible be used instead is a thorough maxim ofcomposition</s>  as dr</s>  campbell says the more general the terms are thepicture is the fainter the more special they are tis the brighter</s> we should avoid such a sentence asin proportion as the mannerscustoms and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous theregulations of their penal code will be severe</s>  and in place of it weshould writein proportion as men delight in battles bullfightsand combats of gladiators will they punish by hanging burning and therack</s>
 this superiority of specific expressions is clearly due to asaving of the effort required to translate words into thoughts</s>  as wedo not think in generals but in particularsas whenever any class ofthings is referred to we represent it to ourselves by calling to mindindividual members of it it follows that when an abstract word is usedthe bearer or reader has to choose from his stock of images one ormore by which he may figure to himself the genus mentioned</s>  in doingthis some delay must arise some force be expended and if by employinga specific term an appropriate image can be at once suggested aneconomy is achieved and a more vivid impression produced</s> iii</s>  the principle of economy applied to sentences</s>
 turning now from the choice of words to their sequence we shallfind the same general principle hold good</s>  we have a priori reasonsfor believing that in every sentence there is some one order of wordsmore effective than any other and that this order is the one whichpresents the elements of the proposition in the succession in which theymay be most readily put together</s>  as in a narrative the events shouldbe stated in such sequence that the mind may not have to go backwardsand forwards in order to rightly connect them as in a group ofsentences the arrangement should be such that each of them may beunderstood as it comes without waiting for subsequent ones so inevery sentence the sequence of words should be that which suggeststhe constituents of the thought in the order most convenient for thebuilding up that thought</s>  duly to enforce this truth and to prepare theway for applications of it we must briefly inquire into the mental actby which the meaning of a series of words is apprehended</s>
 we cannot more simply do this than by considering the propercollocation of the substantive and adjective</s>  is it better to placethe adjective before the substantive or the substantive before theadjective</s>  ought we to say with the frenchun cheval noir or to sayas we doa black horse</s>  probably most persons of culture would decidethat one order is as good as the other</s>  alive to the bias produced byhabit they would ascribe to that the preference they feel for our ownform of expression</s>  they would expect those educated in the use of theopposite form to have an equal preference for that</s>  and thus they wouldconclude that neither of these instinctive judgments is of any worth</s> there is however a philosophical ground for deciding in favour of theenglish custom</s>  if a horse black be the arrangement immediately onthe utterance of the word horse there arises or tends to arisein the mind a picture answering to that word and as there has beennothing to indicate what kind of horse any image of a horse suggestsitself</s>  very likely however the image will be that of a brown horsebrown horses being the most familiar</s>  the result is that when the wordblack is added a check is given to the process of thought</s>  either thepicture of a brown horse already present to the imagination has to besuppressed and the picture of a black one summoned in its place orelse if the picture of a brown horse be yet unformed the tendency toform it has to be stopped</s>  whichever is the case a certain amount ofhindrance results</s>  but if on the other hand a black horse bethe expression used no such mistake can be made</s>  the word blackindicating an abstract quality arouses no definite idea</s>  it simplyprepares the mind for conceiving some object of that colour and theattention is kept suspended until that object is known</s>  if then by theprecedence of the adjective the idea is conveyed without liability toerror whereas the precedence of the substantive is apt to produce amisconception it follows that the one gives the mind less trouble thanthe other and is therefore more forcible</s>  13</s>  possibly it will be objected that the adjective and substantivecome so close together that practically they may be considered asuttered at the same moment and that on hearing the phrase a horseblack there is not time to imagine a wronglycoloured horse before theword black follows to prevent it</s>  it must be owned that it is noteasy to decide by introspection whether this is so or not</s>  but there arefacts collaterally implying that it is not</s>  our ability to anticipatethe words yet unspoken is one of them if the ideas of the hearer keptconsiderably behind the expressions of the speaker as the objectionassumes he could hardly foresee the end of a sentence by the time itwas half delivered yet this constantly happens</s>  were the suppositiontrue the mind instead of anticipating would be continually fallingmore and more in arrear</s>  if the meanings of words are not realized asfast as the words are uttered then the loss of time over each wordmust entail such an accumulation of delays as to leave a hearer entirelybehind</s>  but whether the force of these replies be or be not admittedit will scarcely be denied that the right formation of a picture willbe facilitated by presenting its elements in the order in which theyare wanted even though the mind should do nothing until it has receivedthem all</s>

 pursuing the principle yet further it is obvious that forproducing the greatest effect not only should the main divisions of asentence observe this sequence but the subdivisions of these should besimilarly arranged</s>  in nearly all cases the predicate is accompanied bysome limit or qualification called its complement</s>  commonly alsothe circumstances of the subject which form its complement have to bespecified</s>  and as these qualifications and circumstances must determinethe mode in which the acts and things they belong to are conceivedprecedence should be given to them</s>  lord kaimes notices the factthat this order is preferable though without giving the reason</s>  hesayswhen a circumstance is placed at the beginning of the period ornear the beginning the transition from it to the principal subject isagreeable it is like ascending or going upward</s>  a sentence arranged inillustration of this will be desirable</s>  here is onewhatever it maybe in theory it is clear that in practice the french idea of libertyisthe right of every man to be master of the rest</s>  18</s>  in this case were the first two clauses up to the word ipractice inclusive which qualify the subject to be placed at theend instead of the beginning much of the force would be lost asthusthe french idea of liberty isthe right of every man to bemaster of the rest in practice at least if not in theory</s>

 the habitual use of sentences in which all or most of thedescriptive and limiting elements precede those described and limitedgives rise to what is called the inverted style a title which ishowever by no means confined to this structure but is often used wherethe order of the words is simply unusual</s>  a more appropriate titlewould be the direct style as contrasted with the other or indirectstyle the peculiarity of the one being that it conveys each thoughtinto the mind step by step with little liability to error and ofthe other that it gets the right thought conceived by a series ofapproximations</s>
 the superiority of the direct over the indirect form of sentenceimplied by the several conclusions that have been drawn must nothowever be affirmed without reservation</s>  though up to a certain pointit is well for the qualifying clauses of a period to precede thosequalified yet as carrying forward each qualifying clause costs somemental effort it follows that when the number of them and the time theyare carried become great we reach a limit beyond which more is lostthan is gained</s>  other things equal the arrangement should be such thatno concrete image shall be suggested until the materials out of which itis to be made have been presented</s>  and yet as lately pointed outother things equal the fewer the materials to be held at once and theshorter the distance they have to be borne the better</s>  hence in somecases it becomes a question whether most mental effort will be entailedby the many and long suspensions or by the correction of successivemisconceptions</s>  28</s>  this question may sometimes be decided by considering the capacityof the persons addressed</s>  a greater grasp of mind is required for theready comprehension of thoughts expressed in the direct mannerwhere the sentences are anywise intricate</s>  to recollect a number ofpreliminaries stated in elucidation of a coming idea and to apply themall to the formation of it when suggested demands a good memory andconsiderable power of concentration</s>  to one possessing these the directmethod will mostly seem the best while to one deficient in them it willseem the worst</s>  just as it may cost a strong man less effort to carry ahundredweight from place to place at once than by a stone at atime so to an active mind it may be easier to bear along all thequalifications of an idea and at once rightly form it when named thanto first imperfectly conceive such idea and then carry back to itone by one the details and limitations afterwards mentioned</s>  whileconversely as for a boy the only possible mode of transferring ahundredweight is that of taking it in portions so for a weak mindthe only possible mode of forming a compound conception may be that ofbuilding it up by carrying separately its several parts</s>  29</s>  that the indirect methodthe method of conveying the meaning bya series of approximationsis best fitted for the uncultivated mayindeed be inferred from their habitual use of it</s>  the form of expressionadopted by the savage as in water give me is the simplest typeof the approximate arrangement</s>  in pleonasms which are comparativelyprevalent among the uneducated the same essential structure is seenas for instance inthe men they were there</s>  again the oldpossessive casethe king his crown conforms to the like order ofthought</s>  moreover the fact that the indirect mode is called the naturalone implies that it is the one spontaneously employed by the commonpeople that isthe one easiest for undisciplined minds</s>

 passing on to a more complex application of the doctrine withwhich we set out it must now be remarked that not only in thestructure of sentences and the use of figures of speech may economyof the recipients mental energy be assigned as the cause of force butthat in the choice and arrangement of the minor images out of whichsome large thought is to be built up we may trace the same conditionto effect</s>  to select from the sentiment scene or event described thosetypical elements which carry many others along with them and so bysaying a few things but suggestingmany to abridge the description is the secret of producing a vividimpression</s>  an extract from tennysons mariana will well illustratethis all day within the dreamy house  the door upon the hinges creaked  the blue fly sung i the pane the mouse  behind the mouldering wainscot shrieked  or from the crevice peered about</s>  48</s>  the several circumstances here specified bring with them manyappropriate associations</s>  our attention is rarely drawn by the buzzingof a fly in the window save when everything is still</s>  while the inmatesare moving about the house mice usually keep silence and it is onlywhen extreme quietness reigns that they peep from their retreats</s>  henceeach of the facts mentioned presupposing numerous others calls upthese with more or less distinctness and revives the feeling of dullsolitude with which they are connected in our experience</s>  were all thesefacts detailed instead of suggested the attention would be so fritteredaway that little impression of dreariness would be produced</s>  similarlyin other cases</s>  whatever the nature of the thought to be conveyed thisskilful selection of a few particulars which imply the rest is thekey to success</s>  in the choice of component ideas as in the choice ofexpressions the aim must be to convey the greatest quantity of thoughtswith the smallest quantity of words</s>  49</s>  the same principle may in some cases be advantageously carriedyet further by indirectly suggesting some entirely distinct thoughtin addition to the one expressed</s>  thus if we say the head of a goodclassic is as full of ancient myths as that of a servantgirl of ghoststories it is manifest that besides the fact asserted there is animplied opinion respecting the small value of classical knowledge andas this implied opinion is recognized much sooner than it can be putinto words there is gain in omitting it</s>  in other cases again greateffect is produced by an overt omission provided the nature of theidea left out is obvious</s>  a good instance of this occurs in heroes andheroworship</s>  after describing the way in which burns was sacrificed tothe idle curiosity of lionhunterspeople who came not out of sympathybut merely to see himpeople who sought a little amusement and who gottheir amusement while the heros life went for it</s>  carlyle suggests aparallel thus richter says in the island of sumatra there is a kindof lightchafers large fireflies which people stick upon spits andilluminate the ways with at night</s>  persons of condition can thus travelwith a pleasant radiance which they much admire</s>  great honour to thefireflies</s>  but</s> vi</s>  the effect of poetry explained</s>
 before inquiring whether the law of effect thus far tracedexplains the superiority of poetry to prose it will be needful tonotice some supplementary causes of force in expression that have notyet been mentioned</s>  these are not properly speaking additional causesbut rather secondary ones originating from those already specifiedreflex results of them</s>  in the first place then we may remark thatmental excitement spontaneously prompts the use of those forms of speechwhich have been pointed out as the most effective</s>  out with him</s>  awaywith him</s>  are the natural utterances of angry citizens at a disturbedmeeting</s>  a voyager describing a terrible storm he had witnessed wouldrise to some such climax ascrack went the ropes and down came themast</s>  astonishment may be heard expressed in the phrasenever wasthere such a sight</s>  all of which sentences are it will be observedconstructed after the direct type</s>  again every one knows that excitedpersons are given to figures of speech</s>  the vituperation of the vulgarabounds with them often indeed consists of little else</s>  beastbrute gallows rogue cutthroat villain these and other likemetaphors and metaphorical epithets at once call to mind a streetquarrel</s>  further it may be noticed that extreme brevity is anothercharacteristic of passionate language</s>  the sentences are generallyincomplete the particles are omitted and frequently important wordsare left to be gathered from the context</s>  great admiration does notvent itself in a precise proposition asit is beautiful but in thesimple exclamationbeautiful</s>  he who when reading a lawyers lettershould say vile rascal</s>  would be thought angry while he is a vilerascal</s>  would imply comparative coolness</s>  thus we see that alike inthe order of the words in the frequent use of figures and in extremeconciseness the natural utterances of excitement conform to thetheoretical conditions of forcible expression</s>  51</s>  hence then the higher forms of speech acquire a secondarystrength from association</s>  having in actual life habitually heard themin connection with vivid mental impressions and having been accustomedto meet with them in the most powerful writing they come to have inthemselves a species of force</s>  the emotions that have from time to timebeen produced by the strong thoughts wrapped up in these forms arepartially aroused by the forms themselves</s>  they create a certain degreeof animation they induce a preparatory sympathy and when the strikingideas looked for are reached they are the more vividly realized</s>  52</s>  the continuous use of these modes of expression that are alikeforcible in themselves and forcible from their associations producesthe peculiarly impressive species of composition which we call poetry</s> poetry we shall find habitually adopts those symbols of thoughtand those methods of using them which instinct and analysis agree inchoosing as most effective and becomes poetry by virtue of doing this</s> on turning back to the various specimens that have been quoted it willbe seen that the direct or inverted form of sentence predominates inthem and that to a degree quite inadmissible in prose</s>  and not onlyin the frequency but in what is termed the violence of the inversionswill this distinction be remarked</s>  in the abundant use of figuresagain we may recognize the same truth</s>  metaphors similes hyperbolesand personifications are the poets colours which he has liberty toemploy almost without limit</s>  we characterize as poetical the prosewhich uses these appliances of language with any frequency and condemnit as over florid or affected long before they occur with theprofusion allowed in verse</s>  further let it be remarked that inbrevitythe other requisite of forcible expression which theory pointsout and emotion spontaneously fulfilspoetical phraseology similarlydiffers from ordinary phraseology</s>  imperfect periods are frequentelisions are perpetual and many of the minor words which would bedeemed essential in prose are dispensed with</s>  53</s>  thus poetry regarded as a vehicle of thought is especiallyimpressive partly because it obeys all the laws of effective speechand partly because in so doing it imitates the natural utterances ofexcitement</s>  while the matter embodied is idealized emotion the vehicleis the idealized language of emotion</s>  as the musical composer catchesthe cadences in which our feelings of joy and sympathy grief anddespair vent themselves and out of these germs evolves melodiessuggesting higher phases of these feelings i so the poet develops fromthe typical expressions in which men utter passion and sentiment thosechoice forms of verbal combination in which concentrated passion andsentiment may be fitly presented</s>  54</s>  there is one peculiarity of poetry conducing much to itseffectthe peculiarity which is indeed usually thought itscharacteristic onestill remaining to be considered we mean itsrhythmical structure</s>  this improbable though it seems will be found tocome under the same generalization with the others</s>  like each of themit is an idealization of the natural language of strong emotion whichis known to be more or less metrical if the emotion be not too violentand like each of them it is an economy of the readers or hearersattention</s>  in the peculiar tone and manner we adopt in utteringversified language may be discerned its relationship to the feelingsand the pleasure which its measured movement gives us is ascribableto the comparative ease with which words metrically arranged can berecognized</s>
 55</s>  this last position will scarcely be at once admitted but a littleexplanation will show its reasonableness</s>
 for if as we have seenthere is an expenditure of mental energy in the mere act of listening toverbal articulations or in that silent repetition of them which goeson in readingif the perceptive faculties must be in active exerciseto identify every syllablethen any mode of so combining words asto present a regular recurrence of certain traits which the mind cananticipate will diminish that strain upon the attention required by thetotal irregularity of prose</s>  just as the body in receiving a seriesof varying concussions must keep the muscles ready to meet the mostviolent of them as not knowing when such may come so the mind inreceiving unarranged articulations must keep its perceptives activeenough to recognize the least easily caught sounds</s>  and as if theconcussions recur in a definite order the body may husband its forcesby adjusting the resistance needful for each concussion so if thesyllables be rhythmically arranged the mind may economize its energiesby anticipating the attention required for each syllable</s>  56</s>  farfetched though this idea will perhaps be thought a littleintrospection will countenance it</s>  that we do take advantage of metricallanguage to adjust our perceptive faculties to the force of the expectedarticulations is clear from the fact that we are balked by haltingversification</s>  much as at the bottom of a flight of stairs a step moreor less than we counted upon gives us a shock so too does a misplacedaccent or a supernumerary syllable</s>  in the one case we know thatthere is an erroneous preadjustment and we can scarcely doubtthat there is one in the other</s>  but if we habitually preadjust ourperceptions to the measured movement of verse the physical analogyabove given renders it probable that by so doing we economize attentionand hence that metrical language is more effective than prose becauseit enables us to do this</s>  57</s>  were there space it might be worthwhile to inquire whether thepleasure we take in rhyme and also that which we take in euphony axenot partly ascribable to the same general cause</s> part ii</s>  causes of force in language which depend upon economy of themental sensibilities</s> i</s>  the law of mental exhaustion and repair</s>  58</s>  a few paragraphs only can be devoted to a second division ofour subject that here presents itself</s>  to pursue in detail the laws ofeffect as applying to the larger features of composition would carryus beyond our limits</s>  but we may briefly indicate a further aspect ofthe general principle hitherto traced out and hint a few of its widerapplications</s>  59</s>  thus far then we have considered only those causes of force inlanguage which depend upon economy of the mental energies we havenow to glance at those which depend upon economy of the mentalsensibilities</s>  questionable though this division may be as apsychological one it will yet serve roughly to indicate the remainingfield of investigation</s>  it will suggest that besides considering theextent to which any faculty or group of faculties is tasked in receivinga form of words and realizing its contained idea we have to considerthe state in which this faculty or group of faculties is left and howthe reception of subsequent sentences and images will be influenced bythat state</s>  without going at length into so wide a topic as the exerciseof faculties and its reactive effects it will be sufficient here tocall to mind that every faculty when in a state of normal activity ismost capable at the outset and that the change in its conditionwhich ends in what we term exhaustion begins simultaneously with itsexercise</s>  this generalization with which we are all familiar in ourbodily experiences and which our daily language recognizes as trueof the mind as a whole is equally true of each mental power from thesimplest of the senses to the most complex of the sentiments</s>  if we holda flower to the nose for long we become insensible to its scent</s>  we sayof a very brilliant flash of lightning that it blinds us which meansthat our eyes have for a time lost their ability to appreciate light</s> after eating a quantity of honey we are apt to think our tea is withoutsugar</s>  the phrase a deafening roar implies that men find a very loudsound temporarily incapacitates them for hearing faint ones</s>  to a handwhich has for some time carried a heavy body small bodies afterwardslifted seem to have lost their weight</s>  now the truth at once recognizedin these its extreme manifestations may be traced throughout</s>  it maybe shown that alike in the reflective faculties in the imaginationin the perceptions of the beautiful the ludicrous the sublime inthe sentiments the instincts in all the mental powers however we mayclassify themaction exhausts and that in proportion as the action isviolent the subsequent prostration is great</s>  60</s>  equally throughout the whole nature may be traced the law thatexercised faculties are ever tending to resume their original state</s>  notonly after continued rest do they regain their full power not only dobrief cessations partially reinvigorate them but even while they arein action the resulting exhaustion is ever being neutralized</s>  thetwo processes of waste and repair go on together</s>  hence with facultieshabitually exercisedas the senses of all persons or the muscles ofany one who is strongit happens that during moderate activity therepair is so nearly equal to the waste that the diminution of poweris scarcely appreciable and it is only when the activity has been longcontinued or has been very violent that the repair becomes so farin arrear of the waste as to produce a perceptible prostration</s>  inall cases however when by the action of a faculty waste has beenincurred some lapse of time must take place before full efficiencycan be reacquired and this time must be long in proportion as the wastehas been great</s> ii explanation of climax antithesis and anticlimax</s>  61</s>  keeping in mind these general truths we shall be in a conditionto understand certain causes of effect in composition now to beconsidered</s>  every perception received and every conception realizedentailing some amount of wasteor as liebig would say some change ofmatter in the brain and the efficiency of the faculties subject tothis waste being thereby temporarily though often but momentarilydiminished the resulting partial inability must affect the acts ofperception and conception that immediately succeed</s>  and hence we mayexpect that the vividness with which images are realized will in manycases depend on the order of their presentation even when one order isas convenient to the understanding as the other</s>  62</s>  there are sundry facts which alike illustrate this and areexplained by it</s>  climax is one of them</s>
 in antithesisagain we may recognize the same general truth</s>  the opposition of twothoughts that are the reverse of each other in some prominent traitinsures an impressive effect and does this by giving a momentaryrelaxation to the faculties addressed</s>  if after a series of images ofan ordinary character appealing in a moderate degree to the sentimentof reverence or approbation or beauty the mind has presented to it avery insignificant a very unworthy or a very ugly image the facultyof reverence or approbation or beauty as the case may be havingfor the time nothing to do tends to resume its full power and willimmediately afterwards appreciate a vast admirable or beautifulimage better than it would otherwise do</s>  conversely where the ideaof absurdity due to extreme insignificance is to be produced it maybegreatly intensified by placing it after something highly impressiveespecially if the form of phrase implies that something still moreimpressive is coming</s>  a good illustration of the effect gained by thuspresenting a petty idea to a consciousness that has not yet recoveredfrom the shock of an exciting one occurs in a sketch by balzac</s>

 thus we see that the phenomena of climax antithesis andanticlimax alike result from this general principle</s>  improbable asthese momentary variations in susceptibility may seem we cannot doubttheir

certain arrangements andcertain juxtapositions of connected ideas are best but that some modesof dividing and presenting a subject will be more striking than othersand that too irrespective of its logical cohesion</s>  it shows why wemust progress from the less interesting to the more interesting andwhy not only the composition as a whole but each of its successiveportions should tend towards a climax</s>  at the same time it forbidslong continuity of the same kind of thought or repeated production oflike effects</s>  it warns us against the error committed both by pope inhis poems and by bacon in his essaysthe error namely of constantlyemploying forcible forms of expression and it points out that asthe easiest posture by and by becomes fatiguing and is with pleasureexchanged for one less easy so the most perfectlyconstructedsentences will soon weary and relief will be given by using those of aninferior kind</s>  65</s>  further we may infer from it not only that we should avoidgenerally combining our words in one manner however good or workingout our figures and illustrations in one way however telling butthat we should avoid anything like uniform adherence even to the widerconditions of effect</s>  we should not make every section of our subjectprogress in interest we should not always rise to a climax</s>  as we sawthat in single sentences it is but rarely allowable to fulfill all theconditions to strength so in the larger sections of a compositionwe must not often conform entirely to the law indicated</s>  we mustsubordinate the component effect to the total effect</s>  66</s>  in deciding how practically to carry out the principles ofartistic composition we may derive help by bearing in mind a factalready pointed outthe fitness of certain verbal arrangementsfor certain kinds of thought</s>  that constant variety in the mode ofpresenting ideas which the theory demands will in a great degree resultfrom a skilful adaptation of the form to the matter</s>  we saw how thedirect or inverted sentence is spontaneously used by excited peopleand how their language is also characterized by figures of speech and byextreme brevity</s>  hence these may with advantage predominate in emotionalpassages and may increase as the emotion rises</s>  on the other handfor complex ideas the indirect sentence seems the best vehicle</s>  inconversation the excitement produced by the near approach to adesired conclusion will often show itself in a series of short sharpsentences while in impressing a view already enunciated we generallymake our periods

iv</s>  the ideal writer</s>  67</s>  this species of composition which the law of effect points outas the perfect one is the one which high genius tends naturally toproduce</s>  as we found that the kinds of sentences which are theoreticallybest are those generally employed by superior minds and by inferiorminds when excitement has raised them so we shall find that the idealform for a poem essay

specificstyle is to be poor in speech</s>  if we remember that in the far past menhad only nouns and verbs to convey their ideas with and that from thento now the growth has been towards a greater

use of words and thata continuance of the process that has hitherto gone on must produceincreasing heterogeneity in our modes of expression</s>  as now in afine nature the play of the features the
