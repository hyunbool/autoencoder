preface</s> while some of our wars in india are open to the charge that they wereundertaken on slight provocation and were forced on by us in orderthat we might have an excuse for annexation our struggle with tippoosaib was on the other hand marked by a long endurance of wrong anda toleration of abominable cruelties perpetrated upon englishmen andour native allies</s>  hyder ali was a conqueror of the true eastern type</s> he was ambitious in the extreme</s>  he dreamed of becoming the lord ofthe whole of southern india</s>  he was an able leader and thoughruthless where it was his policy to strike terror he was not cruelfrom choice</s> his son tippoo on the contrary revelled in acts of the mostabominable cruelty</s>  it would seem that he massacred for the verypleasure of massacring and hundreds of british captives were killedby famine poison or torture simply to gratify his lust for murder</s> patience was shown towards this monster until patience became a faultand our inaction was naturally ascribed by him to fear</s>  had firmnessbeen shown by lord cornwallis when seringapatam was practically inhis power the second war would have been avoided and thousands oflives spared</s>  the blunder was a costly one to us for the work had tobe done all over again and the fault of lord cornwallis retrieved bythe energy and firmness of the marquis of wellesley</s> the story of the campaign is taken from various sources and thedetails of the treatment of the prisoners from the publishednarratives of two officers who effected their escape from prisons</s> g</s>  a</s>  henty</s> chapter 1 a lost father</s> there is no saying lad no saying at all</s>  all i know is that yourfather the captain was washed ashore at the same time as i was</s>  asyou have heard me say i owed my life to him</s>  i was pretty nigh gonewhen i caught sight of him holding on to a spar</s>  spent as i was imanaged to give a shout loud enough to catch his ear</s>  he looked round</s> i waved my hand and shouted goodbye captain</s>  then i sank lower andlower and felt that it was all over when half in a dream i heardyour fathers voice shout hold on ben</s>  i gave one more struggleand then i felt him catch me by the arm</s>  i dont remember whathappened until i found myself lashed to the spar beside him</s> that is right ben he said cheerily as i held up my head youwill do now</s>  i had a sharp tussle to get you here but it is allright</s>  we are setting inshore fast</s>  pull yourself together for weshall have a rough time of it in the surf</s>  anyhow we will sticktogether come what may</s> as the waves lifted us up i saw the coast with its groves ofcoconuts almost down to the waters edge and white sheets of surfrunning up high on the sandy beach</s>  it was not more than a hundredyards away and the captain sang outhurrah</s>  there are some natives coming down</s>  they will give us ahand</s> next time we came up on a wave he said when we get close ben wemust cut ourselves adrift from this spar or it will crush the lifeout of us but before we do that i will tie the two of us together</s> he cut a bit of rope from the raffle hanging from the spar and tiedone end round my waist and the other round his own leaving about fivefathoms loose between us</s> there he shouted in my ear</s>  if either of us gets chucked well upand the natives get a hold of him the other must come up too</s>  nowmind ben keep broadside on to the wave if you can and let it rollyou up as far as it will take you</s>  then when you feel that its forceis spent stick your fingers and toes into the sand and hold on likegrim death</s> well we drifted nearer and nearer until just as we got to the pointwhere the great waves tumbled over the captain cut the lashings andswam a little away so as to be clear of the spar</s>  then a big wavecame towering up</s>  i was carried along like a straw in a whirlpool</s> then there was a crash that pretty nigh knocked the senses out of me</s> i do not know what happened afterwards</s>  it was a confusion of whitewater rushing past and over me</s>  then for a moment i stopped and atonce made a clutch at the ground that i had been rolling over</s>  therewas a big strain and i was hauled backwards as if a team of wildhorses were pulling at me</s>  then there was a jerk and i knew nothingmore till i woke up and found myself on the sands out of reach ofthe surf</s> your father did not come to for half an hour</s>  he had been hurt a bitworse than i had but at last he came round</s> well we were kept three months in a sort of castle place and thenone day a party of chaps with guns and swords came into the yardwhere we were sitting</s>  the man who seemed the head of the fellows whohad been keeping us prisoners walked up with one who was evidently anofficer over the chaps as had just arrived</s>  he looked at us both andthen laid his hand on the captain</s>  then the others came up</s> the captain had just time to say we are going to be parted ben</s> god bless you</s>  if ever you get back give my love to my wife and tellher what has happened to me and that she must keep up her heart fori shall make a bolt of it the first time i get a chance</s> the next day i was taken off to a place they call calicut</s>  there istopped a year and then the rajah of the place joined the englishagainst tippoo who was lord of all the country and i was released</s>  ihad got by that time to talk their lingo pretty well though i haveforgotten it all now and i had found out that the chaps who had takenyour father away were a party sent down by tippoo who having heardthat two englishmen had been cast on shore had insisted upon one ofthem being handed over to him</s> it is known that a great many of the prisoners in tippoos hands havebeen murdered in their dungeons</s>  he has sworn over and over againthat he has no european prisoners but every one knows that he hasnumbers of them in his hands</s>  whether the captain is one of those whohave been murdered or whether he is still in one of tippoosdungeons is more than i or any one else can say</s> well as i have told you ben that is what we mean to find out</s> i know that is what your mother has often said lad but it seems tome that you have more chance of finding the man in the moon than youhave of learning whether your father is alive or not</s> well we are going to try anyhow ben</s>  i know its a difficult jobbut mother and i have talked it over ever since you came home withthe news three years ago so i have made up my mind and nothing canchange me</s>  you see i have more chances than most people would have</s> being a boy is all in my favour and then you know i talk thelanguage just as well as english</s> yes of course that is a pull and a big one but it is a desperateundertaking lad and i cant say as i see how it is to be done</s> i dont see either ben and i dont expect to see until we get outthere but desperate or not mother and i are going to try</s> dick holland the speaker was a lad of some fifteen years of age</s>  hisfather who was captain of a fine east indiaman had sailed fromlondon when he was nine and had never returned</s>  no news had beenreceived of the ship after she touched at the cape and it wassupposed that she had gone down with all hands until nearly threeyears later her boatswain ben birket had entered the east indiacompanys office and reported that he himself and the captain hadbeen cast ashore on the territories of the rajah of coorg the solesurvivors as far as he knew of the hooghley</s> after an interview with the directors he had gone straight to thehouse at shadwell inhabited by mrs</s>  holland</s>  she had left there buthad removed to a smaller one a short distance away where she livedupon the interest of the sum that her husband had invested from hissavings and from a small pension granted to her by the company</s> mrs</s>  holland was a half caste the daughter of an english woman whohad married a young rajah</s>  her mothers life had been a happy one butwhen her daughter had reached the age of sixteen she died obtainingon her deathbed the rajahs consent that the girl should be sent toengland to be educated while her son who was three years youngershould remain with his father</s> over him she had exercised but little influence</s>  he had been broughtup like the sons of other native princes and save for his somewhatlight complexion the english blood in his veins would never have beensuspected</s> margaret on the other hand had been under her mothers care and asthe latter had always hoped that the girl would at any rate for atime go to her family in england she had always conversed with herin that language and had until her decreasing strength rendered itno longer possible given her an english education</s> in complexion and appearance she took far more after her englishmother than the boy had done and save for her soft dark eyes andglossy jetblack hair might have passed as of pure english blood</s> when she sailed it was with the intention of returning to india inthe course of a few years but this arrangement was overthrown by thefact that on the voyage john holland the handsome young first mateof the indiaman completely won her heart and they were married afortnight after the vessel came up the thames</s> the matter would not have been so hurried had not a letter she postedon landing to her mothers sister who had promised her a homereceived an answer written in a strain which determined her to yieldat once to john hollands pressing entreaties that they should bemarried without delay</s>  her aunt had replied that she had consented tooverlook the conduct of her mother in uniting herself to a nativeand to receive her for a year at the rectory but that her behaviourin so precipitately engaging herself to a rough sailor rendered itimpossible to countenance her</s>  as she stated that she had come overwith a sum sufficient to pay her expenses while in england sheadvised her to ask the captainwho by the way must have grosslyneglected his duties by allowing an intimacy between her and hismateto place her in some school where she would be well lookedafter until her return to india</s> the indian blood in margarets veins boiled fiercely and she wroteher aunt a letter which caused that lady to congratulate herself onthe good fortune that had prevented her from having to receive underher roof a girl of so objectionable and violent a character</s> although the language that john holland used concerning this letterwas strong indeed he was well satisfied as he had foreseen that itwas not probable margarets friends would have allowed her to marryhim without communicating with her father and that the rajah mighthave projects of his own for her disposal</s>  he laid the case before thecaptain who placed her in charge of his wife until the marriage tookplace</s> except for the long absences of her husband margarets life had beena very happy one and she was looking forward to the time when afteranother voyage he would be able to give up his profession and settledown upon his savings</s> when months passed by and no news came of the hooghley having reachedport mrs</s>  holland at once gave up her house and moved into a smallerone for although her income would have been sufficient to enable herto remain where she was she determined to save every penny she wasable for the sake of her boy</s>  she was possessed of strong commonsense and firmness of character and when ben birket returned with histale he was surprised at the composure with which she received it</s> i have always she said had a conviction that john was stillalive and have not allowed dick to think of his father as dead andnow i believe as firmly as before that someday john will be restoredto me</s>  i myself can do nothing towards aiding him</s>  a woman can dolittle here</s>  she can do nothing in india save among her own people</s> i shall wait patiently for a time</s>  it may be that this war willresult in his release</s>  but in the meantime i shall continue toprepare dick to take up the search for him as soon as he is oldenough</s> i hear once a year from my brother who is now rajah and he willbe able to aid my boy in many ways</s>  however for a time i must bepatient and wait</s>  i have learnt to wait during my husbands longabsences and besides i think that the women of india are a patientrace</s>  i trust that john will yet come home to me but if not when itis time we will try to rescue him</s> ben said nothing at the time to damp her courage but he shook hishead as he left the cottage</s> poor creature he said</s>  i would not say anything to discourage herbut for a woman and boy to try to get a captive out of the claws ofthe tiger of mysore is just madness</s> each time he returned from a voyage ben called upon mrs</s>  holland</s>  hehimself had given up every vestige of hope when it was known that thename of her husband was not among the list of those whom tippoo hadbeen forced to release</s>  margaret holland however still clung tohope</s>  her face was paler and there was a set pathetic expression init so when she spoke of her husband as being still alive ben wouldsooner have cut out his tongue than allow the slightest wordindicative of his own feeling of certainty as to the captains fateto escape him and he always made a pretence of entering warmly intoher plans</s> the training as she considered it of her son went on steadily</s>  shealways conversed with him in her fathers language and he was able tospeak it as well as english</s>  she was ever impressing upon him that hemust be strong and active</s>  when he was twelve she engaged an oldsoldier who had set up a sort of academy to instruct him in the useof the sword and in such exercises as were calculated to strengthenhis muscles and to give him strength and agility</s> unlike most mothers she had no word of reproach when he returned homefrom school with a puffed face or cut lips the signs of battle</s> i do not want you to be quarrelsome she often said to him but ihave heard your father say that a man who can use his fists well issure to be cool and quick in any emergency</s>  you know what is beforeyou and these qualities are of far more importance in your casethan any book learning</s>  therefore dick i say never quarrel on yourown account but whenever you see a boy bullying a smaller one takethe opportunity of giving him a lesson while learning one yourself</s>  inthe days of old you know the first duty of a true knight was tosuccour the oppressed and i want you to be a true knight</s>  you willget thrashed sometimes no doubt but dont mind that</s>  perhaps nexttime you will turn the tables</s> dick acted upon this advice and by the time he was fifteen hadestablished a reputation among not only the boys of his own schoolbut of the district</s>  in addition to his strength and quickness he hada fund of dogged endurance and imperturbable good temper that didnot fail him even on the rare occasions when in combats with boysmuch older than himself he was forced to admit himself defeated</s> the fact that he fought not because he was angry but as if it were amatter of business gave him a great advantage and his readiness totake up the cause of any boy illtreated by another was so notoriousthat i will tell dick holland became a threat that saved many a boyfrom being burned</s> ten days before his conversation with ben his mother had saiddick i can stand this no longer</s>  i have tried to be patient for sixyears but i can be patient no longer</s>  i feel that another year ofsuspense would kill me</s>  therefore i have made up my mind to sail atonce</s>  the voyage will take us five months and perhaps you may have toremain some little time at my brothers before you can start</s> now that the time is come i think that perhaps i am about to dowrong and that it may cost you your life</s>  but i cannot help it dick</s> i dream of your father almost every night and i wake up thinking thati hear him calling upon me to help him</s>  i feel that i should go madif this were to last much longer</s> i am ready mother the boy said earnestly</s>  i have been hopingfor some time that you would say you would start soon and though ihave not of course the strength of a man i think that will be morethan made up by the advantage i should have as a boy in looking formy father and at any rate from what you tell me i should think thati am quite as strong as an average native of your country</s> anyhow mother i am sure that it will be best for us to go now</s>  itmust have been awful for you waiting all this time and though youhave never said anything about it i have noticed for a long time thatyou were looking ill and was sure that you were worrying terribly</s> what would be the use of staying any longer</s>  i should not be very muchstronger in another year than i am now and a year would seem an ageto father</s> and so it was settled and mrs</s>  holland at once began to makepreparations for their departure</s>  she had already without sayinganything to dick given notice that she should give up the house</s>  shehad during the six years saved a sum of money amply sufficient forthe expenses of the journey and outfit and she had now only to orderclothes for herself and dick and to part with her furniture</s> ben on his return had heard with grave apprehension that she wasabout to carry out her intention but as he saw that any remonstranceon his part would be worse than useless he abstained from offeringany and warmly entered into her plans</s>  after an hours talk he hadproposed to dick to go out for a stroll with him</s> i am glad to have a talk with you ben dick said</s>  of course ihave heard from mother what you told her when you came home but ishall be glad to hear it from you so as to know exactly how it allwas</s>  you know she feels sure that father is still alive</s>  i should liketo know what your opinion really is about it</s>  of course it will makeno difference as i should never say anything to her but i shouldlike to know whether you think there is any possibility of his beingalive</s> to this ben had replied as already related</s>  he was silent when dickasserted that desperate or not he intended to carry out his mothersplan</s> i would not say as i think it altogether desperate as far as you areconcerned he said thoughtfully</s>  it dont seem to me as there ismuch chance of your ever getting news of your father lad and as togetting him out of prison if you do come to hear of him why honesti would not give a quid of baccy for your chance but i dont say asi think that it is an altogether desperate job as far as you areconcerned yourself</s>  talking their lingo as you do its just possibleas you might be able to travel about in disguise without anyonefinding you out especially as the rajah your uncle ought to be ableto help you a bit and put you in the way of things and perhaps sendsome trusty chap along with you</s>  there is no doubt you are strong foryour age and being thin and nothing but muscle you would passbetter as a native than if you had been thick and chunky</s>  my old womantells me as you have a regular name as a fighter and that you havegiven a lesson to many a bully in the neighbourhood</s>  altogether thereis a lot in your favour and i dont see why you should not pullthrough all right at any rate even should the worst come to theworst and you do get news somehow that your poor father has gonedown i am sure it will be better for your mother than going on as shehas done for the last six years just wearing herself out withanxiety</s> i am sure it will ben</s>  i can tell you that it is as much as i cando sometimes not to burst out crying when i see her sitting by thehour with her eyes open but not seeing anything or moving as muchas a fingerjust thinking and thinking and thinking</s> i wish we were going out in your ship ben</s> i wish you was lad but it will be five or six weeks before we areoff again</s>  anyhow the ship you are going inthe madrasis a finecraft and the captain bears as high a character as anyone in thecompanys fleet</s> well lad i hope that it will all turn out well</s>  if i could havetalked the lingo like a native i would have been glad to have gonewith you and taken my chances</s>  the captain saved my life in thatwreck and it would only have been right that i should risk mine forhim if there was but a shadow of chance of its being of use</s>  but iknow that in a job of this sort i could be of no good whatsomeverand should be getting you into trouble before we had gone a miletogether</s> i am sure that you would help if you could ben but of course youcould be of no use</s> and when do you think of being home again lad</s> there is no saying benit may be years</s>  but however long it takesi shant give it up until i find out for certain what has become ofmy father</s> and aint there a chance of hearing how you are getting on dick</s>  ishall think of you and your mother often and often when i am on deckkeeping my watch at night and it will seem hard that i maynt be ableto hear for years as to what you are doing</s> the only thing that i can do ben will be to write if i get a chanceof sending a messenger or for my mother to write to you to theoffice</s> that is it</s>  you send a letter to ben birket boatswain of themadeira care of east india company leadenhall street and i shallget it sooner or later</s>  of course i shall not expect a long yarnbut just two or three words to tell me how you are getting on andwhether you have got any news of your father</s>  and if you come back toengland leave your address at the companys office for me for itaint an easy matter to find anyone out in london unless you havegot their bearings right</s> ten days later mrs</s>  holland and dick embarked on the madras</s>  dick hadbeen warned by his mother to say nothing to anyone on board as tothe object of their voyage</s> i shall mention she said that i am going out to make someinquiries respecting the truth of a report that has reached me thatsome of those on board the hooghley of which my husband was captainsurvived the wreck and were taken up the country</s>  that will be quitesufficient</s>  say nothing about my having been born in india or that myfather was a native rajah</s>  some of these officialsand still moretheir wivesare very prejudiced and consider themselves to be quitedifferent beings to the natives of the country</s>  i found it so on myvoyage to england</s> at any rate we dont want our affairs talked about</s>  it will be quitesufficient for people to know that we are as i said going out tomake some inquiries about the truth of this rumour</s> all right mother</s>  at any rate the captain has told you that he willlook after you and make things comfortable for you so we need notcare about anything else</s> we certainly need not care dick but it is much more agreeable toget on nicely with everyone</s>  i was very pleased when captain barstowcalled yesterday and said that having heard at the office that themrs</s>  holland on the passenger list was the widow of his old shipmatejohn holland he had come round to see if there was anything that hecould do for her and he promised to do all in his power to make uscomfortable</s>  of course i told him that i did not regard myself ascaptain hollands widowthat all we knew was that he had got safelyashore and had been taken up to mysore and as i had a strongconviction he was still alive i was going out to endeavour toascertain from native sources whether he was still living</s> well maam i hope that you will succeed he said</s>  all this isnew to me</s>  i thought he was drowned when the hooghley went ashore</s> anyhow mrs</s>  holland i honour you for making this journey just onthe off chance of hearing something of your husband and you may besure i will do all i can to make the voyage a pleasant one for you</s> so you see we shall start favourably dick for the captain can do agreat deal towards adding to the comfort of a passenger</s>  when it isknown by the purser and steward that a lady is under the specialcare of the captain it ensures her a larger share of civility andspecial attentions than she might otherwise obtain</s> as soon as they went on board indeed the captain came up to them</s> good morning mrs</s>  holland he said</s>  you have done quite right tocome on board early</s>  it gives you a chance of being attended tobefore the stewards are being called for by twenty people at once</s> he beckoned to a midshipman</s> mr</s>  hart please tell the purser i wish to speak to him</s> so this is your son mrs</s>  holland</s>  a fine straightlooking youngfellow</s>  are you going to put him in the service</s>  you have a strongclaim you know which i am sure the board would acknowledge</s> do you know captain it is a matter that i have hardly thoughtofin fact i have for years been so determined to go out and tryand obtain some news of my husband as soon as dick was old enough tojourney about as my protector that i have not thought as i ought tohave done what profession he should follow</s>  however he is onlyfifteen yet and there will be time enough when he gets back</s> if he is to go into the service the sooner the better maamonecan hardly begin too young</s>  however i dont say there are not plentyof good sailors afloat who did not enter until a couple of yearsolder than he isthere is no strict rule as to age</s> only fifteen is he</s>  i should have taken him for at least a yearolder</s>  however if you like mrs</s>  holland i will put him in the wayof learning a good deal during the voyage</s>  he might as well be doingthat as loafing about the deck all day</s> much better captain</s>  i am very much obliged to you and i am surethat he will be too</s> i should like it immensely captain dick exclaimed</s> at this moment the purser came up</s> mr</s>  stevenson the captain said this is mrs</s>  holland</s>  she is thewife of my old friend john hollandwe were midshipmen together onboard the ganges</s>  he commanded the hooghley which was lost you knowfive or six years ago somewhere near calicut</s>  there were two or threesurvivors and he was one of them and it seems that he was taken upthe country so mrs</s>  holland is going out to endeavour to ascertainwhether he may not be still alive though perhaps detained by one ofthose native princes</s> please do everything you can to make her comfortable and tell thehead steward that it is my particular wish she shall be well attendedto</s>  who is she berthed with</s> the purser took the passenger list from his pocket</s> she is with mrs</s>  colonel williamson and the wife of commissionerlarkins</s> the captain gave a grunt of dissatisfaction</s>  the purser went on</s> there is a small cabin vacant captain</s>  two ladies who were to haveita mother and daughterhave i hear this morning beenunexpectedly detained owing to the sudden illness of one of them</s> their heavy baggage is all in the hold and must go on and they willfollow in the next ship</s>  shall i put mrs</s>  holland in there</s> certainly</s>  this is most fortunate</s> i dont think that you would have been comfortable with the othertwo mrs</s>  holland</s>  i dont know the colonels wife but mrs</s>  larkinshas travelled with us before and i had quite enough of her on thatvoyage</s> thank you very much captain</s>  it will indeed be a comfort to have acabin to myself</s> dick found that he was berthed with two young cadets whose names helearned from the cards fastened over the bunks were latham andfellows</s> half an hour after the arrival of the hollands on board thepassengers began to pour in rapidly and the deck of the madras wassoon crowded with them their friends and their luggage</s>  below allwas bustle and confusion</s>  men shouted angrily to stewards womenladen with parcels blocked the gangway and appealed helplessly toevery one for information and aid sailors carried down trunks andportmanteaus and mrs</s>  holland when she emerged from her cabinhaving stowed away her belongings and made things tidy congratulatedherself on having been the first on board and so had not only avoidedall this confusion but obtained a separate cabin which she might nototherwise have been able to do as the captain would have been toobusy to devote any special attention to her</s> after having handed her over to the care of the purser captainbarstow had spoken to the second officer who happened to be passing</s> mr</s>  rawlinson he said this is the son of my old friend captainholland</s>  he is going out with his mother</s>  i wish you would keep youreye upon him and let him join the midshipmen in their studies withyou in the morning</s>  possibly he may enter the service and it will bea great advantage to him to have got up navigation a bit before hedoes so</s>  at any rate it will occupy his mind and keep him out ofmischief</s>  a lad of his age would be like a fish out of water amongthe passengers on the quarterdeck</s> ay ay sir</s>  i will do what i can for him</s> and he hurried away</s> dick saw that for the present there was nothing to be done but tolook on and it was not until the next morning when the madras wasmaking her way south outside the goodwins that the second officerspoke to him</s> ah there you are lad</s>  i have been too busy to think of you and itwill be another day or two before we settle down to regular work</s> however i will introduce you to one or two of the midshipmen andthey will make you free of the ship</s> dick was indeed already beginning to feel at home</s>  the long tablefull from end to end had presented such a contrast to his quietdinner with his mother that as he sat down beside her and lookedround he thought he should never get to speak to anyone throughoutthe voyage</s>  however he had scarcely settled himself when a gentlemanin a naval uniform next to him made the remarkwell youngster what do you think of all this</s>  i suppose it is allnew to you</s> it is sir</s>  it seems very strange at first but i suppose i shallget accustomed to it</s> oh yes</s>  you will find it pleasant enough by and bye</s>  i am theships doctor</s>  the purser has been telling me about you and yourmother</s> i made one voyage with your father</s>  it was my first and a kindercaptain i never sailed with</s>  i heard from the purser that thereseems to be a chance of his being still alive and that your mother isgoing out to try and find out something about him</s>  i hope mostsincerely that she may succeed in doing so but he has been missing along time now</s>  still that is no reason why she should not find him</s> there have been instances where men have been kept for years by someof these rascally nativeswhy goodness only knows except isuppose because they fear and hate us and think that some time orother an english prisoner may be useful to them</s> your mother looks far from strong he went on as he glanced acrossdick to mrs</s>  holland who was talking to a lady on the other side ofher</s>  has she been ill</s> no sir</s>  i have never known her ill yet</s>  she has been worryingherself a great deal</s>  she has waited so long because she did not liketo go out until she could take me with her</s>  she has no friends inengland with whom she could leave me</s>  she looks a good deal betternow than she did a month ago</s>  i think directly she settled to comeout and had something to do she became better</s> that is quite natural the doctor said</s>  there is nothing so tryingas inactivity</s>  i have no doubt that the sea air will quite set her upagain</s>  it performs almost miracles on the homewardbound passengers</s> they come on board looking pale and listless and washed out at theend of a month at sea they are different creatures altogether</s> the purser had taken pains to seat mrs</s>  holland at table next to aperson who would be a pleasant companion for her and the lady she wasnow talking to was the wife of a chaplain in the army</s>  she had a yearbefore returned from india in the madras and he knew her to be akind and pleasant woman</s> dick did not care for his cabin mates</s>  they were young fellows ofabout eighteen years of age</s>  one was a nephew of a director of thecompany the other the son of a high indian official</s>  they paid butlittle attention to him generally ignoring him altogether andconversing about things and people in india in the tone of men towhom such matters were quite familiar</s> in three or four days dick became on good terms with the sixmidshipmen the madras carried</s>  two of them were younger than himselftwo somewhat older while the others were nearly out of their timeand hoped that this would be their last trip in the midshipmensberth</s>  the four younger lads studied two hours every morning underthe second officers instruction and dick took his place at the tableregularly with them</s> mathematics had been the only subject in which he had at alldistinguished himself at school and he found himself able to givesatisfaction to mr</s>  rawlinson in his studies of navigation</s>  afterthis work was over they had an hours practical instruction by theboatswains mate in knotting and splicing ropes and in other similarmatters</s> in a fortnight he had learned the names and uses of what had atfirst seemed to him the innumerable ropes and long before that hadaccompanied one of the midshipmen aloft</s>  on the first occasion that hedid so two of the topmen followed him with the intention of carryingout the usual custom of lashing him to the ratlines until he paid hisfooting</s>  seeing them coming up the midshipman laughed and told dickwhat was in store for him</s> the boy had been as awkward as most beginners in climbing the shroudsthe looseness and give of the ratlines puzzling him but he had foryears practised climbing ropes in the gymnasium at shadwell and wasconfident in his power to do anything in that way</s>  the consequence wasthat as soon as the sailors gained the top where he and themidshipman were standing dick seized one of the halliards and with amerry laugh came down hand over hand</s>  a minute later he stood on thedeck</s> well done youngster said the boatswains mate who happened to bestanding by as dicks feet touched the deck</s>  this may be the firsttime you have been on board a ship but it is easy to see that itisnt the first by a long way that you have been on a rope</s>  couldyou go up again</s> yes i should think so dick said</s>  i have never climbed so high asthat because i have never had the chance but it ought to be easyenough</s> the man laughed</s> there are not many sailors who can do it he said</s>  well let us seehow high you will get</s> as dick was accustomed to go up a rope thirty feet high hand overhand without using his legs he was confident that with theirassistance he could get up to the main top lofty as it was and heat once threw off his jacket and started</s>  he found the task harderthan he had anticipated but he did it without a pause</s>  he was gladhowever when the two sailors above grasped him by the arms andplaced him beside them on the main top</s> well sir one said admiringly we thought you was a johnnynewcome by the way you went up the ratlines but you came up thatrope like a monkey</s> well sir you are free up here and if you werent it would not makemuch odds to you for it would take half the ships company to captureyou</s> i dont want to get off paying my footing dick said pulling fiveshillings from his pocket and handing them to the sailors for hismother had told him that it was the custom on first going aloft tomake a present to them and had given him the money for the purpose</s> i can climb but i dont know anything about ropes and i shall bevery much obliged if you will teach me all you can</s> chapter 2 a brush with privateers</s> dick was surprised when on descending to the deck he found that whatseemed to him a by no means very difficult feat had attracted generalattention</s>  not only did half a dozen of the sailors pat him on theback with exclamations expressive of their surprise and admirationbut the other midshipmen spoke quite as warmly the eldest sayingi could have got up the rope holland but i could not have gone upstraight as you did without stopping for a bit to take breath</s>  youdont look so very strong either</s> i think that it is knack more than strength dick replied</s>  i havedone a lot of practice at climbing for i have always wanted to getstrong and i heard that there was no better exercise</s> when presently dick went aft to the quarterdeck captain barstowsaid to himyou have astonished us all lad</s>  i could hardly believe my eyes wheni saw you going up that rope</s>  i first caught sight of you when you hadclimbed but twenty feet and wondered how far you would get at thatpace</s>  i would have wagered a hundred guineas to one that you would nothave kept it up to the top</s> well lad whatever profession you take to it is certain that youwill be a good sailor spoilt</s> they had now been three weeks out but had made slow progress for thewinds had been light and mostly from the southwest</s> this is very dull work the doctor said to dick one day at dinner</s> here we are three weeks out and still hardly beyond the channel</s> there is one consolation</s>  it is not the fault of the ship</s>  she hasbeen doing well under the circumstances but the fates have beenagainst her thus far</s>  i have no doubt there are a score of shipsstill lying in the downs that were there when we passed and tediousas it has been beating down the channel with scarce wind enough mostof the time to keep our sails full it would have been worse lyingthere all the time</s> still we have gained a good bit on them sir</s> if the wind were to change round say to the northeast and theybrought it along with them they would soon make up for lost time forit would not take them three days to run here</s>  however we shall beginto do better soon</s>  i heard the captain say that he should change hiscourse tomorrow</s>  we are somewhere off cork and when he makes a fewmiles more westing he will bear away south</s>  if we had had afavourable wind we should have taken our departure from the startbut with it in this quarter we are obliged to make more westingbefore we lay her head on her course or we should risk getting in tooclose to the french coast and their privateers are as thick as peasthere</s> but we should not be afraid of a french privateer doctor</s> well not altogether afraid of one but they very often go incouples and sometimes three of them will work together</s>  i dont thinkone privateer alone would venture to attack us though she mightharass us a bit and keep up a distant fire in hopes that anothermight hear it and bear down to her aid</s>  but it is always as well tokeep free of them if one can</s>  you see an unlucky shot might knockone of our sticks out of us which would mean delay and trouble if noworse</s> we had a sharp brush with two of them on the last voyage but webeat them off</s>  we were stronger then than we are now for we had twohundred troops on board and should have astonished them if they hadcome close enough to try boardingin fact we were slackening ourfire to tempt them to do so when they made out that a large craftcoming up astern was an english frigate and sheered off</s> i dont know what the end of it was but i rather fancy they weretaken</s>  the frigate followed them gaining fast and later on wecould hear guns in the distance</s> you did not join in the chase then doctor</s> oh no</s>  our business is not fighting</s>  if we are attacked of coursewe defend ourselves but we dont go a foot out of our way if we canhelp it</s> three weeks at sea had done wonders for mrs</s>  holland</s>  now that she wasfairly embarked upon her quest the expression of anxiety graduallydied out</s>  the sea air braced up her nerves and what was of stillgreater benefit to her she was able to sleep soundly and dreamlesslya thing she had not done for years</s>  dick was delighted at the changein her</s> you look quite a different woman mother he said</s>  i dont thinkyour friends at shadwell would know you if they were to see you now</s> i feel a different woman dick</s>  i have not felt so well and so brightsince your father sailed on his last voyage</s>  i am more convinced thanever that we shall succeed</s>  i have been trying very hard for yearsto be hopeful but now i feel so without trying</s>  of course it ispartly this lovely weather and the sea air and sleeping so well andpartly because everyone is so kind and pleasant</s> as soon as the madras had been headed for the south she began to makebetter way</s>  the wind freshened somewhat but continued in the samequarter</s>  grumbling ceased over the bad luck they were having andhopeful anticipations that after all they would make a quick passagewere freely indulged in</s> on the fourth day after changing her course she was off the coast ofspain which was but a hundred and fifty miles distant</s>  at noon thatday the wind dropped suddenly and an hour later it was a dead calm</s> we are going to have a change dick the doctor said as he stoppedby the lad who was leaning against the bulwark watching a flock ofseabirds that were following a shoal of fish dashing down among themwith loud cries and too intent upon their work to notice the shiplying motionless a hundred yards away</s> what sort of a change doctor</s> most likely a strong blow though from what quarter it is too soon tosay</s>  however we have no reason to grumble</s>  after nearly a month oflight winds we must expect a turn of bad weather</s>  i hope it will comefrom the north</s>  that will take us down to the latitude of madeira andbeyond that we may calculate upon another spell of fine weather untilwe cross the line</s> as the afternoon wore on the weather became more dull</s>  there were noclouds in the sky but the deep blue was dimmed by a sort of haze</s> presently after a talk between the captain and the first officer thelatter gave the order all hands take in sail</s> the order had been expected and the men at once swarmed up therigging</s>  in a quarter of an hour all the upper sails were furled</s>  thelight spars were then sent down to the deck</s> you may as well get the topgallant sails off her too mr</s>  greenthe captain said to the first officer</s>  it is as well to be preparedfor the worst</s>  it is sure to blow pretty hard when the change comes</s> the topgallant sails were got in and when the courses had beenbrailed up and secured the hands were called down</s>  presently thecaptain after going to his cabin rejoined mr</s>  green</s> the glass has gone up again dick heard him say</s> that looks as if it were coming from the north sir</s> yes with some east in it</s>  it could not come from a better quarter</s> he turned and gazed steadily in that direction</s> yes there is dark water over there</s> so there is sir</s>  that is all right</s>  i dont mind how hard it blowsso that it does but come on gradually</s> i agree with you</s>  these hurricane bursts when one is becalmed arealways dangerous even when one is under bare poles</s> gradually the dark line on the horizon crept up towards the ship</s>  asit reached her the sails bellied out and she began to move throughthe water</s>  the wind increased in strength rapidly and in half an hourshe was running south at ten or eleven knots an hour</s>  the thermometerhad fallen many degrees and as the sun set the passengers were gladto go below for shelter</s> before going to bed dick went up on deck for a few minutes</s>  thetopsails had been reefed down but the madras was rushing through thewater at a high rate of speed</s>  the sea was getting up and the waveswere crested with foam</s>  above the stars were shining brilliantly</s> well lad this is a change is it not</s>  the captain said as he camealong in a pea jacket</s> we seem to be going splendidly captain</s> yes we are walking along grandly and making up for lost time</s> it is blowing hard sir</s> it will blow a good deal harder before morning lad but i do notthink it will be anything very severe</s>  things wont be so comfortabledownstairs for the next day or two but that is likely to be theworst of it</s> the motion of the ship kept dick awake for some time but wedginghimself tightly in his berth he presently fell off to sleep and didnot wake again until morning</s>  his two cabin mates were sufferingterribly from seasickness but he felt perfectly well although ittook him a long time to dress so great was the motion of the ship</s> on making his way on deck he found that overhead the sky was blue andbright and the sun shining brilliantly</s>  the wind was blowing muchharder than on the previous evening and a heavy sea was running butas the sun sparkled on the white crests of the waves the scene wasfar less awe inspiring than it had been when he looked out beforeretiring to his berth</s>  the ship under closelyreefed main andforetop sails was tearing through the water at a high rate of speedthrowing clouds of spray from her bows and occasionally taking a waveover them that sent a deluge of water along the deck</s> what do you think of this lad</s>  mr</s>  rawlinson who was in charge ofthe watch asked him as after watching his opportunity he made arush to the side and caught a firm hold of a shroud</s> it is splendid sir he said</s>  has she been going like this allnight</s> the officer nodded</s> how long do you think it will last sir</s> two or three days</s> will it be any worse sir</s> not likely to be</s>  it is taking us along rarely and it is doing usgood in more ways than one</s> look there and as they rose on a wave he pointed across the waterbehind dick</s> the lad turned and saw a brig running parallel to their course halfa mile distant</s> what of her sir</s> that is a french privateer unless i am greatly mistaken</s> but she has the british ensign flying sir</s> ay but that goes for nothing</s>  she may possibly be a trader on herway down to the guinea coast but by the cut of her sails and the lookof her hull i have no doubt that she is a frenchman</s> we are passing her sir</s> oh yes</s>  in a gale and a heavy sea weight tells and we shall soonleave her astern but in fine weather i expect she could sail roundand round us</s>  if the french could fight their ships as well as theycan build them we should not be in it with them</s> why dont we fire at her mr</s>  rawlinson</s> the officer laughed</s> how are you going to work your guns with the ship rolling like this</s> no lad we are like two muzzled dogs at presentwe can do nothingbut watch each other</s>  i am sorry to say that i dont think the fellowis alone</s>  two or three times i have fancied that i caught a glimpse ofa sail on our starboard quarter</s>  i could not swear to it but i dontthink i was mistaken and i called the captains attention that wayjust before he went down ten minutes ago and he thought he saw ittoo</s>  however as there was nothing to be done he went down for acaulk</s>  he had not left the deck since noon yesterday</s> but if she is no bigger than the other i suppose we shall leave herbehind too mr</s>  rawlinson</s> ay lad we shall leave them both behind presently but if they arewhat i think we are likely to hear more of them later on</s>  they wouldnot be so far offshore as this unless they were on the lookout forindiamen which of course keep much farther out than ships bound upthe mediterranean and having once spotted us they will follow uslike hounds on a deers trail</s>  however i think they are likely tofind that they have caught a tartar when they come up to us</s> ah</s>  here is the doctor</s> well doctor what is the report below</s> only the usual number of casualtiesa sprained wrist a fewcontusions and three or four cases of hysterics</s> is mother all right doctor</s>  dick asked</s> as i have heard nothing of her i have no doubt she is</s>  i am quitesure that she will not trouble me with hysterics</s>  women who have hadreal trouble to bear dick can be trusted to keep their nerves steadyin a gale</s> i suppose you call this a gale doctor</s> certainly</s>  it is a stiff northeasterly gale and if we were facingit instead of running before it you would not want to ask thequestion</s> that is a suspiciouslooking craft rawlinson he broke offcatching sight of the brig now on their port quarter</s> yes she is a privateer i have no doubt and unless i am mistakenshe has a consort somewhere out there to starboard</s>  however we neednot trouble about them</s>  travelling as we are we are going two knotsan hour faster than the brig</s> so much the better the doctor said shortly</s>  we can laugh at oneof these fellows but when it comes to two of them i own that i dontcare for their company</s>  so the longer this gale holds on the better</s> the mate nodded</s> well dick the doctor went on do you feel as if you will be ableto eat your breakfast</s> i shall be ready enough for it doctor but i dont see how it willbe possible to eat it with the vessel rolling like this</s> you certainly will not be able to sit down to itnothing would stayon the table a minute</s>  there will be no regular breakfast today</s>  youmust get the steward to cut you a chunk of cold meat put it betweentwo slices of bread and make a sandwich of it</s>  as to tea ask him togive you a bottle and to pour your tea into that then if you wedgeyourself into a corner you will find that you are able to manage yourbreakfast comfortably and can amuse yourself watching people tryingto balance a cup of tea in their hand</s> not more than half a dozen passengers ventured on deck for the nexttwo days but at the end of that time the force of the wind graduallyabated and on the following morning the madras had all her sails setto a light but still favourable breeze</s>  madeira had been passed todicks disappointment but except for a fresh supply of vegetablesthere was no occasion to put in there and the captain grudged theloss of a day while so favourable a wind was taking them along</s> do you think we shall see anything of that brig again doctor</s>  dickasked as for the first time since the wind sprang up the passengerssat down to a comfortable breakfast</s> there is no saying dick</s>  if we gained two knots an hour during theblow and i dont suppose we gained more than one and a half theymust be a hundred and twenty miles or so astern of us after all thatis only half a days run</s>  i think they are pretty sure to follow usfor a bit for they will know that in light winds they travel fasterthan we do and if we get becalmed while they still hold the breezethey will come up hand over hand</s>  it is likely enough that in anotherthree days or so we may get a sight of them behind us</s> this was evidently the captains opinion also for during the day theguns were overhauled and their carriages examined and the musketsbrought up on deck and cleaned</s>  on the following day the men werepractised at the guns and then had pike and cutlass exercise</s> none of the passengers particularly noticed these proceedings fordick had been warned by the captain to say nothing about the brig andas he was the only passenger on deck at the time no whisper of theprivateers had come to the ears of the others</s> the party were just going down to lunch on the third day when alookout in the maintop hailed the decka sail astern</s> how does she bear</s> she is dead astern of us sir and i can only make out her uppersails</s>  i should say that they are her royals</s> mr</s>  green ran up with his telescope slung over his shoulder</s> i cannot make much out of her sir he shouted to the captain</s>  shemay be anything</s>  she must be nearly thirty miles astern</s>  i think withpearson that it is her royals we see</s> take a look round mr</s>  green</s> the mate did so and presently called downi can make out something else away on the starboard quarter but sofar astern that i can scarce swear to her</s>  still it can be nothingbut a sail</s> thank you mr</s>  green</s>  i daresay that we shall know more about herlater on</s> when the captain joined the passengers at table one of the ladiessaidyou seem interested in that ship astern of us captain</s> yes mrs</s>  seaforth</s>  one is always interested in a ship when one getsdown as far as this</s>  she may be another indiaman and although themadras has no claim to any great speed in a light breeze like thisone never likes being passed</s> the explanation was considered as sufficient and nothing more wassaid on the subject</s>  by sunset the upper sails of the stranger couldbe made out from the deck of the madras</s>  mr</s>  green again went up andhad a look at her</s> she is coming up fast he said when he rejoined the captain</s>  shekeeps so dead in our wake that i cant make out whether she is a brigor a three master but i fancy that she is a brig by the size and cutof her sails</s>  i can see the other craft plainly enough now she iseight or ten miles west of the other and has closed in towards hersince i made her out before</s>  i have no doubt that she is a largeschooner</s> well it is a comfort that they are not a few miles nearer mr</s> green</s>  there is no chance of their overtaking us before morning so weshall be able to keep our watches as usual and shall have time to getready for a fight if there is to be one</s> the sooner the better sir so that it is daylight</s>  it is quitecertain that they have the legs of us</s> in the morning when dick came up he found that the wind had quitedied away and the sails hung loosely from the yards</s>  looking asternhe saw two vessels</s>  they were some six miles away and perhaps twomiles apart</s>  as they lay without steerage way they had swung partlyround and he saw that they were a brig and a schooner</s>  the former hehad no doubt from her lofty masts and general appearance was thesame the madras had passed six days before</s>  as the passengers came upthey were full of curiosity as to the vessels</s> of course we know no more actually than you do yourselves thecaptain said as some of them gathered round and questioned him buti may as well tell you frankly that we have very little doubt abouttheir being two french privateers</s>  we passed them during the gale andhad some hopes that we should not see them again but in the lightbreeze we have been having during the last few days they have made uplost ground and i am afraid we shall have to fight them</s> exclamations of alarm broke from some of the ladies who heard hiswords</s> you need not be alarmed ladies he went on</s>  we carry twelve gunsyou know and i expect that all of them are of heavier metal thantheirs</s>  the madras is a stronglybuilt ship and will stand a gooddeal more hammering than those light craft will so that i have nodoubt we shall give a good account of ourselves</s> after breakfast the hatches were opened and the gun cases belongingto the passengers brought on deck</s>  scarce one of them but had a rifleand many had in addition a shotgun</s>  the day passed without anychange in the positions of the vessels for they still lay becalmed</s> why dont they get out their boats and tow their vessels up</s>  dickasked the doctor</s> because they would be throwing away their chances if they did so</s> they know that we cannot get away from them and we might smash uptheir boats as soon as they came within range</s>  besides their speedand superior handiness give them a pull over us when fighting undersail</s>  they may try to tow up during the night if they think they arestrong enough to take us by boarding but i hardly think they will doso</s> the night however passed off quietly</s>  but in the morning a lightbreeze sprang up from the east the sails were trimmed and the madrasagain began to move through the water</s>  by breakfast time the craftbehind had visibly decreased their distance</s> the meal was a silent one</s>  when it was over the captain saidas soon as those fellows open fire ladies i must ask you all to godown into the hold</s>  the sailors have already cleared a space belowthe waterline large enough for you and they will take down somecushions and so on to make you as comfortable as possible under thecircumstances</s>  pray do not be alarmed at any noises you may hear</s>  youwill be below the waterline and perfectly safe from their shot andyou may be sure that we shall do our best to keep the scoundrels fromboarding us and i will let you know from time to time how mattersare going</s> the unmarried men at once went up on deck</s>  the others lingered for ashort time behind talking to their wives and daughters and thenfollowed</s> the wind has strengthened a bit mr</s>  green the captain said and ifancy we shall get more</s> i think so too captain</s> then you may as well get off the upper sails and make her snug</s>  getoff everything above the top gallant</s>  then if the wind increases weshall not want to call the men away from the guns</s> the crew had without orders already mustered at quarters</s>  thelashings had been cast off the guns the boatswain had opened themagazines and a pile of shot stood by each gun together with casesof canister and grapeshot for close work</s>  boarding pikes and cutlasseswere ranged along by the bulwarks</s>  the men had thrown aside theirjackets and many of those at the guns were stripped to the waist</s> some of them were laughing and talking and dick saw by their air ofconfidence that they had no doubt of their ability to beat off theassault of the privateers</s> the latter were the first to open the ball</s>  a puff of smoke burst outfrom the brigs bows followed almost instantly by one from theschooner</s>  both shots fell short and for a quarter of an hour thethree vessels kept on their way</s> we have heavier metal than that the captain said cheerfully andi have no doubt we could reach them</s>  but it is not our game to play atlong bowls for it is probable that both of them carry a long pivotgun and if they were to draw off a bit they could annoy usamazingly while we could not reach them</s>
presently the privateers opened fire again</s>  they were now about a mileaway and the same distance from each other</s>  their shot fell close tothe indiaman and two or three passed through her sails</s> still no reply was made</s>  the men at the guns fidgeted and keptcasting glances towards the poop in expectation of an order</s>  it cameat last but was not what they had expected</s> double shot your guns men the captain said</s> scarcely was the order obeyed when the brig which was now on the portquarter luffed up a little into the wind and fired a broadside ofeight guns</s>  there was a crashing of wood</s>  the madras was hulled inthree places two more holes appeared in her sails while the othershot passed harmlessly just astern of her</s> there was an angry growl among the sailors as the schooner bore awaya little and also fired her broadside</s>  except that a man was struckdown by a splinter from the bulwarks no damage was done</s> bear up a little the captain said to the second officer who wasstanding by the helmsman</s>  i want to edge in a little towards thebrig but not enough for them to notice it</s> now gentlemen he went on to the passengers i have no doubt thatmost of you are good shots and i want you after we have fired ourbroadside to direct your attention to the brigs helmsmen</s>  if you canrender it impossible for the men to stand at the wheel we will makemincemeat of this fellow in no time</s>  directly i have fired our portbroadside i am going to bring her up into the wind on the oppositetack and give him the starboard broadside at close quarters</s>  dontfire until we have gone about and then pick off the helmsmen if youcan</s> get ready men</s> the brig was now but a little more than a quarter of a mile distant</s> aim at the foot of his mainmast he went on</s>  let each man fire ashe gets the mast on his sight</s> a moment later the first gun fired and the whole broadside followedin quick succession</s> down with the helm</s>  hard down sheets and tacks</s> the men whose duty it was to trim the sails ran to the sheets andbraces</s>  the madras swept up into the wind and as her sails drew onthe other tack she came along on a course that would take her withina hundred yards of the brig</s> as she approached three rifles cracked out on her poop</s>  one of themen at the helm of the brig fell and as he did so half a dozen moreshots were fired and as his companion dropped beside him the brigdeprived of her helm flew up into the wind</s> three men ran aft to the wheel but the deadly rifles spoke out again</s> two of them fell</s>  the third dived under the bulwark for shelter</s> steady men</s>  the captain shouted</s>  fetch her mainmast out of her</s> as they swept along under the stern of the brig each gun

over the sidedragging with it the foretopmast with all its gear</s> down with the helm again</s>  the captain shouted</s>  bring her head towind and keep her there</s> the first officer sprang forward to see that the order was carriedinto effect and a minute later the indiaman lay with her sailsaback at a distance of a hundred yards on the quarter of the brig</s> grape and canister</s>  the captain shouted and broadside afterbroadside swept the decks of the brig which hampered by herwreckage was lying almost motionless in the water</s>  so terrible wasthe fire that the privateers men threw down

sheets and braces mr</s>  green and get her on her courseagainthe schooner wont trouble us now</s> that craft had indeed at first luffed up to come to the assistanceof her consort but on seeing the fall of the latters mast and thatshe was incapable of rendering any assistance had again altered hercourse feeling her incapacity to engage so redoubtable an opponentsingle handed</s>  three hearty cheers broke from all on board the madrasas after pouring in a broadside at a distance of fifty yards sheleft the brig behind her and proceeded on her way</s> then you dont care about taking prizes captain</s>  one of thepassengers said as they crowded round to congratulate him upon hiseasy and almost bloodless victory</s> no taking prizes is not my business and were i to weaken my crewby

are lowering a boat one of the passengers said</s> so they are</s>  i expect they havent got more than one that can swim</s> i think she is settling down the captain said as he lookedearnestly at the wreck astern</s>  see how they are crowding into thatboat and how some of the others are cutting and slashing to get thewreckage clear of her</s> she is certainly a good bit lower in the water than she was thefirst officer agreed</s>  the schooner has come round and wont be longbefore she is alongside of her</s> there was no doubt that the brig was settling down fast</s>  men stood onthe bulwarks and waved their caps frantically to the schooner</s>  otherscould be seen by the aid of a glass casting spars hen coops andother articles overboard and jumping into the water after them

moment later the hull had disappeared and the schooner remainedalone</s> by this time the whole of the ladies had ascended from their place ofsafety to the poop and a general exclamation broke from

somewhat depressed</s>  nowthat the voyage was nearly over the difficulties of the task beforeher seemed greater than they had done when viewed from a distance andshe asked herself whether after all

shall tomorrow send out a messenger totripataly to tell my brother of our arrival here</s> how far is it mother</s> it is about a hundred and twenty miles in a straight line i thinkbut a good bit farther than that by the way we shall go</s> how shall we travel mother</s> i will make some inquiries tomorrow but i think that the pleasantestway will be to drive from here to conjeveram</s>  i think that is aboutforty miles</s>  there we can take a native boat and go up the riverpalar past arcot and vellore to vaniambaddy</s>  from there it is onlyabout fifteen miles to tripataly</s> i shall tell my brother the way i propose going</s>  of course if hethinks any other way will be better we shall go by that</s> are we going to travel as we are mother or in native dress</s> that is a point that i have been thinking over dick</s>  i will waitand ask my brother which he thinks will be the best</s>  when out there ialways dressed as a native and never put on english clothes exceptat madras</s>  i used to come down here two or three times every yearwith my mother and generally stayed for a fortnight or three weeks</s> during that time we always dressed in english fashion as by so doingwe could live at the hotel and take our meals at public tableswithout exciting comment</s>  my mother knew several families here andliked getting back to english ways occasionally</s> of course i shall dress in indian fashion while i stay at mybrothers so it is only the question of how we shall journey thereand i think i should prefer going as we are</s>  we shall excite nospecial observation travelling as english as it will only besupposed that we are on our way to pay a visit to some of ourofficers at arcot</s>  at conjeveram which is a large place there issure to be a hotel of some sort or other for it is on the main roadfrom madras south</s>  on the way up by water we shall of course sleepon board and we shall go direct from the boat to tripataly</s> however we need not decide until we get an answer to my letter forit will take a very short time to get the necessary dresses for usboth</s>  i think it most likely that my brother will send down one of hisofficers to meet us or possibly may come down himself</s> you heard what they were all talking about at dinner dick</s> yes mother it was something about tippoo attacking the rajah oftravancore but i did not pay much attention to it</s>  i was looking atthe servants in their curious dresses</s> it is very important dick and will probably change all our plans</s> travancore is in alliance with us and every one thinks that tippoosattack on it will end in our being engaged in war with him</s>  i wastalking to the officer who sat next to me and he told me that ifthere had been a capable man at the head of government here war wouldhave been declared as soon as the sultan moved against travancore</s>  nowthat general meadows had been appointed governor and commanderinchiefthere was no doubt he said that an army would move against tippoo in avery short timethat it was already being collected and that a forcewas marching down here from bengal</s> so you see my boy if this war really breaks out the english maymarch to seringapatam and compel tippoo to give up all the captiveshe has in his hands</s> that would be splendid mother</s> at any rate dick as long as there is a hope of your father beingrescued in that way our plans must be put aside</s> well mother that will be better in some respects for of courseif father is not rescued by our army i can try afterwards as wearranged</s>  it would be an advantage in one way as i should then bequite accustomed to the country and more fit to make my way about</s> a week later an old officer arrived from tripataly</s> ah rajbullub mrs</s>  holland exclaimed as he came up with a deepsalaam i am indeed glad to see you again</s>  i knew you were alivefor my brother mentioned you when he wrote last year</s> rajbullub was evidently greatly pleased at the recognition</s> i think i should have known you lady he said but eighteen yearsmakes more changes in the young than in the old</s>  truly i am glad tosee you again</s>  there was great joy among us who knew you as a childwhen the rajah told us that you were here</s>  he has sent me on to saythat he will arrive tomorrow</s>  i am to see to his apartments and tohave all in readiness</s>  he intends to stay here some days beforereturning to tripataly</s> will he come to this hotel</s> no lady he will take the house he always has when he is here</s>  itis kept for the use of our princes when they come down to madras</s>  hebade me say that he hopes you will remain here for that none of therooms could be got ready at such a short notice</s> he has not written for he hates writing which is a thing that hehas small occasion for</s>  i was to tell you that his heart rejoiced atthe thought of seeing you again and that his love for you is as warmas it was when you were a boy and girl together</s> this is my son rajbullub</s>  he has often heard me speak of you</s> yes indeed dick said warmly</s>  i heard how you saved her frombeing bitten by a cobra when she was a little girl</s> ah</s>  the young lord speaks our tongue rajbullub said with greatpleasure</s>  we wondered whether you would have taught it to him</s>  if ithad not been that you always wrote to my lord in our language weshould have thought that you yourself would surely have forgottenit after dwelling so long among the white sahibs</s> no we always speak it when together rajbullub</s>  i thought that hemight some day come out here and that he would find it very usefuland i too have been looking forward to returning for a time to thehome where i was born</s> there were many questions to ask about her brother his wife and twosons</s>  they were younger than dick for mrs</s>  holland was three yearssenior to the rajah</s> at last she said i will not detain you longer rajbullub</s>  i knowthat you will have a great deal to do to get ready for my brotherscoming</s>  at what time will he arrive</s> he hopes to be here by ten in the morning before the heat of the daysets in</s> i shall of course be there to meet him</s> so he hoped lady</s>  he said that he would have come straight herefirst but he thought it would be more pleasant for you to meet him inprivacy</s> assuredly it would she agreed</s> i will bring a carriage for you here at nine oclock and take youand my young lord to the rajahs house</s> at the appointed time a handsome carriage and pair drove up to thedoor of the hotel and in ten minutes mrs</s>  holland and dick alightedin the courtyard of a large house</s>  four native servants were at thedoor and the old officer led the way to a spacious room</s>  this wascarpeted with handsome rugs</s>  soft cushions were piled on the divanrunning round the room the divan itself being covered with velvet andsilk rugs</s>  looking glasses were ranged upon the walls a handsomechandelier hung from the roof draperies of gauze lightly embroideredwith gold hung across the windows</s> why rajbullub you have done wondersthat is if the house wasunfurnished yesterday</s> it is simple the hindoo said</s>  my lord your brother like otherrajahs who use the house when they come down here has a roomupstairs in which are kept locked up everything required forfurnishing the rooms he uses</s>  four of his servants came down herewith me</s>  we had but to call in sweepers to clear the house from dustand wash down the marble floors and then everything was put into itsplace</s>  the cook who also came down has hired assistants and allwill be ready for my lord when he arrives</s> in half an hour one of the servants ran in and announced that therajah was in the courtyard</s>  there was a great trampling of hoofs anda minute later he ascended the stairs and was met by his sister anddick at the door of the room</s> mrs</s>  holland had attired herself handsomely not so much for the sakeof her brother but that as his sister those with him would expectto see in her an english lady of position and dick thought that hehad never seen her looking so well as when in a dress of richbrocade and with a flush of pleasure and expectation on her cheeksshe advanced to the door</s>  she was still but a little over thirtythreeyears old and although the long years of anxiety and sorrow had lefttheir traces on her face the rest and quiet of the sea voyage haddone much to restore the fulness of her cheeks and to soften theoutline of her figure</s> the rajah a young and handsomelooking man of thirty ascended thestairs with an eagerness and speed that were somewhat at variance withdicks preconceived ideas of the stateliness of an eastern prince</s> my sister margaret</s>  he exclaimed in english and embraced her witha warmth that showed that his affection for her was unimpaired by theyears that had passed since he last saw her</s> then he stood with his hands on her shoulders looking earnestly ather</s> i know you again he said</s>  you are changed but i can recall yourface well</s>  you are welcome margaret most welcome</s> and this is my nephew</s>  he went on turning to dick and holding outboth his hands to him</s>  you are taller than i expectedwell nigh astall as i am</s>  you are like your mother and my mother and you are boldand active and strong she writes me</s>  my boys are longing to see youand you will be most welcome at tripataly</s> i have almost forgotten my english margaret and indeed he spokewith some difficulty evidently choosing his wordsi should quitehave forgotten it had not i often had occasion to speak it withenglish officers</s>  i see by your letters that you have not forgottenour tongue</s> not in the least mortiz</s>  i have for years spoken nothing else withdick and he speaks it as well as i do</s> that is good the rajah replied in his own tongue and in a tone ofrelief</s>  i was wondering how he would get on with us</s> now let us sit down</s>  we have so much to tell each other andmoreover i am ravenous for breakfast as i have ridden forty milessince sunrise</s> breakfast was speedily served the rajah eating in english fashion</s> i cling to some of our mothers ways you see margaret</s>  as i havegrown older i have become more english than i was</s>  naturally as aboy of thirteen as i was when you last saw me i listened to the talkof those around me and was guided by their opinions a good deal</s> among them there was a feeling of regret that our father had marriedan english woman and i of course was ever trying my hardest to showthat in riding or the chase or in exercises of any kind i was asworthy to be the son of an indian rajah as if i had no white blood inmy veins</s> as i grew up i became wiser</s>  i saw how great the english were howsteadily they extended their dominions and how vastly better off wereour people under their sway than they were in the days when everyrajah made war against his neighbour and the land never had rest</s> then i grew proud of my english blood and although i am to mypeople rajah of tripataly a native prince and lord of theirdestinies keeping up the same state as my father and ruling them innative fashion in my inner house i have adopted many english ways</s> my wife has no rival in the zenana</s>  i encourage her to go about asour mother did to look after the affairs of the house to sit attable with me and to be my companion and not a mere plaything</s>  i amsure margaret your stay with us will do her much good and she willlearn a great deal from you</s> you have heard no news since you last wrote mortiz</s> a slight cloud passed across the rajahs animated face</s> none margaret</s>  we have little news from beyond the mountains</s>  tippoohates us who are the friends of the english as much as he hates theenglish themselves so there is little communication between mysoreand the possessions of the nabob of arcot</s>  we will talk later on ofthe plans you wrote of in your last letter to me</s> you do not think that they are hopeless mortiz</s>  mrs</s>  holland askedanxiously</s> i would not say that they are hopeless he said gently although itseems to me that after all these years the chances are slightindeed that your husband can be alive and the peril and danger ofthe enterprise that so far as i understood you you intend your sonto undertake would be terrible indeed</s> we see that mortiz</s>  dick and i have talked it over a thousandtimes</s>  but so long as there is but a shadow of a chance of his findinghis father he is ready to undertake the search</s>  he is a boy in yearsbut he has been trained for the undertaking and will when the trialcomes bear himself as well as a man</s> well margaret i shall have plenty of opportunities for forming myown judgment because of course he will stay with us a long timebefore he starts on the quest and it will be better to say no more ofthis now</s> now tell me about london</s>  is it so much a greater city than madras</s> mrs</s>  holland sighed</s>  she saw by his manner that he was whollyopposed to her plan and although she was quite prepared foropposition she could not help feeling disappointed</s>  however sheperceived that as he said it would be better to drop the subject fora time and she accordingly put it aside and answered his questions</s> madras is largethat is it spreads over a wide extent but if itwere packed with houses as closely as they could stand it would notapproach london in the number of its population</s> how is it that the english do not send more troops out heremargaret</s> because they can raise troops here and english soldiers cannot standthe heat as well as those born to it</s>  moreover you must rememberthat at present england is at war not only with france and halfeurope but also with america</s>  she is also obliged to keep an army inireland which is greatly disaffected</s>  with all this on her hands shecannot send a large army so far across the seas especially when herforce here is sufficient for all that can be required of it</s> that is true he said</s>  it is wonderful what they have done outhere with such small forces</s>  but they will have harder work beforethey conquer all indiaas i believe they will dothan they have yetencountered</s>  in spite of tippoos vauntings they will have mysorebefore many years are over</s>  the sultan seems to have forgotten thelesson they taught him six or seven years back</s>  but the next timewill be the last and tippoo tiger as he is will meet the fate heseems bent on provoking</s> but beyond mysore lies the mahratta country and the mahrattis alonecan put thirty thousand horsemen into the field</s>  they are not like thepeople of bengal who have ever fallen with scarce an attempt atresistance under the yoke of one tyrant after another</s>  the mahrattisare a nation of warriors</s>  they are plunderers if you will but theyare brave and fearless soldiers and might had they been united havehad all india under their feet before the coming of the english</s>  thatchance has slipped from them</s>  but when wei say we you seemargaretmeet them it will be a desperate struggle indeed</s> we shall thrash them uncle dick broke in</s>  you will see that weshall beat them thoroughly</s> the rajah smiled at dicks impetuosity</s> so you think english soldiers cannot be beaten eh</s> well uncle somehow they never do get beaten</s>  i dont know how itis</s>  i suppose that it is just obstinacy</s>  look how we thrashed thefrench here and they were just as well drilled as our soldiers andthere were twice as many of them</s> the rajah nodded</s> one secret of our success dick is that the english get on betterwith the natives here than the french doi dont know why exceptwhat i have heard from people who went through the war</s>  they say thatthe french always seemed to look down on the natives and treated evenpowerful allies with a sort of haughtiness that irritated them andmade them ready to change sides at the first opportunity while thebritish treated them pleasantly so that there was a real friendshipbetween them</s> dick finding that the conversation now turned to the time when hismother and uncle were girl and boy together left them and wentdownstairs</s>  he found some twenty horses ranged in the courtyard whiletheir riders were sitting in the shade several of them being engagedin cooking</s>  these were the escort who had ridden with the rajah fromtripatalyfor no indian prince would think of making a journeyunless accompanied by a numerous retinue</s> scarcely had he entered the yard than rajbullub came up with theofficer in command of the escort a finelooking specimen of a hindoosoldier</s>  he salaamed as rajbullub presented him to dick</s>  the ladaddressed him at once in his own tongue and they were soon talkingfreely together</s>  the officer was surprised at finding that his lordsnephew from beyond the sea was able to speak the language like anative</s> first dick asked the nature of the country and the places at whichthey would halt on their way</s>  then he inquired what force the rajahcould put into the field and was somewhat disappointed to hear thathe kept up but a hundred horsemen including those who served as anescort</s> you see sahib there is no occasion for soldiers</s>  now that thewhites are the masters they do the fighting for us</s>  when the rajahsfather was a young man he could put two thousand men under arms andhe joined at the siege of trichinopoly with twelve hundred</s>  but nowthere is no longer need for an army</s>  there is no one to fight</s>  some ofthe young men grumble but the old ones rejoice at the change</s> formerly they had to go to the plough with their spears and theirswords beside them because they never knew when marauders from thehills might sweep down besides when there was war they might becalled away for weeks while the crops were wasting upon the ground</s> as to the younger men who grumble i say to them if you are tiredof a peaceful life go and enlist in a companys regiment and everyyear some of them do so</s> in other ways the change is good</s>  now that the rajah has no longerto keep up an army he is not obliged to squeeze the cultivators</s> therefore they pay but a light rent for their lands and the rajah isfar better off than his father was so that on all sides there iscontent and prosperity</s>  but even now the fear of mysore has notquite died out</s> my position margaret the rajah said after dick had left the roomis a very precarious one</s>  when hyder ali marched down here eightyears ago he swept the whole country from the foot of the hills tothe sea coast</s>  my father would have been glad to stand neutral butwas of course bound to go with the english as the nabob of arcothis nominal sovereign went with them</s>  his sympathies were of coursewith your people but most of the chiefs were at heart in favour ofhyder</s>  it was not that they loved him or preferred the rule of mysoreto that of madras</s>  but at that time madras was governed by imbeciles</s> its council was composed entirely of timid and irresolute men</s>  it wasclear to all that before any force capable of withstanding him couldbe put in the field the whole country beyond reach of the guns ofthe forts at madras would be at the mercy of hyder</s> what that mercy was had been shown elsewhere</s>  whole populations hadbeen either massacred or carried off as slaves</s>  therefore when thestorm was clearly about to burst almost all of them sent secretmessages to hyder to assure him that their sympathies were with himand that they would gladly hail him as ruler of the carnatic</s> my father was in no way inclined to take such a step</s>  his marriagewith an english woman the white blood in my veins and his longknownpartiality for the english would have marked him for certaindestruction and as soon as he received news that hyders troops werein movement he rode with me to madras</s>  at that time his force wascomparatively large and he took three hundred men down with us</s>  hehad allowed all who preferred it to remain behind and some fourhundred stayed to look after their families</s>  most of the populationtook to the hills and as hyders forces were too much occupied tospend time in scouring the ghauts in search of fugitives when therewas so much loot and so many captives ready to their hands on theplains the fugitives for the most part remained there in safety</s>  thepalace was burnt the town sacked and partly destroyed and somefifteen hundred of our people who had remained in their homes killedor carried off</s> my father did some service with our horse and i fought by his side</s> we were with colonel baillies force when it was destroyed after fortwo days resisting the whole of hyder alls army</s>  being mounted weescaped and reached madras in safety after losing half our number</s> but all that i can tell you about some other day</s> when peace was made and hyder retired we returned home rebuilt thepalace and restored the town</s>  but if tippoo follows his fathersexample and sweeps down from the hills there will be nothing for itbut to fly again</s>  tippoo commanded one of the divisions of hydersarmy last time and showed much skill and energy and has since hecame to the throne been a scourge to his neighbours in the north</s>  sofar as i can see madras will be found as unprepared as it was lasttime and although the chiefs of vellore arcot conjeveram and otherplaces may be better disposed towards the english than they werebeforefor the carnatic had a terrible lesson last timethey willnot dare to lift a finger against him until they see a large britishforce assembled</s> so you see sister your position will be a very precarious one attripataly and it is likely that at any time we may be obliged toseek refuge here</s>  the trouble may come soon or it may not come for ayear but sooner or later i regard it as certain that tippoo willstrive to obtain what his father failed to gainthe mastership of thecarnatic</s>  indeed he makes no secret of his intention to become lordof the whole of southern india</s>  the nizam his neighbour in the northfears his power and could offer but a feeble resistance were tippooonce master of the south and west coast</s>  the mahrattis can always bebought over especially if there is a prospect of plunder</s>  he reliestoo upon aid from france for although the french since the captureof pondicherry have themselves lost all chance of obtaining indiathey would gladly aid in any enterprise that would bring about thefall of english predominance here</s> there are too considerable bodies of french troops in the pay ofthe nizam and these would at any rate force their master to remainneutral in a struggle between the english and tippoo</s> however it will be quite unnecessary that you should resume ourgarb or that dick should dress in the same fashion</s>  did i intend toremain at tripataly i should not wish to draw the attention of myneighbours to the fact that i had english relations resident with me</s> of course every one knows that i am half english myself but that isan old story now</s>  they would however be reminded of it and tippoowould hear of it and would use it as a pretext for attacking andplundering us</s>  but as i have decided to come down here there is noreason why you should not dress in european fashion</s> we would remain here brother mrs</s>  holland said rather than bringdanger upon you</s>  dick could learn the ways of the country here aswell as with you and could start on his search without going totripataly</s> not at all margaret</s>  whether you are with me or not i shall have toleave tripataly when tippoo advances and your presence will not inany way affect my plans</s>  my wife and sons must travel with me and onewoman and boy more or less will make no difference</s>  at present thisscheme of yours seems to me to border on madness</s>  but we need notdiscuss that now</s>  i shall at any rate be very glad to have you bothwith me</s>  the english side of me has been altogether in the backgroundsince you went away and though i keep up many of the customs ourmother introduced i have almost forgotten the tongue though i forcemyself to speak it sometimes with my boys as i am sure that in thelong run the english will become the sole masters of southern indiaand it will be a great advantage to them to speak the language</s> however i have many other things to see about and the companionshipof dick will benefit them greatly</s>  you know what it always is outhere</s>  the sons of a rajah are spoilt early by every one giving wayto them and their being allowed to do just as they like</s>  naturallythey get into habits of indolence and self indulgence and never haveoccasion to exert themselves or to obtain the strength and activitythat make our mothers countrymen irresistible in battle</s>  they havebeen taught to shoot and to ride but they know little else and i amsure it will do them an immense deal of good to have dick with themfor a time</s> if nothing comes of this search for your husband i hope you willtake up your residence permanently at tripataly</s>  you have nothing togo back to england for and dick with his knowledge of bothlanguages should be able to find good employment in the companysservice</s> thank you greatly brother</s>  if as you say my quest should come tonothing i would gladly settle down in my old home</s>  dicksinclinations at present turn to the sea but i have no doubt thatwhat you say is true and that there may be far more advantageousopenings for him out here</s>  however that is a matter for us to talkover in the future</s> the rajah stayed four days at madras</s>  every morning the carriage cameat nine oclock to fetch mrs</s>  holland who spent several hours withher brother and was then driven back to the hotel while dickwandered about with rajbullub through the native town askingquestions innumerable observing closely the different costumes andturbans and learning to know at once the district trade or castefrom the colour or fashion of the turban and other little signs</s> the shops were an endless source of amusement to him and he somewhatsurprised his companion by his desire to learn the names of all thelittle articles and trinkets even of the various kinds of grain</s> dick in fact was continuing his preparations for his work</s>  he knewthat ignorance of any trifling detail which would as a matter ofcourse be known to every native would excite more surprise andsuspicion than would be caused by a serious blunder in other mattersand he wrote down in a notebook every scrap of information heobtained so as to learn it by heart at his leisure</s> rajbullub was much surprised at the lads interest in all these littlematters which as it seemed to him were not worth a thought on thepart of his lords nephew</s> you will never have to buy these things sahib he said</s>  why shouldyou trouble about them</s> i am going to be over here some time rajbullub and it is just aswell to learn as much as one can</s>  if i were to stroll into the marketin tripataly and had a fancy to buy any trifle the country peoplewould laugh in my face were i ignorant of its name</s> his companion shook his head</s> they would not expect any white sahib to know such things he said</s> if he wants to buy anything the white sahib points to it and askshow much</s>  then whether it is a brass iota or a silver trinket ora file or a bunch of fruit the native says a price four times asmuch as he would ask anyone else</s>  then the sahib offers him half andafter protesting many times that the sum is impossible the dealeraccepts it and both parties are well satisfied</s> if you have seen anything that you want to buy sahib tell me and iwill go and get it for you</s>  then you will not be cheated</s> the start for tripataly was made at daybreak</s>  dick and his motherdrove in an open carriage that had been hired for the journey</s>  therajah rode beside it or cantered on ahead</s>  his escort followed thevehicle</s>  the luggage had been sent off two days before by cart</s> the country as far as arcot was flat but everything was interestingto dick and when they arrived at the city where they were to stopfor the night at the house the rajah had occupied on his way down hesallied out as soon as their meal was over to inspect the fort andwalls</s>  he had during his outward voyage eagerly studied the historyof clives military exploits and the campaigns by which that portionof india had been wrested from the french and he was eager to visitthe fort whose memorable defence by clive had first turned thescale in favour of the british</s>  these had previously been regarded bythe natives as a far less warlike people than the french who wereexpected to drive them in a very short time out of the country</s> rajbullub was able to point out to him every spot associated with thestirring events of that time</s> tis fortysix years back and i was but a boy of twelve but sixyears later i was here for our rajah was on the side of the englishalthough tripataly was and is now under the nabob of arcot</s>  but mylord had many causes of complaint against him and when he declaredfor the french our lord who was not then a rajah although chief ofa considerable district threw in his lot with the english and whenthey triumphed was appointed rajah by them and tripataly was madealmost wholly independent of the nabob of arcot</s>  at one time a forceof our men was here with four companies of white troops when it wasthought that dupleix was likely to march against us and i was withthat force and so learned all about the fighting here</s> the next day the party arrived late in the evening at tripataly</s>  alarge number of men with torches received them in front of thepalace and on entering mrs</s>  holland was warmly received by therajahs wife who carried her off at once to her apartments which shedid not leave afterwards as she was greatly fatigued by the two longdays of travel</s> dick on the contrary although he had dozed in the carriage for thelast two or three hours of the journey woke up thoroughly as theyneared tripataly</s>  as soon as they entered the house the rajah calledhis two sons handsome darkfaced lads of twelve and thirteen</s> this is your cousin boys he said</s>  you must look after him andsee that he has everything he wants and make his stay as pleasant asyou can</s> although a little awed by the to them tall figure they evincedneither shyness or awkwardness but advancing to dick held out theirhands one after the other with grave courtesy</s>  their faces bothbrightened as he said in their own languagei hope we shall be great friends cousins</s>  i am older and bigger thanyou are but everything is new and strange to me and i shall have todepend upon you to teach me everything</s> we did not think that you would be able to talk to us the elderwhose name was doast assud said smiling</s>  we have been wondering howwe should make you understand</s>  many of the white officers who comehere sometimes speak our language but none of them as well as youdo</s> you see they only learn it after they come out here while i learntit from my mother who has talked to me in it since i was quite alittle boy so it comes as naturally to me as to you</s> in a few minutes supper was announced</s>  the two boys sat down withtheir father and dick and the meal was served in english fashion</s> dick had already become accustomed to the whiterobed servants at thehotel at madras and everything seemed to him pleasant and homelike</s> tomorrow dick his uncle said you must have your first lesson inriding</s> the two boys looked up in surprise</s>  they had been accustomed to horsesfrom their earliest remembrance and it seemed to them incredible thattheir tall cousin should require to be taught</s>  dick smiled at theirlook of astonishment</s> it is not with us in england as it is here he said</s>  boys wholive in the country learn to ride but in london which is a verygreat town with nothing but houses for miles and miles everywherefew people keep horses to ride</s>  the streets are so crowded withvehicles of all sorts and with people on foot that it is no pleasureto ride in them and everyone who can afford it goes about in acarriage</s>  those who cannot go in hired vehicles or on foot</s>  youwould hardly see a person on horseback once in a week</s> i do not like walking doast said gravely</s> well you see you have no occasion to walk as you always have yourhorses</s>  besides the weather here is very hot</s>  but in england it iscolder and walking is a pleasure</s>  i have walked over twenty miles aday many times not because i had to do it but as a days pleasurewith a friend</s> can you shoot cousin</s> no dick laughed</s>  there is nothing to shoot at</s>  there are no wildbeasts in england and no game birds anywhere near london</s> dick saw at once that he had descended many steps in his cousinsestimation</s> then what can you find to do</s>  the younger boy asked</s> oh there is plenty to do dick said</s>  in the first place there isschool</s>  that takes the best part of the day</s>  then there are all sortsof games</s>  then i used to take lessons in sword exercise and did allsorts of things to improve my muscles and to make me strong</s>  then onholidays three or four of us would go for a long walk and sometimeswe went out on the river in a boat and every morning early we usedto go for a swim</s>  oh i can tell you there was plenty to do and iwas busy from morning till night</s>  but i want very much to learn toshoot both with gun and pistol as well as to ride</s> we have got english guns and pistols doast said</s>  we will lend themto you</s>  we have a place where we practise</s> our father says everyone ought to be able to shootdont youfather</s> the rajah nodded</s> everyone out here ought to doast because you see every man heremay be called upon to fight and everyone carries arms</s>  but it isdifferent in england</s>  nobody fights there except those who go intothe army and nobody carries weapons</s> what</s>  not swords pistols and daggers father</s>  doast exclaimed insurprise for to him it seemed that arms were as necessary a part ofattire as a turban and much more necessary than shoes</s>  but whenpeople are attacked by marauders or two chiefs quarrel with eachother what can they do if they have no arms</s> there are no marauders and no chiefs dick laughed</s>  in the oldtimes hundreds of years ago there were nobles who could call out alltheir tenants and retainers to fight their battles and in those dayspeople carried swords as they do here</s>  there are nobles still butthey have no longer any power to call out anyone and if they quarrelthey have to go before a court for the matter to be decided just aseveryone else does</s> this seemed to doast a very unsatisfactory state of things and helooked to his father for an explanation</s> it is as your cousin says doast</s>  you have been down with me tomadras and you have seen that except the officers in the army noneof the europeans carry arms</s>  it is the same in england</s>  england is agreat island and as they have many ships of war no enemy can landthere</s>  there is one king over the whole country and there are writtenlaws by which everyone high and low alike are governed</s>  so you seeno one has to carry arms</s>  all disputes are settled by the law andthere is peace everywhere for as nothing would be settled byfighting and the law would punish any one however much in the righthe might be who fought there is no occasion at all for weapons</s>  itis a good plan for you see no one however rich can tyrannise overothers and were the greatest noble to kill the poorest peasant thelaw would hang him just the same as it would hang a peasant whokilled a lord</s> and now boys you had better be off to bed</s>  your cousin has had along day of it and i have no doubt he will be glad to do so</s>  tomorrowwe will begin to teach him to ride and to shoot and i have no doubtthat he will be ready in return to teach you a great deal about hiscountry</s> the boys got up</s>  but doast paused to ask his father one last question</s> but how is it father if the english never carry weapons and neverfight that they are such brave soldiers</s>  for have they not conqueredall our princes and rajahs and have even beaten tippoo sahib andmade him give them much of his country</s> the answer would be a great deal too long to be given tonight doast</s> you had better ask your cousin about it in the morning</s> chapter 4 first impressions</s> the next morning dick was up early eager to investigate the palaceof which he had seen little the night before</s>  the house was large andhandsome the rajah having added to it gradually every year</s>  onpassing the doors the great hall was at once entered</s>  its roof ofelaborately carved stones was supported by two rows of pillars withsculptured capitals</s>  the floor was made of inlaid marble and at oneend was raised a foot above the general level</s>  here stood a stonechair on which the rajah sat when he adjudicated upon disputes amonghis people heard petitions and gave audiences while a massive dooron the lefthand side gave entrance to the private apartments</s>  thesewere all small in comparison with the entrance hall</s>  the walls werelined with marble

windows here were low and afforded a view over thegarden</s>  next to it were several apartments all fitted with divansbut with low windows and a bright outlook</s>  they could be darkenedduring the

thethin slabs of stone that filled the orifices</s> the grounds round the palace were thickly planted with trees whichconstituted a grove rather than a garden according to dicks englishnotions</s>  this was indeed the great object of the planter andnumerous fountains added to the effect of the overhanging foliage</s> dick wandered about delighted</s>  early as it was men with water skinswere at work among the clumps of flowers and shrubs that covered theground wherever there was a break among the trees</s>  here and there weresmall pavilions whose roofs of sculptured stone were supported byshafts of marble</s>  the foliage of shrubs and trees alike was new todick and the whole scene delighted him</s>  half an hour later his twocousins joined him</s> we wondered what had become of you

weather when we have fruit sherbet</s>  after that weride or shoot till the sun gets hot and then come in to the morningmeal at ten</s> on going in dick found that his mother and the ranee were both upand they all sat down to what dick considered a breakfast consistingof coffee and a variety of fruit and bread</s>  one or two dishes of meatwere also handed round but were taken away untouched</s> now come out to the stables dick the rajah said</s>  anwar theofficer who commanded the escort will meet us there</s>  he will be yourinstructor</s> the stables were large</s>  the horses were fastened to rings along eachside and were not as in england separated from each other bystalls</s>  a small stone trough with running water was fixed againsteach wall at a convenient height and beneath this was a pile offodder before each horse</s> this is the one that i have chosen for you the rajah said stoppingbefore a pretty creature that possessed a considerable proportion ofarab blood as was shown by its small head</s>  it is very gentle andwell trained and is very fast</s>  when you have got perfectly at easeupon it you shall have something more difficult to sit until you areable to ride any horse in the stable bare backed</s>  murad is to be yourown property as long as you are out here</s> a syce led the horse out</s>  it was bridled but unsaddled and anwar gavea few instructions to dick and then saidi will help you up but in a short time you will learn to vault on tohis back without any assistance</s>  see</s>  you gather your reins so inyour left hand place your right hand on its shoulder and then springup</s> i can do that now dick laughed and placing his hand on thehorses shoulder he lightly vaulted into his seat</s> well done dick the rajah said while the two boys who had beenlooking on with amused faces clapped their hands</s> now sahib anwar went on you must let your legs hang easily</s> press with your knees and let your body sway slightly with themovement of the horse</s>  balance yourself rather than try to hold on</s> i understand dick said</s>  it is just as you do on board ship whenshe is rolling a bit</s>  let go the reins</s> for half an hour the horse proceeded at a walk along the road thatwound in and out through the parklike grounds</s> i begin to feel quite at home dick said at the end of that time</s> i should like to go a bit faster now</s>  it is no odds if i do tumbleoff</s> shake your rein a little</s>  the horse will understand it anwar said</s> dick did so and murad at once started at a gentle canter</s>  easy as itwas dick thought several times that he would be off</s>  however hegripped as tightly as he could with his knees and as he becameaccustomed to the motion and learned to give to it acquired ease andconfidence</s>  he was not however sorry when at the end of anotherhalf hour anwar held up his hand as he approached him and the horsestopped at the slightest touch of the rein</s> as he slid off his legs felt as if they did not belong to him andhis back ached so that he could scarce straighten it</s>  the rajah andhis sons had returned to the palace and the boys were there waitingfor him</s> you have done very well cousin doast said with grave approval</s> you will not be long before you can ride as well as we can</s>  now youhad better go up at once and have a bath and put on fresh clothes</s> dick felt that the advice was good as bathed in perspiration andstiff and sore in every limb he slowly made his way to his room</s> for the next month he spent the greater part of his time onhorseback</s>  for the first week he rode only in the grounds of thepalace then he ventured beyond accompanied by anwar on horsebackthen his two cousins joined the party and by the end of the monthhe was perfectly at home on murads back</s> so far he had not begun to practise shooting</s> it would be of no use the rajah said when he one day spoke of it</s> you want your nerves in good order for that and it requires an oldhorseman to have his hand steady enough for shooting straight after ahard ride</s>  your rides are not severe for a horseman but they aretrying for you</s>  leave the shooting alone lad</s>  there is no hurry forit</s> by this time the rajah had become convinced that it was useless totry and dissuade either his sister or dick from attempting theenterprise for which they had come over</s>  possibly the earnestconviction of the former that her husband was still alive influencedhim to some extent and the strength and activity of dick showed himthat he was able to play the part of a man</s>  he said little butwatched the boy closely made him go through trials of strength withsome of his troopers and saw him practise with blunted swords withothers</s>  dick did well in both trials and the rajah then requestedanwar who was celebrated for his skill with the tulwar to give himdaily halfanhours sword play after his riding lesson</s>  he himselfundertook to teach him to use the rifle and pistol</s> dick threw himself into his work with great ardour and in a veryshort time could sit any horse in the stable and came to use a rifleand pistol with an amount of accuracy that surprised his youngcousins</s> the boy is getting on wonderfully well the rajah said one day tohis sister</s>  his exercises have given him so much nerve and so steadya hand that he already shoots very fairly</s>  i should expect him togrow up into a fine man margaret were it not that i have the gravestfears as to this mad enterprise which i cannot help telling you bothfor your good and his is in my opinion absolutely hopeless</s> i know mortiz she said that you think it is folly on my partto cling to hope and while i do not disguise from myself that therewould seem but small chance that my husband has survived and that ican give no reason for my faith in his still being alive and myconfidence that he will be restored to me some day i have so firm aconviction that nothing will shake it</s>  why should i have such aconfidence if it were not well founded</s>  in my dreams i always seehim alive and i believe firmly that i dream of him so often becausehe is thinking of me</s> when he was at sea several times i felt disturbed and anxiousthough without any reason for doing so and each time on his returni found when we compared dates that his ship was battling with atempest at the time i was so troubled about him</s>  i remember that thefirst time this happened he laughed at me but when upon two otheroccasions it turned out so he saidthere are things we do not understand margaret</s>  you know that inscotland there are many who believe in second sight as it is calledand that there are families there and they say in ireland alsowhere a sort of warning is given of the death of a member of thefamily</s>  we sailors are a superstitious people and believe in thingsthat landsmen laugh at</s>  it does not seem to me impossible that whentwo people love each other dearly as we do one may feel when theother is in danger or may be conscious of his death</s>  it may be saidthat such things seldom happen but that is no proof that they neverdo so for some people may be more sensitive to such feelings orimpressions than others and you may be one of them</s> there is one thing margaret</s>  the fact that you have somehow feltwhen i was in trouble should cheer you when i am away for if meredanger should so affect you surely you will know should death befallme and as long as you do not feel that you may be sure that i shallreturn safe and sound to you</s> now i believe that firmly</s>  i was once troubledso troubled thatfor two or three days i was illand so convinced was i thatsomething had happened to jack and yet that he was not dead thatwhen nigh two years afterwards ben came home and i learned that itwas on the day of the wreck of his ship that i had so suffered i wasnot in the least surprised</s>  since then i have more than once had thesame feelings and have always been sure that at the time jack wasin special danger but i have never once felt that he was dead neveronce thought so and am as certain that he is still alive as if i sawhim sitting in the chair opposite to me for i firmly believe thatdid he die i should see his spirit or that at any rate i shouldknow for certain that he had gone</s> so whatever you say though reason may be altogether on your side itwill not shake my confidence one bit</s>  i know that jack is alive andi believe firmly although of this i am not absolutely sure that hewill someday be restored to me</s> you did not tell me this before margaret the rajah said and whatyou say goes for much with me</s>  here in india there are many who asis said possess this power that you call second sight</s>  certainlysome of the fakirs do</s>  i have heard many tales of warnings they havegiven and these have always come true</s>  i will not try in future todamp your confidence and will hope with you that your husband mayyet be restored to you</s> one evening dick remarkedyou said down at madras uncle that you would someday tell meabout the invasion by hyder ali</s>  will you tell me about it now</s> the rajah nodded</s>  his sons took their seats at his feet and dickcurled himself up on the divan by his side</s> you must know the rajah began that the war was really the resultof the intrigues of sir thomas rumbold the governor of madras andhis council</s>  in the first place they had seriously angered the nizam</s> the latter had taken a french force into his service which theenglish had compelled basult jung to dismiss and madras sent anofficer to his court with instructions to remonstrate with him for sodoing</s>  at the same time they gave him notice that they should nolonger pay to him the tribute they had agreed upon for the territorycalled the northern circars</s>  this would have led to war but thebengal government promptly interfered cancelled altogether thedemands made by the madras government and for the time patched up thequarrel</s>  the nizam professed to be satisfied but he saw that troublemight arise when the english were more prepared to enforce theirdemands</s>  he therefore entered into negotiations with hyder ali and themahrattis for an alliance whose object was the entire expulsion ofthe british from india</s> the mahrattis from poonah were to operate against bombay those incentral india and the north were to make incursions into bengal thenizam was to invade the northern circars and hyder was to direct hisforce against madras</s>  hyder at once began to collect military storesand obtained large quantities from the french at mahe a town theystill retain on the malabar coast</s> the madras government prepared to attack mahe when hyder informedthem that the settlements of the dutch french and english on themalabar coast being situated within his territory were equallyentitled to his protection and that if mahe were attacked he shouldretaliate by an incursion into the province of arcot</s>  in spite of thisthreat mahe was captured</s>  hyder for a time remained quiet but themadras government gave him fresh cause for offence by sending a forcein august 1779 to the assistance of basult jung at adoni</s> to get there this detachment had to pursue a route which led fortwo hundred miles through the most difficult passes and through theterritories both of the nizam and hyder</s>  the council altogetherignored the expressed determination of both these princes to opposethe march and did not even observe the civility of informing themthat they were going to send troops through their territory</s> i do not say dick that this made any real difference in the end</s> the alliance between the three native powers being made it wascertain that war would break out shortly</s>  still had it not been fortheir folly in giving hyder and the nizam a reasonable excuse forentering upon hostilities it might have been deferred until themadras government was better prepared to meet the storm</s> the bengal government fortunately again stepped in and undid atleast a part of the evil</s>  it took the entire management of affairs outof the hands of rumbolds council and its action was confirmed by theboard of directors who censured all the proceedings dismissed sirthomas rumbold and his two chief associates from the council andsuspended other members</s> the prompt and conciliatory measures taken by the bengal governmentappeased the resentment felt by the nizam and induced him to withdrawfrom the confederacy</s>  hyder however was bent upon war and theimbecile government here took no steps whatever to meet the storm</s> the commissariat was entirely neglected they had no transport trainwhatever and the most important posts were left without a garrison</s> it was towards the end of june that we received the news that hyderhad left his capital at the head of an army of ninety thousand men ofwhom twentyeight thousand were cavalry</s>  he attempted no disguise asto his object and moved confident in his power to conquer thecarnatic and drive the english into the sea</s> my father had already made his preparations</s>  everything was inreadiness and as soon as the news reached him he started for madrasunder the guard of his escort with my mother and myself most of thetraders of the town and the landowners who had gathered here in fearand trembling</s> it was a painful scene as you may imagine and i shall never forgetthe terrified crowds in the streets and the wailing of the women</s> many families who then left reached madras in safety but of those whoremained in the town all are dead or prisoners beyond the hills</s> hyder descended through the pass of changama on the 20th of july andhis horsemen spread out like a cloud over the country burningdevastating and slaughtering</s>  hyder moved with the main army slowlyoccupying town after town and placing garrisons in them</s> you must not suppose that he devastated the whole country</s>  he was toowise for that</s>  he anticipated reigning over it as its sovereign andhad no wish to injure its prosperity</s>  it was only over tracts where heconsidered that devastation would hamper the movements of an englisharmy that everything was laid waste</s> on the 21st of august he invested arcot and a week later hearingthat the british army had moved out from madras he broke up the siegeand advanced to meet them</s>  sir hector munro the british general wasno doubt brave but he committed a terrible blunder</s>  instead ofmarching to combine his force with that of colonel baillie who wascoming down from guntoor he marched in the opposite direction toconjeveram sending word to colonel baillie to follow him</s>  bailliesforce amounted to over two thousand eight hundred men munros to fivethousand two hundred</s>  had they united the force would have exceededeight thousand and could have given battle to hyders immense armywith fair hope of success</s>  the english have won before now withgreater odds against them</s> my father had marched out with his cavalry one hundred and fiftystrong with munro</s>  of course i was with him and it was to him thatthe english general gave the despatch to carry to colonel baillie</s>  werode hard for at any moment hyders cavalry might swoop down and barthe road but we got through safely and the next morning the 24thbaillie started</s> the encampment was within twentyfive miles of madras and with onelong forced march we could have effected a junction with munro</s>  theheat was tremendous and baillie halted that night on the bank of theriver cortelour</s>  the bed was dry and my father urged him to crossbefore halting</s>  the colonel replied that the men were too exhausted tomove farther and that as he would the next day be able to joinmunro it mattered not on which side of the river he encamped</s> that night the river rose and for ten days we were unable to cross</s> on the 4th of september we got over but by that time tippoo withfive thousand picked infantry six thousand horse six heavy guns anda large body of irregulars detached by hyder to watch us barred theway</s> colonel baillie finding that there was no possibility of reachingconjeveram without fighting took up a position at a village and onthe 6th was attacked by tippoo</s>  the action lasted three hours andalthough the enemy were four times more numerous than we were theenglish beat off the attacks</s>  we were not engaged for againsttippoos large cavalry force our few horsemen could do nothing andwere therefore forced to remain in the rear of the british line</s>  butthough colonel baillie had beaten off the attacks made on him he feltthat he was not strong enough to fight his way to conjeveram whichwas but fourteen miles distant and he therefore wrote to sir hectormunro to come to his assistance</s> for three days sir hector did nothing but on the evening of the 8thhe sent off a force composed of the flank companies of the regimentswith him</s>  these managed to make their way past the forces both ofhyder and tippoo and reached us without having to fire a shot</s> their arrival brought our force up to over three thousand sevenhundred men</s>  had munro made a feigned attack upon hyder and soprevented him from moving to reinforce tippoo we could have gotthrough without much difficulty</s>  but he did nothing and hyder seeingthe utter incapacity of the man opposed to him moved off with hiswhole army and guns to join his son</s> our force set out as soon as it was dark on the evening of the 9thbut the moment we started we were harassed by the enemys irregulars</s> the march was continued for five or six miles our position becomingmore and more serious and at last colonel baillie took the fatalresolution of halting till morning instead of taking advantage of thedarkness to press forward</s>  at daybreak fifty guns opened on us</s>  ourten field pieces returned the fire until our ammunition wasexhausted</s>  no orders were issued by the colonel who had completelylost his head so that our men were mowed down by hundreds until atlast the enemy poured down and slaughtered them relentlessly</s> we did not see the end of the conflict</s>  when the colonel gave theorders to halt my father said to methis foolish officer will sacrifice all our lives</s>  does he thinkthat three thousand men can withstand one hundred thousand with agreat number of guns</s>  we will go while we can</s>  we can do no goodhere</s> we mounted our horses and rode off</s>  in the darkness we came suddenlyupon a body of tippoos horsemen but dashed straight at them and cutour way through but with the loss of half our force and did not drawrein until we reached madras</s> the roar of battle had been heard at conjeveram and the fury andindignation in the camp at the desertion of colonel bailliesdetachment was so great that the general at last gave orders to marchto their assistance</s>  when his force arrived within two miles of thescene of conflict the cessation of fire showed that it was too lateand that baillies force was wellnigh annihilated</s>  munro retired toconjeveram and at three oclock the next morning retreated with theloss of all his heavy guns and stores to madras</s> the campaign only lasted twentyone days and was marked by almostincredible stupidity and incapacity on the part of the two englishcommanders</s>  we remained at madras</s>  my father determined that he wouldtake no more share in the fighting until some english generalpossessing the courage and ability that had always beforedistinguished them took the command</s>  in the meantime hydersurrounded and captured arcot after six weeks delay and then laidsiege to amboor chingleput and wandiwash</s> in november sir eyre coote arrived from england and took the command</s> confidence was at once restored for he was a fine old soldier andhad been engaged in every struggle in india from the time of clivebut with the whole country in the hands of hyder it was impossible toobtain draft animals or carts and it was not until the middle ofjanuary that he was able to move</s>  on the 19th he reached chingleputand on the 20th sent off a thousand men to obtain possession of thefort of carangooly</s>  it was a strong place and the works had beenadded to by hyder who had placed there a garrison of seven hundredmen</s>  the detachment would not have been sent against it had not newsbeen obtained on the way that the garrison had fallen back tochingleput</s> our troop of cavalry went with the detachment as my father knew thecountry well</s>  to the surprise of captain davis who was in command wefound the garrison on the walls</s> what do you think rajah</s>  captain davis who was riding by hisside asked</s>  my orders were that i was to take possession of theplace but it was supposed that i should find it empty</s> i should say that you had better try with or without orders myfather replied</s>  the annihilation of baillies force and themiserable retreat of munro have made a terribly bad impressionthrough the country and a success is sorely needed to raise thespirits of our friends</s> we will do it captain davis said and called up a few englishengineers and a company of white troops he had with him and orderedthem to blow in the gate</s> my father volunteered to follow close behind them with hisdismounted cavalry and when the word was given forward we went</s>  itwas hot work i can tell you</s>  the enemys guns swept the road andtheir musketry kept up an incessant roar</s>  many fell but we kept onuntil close to the gate and then the white troops opened fire uponhyders men on the walls so as to cover the sappers who were fixingthe powder bags</s> they soon ran back to us</s>  there was a great explosion and the gatesfell</s>  with loud shouts we rushed forward into the fort and closebehind us came the sepoys led by captain davis</s> it took some sharp fighting before we overcame the resistance of thegarrison who fought desperately knowing well enough that after themassacre of baillies force little quarter would be given them</s>  thebritish loss was considerable and twenty of my fathers littlecompany were among the killed</s>  great stores of provisions were foundhere and proved most useful to the army</s> the news of the capture of carangooly so alarmed the besiegers ofwandiwash that they at once raised the siege and retreated and onthe following day sir eyre coote and his force arrived there</s>  it wasa curious thing that on the same day of the same month sir eyrecoote had twentyone years before raised the siege of wandiwash by avictory over the army that was covering the operation</s>  wandiwash hadbeen nobly defended by a young lieutenant named flint who had madehis way in through the enemys lines a few hours before thetreacherous native officer in command had arranged with hyder tosurrender it and taking command had repulsed every attack and hadeven made a sortie</s> there was now a long pause</s>  having no commissariat train sir eyrecoote was forced to make for the seashore and though hotly followedby hyder reached cuddalore</s>  a french fleet off the coast howeverprevented provisions being sent to him and even after the french hadretired the madras government were so dilatory in forwarding suppliesthat the army was reduced to the verge of starvation</s> it was not until the middle of june that a movement was possibleowing to the want of carriage</s>  the country inland had been swept bareby hyder and on leaving cuddalore sir eyre coote was obliged tofollow the seacoast</s>  when he arrived at porto novo the army wasdelighted to find a british fleet there and scarcely less pleased tohear that lord macartney had arrived as governor of madras</s> hyders army had taken up a strong position between the camp andcuddalore and sir eyre coote determined to give him battle</s>  fourdays rice was landed from the fleet and with this scanty supply intheir knapsacks the troops marched out to attack hyder</s>  we formedpart of the baggage guard and had therefore an excellent opportunityof seeing the fight</s>
 the march was by the sea</s>  the infantry moved inorder of battle in two lines</s>  after going for some distance we couldsee the enemys position plainly</s>  it was a very strong one</s>  on itsright was high ground on which were numerous batteries which wouldtake us in flank as we advanced and their line extended from theseheights to the sand hills by the shore</s> they had thrown up several batteries and might for aught we knewhave many guns hidden on the high ground on either flank</s>  an hour wasspent in reconnoitring the enemys position during which they kept upan incessant cannonade to which the english field guns attempted noreply</s>  to me and the officers of this troop it seemed impossiblethat any force could advance to the attack of hyders position withoutbeing literally swept away by the crossfire that would be opened uponit but when i expressed my fears my father saidno you will see no repetition of that terrible affair withbaillies column</s>  the english have now got a commander who knows hisbusiness and when that is the case there is never any fear as towhat the result will be</s>  i grant that the lookout seems desperate</s> hyder has all the advantage of a very strong position a very powerfulartillery and has six or seven to one in point of numbers but forall that i firmly believe that before night you will see us inpossession of those hills and hyders army in full flight</s> presently we saw a movement</s>  the two lines of infantry formed intocolumns and instead of advancing towards hyders position turneddown towards the sea and marched along between it and the sand hills</s> we were at the same time set in motion and kept along between theinfantry and the sea so as to be under their protection if hyderscavalry should sweep down</s>  all his preparations had been made underthe supposition that we should advance by the main road to cuddaloreand this movement entirely disconcerted his plans</s>  the sand hillscompletely protected our advancing columns and when they had reacheda point almost in line with hyders centre the artillery dashed up tothe crest of the hills and the first column passed through a break inthem and moved forward against the enemy the guns above clearing away for them</s> a short halt was made until the artillery of the second line cameup and also took their position on the hill</s>  then the first columnwith its guns moved forward again</s> hyder had in the meantime moved back his line and batteries into aposition at right angles to that they had before occupied and facingthe passage through the sand hills by which the english wereadvancing</s>  as soon as the column issued from the valley a tremendousfire was poured upon it but it again formed into line of battle andcovered by the fire of the artillery moved forward</s> it was a grand sight</s>  my father and i had left the baggage whichremained by the sea and had ridden up on to a sand hill from whichwe had a view of the whole of the battleground</s>  it was astonishing tosee the line of english infantry advancing under that tremendousfire against the rising ground occupied by the dense masses of theenemy</s> presently there was a movement opposite and a vast body of cavalrymoved down the slope</s>  as they came the red english line suddenly brokeup and as if by magic a number of small squares surrounded byglistening bayonets appeared where it had stood</s> down rode hyders cavalry</s>  every gun on our side was turned uponthem</s>  but though we could see the confusion in the ranks caused bythe shot that swept them they kept on</s>  it seemed that the little redpatches must be altogether overwhelmed by the advancing wave</s>  but asit came closer flashes of fire spurted out from the faces of thesquares</s>  we could see the horses recoil when close to the bayonetsand then the stream poured through the intervals between the squares</s> as they did so crackling volleys broke out while from the batterieson the sand hills an incessant fire was kept up upon them</s>  thenfollowing the volleys came the incessant rattle of musketry</s>  theconfusion among the cavalry grew greater and greater</s>  regiments weremixed up together and their very numbers impeded their action</s>  manygallant fellows detaching themselves from the mass rode bravely atthe squares and died on the bayonets others huddled togetherconfused and helpless against the storm of bullets and shot and atlast as if with a sudden impulse they rode off in all directionsand sweeping round regained their position in the rear of theirinfantry while loud cheers broke from our side</s> the squares again fell into line which advancing steadily drovehyders infantry before it</s>  as this was going on a strong force ofinfantry and cavalry with guns was moved round by hyder to fall onthe british rear</s>  these however were met by the second line whichhad hitherto remained in reserve and after fierce fighting weredriven back along the sand hills</s>  but as they were retiring the mainbody of hyders cavalry moved round to support the attack</s>  fortunatelya british schooner which had sailed from porto novo when the troopsstarted had anchored near the shore to give what protection she couldto the baggage and now opened fire with her guns upon the cavalry asthey rode along between the sand hills and the sea and with sucheffect that they halted and wavered and when two of the batteries onthe sand hills also opened fire upon them they fell back in haste</s> this was hyders last effort</s>  the british line continued to advanceuntil it had gained all the positions occupied by the enemy and thesewere soon in headlong flight hyder himself who had been almostforced by his attendants to leave the ground being with them</s>
 it wasa wonderful victory</s>  the english numbered but 8476 men of whom 306were killed or wounded</s>  hyders force was about 65000 and his losswas not less than 10000</s> the victory had an immense effect in restoring the confidence of theenglish troops which had been greatly shaken by the misfortunescaused by the incapacity of munro and baillie</s>  but it had no otherconsequences for want of carriage and a deficiency of provisions andequipment prevented sir eyre coote from taking the offensive and hewas obliged to confine himself to capturing a few forts near thecoast</s> on the 27th of august the armies met again hyder having chosen thescene of his victory over baillies force to give battle believingthe position to be a fortunate one for himself</s>  hyder had now beenjoined by tippoo who had not been present at the last battle and hisforce numbered 80000 men while the english were 11000 strong</s> i did not see the battle as we were at the time occupied inescorting a convoy of provisions from madras</s>  the fight was muchbetter contested than the previous battle had been</s>  hyder was wellacquainted with the ground and made skilful use of his opportunitiesby fortifying all the points at which he could be attacked</s>  the fightlasted eight hours</s>  at last sir eyre cootes first division turned theenemys left flank by the capture of the village of pillalore whilehis second turned their right and hyder was obliged to fall back</s>  butthis was done in good order and the enemy claimed that it was a drawnbattle</s>  this however was not the case as the english at nightencamped on the position occupied by hyder in the morning</s> still the scandalous mismanagement at madras continued to crippleus</s>  but learning from the commandant at vellore that unless he wererelieved he would be driven to surrender for want of provisions sireyre coote marched to his help</s>  he met the enemy on the way</s>  hyder wastaken by surprise and was moving off when the english arrived</s>  inorder to give his infantry time to march away he hurled the whole ofhis cavalry against the english</s>  again and again they charged downwith the greatest bravery and although the batteries swept theirranks with grape and the squares received them with deadly volleysthey persevered until tippoo had carried off his infantry and gunsand then having lost five thousand men followed him</s>  the englishthen moved on towards vellore</s>  hyder avoided another encounter andvellore was relieved</s>  sir eyre coote handed over to its commandantalmost the whole of the provisions carried by the army and havingthus supplied the garrison with sufficient food for six weeks marchedback to madras his troops suffering greatly from famine on the way</s> nothing took place during the winter except that sir eyre cooteagain advanced and revictualled vellore</s>  in march a french fleetarrived off the coast landed a force of three thousand men to assisthyder and informed him that a much larger division was on its way</s> fortunately this did not arrive many of the ships being captured bythe english on their way out</s>  in the course of the year there wereseveral fights but none of any consequence and things remained inthe same state until the end of the year when on the 7th ofdecember hyder died and tippoo was proclaimed his successor</s> bussy arrived with fresh reinforcements from france in april andtook the command of hyders french contingent and in june there was abattle between him and a force commanded by general stuart thesuccessor to sir eyre coote who had been obliged to resign from illhealth and who had died in the spring</s> the french position was a very strong one and was protected bynumerous field works</s>  the battle was the most sanguinary fought duringthe war considering the numbers engaged</s>  the english carried aportion of the works and captured fourteen guns and as the frenchretired during the night were able to claim a victory</s>  their losshowever was over a thousand while that of the french was not morethan a third of that number</s> during that year there was little fighting down here</s>  a bombay forcehowever under the command of general matthews captured bednore buttippoo hastened against him with a great force besieged bednore andforced it to surrender after a desperate defence</s>  tippoo violated theterms of capitulation and made the defenders prisoners</s>  bangalore wasnext besieged by him but resisted for nearly nine months and onlysurrendered in january 1784</s> tippoo had by this time lost the services of his frenchauxiliaries as england and france had made peace at home</s> negotiations between tippoo and the english went on till march when atreaty was signed</s>  by its provisions tippoo should have handed backall his prisoners</s>  he murdered large numbers of them but 1000 britishsoldiers and 1600 sepoys obtained their liberty</s>  no one knows howmany were retained of the number calculated at 200000 of nativescarried off from the countries overrun by hyders troops</s>  only 2000were released</s> more british would doubtless have been freed had it not been for thescandalous cowardice of the three men sent up as britishcommissioners to tippoo</s>  they were treated with the greatest insultand contempt by him and in fear of their lives were too glad toaccept the prisoners he chose to hand over without troublingthemselves in the slightest about the rest whom they basely desertedand left to their fate</s> chapter 5 war declared</s> that gives you a general idea dick of the war with tippoo</s>  i sawlittle of the events after the battle of porto novo as my father wastaken ill soon after and died at madras</s>  seeing that there was noprobability whatever of the english driving hyder back until theyhad much larger forces and a much better system of management iremained in madras until peace was made then i came back hererebuilt the palace and have since been occupied in trying to restorethe prosperity of my poor people</s> it is i feel a useless task for it is certain that ere long theenglish will again be engaged with mysore and if they are it iswellnigh certain that tippoos hordes will again sweep down from thehills and carry ruin and desolation everywhere</s> he would as hyder had have the advantage on his side at thebeginning of the war</s>  he has a score of passes to choose from and candescend on to the plain by any one he may select</s>  and even were therea force here capable of giving battle to the whole mysorean army itcould not watch all the passes as to do so the army would have to bebroken up into a dozen commands</s>  tippoo will therefore again be ableto ravage the plains for weeks perhaps before the english can forcehim to give battle</s> but there is no army at present in existence of sufficient strengthto meet him</s>  the madras force would have to wait until reinforcementsarrived from calcutta</s>  it was bad before but it will be worse now</s> hyder no doubt slaughtered many but he was not cruel by nature</s>  hecarried off enormous quantities of people with their flocks andherds but he did this to enrich mysore with their labour and did nottreat them with unnecessary cruelty</s> tippoo on the other hand is a human tiger</s>  he delights in torturinghis victims and slays his prisoners from pure love of bloodshed</s>  heis proud of the title of tiger</s>  his footstool is a tigers head andthe uniforms of his infantry are a sort of imitation of a tigersstripes</s>  he has military talent and showed great judgment in commandof his divisionindeed most of the successes gained during the lastwar were his work</s>  since then he has laboured incessantly to improvehis army</s>  numbers of regiments have been raised composed of thecaptives carried off from here and from the west coast</s>  they aredrilled in european fashion by the english captives he still holdsin his hands</s> but why uncle instead of giving time to tippoo to come down hereshould we not march up the passes and compel him to keep his army upthere to defend seringapatam</s> because dick in the first place there is not an army strong enoughto do so but even were there a force of fifty thousand men at madrasthey could not take the offensive in time</s>  an english army cannot movewithout a great train to carry ammunition stores and provisions andto get such a train together would be the work of months</s>  as i havebeen telling you during the three years the last war lasted themadras authorities were never able to collect such a train and theconsequence was that their army was unable to go more than two orthree days march from the city</s> on the other hand tippoo could any day order that three dayssupply of rice or grain should be served out to each soldier andcould set out on his march the following morning as from the momenthe reached the plains his cavalry would have the whole of theresources of the country at their mercy</s> i see uncle</s>  then if war broke out you would at once go to madrasagain</s> there would be nothing else to do dick</s>  i should send everything ofvalue down there as soon as i saw that war was inevitable</s>  thetraders here have already begun to prepare</s>  the shops are half emptyfor they have not replaced goods they have sold and a very few hourswould suffice for everything worth taking to be cleared out of thetown</s>  the country round here is comparatively uninhabited and but asmall portion of it tilled so great was the number carried off byhyder</s>  next time they will take to the hills at once and i believethat many have already stored up grain in hiding places there</s>  thistime it may be hoped that a few weeks or months at most may seetippoo driven back and for that time the peasants can manage to existin the hills</s>  no doubt the richer sort who have large flocks ofgoats and many cattle will as soon as danger threatens drive themdown to madras where they are sure to fetch good prices for the useof the army</s> i have already told all men who have bullock carts and teams thatthey can if forced to leave home earn a good living by takingservice in the english transport train</s>  i hope therefore that theresults will not be so disastrous as before</s>  the town may be burntdown again but unless they blow up my palace they can do little harmto it</s>  when i rebuilt it seeing the possibility of another war iwould not have any wood whatever used in its construction</s>  thereforewhen the hangings are taken down and the furniture from these roomscleared out there will be nothing to burn and they are not likely towaste powder in blowing it up</s> as to the town i warned the people who returned that it might beagain destroyed before long and therefore there has been no solidbuilding</s>  the houses have all been lightly run up with wood which isplentiful enough in the hills and no great harm therefore will bedone if it is again burnt down</s>  the pagoda and palace are the onlystone buildings in it</s>  they did some harm to the former last time byfiring shot at it for a day or two and as you can see for yourselfno attempt has since been made to repair it and i do not suppose theywill trouble to damage it further</s> so you see dick we are prepared for the worst</s> will you fight again as you did last time uncle</s> i do not know dick</s>  i show my loyalty to the english rule byrepairing to the capital but my force is too small to render muchservice</s>  you see my revenues have greatly diminished and i cannotafford to keep up so large a force as my father could</s>  fortunatelyhis savings had been considerable and from these i was able to buildthis palace and to succour my people and have still enough to keepup my establishment here without pressing the cultivators of the soilfor taxes</s>  this year is the first that i have drawn any revenue fromthat source but at any rate i am not disposed to keep up a forcewhich while it would be insufficient to be of any great value in awar like this would be a heavy tax on my purse</s> even the force you have must be that uncle</s> not so much as you would think dick with your english notions</s>  thepay here is very smallso small that it would seem to you impossiblefor a man to live on it and yet many of these men have wives andfamilies</s>  all of them have patches of land that they cultivate onlytwenty who are changed once a month being kept on duty</s>  they arenecessary for i should have but little respect from my people andless still from other rajahs did i not have sentries at the gatesand a guard ready to turn out in honour of any visitor who mightarrive to say nothing of an escort of half a dozen men when i ridethrough the country</s>  of course all can be called out whenever i wantthem as for example when i rode to madras to meet you</s>  the menthink themselves well off upon the pay of three rupees a month asthey are practically only on duty two months each year and have therest of the time to cultivate their fields</s>  therefore with the pay ofthe officers my troop only costs me about four hundred rupees amonth which is you know equivalent to forty english pounds so thatyou cannot call it an expensive army even if it is kept for showrather than use</s> no indeed uncle</s>  it seems ridiculous that a troop of a hundred mencan be kept up for five hundred pounds a year</s> of course the men have some little privileges dick</s>  they pay norent or taxes for their lands</s>  this is a great thing for them andreally costs me nothing as there is so much land lying uncultivated</s> then when too old for service they have a pension of two rupees amonth for life and on that and what little land they can cultivatethey are comparatively comfortable</s> well it does not seem to me uncle that soldiering is a good tradein this country</s> i dont know that it is a good trade in the money way anywhere</s> after all the pay out here is quite as high in comparison with theordinary rate of earning of a peasant as it is in england</s>  it isnever the pay that tempts soldiers</s>  among young men there are alwaysgreat numbers who prefer the life to that of a peasant workingsteadily from daylight to dark and i dont know that i altogetherblame them</s> then you think uncle there is no doubt whatever that there will bewar</s> not a shadow of doubt dickindeed it may be said to have begunalready and like the last it is largely due to the incapacity ofthe government of madras</s> i have just received a message from arcot the rajah said twomonths later and i must go over and see the nabob</s> i thought mrs</s>  holland said that tripataly was no longer subjectto him</s>  i understood that our father was made independent of arcot</s> no margaret not exactly that</s>  the nabob had involved himself invery heavy debts during the great struggle</s>  the company had donesomething to help him but were unable to take all his debts on theirshoulders and indeed there was no reason why they should have doneso for although during most of the war he was their ally he wasfighting on his own behalf and not on theirs</s> in the war with hyder it was different</s>  he was then quite underenglish influence and indeed could scarcely be termed independent</s> and as he suffered terriblyhis lands were wasted his townsbesieged and his people driven off into slaverythe company are atpresent engaged in negotiations for assisting him to pay his debtswhich are very heavy</s> it was before you left when the nabob was much pressed for moneyand had at that time no claim on the company that our father boughtof him a perpetual commutation of tribute taxes and other monies andsubsidies payable by tripataly thus i am no longer tributary toarcot</s>  nevertheless this forms a portion of the nabobs territoriesand i cannot act as if i were an independent prince</s> i could not make a treaty with mysore on my own account and it isclear that neither arcot nor the english could allow me to do so forin that case mysore could erect fortresses here and could usetripataly as an advanced post on the plain</s>  therefore i am stillsubject to the nabob and could be called upon for military service byhim</s>  indeed that is one of the reasons why even if i could affordit i should not care to keep up a force of any strength</s>  as it is mytroop is too small to be worth summoning</s>  the nabob has remonstratedwith me more than once but since the war with hyder i have had a goodexcuse namely that the population has so decreased that my lands lieuntilled and it would be impossible for me to raise a larger force</s>  ihave however agreed that in case of a fresh war i will raise anadditional hundred cavalry</s> i expect it is in relation to this that he has sent for me to arcot</s> we know that the english are bound by their treaty with travancoreto declare war</s>  they ought in honour to have done it long ago butthey were unprepared</s>  now that they are nearly ready they may do soat any time and indeed the nabob may have learned that fighting hasbegun</s> the lookout is bad</s>  the government of madras is just as weak and asshort sighted as it was during hyders war</s>  there is but one comfortand that is that lord cornwallis at calcutta has far greater powerthan his predecessors and as he is an experienced soldier and issaid to be an energetic man he may bring up reinforcements fromcalcutta without loss of time and also set the troops of bombay inmotion</s>  i expect that as before things will go badly at first buthope that this time we shall end by giving mysore so heavy a lessonthat she will be powerless for mischief in future</s> and release all the captives mrs</s>  holland exclaimed clasping herhands</s> i sincerely trust so margaret her brother said gravely butafter what happened last time we must not be sanguine</s>  scatteredabout as they may be in the scores of little hill forts that dot thewhole country we can unhappily never be sure that all aredelivered when we have only the word of a treacherous tyrant liketippoo</s>  we know that last time he kept back hundreds of prisonersamong whom as we may hope was your husband and it may be thathowever completely he may be defeated he may yet retain some of themknowing full well it is impossible that all these hill forts and theirdungeons can be searched</s>  however doubtless if an english armymarches to seringapatam many will be recovered though we have reasonto fear that many will as before be murdered before our arrival</s> when the rajah returned from arcot on the following day he broughtback the news that general meadows had moved to the frontier atcaroor fifty miles beyond trichinopoly and that the war was reallyabout to begin</s> you know he said how matters stand up to now</s>  tippoo aftermaking peace with the nizam and the mahrattis with whom he had beenengaged in hostilities for some time turned his attention to thewestern coast where coorg and malabar had risen in rebellion</s>  afteras usual perpetrating horrible atrocities and after sending a largeproportion of the population as slaves to mysore he marched againsttravancore</s>  now travancore was specially mentioned in the treaty ofmangalore as one of the allies of the english with whom tippoo boundhimself not to make war and had he not been prepared to fight theenglish he would not have attacked their ally</s>  the excuse forattacking travancore was that some of the fugitives from coorg andmalabar had taken refuge there</s> seeing that tippoo was bent upon hostilities lord cornwallis and hiscouncil at calcutta directed as i learnt from an official at madrasthe authorities there to begin at once to make preparations for war</s> instead of doing so mr</s>  holland the governor gave the rajah theshameful and cowardly advice to withdraw his protection from thefugitives</s>  the rajah refused to comply with such counsel and aftersome months spent in negotiations tippoo attacked the wall that runsalong the northern frontier of travancore</s> that was about six months ago</s>  yes it was on the 28th ofdecemberso it is just six months</s>  his troops fourteen thousandstrong made their way without difficulty through a breach but theywere suddenly attacked by a small body of travancore men</s>  a panicseized them</s>  they rushed back to the breach and in the wild struggleto pass through it no less than two thousand were either killed orcrushed to death</s> it was nearly three months before tippoo renewed his attack</s>  thelines were weak and his army so strong that resistance wasimpossible</s>  a breach threequarters of a mile in length was made inthe wall and marching through this he devastated travancore from endto end</s> his unaccountable delay before assaulting the position has been ofgreat advantage to us</s>  had he attacked us at once instead of wastinghis time before travancore he would have found the carnatic asdefenceless and as completely at his mercy as hyder did</s>  he wouldstill have done so had it depended upon madras but as theauthorities here did nothing lord cornwallis took the matter into hisown hands</s>  he was about to come here himself when general meadowsformerly governor of bombay arrived invested by the company with theoffices of both governor and of commanderinchief</s> he landed here late in february and at once set to work to preparefor war</s>  lord cornwallis sent from calcutta a large amount of moneystores and ammunition and a battalion of artillerymen</s>  the sepoysobjected to travel by sea as their caste rules forbade them to do soand he therefore sent off six battalions of infantry by land and thenabob tells me they are expected to arrive in four or five weekstime</s>  the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore both of whom arevery heavily in debt to the government are ordered during thecontinuance of the war to place their revenues at its disposal aliberal allowance being made to them both for their personal expenses</s> tippoo is still in travancoreat least he was there ten days agoand has been endeavouring to negotiate</s>  the nabob tells me he believesthat the object of general meadows in advancing from trichinopoly tocaroor is to push on to coimbatoor where he will if he arrivesbefore tippoo cut him off from his return to his capital and asmeadows has a force of fifteen thousand men he ought to be able tocrush the tyrant at a blow</s> i fear however there is little chance of this</s>  the mysore troopsmove with great rapidity and as soon as tippoo hears that the englisharmy is marching towards caroor he is sure to take the alarm and bythis time has probably passed coimbatoor on his way back</s>  with all hisfaults tippoo is a good general and the nabobs opinionand i quiteagree with himis that as soon as he regains the table land ofmysore he will take advantage of the english army being far away tothe south and will pour down through the passes into this part of thecarnatic which is at present absolutely defenceless</s>  this being thecase i shall at once get ready to leave for madras and shall move assoon as i learn for certain that tippoo has slipped past theenglish</s> the nabob has called upon me to join him with my little body ofcavalry and as soon as the news comes that tippoo is descending thepasses i shall either join him or the english army</s>  that will be amatter to decide afterwards</s> you will take me with you of course uncle</s>  dick asked eagerly</s> certainly dick</s>  if you are old enough to undertake the reallyperilous adventure of going up in disguise to mysore you arecertainly old enough to ride with me</s>  besides we may hope that thistime the war is not going to be as onesided as it was the last timeand that we may end by reaching seringapatam in which case we mayrescue your father if he is still alive very much more easily thanit could be managed in the way you propose</s> the news that the english army had marched to caroor and that therewas no force left to prevent the mysoreans from pouring down from thehills spread quickly and when dick went out with the two boys intothe town groups of people were talking earnestly in the streets</s>  someof them came up and asked respectfully if there was any later news</s> nothing later than you have heard dick said</s> the rajah is not going away yet sahib</s> no he will not leave unless he hears that tippoo has returned withhis army to seringapatam</s>  then he will go at once for the sultanmight come down through the passes at any moment and can get here afortnight before the english army can return from caroor</s> yes it will be no use waiting here to be eaten up sahib</s>  do youthink conjeveram would be safe</s>  because it is easy to go down there byboat</s> i should think so</s>  hyder could not take it last time and the englisharmy is much stronger than it was then</s>  besides there will be sixthousand men arriving from bengal in a months time so i shouldthink there is no fear of conjeveram being taken</s> it is little trouble getting there the trader said but it is along journey to madras</s>  we could go down with our families and goodsin two days in a boat but there would not be boats enough for alland it will be best therefore that some should go at once for ifall wait until there is news that tippoo is coming many will not beable to get away in time</s> no not in boats dick agreed but in three days a bullock cartwould get you there</s> next day several of the shops containing the most valuable goods wereshut up and day by day the number remaining open grew smaller</s> it is as i expected the rajah said one morning as he came intothe room where the family was sitting</s>  a messenger has just come infrom the nabob with the news that sickness broke out among the armyas soon as they arrived at caroor and in twentyfour hours a thousandmen were in hospital</s>  this delayed the movement and when they arrivedat coimbatoor they were too late</s>  tippoo and his army had alreadypassed moving by forced marches back to mysore</s> finish your packing ladies</s>  we will start at daybreak tomorrowmorning</s>  i secured three boats four days ago and have been holdingthem in readiness</s>  rajbullub will go in charge of you</s>  there is notthe least fear of tippoo being here for another fortnight at theearliest</s> i shall ride with the troop</s>  dick and the boys will go with me</s>  weshall meet you at conjeveram</s>  i have already arranged with some of ourpeople who have gone on in their bullock carts with theirbelongings and will unload them there to be in readiness to take ourgoods on to madras so there will be no delay in getting forward</s> by nightfall the apartments were completely dismantled</s>  the furniturewas all stowed away in a vault which the rajah had had constructedfor the purpose when the palace was rebuilt</s>  access was obtained toit through the floor in one of the private apartments</s>  the floor wasof tessellated marble but some ten squares of it lifted up in a massforming together a trapdoor from which steps led down into the vault</s> when the block was lowered again the fit was so accurate that aftersweeping a little dust over the joint the opening was quiteimperceptible to any one not aware of the hiding place</s>  the cushionsof the divans were taken down here as well as the furniture and allthe less valuable carpets rugs and hangings while the costlierarticles were rolled up into bales for transport</s> the silver cups and other valuables were packed in boxes and wereduring the night carried by coolies down to the boats over which aguard was placed until morning</s>  provisions for the journey down theriver were also placed on board</s>  the palace was astir long beforedaybreak</s>  the cushions that had been slept on during the night werecarried down to the boats the boxes of wearing apparel closed andfastened and a hasty meal was taken</s> the sun was just rising when they started</s>  one boat had been fitted upwith a bower of green boughs for the use of the two ladies and theirfour attendants</s>  the other two carried the baggage</s> after seeing them push off the rajah his sons and dick returned tothe palace</s>  here for a couple of hours he held a sort of audience andgave his advice to the townspeople and others who came inconsiderable numbers to consult with him</s>  when this was done theywent into the courtyard where all was ready for their departure</s> the troop had during the past week been raised to two hundred menmany of the young cultivators coming eagerly forward as soon as theyheard that the rajah was going to increase his troop being anxious totake a share in the adventures that might be looked for and to avengethe sufferings that had been inflicted on their friends by hydersmarauders</s>  they were a somewhat motley troop but this matteredlittle as uniformity was unknown among the forces of the nativeprinces</s> the majority were stout young fellows</s>  all provided their own horsesand arms and although the former lacked the weight and bone ofenglish cavalry horses they were capable of performing long journeysand of existing on rations on which an english horse would starve</s> all were well armed for any deficiency had been made up from therajahs store and from this a large number of guns had three daysbefore been distributed among such of the ryots as intended to taketo the hills on the approach of the enemy</s>  ammunition had also beendistributed among them</s>  every man in the troop carried a shield andtulwar and on his back was slung a musket or spear and there werefew without pistols in their girdles</s> they rode halfway to conjeveram and stopped for the night at avillagethe men sleeping in the open air while the rajah his sonsand dick were entertained by the chief man of the place</s>  the nextafternoon they rode into conjeveram where just at sunset the boatsalso arrived</s> the troop encamped outside the town while the rajah and his partyoccupied some rooms that had been secured beforehand for them</s>  in themorning the ladies proceeded in a native carriage with the troop anofficer and ten men following in charge of the bullock cartscontaining the baggage</s> on reaching madras they encamped on the maidana large open spaceused as a drill ground for the troops garrisoned thereand the rajahand his party established themselves in the house occupied by him onthe occasion of his last visit</s>  the next day the rajah went to thegovernment house and had an interview with the deputy governor</s> i think the latter said after some conversation that your troopof cavalry will be of little use to the nabob</s>  if tippoo comes downfrom the hills he will not be able to take the field against him andwill need all his forces to defend arcot vellore and his smallerforts and cavalry would be of no real use to him</s>  your troop would beof much greater utility to the battalions from bengal when theyarrive</s>  they will be here in three weeks or so and as soon as theycome i will attach you to them</s>  i will write to the nabob sayingthat you were about to join him but that in the interest of thegeneral defence i have thought it better at present to attach youto the bengal contingent</s>  you see they will be entirely new to thecountry and it will be a great advantage to them to have a troop likeyours many of whom are well acquainted with the roads and generalgeography of the country</s>  your speaking english too will add to yourusefulness</s> i have a nephew with me who speaks english perfectly and alsohindustani the rajah said</s>  he is a smart young fellow and i haveno doubt that the officer in command would be able to make him veryuseful</s>  he is eager to be of service</s>  his father who was anenglishman was wrecked some years ago on the west coast and sent upa prisoner to mysore</s>  he was not one of those handed over at the timeof the peace but whether he has been murdered or is still a prisonerin tippoos hands we do not know</s>  my sister came out with the boythree or four months ago to endeavour to obtain some news of him</s> i will make a note of it rajah</s>  i have no doubt that he will be ofgreat use to colonel cockerell</s> in the last week in july the rajah moved with his troop toconjeveram and on the 1st of august the bengal forces arrived there</s> they were joined at once by three regiments of europeans one ofnative cavalry and a strong force of artillery raising their numbersto nine thousand five hundred men</s> colonel kelly took command of the force and begged the rajah toadvance with his horsemen at once to the foot of the ghauts tobreak it up into half troops and to capture or destroy any smallparties of horse tippoo might send down by any of the passes toreconnoitre the country and ascertain the movements and strength ofthe british forces</s>  he was also to endeavour to obtain as muchinformation as he could of what was going on in mysore and toascertain whether tippoo was still with his army watching generalmeadows in the west or was moving as if with the intention of takingadvantage of the main force of the english being away south todescend into the carnatic</s> the order was a very acceptable one to the rajah</s>  his troop made agood appearance enough when in company with those of the nabob ofarcot but he could not but feel that they looked a motley body by theside of the trained native and european troops and he was frequentlyangered by hearing the jeering comments of english soldiers to eachother when he rode past them with his troop and had not a littleastonished the speakers more than once by turning round on hishorse and abusing them hotly in their own language</s> he was therefore glad to be off</s>  for such work his men were farbetter fitted than were even the native cavalry in the companysservice</s>  they were stout active fellows accustomed to the hills andspeaking the dialect used by the shepherds and villagers among theghauts</s> proceeding northward through vellore he there divided his force intofour bodies</s>  he himself with fifty men took up a position at themouth of the pass of amboor</s>  another fifty were sent to the pass ofmoognee to the west of chittoor under the command of anwar thecaptain of the troop</s>  the rest were distributed among the minorpasses</s> dick remained with his uncle who established himself in a villageseven miles up the pass</s>  he was well satisfied with the arrangementfor he was anxious to learn to go about among the hills as a spy andwas much more likely to get leave from his uncle to do so than hewould have been from any of the officers of the troop who would nothave ventured to allow the rajahs nephew to run into danger</s> in the second place his especial friend among the officers a youthnamed surajah son of rajbullub was with the detachment</s>  surajah hadbeen especially picked out by the rajah as dicks companion</s>  hegenerally joined him in his rides and they had often gone on shootingexcursions among the hills</s>  he was about three years dicks seniorbut in point of height there was but little difference between them</s> every day half the troop under an officer rode up the pass untilwithin a mile of the fort near the summit garrisoned by mysoreantroops</s>
 they were able to obtain but little information for thevillages towards the upper end of the pass were all deserted and inruins the inhabitants never having ventured back since hydersinvasion</s> the rajah was vexed at being able to learn nothing of what was passingon the plateau and was therefore more disposed than he mightotherwise have been to listen to dicks proposal</s> dont you think uncle the latter said one evening that i mighttry to learn something by going up with surajah alone</s>  we could strikeoff into the hills as if on a shooting expedition just as we used todo from tripataly except that i should stain my face and hands</s>  thepeople in the villages on the top of the ghauts are every one sayssimple and quiet</s>  they have no love for tippoo or mysore but arecontent to pay their taxes and to work quietly in their fields</s>  therewill be little fear of our being interfered with by them</s> you might find a party of tippoos troops in one of the villagesdick and get into trouble</s> i dont see why we should uncle</s>  of course we should not go updressed as we are but as shikarees and when we went into a villageshould begin by asking whether the people are troubled with any tigersin the neighbourhood</s>  you see i specially came out here to go intomysore in disguise and i should be getting a little practice in thisway besides obtaining news for you</s> i am certainly anxious to get news dick</s>  so far i have had nothingto send down except that the reports from all the passes agree insaying that they have learned nothing of any movement on the part oftippoo and that no spies have come down the passes or any armedparty whatever</s>  this is good so far as it goes but it only showsthat the other passes are like this entirely deserted</s>  therefore wereally know nothing whatever</s>  even at this moment tippoo may havefifty thousand men gathered on the crest of the hills ready to pourdown tomorrow through one of the passes and therefore as i do notthink you would be running any great danger i consent to your goingwith surajah on a scouting expedition on foot among the hills</s>  asyou say you must of course disguise yourselves as peasants</s>  you hadbetter in addition to your guns each take a brace of pistols and soarmed even if any of the villagers were inclined to be hostile theywould not care about interfering with you</s> thank you uncle</s>  when would you expect us back if we start tomorrowmorning</s> that must be entirely in your hands dick</s>  you would hardly climb theghauts and light upon a village in one day and it might be necessaryto go farther before you could obtain any news</s>  it is a brokencountry with much jungle for some distance beyond the hills and thevillages lying off the roads will have but little communication witheach other and might know nothing whatever of what was happening inthe cultivated plains beyond</s>  at any rate you must not go into anyvillages on the roads leading to the heads of the passes for thereare forts everywhere and you would be certain to find parties oftroops stationed in them</s> even before war broke out i know that this was the case as theywere stationed there to prevent any captives native or europeanescaping from mysore</s>  you must therefore strictly avoid all the mainroads even though it may be necessary to proceed much farther beforeyou can get news</s>  i should think if we say three days going and asmany returning it will be as little as we can count upon and i shallnot begin to feel at all uneasy if you do not reappear for a week</s>  itis of no use your returning without some information as to what isgoing on in mysore and it would be folly to throw away your work andtrouble when in another day or two you might get the news you want</s> i shall therefore leave it entirely to your discretion</s> greatly pleased at having succeeded beyond his expectations dick atonce sought out surajah</s>  the latter was very gratified when he heardthat he was to accompany the young sahib on such an expedition and atonce set about the necessary preparations</s>  there was no difficulty inobtaining in the village the clothes required for their disguisesand one of the sheep intended for the following days rations waskilled and a leg boiled</s> if we take in addition to this ten pounds of flour a gourd ofghee and a little pan for frying the cakes in we shall be able toget on without having to buy food for four or five days and ofcourse when we are once among the villages we shall have nodifficulty in getting more</s>  you had better cut the meat off the boneand divide it in two portions and divide the flour too then we caneach carry our share</s> i will willingly carry it all sahib</s> not at all surajah</s>  we will each take our fair share</s>  you see weshall have a gun pistols ammunition and a tulwar and that withseven or eight pounds of food each and our water bottles will bequite enough to carry up the ghauts</s>  the only thing we want now issome stain</s> i will get something that will do and bring it with me in themorning sahib</s>  it wont take you a minute to put on</s>  i will come foryou at the first gleam of daylight</s> dick returned to the cottage he occupied with his uncle and told himwhat preparations they had made for their journey and they sattalking over the details for another hour</s>  the rajahs last words asthey lay down for the night weredont forget to take a blanket each</s>  you will want it for sleepingin the open which you will probably have to do several timesalthough you may occasionally be able to find shelter in a village</s> by the time the sun rose the next morning they were well upon theirway</s>  they had a good deal of toilsome climbing but by nightfall hadsurmounted the most difficult portions of the ascent and encampedwhen it became dark in a small wood</s>  here they lighted a fire cookedsome cakes of flour and with these and the cold meat made a heartymeal</s>  they had during the day halted twice and had breakfasted andlunched off some bread of which they had brought sufficient for thedays journey</s> i suppose there is no occasion to watch surajah</s> i dont know sahib</s>  i do not think it will be safe for us both tosleep</s>  there are as you know many tigers among these hills andthough they would not approach us as long as the fire is burningbrightly they might steal up and carry one of us off when the firegets low</s>  i will therefore watch</s> i certainly should not let you do that without taking my turn dicksaid and i feel so tired with the days work that i do not think icould keep awake for ten minutes</s>  it would be better to sleep in atree than that</s> you would not get much sleep in a tree sahib</s>  i have done it once ortwice when i have been hunting in a tigerinfested neighbourhood buti got scarcely any sleep and was so stiff in the morning that icould hardly walk</s>  i would rather sit up all night and keep up a goodfire than do that</s> dick thought for a minute or two and then got up and walked aboutunder the trees keeping his eyes fixed upon the branches overhead</s> this will do he said at last</s>  come here surajah</s>  there</s>  do yousee those two branches coming out in the same direction</s>  at onepoint they are but five or six feet apart</s>  we might fasten ourblankets side by side with the help of the straps of our waterbottles and the slings of the guns so as to make what are called onboard a ship hammocks and lie there perfectly safe and comfortable</s> surajah nodded</s> i have a coil of leather thong sahib</s>  i thought that it might beuseful if we wanted to bind a prisoner or for any other purpose soi stuffed it into my waist sash</s> that is good</s>  let us lose no time for i am quite ready for sleep</s>  iwill climb up first</s> in ten minutes the blankets were securely fastened side by sidebetween the branches</s>  surajah descended threw another armful of woodon to the fire placed their meat in the crutch of a bough six feetabove the ground and then climbed the tree again</s>  thus they weresoon lying side by side in their blankets</s>  these bagged ratherinconveniently under their weight but they were too tired to mindtrifles and were very soon fast asleep</s> dick did not wake until surajah called him</s>  it was already broaddaylight</s>  his companion had slipped down quietly stirred up theembers of the fire thrown on more wood and cooked some chupattiesbefore waking him</s> it is too bad surajah dick said as he looked down you ought tohave woke me</s>  i will unfasten these blankets before i get down</s>  itwill save time after breakfast</s> half an hour later they were again on their way and shortly cameupon a boy herding some goats</s>  he looked doubtfully at them butseeing that they were not mysorean soldiers he did not attempt tofly</s> how far is it to the next village lad</s>  surajah asked and which isthe way</s>  we are shikarees</s>  are there any tigers about</s> plenty of them the boy said</s>  i drive the goats to a strong highstockade every evening and would not come out before the sun rosefor all the money they say the sultan has</s> make for that tree and close to it you will see a spring</s>  followthat down</s>  it will take you to the village</s> after walking for six hours they came to the village</s>  it was a placeof some little size but there were few people about</s>  women came tothe doors to look at surajah and dick as they came along</s> where are you from</s>  an old man asked as he came out from hiscottage</s> from down the mountain side</s>  tigers are getting scarce there and wethought we would come over and see what we could do here</s> here there are many tigers the old man said</s>  for the last twentyyears the wars have taken most of our young men away</s>  some are forcedto go against their will for when the order comes to the head man ofthe village that the sultan requires so many soldiers he is forcedto pick out those best fitted for service</s>  others go of their own freewill thinking soldiering easier work than tilling the fields besidesthe chance of getting rich booty</s>  so there are but few shikarees andthe tigers multiply and are a curse to us</s> we are but poor people but if you choose to stay here for a time wewill pay something for every tiger you kill and we will send round tothe other villages within ten miles and doubtless every one of themwill contribute so that you might get enough to pay you for yourexertions</s> we will think of it surajah replied</s>  we did not intend to stop inone village but proposed to travel about in the junglecovereddistrict and wherever we hear complaints of a tiger committingdepredations we will stop and do our best to kill the evil beast</s>  wemean first to find out where they are most troublesome and then weshall work back again</s>  we hear that the sultan gives good prices forthose taken alive</s> i have heard so the old man said but none have been caught alivehere or by anyone in the villages round</s>  the sultan generally getsthem from the royal forests where none are allowed to shoot savewith his permission</s>  sometimes when there is a lack of them therehis hunters come into these districts and catch them in pitfalls andhave nets and ropes with which the tigers are bound and taken away</s> a little crowd had by this time collected round them and the womenwhen they heard that the strangers were shikarees who had come upwith the intention of killing tigers brought them bowls of milkcakes and other presents</s> i suppose now that the sultan is away at war dick said hishunters do not come here for tigers</s> we know nothing of his wars a woman said</s>  they take our sons fromus and we do not see them again</s>  we did hear a report that he hadgone with an army to conquer travancore</s>  but why he should want todo it none of us can make out</s>  his dominions are as wide as the heartof man can require</s>  it is strange that he cannot rest contented butlike his father should be always taking our sons away to fight</s> however these things are beyond the understanding of poor people likeus but we cant help thinking that it would be better if he were tosend his armies to destroy all the tigers</s>  if he would do that weshould not grudge the sums we have to pay when the tax gatherers comeround</s> after pausing for an hour in the village they continued on their way</s> two or three other small collections of huts were passed but it wasnot until the evening of the next day that they issued from thejunglecovered country onto the cultivated plain</s>  at none of theplaces they had passed was there anything known as to tippoo or hisarmy but they were told that there were parties of troops in all thevillages along the edge of the plain as well as in the passes</s> we must be careful now surajah dick said as after a long daysmarch they sat down to rest at a distance of half a mile from alarge village</s>  our tale that we are shikarees will not do here</s>  hadthat really been our object we should have stopped at the first placewe came to and at any rate we should not have come beyond thejungle</s>  we might still say that we are shikarees but that tigers hadbecome scarce on the other side of the hills and hearing a talk thattippoo and the english are going to war with each other we made upour minds to go to seringapatam and enlist in his army</s> that would do very well surajah agreed</s>  they would have no reasonfor doubting us and even if the officer here were to suggest that weshould enlist under him we could do so as there would be nodifficulty in slipping away and making off into the jungle again</s> they waited until the sun set and then walked on into the village</s> they had scarcely entered when two armed men stopped them andquestioned them whence they came</s> surajah repeated the story they had agreed upon and the men appearedquite satisfied</s> you will be just in time one said</s>  we have news that the sultanhas just moved with his army to seringapatam</s>  officers came hereonly yesterday to buy up cattle and grain</s>  these are to be retainedhere until orders are received where they are to be sent so i shouldsay that he is coming this way and will be going down the passes ashyder did</s> we shall be very glad for i suppose we shall join as he passesalong</s>  it has been dull work here and we are looking forward togaining our share of the loot</s>  it would be just as well for you tojoin us here now as to go on to seringapatam</s> it would save us a long tramp surajah agreed</s>  we will think itover and maybe we will have a talk with your officer tomorrowmorning</s> they sauntered along with the men talking as they went and soescaped being questioned by other soldiers</s>  presently they made theexcuse that they wanted to buy some flour and ghee before the shopswere closed and with a friendly nod to the two soldiers stoppedbefore the stall of a peasant who had on a little stand in front ofhim a large jar of ghee</s>  having purchased some they went a littlefarther and laid in a fresh supply of flour</s> things are very dear surajah remarked</s> there is very little left in the village the man said</s>  all theflour was bought up yesterday for the sultans army which they sayis coming in this direction and i have only got what you see here</s>  ithas been pounded by my wife and some other women since morning</s> that is good enough dick said as they walked away</s>  our work isdone surajah and it is not likely that we should learn anythingmore if we were to stop here for a week</s>  let us turn down betweenthese houses and make our way round behind</s>  we might be questionedagain by a fresh party of soldiers if we were to go along thestreet</s> they kept along on the outskirts of the village regained the road bywhich they had come and walked on until they reached the edge of thejungle</s>  going a short distance among the trees they collected somesticks lit a fire and sat down to cook their meal</s> at the last village or two they had heard but little of tigers andnow agreed that they could safely lie down and that it would not benecessary for them to rig up their blankets as hammocks as they haddone on the first two nights</s> chapter 6 a perilous adventure</s> they retraced their steps without adventure until they reached thevillage they had first stopped at</s> there are soldiers here surajah exclaimed as they entered</s> we cant help it now dick said</s>  there is nothing for it but togo on boldly</s>  i suppose that tippoo has sent troops into all thesefrontier villages to prevent any chance of news of his movementsbeing taken to the plains</s> ah</s>  there is the old chap who spoke to us last time</s>  let us stop atonce and talk with him</s> so you are back again the peasant said as they came up to him</s> yes surajah replied</s>  we told you we should come back here unlesswe got news of some tiger being marked down near one of the othervillages</s>  we have been as far as the edge of the jungle and althoughwe have heard of several not one of them seems to be in the habit ofcoming back regularly to the same spot so we thought we could not dobetter than return here at once and make it our headquarters</s> i see you have got some soldiers here</s> yes the old man said discontentedly and a rough lot they are</s> they demand food and instead of paying for it in money their officergives us bits of paper with some writing on them</s>  he says that whenthey go we are to take them to him and he will give us an orderequal to the whole of them for which we can receive money from thetreasury at seringapatam</s> a nice thing that</s>  none of us have ever been to seringapatam andshould not know what to do when we got there</s>  moreover there would beno saying whether one would ever come back again</s>  it is terrible</s> besides we have only grain enough for ourselves and shall have tosend down to the plains to buy more and where the money is to comefrom nobody can tell</s> i think i could tell you how you had better proceed if you will takeus into your house surajah said</s>  this is not a place for talking</s> there are four or five soldiers there watching us</s> the old man entered the house and closed the door behind them</s> how would you counsel us to proceed</s>  he asked as soon as they hadseated themselves on a divan formed of a low bank of beaten earthwith a thick covering of straw</s> it is simple enough surajah said</s>  one of you would take the orderon the sultans treasury to a large village down in the plain</s>  youwould go to a trader and say that you wished to purchase so muchgrain and other goods and would pay for them with an order on thesultans treasury</s>  it would probably be accepted as readily as cashfor the trader would send it to a merchant or banker at seringapatamto get it cashed for him to pay for goods he had obtained there andeither to send him any balance there might be or to retain it forfurther purchases</s>  an order of that kind is better than money fortrading purposes for there would be no fear of its being stolen onthe way as it could be hidden in the hair or shoe or anywhere amongthe clothes of the messenger</s> wonderful</s>  the old peasant said</s>  your words are a relief indeedto me and will be to all the village when they hear them</s> and now dick broke in let us talk about tigers</s>  while you havebeen speaking those soldiers have passed the door twice and havebeen looking suspiciously at the house</s>  if they take it into theirheads to come here and to ask who we are and what is our business itwould not do to tell them that we have been discussing the value ofthe orders on the sultans treasury</s> now if our advice has been of any assistance to you in this matteryou in turn can render us aid in our business of killing tigers</s>  wewant you to find out for us when a tiger was last seen near thevillage where its lair is supposed to be and whether according toits situation we should have the best chance of killing it by digginga pitfall on the path by which it usually comes from the jungle orby getting a kid and tying it up to attract the tiger to a spot wherewe shall be stationed in a tree</s> i will assuredly do that and every one here will be glad to assistwhen i tell them the advice i have received from youand wouldindeed do so in any case for it will be a blessing to the villageif you can kill the tiger that so often carries off some of our sheepand goats</s> at this moment there was a loud knocking at the door</s>  on the peasantopening it a group of soldiers demanded to see the men who hadentered</s> we are here surajah said coming forward</s>  what do you want</s> we want to know who you are and where you come from</s> any one in the village could have told you that surajah said</s>  weare shikarees and have come here to destroy tigers</s>  we werearranging with this old man to find us guides who can point out thetracks of the one which has for some time been preying on theiranimals</s> yes and our children the old man put in for three of them werecarried off from the street here within the last month</s> the soldiers looked doubtful but one of them saidthis is for our officer to inquire about</s>  the men are strangers tothe village and he will want to question them</s> we are quite ready to be questioned surajah said</s>  our host herewill bear me out in what i say and there are others in the villagewho will tell you that we have been arranging with them to killtigers in this neighbourhood though as yet we have not settled whatthey will pay us for each beast we destroy</s> accompanied by the peasant they went with the soldiers to the guardhouse with which each of the frontier villages was provided</s>  itconsisted of a group of huts surrounded by a thick wall of sunburntbricks</s>  they were taken into the largest hut where the officer of theparty was seated on a rough divan</s> who have you here</s>  he asked irritably for he had been awakened froma doze by their entry</s> they are two young fellows who are strangers here</s>  they say they areshikarees who have come into the village to gain a reward for killinga tiger that has been troublesome</s> they were here three days ago sahib the villager said and askedus many questions about the tigers and were when the soldiers cameto the door questioning me as to the tigers place of retreat andwhether a pitfall or a kid as a decoy would be most suitable</s> where do you come from</s>  the officer asked surajah</s> we live in a little village some distance down the ghauts</s>  we heardthat tigers were more abundant in the jungle country up here thanthey are below and thought that we would for a time follow ourcalling here</s>  we can get good prices for the skins down below andwith that and what we get from the villages for freeing them from thetigers we hope in a few months to take back a good store of money</s> your story is a doubtful one the officer said harshly</s>  you may bewhat you say and you may be spies</s> if we had been spies surajah said we should not be here but atbangalore or seringapatam</s>  these villages are not the places wherenews is to be gained</s> this was so self evident that the officer had nothing to say againstit</s> at any rate he said after a pause there is no confirmation toyour story and as i have orders to put all suspicious persons underarrest i shall detain you</s> it is very hard surajah began but the officer made an impatientgesture while two of the soldiers put their hands on the shoulders ofthe prisoners and led them from the hut</s> you need not look so downcast one of them said good naturedly</s>  idont suppose you will be kept here long and will no doubt bereleased when the sultan has gone down the passes with his army</s>  aweek or two here will do you no harmthe tigers can wait for a bit</s> there give us your weapons</s>  i daresay you will get them back againwhen we go on as i hope we shall do for there is nothing to eat andnothing to do in this miserable place</s> the arms were taken into the officers hut and as there was a sentryat the gate no further attention was paid to them</s> i will get you some provisions and bring them in the old man said</s> it is hard indeed that men cannot go about their business withoutbeing interfered with</s> thank you but we have enough for two or three days</s>  when that isgone we will give you some money to buy more for we have a fewrupees with us as we knew it might be some time before we should beable to kill a tiger</s> as soon as the old man had left them they seated themselves on alarge faggot of wood that had been brought in by the villagers forfuel</s> we cannot stay here surajah</s>  it is most important that we should getback with the news and i have no doubt that pigheaded brute in therewill do as he says and will hold us prisoners until tippoo has gonedown the passes</s>  we must get off tonight if possible</s>  we are notlikely to be looked after very sharply</s>  i dont think that fellowreally suspects us but is simply keeping us to show his authority</s> there ought to be no difficulty in getting out</s>  i suppose we shall beput into one of the soldiers huts tonight and if we crawl out whenthey are asleep we have only to make our way up those narrow steps tothe top of the wall and then let ourselves down the other side</s>  it isnot above fifteen feet high and even if we dropped we should not belikely to hurt ourselves</s> there will most likely be a sentry at the gate surajah observedand there is a moon tonight</s> there ought to be no difficulty in pouncing on him suddenly gagginghim before he can give the alarm and then tying him</s>  we will walkround and see if there is any rope lying about</s>  if not i will tear mysash into strips</s>  we can use yours to lower ourselves over the wall</s>  ishould like to get our weapons if we could</s>  the guns do not matterbut the pistols are good ones</s>  and if there is an alarm given we mayhave to fight</s>  besides it is not impossible that we may come across atiger as we go along</s>  i vote that when we have secured the sentrywe pay the officer a visit</s> surajah nodded</s>  he was quite ready to agree to anything that dickmight suggest and felt a strong desire to repossess himself of hisarms for it seemed to him that it would be a humiliation to go backwithout them</s> of course dick went on if the sentry gives the alarm before wecan secure him we must give up part of our plan for in that casewe should have to bolt</s>  once over the wall we should be all right</s> they may fire away at us as we run but there is no fear of theirhitting us half asleep as they will be and not quite sure what it isall about</s>  if we get a fair start of them we need not have much fearof their catching us</s> not as long as it is straight running sahib but if they follow usfar they may come up within range of us as we are making our way downsome of those nasty places where we came up the face of the ghaut</s> if we once get well away from them we will hide up somewhere andthen strike off on another line</s> we might do that surajah agreed but you know the place where wecame up was the only one that seemed to us climbable and it would becertainly better to make for it again if we can find our way</s> i quite agree with you there surajah</s>  it would never do to go andfind ourselves on the edge of a precipice that we could not get downwith the soldiers anywhere near us</s>  besides it is of the greatestimportance that we should take the news back as soon as possible asevery hour may be of importance</s>  i only wish we could find out whichpass tippoo means to go by but i dont suppose that will be knownuntil he starts for it</s>  anyhow our news will be very valuable for atpresent he is supposed to be over on the other side and he would havetaken our troops entirely by surprise if he had suddenly poured outonto the plain</s>  so we must give up my idea of hiding up for if we didso we should have to lie there all day and it would mean the loss oftwentyfour hours for i would not go down those ghauts for any moneyexcept in daylight</s>  it is a very different thing going downhill togoing up and if we were to attempt it in the dark we should breakour necks for a certainty</s>  if we can get away early tonight we shallbe at the edge of that steep place by nine oclock in the morning andif we strike the right point we might be back to the rajah bynightfall</s> it will be difficult to find our way back in the dark surajah said</s> no doubt</s>  still we can keep in the general direction and even if wedo not hit upon the stream tonight we shall find it in the morning</s> it was late in the afternoon when they reached the village and it wasnow growing dark</s>  two soldiers came up to them and bade them followthem into one of the huts and there pointed to the farther corner astheir place</s>  they wrapped themselves in their blankets and at oncelay down</s> if they take it into their heads dick whispered to surajah to puta sentry on guard at the door it will upset all our plans</s>  it wouldnot be very difficult to cut our way through the mud wall behind usbut in the first place they have taken away our knives and even ifwe had them it would be risky work trying it</s> the chances are that they will sit and talk all night</s>  of course wemight surprise the sentry but it would be a great risk with thosefellows close at hand and we should have to run straight for thesteps and might get a dozen balls after us before we were over thewall</s> i dont think there would be much chance of their hitting ussurajah said</s>  jumping up from their sleep in confusion they would bea minute or so before they could find out what had happened and weshould be at the foot of the steps before they saw us and then theywould fire almost at random</s> but in that case we should lose our weapons he added regretfully</s> we cannot help that</s>  the arms are of no consequence at all comparedto our getting awayunless of course any of them happen to overtakeus</s> for three or four hours the soldiers of whom there were ten in thehut sat eating talking and smoking round the fire which they keptburning on the earthen floor</s>  one by one however they left it andlay down</s>  when but three remained one of them got up with a grumbleof discontent took his musket which was leaning against the walland went out of the hut</s> what a nuisance</s>  dick whispered</s>  he is evidently going on sentryduty</s> perhaps he has gone to the gate</s>  surajah suggested</s> i am afraid not</s>  i expect the other hut is furnishing the sentrythere</s>  listen</s> during the pauses of the low conversation of the two men still sittingby the fire they could hear a footfall outside</s> that settles the question dick said</s>  now the sooner those fellowsgo to sleep the better</s> we had better wait for some time after they do surajah replied</s> one or two of the men who lay down first are sure to get up and goto the door and look out</s>  they always do that once or twice duringthe night</s>  the sentry will soon get accustomed to the door beingopened and wont look round sharp</s> that is a good idea dick agreed</s>  the moon is at the back of thehut so we shall be in the shadow</s>  i will spring upon him and willtry and grip him by the throat so that he cant holloa</s>  you wrenchthe musket from his hands and snatch his belt of cartridges</s>  thatwill give us a weapon anyhow</s>  as soon as you have got it i will givehim one sharp squeeze and throw him down</s>  it will be some time beforehe gets breath enough to holloa</s> in half an hour the two men by the fire lay down</s>  it was not longbefore as surajah predicted one of the sleepers sat up and stretchedhimself then he rose and walked to the door opened it and stood atthe entrance a moment later he was joined by another figure and fora few minutes they stood talking together</s>  then he came in againshut the door and lay down</s> during the next hour three of the others followed his example thelast of them leaving the door ajar behind him when he came in</s> now is our chance surajah</s>  we must give him ten minutes to fallasleep again</s>  then we will move</s>  should one of them be lying awakeand notice uswhich is not likely for it is too dark in here to seefigures distinctlyand ask where we are going say to the door toget cool</s>  they wont imagine that we are thinking of escape with onesentry at the door and another at the gate</s> dont you think sahib that it would be safer to kill the sentries</s> safer or not surajah we will not do it</s>  at present they have doneus no harm</s>  they are only acting as their officer ordered and we haveno grudge against them</s>  when they take to shooting at us we mustshoot at them but to kill this sentry would be nothing short ofmurder</s> after waiting a few minutes longer dick saidwe had better be off now</s>  if we were to wait longer we should haveanother fellow getting up</s> they rose quietly to their feet made their way to the door andopened it noiselessly</s>  the sentry was standing leaning on his longmatchlock a few feet away</s>  suddenly a voice behind exclaimed who isthat</s> the sentry was in the act of turning round when dick sprang upon himand grasped him by the throat</s>  no cry came from the mans lips butthe gun fell from his grasp as he clutched convulsively at dickswrists and went off as it fell</s> pick it up dick shouted and run</s> he released his grip from the mans throat snatched the bandolierfrom his shoulder and tripping his feet from under him threw himheavily to the ground and then turned to run</s> the whole had occupied but a few seconds but as he started a soldierran out from the hut shouting loudly</s>  he had a gun in his hand</s>  dickchanged his mind turned threw himself upon him wrenched the gunfrom his hold and as the man staggered back struck him with hisright hand under the chin</s> the man fell back through the open door as if shot</s>  dick seized thehandle and closed it and then ran at full speed towards the foot ofthe steps</s>  they were but some twenty yards away</s> up you go surajah</s>  we have not a moment to lose</s> dick sprang up the steps surajah following</s>  as they reached the topof the wall a shot was discharged at them by the sentry at the gatewho ignorant of the cause of the sudden uproar had been standing inreadiness to fire</s>  he was however too excited to take aim and thebullet flew harmlessly over their heads</s>  in another instant theysprang over the parapet</s> lower yourself by your arms and then drop</s> the wall like many others of its sort was thicker at the base thanon the top and the foot projected two feet beyond the upper line sothat it was a sharp slide rather than an absolute fall</s>  it was wellthat it was so for although only some twelve feet high inside it waseight feet higher on its outer face as a dry ditch encircled it</s>  bothcame down in a heap on the sand that had crumbled from the face of thewall</s> as soon as they picked themselves up dick exclaimed keep along thefoot of the wall surajah and they dashed along until they reachedthe angle</s>  as they turned the corner they heard a burst of voicesfrom the wall where they had slid down and several shots were fired</s> dick led the way along the ditch to the next angle then left it andentered the village and dashed along the street</s> the sound of firing had roused many of the peasants</s>  doors wereopening and men coming out</s>  exclamations of surprise were heard asthe two figures rushed past but no one thought of interfering withthem</s>  as they left the houses behind them surajah saidyou are going the wrong way sahib</s>  you are going right away from theghauts</s> i know that well enough dick panted but i did it on purpose</s>  wewill turn and work round again</s>  they will hear from the villagersthat we have come this way and will be following us down the roadwhile we are making our way back to the ghauts</s> they ran for another hundred yards then quitted the path and madeacross the fields</s>  from the fort and village they could hear a greathubbub and above it could make out the voice of the officer shoutingorders</s>  they continued to run for another quarter of a mile and thenturned</s> now we can go quietly dick said breaking into a walk</s>  this linewill take us clear of the fort and village and we have only to makestraight for the ghauts</s>  i think we have thrown them well off thescent and unless the officer suspects that we have only gone theother way to deceive him and that we are really making for theghauts we shall hear nothing more of them</s> it is capital surajah said</s>  i could not think what you were doingwhen you turned round the corner of the fort and made for the villageinstead of going the other way</s>  but where did you get that gun from</s> dick told him how it had come into his possession</s> it was not so much that i cared for the gun he said as that iwanted to prevent the man from using it</s>  if he had followed meclosely he could hardly have helped hitting one of us as we went upthe steps</s>  by shutting the door we gained a few moments for theywere all in confusion in the dim light inside and would certainly notlearn anything either from the man i pitched in among them or fromthe sentry outside</s> i dont suppose any of them had an idea of what had happened untilthe sentry shouted to them that we had got over the wall</s>  then theyrushed up and fired at random from the top thinking that we shouldbe running straight from it</s> they walked along for a short distance and then dick saidi have got my wind again now</s>  we will go on at a jog trot</s>  imistrust that officer</s>  he had a crafty face and as we said webelonged to a village down the ghauts he may have a suspicion that wehave been trying to throw him off our scent and think we should besure to double back and make for home</s> they kept on their way sometimes dropping into a walk but generallygoing at an easy trot until day broke</s> as soon as it gets a little lighter surajah we will go up on to oneof these rises so as to have a good look down over the line we havecome</s>  if they are following us we must go on at the top of our speed</s> if we see nothing of them we can take it quietly</s>  of course theycant have been following our steps but it is quite likely that someof the villagers may know that the ghauts can be climbed at the pointwhere we came up</s>  you know we noticed signs of a path two or threetimes on the way up</s>  in that case if the officer really did think ofpursuing us he would take one of the villagers as guide</s> half an hour later they ascended a sharp rise and threw themselvesdown on its crest</s> i dont think that there is the least chance of their comingsurajah said carelessly</s>  when they had gone some distance withoutovertaking us on the road they may possibly have suspected that wehad turned and made this way but by the time they got back to thevillage they would know well enough that there was no chance ofovertaking us</s> dick made no answer</s>  he had a sort of uneasy conviction that theofficer would at once suspect their plan and that pursuit would havecommenced very shortly after they had repassed the fort</s>  for someminutes no words were spoken</s>  no sign of life was to be seen but inso broken a country covered in many places with jungle or wood aconsiderable body of men might be coming up unperceived</s> suddenly dick grasped surajahs arm</s> there they are</s>  you see that i was right</s>  look at that clump of bushhalf a mile away well to the left of the line we came by</s>  they havejust come out from there</s>  there are ten or twelve of them</s> i see them surajah said</s>  they are running too but not veryfast</s> we will crawl back till we are out of their sight and then make arun for it</s>  they must have got a guide and are no doubt taking amore direct line than we are for we may be a good bit off the streamwe followed as we came along</s>  i have not seen anything i recognisesince it got light though i am sure we have been going somewhere nearthe right direction</s>  now we have got to run for it</s> they dashed off at a rate of speed much higher than that at whichthey had before been travelling keeping as much as possible inground covered from the sight of their pursuers and bearing somewhatto the left so as to place the latter directly behind them and tostrike the path dick had no doubt their pursuers were keeping</s> it is no use running too fast he said a few minutes later</s>  thereis a good long way to go yetanother ten miles i should think andanyhow i dont think we can get down that steep place before theycome to the edge of the cliff above</s>  you see we are not certain as towhere it is</s>  we might strike the cliffs a mile or two on either sideof it and i have no doubt they will go straight to the spot</s>  i expectthe man they have got as a guide has been in the habit of going downthe ghauts and knows his way</s> if it were not that we are in such a hurry to get to uncle with thenews about tippoo it would be much better to turn off altogetherand stay in a wood for a day or two</s>  they would not stop very long atthe top of the ghauts for they cannot be sure that we are going thatway at all and when a few hours passed and we didnt come theofficer would suppose that he was mistaken and that we really kept onin the line on which we started</s> they trotted along for some time in silence and then surajah saiddo you not think that it would be better for us to make for the passto the left</s>  it is twenty miles off but we should be there by theevening and we should surely find some way of getting into it belowwhere the fort stands</s> dick stopped running</s> why not go the other way and make for the pass we know</s>  he said</s> it cant be more than fifteen miles at the outside and once belowthe fort we know our way and should get down to the village twelvehours sooner than if we went round by the other pass</s> it would be the right plan if we could do it surajah agreed butyou know the rocks rise straight up on both sides of the fort and theroad passes up through a narrow cleft with the fort standing at itsmouth</s>  that is why i proposed the other pass</s> i think we had better try it nevertheless surajah</s>  we should not bemore than three hours in going straight there and shall have ampletime to follow the edge of the precipice for the last five miles</s>  wemay discover some break where we can get down</s>  if we should find itimpossible to descend anywhere we must sleep till sunset then strikethe road above the fort go down at night and manage to slip past thesentry</s> the only thing is sahib that it seemed as if the fort lay rightacross the entrance to the gorge and the road went through it</s> it did look like that surajah</s>  certainly the road went through agateway</s>  but there must be a break somewhere</s>  we could see that inthe wet season a lot of water comes down there so there must be somesort of passage for it and if the passage is big enough for the stormwater to go through it must be big enough for us</s> surajah agreed and they turned off from the line that they had beforebeen following no longer hurrying but walking at a leisurely pace</s> they were not pressed for time</s>  there was no chance whatever ofpursuit and as they had been going for some six hours at the top oftheir speed they were both feeling exhausted</s> after proceeding for two miles they came upon a small stream</s>  herethey sat down lighted a fire mixed some flour and waterforalthough the ghee had been taken from them when they were disarmedthey had been allowed to retain their supply of flour for theirsustenance in prisonand made some small cakes</s>  these they cooked inthe glowing embers</s>  they could not be termed a success for theoutside was burned black while the centre was a pasty mass</s>  howeverthey sufficed to satisfy their hunger and after an hours rest theyagain went forward</s> it was not very long before they stood on the edge of the rock wall</s> they followed this along but could nowhere find a spot where adescent seemed at all possible</s>  after walking for an hour they saw aroad winding up a long valley below them</s> that is our road dick exclaimed</s>  that clump of houses surajahmust be the one where we generally turned</s>  i know that from belowthese rocks looked as steep as walls so there is no chance of ourfinding a way down anywhere between this and the fort</s> surajah nodded</s>  to him also the ascent of the ghauts had seemedimpracticable</s> it is no use following this line any more dick went on</s>  we may aswell strike across until we come onto the edge of the pass somewhereabove the fort find a place where we can descend easily and then liedown and sleep till it is time to make our attempt</s> in another hour they were looking down on the road a mile or soabove the fort</s>  the slopes here were gradual and could be descendedwithout the least difficulty even in the dark</s> there</s>  do you see surajah</s>  the water course runs along by the sideof the road</s>  there is a little water in it now</s>  you know we used tomeet with it down below and water our horses at a pool close to thatruined village</s>  when we start we can follow the road until we getclose to the fort and then crawl along in the water course and takeour chances</s>  if we should find it so blocked up that we cant getthrough we must then see how we can get past the place in some otherway</s>  if the gate is only barred no doubt we should be able tooverpower the sentry and get the gate open before any alarm is given</s> if it is locked we must do the best we can</s>  we may calculate upontaking the sentry by surprise as we did in the prison and onsilencing him at once then we should have time to break up somecartridges and pour the powder into the keyhole which is sure to bea big one make a slow match and blow the lock open</s>  we could makethe slow match before we start if we had some water</s> shall i go down to the stream and get some</s> you have nothing to carry it up in surajah and besides someonemight come along the valley</s> we shall only want a little water</s>  i will take off my sash and dipit in the stream that will give us plenty when it is wrung out</s> at any rate surajah we will do nothing until it is getting dusk</s> see</s>  there are some peasants with three bullocks coming down thevalley and there are four armed horsemen riding behind them</s>  we willgo back to those bushes a hundred yards behind us and sleep thereuntil sunset then we will make our way down to that heap of bouldersclose to the stream manufacture our slow match and hide up thereuntil it is time to start</s>  we want a rest badly</s>  we did not sleeplast night and if we get through we must push on tonight without astop so we must have a good sleep now</s>
 they watched it dip below the hillsand then after waiting until it began to get dusk started for thevalley</s>  no one was to be seen on the road and they ran rapidly downthe slope until they reached the heap of boulders</s>  surajah tore off astrip of cotton six inches long by an inch wide from the bottom ofhis dress went forward to the stream and wetted it</s>  when he cameback they squeezed the moisture from it broke up a cartridge rubbedthe powder into the cotton and then rolled it up longways</s> that will be dry enough by the time we want to start dick said</s>  ihope we shant have to use it but if there is no other way we mustdo so</s> they remained where they were until they thought that the garrison ofthe fort would be for the most part asleep</s>  then they crossed thestream and walked along by the side of the road taking care not toshow themselves upon it as their figures would be seen for a longdistance on its white dusty surface</s>  presently the sides of thevalley approached more closely to each other and just where theynarrowed they could make out a number of dark objects which werethey doubted not the houses occupied by the garrison</s>  they at oncetook to the bed of the stream stooping low as they went so thattheir bodies would be indistinguishable among the rocks</s> they could hear the murmur of voices as they passed through thevillage</s>  once beyond it they entered the gorge</s>  here there was butroom enough for the road and the stream whose bed was several feetbelow the causeway</s>  a few hundred yards farther the gorge widened outa bit and in the moonlight they could see the wall of the fortstretching before them and a square building standing close to it</s> that is the guard house no doubt dick said in low tones</s>  it istoo close to be pleasant if we have to attack the sentry</s> very carefully they picked their way among the rocks until close tothe wall then dick gave a low exclamation of disappointment</s>  thestream ran through a culvert some twelve feet wide and ten feet highbut this was closed by iron bars crossing each other at intervals ofonly five or six inches the lower ends of the perpendicular barsbeing fixed in a stone dam extending across the bed of the stream</s> dick waded across the pool formed by the dam and felt the bars butfound them perfectly solid and strong</s> it is no good surajah he said when he returned</s>  there is nogetting through there</s>  there is nothing for it but the gate unless wecan find the steps up to the top of the wall and get up unnoticed</s> then we might tear up our sashes longways knot them together andslip down</s> the first thing to do is to have a look round</s>  i will get up close tothe wall</s>  it is in shadow there</s> entering the pool again he climbed up the steep bank which was herefaced with stones</s>  he stopped when his eyes were above the level andlooked round</s>  there was the gate twelve feet away and to his delightno sentry was to be seen</s>  he was about to whisper surajah to join himwhen he heard voices</s>  they came from above and he at once understoodthat instead of a man being posted behind the gate two were on guardon the wall above it</s>  he beckoned to surajah to join him and when hedid so whispered what he had discovered</s> if the gate is only barred we are all right now surajah exceptthat we shall have to run the risk of being shot by those fellows onthe wall</s>  we shall be a pretty easy mark on that white road bymoonlight</s>  our only plan will be to keep close to the wall when weare through the gate get down into the bed of the stream again andthen crawl along among the rocks</s>  the bottom will be in shadow and wemay get off without being noticed</s>  the only fear is that we shall makea noise in opening the gate</s> now let us try it</s> keeping close to the wall they crept to the gateway</s>  this projectedtwo feet beyond the gate itself and standing against the latter theycould not be seen even in the unlikely event of one of the sentrieslooking down</s>  the only risk was of anyone in the guard house comingout</s>  this however could not be avoided and they at once began toexamine the fastenings of the gate which consisted of two massivebars of wood running across it</s>  these by their united strength theyremoved one after another</s>  but when they tried it they found the gatestill immovable</s> the beastly thing is locked dick said</s>  there is nothing to do butto blow it open</s> he broke off the ends of three cartridges poured the powder in at thekeyhole and then inserted the slow match</s> stand in the corner there surajah</s>  i will go down to the streamagain to light the tinder</s>  the noise is less likely to be heardthere</s> he stole back again sat down at the edge of the water placed histinder box in his lap took his turban off and put it over his handsso as to deaden the sound and then struck the steel sharply againstthe flint</s>  the first blow was successful</s>  the spark fell on thetinder and at once began to extend</s> he listened intently</s>  the men on the wall were still talking and thesound had evidently not reached their ears</s> chapter 7 besieged</s> dick hastily clambered up the wall ran to the gate blew the tinderand then applied it to the slow match</s>  a moment later this began tofizz</s> round the corner of the wall surajah</s>  he exclaimed running backhimself</s> a few anxious seconds passed then came a sharp explosion</s>  in aninstant they ran up</s>  the gate stood two or three inches open</s>  ityielded to a push and they ran out</s> loud shouts were heard from the men above and a hubbub of cries fromthe guard house</s> run surajah</s>  we must risk it</s>  keep on the edge of the road anddodge as you go</s>  the chances are they will run down below to see whathas happened</s> at the top of their speed they dashed down the road</s>  no shot wasfired from the wall dicks conjecture that the first impulse of thesentries would be to run down below having been justified</s>  they were acouple of hundred yards away before two shots were fired from thegate</s>  the bullets whistled by harmlessly</s> we are all right now dick cried</s>  they can scarcely see us and weshall soon be out of sight altogether</s> five or six more shots were fired a few seconds later as the men fromthe guard house reached the gate</s>  on looking back when they had goneanother hundred yards they saw a number of figures on the road</s> not quite so fast surajah dick said</s>  it is going to be a longchase now</s>  we have got three hundred yards start and they wont beable to load again running at full speed</s> for a time their pursuers gained somewhat upon them then graduallythey began to straggle as the effect of the speed at which they wererunning told upon them</s>  when they reached the ruined village therewere four men running together some three hundred yards behind</s>  therest were a considerable distance in the rear</s> another mile or two and they will all give up the chase except thesefour surajah and if they turn out better runners than we do we canmake a stand</s>  there are some more huts another two miles farther andwe will fight them there</s> they were going slower now for although the downward course of theroad helped them a good deal the run was telling on them</s>  not a wordwas spoken until they reached the second village</s>  when they came tothe first house they stopped simultaneously and looked round</s>  theirpursuers were not more than two hundred yards behind them</s> in here surajah dick said as he ran into the ruined hut</s> its roof was gone its door hung loose on its hinges</s>  it had but onewindow a small one looking up the valley</s>  dick laid his gun on thesill which was nearly level with his shoulder</s> i must wait until they get pretty close he said for i am pantingso that i cant keep the barrel steady even with this rest</s> i will kneel down outside surajah said</s> mind i will fire first surajah</s>  dont you fire until they arewithin twenty yards of you</s>  by that time i shall have loaded again</s> dick had more time than he had expected for as soon as their pursuerssaw them enter the hut they slackened their pace considerably</s>  theywere within about eighty yards when dick held his breath andstanding for a moment immovable took a steady aim and fired</s> one of the men stumbled in his run took a step or two forward andthen fell on his face</s>  the others paused for a moment and then witha fierce yell ran forward</s> the moment he had fired dick dropped the stock of his gun on to theground snatched a cartridge from the bandolier bit off the end andemptied the powder into the barrel gave the gun a shake so as to besure that it ran into the touch hole and then rammed down the bullet</s> as he was in the act of doing so surajah fired and a loud yell toldthat his shot had been successful</s> dick sprang to the door as surajah entered</s>  two shots at the sameinstant rang out but at even so short a distance the bullets wentwide</s>  dick stepped out and in turn fired</s>  one of the two men fellthe other threw down his musket and fled up the road</s> thank goodness that is over dick exclaimed</s>  i thought they had nochance with us here</s>  now the first thing is to get our wind again</s> they stood for two or three minutes breathing heavily then as theirbreath came again they prepared to move when dick exclaimedsuddenly what is that noise</s> there was a dull confused sound in the air and then surajahpointing up the road exclaimed cavalry</s> far away on the white road a dark mass could be seen</s>  at first dickinstinctively turned to resume their flight but then he saidit is of no use surajah</s>  the sides of the valley are too steep toclimb and they will be up in five or six minutes</s>  we must fight itout here</s>  run out to that man i shot and bring in his gun bandolierpistols if he has any and sword</s>  i will take them from these two</s>  itwill make all the difference having spare weapons</s> surajah without a word hurried up the road while dick ran over tothe house opposite which seemed to be larger than the one they hadfirst entered</s>  he looked round</s>  it contained only one room but thiswas twenty feet square</s>  there were three small windows one lookinginto the street one looking up the valley and one behind</s>  the floorwas littered with the beams of the roof</s>  the door was still in itsplace</s>  having ascertained this he ran back to the bodies of the twomen picked up the three guns took off their bandoliers and removedthe pistols from their sashes and with these and one of theirswords returned to the house just as surajah came back</s> this is the best house to defend surajah</s>  there are some beams withwhich we can block up the door</s> laying down the arms inside they set to work with the beams andbarricaded the door so firmly that short of its being splintered topieces no entry could be effected</s>  this done they recharged the sixguns examined the pistols and finding that they were loaded placedthree of them in each of their sashes and hung the swords by theirsides</s>  then they went to the window looking up the valley</s>  thehorsemen some twenty in number were but a short quarter of a mileaway and were coming along at a gallop</s> dont fire surajah dick said</s>  they will have heard from the manwho has got away that we are in the house opposite and if they dontfind us there they will think that we have gone on and will ridedown the valley till they are sure they must be ahead of us</s>  then theywill search the ground carefully as they come back and altogether wemay gain an hour and every moment is of use</s>  it must be two oclocknow and our troop generally gets here soon after seven</s> as he spoke the horsemen drew up in front of the opposite hut</s>  therewas a momentary pause and then a voice saidit is empty</s> then followed the commandride on men</s>  they cant have got very far</s>  we shall overtake them inten minutes</s> as soon as they started dick saidtake a ramrod surajah and make some holes through the walls tofire through</s>  if we were to show ourselves at the windows we mightget shot</s> the walls were built of mud and clay and with the iron ramrods theyhad no difficulty in making four holes an inch wide and two incheshigh on each side of the house</s> now we are ready for them dick said when they had finished</s>  theyhave been gone half an hour and it wont be long before they areback</s> in a few minutes they heard the clatter of horses hoofs</s>  it ceasedsome forty or fifty yards away and by the sound of voices and ordersit was evident that the other houses were being searched</s>  voices werealso heard at the back of the house and they guessed that the groundwas being closely examined up to the foot of the rock walls whichenclosed the valley</s> now surajah you can take a shot from the window of that side</s>  theothers will be here in a minute and it is just as well to let themknow where we are before they get close up to our door</s> surajah went to the window at the back</s>  four horsemen were makingtheir way at a walk along the level ground between the rocks and thehuts</s>  the nearest was but some forty yards away</s>  surajah fired andthe man at once fell from his horse</s>  the others instantly galloped onat full speed up the valley and from the window at the end surajahsaw them gather on the road three or four hundred yards away andthen after a short consultation cross to the other side of thevalley with the intention he had no doubt of rejoining theircomrades</s> the sound of the gun had been followed by shouts and exclamations fromthe party in the village</s>  dick could hear a conference in low tonesthen all was silent</s>  he went to the loophole at the corner laid hisrifle in it and waited looking along the barrel</s>  two or threeminutes later the hole was darkened and he fired at once</s>  there was asound of a heavy fall followed by cries of rage and a moment laterthere was a rush of men against the door</s> surajah ran across</s>  two spare guns were pushed through the loopholesone on each side of it</s>  these had not been bored straight through thewall but at angles that would enable them to fire at anyone attackingit</s>  looking along the barrels each could see one of the group infront and fired at the same moment</s>  with a yell of rage and surprisethe assailants of the door sprang back and ran down the street</s> there are four less anyhow dick said as he and surajah reloadedthe empty guns</s>  those loopholes will puzzle them and i dont thinkthey will care to come on again for a bit</s> there was a pause for some minutes and then from the huts oppositeand from various points higher up the valley and behind a droppingfire was opened</s> keep out of the line of the windows whatever you do surajah and itwill be just as well to lie down for a bit until we see whether anyof their shots come through the wall</s>  i think we are quite safe fromthe distant fire but from the house opposite it is possible they maypenetrate it</s>  anyhow dont stand in the line of a loophole</s>  a strayball might find its way in</s> for a few minutes the enemy fired away unanswered and then dick whohad been seated on the ground with his back against the end wall gotup and went along that facing the street carefully examining it</s> i dont think any of their balls have come through surajah</s>  i shouldbe able to see out into the moonlight if they had done so</s>  now it istime for us to be doing something</s>  i expect they are getting a littlebolder and will perhaps give us a chance</s> you take this loophole</s>  it is exactly in a line with the oppositehut and the fellows in there must come to their door to fire</s>  i willtake this slanting hole by the doorpost</s>  i can see one of the windowsof the next hut to that we were in</s>  i have no doubt that they arefiring from there also</s>  dont wait for them to shoot but firedirectly a figure shows itself</s> in a very short time surajah fired</s>  dick heard the clatter of a gunas it fell to the ground</s> you have hit him surajah</s> yes but only wounded him</s>  i think i hit him on the shoulder</s>  he lethis gun drop and ran into the house</s> take a spare gun at once</s>  if there are others there they will thinkthat you are loading and may show themselves again</s> a moment later dick saw a gun thrust out through the window he waswatching</s>  then the head and shoulders of a man appeared behind it</s>  hefired and the figure disappeared</s>  almost at the same instant surajahfired again</s> i had one that time sahib</s> it was now quiet for some little time</s>  then a horseman dashed suddenlypast and galloped up the valley at full speed</s> the end window surajah</s>  bring him down if you can</s> surajah ran there and fired</s> i have missed him</s>  he said in a tone of deep disappointment</s> it does not make much difference</s>  if you had hit him they could havesent another off close to the opposite side of the valley</s>  there is nodoubt as to what he has gone for</s>  you see they have lost six killedand one wounded and they must know that they have not the slightestchance of taking this hut</s>  i have no doubt that he has ridden back tobring down the infantry from the fort</s>  from the number of huts roundthe gate and the sound of talking i should think there were fifty orsixty at leastperhaps a hundred</s> if they send down fifty we shall have sharp work</s>  our difficultywill be to prevent them from making a rush at all the windowstogether</s>  if they were to get there they could riddle us with balls</s> could we block them up sahib</s> that is just what i was thinking dick replied</s>  we might tryanyhow</s>  it will be an hour and a half before they are down here</s>  itmust be past four now and in another hour daylight will begin tobreak</s> there is any amount of the old thatch down on the floor</s>  the best waywould be to fill up the window holes with it first then to put two orthree bits of wood across and a strong piece down behind it and tokeep that in its place by wedging one of the long beams against it</s>  ifthey came up and tried to pull the thatch out we could fire throughit with our pistols and we will make a loophole below each when wehave got the work done</s> it was not so difficult a business as they thought it would be</s>  thewindows were little more than a foot across and two feet high</s>  it wasbut the work of a few minutes to fill these up with the masses ofthatch</s>  when this was done they picked out thick pieces of wood forcrossbars</s>  then they took a beam eight feet long made a hole withtheir tulwars in the clay floor close to the wall put one end of thebeam into it and reared it upright against the window</s>  dick held itin its place while surajah hacked a deep notch in ita by no meansdifficult matter for it was half rotten with exposure</s> the notch was cut just opposite the middle of the window</s>  the threecrosspieces were then put into their place and the upright pressedfirmly against them</s>  one end of a long beam was placed in the notchthe other in a slight hole made in the ground thus forming a strutwhich held the rest firmly in their positions</s> that is a good job done dick said but a very hot one</s>  nowsurajah sharpen three or four pieces of wood and drive them downinto the ground at the foot of that strut then it will be as firm asa rock</s> they then proceeded in the same way with the other two windows</s> it is getting light fast dick said as he wiped the perspirationfrom his face</s>  take a look out up the valley</s>  they ought to be comingby this time</s> surajah applied his eye to one of the loopholes</s> i can see them he said</s>  they are half a mile away</s>  there are twomounted men</s>  i expect one is their officer and the other the man whorode back to fetch them</s> let us set to work at the loopholes under the windows surajah</s>  it ismost important to get them done</s>  you make the one at the end i willdo that one looking into the street</s>  put it as close to the beam asyou can</s> they worked hard and it was not long before the walls were pierced</s> now surajah you do the one at the back</s>  the fellows will soon bewithin range and i will give them a lesson to be careful</s>  they willnaturally break up and go round behind the houses opposite as theycan find shelter nowhere else and for a bit at any rate we shallget them all on one side of us which is what we want</s> dick carried the six guns to the end of the hut and then applied hiseye to the loophole there</s>  the enemy were coming along at a run in aconfused mass</s> i cant very well miss them he muttered to himself as he thrusthis gun through a loophole and fired</s>  without waiting to see theresult he thrust another gun out aimed and fired</s> never mind the hole surajah he said</s>  come here and reload</s> the four other shots were discharged in rapid succession</s>  themysoreans at first opened an irregular fire on the hut</s>  when the sixthshot was fired they left the road in a body and ran across thevalley leaving four of their number on the ground behind them</s> as soon as the guns were reloaded surajah returned to his work</s>  itwas now broad daylight and the sun was shining upon the hilltops</s>  aquarter of an hour passed without a movement from the enemy</s>  dick andhis companion occupied the time in further strengthening the door withcrossbeams kept in their place by struts</s> if they break it to splinters dick said when they had finishedthey will hardly be able to force their way in for if they were totry to crawl in between those crossbeams they would be completely atour mercy</s> now we must get ready for a rush</s>  i expect they will come alltogether</s>  there are the six guns and three pistols each</s>  keep one ofthe latter in reserve</s>  we ought not to waste a shot and if they loseten men i should think they will give up the attack on the door</s> stand clear of it surajah</s>  they will probably fire into it beforethey chargekeep down below the level of the loopholes</s> presently a volley of musketry was fired and the door was riddled bybullets</s>  then a number of figures sprang from between the two oppositehouses and rushed at the door</s>  two of them carried a long heavybeam</s> two shots flashed out in return from the hut</s>  one of the men carryingthe beam fell as did an officer who was leading them but instantlyanother caught up the end of the timber and in a moment a crowd wereclustered round the door</s>  several caught hold of the beam and swungit as though they meant to use it as a battering ram</s> two more puffs of smoke spurted out from the loopholes and again twoof the men fell</s>  the others however swung it forward with a crashagainst the door</s>  the end of the beam went right through the rottenwoodwork</s>  dick and surajah fired their last musket shots with asdeadly effect as before</s>  the next blow dashed the door from itshinges and split and shattered by the former shocks it fell forwardinto the road while a yell of triumph broke from the mysoreans</s> this died away however when they saw the three crossbars blockingtheir entrance</s>  again two pistol shots carried death among them</s> load your guns surajah</s> but before surajah had time to do so the mysoreans made a rush at thedoor</s>  the defenders stepped forward and fired between the crossbarsand then drawing their tulwars ran the two men in front through thebody</s>  as they dropped those behind them drew back</s> the last pistols</s>  dick shouted and they fired two shots into thecrowd</s> this completed the consternation of the enemy</s>  it seemed to them thatthe defenders possessed an unlimited supply of firearms</s>  alreadytwelve shots had been fired and not one had failed to take effect</s> with a cry of consternation they fled down the street leaving theground in front of the fatal door strewn with bodies</s> the defenders instantly set about the work of recharging theirfirearms</s>  they were not interrupted but presently an irregular fireopened upon them from the jungle that had taken the place of thegarden between the opposite houses</s> we may as well lie down at full length dick said setting theexample</s>  there is no use in running risks</s>  you keep that side andlisten attentively</s>  it is likely enough that they will work roundbehind next time and try the windows</s>  by the way they are firing ifancy there are not more than five or six of them opposite</s> another half hour passed</s>  then surajah exclaimed i can hear them onthis side</s> dick got up and crossed at once</s> i will take the loophole under this window</s>  you go to the one at theend</s>  i expect they will try both windows at once</s> dick placed the muzzle of his gun in the loophole and glancingalong saw that something dark barred his view</s>  he fired at once</s> there was a loud cry and a fall then a rush to the window and amoment later a hole appeared in the thatch</s>  dick discharged twopistols through it and as he did so surajah fired</s> the thatch was speedily pulled down as the enemy had learned to avoidthe loopholes</s>  a yell of rage rose as the fallen thatch showed themthat the window was defended with crossbars in the same way as thedoor</s>  immediately afterwards dick had a narrow escape from a shotfired through a loophole close to him</s> stoop down he cried and crouching below the level of theloopholes made his way to the end of the hut</s>  recharge the gunsfirst surajah</s>  they may fire away through the loopholes as long asthey like</s>  it is lucky we made them so high except the three underthe windows</s>  we must be careful in keeping out of the line of those</s> you sit down where you can command the end window and the onebehindi will watch the front window and door</s>  a bold fellow mightput his musket through and pick one of us off and that is what wehave to prevent</s>  so keep your gun in readiness and if you see a headappear dont miss it</s> the enemy now kept up a constant fire through the loopholes at the endand back of the house but as these were shoulder high and there wasno altering the elevation of the guns the shots flew harmlessly overthe heads of the defenders</s>  several times dick went to one or otherof the loopholes pistol in hand and standing close beside itwaited until a shot was fired and then thrusting the barrel into theloophole fired before another gun could be inserted the dischargebeing generally followed by a sharp cry of pain</s> after this had gone on for nearly an hour the assailants evidentlybecame discouraged</s>  the shots came from the loopholes less frequentlyand presently ceased altogether</s> i would give a good deal to know what they are up to dick saidafter a long pause</s> shall i look through the loophole</s>  surajah asked</s> certainly not</s>  there will be a man standing at each of them waitingin expectation of our taking a look out</s> but there are none in front surajah said</s> that is more than we can say</s>  they have not been firing on that sidebut they may have men there now</s>  no we will leave well alonesurajah</s>  the longer they delay the better for us</s> keep your eye on the top of the wall as well as on the window</s>  theymay have made some ladders by this time and may intend to try ashot</s> perhaps they are gone</s>  surajah suggested</s> it is quite possible</s>  they must know that our troop comes up hereearly and as they have four miles to walk back to the fort andseveral wounded to carry with them they certainly wont stay muchlongerif as you say they have not gone already</s> it was indeed well that surajah had not attempted to look out at oneof the loopholes for at the time he asked the question a darkfigure was standing at each looking along the barrel of his gun inreadiness to fire the moment the light was obscured</s> a few minutes later dick exclaimedhow stupid</s>  we can easily test whether there is any one theresurajah and taking up a piece of thatch he pushed it suddenlyacross one of the loopholes</s> no shot followed the action and he went round the hut and repeatedthe experiment at each of them</s> they have all gone he said confidently</s>  had they been outsidethey would certainly have fired directly the light was obscured</s> standing a short distance back from the end window he looked outbetween the crossbeams</s> hurrah</s>  he shouted</s>  there they go up the road</s>  they are a quarterof a mile away</s>  they are not more than half as strong as they werewhen they came down</s>  they are carrying eight or ten figures on theirshoulders on litters or doors</s> i dont see the cavalry surajah said as he joined him</s> no</s>  it is likely enough that they may be in hiding among the hutsopposite and are waiting in hopes that we may be foolish enough totake it for granted that they are all gone and pull down the bars ofthe door</s>  i expect they will stay until they see our troop coming upthe valley</s> they continued to look out from the window from which they had nowremoved the bars</s>  half an hour later dick exclaimedthere they go up that side of the valley</s>  i have no doubt they seeour troop and that in a few minutes we shall hear them coming</s> it was not long before they heard a trampling of horses and a momentlater the rajahs voice exclaimedwhy what is this</s>  here are a dozen dead bodies</s>  they are mysoreansby their dress</s> all right uncle dick shouted we will be out as soon as we getthese bars down</s>  we have been standing a siege</s> it did not take long to remove the bars</s>  the rajah and his men haddismounted as soon as some of the latter had gone round the hut andhad brought back the report that there were five more dead on thatside</s>  as dick and his companion stepped out the rajah exclaimedwhat are you alone</s> yes there is no one with us uncle</s> do you mean to say that you two have defended this place alone andkilled sixteen of the enemy besides some i see lying farther up theroad</s> yes uncle</s>  you see it was a pretty strong position and we had timeto block up the doors and windows and to make loopholes to firethrough</s> what think you of that anwar</s>  the rajah exclaimed to the captain ofthe troop</s>  my nephew and rajbullubs son have shown themselves bravefighters have they not</s> it is wonderful the captain said and exclamations of admirationbroke from the men standing round</s> tell us all about it dick the rajah went on</s> it is a long story uncle but the real news is that tippoo with hisarmy has left the head of the western passes and has gone toseringapatam</s>  he is going to march down one of the passes this sideat once</s>  provisions have been collected for his army to consume on themarch</s>  no one knows yet which pass he will come down by but it willnot be far from here for they are buying up cattle in the villages atthe top of the ghauts</s> that is important indeed dick and we must ride off without delaybut first i must have a look at this fortress of yours</s> he entered the hut the soldiers crowding in after him and examinedthe defences at the windows and the loopholes while dick explainedhow the bars had been arranged to defend the door</s> we began on the other side uncle</s>  we had a fight with four men whocame up with us there</s>  only one of them got awayand he left his gunbehind</s>  it was lucky for their guns and pistols were of immense useto us</s>  we could not have held out with only our own weapons</s> about twenty of their cavalry came up a few minutes afterwards</s>  webeat them off and then they sent up to the fort for infantry andabout fifty men came down and attacked us just at sunrise</s>  they keptit up to within half an hour ago</s>  then the infantry marched backknowing of course that your troop generally got here about seven</s> the horsemen stayed here till within a few minutes of your arrival</s> no doubt they thought that we should suppose they had all gone andmight venture out and let them get a shot at us</s> why it must have been a veritable battle dick</s> there was a good deal of noise uncle though not much danger</s>  solong as we kept below the level of the loopholes and windows and outof the line of the door there was no chance of our being hit</s> they must have made a strong attack on the door the rajah said</s>  isee that the two lying next to it were both killed by sword thrusts</s> yes that was the most critical moment uncle</s>  we had emptied nearlyall our barrels and if they could have broken down the bars which ihave no doubt they could have done if they had stuck to it theywould have made very short work of us</s> now let us be going the rajah said</s>  you can tell me the wholestory as we go along</s> two of the sowars were ordered to give up their horses to dick andsurajah and to mount behind comrades</s>  then they started down thevalley dick riding between his uncle and the captain while surajahtook his place with the two other officers of the troop</s>  they rode sorapidly that dicks story was scarcely concluded by the time theyreached the village where the troops were quartered</s> well you have done marvelously well dick his uncle said</s>  surajahdeserves the highest praise too</s>  now i will write a note to thebritish officer with the nabob giving the news of tippoos movementsand will send it off by two of the troopers at once</s>  where colonelmaxwells force is i have no idea</s>  it marched to join generalmeadows on the day we came up here</s> in the meantime you can have a wash while breakfast is being cooked</s> i have no doubt that you are ready for it</s> i am indeed uncle</s>  we had nothing yesterday but a few cakes madeof flour and water and have had nothing at all since</s> all right lad</s>  i will be ready almost as soon as breakfast is</s> after the meal was over the rajah lit his hookah and saidyou must go through the story again this evening dick</s>  you cutshort some of the details as you told it to me on the road and iwant to understand it all thoroughly</s>  you had better turn in now for along sleep</s>  you must want it badly enough lad after the work of thetwo last nights</s> dick slept until his uncle roused him at six oclock</s> dinner will be ready in ten minutes</s>  it is just as well that youshould get up for two or three hours</s>  after that you will be goodfor another sleep till morning</s>  we shall have to look out sharp nowand keep a couple of vedettes always at that village as for all weknow this may be the pass by which tippoo is coming down</s> dick got up rather reluctantly but he was not long in shaking off hisdrowsiness and after dinner was able to go through the story againwith full details of his adventures</s> i dont know what i should have done without surajah uncle</s>  he is acapital fellow and if ever i go up by myself into mysore to lookfor my father i hope that you will let me take him</s> that i will certainly do dick</s>  ever since i first heard of yourplans i have quite decided that you ought not to go alone</s>  i daresayi should have chosen an older man to accompany you but after what youand the lad have done together i dont think you could do better thantake him</s>  of course such an affair would demand infinitely greatercaution and care though not greater courage than you had occasion touse on this excursion</s>  it is one thing to enter a village to ask afew questions make a purchase or two and be off again but it is avery different thing to be among people for weeks or perhaps monthsand to live as one of themselves</s>  however we may hope that this warwill end in our army marching to seringapatam when we shall recovermany of the prisoners in tippoos hands</s> i do not say all</s>  we know how many hundreds remained in his powerlast time in spite of his promise to deliver them all up and maybesomething of the same sort will occur next time</s>  numbers may be sentaway by him to the hill fortresses dotted all over the country andwe should never be able to obtain news of them</s>  however we must hopefor the best</s> the next morning the troopers arrived with a letter from the englishresident at arcot</s>  the rajah glanced through it and handed it todick with the remarkyou will not get the honour you deserve dick</s> the letter randear rajahyour news would be extremely valuable were it correct butunfortunately it is not so and doubtless the reports brought down byyour nephew were spread by tippoo for the purpose of deceiving us</s> or possibly he may have intended to have come that way butafterwards changed his mind</s>
 we have news that just after colonelmaxwell effected his junction with general meadows near caveripatamand was about to ascend the ghauts by the tapour pass tippoo camedown by that very route slipped past them and is marching on totrichinopoly</s>  that being the case i see no further utility in yourremaining with your troop in the passes but think it were best thatyou should reassemble them at once and march here</s>  there is nochance of tippoo capturing trichinopoly before meadows who isfollowing him can come up and force on a battle so it is likely thatthe mysore army may continue their march in this direction in whichcase every fighting man will be of use to defend this place until itis relieved by the general</s> dick uttered an exclamation of disgust as he laid the letter down</s> it does not matter about my news turning out wrong he said but itis very bad that general meadows should have allowed tippoo to passhim as he may do frightful damage to the country before he can beovertaken</s> he never can be overtaken as long as he chooses to keep ahead</s>  he ishampered with no baggage train</s>  he lives on the plunder of the countryhe passes through and the british army with all its baggage andprovision train has no more chance of overtaking him than it has offlying</s> messengers were at once sent off to call in the scattered portions ofthe troop</s>  these were assembled in twentyfour hours and at oncestarted for arcot where they arrived after a two days march</s>  theythere learned that tippoo had appeared before trichinopoly and afterpillaging and laying waste the sacred island of seringham had marchednorth</s> day after day news arrived of the devastation he was committing onhis march</s>  at thiagur however he met with a serious repulse</s>  greatnumbers of the inhabitants from the surrounding country had crowdedinto the town with their valuables and tippoo expecting a richbooty attacked the town but although its fortifications wereinsignificant the little garrison was commanded by captain flint theofficer who had so bravely defended wandiwash in the previous war andtwo assaults were repulsed with serious loss</s> at trinalee thirtyfive miles farther north he was more successfulcapturing the town and putting the inhabitants to the sword</s>  heretippoo changed his course and marched for pondicherry capturingpermacoil by the way</s> the news that tippoo had changed his course to the southeast wasreceived with great joy at arcot</s>  although confident that this capitalwould be able to resist any sudden attack the belief had been generalthat the whole territory would be laid waste as it had been by hyderand hopes were now entertained that the british army would arrive intime to bar tippoos further progress</s> chapter 8 the invasion of mysore</s> for some time there was a pause in the hostilities</s>  tippoo remainedwith his army near pondicherry carrying on negotiations with thefrench governor and arranging for the despatch of an envoy to francewith a request that the republic would furnish him with six thousandfrench troops</s>  while he was thus wasting his time general meadows wasslowly moving with the army towards an encampment formed at velloutsome eighteen miles west of madras</s> on the 14th of december a messenger arrived with the news that lordcornwallis had arrived from calcutta two days before withconsiderable reinforcements and that he was about to assume thesupreme command of the army</s>  the news caused unbounded satisfaction</s> by the extreme dilatoriness of his movements and especially by themanner in which he had allowed tippoo to pass him near caveripatamwhen he might easily have attacked him while his army was stillstruggling through the pass general meadows had disgusted his troops</s> he had frittered away without striking a single blow the finest armythat the british had up to that time ever put into the field inindia and had enabled tippoo unmolested to spread destruction overa large extent of country</s> the only countervailing success that had been gained by the britishwas a brilliant victory won by colonel hartley who was in command ofa bombay force consisting of a european regiment and two battalionsof sepoys</s>  with these he engaged hossein ali who had been left bytippoo in malabar with a force of 9000 men when the sultan firstretreated before general meadows advance</s>  this force was defeatedwith a loss of 1000 men killed and wounded 900 including hosseinhimself taken prisoners on the field and 1500 in the pursuit thetotal british loss being only 52 men</s>  a few days after this victorygeneral abercrombie arrived from madras with reinforcements and thewhole of tippoos fortified places in malabar were captured one afteranother and the entire province conquered</s> as soon as lord cornwallis reached the camp at vellout with a largetrain of draught animals that had been brought by sea from calcuttathe rajah and his troops received orders to join him</s>  it was on the29th of january 1791 that the commander in chief arrived at velloutand the rajah arrived there on the 4th of february</s>  as he was thebearer of a letter from the resident at arcot he was at once enabledto have an interview with lord cornwallis</s>  on finding that he couldspeak english the general received him with much courtesy</s> i am glad indeed to have a troop like yours with us rajah hesaid</s>  there are few of my officers who know anything of this part ofthe country and your local knowledge will be invaluable</s>  moreover asi do not speak the language myself it will be a great advantage tohave someone with me through whom i can communicate freely with thepeople of the country</s>  there is no doubt that such communications aremuch more effectual when they come through one of their own princesthan through english officers</s>  i shall therefore order that on themarch a space be allotted for the encampment of your troop by theside of that occupied by my own escort and hope that when notemployed on scouting or other duties you will ride with my staff</s> your mother rajah was an english lady i am told</s> she was sir</s>  my sister who married an englishman is at present inmadras with my family and her son is with me</s> i beg to recommend him to your lordship</s>  he speaks my languageperfectly and having been brought up in his fathers countrynaturally speaks english as well as hindustani and will understandfar better than i can do any orders that you may give</s>  he has comeout with his mother in the hopes of finding his father who has ifalive been a prisoner for several years in the hands of tippoo</s> he is a fine young fellow</s>  the other day he made a most dangerousreconnaissance into mysore in order to ascertain tippoos movements</s> he had with him a young officer of mine two or three years older thanhimself and when i tell you that the two young fellows held a ruinedhut for hours against the attack of some seventy of tippoos troopsand beat them off with a loss of upwards of twenty killed i needhardly say that he has no lack of courage</s> you are right indeed rajah</s>  let the lad ride beside you with mystaff</s>  some day he will perhaps shorten a long days march by givingme details of this adventure of his</s> on the 5th of february the army started on its march and on the 11threached vellore</s>  tippoo had for two months been wasting his time atpondicherry but upon hearing news that instead of as he expectedthe english general having marched south from vellout to meet him hehad turned westward and that mysore itself was threatened withinvasion he hastily broke up his camp and marched at full speed forthe ghauts and reaching the table land hurried to oppose thebritish army as it endeavoured to ascend the pass going from vellorethrough amboor by which he made sure he would come</s> lord cornwallis encouraged him in the idea by sending a battalion aconsiderable distance up the pass while he started north and enteredthe easy pass of mooglee leading west from chittoor to moolwagle</s>  hepushed rapidly up the pass and gained the summit before tippoo couldreach the spot and oppose him</s>  it took four days longer for thebattering train baggage and provisions to reach the top of the pass</s> after a delay of a day or two to rest the animals which includedsixtyseven elephants which had been brought from bengal the army setout for bangalore the second largest town in mysore</s> the rajahs troops had been busily employed from the time the armymoved from vellout</s>  the men on their tireless little horses carriedhis messages to the various divisions and brigades brought up news ofthe progress of the train or rode on ahead with the officers of thequartermasters department whose duty it was to precede the army todecide on the camping ground and to mark off the spots to be occupiedby the various corps</s>  in this way they saved the regular cavalry frommuch fatiguing duty</s> surajah and dick were generally with the party that went on with thequartermasters and as soon as the camping ground was fixed uponaided them in the purchase of forage and food from the natives as itwas most desirable that the forty days provisions the army carriedwith it should remain intact until the army had passed up the ghauts</s> beyond that it was expected that it would be harassed by the mysorehorse who would render it impossible for the cavalry to go out tocollect forage or provisions from the country through which itmarched</s> so well did the rajahs troop perform its duties that lord cornwallisordered it to be taken on the strength of the army and to receive thepay and rations of native cavalry in the service</s>  on the day afterleaving vellore the general sent an orderly to request the rajah andhis nephew to ride with him</s> i have not had an opportunity of hearing of your scoutingexpedition he said to dick and shall be glad if you will give mefull details of it</s> dick related the adventure from the time they had started</s> you were wonderfully lucky in getting back safely the generalsaid when he had finished</s>  at least luck is not the proper wordfor your safety was due to your quick wittedness and courage and yourescape with your companion from the guard house the manner in whichyou got through the fort in the pass and your defence of that hutuntil the rajahs troop arrived to your rescue were all of themadmirably managed</s> he then proceeded to inquire further into the object for which dickhad come out to india</s> i heartily wish you success in your search he said and sincerelyhope we may obtain news of your father</s>  i do not know what yourintentions may be afterwards but should you wish to enter the armyi will at once nominate you to a commission in one of our nativecavalry regiments</s> i am deeply obliged to your excellency dick replied but as if welearn nothing of my father during the war i am quite resolved tospend if necessary some years in mysore in the search for him imust therefore be free to devote my time to that</s> at any rate the general said if at any time you should feel freeto accept my offer it will be open to you</s>  in the meantime i willappoint you one of the interpreters to the army during theexpedition and will attach you to my own staff</s>  it will give you arecognised position and it is only right that as you are doing goodservice you should receive pay</s>  you shall be put in orders thisevening</s>  you can of course continue to camp and live with therajah</s> the change made very little difference in dicks duties and hecontinued at his former work in the quartermasters department untilthe army was ready for its advance to bangalore</s>  to the generalsurprise as the army moved forward nothing was seen of tippooscavalry by which they had expected to be continually harassed</s>  thesultan had as soon as he perceived that bangalore was threatenedhurried the whole army to that city where he had sent his harem whenhe started from seringapatam to attack travancore and instead ofsending off a few hundred horsemen to escort them to the capitalwhile with his army he opposed the advance of the british he took hiswhole force with him in order to remove his harem with all the pompand ceremony with which their passage through the country wasgenerally accompanied</s>  consequently it was not until after takingwithout resistance the forts of colar and ooscotah and arrivingwithin ten miles of bangalore that the army encountered tippooscavalry</s> this was on the 4th of march</s>  they made an attempt to reach thebaggage trains but were sharply repulsed and on the following daythe army took up its position before bangalore</s>  as they approached thetown three horsemen dashed out from a small grove and rode furiouslytowards a little group consisting of lord cornwallis generalmeadows and the staff who were reconnoitring at some little distancefrom the head of the column</s>  it was evident that their intention wasto cut down the general</s> the rajah who was riding as usual with the staff dashed forward withfour or five other officers and encountered the horsemen before theycould reach him</s>  the rajah cut down one of them another was killed byone of the staff and the third knocked off his horse and captured</s> it was learned that the enterprise was not a planned one but was theresult of a quarrel between the men themselves</s>  one had charged theothers with cowardice and in return they had challenged him to followthem where they dared go</s>  all had prepared themselves for theenterprise by half intoxicating themselves with bhang and thus madebut a poor fight when they found their object thwarted by theofficers who threw themselves between them and their intended victim</s> bangalore was a fine town situated on a plain so elevated that theclimate was temperate the soil fertile and vegetation abundant</s>  thetown was of considerable extent that portion lying within thefortifications being a mile and a quarter long by half a mile broad</s> it was surrounded by a strong rampart a thick hedge and a deep dryditch</s>  the wall however did not extend across the side facing thefort whose guns were supposed to render it ample protection</s> the fort was oval in shape and about nine hundred yards across atits greatest diameter</s>  it was defended by a broad rampartstrengthened by thirty semicircular bastions and five outworks</s>  thetwo gates one at each end were also protected by outworks</s>  in thefort stood the splendid palace built by tippoo</s>  here also were immensefoundries of cannon factories for muskets the arsenal and largemagazines of grain and ammunition</s> the position taken up by the army lay to the northeast of the petahor town and the next morning a reconnoitring party escorted bycolonel floyd with the whole of the cavalry and a brigade ofinfantry went out to examine the defences of the town and fort</s> seeing a large body of laden elephants and camels escorted by astrong body of horsemen colonel floyd rode with the cavalry to attackthem</s>  the movement was a rash one as the guns on the fort openedfire and although at first he defeated the mysore horse a heavy firewas poured upon him when entangled in broken ground</s>  he himself wasshot by a musket ball which striking him in the face passed throughboth jaws</s>  it was at first believed that he was dead but he wascarried back to camp and ultimately recovered</s>  this rash attack costthe lives of seventyone men and of four times as many horses</s> as tippoos army was lying at a distance of only six miles away thegeneral determined that it would be best in the first place tocapture the town without delay and to assault the fort on that sideas he could then do so without any fear of an attack by tippoo whowould be able to harass him constantly were he to approach the fortfrom any other direction</s>  orders were therefore issued for the 36thregiment supported by the 26th bengal sepoys and a party ofartillery under colonel moorhouse to prepare to storm the north gateof the town at daybreak the next morning</s> as soon as dawn broke the troops rushed forward against the gate</s>  theoutside work was speedily stormed but as they issued from it towardsthe gate itself they were received with a very heavy fire from thewalls together with a storm of hand grenades</s>  colonel moorhousebrought forward a six pounder receiving two wounds as the piece wasrun up to the gate</s>  the first time it was fired it had no effectbeyond making a small hole and the next shot had no greater success</s> colonel moorhouse ordered a twelvepounder to be brought up but as hewas aiding to put it into position another ball struck him and hefell dead</s> while the artillerymen were pouring shot after shot into the gate theroar of musketry was unceasing the 36th keeping up an incessant fireupon the enemy upon the wall in order to cover as much as possiblethe operations of the gunners</s>  at last the gate gave way</s>  the troopspoured in cheering loudly and the enemy at once fled</s> many however took up their positions in the houses and kept up agalling fire until their places of refuge were stormed by detachmentsof troops scattered through the town</s>  by nine oclock all was overand the town completely in the possession of the british</s> tippoo furious at its having been so speedily captured moved downearly in the afternoon with a strong force of infantry and marchingalong by the side of the fort endeavoured to force his way into thetown through the open space at that end</s>  he was aided by the guns ofthe fort while his artillery kept up a heavy cannonade upon thebritish encampment</s> when the sultan was seen marching towards the town with the evidentintention of endeavouring to retake it the 76th regiment was sent into reinforce the garrison and the three battalions opposed so steadya resistance to tippoos infantry that the latter were forced to fallback after sustaining a loss of five hundred men</s>  the troops begannext morning to erect batteries</s> the position was a singular one</s>  a small army was undertaking thesiege of a strong fortress while an army vastly outnumbering it waswatching them and was able at any moment to throw largereinforcements into the fort through the mysore gate which was at theopposite end of the fort to that attacked the efforts of the britishbeing directed against the delhi gate which faced the town</s> the advantage which had been gained by the employment of the greattrain carrying the provisions for the troops was now manifest forunless the army had been so provided it would have been forced toretreat as in the face of tippoos army with its great host ofcavalry it would have been impossible to gather provisions</s> the first batteries erected by the engineers proved to be too fardistant from the wall of the fort to effect any material damage andothers were commenced at a much shorter range</s>  the work was performedwith great difficulty for the guns of the defenders were well servedand a storm of missiles were poured night and day into the town andagainst the batteries</s>  the garrison which consisted of eight thousandmen were frequently relieved by fresh troops from the sultans armyand were thus able to maintain their fire with great vigour</s> on the 17th tippoo cannonaded the british camp from a distance butwithout doing great damage</s>  in the meantime the fire of our siegeguns was steadily doing its work in spite of the heavy fire kept upon them</s>  the stone facing of the bastion next to the gateway was soonknocked away but the earth banks behind which were very thick andconstructed of a tough red clay crumbled but slowly</s>  still thebreach was day by day becoming more practicable and tippoo alarmedat the progress that had been made moved his army down towards theeast side of the fort and seemed to meditate an attack upon ourbatteries</s>  he placed some heavy guns behind a bank surrounding a largetank and opened some embrasures through which their fire would havetaken our trenches which were now pushed up close to the fort inflank</s> lord cornwallis at once directed a strong force to advance as if withthe intention of attacking the new work and tippoo ordered his troopsto retire from it</s>  it was evident however that he had determined togive battle in order to save the fort and the english generaltherefore determined to storm the place that very night the 21st ofmarch</s>  the preparations were made secretly lest the news should betaken to tippoo by one of the natives in the town and it was notuntil late in the evening that orders were issued to the troops whichwere to take part in the assault</s> the column was to be composed of the grenadier and light companies ofall the european regiments and these were to be followed andsupported by several battalions of sepoys</s>  the force commanded bycolonel maxwell at eleven oclock issued from the town and advancedthrough the trenches</s>  the besieged were vigilant and the instant theleading company sprang from the trenches and in the bright moonlightran forward to the breach a number of blue lights were lighted allalong the ramparts and a heavy musketry fire was opened</s> the scene was eagerly watched by the troops in the camp every featurebeing distinctly visible</s>  the storming party could be seen rushing upthe breach and mounting by ladders over the gateway which was thecentral object of attack</s>  the enemy gathered in masses at the top ofthe breach but as soon as the stormers collected in sufficientstrength and charged them with the bayonet they broke and dispersed</s> the grenadiers moved along the ramparts to the right clearing it ofits defences as they went along</s>  the light companies did the samealong the ramparts to the left while the sepoys descended into thebody of the fort</s>  the whole of the defenders fled towards the mysoregate at the other end of the fort and when the three bodies of troopsmet there they found the gate blocked by the masses of fugitives</s> they charged them on all sides</s>  the governor a brave old soldier anda great favourite of the sultan died fighting gallantly to the last</s> six hundred of the garrison fell and three hundred for the most partwounded were taken prisoners</s>  the british loss was only fiftyofficers and men killed and wounded</s> the body of the governor was found next morning among the slain andlord cornwallis sent a message to tippoo with an offer to have thebody carried to his camp for burial</s>  tippoo however replied that theproper place for a soldier to be buried was where he fell andaccordingly the brave old soldier was laid to rest in the fort bythe mohammedan troops in the sepoy regiments with all militaryhonours</s> while the assault was going on tippoowho in spite of theprecautions taken had received news of the intention of the generaland had warned the garrison of the fort to be prepareddespatched twoheavy columns as soon as the fire opened to attack the british campon its flank</s>  the movement had been foreseen and prepared against andthe attacks were both repulsed with heavy loss</s> the capture of the fort was effected but just in time for theprovisions were almost entirely consumed and the scanty rations wereeked out by digging up the roots of grasses and vegetables within thecircuit of our pickets</s>  the draught and carriage cattle were dyingdaily by hundreds</s>  the few remaining intended for food were in soemaciated a state that the flesh was scarcely eatable</s>  and worst ofall the supply of ammunition was almost exhausted</s> the news of the fall of the fortress considered by the natives to bealmost impregnable under the very eyes of the sultan himself and hisgreat army produced a widespread effect greatly depressing thespirit of tippoos adherents while it proportionately raised those ofthe british troops and excited the hopes of the peoples conquered bytippoo and his father</s>  one result was that the polagars or chiefs ofa tribe that had but recently fallen under the yoke of mysore were atonce emboldened to bring in provisions to the town</s>  as great storeswere found in the magazines in the fort the starving animals regainedsome of their condition during the ten days that the troops wereoccupied in repairing the breaches burying the dead and placing thefort in a condition to stand a siege should tippoo return during theabsence of the army</s> when this was done and the stores of ammunition replenished from themagazines the army started on its march north to deonhully wherethey were to effect a junction with the cavalry that the nizam hadagreed to furnish</s>  as it marched it passed within three miles oftippoos army which was proceeding in a westerly direction</s>  tippoocould here have brought on a general engagement had he wished it butthe capture of bangalore had for the time cowed his spirit and hecontinued his march at a rate that soon placed him beyond the reachof the british</s> at deonhully a junction was effected with the nizams horse tenthousand in number</s>  these proved however of no real utility being amere undisciplined herd who displayed no energy whatever except inplundering the villagers</s>  the united force now moved southeast toguard a great convoy which was advancing up the pass of amboor andwhen this had been met returned to bangalore</s> during the operations of the siege the rajahs troop had remainedinactive and dicks duties as interpreter had been nominal</s>  atbangalore no english prisoners had been found and he was heartilyglad when he heard that it was the intention of lord cornwallis tomarch directly upon seringapatam</s> it was indeed a necessity for the english general to bring thecampaign to a speedy termination</s>  the war was entailing a tremendousstrain upon the resources of the company</s>  the nizam and mahrattis werenot to be depended upon in the slightest degree and might at anymoment change sides</s>  the french revolution had broken out and alleurope was alarmed and many of the english regiments might at anymoment be ordered to return home</s>  therefore anything like a thoroughconquest of mysore was impossible and there was only time to march toseringapatam to capture tippoos capital and to dictate terms tohim</s> immense exertions were made to restore the efficiency of the baggagetrain and on the 3rd of may the army marched from bangalore</s> tippoo devoured alike by rage and fear had taken no efficient stepsto meet the coming storm</s>  his first thought was to prevent the englishfrom discovering the brutal cruelty with which his white captives hadbeen treated</s>  he had over and over again given the most solemnassurances that he had no white prisoners in his hands and he nowendeavoured to prevent their obtaining evidence of his falsehood andcruelty by murdering the whole of those who remained in his hands atseringapatam</s>  having effected this massacre he next ordered all thepictures that he had caused to be painted on the walls of his palaceand other buildings holding up the english to the contempt and hatredof his subjects to be obliterated and he also ordered the bridgeover the northern loop of the cauvery to be destroyed</s>  he then set outwith his army to bar the passage of the british to seringapatam</s> the weather was extremely bad when the british started</s>  rain stormshad deluged the country and rendered the roads well nigh impassableand the movement was in consequence very slow</s>  tippoo had taken up astrong position on the direct road and in order to avoid him lordcornwallis took a more circuitous route and tippoo was obliged tofall back</s> the whole country through which the english passed had been wasted</s> the villages were deserted and not an inhabitant was to be met with</s> suffering much from wet and the immense difficulties of bringing onthe transport the army on the 13th of may arrived on the cauverynine miles east of seringapatam</s>  here it had been intended to crossthe river but the rains had so swollen the stream that it was foundimpossible to ford it</s>  it was therefore determined to march to apoint on the river ten miles above seringapatam where it was hopedthat a better ford could be found and where a junction might beeffected with general abercrombies bombay army which was moving upfrom the malabar coast and was but thirty or forty miles distant</s> to effect this movement it was necessary to pass within sight of thecapital</s>  tippoo came out and took up a strong position on a ruggedand almost inaccessible height</s>  in front was a swamp stretching to theriver while batteries had been thrown up to sweep the approaches</s> by a night march accomplished in the midst of a tremendous thunderand rain storm lord cornwallis turned tippoos position</s>  theconfusion occasioned by the storm however and the fact that severalof the corps lost their way prevented the full success hoped for frombeing attained and gave tippoo time to take up a fresh position</s> colonel maxwell led five battalions up a rocky ledge held by a strongbody of the mysore troops carried it at the point of the bayonet andcaptured some guns</s>  tippoo immediately began to fall back but wouldhave lost the greater portion of his artillery had not the nizamshorse moved forward across the line by which the british wereadvancing</s>  here they remained in an inert mass powerless to followtippoo and a complete barrier to the british advance</s>  sounaccountable was their conduct that it was generally believed in thearmy that it was the result of treachery and it was with difficultythat the british troops could be restrained from firing into the hordeof horsemen who had from the time they joined the force been worsethan useless</s> as soon as the british could make their way through or round theobstacle to their advance they pursued the retreating force oftippoo until it took refuge under the guns of the works roundseringapatam</s>  their loss had been 2000 that of the british 500</s> but the success was of little benefit to the latter</s>  the terriblestate of the roads and the want of food had caused the death ofgreat numbers of draught animals and the rest were so debilitated asto be absolutely useless and during the two days marches that wererequired to reach the point on the river previously determined uponthe battering train and almost the whole of the carts were draggedalong by the troops</s> the position of the army was bad in the extreme</s>  neither food norforage were to be obtained from the country round</s>  the troops werealmost on famine rations worn out by fatigue and by the marchthrough heavy rains and nights spent on the sodden ground</s>  tippooshorsemen hovered round them</s>  the cavalry of the nizam which had beenspecially engaged to keep the foe at a distance never once venturedto engage them</s>  it was absolutely impossible to communicate withgeneral abercrombie and after remaining but a couple of days in hisnew camp lord cornwallis felt that the army could only be saved fromdestruction by immediate retreat</s> no time was lost in carrying out the decision when once arrived at</s> some natives were paid heavily to endeavour to make their way toabercrombie with orders for him to retire down the ghauts again intomalabar</s>  then the whole of the battering train and the heavyequipments were destroyed and on the 26th of may the army startedfor its long march back to bangalore</s> it had made but six miles when a body of horsemen some two thousandstrong were seen approaching</s>  preparations were instantly made torepel an attack when a soldier rode in and announced that thehorsemen were the advance party of two mahratta armies close at hand</s> this was welcome news indeed for lord cornwallis had no idea thatthe mahrattis were within two hundred miles of him and had come tobelieve that they had no intention whatever of carrying out theirengagements</s> they had it appeared sent off a messenger every day to inform himof their movements but so vigilant were tippoos cavalry that notone of them ever reached the british</s>  in a few hours the junction wascompleted and the sufferings of the army were at an end</s>  stores ofevery kind were abundant with the mahrattis and not only food butclothing and every necessary of life could be purchased in the greatbazaars occupied by the mahratta traders who accompanied the army</s> had the two mahratta armies arrived a couple of days earlier thedestruction of the siege train would have been avoided seringapatamwould have been besieged abercrombies army of eight thousand menhave joined and the war brought at once to a conclusion</s>  it was nowhowever too late</s>  the means for prosecuting the siege of so powerfula fortress were altogether wanting and the united armies returned byeasy marches to bangalore</s> on the march the future plan of operations was decided upon</s>  lordcornwallis sent orders for the sum of 1500000 rupees that had beenintended for china to be at once despatched to bangalore for the useof the army and the allies</s>  the larger of the mahratta forces underpurseram bhow with a detachment of bombay troops that had accompaniedit were to march to the northwest and reduce some of the forts andtowns still held by the troops of mysore</s>  the other mahratta forceconsisting chiefly of cavalry under hurry punt were to remain atbangalore</s> the cause of the long delay on the part of the nizam and themahrattis was now explained</s>  the nizams troops had spent six monthsin the siege of the fortress of capool while an equal time had beenoccupied by purseram bhow in the siege of durwar a very strongplace garrisoned by ten thousand men</s> tippoo began negotiations immediately after his defeat nearseringapatam and these were continued until july when they werefinally broken off</s>  some months were occupied in reducing a number ofthe hill forts commanding the entrances to the various passes</s>  amongthese two deemed absolutely impregnable savandroog and nundidroogwere captured but the attack upon kistnagherry was repulsed withconsiderable loss</s> by the capture of these places lord cornwallis obtained access tosupplies from the malabar and carnatic coasts and was thus free fromthe risk of any recurrence of the misfortunes that had marred hisprevious attempt to lay siege to seringapatam and on the 5th offebruary 1792 he again came within sight of tippoos capital</s> chapter 9 news of the captive</s> during the nine months that had elapsed since the retreat from beforeseringapatam dick had been occupied in following out the main objectof his presence in mysore</s>  finding that purseram bhows army was thefirst that would be engaged in active service he asked permissionfrom the general to join it</s>  this was at once granted and lordcornwallis introduced him to the officer in command of the bombaytroops attached to that army informing him of the object that he hadin view</s> he will not be of much use as an interpreter he said for as thecountry in which you are going to operate formed until lately a partof the mahratta dominions mahratti will be principally spoken</s>  hewill therefore go simply as an officer of my staff attached for thepresent to your command</s>  he has asked me to allow him to take with himtwenty men belonging to the troop of his uncle the rajah oftripataly</s>  his object in doing so is that he will be able totraverse the country independently and can either rejoin me here orgo to one of the other columns operating against the hill forts if itshould seem to him expedient to do so</s>  should you desire to make areconnaissance at any time while he is with you you will find himuseful as an escort and will not be obliged to ask purseram bhow fora party of his cavalry</s> dick was sorry to leave his uncle whose tent he had now shared forthe last ten months</s>  he found himself however very comfortable withthe bombay troops being made a member of the mess consisting of theofficer in command and the four officers of his staff</s>  wishing to havesome duties with which to occupy himself he volunteered to act as anaidedecamp and although the work was little more than nominal itgave him some employment</s>  when not otherwise engaged he generallyrode with surajah whom his uncle had appointed to command the twentytroopers</s> in the year that had elapsed since his arrival in india dick hadgrown considerably and broadened out greatly and was now a powerfulyoung fellow of over seventeen</s>  he had since the troop joined thearmy of lord cornwallis exchanged his civilian dress for the undressuniform of an officer which he had purchased at the sale of theeffects of a young lieutenant on the generals staff who had diedjust as the army arrived before bangalore</s>  it was indeed necessarythat he should do this riding about as he did either on the staffof the general or with the officers of the quartermastersdepartment</s>  there would be no difficulty in renewing his uniform forhardship fever and war had carried off a large number of officersas well as men and the effects were always sold by auction on theday following the funeral</s> many hill fortresses were captured by the mahrattis but few offeredany resistance as their commanders knew well that there was no chanceof their being relieved while the men were in most cases delightedat the prospect of an escape from their enforced service and offreedom to return to their homes</s>  in a few of these forts englishcaptives were found</s>  some had been there for years their veryexistence being apparently forgotten by the tyrant</s>  some had beenfairly treated by the mysore governor and where this was the casethe latter was furnished by the british officers with paperstestifying to the kindness with which they had treated the prisonersand recommending them to the officers of any of the allied forces theymight encounter on their way home or when established there</s> upon the other hand some of the prisoners were found to have been allbut starved and treated with great brutality</s>  in two cases where thecaptives said that some of their companions had died from the effectsof the ill treatment they had received the governors were tried bycourt martial and shot while some of the others they sentenced to beseverely flogged</s> every captive released was closely scrutinised by dick and eagerlyquestioned</s>  from one of them he obtained news that his father hadcertainly been alive four years previously for they had been inprison together in a hill fort near bangalore</s> i was a civilian and he a sailor he said consequently neither ofus were of any use in drilling tippoos battalions and had been sentup there</s>  your father was well then</s>  the governor was a good fellowand we had nothing much to complain of</s>  mr</s>  holland was a favourite ofhis for being a sailor he was handy at all sorts of things</s>  hecould mend a piece of broken furniture repair the lock of a musketand make himself generally useful</s>  he left there before i did as thegovernor was transferred to some other forti never heard where itwasand he took your father with him</s>  i dont know whether he hadtippoos orders to do so or whether he took him simply because heliked him</s> at any rate he was the only prisoner who went with him</s>  the rest ofus remained there till a few months back when the fort was abandoned</s> it was just after the capture of bangalore and the place could haveoffered no resistance if a body of troops had been sent against it</s> at any rate an order arrived one morning and a few hours afterwardsthe place was entirely abandoned and we and the garrison marchedhere</s> my father was quite well</s> quite well</s>  he used to talk to me at times of trying to make hisescape</s>  being a sailor i have no doubt that he could have got downfrom the precipice on which the fort stood but he knew that if hedid so we should all suffer for it and probably be all put to deathas soon as tippoo heard that one of us had escapedfor that wasalways done in order to deter prisoners from trying to get away</s> do you think that there is any chance of his being still alive</s> that is more than i can possibly say</s>  you see we have not known muchof what is passing outside our prison</s>  some of the guards were goodnatured enough and would occasionally give us a scrap of news but weheard most from the illtempered ones who delighted in telling usanything they knew that would pain us</s> three or four months ago we heard that every white prisoner inseringapatam had been put to death by tippoos orders and thatdoubtless there would be a similar clearance everywhere else</s>  thenagain we were told that the english had retreated beaten frombefore seringapatam and that the last of them would soon be down theghauts</s>  but whether the prisoners have been killed in other hill fortslike this i cannot say although i suppose not or we should not haveescaped</s> certainly no such orders can have been sent to the forts here for wehave found a few prisoners in several of them</s>  of course it may beotherwise in the forts near the capital which tippoo might havethought were likely to fall into our hands while he may not haveconsidered it worth while to send the same orders to places so faraway as this where no british force was likely to come</s>  still at anyrate it is a great satisfaction that my father was alive four yearsago and that he was in kind hands</s>  that is all in favour of myfinding him still alive in one of the places we shall take for lordcornwallis intends to besiege some of the fortresses that command thepasses because he cannot undertake another siege of seringapatamuntil he can obtain supplies freely and regularly from beyond theghauts as nothing whatever can be obtained from the country round socompletely is it wasted by tippoos cavalry</s>  i have therefore greathopes that my father may be found in one of these forts</s> i hope indeed that you may find him</s>  i am convinced that thegovernor would save his life if he could do so though on the otherhand he would i am sure carry out any order he might receive fromtippoo</s>  of course he may not be in charge of a fort now and may havebeen appointed colonel of one of the regiments</s>  however it is alwaysbetter to hope that things will come as you wish them howeverunlikely it may seem that they will do so</s>  we have been living on hopehere though the chances of our ever being released were smallindeed</s>  of course we did not even know that tippoo and the englishwere at war until we heard that an english army was besiegingbangalore and even then we all felt that even if tippoo were beatenand forced to make peace it would make no difference to us</s>  he keptback hundreds of prisoners when he was defeated before and wouldcertainly not surrender any he now holds unless compelled to do soand no one would be able to give information as to the existence ofcaptives in these distant forts</s> and yet in the teeth of all these improbabilities we continued tohope and the hopes have been realised</s> the capture of forts by the mahratta army was abruptly checked</s> having so far met with such slight opposition purseram bhow becameover confident and scattered his force over a wide extent of countryin order that they might more easily find food and forage</s>  in thiscondition they were suddenly attacked by tippoo who took advantage ofthe english being detained at bangalore while the transport train wasbeing reorganised to strike a blow at the mahrattis</s> the stroke was a heavy one</s>  many of the detached parties werecompletely destroyed and the mahratta general after gathering therest to his standard was forced to retreat until strongreinforcements were sent him from bangalore</s> learning from them that it was probable lord cornwallis wouldadvance as soon as they rejoined him dick determined to go back tobangalore as it was unlikely that after the severe check they hadreceived the mahrattis would resume the offensive for a time</s> surajah and the men were glad to return to the troop and as soon asthe mysorean force returned to seringapatam dick without waiting forthe infantry to get in motion rode rapidly across the country withhis little party</s> he accompanied the english army during their operations obtainingpermission to go with the columns engaged in the siege of the hillfortresses and was present at the capture of all the most importantstrongholds</s>  to his bitter disappointment no english prisoners werefound in any of them and it was but too certain that all who mighthave been there had been massacred by tippoos orders on the firstadvance of the british against seringapatam</s> great indeed was the satisfaction of the army when they at last camein sight of the city</s>  the capital of mysore stood on an island in theriver cauvery</s>  this was four miles in length and two in breadth</s>  thetown stood in its centre the fort at the northern end</s>  the island wasapproached by two bridges one close to the fort the other at thesouth both being defended by strong batteries</s>  there were also threefords two of these being at the north end of the island and alsodefended by batteries the third was near the centre of the island amile below the fort and leading to the native town</s> the fort was separated from the rest of the island by a deep ditch cutacross it</s>  it was defended by numerous batteries</s>  there were twogardens on the island full of large trees one of them being theburial place of hyder ali</s>  this was connected with the fort by twoavenues of trees</s>  the country round was flat a considerable portionbeing almost level with the river and devoted to the cultivation ofrice while at other points a forest extended almost to the bank</s> after obtaining a view from some high ground of the city and oftippoos army encamped beyond its walls the british force took up itsposition six miles to the northwest of the city</s>  no sooner had thearmy reached their camping ground than lord cornwallis with hisstaff reconnoitred the approaches</s> a thick hedge formed by a wide belt of thorny shrubs interlaced andfastened together by cords extended from the bank of the river abouta thousand yards above seringapatam and making a wide sweep camedown to it again opposite the other end of the island</s> it was within the shelter of this formidable obstacle that tippoosarmy was encamped</s>  within the enclosed space were seven or eighteminences on which strong redoubts had been erected</s>  fearing thattippoo might as soon as he saw the position taken up by theassailants sally out with his army take the field and as beforecut all his communications lord cornwallis determined to strike ablow at once</s> at sunset orders were accordingly issued for the forces to move inthree columns at three oclock by which time the moon would be highenough to light up thoroughly the ground to be traversed</s>  the centrecolumn consisting of 3700 men under lord cornwallis himself was toburst through the hedge at the centre of the enemys position todrive the enemy before them and if possible to cross the ford tothe island with the fugitives</s> this however was not to be done until the centre column wasreinforced by that under general meadows which was to avoid a strongredoubt at the northwest extremity of the hedge and entering thefence at a point between the redoubt and the river drive the enemybefore it until it joined the centre column</s>  colonel meadows had3300 under his command</s>  the left column consisting of 1700 menunder colonel maxwell was first to carry a redoubt on carrygut hilljust outside the fence and having captured this to cut its waythrough the hedge and to cross the river at once with a portion ofthe centre column</s> unfortunately owing to a misunderstanding as to the order theofficer guiding general meadows column instead of taking it to apoint between the northwestern redoubt and the river led it directlyat the fort</s>  this was stoutly defended and cost the british eightymen and eleven officers</s>  leaving a strong garrison here the columnadvanced but came upon another redoubt of even greater strength andmagnitude and the general fearing that the delay that would takeplace in capturing it would entirely disarrange the plan of theattack thought he had better make his way out through the hedgemarch round it to the point where the centre column had entered itand so give lord cornwallis the support he must need opposed as hewas to the whole army of tippoo</s> in the meantime colonel maxwells force had stormed the work oncarrygut hill and had made its way through the hedge sufferingheavily as it did so from the fire of a strong body of the enemyconcealed in a water course</s>  the head of the centre column undergeneral knox after cutting its way through the hedge pushed on withlevelled bayonets thrust its way through the enemys infantry andmingling with a mass of fugitives crossed the main ford close underthe guns of the fort and took possession of a village half waybetween the town and the fort</s> unfortunately in the confusion but three companies had followed him</s> the rest of the regiment and three companies of sepoys crossed lowerdown and gained possession of a palace on the bank of the river</s>  theofficer in command however not knowing that any others had crossedand receiving no orders waited until day began to break</s>  he thenrecrossed the river and joined lord cornwallis a portion of whosecolumn having been reinforced by maxwells column crossed the rivernearly opposite the town</s> as they were crossing a battery of the enemys artillery opened aheavy fire upon them but colonel knox with his three companiescharged it in the rear drove out the defenders and silenced theguns</s> all this time lord cornwallis was with the reserve of the centralcolumn eagerly waiting the arrival of general meadows division</s> this in some unaccountable way had missed the gap in the hedge bywhich the centre column had entered and marching on halted at lastat carrygut hill where it was not discovered until daylight</s> the mysore army on its left was still unbroken and had been joined bylarge numbers of troops from the centre</s>  on discovering the smallnessof the force under lord cornwallis they attacked it in overwhelmingnumbers led by tippoo himself</s>  the british infantry advanced to meetthem with the bayonet and drove them back with heavy loss</s>  theyrallied and returned to the attack again and again but were as oftenrepulsed continuing their attacks however until daylight when lordcornwallis discovering at last the position of general meadowsjoined him on carrygut hill</s> when day broke the commanders of the two armies were able to estimatethe results of the nights operations</s>  on the english side the onlypositions gained were the works on carrygut hill the redoubt at thenorthwest corner of the hedge another redoubt captured by the centrecolumn and the positions occupied by the force under colonels stuartand knox at the eastern end of the island</s> the sultan found that his army was much reduced in strength no lessthan twentythree thousand men being killed wounded or missing</s>  ofthese the missing were vastly the most numerous for ten thousandchelahs young hindoos whom tippoo had carried off in his raids andforced to become soldiers and nominally mohammedans had takenadvantage of the confusion and marched away with their arms to theforest of coorg</s> tippoo made several determined efforts to drive colonel stuarts forceoff the island and to recapture the redoubts but was repulsed withsuch heavy loss that he abandoned the attempt altogether evacuatedthe other redoubts and brought his whole army across on to theisland</s> tippoo now attempted to negotiate</s>  he had already done so a monthbefore but lord cornwallis had refused to accept his advances sayingthat negotiation was useless with one who disregarded treaties andviolated articles of capitulation</s> send hither he wrote the garrison of coimbatoor and then we willlisten to what you have to say</s> lord cornwallis alluded to the small body of troops who underlieutenants chalmers and nash had bravely defended that town when ithad been attacked by one of tippoos generals</s>  the gallant littlegarrison had surrendered at last on the condition that they should beallowed to march freely away</s>  this condition had been violated bytippoo and the garrison had been marched as prisoners toseringapatam</s>  the two officers had been kept in the fort but most ofthe soldiers and twentyseven other european captives who had latelybeen brought in from the hill forts were lodged in the village thatcolonel knox had first occupied on crossing the river and had allbeen released by him</s>  some of these had been in tippoos hands formany years and their joy at their unexpected release was unspeakable</s> preparations were now made for the siege</s>  general abercrombie wasordered up with a force of six thousand men but before his arrivallieutenant chalmers was sent in with a letter from tippoo asking forterms of capitulation</s>  negotiations were indeed entered into butdoubting tippoos good faith the preparations for the siege werecontinued and upon the arrival of general abercrombies force on the15th of february siege operations were commenced at the end of theisland still in british possession</s> a few days afterwards the army was astounded at hearing that theconditions had been agreed upon and that hostilities were to cease atonce</s>  so great was the indignation indeed that a spirit ofinsubordination and almost mutiny was evinced by many of the corps</s> they had suffered extreme hardships had been engaged in most arduousmarches had been decimated by fever and bad food and they couldscarce believe their ears when they heard that they were to hold theirhands now that after a years campaigning seringapatam was at theirmercy and that the man who had butchered so many hundred englishcaptives who had wasted whole provinces and carried half a millionpeople into captivity who had been guilty of the grossest treacheryand whose word was absolutely worthless was to escape personalpunishment</s> still higher did the indignation rise both among officers and menwhen the conditions of the treaty became known and it was discoveredthat no stipulation whatever had been made for the handing over of theenglish prisoners still in mysore previous to a cessation ofhostilities</s>  this condition at least should have been insisted uponand carried out previous to any negotiations being entered upon</s> the reasons that induced lord cornwallis to make this treaty whenseringapatam lay at his mercy have ever been a mystery</s>  tippoo hadproved himself a monster unfitted to live much less to rule and thecrimes he had committed against the english should have been punishedby the public trial and execution of their author</s>  to conclude peacewith him now was to enable him to make fresh preparations for warand to necessitate another expedition at enormous cost and great lossof life</s>  tippoo had already proved that he was not to be bound eitherby treaties or oaths</s>  and lastly it would have been thought that asa general lord cornwallis would have wished his name to go down toposterity in connection with the conquest of mysore and the captureof seringapatam rather than with the memorable surrender of yorktown the greatest disaster that ever befell a british army</s> the conditions were in themselves onerous and had they been imposedupon any other than a brutal and faithless tyrant might have beendeemed sufficient</s>  tippoo was deprived of half his dominions whichwere to be divided among the allies each taking the portions adjacentto their territory</s>  a sum of 3300000 pounds was to be paid for theexpenses of the war</s>  all prisoners of the allied powers were to berestored</s> two of tippoos sons were to be given up as hostages</s>  even after theyhad been handed over there were considerable delays before tippoossignature was obtained and it was not until lord cornwallisthreatened to resume hostilities that on the 18th of march a treatywas finally sealed</s>  of the ceded territory the mahrattis and the nizameach took a third as their share although the assistance they hadrendered in the struggle had been but of comparatively slight utility</s> it may indeed be almost said that it was given to them as a rewardfor not accepting the offers tippoo had made them of joining with himagainst the british</s> the british share included a large part of the malabar coast with theforts of calicut and cananore and the territory of our ally therajah of coorg</s>  these cessions gave us the passes leading into mysorefrom the west</s>  on the south we gained possession of the fort ofdindegul and the districts surrounding it while on the east weacquired the tract from amboor to caroor and so obtained possessionof several important fortresses together with the chief passes bywhich hyder had made his incursions into the carnatic</s>
dick felt deeply the absence of any proviso in the treaty that allprisoners should be restored previous to a cessation of hostilitiesat the same time admitting the argument of his uncle that althoughunder such an agreement some prisoners might be released there was nomeans of insuring that the stipulation would be faithfully carriedout</s> you see dick no one knows or has indeed the faintest idea whatprisoners tippoo still has in his hands</s>  we do not know how many havebeen murdered during the years tippoo has reigned</s>  men who haveescaped have from time to time brought down news of murders in theplaces where they had been confined but they have known little ofwhat has happened elsewhere</s>  moreover we have learned that certainlyfifty or sixty were put to death at seringapatam before we advancedupon it the first time</s>  we know too that some were murdered in thehill forts that we have captured</s>  but how many remain alive at thepresent time we have not the slightest idea</s>  tippoo might hand over adozen and take a solemn oath that there was not one remaining andthough we might feel perfectly certain that he was lying we should bein no position to prove it</s> the stipulation ought to have been made if only as a matter ofhonour but it would have been of no real efficiency</s>  of course if wehad dethroned tippoo and annexed all his territory we shouldundoubtedly have got at all the prisoners wherever they were hidden</s> but we could hardly have done that</s>  it would have aroused the jealousyand fear of every native prince in india</s>  it would have united thenizam and the mahrattis against us and would even have beendisapproved of in england where public opinion is adverse to furtheracquisitions of territory and where people are of course altogetherignorant of the monstrous cruelties perpetrated by tippoo not onlyupon english captives but upon his neighbours everywhere</s> naturally i am prejudiced in favour of this treaty for the handingover of the country from amboor to caroor with all the passes andforts will set us free at tripataly from the danger of being againoverrun and devastated by mysore</s>  my people will be able to go abouttheir work peacefully and in security free alike from fear ofwholesale invasion or incursions of robber bands from the ghauts</s>  allmy waste lands will be taken up</s>  my revenue will be trebled</s> there is another thing</s>  now that the english possess territory beyondthat of the nabob of arcot and are gradually spreading their powernorth there can be little doubt that before long the whole countryof arcot travancore tanjore and other small native powers will beincorporated in their dominions</s>  arcot is powerless for defence andwhile during the last two wars it has been nominally an ally of theenglish the nabob has been able to give them no real assistancewhatever and the burden of his territory has fallen on them</s>  theytook the first step when at the beginning of the present war theyarranged with him to utilise all the resources and collect therevenues of his possessions and to allow him an annual income for themaintenance of his state and family</s>  this is clearly the first steptowards taking the territory into their own hands and managing itsrevenues and the same will be done in other cases</s> lord cornwallis the other day in thanking me for the services thatyou and i and the troop have rendered promised me that an earlyarrangement should be made by which i should rule tripataly under thegovernment of madras instead of under the nabob</s>  this you see willbe virtually a step in rank and i shall hold my land direct from theenglish instead of from a prince who has become in fact a puppet intheir hands</s> a few days later the army set off on its march from mysore and thesame day the rajah after making his adieus to lord cornwallisstarted with his troop for tripataly making his way by long marchesinstead of following the slow progress of the army</s>  after a couple ofdays at tripataly they went down to madras and brought back therajahs household</s> the meeting between dick and his mother was one of mixed feeling</s>  itwas twenty months since the former had left with his uncle and he wasnow nearly eighteen</s>  he had written whenever there was an opportunityof sending any letters and although his position as interpreter onthe staff of the general had relieved her from any great anxiety onhis account she was glad indeed to see him again</s> upon the other hand the fact that as the war went on and fortressafter fortress had been captured no news came to her that her hopeshad been realised and that the war had now come to a terminationwithout the mystery that hung over her husband being in any waycleared up had profoundly depressed mrs</s>  holland and it was withmingled tears of pleasure and sorrow that she fell on his neck on hisreturn to madras</s> you must not give way mother dick said as she sobbed out herfears that all hope was at an end</s>  remember that you have neverdoubted he was alive and that you have always said you would know ifany evil fate had befallen him and i have always felt confident thatyou were right</s>  there is nothing changed</s>  i certainly have notsucceeded in finding him but we have found many prisoners in some ofthe little outoftheway

believethat he is still alive i shall continue to search for him</s>  i have noother object in life at present</s>  it will be quite soon enough for meto think of taking up the commission i have been

herself up to thepleasure of his return</s>  they had found everything at tripataly as theyhad left it for the mysore horsemen had not penetrated so far northbefore tippoo turned his course east to

will come in time to reach apoint that it will be safe for you to begin your attempt</s> do not watch only the peasants</s>  there is no saying that it may not benecessary to take to other disguises</s>  observe the traders thesoldiers and even the fakirs</s>  you will see that they walk each with adifferent mien</s>  the trader is slow and sober</s>  the man who wears asword walks with a certain swagger</s>  the fakir is everything by turnshe whines and threatens he sometimes mumbles his prayers andsometimes shrieks at the top of his voice</s> when you are not riding or shooting lad do not spend your time inthe garden or with the women</s>  go into the town and keep your eyesopen</s>  bear in mind that you are learning a lesson and that your lifedepends upon your being perfect in every respect</s> as to your first disguise i will speak to rajbullub and he will getit ready by tomorrow evening</s>  the dress of the peasant of mysorediffers little from that here save that he wears rather more clothingthan is necessary in this warm climate</s> chapter 10 in disguise</s> on the following evening dick appeared in the room where the otherswere sitting in the dress rajbullub had got for him and which wassimilar to that of other peasants</s>  the boys had already been told thathe was shortly going on a journey and that it would be necessary forhim to travel in disguise but had been warned that it was a matterthat was not to be spoken of to anyone</s>  the early respect thatdicks strength and activity had inspired them with had been muchshaken when they discovered that he was unable either to ride orshoot but their fathers narrative of his adventures when scoutingwith surajah had completely reinstated him in their high opinion</s> when he entered however they burst out laughing</s>  the two ladiescould not help smiling and dick was not long before he joined in thelaugh against himself</s>  he had felt uncomfortable enough when hestarted in an almost similar dress with surajah although there wasthen no one to criticise his appearance</s>  but now in the presence ofhis mother and aunt he felt strangely uncomfortable</s> never mind dick his uncle said encouragingly</s>  the boys wouldfeel just as uncomfortable as you do now if they were dressed up ineuropean fashion</s>  now while we are talking make your first attemptat sitting on your heels</s> dick squatted down until his knees nearly touched his chest and amoment later lost his balance and toppled over amid a roar oflaughter</s>  next time he balanced himself more carefully</s> that is right dick</s>  you will get accustomed to it in time</s>  but youmust see already that there is a good deal more to be done than youthought of before you can pass as a native</s>  remember you must notonly be able to balance yourself while sitting still but must be ableto use your handsfor cooking purposes for example for eating orfor doing anything there may be to donot only without losing yourbalance but without showing that you are balancing yourself</s> it is much more difficult than i thought uncle</s>  of course i havealways seen the natives squatting like this but it seemed so naturalthat it never struck me it was difficult at all</s>  i say it isbeginning to hurt already</s>  my shin bones are aching horribly</s> yes that is where the strain comes my boy</s>  but you have got tostick to it until your muscles there which have never been calledinto play in this way before get accustomed to the work</s> i understand that uncle</s>  it was just the same with my arms when ibegan to climb</s>  but i cant stand this any longer</s>  i can no more getup than i can fly and dick rolled over on to his side</s> again and again he tried after a short rest between each trial</s>  as hegave it up and limped stiffly to the divan he saidi feel as if some one had been kicking me on the shins until he hadnearly broken them mother</s>  i have been kicked pretty badly severaltimes in fights by rough fellows at home in shadwell but it neverhurt like this and he rubbed his aching legs ruefully</s> well uncle i am very much obliged to you for putting me up topractising this position</s>  it seemed to me that it would be quite asimple thing to walk along quietly and to move my arms about as theydo but i never thought of this</s> i wonder mother you never told me that above all things i shouldhave to learn to squat on my heels for any time</s>  it would not havebeen so difficult to learn it five or six years ago when i was notanything like so heavy as i am now</s> it never once occurred to me dick</s>  i wish it had</s>  i thought i hadforeseen every difficulty but it never once came into my mind thatin order to pass as a native you must be able to sit like one</s> ah well i shall learn in time mother dick replied cheerfully</s> every exercise is hard at first but one soon gets accustomed to it</s> dick threw himself with his usual energy into his new work</s>  althoughof a morning when he first woke his shins caused him the most acutepain he always spent half an hour in practice</s>  afterwards he wouldsit for some time allowing the water from the tap at the side of thebath to flow upon the aching muscles</s>  then he would dress and as soonas breakfast was over go for a run in the garden</s>  at first it was buta shamble but gradually the terrible stiffness would wear off and hewould return to the house comparatively well</s> of an evening the practice was longer and was kept up until theaching pain became unendurable</s>  at the end of four or five days hewas scarcely able to walk at all but after that time mattersimproved and three weeks later he could preserve the attitude forhalf an hour at a time</s> in other respects his training had gone on uninterruptedly every day</s> he went out into the town accompanied sometimes by rajbullubsometimes by surajah in the disguises of either a peasant a soldieror a trader and learnt to walk and carry himself in accordance withhis dress</s>  before putting on these disguises he painted himself witha solution that could easily be washed off on his return to thepalace where he now always wore a european dress</s> you cannot be too careful the rajah said</s>  there are of coursemohammedans here and for aught we know some may act as agents orspies of tippoo just as the english have agents and spies in mysore</s> were one of them to send word that you had taken to indian attire andthat it was believed that you were about to undertake some mission orother it would add considerably to your difficulties and dangers</s>  asit is no one outside our own circle ever sees you about with me orthe boys except in your european dress and rajbullub tells me thatin no single instance while you have been in disguise has anysuspicion been excited or question asked by the people of variousclasses with whom you and he converse in the streets</s> another month passed and by this time dick could without any greatfatigue squat on his heels for an hour at a time</s>  as the date for hisdeparture drew near his mother became more and more nervous andanxious</s> i shall never forgive myself if you do not come back she said oneday when they were alone</s>  i cannot but feel that i have beenselfish and that really on the strength of a conviction which mostpeople would laugh at as whimsical and absurd i am risking thesubstance for a shadow and am imperilling the life of my only boyupon the faint chance that he may find my husband</s>  i know that evenyour uncle although he has always been most kind about it andassisted in every way in his power has but little belief in thesuccess of your search although as he sees how bent i am upon it hesays nothing that might dash my hopes</s> if evil comes of it dick i shall never forgive myself</s>  i shall feelthat i have sacrificed you to a sort of hallucination</s> i can only say mother dick replied that i came out here andentered into your plans only because i had the most implicit faiththat you were right</s>  i should now continue it on my own account evenif tomorrow you should be taken from me</s>  of course i see plainlyenough that the chances are greatly against my ever hearing anythingof father but from what has taken place during the campaign i haveseen that there must be many british captives still hidden away amongthe hill forts and it is quite possible he may be among them</s>  i donot even say that it is probable but the chances are not so verygreatly against it and even if i thought they were smallermuchsmaller than i believe them to bei should still consider it my dutyto go up and try and find him</s>  so even if it should happen that inever come back again you will not have yourself to blame for it isnot you that are sending me but i who am going of my free will andindeed i feel it so much my duty that even were you to turn roundnow and ask me to stay i should still think it right to undertakethis mission</s> but indeed mother i see no great danger in it in fact scarcelyany danger at allat any rate unless i find father</s>  if i do sothere might certainly be risk in attempting to get him away but thisif i am lucky enough in discovering him will not weigh with me for aninstant</s>  if i do not find him it seems to me that the risk is a merenothing</s>  surajah and i will wander about enlisting in the garrisonsof forts</s>  then if we find there are no prisoners there we shall takean early opportunity of getting away</s>  in some places no doubt ishall be able to learn from men of the garrison whether there areprisoners without being forced to enter at all for although in thegreat forts like savandroog and outradroog it is considered soimportant the defences should be kept secret that none of thegarrison are allowed to leave until they are discharged as too old forservice there is no occasion for the same precaution in the case ofless important places</s>  thus you see we shall simply have to wanderabout keeping our eyes and ears open and finding out either fromthe peasants or the soldiers themselves whether there are anyprisoners there</s> i wish i could go with you dick</s>  i used to think that when the workof searching for your father had begun i could wait patiently for theresult but instead of that i find myself even more anxious and morenervous than i was at shadwell</s> i can quite understand mother that it is very much more tryingwork sitting here waiting than it is to be actively engaged</s>  theonly thing is that you must promise me not to trouble more than youcan help for if i think of you as sitting here fretting about me ishall worry infinitely more than i otherwise should over anydifficulties we may have to encounter</s>  you must remember that i shallhave surajah with me</s>  he is a capital companion and will always beable to advise me upon native business</s>  he is as plucky as a fellowcan be and i can trust him to do anything just as i would myself</s> the preparations for departure now began in earnest</s>  there was somediscussion as to the arms that were to be taken but at last it wasdecided that with safety they could carry nothing beyond amatchlock a pistol and a sword each</s> great pains were taken in the selection of the matchlocks</s>  in thearmoury were several weapons of high finish with silver mountingsthat had belonged to the rajahs father and grandfather</s>  these weretried against each other and the two that were proved to be the mostaccurate were chosen</s>  dick found indeed that at distances up to ahundred yards they were quite equal to the english rifle he hadbrought out</s>  the silver mountings were taken off and then the piecesdiffered in no way in appearance from those in general use among thepeasantry</s> the pistols were chosen with equal care</s>  the swords were of finelytempered steel the blades being removed from their jewelled handlesfor which were substituted rough handles of ordinary metal</s> ten gold pieces were sewn up underneath the iron bands encircling theleathern scabbard as many under the bosses of their shields and fivepieces in the soles of each of their shoes</s>  in their waist sashes theordinary receptacle of money each carried a small bag with nativesilver coins</s> at last all was ready and an hour before daybreak dick took acheerful farewell of his mother and a hearty one of his uncle andwith surajah passed through the town and struck up into the hills</s> each carried a bag slung over his shoulder well filled withprovisions a small water bottle and hung upon his matchlock achange of clothing</s>  in the folds of his turban dick had a packet ofthe powder used for making dye so that he could at any time renewthe brown shade when it began to fade out</s> for a time but few words were spoken</s>  dick knew that although hismother had borne up bravely till the last she would break down assoon as he left her and the thought that he might never see her againweighed heavily upon him</s>  surajah on the contrary was filled withelation at the prospect of adventures and dangers and he was silentsimply because he felt that for the present his young lord was in nohumour for speech</s> as soon as the sun rose dick shook off his depression</s>  they were nowa considerable distance up the hillside</s>  there was no path for thepeople of tripataly had no occasion to visit mysore and still lessdesire for a visit from the mysoreans</s>  periodically raids were madeupon the villages and plains by marauders from the hills but thesewere mostly by the passes through the ghauts thirty or forty milesleft or right from the little state which nestling at the foot of thehills for the most part escaped these visitationswhich now thatthe british had become possessed of the territories and the hillshad it was hoped finally ceased</s>  nevertheless the people werealways prepared for such visits</s>  every cultivator had a pit in whichhe stored his harvest except so much as was needed for his immediatewants</s>  the pit was lined with mats others were laid over the grain</s> two feet of soil was then placed over the mats and after the groundhad been ploughed there was no indication of the existence of thehiding place</s> the town itself was surrounded by a wall of sufficient strength towithstand the attacks of any parties of marauders and the custom ofkeeping a man on a watch tower was still maintained</s>  at the foot ofthe tower stood a heavy gun whose discharge would at once warn thepeasants for miles round of an enemy calling those near to hasten tothe shelter of the town while the men of the villages at a distancecould hurry with their wives and families to hiding places among thehills</s> dick and surajah had no need of a path for they were well acquaintedwith the ground and had often wandered up nearly to the crest of thehills in pursuit of game</s>  an hour before noon they took their seatsunder a rock that shaded them from the suns rays and sitting downpartook of a hearty meal</s>  there was no occasion for haste and theyprepared for rest until the heat of the day was passed</s> we are fairly off now surajah dick said as he stretched himselfout comfortably</s>  i have been thinking of this almost as long as i canremember and can hardly believe that it has come to pass</s> i have thought of it but a short time my lord</s> no no surajah dick interrupted</s>  you know it was arranged thatfrom the first you were to call me purseram for unless you getaccustomed to it you will be calling me my lord in the hearing ofothers</s> i had forgotten surajah replied with a smile and then went on</s>  itis but a short time since i was sure i was going with you but i haveever hoped that the time would come when instead of the dull work ofdrilling men and placing them on guard i might have the opportunityof taking part in war and adventure and indeed had thought of askingmy lord your uncle to permit me to go away for a while in one of thecompanys regiments and there to learn my business</s>  since the englishhave become masters and there is no longer war between rajah andrajah as there used to be in olden times this is the only way that aman of spirit can gain distinction</s>  but this adventure is far betterfor there will be much danger and need for caution as well ascourage</s> dick nodded</s> more for caution and coolness than for courage i think surajah</s>  itwill only be in case we find my father or if any grave suspicionfalls on us that there will be need for courage</s>  once well intomysore i see but little chance of suspicion falling upon us</s>  we haveagreed that we will first make for seringapatam avoiding as much aspossible all places on the way where inquiries whence we come may bemade of us</s>  once in the city we shall be safe from such questionsand can travel thence where we will and it will be hard if we do notwhen there manage to learn the places at which any prisoners theremay be are most likely to be kept</s> besides my father is as likely to be there as anywhere for tippoomay since our army marched away have ordered all prisoners to bebrought down from the hill forts to seringapatam</s> when the sun had lost its power they proceeded on their way again</s> their start had been timed so that for the first week they wouldhave moonlight and would therefore be able to travel at night untilthey arrived at seringapatam</s>  it was considered that it was onlynecessary to do this for the first two or three nights as after thatthe tale that they were coming from a village near the frontier andwere on their way to join tippoos army would seem natural enough toany villagers who might question them</s> they continued their course until nearly midnight by which time theywere both completely fatigued and choosing a spot sheltered bybushes lay down to sleep</s>  it took another two days before they wereclear of the broken country and the greater portion of this part ofthe journey they performed in daylight</s>  occasionally they saw in thedistance the small forts which guarded every road to the plateau</s>  tothese they always gave a very wide berth as although according tothe terms of peace they should all have been evacuated they mightstill be occupied by parties of tippoos troops</s> indeed all the news that had arrived since the army leftrepresented tippoo as making every effort to strengthen his army andfortresses and to prepare for a renewal of the war</s> several times they saw bears which abounded among the ghauts andonce beheld two tigers crossing a nullah</s>  they had however othermatters to think of and neither the flesh nor the skins of the bearswould have been of any use to them</s>  the work was severe and they wereglad when at last they reached the level country</s>  in some of the uppervalleys opening on to this they had seen small villages</s>  near one ofthese they had slept and as in the morning they saw that theinhabitants were hindoos they fearlessly went out and talked withthem in order to gain some information as to the position of theforts and to learn whether any bodies of tippoos troops were likelyto be met with</s> they found the people altogether ignorant on these matters</s>  they weresimple peasants</s>  their whole thoughts were given to tilling theirland and bringing in sufficient to live upon and to satisfy thedemands of the tax gatherers when they visited them</s>  they had littlecommunication with other villages and knew nothing of what waspassing outside their own</s>  they evinced no curiosity whateverconcerning their visitors who bought from them some cakes of groundragee which formed the chief article of their food</s> the country through which they passed on emerging from the hills waslargely covered with bush and jungle and was very thinly populated</s> it was an almost unbroken flat save that here and there isolatedmasses of rock rose above it</s>  these were extremely steep andinaccessible and on their summits were the hill forts that formed soprominent a feature in the warfare of both mysore and the nizamsdominions to the north</s>  these forts were for the most partconsidered absolutely impregnable but the last war with the britishhad proved that they were not so as several of the strongest had beencaptured with comparatively slight loss</s> whenever they passed within a few miles of one of these hillfortresses dick looked at it with anxious eyes for there for aughthe knew his father might be languishing</s> after two days walking across the plain they felt that there was nolonger any necessity for concealment except that it would be as wellto avoid an encounter with any troops</s>  although therefore theyavoided the principal roads they kept along beaten paths and did nothesitate to enter villages to buy food</s> they no longer saw caste marks on the foreheads of the inhabitants</s> the hindoos had been compelled by force to abandon their religion allwho refused to do so being put to death at once</s>  dick and surajahfound that their dialect differed much more from that of the countrybelow the ghauts than they had expected and although they had nodifficulty in conversing with the peasants they found that their ideathat they would be able to pass as natives of one of these villageswas an altogether erroneous one</s> this will never do surajah dick said as they left one of thevillages</s>  we shall have to alter our story somehow for the firstperson we meet in seringapatam will see that we are not natives ofmysore</s>  we must give out that we come from some village far down onthe ghautsone of those which have been handed over to the english bythe new treaty</s>  you know the country well enough there to be able toanswer any questions that may be asked</s>  we must say that desiring tobe soldiers and hating the english raj we have crossed the hills totake service of some sort in mysore</s>  this will be natural enough andof course there are many mohammedans down in the plains especiallyamong the villages on the ghauts</s> i think that would be best purseram</s> there is one comfort dick went on</s>  it is evident that tippoo ishated by all the hindoos</s>  he has forced them to change their religionand we need have no fear of being betrayed by any of them except frompressure or from a desire to win tippoos goodwill</s> yes that might be the case with those who are fairly well off butwould scarcely be so among the poorer classes</s>  besides even theywere we living among them would have no reason for suspecting ourstory</s>  there seems no doubt from what they say that tippoo ispreparing for war again and i think that we shall do well as soon aswe enter the city to change our attire or we might be forced intojoining the army which would be the last thing we want</s>  what i shoulddesire above all things is to get service of some kind in thepalace</s> after six days travel they saw the walls of seringapatam</s>  dick hadmade many inquiries at the last halting place as to the position ofthe fords on that side of the town and learned that only thoseleading to the fort were guarded</s>  the ford opposite the town wasfreely open to traffic and could be crossed without question bycountry people although a watch was kept to see that none of the verynumerous prisoners escaped by it</s> it was here therefore that they crossed the river the water beinglittle more than knee deep</s>  no questions were asked by the guard asthey passed their appearance differing in no way from that of thepeasants of the neighbourhood</s> after a quarter of a miles walk they entered the town</s>  it was openand undefended by a wall</s>  the streets were wide and laid out at rightangles</s>  the shops however were poor for the slightest appearance ofwealth sufficed to excite the cupidity of tippoo or his agents andthe possessor would be exposed to exorbitant demands which if notcomplied with would have entailed first torture and then death</s> the streets however presented a busy appearance</s>  they were throngedwith soldiers</s>  battalions of recruits passed along and it was evidentthat tippoo was doing all in his power to raise the strength of hisarmy to its former level</s>  they wandered about for some time and atlast in a small street dick went up to an old man whose face pleasedhim</s>  he was standing at the door of his house</s> we desire to find a room where we can lodge for a time he said</s> can you direct us where we can obtain one</s> you are not soldiers</s>  the old man asked</s> no</s>  we desire to earn our living but have not yet decided whether tojoin the army</s> you are from the plains</s>  the native said sharply in their owndialect</s> that is so dick replied</s> and yet you are mohammedans</s> every one is mohammedan here</s> ah</s>  because it is the choice of death or mohammed</s>  how comes itthat two young men should voluntarily leave their homes to enter thistigers den</s>  you look honest youths</s>  how come you here</s> i trust that we are honest dick said</s>  we have assuredly notventured here without a reason and that reason is a good one butthis is not a city where one talks of such matters to a stranger inthe street even though his face tells one that he can be trusted witha secret</s> the old man was silent for a minute then he saidcome in my sons</s>  you can as you say trust me</s>  i have a room thatyou can occupy</s> they followed him into the house and he led them into a small room atthe back</s>  it was poorly furnished but was scrupulously clean</s>  a panof lighted charcoal stood in one corner and over this a pot of ricewas boiling</s> i bid you welcome he said gravely</s> and as the salutation was not one in use by the mohammedans dick sawthat his idea that the old man was a hindoo who had been forced toabjure his religion was a correct one</s>  the old man motioned to themto take their seats on the divan</s> i do not ask for your confidence he said but if you choose togive it to me it will be sacred and it may be that poor as i am iam able to aid you</s>  i will tell you at once that i am a native ofconjeveram and of course a hindoo</s>  i was settled as a trader atmysore the old capital</s>  but when four years ago the tyrantdestroyed that town i with over a hundred thousand of our religionwas forced to adopt mohammedanism</s>  i was of high caste and like manyothers would have preferred death to yielding had it not been that ihad a young daughter and for her sake i lived and moved here frommysore</s> i gained nothing by my sin</s>  i was one of the wealthiest traders inthe whole city and i had been here but a month when tippoos soldiersburst in one day</s>  my daughter was carried off to the tigers haremand i was threatened with torture unless i divulged the hiding placeof my money</s> it was useless to resist</s>  my wealth was now worthless to me andwithout hesitation i complied with their demands and all i had wasseized save one small hoard which was enough to keep me thus to theend of my days</s>  my wants are few a handful of rice or grain a dayand i am satisfied</s>  i should have put an end to my life were it notthat according to our religion the suicide is accursed andmoreover i would fain live to see the vengeance that must some dayfall upon the tyrant</s> after what i have said it is for you to decide whether you think ican be trusted with your secret for i am sure it is for no slightreason that you have come to this accursed city</s> dick felt that he could safely speak and that he would find in thisnative a very valuable ally</s>  he therefore told his story withoutconcealment</s>  except that an exclamation of surprise broke from hislips when dick said that he was english the old man listened withouta remark until he had finished</s> your tale is indeed a strange one he said when he had heard thestory</s>  i had looked for something out of the ordinary but assuredlyfor nothing so strange as this</s>  truly you english are a wonderfulpeople</s>  it is marvellous that one should come all the way from beyondthe black water to seek for a father lost so many years ago</s>  methinksthat a blessing will surely alight upon such filial piety and thatyou will find your father yet alive</s> were it not for that i should deem your search a useless one</s> thousands of englishmen have been massacred during the last ten years</s> hundreds have died of disease and suffering</s>  many have been poisoned</s> many officers have also been murdered some of them here but more inthe hill forts for it was there they were generally sent when theirdeaths were determined upon</s> still he may live</s>  there are men who have been here as many yearsand who yet survive</s> then this is where the main body of the prisoners were kept</s>  dickasked</s> yes</s>  all were brought here native and english</s>  tens of thousands ofboys and youths swept up by tippoos armies from the malabar coastand the carnatic were brought up here and formed into battalions andthese english prisoners were forced to drill them</s>  it was but a poordrill</s>  i have seen them drilling their recruits at conjeveram and thedifference between the quick sharp order there and the listlesscommand here was great indeed</s>  consequently the englishmen werepunished by being heavily ironed and kept at starvation point for theslackness with which they obeyed the tyrants orders</s>  sometimes theywere set to sweep the streets sometimes they were beaten till theywell nigh expired under the lash</s>  often would they have died ofhunger were it not that tippoos own troops took pity on them andsupplied them from their store</s> some of the boys drummer boys or ships boys or little shipsofficers were kept in the palace and trained as singers and dancersfor tippoos amusement</s>  very many of the white prisoners were handedover to tippoo by admiral sufferin</s>  though how a christian could havebrought himself to hand over christians to this tiger i cannotimagine</s> others were captured in forays and there were till lately manysurvivors of the force that surrendered in hyders time</s>  there arecertainly some in other towns for it was the policy of hyder as itis of tippoo always to break up parties of prisoners</s>  many were sentto bangalore some to burrampore and very many to the fort ofchillembroom but i heard that nearly all these died of famine anddisease very quickly</s> while tippoo at times considers himself strong enough to fight theenglish and is said to aim at the conquest of all southern india hehas yet a fear of englishmen and he thus separates his captiveslest if they were together they should plot against him and bringabout a rising</s>  he knows that all the old hindoo population areagainst him and that even among the mohammedans he is very unpopular</s> the chelah battalions who numbered twelve or fourteen thousand madeup entirely of those he has dragged from their homes in districtsdevastated by him would assuredly have joined against him were therea prospect of success just as they seized the opportunity to desertsix months ago when the english attacked the camp across the river</s> now if you will tell me in what way i can best serve you i will doso</s>  in the first place sturdy young peasants are wanted for the armyand assuredly you will not be here many days before you will findyourselves in the ranks whether you like it or not for tippoo is inno way particular how he gets recruits</s> chapter 11 a useful friend</s> i agree with you that it would be a disadvantage to go as a soldierdick said after a pause but what disguise would you recommend us tochoose</s> that i must think over</s>  you both look too straight and active to beemployed as the assistants of a trader or i could have got some of myfriends to take you in that capacity</s>  the best disguise will be agayer attire such as would be worn by the retainers of some of thechiefs and were it not that if questioned you could not say who wasyour employer that is what i should recommend</s> i saw a number of men working at a battery they are erecting by theriver side</s>  could we not take service there until something betterpresents itself</s> i should not advise that the native replied for the work is veryhard and the pay poor</s>  indeed most of those employed on it are mendriven in from the country round and forced to labour getting onlyenough pay to furnish them with the poorest food</s>  there would also bethe disadvantage that if you were so employed you would have noopportunity of seeing any english captives who may have been broughthere of late</s> all that i can at present do myself is to speak to some of myfriends who have been here for a long time and ask them whether theycan remember an english captive being sent up here from coorg someeight years ago and whether they ever heard what was his fate</s>  ishould say of course that i have received a message from friends atconjeveram that some of the mans relations have sent out to makeinquiries concerning him and asking me if i can find any news as tohis fate</s>  my friends may not know themselves but they may be able tofind out from others</s>  very many of our people were forced into theranks of the army and there is not a regiment which has not some menwho although regarded as mohammedans are still at heart as we allare as true to our faith as ever</s> it is from these that we are more likely to obtain information thanin any other way</s>  you will not be very long before you will be able tosatisfy yourself as to whether or not he whom you seek is in thiscity and if he should not be here there remain but the two townsthat i have named and the hill forts</s>  as to these it will bewellnigh impossible to obtain an entrance so jealously are they allguarded</s>  none save the garrisons are allowed to enter</s>  the pathswhich are often so steep and difficult that men and provisions have tobe slung up in baskets are guarded night and day and none areallowed to approach the foot of the rocks within musket shotlest isuppose they might find some spot where an ascent could be made</s>  thegarrisons are seldom changed</s>  the soldiers are allowed to take theirwives and families up with them but once there they are as muchprisoners as those in the dungeons</s>  that is one reason why captivesonce sent up there never come down again for were they to do so theymight if by chance they escaped be able to give information as tothe approaches that would assist an assailing force</s> i do not say that all are killed though undoubtedly most of them areput to death soon after they arrive but it may be that some areretained in confinement either from no orders being sent for theirexecution or from their very existence being in time forgotten bythe tyrant here</s>  some of these may languish in dungeons others mayhave gained the goodwill of the commanders of the fortfor even amongthe mohammedans there are doubtless many good and merciful men</s> now for the present</s>  this house has but one storey in front butthere is a room over this and that is at your service</s>  furniture ithas none but i will this evening get a couple of trusses of straw</s> it is but a loft but you will not want to use it save to sleep in</s> you need not fear interruption in this house</s>  there is scarce a manhere that is not like myself a hindoo for when we were brought herefrom mysore the piece of ground on which the street stands wasassigned to

agreed</s>  a good juggler couldgain admission to the palace and might even enter forts where noothers could set foot for life there is dull indeed and anyone whocould amuse the soldiers would be certain of a welcome and even agovernor might be willing to see his feats</s> could one bribe a conjurer to let one pass as his assistant</s> that would be impossible the hindoo said for an assistant

of it dick said one could have bought inlondon very many things which would have seemed almost magical to thepeople here</s>  i am afraid that we must go on on our old line</s>  it is apity for the

accompany tippoo onhis march</s>  you will of course account for your dialect by keeping toyour present story that you came from a village on the ghauts inorder to enter the service of one of our rajahs and that your fatherhaving years ago been a soldier in the pay of the rajah of bohr youmade your way there direct instead of coming to the capital</s> that will do excellently pertaub</s>  it

steel cap with a drooping plume of redhorsehair and a red tunic with a blue sash</s>  over it was worn a skirtof linked mail which with leggings fitting tightly completed thecostume</s>  surajah had a red turban a jerkin of quilted leather withiron scales fastened on to protect the shoulders and chest</s>  a scarletkilt hung to his knees and his legs were enclosed in putties orswathes of coarse cloth wound round and round them</s>  he wore a blueand gold girdle</s> dick laughed as he surveyed the appearance of himself and surajah</s> we are a rumlooking couple he said but i have seen plenty ofmen just as gaudy in the train of some of the rajahs who visited thecamp when we were up here</s>  i think that it is a much better disguisethan the one we wore yesterday</s>  i shant be afraid that the firstofficer we meet will ask us to what regiment we belong</s>  there werescores of fellows lounging about in the streets last night dressed aswe are</s> sticking their swords and pistols into their girdles they salliedout and were pleased to find that no one paid the slightest attentionto them</s>  they remained in the town until some battalions of recruitspoured out from the fort to drill on the grounds between it and thetown</s>  the first four that passed were as dick learnt from the remarksof some of the bystanders composed entirely of boyssome of themchristians thirty thousand of whom had been carried off by tippoo inhis raid on travancore and the young men were compelled to serveafter being obliged to become nominally mohammedans</s>  after thechelah battalions came those of tippoos army</s> these fellows look as if they could fight dick said</s>  they are anirregular lot and dont seem to have an idea of keeping line ormarching in step but they are an activelooking set of fellows andcarry themselves well</s>  as to the chelahs i should say they would beno good whatever even if they could be relied on which we know theycannot be</s>  they look dejected and miserable and i suppose hate it allas much as their officers do</s>  i should back half a regiment of englishto lick the twelve battalions</s>  i wonder tippoo himself does not seethat troops like these must be utterly useless</s> i dont expect he thinks they would be of much use surajah agreed</s> he only turned them into soldiers to gratify his hatred of them</s> leaving the troops they walked on and entered the great fort whichenclosed an area of nearly two square miles</s>  in this were tippoospalace his storehousescontaining grain sufficient for the garrisonfor a siege of many monthsmosques the residences of tippoosofficials and officers the arsenals and the huts for the troops</s> there was also a street of shops similar to those in the town</s> wandering about unquestioned they came

naked from the waist up</s>  his back wascovered with blood and he had evidently been recently flogged untilhe fell insensible</s>  half a dozen savagelooking men evidentlyexecutioners of tippoos

my hopes of liberty for ten minutes face to face with you withswords in our hands</s> they would not be of much use to us the other said quietly</s>  it isfour days since we had a mouthful of food and they would make veryshort work of us</s> all the better the other exclaimed</s>  death would be a thousandfoldpreferable to this misery</s> dick felt that if he remained longer he would be unable to containhimself and turning hastily away walked off accompanied by surajah</s> it is awful</s>  he exclaimed with tears running down his cheeks andto be able to do nothing</s>  what must father have gone through</s>  i thinksurajah that if we were to come upon tippoo i should go for him evenif he were surrounded by guards</s>  of course it would cost me my life</s> if i could kill him i think i should not mind it</s>  such a villain isnot fit to live and at any rate whoever came after him theprisoners could not be worse off than they are now</s> let us go back</s>  i have had enough for this morning</s> when they returned dick told pertaub of the scene that he hadwitnessed</s> many of them have been starved to death the old man said</s>  possiblyone of their companions may have tried to escape</s>  it is to preventthis that tippoos greatest cruelties are perpetrated</s>  it is not sovery difficult to get away and take to the jungle</s>  some havesucceeded but most of them are retaken for a watch is vigilantlykept up at every village and every road leading on to the frontierand if caught they are hung or forced to take poison</s>  but whetherthey are caught or not tippoos vengeance falls upon theircompanions</s>  these are flogged ironed and kept without rations forweeksliving if they do live upon the charity of their guards</s> this is why there are so few attempts at escape</s>  a man knows thatwhether he himself gets off or not he dooms his companions totorture perhaps death</s>  one case i remember in which an englishsailor one out of nine attempted to get away</s>  he was captured andkilled at once and his eight companions were all hung</s>  so you seeeven if one of the captives sees a chance of escape he does not takeit because of the consequences that would fall upon his companions</s> it is horrible dick said and i can quite understand why so fewescape</s>  the question for me now is whether there are any prisonerskept in dungeons here</s> not here i think</s>  tippoos policy is to make all his captivesuseful and though one might be ironed and confined for a time i donot think that any are so kept permanently here</s>  there were ofcourse some confined to the fort by illness and some in irons</s>  itmay need some little search before you are quite sure that you haveseen every one</s>  however i will try to find out how many there arethere and to get as many of the names as possible</s>  some of myfriends who keep shops in the fort may be able to do this for me</s> this would shorten your task</s> but i cannot hold out any hopes that you will find him whom you seekin the city</s>  it is among the hill forts you will find him if he bealive</s>  i have been turning the matter over since you spoke to me lastnight and the best plan i can think of is that you should go as atravelling merchant with surajah as your assistant</s>  you would want agood assortment of goods fine muslins and silks and a good selectionof silver jewellery from different parts of india</s>  all these i couldpurchase for you here</s>  if by good luck you could obtain a sight ofthe commander of one of these forts you might possibly obtainpermission from him to go up and show your wares to the ladies of hisestablishment and to those of other officers</s>  the present of ahandsome waist sash or a silvermounted dagger might incline himfavourably to your petition</s> i think that the idea is an excellent one dick said warmly</s>  if wecannot get in in that way there seems to me to be no chance save bytaking a careful survey of the fortress to discover where the rockscan be most easily climbed</s>  there must surely be some spots evenamong the steepest crags where active fellows like surajah and myselfwould be able to scale them</s>  of course we should have to do it afterdark but once up there one ought to be able to move about in thefort without difficulty as we should of course be dressed assoldiers and could take dark blankets to wrap round us</s>  we ought thento be able to find where any prisoners who may be there are confined</s> there might be a sentry at the door or if there were no other wayone might pounce upon someone force him by threats to tell us whatprisoners there are and where they are confined and then bind andgag him and stow him away where there would be no chance of his beingdiscovered before daylight</s> there would be a terrible risk in such a matter pertaub saidshaking his head gravely</s> no doubt there would be risk but we came here prepared to encounterdanger and if it were well managed i dont see why we should befound out</s>  even if we were we ought to be able to slip away in thedarkness and make our way to the point where we went up</s>  once down onthe plain we could renew our disguise as traders and however hotlythey scoured the country pass without suspicion through them</s> i think that there will be more chance in that way than in going inas traders for we should in that case have little chance of walkingabout still less of questioning anyone</s>  however it is worth tryingthat first</s>  we can always fall back upon the other if it fails</s>  wemight on our first visit obtain indications that would be veryuseful to us on our second</s> chapter 12 a tiger in a zenana</s> another week passed and by the end of that time dick was perfectlyassured that his father was not at seringapatam</s>  it was then aquestion which of the hill forts to try first</s>  pertaub had alreadyprocured for them an assortment of goods and dresses suitable fortravelling merchants and the purchase of these things had drawnheavily on their stock of money although several of the traders onreceiving a hint from pertaub of the purpose for which the goods wererequired had given many articles without charge while for themajority of the goods dick gave an order on his mother who had toldhim that he could draw up to five hundred pounds</s> on the day before they were about to start their plans wereinterrupted by the issue of a proclamation saying that sports withwild beasts would take place on the following day and they agreedthat as one day would make no difference they would stop to seethem especially as tippoo himself would be present</s>
 hithertoalthough they had several times seen him being carried in hispalanquin they had had no opportunity of observing him closely as hewas always surrounded by his guards</s> the sports were held in a great square in the fort</s>  a strong networkwas erected in a semicircle of which the palace formed the base</s> behind the network the spectators ranged themselves</s>  tippoo occupieda window in the palace looking down into the square</s>  there werealways a number of wild beasts in seringapatam available for thesepurposes as a regular supply of tigers leopards and wild elephantswas caught and sent in every month</s>  six of the largest tigers werealways kept in cages in the courtyard in front of the palace and tothese were thrown state criminals or officials who had offended thetyrant and were devoured by them</s> in his younger days tippoo had been very fond of the chase but hewas now too fat and heavy and seldom ventured on horseback</s> dick and surajah who had arrived early had placed themselves at thecorner where the network touched the palace</s>  some thirty yards infront of them a balcony projected</s>  it was enclosed by a thick latticework</s>  from behind this the ladies of tippoos harem viewed thesports</s> these began with a contest of fighting rams</s>  the animals were placedsome fifty yards apart</s>  as soon as they saw each other both showedextreme anger uttering notes of defiance</s>  then they began to movetowards each other at first slowly but increasing in speed untilwhen within a few yards of one another each took a spring meeting inmid air forehead to forehead with a crash that could be heard faraway</s>  both fell back and stood for a moment shaking their heads asif half stupefied with the blow</s>  then they backed two steps andhurled themselves at each other again</s>  after this had been repeatedonce or twice they locked forehead to forehead and each strove topush the other back</s> for some time the struggle continued on equal terms</s>  then the weakerbegan to give way and was pushed back step by step until itsstrength failed altogether and it was pushed over on to the groundwhen the attendants at once interfered and separated them</s> some thirty pairs of rams fought the affair being to dick extremelymonotonous</s>  the natives however took great interest in the contestswagering freely on the issues shouting loudly to the combatants andraising triumphant cries when one was adjudged victor</s> then elephants were brought in but the struggle between these waseven tamer than between the rams</s>  they pushed each other with theirforeheads until one gave way when the other would follow it beatingit with its trunk and occasionally shoving it</s> when this sport was over two parties of men entered the arena amid ashout of satisfaction from the crowd</s>  after prostrating themselvesbefore tippoo they took up their ground facing each other</s>  each manhad on his right hand four steel claws fixed to the knuckles</s> approaching each other cautiously they threw with their left handsthe garlands of flowers they wore round their necks into the faces oftheir opponents trying to take advantage of the moment to strike ablow or to obtain a grip</s>  each blow laid open the flesh as by atigers claws</s>  the great object was to gain a grip no matter wherewhich would completely disable the opponent and render him incapableof defending himself</s>  when this was done the combat between that paircame to an end</s> after the ghetties as these men were named had retired a buffalowas matched against a tiger</s>  the latter was averse to the contest butupon some firecrackers being thrown close behind him he sprang at thebuffalo who had been watching him warily</s>  as the tiger launcheditself into the air the buffalo lowered its head received it on itssharp horns and threw it a distance of ten yards away</s>  no effortscould goad the wounded tiger to continue the fray so it and thebuffalo were taken out and two others brought in</s> the second tiger was a much more powerful beast than its predecessorand was indeed larger than any of those in the cages of the palace</s> it had been captured four days before and was full of fight</s>  itwalked round the buffalo three or four times and then with the speedof lightning sprang upon it breaking its neck with a single blowfrom its powerful forepaw</s>  six buffaloes in succession were broughtin and were killed one after the other by the tiger</s> satisfied with what it had done the tiger paid no attention to theseventh animal but walked round and round the arena looking for ameans of escape</s>  then drawing back it made a short rush and sprangat the net which was fourteen feet high</s>  strong as were the polesthat supported the net it nearly gave way under the impact</s>  the tigerhung ten feet above the ground until some of the guards outside ranup discharging their muskets into the air when it recommenced itspromenade round the foot of the net roaring and snarling with anger</s> as it neared the palace it stopped and uttered a roar of defiance atthose at the windows</s>  then apparently something moving behind thelattice work caught its eye</s>  it moved towards it crouching and thenwith a tremendous spring launched itself against it</s> the balcony was ten feet from the ground but the tigers spring tookit clear of this</s>  the woodwork gave way like paper and the tigerburst through</s>  a shout of dismay arose from the multitude but highabove this sounded the screams of the women</s> quick surajah</s>  dick cried and drawing his keen dagger he cutthrough the network and dashed through followed by his companion</s> stand here he cried as they arrived below the balcony</s>  steady</s> put your hands against the wall</s> then he sprang on to surajahs back and thence to his shoulder</s> drawing his pistols he put one between his teeth grasping the otherin his right hand</s> steady surajah he said</s>  i am going to stand on your head</s> he stepped on to his companions turban put his left arm on thebalcony and raised himself by it until his arms were above itslevel</s>  the tiger was standing with its paw upon a prostrate figuregrowling savagely but evidently confused and somewhat dismayed at thepiercing screams from the women most of whom had thrown themselvesdown on the cushions of the divan</s> dick stretched his right hand forward took a steady aim and fired</s>  asharp snarl showed that the shot had taken effect</s>  he dropped thepistol snatched the other from his mouth waited for a moment untilhe could make out the tiger fired again and at once dropped to theground just as a great body flashed from the window above him</s> he and surajah had both had their matchlocks slung over theirshoulders and before the tiger could recover from its spring theylevelled and fired</s>  the tiger rolled over but regained its feet andmade towards them</s>  one of the bullets had however struck it on theshoulder and disabled the leg</s>  its movements were thereforecomparatively slow and they had time to leap aside</s>  surajahdischarged his pistol into its ear while dick brought down his keensword with all his strength upon its neck and the tiger rolledover dead</s> a mighty shout rose from the crowd</s> we had better be off dick said or we shall have all sorts ofquestions to answer</s> they slipped through the hole in the net again but were so surroundedby people cheering and applauding them that they could not extricatethemselves and a minute later some soldiers ran up pushed throughthe crowd to them and surrounded them</s> the sultan requires your presence they said and as resistance wasout of the question dick and surajah at once accompanied them to theentrance of the palace</s> they were led through several large halls until they entered the roomwhere tippoo was standing</s>  he had just left the womens apartmentwhere he had hurried to ascertain what damage had been done by thetiger</s>  dick and his companion salaamed to the ground in accordancewith the custom of the country</s> you are brave fellows the sultan said graciously and all thebraver that you risked death not only from the tiger but for daringto look upon my women unveiled</s> i saw nothing your highness dick said humbly save the tiger</s> that he was standing over a fallen figure i noticed</s>  as soon as my eyefell on him i fired at once and the second time as soon as the smokecleared so that i could catch a glimpse of him</s> i pardon you that tippoo said and in faith you have rendered megood service for had it not been for your interference he might haveworked havoc in my harem and that before a single one of my officersor men had recovered his senses and he looked angrily round at theofficers standing near him</s> how comes it that you were so quick in thought and execution</s>  heasked surajah as the elder of the two</s> my brother and myself have done much hunting among the hills yourhighness and have learned that in fighting a tiger one needs to bequick as well as fearless</s> whence come you</s>  tippoo asked</s>  by your tongue you are strangers</s> surajah gave the account that they had agreed upon as to theirbirthplace but he was quickwitted enough to see that it would not besafe to say they were in the service of the rajah of bhor asinquiries might be made and he therefore saidwe came hither to take service either with your royal highness orwith one of your rajahs but have as yet found no opportunity of doingso</s> it is well tippoo said</s>  henceforth you are officers in my service</s> apartments shall be assigned to you in the palace</s> here is the first token of my satisfaction and he took out a heavypurse from his girdle and handed it to surajah</s>  you are free to gonow</s>  i will later on consider what duties shall be assigned to you</s> when you return report yourselves to fazli ali my chamberlain andhe indicated a whitebearded official among the group standing besidehim</s> salaaming deeply again they left the apartments</s>  not a word wasspoken until they were outside the precincts of the palace</s> this makes a sudden change in our plans dick said</s>  whether forbetter or worse i cannot say yet</s> i was right in not saying we were in the service of the rajah ofbhor was i not</s>  i thought that tippoo would offer to take us into hisservice and he might have caused a letter to be sent to the rajahsaying that he had done so</s> yes you were quite right surajah</s>  i had thought of that myself andwas on thorns when you were telling your story and felt not a littlerelieved when you changed the tale</s>  i think that it has turned out forthe best</s>  as officers of the palace we may be able to obtain someinformation as to what christian captives there are and the prisonswhere they are confined</s> still more surajah said when we get to be known as being hisofficers we might present ourselves boldly at any of the hillfortresses as sent there with some orders</s> you are right dick said</s>  i had not thought of that</s>  indeed wemight even produce orders to inspect the prisoners in order to renderan account to tippoo of their state and fitness for service and mighteven show an order for my father to be handed over to us if we shouldfind him</s>  this is splendid and i am sure i cannot be too grateful tothat tiger for popping into the harem</s>  he has done more for us in afew minutes than we could have achieved in a year</s> well surajah if my father is alive i think now that we have everychance of rescuing him</s> as they walked through the streets many of those who had been presentat the sports recognised them as the heroes in the stirring episodethere and judging they would gain a high place in tippoos favourcame up to them and congratulated them on their bravery and madeoffers of service</s>  they replied civilly to all who accosted them butwere glad when they turned off to the quiet quarter where pertaublived</s>  the hindoo was surprised indeed when they told him what hadhappened and that they were already officers in the palace and mightconsider themselves as standing high in tippoos favour</s> it is wonderful he said when they brought their story to aconclusion</s>  surely providence must have favoured your pious object</s> such good fortune would never have occurred to you had it not beenthat it was destined you should find your father still alive</s>  but ifgood fortune befalls you it is because you deserve it</s>  that youshould face a great tiger without hesitation and slay him shows howfirm your courage is and the quickness was still more to be admired</s> no doubt there are many others there who to gain the favour of thesultan would have risked their lives but you alone of them werequick enough to carry it out</s> we were nearest to the spot pertaub</s>  had we been among the crowdfarther back we could have done nothing</s> let praise be given where it is due surajah said</s>  i had nothing todo with the affair</s>  i saw the tiger bound through the window andheard screams and stood frozen with horror</s>  i did not even see mylord cut through the net</s>  i knew nothing until he seized me by thearm and pulled me after him and it was not until he sprang upon myback and then upon my shoulders that i knew what he was going to do</s> i simply aided in despatching the tiger when he sprang wounded downinto the courtyard</s> and yet you are a hunter and a soldier pertaub said</s>  this is howit is that the english have become lords of so wide a territory</s>  theyare quick</s>  while we hesitate and spend great time in making up ourminds to do anything they decide and act in a moment</s>  they are alwaysready we are always slow</s>  they see the point where a blow has to bestruck they make straight to it and strike</s> the english sahib is very young and yet to him comes in a momentwhat is the best thing to be done</s>  he does not stop to think of thedanger</s>  while all others stand in consternation he acts and slaysthe tiger before one of them has so much as moved from his place</s> but indeed as you say tippoo himself told you your danger was notonly from the tiger</s>  the tyrant must indeed have been alarmed forthe safety of his harem when he forgave you what in the eyes of amohammedan is the greatest offence you can commit</s> this will of course change all of your plans</s> for the present at any rate</s>  it may be that later on we shallstill find occasion for our disguises as possibly we may fall intodisfavour and have to assume them to make our escape</s>  we may astippoos officers manage to obtain entrance into one or two of thehill fortresses but unless absolutely sent by him that is the utmostwe could hope for for were we missing messengers would be sent allover the country to order our arrest and in that case we should haveto take to some disguise</s> the first thing now is to procure our dresses</s>  how much is there inthat purse surajah</s>  it seems pretty heavy</s> surajah poured the gold out on the table</s> there are fifty tomauns</s>  that will be more than enough to clothe youhandsomely the hindoo said</s> much more than enough i should think pertaub</s> tippoo likes those round him to be well dressed</s>  it is not only aproof of his generosity but he likes to make a brave show on greatoccasions and nothing pleases him more than to be told that neitherthe nizam nor any other indian prince can surpass him in themagnificence of his court</s>  therefore the better dressed you are themore he will be satisfied for it will seem to him that you appreciatethe honour of being officers of the palace and that you have laid outhis present to the best advantage and have not a mind to hoard any ofit</s> i will take the matter in hand for you</s>  you will need two suits onefor court ceremonies and the other for ordinary wear in the palace</s> i shall be very much obliged to you pertaub for indeed i have noidea what ought to be got</s>  had we better present ourselves at thepalace this evening or tomorrow morning</s> this evening certainly</s>  did he take it into his head to inquirewhether you were in the palace and found that you were not it mightalter his humour towards you altogether</s>  he is changeable in hismoods</s>  the favourite of one day may be in disgrace and ordered toexecution the next</s>  you will soon feel that it is as if you were in areal tigers den and that the animal may at any moment spring uponyou</s> take with you the clothes you now wear and those in which you cameso that at any moment if you see a storm gathering you can slip on adisguise and leave the palace unobserved</s>  in that case hasten hereand you can then dress yourselves as merchants</s> the worst of it is pertaub that our faces will soon become known toso many in the palace that they would be recognised whatever ourdress</s> a little paint and some false hair and a somewhat darker stain toyour skin would alter you so that those who know you best would passyou without suspicion</s>  i trust that no such misfortune will befallbut i will keep everything in readiness to effect a transformationshould it be required</s> now i will go out at once to get the clothes</s> in two hours he returned followed by a boy carrying the goods he hadpurchased and in a few minutes dick and his companion were arrayedin court dresses</s>  the turbans were pure white and the tunic was ofdark rich stuff thickly woven with gold thread</s>  a short cloak ormantle secured at the neck by a gold chain three or four inches inlength hung from the back but could if necessary be drawn roundthe shoulders</s>  a baldric embroidered with gold crossed the chestand from this hung a sword with an ivory handle</s> the waist sash was of blue and gold in dicks case purple and gold inthat of surajah</s>  silvermounted pistols and daggers were stuck intothe sashes</s>  the dresses were precisely alike except that theydiffered in colour</s>  the trousers were white</s> surajah was greatly delighted with his dress</s>  dick laughed</s> of course it comes naturally to you he said but i feel as if iwere dressed up for a masquerade</s> the other suits were similar in style but the tunics were ofrichlyfigured damask instead of cloth of gold</s> half an hour later they started for the palace a coolie carrying abox containing their second suits and the simple dresses they hadworn on their arrival</s>  dick could not help smiling at the manner inwhich the people in the streets obsequiously made way for them</s> i shall be very glad he said as they traversed the space thatdivided the town from the fort when we have got over the next day ortwo and have settled down a bit</s>  it all seems so uncertain and ihave not the most remote idea of what our duties are likely to be</s> hitherto we have always had some definite plan of action and hadonly ourselves to depend upon</s>  now everything seems doubtful anduncertain</s>  however i suppose we shall soon settle down and we havethe satisfaction of knowing that if things do not turn out well wecan go off to our good friend pertaub and get out of the placealtogether</s> on arriving at the palace they inquired for the chamberlain</s> he is expecting you my lord one of the attendants said comingforward</s>  i will lead you first to the room that is prepared for youand then take you to fazli ali</s> the room was a commodious one and the richness of the covering of thedivan and the handsome rugs spread on the floor were satisfactorysigns that the chamberlain considered them prime favourites of thesultan</s>  having seen the box placed in a corner and paid the cooliethey followed the attendant along some spacious corridors andpassages until they entered a room where fazli ali was seated on adivan</s>  the attendant let the curtains that covered the door dropbehind them as they entered</s> they salaamed to the chamberlain who looked at them approvingly andmotioned to them to take their seats on the divan beside him</s> i see he said kindly that you possess good judgment as well ascourage and quickness</s>  the former qualities have won you a place herebut judgment will be needed to keep it</s>  you have laid out your moneywell as the sultan loves to see all in the palace well attired andquiet also and discreet in behaviour</s> can you give us any idea what our duties will be</s>  surajah asked asdick had requested him always to be the spokesman if possible</s> the chamberlain shook his head</s> that will be for the sultan himself to decide</s>  for a time probablyyou will have little to do but to attend at the hours when he givespublic audiences</s>  you will doubtless occasionally carry his ordersto officers in command of troops at distant places and will formpart of his retinue when he goes beyond the palace</s>  when he sees thatyou are worthy of his favour prompt in carrying out his orders andin all respects trustworthy he will in time assign special duties toyou but this will depend upon yourselves</s> as one who admires the courage and promptness that you showed todayand who wishes you well i would warn you that it is best when thesultan has had matters to trouble him and may blame somewhatunjustly not to seek to excuse yourselves</s>  it is bad to thwart himwhen he is roused</s>  you can rely upon me to stand your friend and whenthe storm has blown over to represent the matter to him in afavourable light</s>  the sultan desires to be just and in his calmmoments assuredly is so but when there is a cloud before his eyesthere is no saying upon whom his displeasure may fall</s> at present however there is little chance of your falling intodisgrace for he is greatly impressed with the service you haverendered him and especially by the promptness with which you carriedit out</s>  after you had gone he spoke very strongly about it and saidthat he would he were possessed of a hundred officers capable of sucha deed</s>  he would in that case have little fear of any of the foes ofhis kingdom</s> it is fortunate that you came here this afternoon</s>  it is wellnighcertain that he will ask for you presently and though he could hardlyblame you had you required until tomorrow to complete yourpreparations your promptitude will gratify him and he will i amsure be still more pleased at seeing that you have so well laid outhis gift</s>  he gave you no orders on the subject and had you appearedin the dresses you wore this morning he would doubtless haveinstructed me to provide you with more suitable attire</s>  the fact thatyou have so laid out the money will show that you have anunderstanding of the honour of being appointed to the palace and aproper sense of fitness</s>  the sultan himself dresses plainly and savefor a priceless gem in his turban and another in his sword hiltthere is nothing in his attire to lead a stranger to guess at hisrank</s>  but while he does this himself he expects that all others inthe palace should do justice to his generosity</s> and now you had best return to your room and remain there untilsent for</s>  if he does not think of it himself i shall if opportunityoccurs inform him that you have already arrived</s> they had some difficulty in finding their way back to their room andhad indeed to ask directions of attendants they met before theydiscovered it</s>  a native was squatting at the door</s>  he rose andsalaamed deeply as they came up</s> your slave is appointed to be your attendant my lords he said</s> your servants name is ibrahim</s> good surajah said as he passed him and entered the room</s>  nowibrahim tell us about the ways of the palace for of these we arealtogether ignorant</s>  in the first place about food</s>  do we provideourselves or how is it</s> all in the palace are fed from the sultans kitchen</s>  at each mealevery officer has so many dishes according to his rank</s>  these varyfrom three to twelve</s>  in the early morning i shall bring you breadand fruit and sherbet at ten oclock is the first meal and at seventhere is supper</s>  at one oclock the kitchens are open and i can fetchyou a dish of pillau kabobs a chicken or any other refreshment thatyou may desire</s>  at present i have no orders as to how many dishesyour excellencies will receive at the two meals</s> we shall not be particular about that surajah said</s>  it is evidentwe shall fare well at any rate</s> i am told to inform you my lords that the sultan has ordered twohorses to be placed at your service</s>  a ghorrawalla has been appointedto take charge of them</s>  his name is serfojee</s>  if you ask for him atthe stable you will be directed to him and he will show you thehorses</s> in an hour supper will be served but this evening i shall only beable to bring you three dishes each</s>  such is always the rule untilthe sultans pleasure has been declared</s> ibrahim then proceeded to light two lamps hanging from the ceilingfor it was now getting dusk and then finding that his masters had nofurther need of his services he retired</s> so far so good surajah</s>  we are certainly in clover as far ascomfort is concerned and the only drawback to the situation istippoos uncertain temper</s>  however we must try our best to satisfyhim</s>  we have every reason to stand well with him and if he sees thatwe are really anxious to please him we ought to be able to avoidfalling into disgrace even when he is in his worst moods</s> their attendant presently brought up the six portions of food andthey enjoyed their meal heartily</s>  each had an ample portion of apillau of rice and chicken a plate of stew which dick thought wascomposed of game of some kind and a confection in which honey was thepredominating flavour</s>  with this they drank water deliciously cooledby being hung up in porous jars</s> surajah ate his food with the dexterity of long habit but dick hadnot yet learned to make his bread fulfil the functions of spoon andfork for at his uncles table european methods of eating wereadopted</s> half an hour after they had finished an officer presented himself atthe door and said that he was ordered to conduct them to the sultan</s> tippoo had supped in the harem and was now seated on a divan in aroom of no great size but richly hung with heavy silken curtains andcarpeted with the richest rugs</s>  two or three of his chief officerswere seated beside him</s>  seven or eight others were standing on eitherside of the room</s>  a heavy glass chandelier of european manufacturehung from the richly carved ceiling and the fifty candles in itlighted up the room</s> the chamberlain met them at the door and advanced with them towardstippoo</s> great sultan he said these are the young men whom it has pleasedyour highness to appoint officers in the palace</s> the two lads salaamed until their turbans touched the ground</s> truly they are comely youths tippoo said and one would scarcelydeem them capable of performing such a feat as that they accomplishedthis morning</s> well my slayers of tigers you have found everything fitlyprovided</s> far more so than our deeds merit your highness surajah replied</s> we have found everything that heart could desire and only hope foran opportunity to show ourselves worthy of your favours</s> you have done that beforehand tippoo said graciously and i amglad to see by your attire that you are conscious that as myofficers it is fitting you should make a worthy appearance</s>  it showsthat you have been well brought up and are not ignorant of what isright and proper</s> at present you will receive orders from fazli ali and will act asassistant chamberlains until i decide in what way your services canbe made most useful</s> now follow me</s>  there are others who wish to see you</s> rising tippoo led the way through a door with double hangings into aroom considerably larger than that which they had just left</s>  thechandeliers at the end of the room where they stood were alllighted while the other end was in comparative darkness</s> leaving them standing alone tippoo walked towards the other end andclapped his hands</s>  immediately a number of closely veiled figuresentered completely filling the end of the room</s> these are the young men tippoo said to them</s>  it is the one on theright to whom it is chiefly due that the tiger did not commit havocamong you</s>  it was he who climbed up the balcony and fired twice atthe beast</s>  you owe your lives to him and his companion for among allmy officers and guards there was not one who was quickwitted enoughto move as much as a finger</s> there was a faint murmur of surprise among the veiled figures at theyouth of their preserver</s> hold your heads fully up tippoo went on for dick and hiscompanion after making a deep salaam had stood with bent heads andwith eyes fixed upon the ground</s> then two of the attendants girls of thirteen or fourteen years oldcame forward from behind the others each bearing a casket</s> these are presented to you with my permission by the ladies whoselives you saved tippoo said and should you at any time have afavour to ask or even should you fall under my displeasure you canrely upon their good offices in your behalf</s> there was another low murmur from the other end of the hall</s>  thentippoo clapped his hands and the women moved out as noiselessly asthey had entered</s> you can retire now tippoo said as he moved towards the door intothe other room</s>  be faithful be discreet and your fortune isassured</s> he pointed to another door and then rejoined his councillors</s> dick and his companion stood in an attitude of deep respect until thehanging had fallen behind the sultan and then went out by the door hehad pointed to and made their way back to their own room</s> truly surajah fortune is favouring us mightily</s>  this morning wewalked the streets in fear of being questioned and arrested</s>  thisevening we are officers of the palace favoured by tippoo and underthe protection of the harem</s> i wonder what the ladies have given us</s> they opened the caskets which were of considerable size</s>  as theyexamined the contents exclamations of surprise broke from them</s>  eachcontained some thirty or forty little parcels done up in paper andon these being opened they were found to contain trinkets and jewelsof all kinds</s>  some were very costly and valuable</s>  all were handsome</s> it was evident that every one of the ladies who had been in the roomwhen the tiger burst in had contributed a token of her gratitude</s> many of the more valuable gems had been evidently taken from theirsettings as if the donors did not care that jewels they had wornshould be exposed to view</s>  one parcel contained twenty superb pearlsanother a magnificent diamond and ten rubies and so on down to themore humble giftsalthough these were valuableof those of lowerrank</s> dicks presents were much more costly than those of his companion andas soon as this was seen to be the case dick proposed that theyshould all be put together and divided equally</s>  this howeversurajah would not hear of</s> the whole thing is due to you he said</s>  it would never haveoccurred to me to interfere at all</s>  i had no part in the matterbeyond aiding to kill a wounded tiger and it was no more than i havedone many times among our hills and thought nothing of</s>  thesejewels are vastly more than i deserve for my share in the affair</s>  ido not know much about the value of gems but they must be worth alarge sum and nothing will induce me to take any of those that youhave so well earned</s> i wonder whether tippoo knows what they have given us dick saidafter in vain trying to alter his companions decision</s> i dont suppose he troubled himself about it surajah replied</s>  nodoubt he was asked for permission for each to make a present to us</s> the jewels in the harem must be of enormous value as for the lastfifteen years tippoo has been gathering spoil from all southernindia having swept the land right up to the gates of madras</s>  they saythat his treasures are fabulous and no doubt the ladies of his haremhave shared largely in the spoils</s>  the question is what had we bestdo with these caskets</s>  we know that in the course of our adventuresit may very well happen that we shall be closely searched and itwould never do to risk having such valuables found upon us</s> no i should say that we had best bury them somewhere</s>  some of thesemerchants here may be honest enough for us to leave the jewels intheir care without anxiety but as they themselves may at anymoment be seized and compelled to give up their last penny thesethings would be no safer with them than with us</s> as to pertaub i have absolute faith in him but he himself is liableto be seized at any moment</s>  however i should say we had betterconsult him</s>  if we were to bury them say under the floor of hishouse we might leave them there for a time</s>  if we saw any chance ofthis place being someday captured by our people we could wait tillthen for their recovery</s>  but the war may not be renewed for years</s> possibly pertaub may be able to arrange to send them down onlyentrusting a portion at a time to a messenger so that if he got intotrouble we should only lose what he had upon him</s> we will put the caskets into our box and lock it up for the presentand take them down to pertaub tomorrow evening after it gets dark</s>  itwill be as well to get them off our minds as soon as possible foralthough just at present we are in high favour there is no saying howlong it may last or when it may be necessary for us to move</s> chapter 13 officers of the palace</s> the next morning just as they had finished their early breakfastthey were sent for by fazli ali</s> you had better accompany me on my rounds he said</s>  i shall notcommit any special duties to you until i see whether the sultanintends that you shall remain with me or whether as is far morelikely he assigns other work to you</s>  were you placed in separatecharges in the palace i should have to fill your places if you left</s> therefore i propose that at present you shall assist me in generalsupervision</s> we will first go to the kitchens</s>  these give me more trouble than anyother part of my duties</s>  in the first place one has to see that thecontractors do their work properly that the number of carcases sentin is correct the flesh of good quality and that the list of game iscorrect</s>  then one has to check the amount of rice and other grain sentin from the storehouses the issue of spices and other articles ofthat kind</s>  these matters do not require doing every day</s>  the kitchenofficers are responsible for them but once or twice a week i takecare to be present to see that all is right</s>  then i ascertain thateverything is in good and proper order in the kitchen listen tocomplaints and decide disputes</s> when we have done there we will see that the requisitions from theharem are properly complied with and that the sweetmeats perfumessilks and muslins as required are furnished</s> the payment of salaries does not come into my department</s>  that is oneof the functions of the treasurer of the palace who also dischargesall accounts upon my signature that they are correct</s> then i take a general tour of the palace to see that the attendantshave done their duties and that everything is clean and in order</s>  asa rule i have finished everything before the morning meal is served</s> the details of making up the accounts are of course done by clerks</s> after that my duties depend entirely upon the sultan</s>  if there isany state ceremonial in the palace i summon those whose duty it is toattend and see that everything is properly arranged and in order</s>  ifnot i am generally at his highnesss disposal</s> unless you receive any instructions from me you will be free tooccupy yourselves as you like</s>  you will of course take part in allpublic ceremonials</s>  you will be among the officers who accompany thesultan when he goes out and will be liable to be summoned to attendhim at all times</s>  therefore although free to go into the town orride beyond the island it is well that you should never be longabsent and that if you wish to be away for more than two hours at atime you should first let me know as i may be able to tell you ifthe sultan is likely to require you</s>  he has fixed your pay at fourhundred rupees a month</s> dick as he accompanied the chamberlain on his tour through thepalace was struck with the order and method that prevailed in everydepartment and the chamberlain told him that tippoo himselfinquired closely into details and that large as was the dailyexpenditure no waste of any kind was allowed</s> the splendour of some of the apartments was surprising especially thethrone room</s>  the throne itself was of extraordinary magnificence</s>  itwas of gold thickly inlaid with gems</s>  on the apex stood a jewelledpeacock covered entirely with diamonds emeralds and rubies withpendants of pearls</s>  in front of it stood a golden tigers head whichserved as a footstool</s>  on either side were standards of purple silkhaving a sun with gold rays in the centre</s>  the spear heads were ofgold set with jewels</s> when the work of inspection was finished they went back to theirroom where their attendant soon afterwards with an air of greatexultation brought their meal which consisted of nine dishes each aproof of the high favour with which tippoo regarded them</s>  after thismeal was eaten they went down to the stables and were pleasedindeed with the mounts provided for them</s>  they were fine animalswith handsome saddles and trappings and dick and surajah at oncemounted and rode through the town to the other extremity of theisland</s>  as they wore scarves that had been furnished them by fazliali showing that they were officers of the palace they wereeverywhere greeted with deep salaams</s> i hope dick said as they returned from their ride that tippoowill not be long before he finds us some other duties</s>  there isnothing very interesting in counting carcases or seeing ricemeasured</s> that is true enough surajah agreed</s>  but we must not be impatient</s> fortune has befriended us marvellously and i have great faith that itwill continue to do so</s>  we must be content to wait</s> yes i know that surajah but i think it is all the more difficultto do so because we have done so much in a short time</s>  it seems as ifone ought to go on at the same rate</s> that evening they went down as they had arranged with ordinary wrapsround their gay attire to pertaubs taking with them the caskets ofgems</s>  the hindoo received them warmly</s> i saw you ride through the streets this morning although you did notnotice me</s>  truly you made a good appearance and were well mounted</s>  ihave heard from one of our people who is a servant in the palacethat you stand in high favour</s> we have brought you down these two caskets of gems dick said</s>  theywere given us by the ladies of the harem and many of the stonessurajah thinks are very valuable</s>  we dont know what to do with themand wanted to know whether you could arrange to send them down totripataly for us</s> i would not undertake to do so if they are valuable pertaub said</s> the prospects of fresh troubles are stronger every day and the roadsare so closely watched especially those through the passes that itwould be running a terrible risk to trust valuables to anyone</s> in that case pertaub we thought you might bury them in the groundunder your house</s>  but first look at some of the stones and tell uswhat you think of them</s> the hindoo opened surajahs casket and undid many of the littleparcels</s> assuredly they are valuable he said</s>  some of them much more sothan others but if all are like these that i have opened they mustbe worth at least fifty thousand rupees</s> now look at this casket pertaub</s> the hindoo uttered an exclamation of surprise as he opened some ofthe packets and taking out some of the larger gems he examined themby the light of his lamp</s> i could not place a value on these he said at last</s>  the ladiesmust indeed have felt that they owed their lives to you</s>  the gemsare a fortune</s>  doubtless they are the spoils of a score of districtsand tippoo must have distributed them lavishly among his wives orthey could never have made such rich presents</s>  i would bury themsahib for surely they could not be entrusted even to the mostfaithful messengers in times like these</s>  but though if you like iwill hide them here i think it would be far safer for you to takethem across the river and bury them in a wood marking well thetrees that you may know the place again for although methinkstippoos agents believe that they have squeezed the last rupee fromme one can never telli might again be tortured and none can saythat they are brave enough to bear the agonies that tippoosexecutioners inflict</s> i will bury them for tonight but i pray you give me notice the firsttime you cross the river</s>  i will be at the other side of the fordwith the jewels hidden in a sack on an ass</s>  this i will drive forwardwhen i see you crossing the ford</s>  you will follow me till i enter awood</s>  i will have the tools and when you join me you can go on ashort distance and bury them</s>  i do not wish to see where you hidethem but will move about to make sure that none come near you whenso engaged</s> you had best take out a few small stones which you will find as goodas money and much more easily concealed for in every town or largevillage you will find a jeweller who will give you silver for them</s> i think that will be a very good plan pertaub and will certainlycarry it out</s> a month passed without any change in their work</s>  they rode withother officers behind tippoos palanquin when he went out which hedid almost every day to inspect the progress of the fortificationsand were among the brilliant circle behind his throne when he gaveorders</s> by this time they had come to know most of the other court officialsand were able to inquire cautiously about the prisons</s>  they couldlearn nothing however of any english prisoners in seringapatam savethose they had seen in the hut in the fort</s> six weeks after their appointment as palace officers dick and surajahwere sent for by tippoo</s> i am about to employ you the sultan said when they appeared beforehim on a mission</s>  you are strangers here and are unconnected withany of my officers and i can therefore place greater reliance onyour reports than upon those of men who have other interests than myown to serve</s>  i desire you to go and inspect the hill forts to seehow the repairs of the fortifications injured by the english areprogressing and to make sure that the cannon are in good order andthe supply of ammunition plentiful</s>  you have shown that you are quicksighted and sharp</s>  look round the defences and if you see aught thatcan be done to strengthen them confer with the governors learn theiropinions on the subject and if they agree with you they will beauthorised to take men from the country round to strengthen thefortifications and i will forward at once such guns and stores asmay be required</s> after the inspection of each fort you will despatch a mountedmessenger to me with your report and you will state which fort youwill next visit in order that i may despatch there any order that imay have to give you</s> do your duty well and i shall know how to reward you</s>  in order thatyour authority may be increased you are both named colonels in thearmy</s>  fazli will furnish you with a written copy of the orders i havegiven you and with authority under my seal to enter and inspect allfortresses and to consult with the governors as to everythingconsidered by them as necessary for their better defence</s> the last time the english came they captured nundidroog and otherhill fortresses that we had regarded as impregnable simply becausethe governors were overconfident and the defences had been neglected</s> this must not occur again and if there is failure in the defences ishall hold you responsible</s>  therefore take care that you do notneglect not only to see that the repairs are being well carried outbut to recommend additions to the fortifications wherever it seems toyou that there is even a possibility of an enemy making his way up</s> you will take with you twenty troopers as an escort but these arenot to enter any of the fortresses with you for treachery is alwayspossible and no one save the garrisons must be acquainted with thedefences of the hill forts</s> surajah expressed his thanks to the sultan for entrusting them withthe mission and assured him that their inspection of the forts shouldbe careful and complete and that they would start in an hours time</s> when they reached their own room dick threw up his turban in delight</s> was there ever such a stroke of good fortune</s>  he exclaimed</s>  thetiger business was as nothing to this</s>  tippoo has given us themission of all others that will enable us to carry out our search</s> our work is as good as done</s> that is to say he added more gravely we are at least pretty sureto find my father out if he is alive</s>  besides we may get informationthat will be of great use if the war is renewed</s> now we had better in the first place go and see fazli and get ourinstructions</s>  we will order our horses to be in readiness to start assoon as we have had our mealwe may not get another chance of eatingtoday</s> i should like to take ibrahim with us</s>  he is a capital servant and astrong active fellow</s>  i believe he is fond of us and we shall wantsomeone who can cook for us and buy things and so on</s>  i will speakto fazli about it</s> the chamberlain looked up as they entered the room where he wasengaged in dictating to a clerk</s> i congratulate you on your mission he said</s>  it will involve agreat deal of hard work but as you have told me how you longed forsome duty outside the palace you will not mind that</s>  tippoo consultedme before sending for you</s>  i told him you were diligent in theservice and i felt sure you would do your best in the present matterand that as you were accustomed in the pursuit of game to ascendmountains and scale precipices you were far more likely to find theweak spots in the forts than an old officer who would be likely totake everything for granted</s> there is no doubt that many of the garrisons are very far from beingefficient</s>  they have been stationed in the forts for many years</s> discipline both among officers and men is sure to have become laxand there will be much that young men going freshly into the matterwill see needs amendment</s>  that the walls are often weak and thecannon so old as to be almost useless i am well aware for sometimesnewlyappointed governors have sent in strong protests and urgentrequests that they might be furnished with new cannon and that wallsand defences might be renewed</s>  but what with the wars the removal ofthe capital and the building and fortification of this place thesematters have been neglected and it is only now that the sultan seesthe necessity of putting the fortifications of all these places ingood repair</s> i have had the papers prepared and signed</s>  your escort has beenordered</s>  is there anything else you can think of</s> we should like to take our palace attendant with us surajah said</s> he is a good man and starting so suddenly we should have adifficulty in hiring servants we could rely on</s> i have thought of that the chamberlain replied and have ordered ahorse to be got in readiness for him together with a spare animal tocarry food and necessaries for your journey</s>  you will need them onyour marches and may even be glad of them in some of the smallerforts where the fare will be very rough</s> when they returned to their room they found ibrahim awaiting them</s>  hewas evidently delighted at the prospect of accompanying them</s> my lords he said i have the pack horse saddled in the stablewith two great sacks and ropes</s>  is it your pleasure that i should godown at once to the market and buy flour and rice spices and otherthings necessary</s> certainly ibrahim</s>  but it will not be necessary to buy much meat</s>  itwill not keep and we ought always to be able to buy a sheep or a fowlfrom villagers</s>  get some thick wadded sleeping rugs some cookingpots and whatever you think is necessary</s>  do not waste any time forwe shall start immediately after our meal</s> as soon as the man had left dick said to surajahi will hurry down to the town and see pertaub</s>  you had best remainhere in case tippoo should send for us to give us final instructions</s> you can say should he ask that i have gone down to the town to get asupply of powder and ball for our pistols writing materials andother things that we may require which will be true enough</s>  it ismost lucky that we buried our jewels in the forest ten days ago forwe should not have had time to do it now</s> dick returned in time for the meal which was brought up by anotherservant</s> pertaub was delighted to hear of our good fortune he said on hisreturn</s>  he will keep our disguises by him and if we have occasionfor them will either bring them himself with the merchandise or willsend them by a trusty messenger to any place we may mention directlyhe hears from us</s>  i do not think there is any chance of our wantingthem but it is as well to prepare for any contingency that mayoccur</s> half an hour later they started at the head of an escort of twentytroopers ibrahim riding in the rear leading the pack horse whichcarried a change of clothes and thick cloths to keep out the nightdews as well as the stock of provisions</s>  ibrahim had also purchasedtwo very large dark blankets that could be used for a temporaryshelter</s>  surajah now felt quite at home for he was engaged in thesame sort of duty he performed at tripataly and more than one pair ofdark eyes glanced admiringly at the two young officers as they rodedown to the ford</s> they had been furnished by fazli with a list of the forts they wereto visit and the order in which they were to take them the first onthe list being savandroog fifty miles northeast of the city</s>  after aride of twenty miles they halted at a village</s>  to the surprise of thetroopers surajah gave orders that nothing was to be taken by forceas he was prepared to pay for all provisions required</s> as soon as the villagers understood this ample supplies were broughtin</s>  rice grain and fowls were purchased for the soldiers and foragefor the horses and after seeing that all were well provided for thetwo officers went to a room that had been placed at their service inthe principal house in the village</s> ibrahim justified his assertion that he was a good cook by turningout an excellent curry</s>  by the time they had finished this it wasgetting dark and after again visiting the troopers and seeing thattheir own horses were fed and well groomed they retired to bed</s> an early start was made and at ten oclock they approachedsavandroog</s>  it was one of the most formidable of the hill forts ofmysore and stood upon the summit of an enormous mass of granitecovering a base of eight miles in circuit and rising in raggedprecipices to the height of 2500 feet</s>  the summit of the rock wasdivided by a deep chasm into two peaks each of which was crowned withstrong works and capable of separate defence</s>  the lower part of thehill was wherever ascent seemed possible protected by walls onebehind the other</s>  the natives had regarded the fort as absolutelyimpregnable until it was stormed by the troops under lord cornwallis</s> dick looked with intense interest at the great rock with its numerousfortifications</s>  the damages committed by the british guns could not beseen at this distance and it seemed to him wellnigh impossible thatthe place could have been captured</s>  they rode on until they neared anentrance in the wall that encircled the fort at the side at whichalone access was considered possible</s> they were challenged as they approached</s>  ordering the troopers toremain behind dick and surajah rode forward</s> we are the bearers surajah cried out as they reined in theirhorses within twenty yards of the gate of an order from the sultanfor our admittance and of a letter to mirzah mohammed bukshy thegovernor</s> i will send up word to him an officer on the wall replied</s>  i canadmit no one until i have received his orders to do so</s> how long will it be before we receive an answer</s> an hour and a half at the earliest</s>  i regret that your excellencieswill be inconvenienced but my orders are absolute</s> i do not blame you surajah replied</s>  it is necessary that youshould always be vigilant and they retired under the shade of atree a hundred and fifty yards from the gate</s> ibrahim spread out the rugs and then proceeded to light the fire andto prepare a pillau of rice and fowl while dick and his companionregarded the rock with fixed attention and conversed together as tothe possibility of ascending at any of the points so steep as to beleft undefended by walls</s>  they concluded at last that it would benext to impossible to climb the rock anywhere on the side that facedthem save by scaling several walls</s> they had just finished their luncheon when the gate opened and anofficer and four soldiers issued out</s>  they at once rose and went tomeet them</s> i have the governors order to admit you on the production of thesultans pass</s> surajah produced the document</s>  the officer at once recognised theseal and carried it to his forehead salaaming deeply</s> your troopers can enter at the gate but cannot proceed farther thanthe second wall</s> can we ride up or must we walk</s>  dick asked</s> you can ride he replied</s>  the road is steep but nowhere so steepthat horses cannot mount it</s> after the party had entered the gate it was at once closed andbolted</s>  the troopers dismounted and were led to a small barrackwhile surajah and dick accompanied by the officer and four soldierson foot rode on</s> the road was a better one than dick had expected</s>  it was just wideenough for a cart to proceed up it and was cut out of the solid rock</s> it turned and zigzagged continually and at each angle was a smallfort whose guns swept the approach</s>  they passed under a score ofgateways each defended by guns and after upwards of an hoursclimbing at a quick pace they approached one of the forts on itssummit</s>  the governor met them at the gate</s> you will pardon my not descending to meet you below he said but iam not so young as i used to be and the journey up and down fatiguesme much</s> dick and surajah dismounted and the former presented the twodocuments</s>  the governor after reading the pass bowed and led theway into the interior of the fort and they were soon seated on adivan in his quarters when he read the circular letter</s> i am glad indeed he said when he had finished that the sultan ispleased to take into consideration the many demands i have made forcannon and ammunition</s>  a large number of the pieces are past serviceand they would be as dangerous to those who fired them as to those atwhom they were aimed while i have scarcely powder enough to furnishthree rounds for each</s>  as to the defences i have done my best tostrengthen them</s>  idleness is bad for all men most of all forsoldiers and i have kept them well employed at repairing the effectsof the english fire</s>  still there is much to do yet before they arefinished and there are points where fortifications might be addedwith advantage</s>  these i will gladly point out to you</s>  they have beenbeyond our means here for as you will perceive it will needblasting in many places to scarp the rock and to render inaccessibleseveral points at which active men can now climb up</s>  for this workpowder is required</s>  and i would submit that for such hard work itwill be needful to supply extra rations to the troops for the presentscale scarcely suffices to keep the men efficient especially as mostof them have their wives and families dependent on them</s> i have no doubt that the sultan will accede to any reasonablerequests your excellency</s>  he is anxious that the walls of the fortsshould be placed in the best possible condition for defence</s>  no onedoubts that we shall ere long be again at war with england andalthough the sultan relies much upon large reinforcements that havebeen promised by france with whom he has entered into an alliancethey have not yet arrived and he may have to bear the brunt of theattack of the english by himself</s> i have heard of this the governor said and regret that we shallagain have the feringhees upon us</s>  as for the mahrattis or the nizami heed them notthey are dust whom the sultan could sweep from hispath but these english are terrible soldiers</s>  i have fought againstthem under hyder and in the last war they again showed their valourand the strangest thing is that they make the natives under them fightas bravely as they do themselves</s> as to forts nothing is safe from them</s>  were all the troops of thenizam and the mahrattis combined to besiege us i should feelperfectly safe while were there but five hundred englishmen i shouldtremble for the safety of the fortress</s>  you have come up the hill andhave seen for yourselves how strong it is and yet they took the placewithout the loss of a single man</s>  i was not here for i was in commandof kistnagherry at that time and succeeded in holding it againsttheir assaults</s>  when the war was over and kistnagherry was ceded tothem i was appointed to this fortress which seems to me to be evenstronger than that was</s> the commander was a brave man the garrison was strong there was nosuspicion of treachery and though at last the troops were seizedwith a panic as they might well be when they saw that they wereunable to arrest the advance of the enemy the defence up to that timehad been stout</s>  the english brought up guns where it was thought noguns could be taken</s>  they knocked the defences to pieces and afterwinning their way to the top in one day captured this fort and thaton the hill yonder</s>  it seems miraculous</s> coffee was brought in and pipes for although tippoo was violentlyopposed to smoking and no one would venture upon the use of tobaccoin the palace or fort old officers like the governor in distantcommands did not relinquish tobacco</s> it is necessary here the governor said as he filled his pipe</s>  thecountry round is terribly unhealthy and the air is full of fever</s>  ido not discourage its use among the men for they would die off likeflies did they not smoke to keep out the bad air</s>  the climate isindeed the best protection to the fort for an army that sat down forany length of time before it would speedily melt away</s> he opened a box that stood on the divan beside him</s> i have copies here he said taking some papers out of thememorials that i have sent in to the sultan as to the guns</s>  this isthe last</s>  it was sent in two months ago</s>  you see i asked forfortynine heavy pieces</s>  of these thirty are to replace guns that arehoneycombed or split</s>  the other eleven are for new works</s>  i asked forthirtytwo lighter ones or howitzers and a hundred wall guns</s>  ofcourse i could do with less but to place the fort in a perfect stateof defence that is the number that i and my artillery officer thinkare requisite</s> of powder we have not more than a ton and a half and if the siegewere to be a long one we might require ten times as much</s>  we have notmore than eight rounds of shot for each gun and we ought to have atleast fifty for the heavy pieces and twenty for those defending thepath up the hill</s> dick made a note of the figures in a pocket book he had bought forthe purpose</s> as for provisions the governor went on we ought to have largestores of rice and grain</s>  the magazines are nearly empty and as wehave eight hundred men in garrison and perhaps twice as many womenand children we should require a large store were we blockaded forany time</s> are the troops in good condition</s>  surajah asked</s> the governor shook his head</s> many of them are past the term of service but until i getreinforcements to supply their places i shall not venture todischarge them</s>  many others are wasted by fever and i must say frominsufficient rations which not only weakens their bodies but lowerstheir spirits</s>  as long as there was no fear of attack this matteredlittle but if the english are coming again we shall want wellfedand contented men to oppose them</s> i see by the stars on your turbans that you are both colonels aswell as officers of the palace</s>  you are fortunate in obtaining thatrank so young</s> it was due to the sultans favour surajah said</s>  the other day atthe sports a tiger burst into the sultans zenana and we were luckyenough to kill itthat is my friend did most of the killing</s>  i onlygave the brute the final coup</s> ah it was you who performed that deed</s>  the governor said warmly</s> i heard the news from one of my officers who was on leave andreturned yesterday</s>  truly it was a gallant action and one quicklydone</s>  no wonder that you obtained the sultans favour and your rankas colonel</s> i was a sportsman in my young days</s>  but i think i should have beenmore frightened at the thought of taking a peep into the sultanszenana than i should have been of fighting the tiger</s> i did not think anything about it dick said until it was allover</s>  i heard some women scream and being quite close went to theirassistance without a thought whether they might be the ladies of thezenana or servants of the palace</s>  but indeed i saw nothing save thetiger and only vaguely observed that there were women there at all</s> it was well that the sultan took the view he did of the matter thegovernor said</s>  i have known men put to death for deeds that were buttrifles in comparison to looking into the zenana</s> now colonel i will send for my artillery officer and the horsesand we will ride round the fortifications on the brow of the hillinspect the two forts closely and will point out to you the spotswhere it appears to us the defences ought to be strengthened</s> chapter 14 a surprise</s> dick was much pleased with the governor</s>  he was evidently an outspokenold soldier and though rough his bearded face had an honest andkindly expression and he thought to himself if my father fell intohis hands i dont think he would be treated with any unnecessaryhardship though no doubt the sultans orders would be obeyed</s> when a soldier came in to say that the horses were at the door theywent out</s>  an officer was standing beside them and the governorpresented him as his chief artillery officer</s> you have not brought your horse he said</s> no your excellency</s>  the distance is not great and we should need todismount so many times to get a view from the walls that it wouldnot be worthwhile to ride</s> in that case we may as well walk also dick said</s> i would rather do so too the governor said</s>  i proposed ridingbecause i thought you might be tired</s>  as bakir meeram says thedistance is not great</s>  the walls themselves with the exception ofthose of the two forts are not more than half a mile in extent forin most places the rocks go sheer down and there defences are ofcourse unnecessary</s>  we will inspect this fort first</s> they went the round of the walls dick and his companion listening tothe suggestions of the two officers</s>  the principal one was that a wallshould be raised inside the gate</s> the english last time got in here by rushing in at the tail of thefugitives from below</s>  they were in before the gates could be closedand took our men so completely by surprise that they were seized witha panic</s>  were we to raise a semicircular wall behind the gateway sucha thing could not occur again the governor said</s>  of course therewould be a gate in the inner wall but not immediately behind theouter gateway as if so placed it might be destroyed by the cannonshots that battered the outer gate in</s>  i should therefore put it atone end of the inner wall</s>  this gate would be generally open but incase of a siege i should have it blocked up with stones piled behindit placing a number of ladders by which men running in could get onto the walls and however closely they were pursued could make astand there until the ladders were pulled up</s> that would be an excellent idea surajah said gravely and i willcertainly lay it before the sultan</s>  i suppose you would propose thesame for the other fort</s> just the same</s> the only thing that i would observe dick said is that if anenemy once got a footing on the top here you could not hope to make along defence of these forts</s> that is so the governor agreed</s>  the strength of the defence is nothere but on the upward road and if the english once gained the topthe forts must fall but at least it shall not be said as long as iam governor that savandroog fell almost bloodlessly</s>  in these fortswe can at least die bravely and sell our lives to the last</s>  it is forthat reason i desire that they shall be so defended that they cannotbe carried as they were before by a sudden rush</s> the other fort was then visited and a tour made round the walls</s>  thesuggestions offered by the governor and the officers were all noteddown and approved</s> then they made what was to dick the most important part of theinspection namely an examination of the undefended portion of therock</s>  the result showed him that the builders of the defences had notacted unwisely in trusting solely to nature</s>  at many points the rockfell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep</s>  at other pointsalthough the descent was less steep it was as far as he could seefrom above altogether unclimbable but this he thought he would beable to judge better from below</s> do you have sentries round here at night</s>  he asked the governor</s> no</s>  it would not be necessary even if an enemy were encamped below</s> if you will ride round the foot of the hill when you leave you willsee for yourself that save from the side you came up the place isabsolutely inaccessible</s> the view from the top of the hill was superb</s>  away to the northeastthe governor pointed out the pagodas of bangalore twentytwo milesaway the distance in the clear air seeming comparatively trifling</s> are there many troops there</s>  dick asked</s> there are about five battalions of the regular troops and threechelah battalions</s>  these can hardly be counted as troops</s>  they havenever been of the slightest use</s>  in the last war they ran like sheep</s> it is a fancy of the sultans</s>  but indeed he can hardly expect mento fight who have been forced into the ranks and made to acceptmohammedanism against their will</s>  naturally they regard an invadernot as an enemy but as a deliverer</s> of course the sultans idea was that since the native troopsdrilled and led by englishmen fought so well the chelahs who werealso drilled and led by englishmen would do the same</s>  but thecompanys troops are willing soldiers and it is the english leadingmore than the english drill that makes them fight</s>  if the chelahswere divided among the hill fortresses they might do good service andi could as far as fighting goes do with a battalion of them herefor mixed up with my men they would have to do their duty</s>  but ofcourse they will never be placed in the hill forts for one wouldnever be safe from treachery</s>  even if all the lower walls were in thehands of my own men some of the chelahs would be sure to manage todesert and give information as to all the defences</s> a considerable portion of the upper plateau of the rock was occupiedby the huts of the troops for the forts were much too small tocontain them and their families</s>  on their way back they passedthrough these</s>  dick looked anxiously about for white faces but couldsee none nor any building that seemed to him likely to be used as aprison</s> when they returned to the governors quarters they found that a roomhad been placed at their disposal and they presently sat down todinner with him</s> i suppose you have no english prisoners here</s>  dick said carelesslywhen the meal was over</s> the governor paused a moment before he replied</s> i dont want any of them here he said shortly</s>  batches are sentup sometimes from bangalore but it is only for execution</s>  i am aloyal subject of the sultan but i would that this work could be doneelsewhere</s>  almost all the executions take place in the hill forts inorder i suppose that they may be done secretly</s>  i obey orders but inever see them carried out</s>  i never even see the captives</s>  they havedone no harm or at most one of their number has tried to escapefor which they are not to be blamed</s>  i always have them shot whetherthat is the mode of execution ordered or not</s>  it is a soldiers deathand the one i should choose myself and so that they are dead it canmatter little to the sultan how they die</s>  if they were all shot assoon as they were taken i should not think so much of it but afterbeing held captive for years and compelled to work it seems to methat their lives should be spared</s>  as far as giving up my own life isconcerned i would willingly do it at the orders of the sultan butthese executions make me ill</s>  i lose my appetite for weeks afterwards</s> let us talk of something else</s> and the governor puffed furiously away at the hookah he had justlighted</s>  then the conversation turned to the forts again</s> no i do not find the life dull he said in answer to a remark ofdicks</s>  i did so at first but one soon becomes accustomed to it</s>  ihave my wife and two daughters and there are ten officers so that ican have company when i choose</s>  all the officers are married and thatgives society</s>  up here we do not observe strictly the rules of theplains and although the ladies of course wear veils when they gobeyond the house they put them aside indoors and the families mixfreely with each other so that we get on very well</s>  you see thereare very few changes ever made and as many of the ladies are like mywife no longer young we treat them as comrades</s> in the morning dick and surajah mounted their horses took a heartyfarewell of the governor and rode down to the gate</s>  a soldier hadbeen sent down half an hour before and they found their escort inreadiness to move</s>  they had decided that before going to the nextfort they would ride round the foot of the hill of savandroog</s>  thisthey did going at a foot pace and scanning the cliffs and slopes asthey passed</s>  sometimes they reined up their horses and rode a littlefarther back so as to have a view to the very summit</s> when they completed the round they agreed that there were but twospots where it seemed to them that an ascent was barely possible andthey were very doubtful whether the difficulties when examined moreclosely would not prove to be absolutely insurmountable</s> that is not a satisfactory outlook dick said but fortunatelythere is now no motive for climbing the precipice</s>
 certainly thoseplaces would be of no use to a party wanting to make an attack</s>  in thefirst place though you and i might get up with soft shoes on i amsure that english soldiers with muskets and ammunition pouches couldnever do it especially at night and in the daytime even if a bodyof troops strong enough to be of any use could get up those who firstarrived at the top would be killed before the others could come totheir assistance and a few stones rolled down would sweep all behindthem to the bottom</s> i dont like turning my back on the place he went on as theyturned their horses heads to the south for savandroog was thefarthest north of the forts they were to visit</s>  it seems to me thateven now my father may be there</s> how can that be dick</s>  surajah said in surprise</s>  nothing could bemore straightforward than the governor seemed to be</s>  i thought that hewas even rash in speaking as frankly as he did to us</s> i think he saw there was no fear of our repeating what he saidsurajah</s>  he is a frank outspoken old soldier and has evidently beenso disgusted at the treatment of the prisoners that he could not mincehis words and yet you know he did not absolutely say that he had noprisoners</s> no i noticed that he did not reply directly to your question</s> on the contrary he distinctly hesitated before he spoke</s>  now whyshould he have done that</s>  he might just as well have said no i haveno prisoners</s>  they are only sent up here for execution</s>  that wouldhave been his natural answer</s>  instead of that he hesitated and thenbegan i dont want any of them here batches are sent up sometimesfrom bangalore</s>  now why did he shirk the question</s>  if it had beenany other subject i might not have noticed that he had not reallyanswered it but of course as it was so important a one i waslistening most anxiously for his reply and noticed his hesitation atonce and that he gave no direct answer at all</s> now think it over surajah</s>  why should he have hesitated and whyshould he have turned the question off without answering it unlessthere had been some reason</s>  and if so what could the reason be</s> surajah had no suggestion to make and they rode on for some distancein silence</s> it is quite evident dick went on after a long pause that he is akindhearted man and that he objects altogether to tippoos crueltyto the prisoners</s>  therefore if he had any captives his reason fornot answering was most likely a kindly one</s> yes i should think so</s> you see he would consider that we should report to the sultan allparticulars we had gathered about the fortress</s>  his remarks about theexecution of the prisoners and the worthlessness of the chelahbattalions and so on was a private conversation and was only amatter of opinion</s>  but supposing he had had some prisoners and hadsaid so we might for anything he knew have had orders to inspectthem and to report about them as well as about the garrisons anddefences</s> yes he might have thought that surajah agreed but after all whyshould he mind that</s> dick did not answer for some time</s>  he was trying to think it out</s> presently he reined in his horse suddenly</s> this might be the reason he said excitedly</s>  this governor may bethe very one who we heard had taken my father with him when he wasmoved from that fort up in the north</s>  he was in command atkistnagherry before he came here after the war and he may have goneto kistnagherry from that fort in the north</s>  you see there have beenexecutions but they have been those of fresh batches sent up and thegovernor would not include the captive he had brought with him</s>  intime his very existence may have been forgotten and he may still beliving there</s>  that would account for the governors objection toanswering the question as he would be sure that did tippoo hearthere was a prisoner there he would send orders for him to beexecuted at once</s> this may be all fancy surajah but i cannot think of any otherreason why he should have shirked my question</s> he took up the reins again and the horse at once started forward</s> they rode for some little time in silence dick thinking the matterover again and again and becoming more and more convinced he wasright except that as he admitted to himself the prisoner whom thegovernor wished to shield might not be his father</s> he was roused at last by surajah asking the question is thereanything that you would like us to do</s> not now dick replied</s>  we could not go back again</s>  we must visitthe other forts on our list and see what we can find out there</s>  whenwe have quite assured ourselves that my father is not in any of themwe can think this over again but at present we must put it aside</s> however i shant rest until i get to the bottom of it</s> during the next ten days they inspected the forts of navandroogsundradroog outradroog and chitteldroog</s>  few of these were asextensive and none so strong as savandroog</s>  they did the officialpart of their business and assured themselves that no englishcaptives were contained in any of them</s>  the governors all said thatprisoners were never kept there many days and that it was only whentippoo wished to get rid of them that they were sent there</s>  none ofthe governors made any objection to answering dicks questions on thesubject generally adding an expression of satisfaction that prisonerswere never left long under their charge</s> it entails a lot of trouble the governor of outradroog said</s>  theyhave to be watched incessantly and one never feels certain they maynot slip away</s>  look at this place</s>  you would think that no one couldmake his escape and yet some ten years ago fourteen of them gotaway from here</s>  they slid down a precipice where no one would havethought a human being could have got down alive</s>  they were all of themretaken except one and executed the following day but the sultanwas so furious that although it was no fault of the governor who hadsentries placed everywhere he sent for him to seringapatam and threwhim to the tigers declaring that there must have been treachery atwork</s>  you may be sure that i have no desire to hold english prisonersafter that and when they have been sent here have been glad indeedwhen orders came for their execution</s> a good many were ordered to be starved to death</s>  but i never waitedfor that</s>  it took too long</s>  do what i could the guards would smugglein pieces of bread and they lingered on for weeks so that it wasmore merciful to finish with them at once besides making me feelcomfortable at the knowledge that there was no chance of their makingtheir escape</s>  there were sentries at their doors as well as on thewalls when the fourteen i have told you about escaped but they dug apassage out at the back of their hut chose a very dark night and itwas only when the sound of some stones that they dislodged as theyscrambled down the precipice gave the alarm to the sentries thattheir escape was discovered</s> no i do not want any prisoners up here and when they do come thereis no sleep for me until i get the order to execute them</s>  but they donot often come now</s>  most of the prisoners who were not given up havebeen killed since and there are not many of them left</s> upon finishing their round they returned to seringapatam where dickdrew up a full report of the result of their investigations</s>  thesultan himself went through it with them questioned them closely cutoff a good many of the items and gave orders that the other demandsshould be complied with and the guns and ammunition sent off at onceto the various forts from the great arsenal at the capital</s> dick was depressed at the result of their journey</s>  his hopes hadfallen lower and lower as at each fort they visited he heard thesame storythat all prisoners sent up to the mountain fortresses hadin a short time been put to death</s>  it was possible of course thathis father might still be at one of the towns where new levies hadbeen drilled but he had not from the first thought it likely that amerchant sailor would be put to this work and had it not been that heclung to the belief that there was a prisoner at savandroog and thatthat prisoner was his father he would have begun to despair</s> it was true that there were still many hill forts scattered about thecountry unvisited but there seemed no reason why any of theprisoners should have been allowed to survive in these forts whenthey had all been put to death in those they had visited among whichwere the places that had been most used as prisons</s> i would give it up he said to surajah were it not that in thefirst place it would almost break my mothers heart</s>  her convictionthat my father is still alive has never been shaken</s>  it has supportedher all these years and i believe that were i to return and tell herthat it was no longer possible to hope her faith would still beunshaken</s>  she would still think of him as pining in some dungeon andwould consider that i had given up the search from faint heartedness</s> that is my chief reason</s>  but i own that i am almost as much influencedby my own conviction that he is in savandroog</s>  i quite admit that ican give no reason whatever why if there is a prisoner there itshould be my father and yet i cannot get it out of my mind that it ishe</s>  i suppose it is because i have the conviction that i believe init</s>  why should i have that impression so strongly if it were not atrue one</s>  i tell myself that it is absurd that i have no real groundsto go upon and yet that does not shake my faith in the slightest</s>  itis perhaps because we have been so fortunate</s>  altogether everythinghas turned out so favourably that i cant help thinking he is aliveand that i shall find him</s> what do you think surajah</s>  ought we to give it up</s> why should we</s>  surajah replied stoutly</s>  i think you are right andthat we are destined to find your father</s>  there is no hurry</s>  we havenot been anything like so long a time as we expected to be andfortune has as you say befriended us wonderfully</s>  we are well offhere</s>  we have positions of honour</s>  for myself i could wish fornothing better</s> well at any rate we will wait for a time dick said</s>  we may besent to savandroog again and if so i will not leave the place untili find out from the governor whether he has still a prisoner and ifso manage to obtain a sight of him</s> the next day dick was informed by the chamberlain that the officerwho was in charge of the wild beasts had fallen into disgrace andthat the sultan had appointed him to the charge</s>  dick was wellpleased in some respects</s>  the work would suit him much better thanexamining stores and seeing that the servants of the palace did theirduty but on the other hand it lessened his chance of being sent tosavandroog again</s>  however there was no choice in the matter andsurajah cheered him by sayingyou must not mind dick</s>  has not everything turned out for the best</s> and you may be sure that this will turn out so also</s> it was indeed but two days later that dick congratulated himselfupon the change for surajah was sent by tippoo with an order for theexecution of four english prisoners</s>  dick knew nothing of the matteruntil surajah on his return told him that he had been obliged tostop and see the orders carried out by poison being forced down theunfortunate officers throats</s> it was horrible he said with tears in his eyes</s> horrible</s>  dick repeated</s>  thank god i have been put to other workfor i feel that i could not have done it</s>  and yet to have refused tocarry out the tyrants orders would have meant death to us both whileit would not have saved the lives of these poor fellows</s>  anyhow iwould not have done it</s>  as soon as i had received the order i wouldhave come to you and we would have mounted and ridden off togetherand taken our chance</s> let us talk of something else surajah said</s>  are the beasts all ingood health</s> as well as they can be when they are fed so badly and so miserablycooped up</s>  i made a great row this morning and have kept the men atwork all day in cleaning out the places</s>  they were all in a horriblestate and before i could get the work done i had to threaten toreport the whole of them to tippoo and they knew what would come ofthat</s>  i told fazli last night that the beasts must have more fleshand got an order from him that all the bones from the kitchens shouldbe given to them</s> that evening when dick on his way to the apartments of one of theofficers was going along a corridor that skirted the portion of thepalace occupied by the zenana a figure came out suddenly from behindthe drapery of a door dropped on her knees beside him and seizinghis hand pressed it to her forehead</s>  it was to all appearance anindian girl in the dress of one of the attendants of the zenana</s> what is it child</s>  he said</s>  you must have mistaken me for someoneelse</s> no bahador she said it is yourself i wanted to thank</s>  one of theother attendants saw you go along this corridor some time ago andever since i have watched here of an evening whenever i could getaway unobserved in hopes of seeing you</s>  it was i my lord whom thetiger was standing over when you came to our rescue</s>  i was not greatlyhurt for i was pushed down when the tiger burst in and save that itseized me with one of its paws and tore my shoulder i was unhurt</s> ever since i have been hoping that the time would come when i couldthank you for saving my life</s> i am glad to have done so child</s>  but you had best retire into thezenana</s>  it would not be good for you or me were i found talking toyou</s> the girl rose to her feet submissively and he now saw her facewhich in the dim light that burnt in the corridor he had nothitherto noticed</s> why he exclaimed with a start you are english</s> yes sahib</s>  i was brought here eight years ago</s>  i am fourteen now</s> there were other english girls here then but they were all older thanme and have been given away to officers of the sultan</s>  i am afraid ishall be too ere long</s>  i have dreaded it so much</s>  but oh sahib youare a favourite of the sultan</s>  if he would but give me to you ishould not mind so much</s> dick was about to reply when he heard a distant footfall</s> go in he exclaimed</s>  someone is coming</s>  i will speak to you againin a day or two</s> when he returned to his room he told surajah what had happened</s> it will at any rate give me a fresh interest here he said</s>  it isterrible to think that a young english girl should be in tippoospower and that he can give her whenever he likes to one of hiscreatures</s>  of course according to our english notions she is stillbut a young girl but as your people out here marry when the girls arebut of the age of this child it is different altogether</s> she does not suspect that you are english</s> no</s>  as i told you i had only just discovered that she was so when iheard a footstep in the distance</s>  but i shall see her again tomorrowor next day</s> you will be running a great risk surajah said gravely</s> not much risk i think dick replied</s>  she is only a little slavegirl and as the tiger was standing over her when i fired no doubt idid save her life and it would be natural enough that she would onmeeting me speak to me and express her thanks</s> that would be a good excuse surajah agreed</s>  but a suspicioustyrant like tippoo might well insist that this was only a pretenceand that the girl was really giving you a letter or message from oneof the inmates of the zenana</s> dick was silent for a time</s> i will be very careful he said</s>  i must certainly see her againand it seems to me at present that whatever risk there may be imust try to save this poor girl from the fate that awaits her</s>  icannot conceal from myself that however much i may refuse to admitit the hopes of my finding and saving my father are faint indeed andalthough this girl is nothing to me i should feel that my mission hadnot been an entire failure if we could take her home with us andrestore her to her friends</s> no i dont think he went on in answer to a grave shake ofsurajahs head that it would add to our danger in getting away</s>  weknow that if we try to escape and are caught our lives will beforfeited in any case and if she were disguised as a boy we couldtravel with her without attracting any more observation than we shouldalone</s>  she would not be missed for hours after she had left and therewould be no reason whatever for connecting her departure with ours</s> i dont say surajah that i have made up my mind about itof courseit has all come fresh to me and i have not had time to think it overin any way</s>  still it does seem to me that when the time for ourleaving comes whether we ride off openly as tippoos officers orwhether we go off in disguise there ought to be no very greatdifficulty in taking her away with us</s>  you see that yourself dontyou</s> i cant give any opinion about it at present surajah replied</s>  ido think that it will add to our difficulties however we may go buti dont say it cannot be managed</s> i should think not surajah and it would be worth doing howevergreat the difficulties might be</s>  just think of the grief that herparents must feel at her loss and the joy when she is restored tothem</s>  you see it would be no great loss of time if we were obligedto take her down to tripataly first and then come back again to renewour search</s>  it would take but a week going and returning and nowthat the passes are all open to us the difficulties would be nothingto what they were when we went back after our scouting expedition</s> besides at that time they were more vigilant all along the frontierthan they will be now because there was war between the twocountries and tippoo was anxious that no news of his movements shouldbe taken down</s>  there is no talk of war now for though tippoo makes nodisguise of his fury at his losses especially at coorg being takenfrom him and is evidently bent upon fighting again it will take avery long time to get his army into an efficient state to repair hisfortresses to complete all the new works of defence he is getting uphere and to restore the confidence of his soldiers</s> i should think it will be fully four or five years before he is readyto fight again</s>  at any rate if we once get well away from here withthe girl we ought to have no difficulty in getting across thefrontier</s>  it would mean but a fortnight lost in the search for myfather and anyhow we are not making any progress that way as longas we stop here</s>  the only drawback would be so far as i can see thatwe should lose the benefit of our official positions but unless wehappen to be sent off with orders to other hill forts that positionwill only hamper our movements</s>  besides we should still have ourbadges of office and tippoos official orders to the governors</s> possibly the news that we had disappeared might reach the governorsof some of the forts in this neighbourhood but it would not be likelyto travel very far</s>  his officers so frequently fall into disgrace andare either killed or thrown to the tigers that the fact of our beingmissing would scarce excite a remark and those who heard of it wouldsuppose that we had either been secretly made away with or thathaving learned that tippoo was displeased with us we had fled</s> surajah nodded</s>  his confidence in his leader was complete and he wasalways ready to follow unquestioningly</s> there is one thing surajah dick concluded</s>  this state of thingscannot last much longer anyhow for next time it might be me heordered to see to the execution of an english prisoner and that wouldmean that i should as soon as i received the command make a bolt forit</s>  so you see our stay here in any case may not last many days</s>  iwould rather run any risks than carry out such an order</s> two evenings later dick went down the corridor at the same hour asthat on which he had before met the english girl</s>  she came out frombehind the hangings at once when he passed</s> i knew you would come bahador</s>  she said joyfully</s>  i could see thatyou were as kind as you were brave and would have pity upon a poorlittle white slave</s> i have much that i want to say to you child</s>  this is not a goodplace for speaking</s>  someone might come along at any moment</s>  how longcan you be away without fear of your absence being noticed</s> not long now she said</s>  in the morning i am sent out on messagesand could meet you anywhere</s> very well</s>  i will remain in my room all the morning tomorrow and ifyou do not come then i will stay in next day</s> i will come the girl said unhesitatingly</s> he then gave her full instructions how to find his room and made herrepeat them to him in order to be sure that she had them correctly</s> do you know my companion by sight</s>  he asked</s> oh yes</s>  i have seen him often</s> well either he or i will be standing at my door</s>  it is as well thatyou should look carefully round before you enter so as to be surethere is no one in the corridor and that you can slip in unobserved</s> you may be sure that i am asking you to come for no idle freak butbecause i have something very important to say to you</s> i fancy i hear footsteps</s>  good night</s> dick was sure that he and surajah would both be at liberty next dayfor tippoo had that morning started for bangalore where a largenumber of men were at work repairing the fortifications and removingall signs of the british occupation from the fort and palace</s>  he waslikely to be away for at least a fortnight</s>  as soon as ibrahim hadswept the room after their early breakfast dick gave him a number ofsmall commissions to be executed in the town and told him that heshould not require him again until it was time to bring up their mealfrom the kitchen</s>  then he and surajah by turns watched at the door</s> an hour later surajah who was upon the watch saidthe girl is coming</s> there was no one else in sight and when surajah beckoned to her shehurried on and passing through the curtains at the door entered theroom</s>  it had been arranged that surajah should remain on watch sothat should by any chance one of the officials of their acquaintancecome along he might go out and talk with him in the corridor and onsome excuse or other prevent his entering the room if he showed anyintention of doing so</s>
now in the first place dick said as he led the girl to the divanand seated her there what is your name</s> my name is goorla</s> no i mean your proper name</s> my name used to be annieannie mansfield bahador</s> and my name is dick holland he said in english</s>
she gave a start of surprise</s> yes annie i am a countryman of yours</s> she looked at him almost incredulously and then an expression ofaversion succeeded that of confidence in her face</s>  she sprang from thedivan and drew herself up indignantly</s> please let me go she said haughtily</s>  you have saved my life butif you had saved it twenty times i could not like a man who is adeserter</s> dick had at first been speechless with astonishment at the girlschange of manner and at her reception of the news he had thoughtwould have been very pleasant to her</s>  as her last words threw a lightupon the matter he burst into a merry laugh</s> i am no deserter annie</s>  save my friend at the door and yourselfthere is no one here who knows that i am english</s>  sit down again andi will tell you how i come to be here</s> my father was the captain of an english ship</s>  she was wrecked on thewest coast and he was seized and brought up here a prisoner eightyears ago</s>  my mother who is a daughter of the late rajah oftripataly who married an english lady taught me to speak hindustaniso that when i got old enough i could come out here and try to findout if my father was still alive and if so to help him to escape</s>  ihad only just come up here with my friend who is an officer of therajahs when that affair with the tiger took place</s>  then as youknow tippoo made us both officers in the palace</s>  of course while weare here we can do nothing towards finding out about my father and weshould not have remained here much longer anyway and may have toleave at any moment</s>  since you met me and i found that there was anenglish girl captive here it has of course changed my plans and ifeel that i could not go away and leave you to the fate you told meof and that if possible i must take you away with me</s>  that is ofcourse if you are willing to go with us and prepared to run acertain amount of risk</s> do not take on so he continued as the girl threw herself on herknees and clinging to him burst into a passion of tears</s>  do notcry like that and stooping down he lifted her and placed her in acorner of the divan</s>  there he said patting her on the shoulder asshe sobbed almost convulsively try and compose yourself</s>  we may bedisturbed at any moment and may not have an opportunity of talkingagain so we must make our arrangements in readiness to leavesuddenly</s>  i may find it necessary to go at an hours notice</s>  you mayas you said be given by tippoo to one of his favourites at any time</s> fortunately he has gone away for a fortnight so we have at any ratethat time before us to make our plans</s>  still it is better that weshould arrange now as much as we can</s> chapter 15 escape</s> annie mansfield was not long before she mastered her emotions</s>  she hadlearned to do so in a bitter school</s>  beaten for the slightest faultor at the mere caprice of one of her many mistresses she had learnedto suffer pain without a tear to assume a submissive attitude underthe greatest provocation to receive without attempting to defendherself punishment for faults she had not committed and to preservean appearance of cheerfulness when her heart seemed breaking at thehopelessness of any deliverance from her fate</s>  for the last six monthsshe had been specially unhappy for when seringapatam had beenbesieged she had hoped that when it was captured her countrymenwould search the palace and see that this time no english captiveremained behind</s>  her disappointment then when she heard that peacehad been made and that the english army was to march away withouteven an attempt to see that the condition for the release of captiveswas faithfully carried out had for a time completely crushed her andall hope had forsaken her</s> thus then while she had been for a moment overwhelmed at findingthat her preserver from the tiger was a countryman in disguise andthat he was willing to make an attempt to rescue her yet in a fewminutes she stifled her sobs hastily thrust back the hair that hadfallen over her face uncoiled herself from her crouching position inthe angle of the divan and rose to her feet</s> i can hardly believe it to be true she said in a low voice</s>  ohsahib do you really mean what you say</s>  and are you willing to run therisk of taking me away with you</s> of course i am dick said heartily</s>  you dont suppose that anenglishman would be so base as to leave a young countrywoman in thehands of these wretches</s>  i do not think that there is much risk in it</s> of course you will have to disguise yourself and there may be somehardships to go through but once away from here we are not likely tobe interfered with</s>  you see my friend and i are officers of thepalace and no one would venture to question us as we should besupposed to be travelling upon the sultans business</s>  there is peaceat present and although tippoo may intend some day or other tofight again everything is settling down quietly</s>  traders go about thecountry unquestioned</s>  there is plenty of traffic on the roads from onetown to another and so long as your disguise is good enough toprevent your being recognised as a white there is no greater dangerin travelling in mysore than there would be down in the carnatic</s> annie stood before him with her fingers playing nervously with eachother</s>  long trained in habits of implicit obedience and to stand inan attitude of deep respect before her numerous mistresses she was inignorance whether she ought to speak or not</s>  she had been but a childof six when she had been carried off</s>  her remembrance of englishmanners had quite died out and the habit of silent submission hadbecome habitual to her</s>  dick was puzzled by her silence</s> of course annie he said at last i dont want you to go with meif you would rather stay here or if you are afraid of the risk oftravelling</s> she looked up with frightened eyes</s> oh sahib it is not that i would go even if i felt sure i shouldbe found out and cut to pieces</s>  anything would be better than this</s>  iam not afraid at all</s> but forgive me sahib</s>  i dont know how to thank you</s>  i dont knowwhat is proper to say</s>  it is all so strange and so wonderful</s> oh that is all right annie dick said cheerfully</s>  of course youwill feel it a little strange just at starting</s> well in the first place you must call me dick instead of callingme sahib and in the next place you must talk to me freely as afriend and not stand as if i were your master</s>  while we are on thisjourney together consider me as a sort of big brother</s>  when we getdown the ghauts i shall hand you over to the care of my mother who isliving at present at tripataly with her brother the rajah</s> now sit down again and let us make our arrangements</s>  when we havedone that we can talk if there is time</s>  now how am i to let you knowif i have to go away suddenly</s>  do you always get out at this time of amorning</s> not always but very often</s>  i always go down at twelve oclock withsome of the other slave girls to fetch the food and sweetmeats forthe ladies of the harem</s> well you must always manage even if you are not sent out to lookout through that doorway where you met me at eight oclock in themorning</s>  if we have anything particular to say to you surajahthatis my friend you knowwill be there</s>  which way do you go out fromthe harem to fetch the food</s> not from that door but from the one nearest to the kitchen</s>  you goright down that corridor and then take the first turning to theright</s>  there is a flight of stairs at its end</s>  we come out at the doorjust at its head</s>  at the foot of the stairs there is a long passageand at the end of that is a large room with tables on which thedishes are placed in readiness for us to bring back</s> well if it is necessary to speak to you at once one of us will meetyou in the passage between the bottom of the stairs and the room wherethe food is</s>  if you see one of us you will know that the matter isurgent and as soon as you can possibly slip away you must come here</s> in the evening you had better again look out from the door where youfirst met me</s> now as to the disguise it will be better for you to go as a boy</s>  itwould be strange to see a girl riding behind two of the officers ofthe palace</s>  you wont mind that will you</s> not at all sahib</s> not at all dick he corrected</s>  well i will have a dress ready foryou here</s>  you will find it in that corner and there will be a bottleof stain on the table</s>  it will be only necessary for you to colouryour neck hands and feet but you must cut off your hair behind toa level with your ears so that none of it will show below the turban</s> you must do that of course before you stain your neck and muststain the skin where you have cut off your hair also</s>  i am giving youthese instructions now because when the time comes there may not be aminute to spare though of course i hope there will be no desperatehurry</s> i understand she said and will look out for you three times aday</s> of course he went on if you are suddenly told that you are to begiven to any one you must slip out at once and come here</s>  you willfind everything ready for you to disguise yourself and you must dothat at once and wait here till one of us comes</s>  even if you aremissed it will be some time before any search is made and it wouldbe thought much more likely that you had gone down into the town thanthat you were hiding in the palace so there would be no chance oftheir looking for you here before we return</s>  anyhow we shall be ableto have another talk before tippoo comes back</s>  we shall be here everymorning until nine and if you are able to get away again come andsee us</s> it will be better perhaps for you not to wait any longer now</s>  isuppose you have been charged with some message or other and it wouldnot do for you to be too long gone</s> the girl stood up at once</s> i have to go down to the pettah to get some sewing silk to matchthis and she drew out a small fragment of yellow silk</s> very well then</s>  you had better go and do it or they may think thatyou are too long away</s> goodbye annie</s>  i hope that in another week or ten days at thelatest i shall have you out of this and he held out his hand toher</s> she took it timidly and would have raised it to her forehead butdick said laughingthat is not the way annie</s>  english girls dont treat their friendsas if they were lords and masters</s>  they just shake hands with them asif it were two men or two girls</s> i shall know better in time she said with a faint smile thoughher eyes were full of tears</s>  i want to do something though i dontknow what</s>  you saved my life from the tiger and now you are going tosave me again</s>  i should like to throw myself down and kiss yourfeet</s> you would make me horribly uncomfortable if you did anything of thesort annie</s>  i can understand that you feel strange and out of yourelement at present but you will soon get over that when you come toknow me better</s> there goodbye lassie</s>  i hope to see you again tomorrow or nextday and then you will be able to tell me more about yourself</s> is the coast clear surajah</s> surajah looked out through the curtains</s> there is no one in sight he said a moment later</s> the girl passed silently out and went down the corridor</s>  surajahreturned from his post by the door</s> the poor girl is shy and awkward as yet dick said but i thinkshe will be plucky enough when the time comes</s>  you heard what wesaid</s>  the first thing will be to get her disguise ready for her</s>  whatdo you think</s>  had we better take ibrahim with us</s>  i think he is to betrusted</s> i am sure he is surajah agreed</s>  he is a hindoo of coorg and wascarried away as a slave six years ago</s>  in the first place he will bedelighted at the prospect of getting away and in the next i am surethat he is very fond of you</s>  but there is no occasion to tell him thatyou are english</s> no it will be time enough to do that when we get over the ghauts</s>  itwill be better that he should get the disguise</s>  in the first place hewill know exactly what is wanted and in the next it would look rumfor either of us to be buying such a thing</s>  of course we could askpertaub to get it for us but if we take ibrahim with us he may aswell buy it</s> we shall want a couple more horses</s>  these of course we can buyourselves and saddles and things</s>  when we have got them we hadbetter leave them at some place on the other side of the river</s> pertaub would help us there</s>  he is sure to know someone who will lookafter them for a few days</s>  then ibrahim and the girl can starttogether go over there and saddle them so as to be in readiness tomount directly we come along</s>  we will stop at the wood and dig up thecaskets</s>  there is nothing like taking them away with us when there isa chance and it is not likely that we shall come back to seringapatamagainit would be like putting our heads into a tigers den</s> when ibrahim brought in the dishes for their meal dick saidgo down and get your own food ibrahim and when you have done comeback here again</s>  i want to have a talk with you</s> they had just finished their meal when ibrahim returned</s> ibrahim would you be glad of a chance of getting away from here andreturning to your own country</s> i would have given anything to do so my lord ibrahim said beforei was ordered to attend upon you</s>  but i am happy now</s>  you are kind tome and i should not like to leave your service</s> but if i were going too ibrahim</s> then my lord i would go with you anywhere if you would take me</s> well ibrahim we feel sure that we can trust you and so i may tellyou that i think it likely we shall very shortly go away</s>  you knowwhat the sultan is</s>  one day he gives you honours and rewards the nexthe disgraces you and perhaps sends you into the ranks of the armyperhaps has you thrown to the tigers</s>  we do not care to live undersuch conditions and we mean in a few days to slip away and go toour friends down the ghauts</s>  you can come with us if you like</s> i would go with you to the end of the world my lord ibrahimexclaimed earnestly</s>  to go with you and be a free man and not aslave would be almost too great happiness</s> very well then that is settled</s>  now ibrahim we are not goingalone</s>  we are going to take with us a young white slave in the haremand restore her to her friends</s>  i want you to get a disguise for her</s> let it be a dress like your ownlong white trousers to the ankle ashirt and tunic with waist belt also the stuff for a turban</s>  that youmust wind in proper folds as she would not be able to do it herself</s> i also want a bottle of stain for the skin</s> i will get them my lord</s>  how tall is she</s> about half a head shorter than you are</s>  she is about the size of anaverage hindoo woman</s> shall i get the things at once my lord</s> yes you had better get them today</s>  we may leave at any time and itis as well to have them in readiness</s>  we shall buy two horses one foreach of you and have them taken across the river</s>  you can ride isuppose</s> yes i used to ride when i was a boy before tippoo came down andkilled my father and mother and brought me up here</s>  will my lord wantme to take the horses across</s> i will tell you that in the morning ibrahim</s>  we are going down intothe town now to inquire about them but we shall not buy any untiltomorrow as we shall have to make arrangements for them to be keptfor us until we want them</s> they did not go out until it was dark and then took their way topertaubs house</s>  the old hindoo was in</s> i am glad to see you sahibs he said to dick as they entered</s>  ihave always fears that ill may in some way befall you</s> we are going to leave pertaub</s>  surajah had two days ago to go upto see four english prisoners put to death at one of the hill forts</s> next time i may be ordered on such a duty</s>  i could not carry it outand you know that refusal would probably mean death</s>  moreover we areconvinced that we have no means here of finding out what captivesmay still be in tippoos hands and have therefore determined toleave</s>  we are going to take with us our servant ibrahim who is aslave from coorg and will we know be faithful to us and also ayoung english girl who has for eight years been a slave in tippoosharem</s>  she will go with us in the disguise of a boy</s>  this ibrahim isgetting for us</s>  we are going to buy a couple of horses for them andshall make straight down the ghauts where i shall leave the girl inmy mothers care</s> it is a good action the hindoo said gravely</s> now in the first place pertaub would you like to go with us</s> riding as we shall do as two of the officers of the palace it is notlikely that any questions whatever will be asked and certainly weshall have no difficulty until it comes to crossing the frontier</s> no sahib</s>  i thank you but i am too old now for any fresh change</s> i have friends here and have none below the ghauts</s>  nothing save therescue of my daughter from the harem would induce me to move now andof that there is little chance</s>  she will by this time have becomereconciled to her fate and would probably not care to escape were anopportunity offered to her</s>  besides with only me to protect her whatwould she do elsewhere</s>  a few months and she might be left alone inthe world</s> as to that dick said i could promise her the protection of myaunt the wife of the rajah of tripataly</s>  after the kindness that youhave shown to us she would i am sure gladly take her into herservice</s>  and there would be no difficulty about a dowry for her</s>  iwould see to that</s> the old man shook his head</s> there could be no question of marriage he said but should i everhear from her that she is unhappy and i can arrange to fly with heri will assuredly avail myself of your offer and take her totripataly rejoiced indeed that at my death there will be a shelteropen to her</s> and now can i aid you in any way sahib</s>  one of my friends amerchant could get the horses for you without difficulty</s>  he hasoften occasion to buy them for the purposes of his trade</s> thank you pertaub</s>  i had intended to buy them myself but doubtlessit will be safer for somebody else to do so</s>  what i was going to askyou was to let me know of some place on the other side of the riverwhere the horses could be kept until i want them</s> that i can do sahib</s>  i have a friend a cultivator</s>  his house standsby itself on this side of the first villagethe one half a milebeyond the ford</s>  it is the only house this side of the village so youcannot mistake it</s>  it lies about a hundred yards back from the road</s>  iwill go over and arrange with him that when two horses arrive theyshall be placed in his stalls and remain there until one arrives whowill say to him after greeting the word madras</s>  to him he is todeliver the horses at once whether he comes by night or day</s> that would do admirably pertaub</s>  of course i shall also wantsaddles and bridles</s>  how much do you think it will come toaltogether</s>  i do not want showy horses but they must be animalscapable of performing a long journey and of travelling at a fair rateof speedthe faster the better</s>  we are likely to get seven or eighthours start at least but must of course travel fast</s>  as long asall goes well i shall keep the main roads but if there is abreakdown or an unforeseen accident occurs i may have to leave theroad and take to bypaths</s> the cost of such horses would be about eighty rupees each thesaddles and bridles another fifteen or twenty</s> then here are two hundred rupees pertaub</s> have you given up all hope of finding your father sahib</s>  i have feltso sure that you would be successful</s>  it seemed to me that such braveefforts could not go unrewarded</s> no pertaub i have not given it up at all</s>  i intend to stay attripataly for a fortnight with my mother and shall then come up theghauts again</s> that is another matter i want to speak to you about</s>  of course weshould not dare to return to seringapatam and i think that we hadbetter settle to go to bangalore</s>  could you forward our packs withthe merchandise to someone in that town</s> there will be no difficulty in that sahib</s>  there are many hindoomerchants there who have been forced to change their religion andwho have frequent dealings with traders here</s>  one of my friends willi am sure forward your goods with the next consignment that he sendsto bangalore</s>  that also i will arrange tomorrow and when you comein the evening will give you the name of the trader there togetherwith a letter from the one here telling him that you are the personto whom the goods are to be given up</s> thank you pertaub</s>  i dont know what we should have done withoutyour assistance</s> it has been a pleasure to me to be of use to you sahib</s>  i hadthought my time of usefulness was over and it has given a realpleasure to my life to have been able to aid you</s>  you will let meknow sahib if ever you find your father</s> certainly pertaub</s>  i will in any case send word to you eitherthat i have found him or that i have given up all hope and haveabandoned my efforts</s> the next morning a lad brought dick a message from pertaub that hehad fulfilled all his commissions and on the following morning anniemansfield again came to dicks room</s> everything is going on well annie dick said as he shook handswith her</s>  the horses have been bought</s>  there is your disguise in thatcorner and we can start any moment at a quarter of an hours notice</s> now i want you to tell me how you came to be brought up here</s> i have not much to tell she said</s>  you see i was only six yearsold</s>  i can remember there was a great deal of firing of guns and thatlasted for a long time</s>  then the firing stopped</s>  i suppose the placesurrendered</s> do you know what place it was annie</s> she shook her head</s> i do not know at all</s>  i suppose i did know then but i do notremember ever to have heard the name</s>  i remember quite well that therewere soldiers and father and mother and servants and many otherpeople and everyone was very miserable and we all went together outof a gate and on each side there were a great many natives with gunsand swords some on horse and some on foot and there were elephants</s> i dont think i had ever seen one before for i noticed themparticularly</s>  we went on and on and i know one of the soldierscarried me</s> at night we stopped somewhere</s>  i think it was in a wood and therewere fires and we lay down to sleep on the ground</s>  then i woke upsuddenly and there was a great noise and firing of guns and someonecaught me up and threw something over my head and i dont rememberanything more for a long time</s>  i know that presently i was onhorseback before a fiercelooking man</s>  there were a good many ofthem and when i cried for my father and mother they said they wouldcut off my head if i were not quiet</s> i do not know how long we were travelling but after the first daythere was only the man who carried me and another</s>  i was broughthere and there were many people and i was very much frightened</s>  theni found myself only among women and they took off my clothes anddressed me in their fashion</s>  i think i was very happy when i once gotaccustomed to it</s>  the ladies made a sort of pet of me and i wastaught to dance and to sing little native songs</s>  there were otherwhite girls here and they were all very kind to me though theyalways seemed very sad and i could not make out why they cried sooften especially when they were beaten for crying</s> as i grew bigger i was not so happy</s>  i had ceased to be a playthingand little by little i was set to work to sweep and dust and then tosew and then to do all sorts of work like the other slave girls</s>  theother white girls gradually went away the oldest first</s>  the last twowho were two or three years older than i was went about three yearsago</s> at first i used to wonder why they cried so when they went and whythe others all cried too but by the time the last two left i hadcome to know all about it and knew that they had been given by thesultan to his favourite officers</s> there were many white men here when i first came</s>  when i went outwith one of the slaves into the town i saw them often</s>  sometimesthey would burst into tears when they saw me</s>  then i used to wonderwhy but i know now that i must have reminded them of girls of theirown whom they would never see again</s>  then till three years agothere were about twenty white boys who had been taught to dance andsing and who used to come sometimes dressed up like women to amusethe ladies of the harem but i heard that they were all killed whenthe sultan first thought that the english might come here</s>  one of theslave girls told me that it was done because the sultan had oftensworn to the english that there were no white captives here and sohe did not wish that any should be found if they came</s> i dont think that i have anything else to tell you</s> well i hope that what you have told me will be enough to enable ussome day to find out who you belong to</s>  evidently you were in someplace that was besieged eight years ago and had to surrender</s>  thegarrison were promised their lives and liberty to depart</s>
 they wereattacked at night by an armed party who may have been hydershorsemen but who were perhaps merely a party of mounted robbers whothought that they might be able to take some loot</s>  most likely theywere defeated especially as you saw no other captives in the partybut in the confusion of the night attack one of them probably cameupon you and carried you off thinking you would be an acceptablepresent here and that he would get a reward for you from the sultan</s> are you not noticed when you go into the streets on errands</s> no i always go veiled</s>  except the slaves who are old and ugly allthe others wear veils when they go outside the palace and we all weara red scarf which shows we are servants in the harem and so evenwhen the town is full of rough soldiers no one ventures to speak tous</s> now tell me dickyou see i have not forgottenall about how youcame to be here</s> dick told her briefly how he had come out with his mother and howfinding war had broken out he had joined the army and how at theend of the war having been able to learn nothing about his father hehad come up with surajah to search for him</s> and then you saw that tiger break in the girl said eagerly</s>  thatwas dreadful</s>  i will tell you how it was the tiger came to seize me</s>  iwas standing behind a lady and could not see anything</s>  suddenly theyall began screaming and ran some to one side some to the other ofthe window and i who could not think what was the matter remainedwhere i was when there was a great cry and before i had time tomove or even to wonder some great thing knocked me down</s>  it was onlyfrom the screams of the ladies and their cries of tiger</s>  that iknew what had happened</s>  i felt something heavy standing on mesoheavy that i could hardly breathe and indeed i did not try tobreathe for i knew many stories of tigers and had heard thatsometimes when a man shams being dead the tiger will walk away andkill someone else</s> the tiger was keeping up an angry growl and i felt that unless ittook its paw off me i should soon die when i heard a shot and afierce growl from the tiger and then the weight was gone and i thinki fainted</s>  when i came round i was lying where i fell for many ofthe ladies were insensible and everyone was too busy with them tothink anything of me</s> when i got up one of the other slave girls who had been braveenough to look out of the window told me that it had been killed bytwo young men one of whom must have been the one who had fired theshot in at the window</s>  i went and looked out and saw it lying there</s> after that every one talked and laughed and cried and then thesultans chief wife said that everyone must make a present to theyoung men who had saved us and that each one ought to give one of herbest jewels</s>  of course everyone did</s>  i had nothing to give except alittle cross of gold filigree work that hung round my neck when i wascarried off</s>  it had been hidden by my dress</s>  the men had not noticedit and they had not taken it away when i was brought here</s>  it wassuch a poor little gift but it was all i had</s> i noticed it annie dick said there was a little flat platebehind it with the letters a</s>  m</s>  and i thought then that it mustbe some little ornament taken from one of the englishwomen hyderstroops killed</s>  it is fortunate you kept it for it may be usefulsomeday in proving that you are annie mansfield</s> now i must be going she said</s>  i was slapped and pinched lasttime for being so long but i have several things to get today sothat if i hurry i can be back again as soon as they expect me</s>  youhave not settled when you are going yet</s> no but we rather think of going the day after tomorrow</s>  it will bebetter to do so before tippoo comes back for we might be ordered awayso quickly as to have no time to make arrangements</s>  besides therewill be ten times as many people about in the palace and more guardsat the entrances when he returns</s>  so altogether it will be better togo before he does so</s>  if we settle it so i will come along past yourdoor tomorrow evening and if i say tomorrow morning get here assoon as you can in the morning and directly you have stained yourskin and put on your disguise we will start</s>  my servant who is goingwith us will act as your guide and will take you to the place wherethe horses are and where we shall join you almost as soon as you getthere</s> at the appointed time next evening dick told annie that they shouldstart in the morning</s>  he and surajah then went down and said goodbyeto pertaub and dick gave him a letter to his aunt to give to hershould he ever go to tripataly with his daughter</s> it may be he said that neither surajah nor i may be there but ishall speak to her about you and of course tell her how much you havedone for us so you may be sure of the heartiest welcome from her</s> and you will also find a hearty friend in my father rajbullubsurajah said</s>  he is principal officer in the rajahs household andwill treat you as a brother and your daughter as if she were mysister</s> then they returned to the palace where they had a final talk over theroute that it would be best to pursue</s>  the nearest point to the newfrontier was the territory ceded to the english on the malabar coast</s> but this would entail a long sea voyage and they therefore determinedto make for caveripatam going by the road that led through aniculland then through ryacotta which stood just outside the line ofterritory ceded to england and from whence a road led direct down thepasses</s>  anicull lay nearly due south of bangalore but the road theywould follow would not be the one by which tippoo would return as hewould come by the main road which ran in a direct line between thetwo cities</s> ibrahim was informed of their plans and was told to warn the syce toget their horses saddled and in readiness at eight oclock and thatas they were going for a long days ride he would not be required toaccompany themas he always did when they rode only into the townfor then he might be wanted to hold the horses if they dismounted andwent into a shop</s> he was also to give notice in the kitchen that they would not returnto the midday meal and that dishes for them would therefore not berequired</s>  thus it would be unlikely that any suspicion would bearoused by their absence until they had been gone twentyfour hoursby which time they would be more than halfway to the frontier</s> they went to bed at their usual time and slept soundly for it seemedto them both that there was practically no risk whatever to be runand that they would be across the frontier before any active searchwas made for them</s>  even when it was discovered that they had left thepalace it would be thought that they had received some order frombangalore either to join the sultan or to go on some mission for himthat had occupied more time than they had anticipated on starting</s>  theidea that two officers who were considered to stand high in tippoosfavour should desert would scarcely occur to anyone</s> in the morning they were up early completed their slightpreparations and took their early breakfast reserving a portion forannie who they thought would not improbably have eaten nothingbefore coming to them</s> she was a quarter of an hour late in arriving and looked somewhatpale and flurried</s> they did not send me out this morning she said and so i had tostay until i could slip out without being noticed but they may missme at any moment</s> that will be all right dick said confidently</s>  they will search allthe rooms in the harem for you first and certainly wont look foryou outside until there has been a lot of talk over your absence</s>  buteven if they do search you will be able in a few minutes to walkthrough the middle of them without being suspected</s> however we will lose no time and to begin with i will cut off whathair is necessary</s>  i shall do it a good deal quicker than you would</s> then we will leave you to yourself to stain your skin and put on yourdisguise</s>  when you have finished clap your hands</s>  ibrahim will comein and see that your disguise is all right and that your turbancovers your hair</s>  then he will go with you</s>  we shall be waiting nearthe gate</s>  there is practically no chance of your being asked anyquestions but if you are and there is any difficulty we will passyou through all right</s>  having seen you on your way we shall mount andfollow you</s> the operation of cutting off annies hair to the line of her earswas speedily done then with a few reassuring words dick joinedsurajah in the corridor</s>  as they walked down it he saidi dont like leaving them to themselves</s>  look here surajah you godown to the stable and mount at once</s>  tell the syce i shall come formy horse in a few minutes</s>  then ride out and take your post where youcan see them come out of the gate and then follow them closely</s>  iwill stay here and see them safely through the gate and then mountand follow you</s>  i shall overtake you before you get to the ford</s> that will perhaps be safest surajah agreed though i should thinkthere is no chance of her being suspected seeing that she will bewith ibrahim</s>  even if they met one of the palace officers and heasked ibrahim who he had with him he could say it was a lad who hadcome to you respecting some horses you had bought</s> yes that would do very well</s> dick returned to ibrahim who was squatting down in the corridor nearthe door</s> i am going to follow you until you are through the gate and shallkeep a short distance behind you</s>  if you should meet any officer onyour way out who may ask you who you have with you say he has comewith a message to me from a trader in the town</s>  by the time you havetold him that i shall be up</s> there is no chance of being questioned my lord</s>  people come and goall day</s> that is so ibrahim but one cannot be too careful</s> they stood talking together until they heard annie clap her handswithin</s>  ibrahim entered at once and in two or three minutes came outagain with the girl</s>  ibrahim carried a bundle</s> you will do very well dick said to annie</s>  i should not know youin the least</s>  you make a capital boy</s> what bundle is that ibrahim</s>  i thought you took our other disguiseson yesterday to the stable where the horses are</s> yes my lord i took them on</s>  these are the things she has taken off</s> i thought perhaps it would be better not to leave them here as ifthey were found it would be known that she had gone with you</s> i dont think it makes much difference ibrahim but perhaps it is aswell to bring them away</s>  we can leave the bundle in the wood</s> now go along</s>  i will follow</s>  perhaps i had better go first</s>  keep afew paces behind me</s> they passed through the long passages of the palace withoutattracting the slightest attention</s>  once or twice dick paused tospeak to some officials of his acquaintance the others stoppingrespectfully a few paces away</s>  then he went out into the courtyardand across to the gate and as the sentries saluted he stopped andasked them a few questions as to the regiment they belonged to untilibrahim and his companion who had passed straight through were wellaway</s>  he saw surajah sitting upon his horse a couple of hundred yardsaway and then went to the stables</s> chapter 16 the journey</s> the syce brought out his horse as soon as he saw dick approaching</s> you need not wait up for us after nine oclock dick said as hemounted</s>  it is possible that we may be detained and shall not returnuntil tomorrow evening</s>  if we come we shall certainly be back by nineat the latest and we shall not be back before seven at any rate sothat until then you are free to do as you like</s> he rode quietly off and did not quicken his pace until he had gotbeyond the fort</s>  then he touched the horse with his heel and cantereddown to the ford</s>  surajah was halfway across the river when hereached it</s>  the other two figures were just ascending the road up theother bank</s> surajah checked his horse when he got across and waited till dickjoined him</s> shall we go on with them to the farmhouse</s>  he asked</s> we may as well do so as halt in the road</s>  besides there are thethings ibrahim took over yesterday to put into our saddlebags</s>  thereis another thing that i never thought of</s>  of course the girl hasnever been on a horse and that may give us a good deal of trouble</s>  iwonder i did not think of it though if i had i dont see thatanything else could have been done</s>  we must see how she gets on andif she cannot manage i must take her before me whenever we see thatthe road is clear for a good distance ahead</s>  of course it does notmatter about country people but if we see a body of troops coming inthe distance she must mount her own horse again and follow us at awalk</s>  if we find that things dont go well we must halt in a woodsomewhere and ride only by night</s> they cantered on now and overtook the others just as they reached thefarmhouse</s>  the farmer was at his door and looked a little surprisedat seeing two of the officers of the palace come up</s>  he salaameddeeply</s> we have not come to requisition anything dick said with a smileas he saw that the farmer looked alarmed as well as surprised</s>  wehave only come for the two horses that we have bought for ourservants as we are going on a journey</s> can i assist you in any way my lords</s> no our men will saddle the horses dick said and dismountingwent into the stable with ibrahim and annie</s> you are not afraid of riding i hope annie</s>  he said</s> i am not afraid of anything dick so that i can but get away</s> we will go quietly at first anyhow</s>  mind as you mount put yourleft foot in the stirrup</s>  when you are seated carry yourself aseasily as you can</s>  the pony looks quiet enough but if when we getfairly off you find that you cannot sit comfortably you must get upbefore me and ibrahim must lead your pony</s>  when we are fairly on theroad i will fasten a bit of rope to your bridle to act as a leadingrein and you can ride by my side unless we see people coming alongthen you must drop behind with ibrahim</s> i wont give more trouble than i can help she said</s> ibrahim had taken some rugs over with him on the previous afternoonwhich had been bought in case they should sleep out at night</s>  when thehorses were saddled dick rolled two of these up strapped one on thehigh peak and the other on the cantle of the saddle upon which thegirl was to ride</s> that will wedge you in pretty tightly he said</s> now ibrahim put the things into the saddlebag and then we shall beready</s> when this was done the two horses were led outside</s>  the farmer hadgone back into the house and dick helping the girl into her seatarranged the stirrups the right length for her</s> now he said you must keep your knees pressed against the roll ofblankets in front and hold on as well as you can with them but theprincipal thing is for you to balance yourself with your body</s>  dontsit up stiffly but as if you were in a chair</s> now we will start at a walk</s>  ibrahim will keep quite close to youso as to be able to catch hold of your rein should there be anyoccasion for him to do so</s> then mounting he and surajah rode off at a walk the othersfollowing a length or two behind them</s>  dick looked round from time totime and saw that annie exhibited no signs of nervousness</s> i am quite comfortable she said in reply to one of his glances</s> when they got into the road again dick saidwe will go at an easy canter now annie</s>  if you feel as if you couldnot keep on call out and we will stop directly but first come upbetween surajah and myself and we will take the leading reins sothat you will have nothing to attend to but holding on</s> two cords had been attached to the bridle before setting out andsurajah and dick each taking one they started again the horsesinstinctively breaking into a canter which was their usual pace</s> annie at first grasped the strap of the rug in front of her but assoon as she became accustomed to the motion she let go</s>  a small rughad been strapped over the saddle before she mounted and thisafforded her a much better hold than she would have had of theleather and as the pace of the horse was a gentle one she found itmuch more easy to keep her seat than she had expected</s>  moreover thefact that dick and surajah rode close by her side and would be ableto catch her at once if she swayed in the saddle gave herconfidence</s> it is much better than i thought it would be she said</s>  it is quitea pleasant motion</s>  i will go faster if you like</s> no there is no occasion for that dick replied</s>  this is the pacethe horses are most accustomed to and they will go on longer at itthan at any other</s>  there is no fear of pursuit and we have all daybefore us</s> after a quarter of a miles riding they came to a wood</s> we must turn in here dick said</s>  we are going treasure hunting</s>  wehid those caskets that were given us by the ladies directly after wegot them and we are going to dig them up now and take them with us</s> they rode at a walk now till they came to a very large baobab treegrowing by the path they were following</s> here we turn off</s> there is a man there surajah exclaimed when they had ridden a fewyards farther</s> dick checked his horse</s> it is pertaub he said a moment later and in a minute they werebeside the hindoo</s> i could not sleep thinking of you sahib the latter said as theycame up</s>  so i came across here partly to help you dig up thecaskets and partly that i might see you and assure myself that sofar all had gone well</s> thank you pertaub</s>  you have i see brought a pickaxe</s>  it will saveus half an hours work and besides i am glad to say goodbye again</s> all has gone well</s>  this is the young lady</s> she is well disguised pertaub said bowing his head to annie</s>  shelooks so like a boy that even now you tell me i can scarce believeshe is a white girl</s>  truly you can go on without fear that anyone willsuspect her</s> leading the way to the spot where the caskets had been buried dicklooked on while surajah and ibrahim dug them up</s>  they were thenwrapped up in rugs and strapped securely behind their ownerssaddles</s>  then after a warm adieu to the kind old man they turnedtheir horses heads and rode back out of the woods</s> after riding for three hours at a canter dick saw that althoughannie still spoke cheerfully her strength was failing her and onarriving at a wood he saidwe will wait here till the heat of the sun has abated</s>  we have donevery well and the horses as well as ourselves will be glad of a fewhours rest</s> he alighted from the saddle gave his horse to ibrahim and thenlifted annie from her seat</s>  as he set her down on her feet and loosedhis hold of her she slipped down on to the ground</s>  dick and surajahat once raised her and placed her so that as she sat she could leanagainst a tree</s> here dick supported her while surajah ran and fetched his waterbottle</s>  annie drank a little and then said with a nervous laughit is very silly of me</s>  but i feel better now</s>  my legs seemed to giveway altogether</s> it was not silly at all dick said</s>  you have held on most bravely</s> i can tell you there are not many girls who would have ridden four orfive and twenty miles the first time they sat on a horse</s>  why i cantell you the first time i mounted i did not do a quarter as much andi was so stiff i could hardly walk when i got down</s>  i should havestopped before but you kept talking so cheerfully that it seemed tome you could not be anything like as tired as i was then</s>  i was abrute not to have known that you must be thoroughly done up althoughyou did not say so</s> we have got some food with us</s>  do you think you could eat a little</s> she shook her head</s> not just yet</s> all right</s>  i have brought a couple of bottles of wine i got at one ofthe traders stores yesterday</s>  you must take a sip of that and thenwe will leave you to yourself for a bit and you must lie down andhave a good nap</s> dick took a bottle from his holster opened it and gave her some in atin cup</s>  then one of the rugs was spread on the ground with anotherone rolled up as a pillow and then they led the horses farther intothe wood leaving annie to herself</s> she wont be able to ride again tonight surajah said as they satdown while ibrahim took out the provisions that he had on theprevious day carried across to the farm</s> no i must carry her before me</s>  we will shift my saddle a littlefarther back and strap a couple of rugs in front of it so as to makea comfortable seat for her</s>  there is no doubt she will not be able toride again by herself</s>  i am sure that after my first days riding icould not have gone on again for anything</s> we wont start until it begins to get dusk</s>  of course she ought tohave a good twentyfour hours rest before she goes on but we darenot risk that</s>  i dont think there is any chance of pursuit for daysor indeed of any pursuit at all for by the time they begin tosuspect that we have really deserted they will know that we have hadtime to get to the frontier</s>  still i dont want to run the slightestrisk and at any rate if we have to halt it would be better to do sofifty miles farther on than here</s> when we mount again we will put the saddlebags from my horse on tohers and ibrahim must lead it</s>  her weight wont make much differenceto my horse and if i find it tiring i will change with you</s>  you mayas well put your saddlebags on to her horse also</s> it would be better would it not surajah said if you change toher horse which will have carried nothing</s> yes of course that would be best so you had better not shift yoursaddlebags</s> after they had had their meal they stretched themselves out for asleep and when they woke it was already becoming dusk</s>  the horses hadhad a good feed and were now given a drink of water from the skin</s> they were then saddled again the blankets carefully arranged forannies use and then they went back to the place where she was lyingstill asleep</s> put the provisions into the wallet again ibrahim</s>  we will see if wecan get her up without waking her</s>  she is so dead beat that perhapswe may do so</s>  i dont suppose she would be able to eat anything if wewoke her</s> i had better mount first</s>  then you surajah can lift her up to me</s>  ican stoop down and take her from your arms and put her in front ofme</s>  she is no weight to speak of</s> very gently surajah put his arms under the sleeping girl and liftedher</s> that is right dick said as he placed her on the blankets beforehim and held her with his right arm with her head against hisshoulder</s>  she is dead asleep</s> the blankets were strapped on to the horses again the others mountedand they started at a walk out of the wood</s>  as soon as they were onthe road the horses broke into a canter again</s>  annie moaned uneasilybut did not open her eyes</s>  dick drew her still more closely to him</s> she will do now surajah he said in a low voice</s>  i hope that shewill sleep till morning</s> half an hour later they rode through sultanpetta</s>  it was quite darknow and although there were people in the streets dick knew that atthe rate they were riding in the darkness the fact that he wascarrying a lad in front of him would scarce be noticed</s>  nor would itbe of any consequence if it were as even if they met any officer whoshould stop and question them it would suffice to say that the ladhad been taken ill and that their business being urgent they weretaking him on with them</s> four hours later they passed through conkanelly and crossed thebridge over a branch of the cauvery</s>  here dick felt that his horse wasflagging</s>  halting he dismounted and lifted annie down</s>  this time themovement woke her she gave a little cry</s> where am i</s>  she asked</s> you are quite safe child dick said cheerfully</s>  just lie quiet inmy arms</s>  we have come five hours journey and as my horse is gettingtired i am changing to yours</s>  ibrahim is shifting the rugs that youhave been sitting on</s> i can go on by myself she said making a little struggle to getdown</s> you must be good and do what you are told he said with a laugh</s> remember that you are a slave and i am your master at present</s> she said nothing more until they were seated afresh and had got intomotion</s> oh you are good dick</s>  she sighed softly</s>  only to think of yourcarrying me like this for five hours without waking me</s> well it was much better for us both that you should sleep he saidand it is the horse that is carrying you not i</s>  i have been verycomfortable i can assure you</s> we shall go on for another four hours</s>  after that we shall hide up ina wood and sleep till the afternoon</s>  then it will depend upon you</s>  ifyou can sit your horse we shall ride on through anicull</s>  if not wemust wait till it gets dark again and then go on as we are now</s>  areyou comfortable child</s> very comfortable dick</s> they were talking in english now for the first time since theystarted</s> i have almost forgotten how to talk english she said</s>  we whitegirls always used to talk it when we were together so as not toforget it and since the last one went three years ago i have alwaystalked it to myself for a bit before going to sleep so as to keepit up but it does not come anything like so easy as the other</s>  stilli like talking it to you</s>  it almost seems as if i were at home again</s> you see i have never heard a man talk english since i was carriedaway</s>  even now i can hardly believe this is not a happy dream andthat i shall not wake up presently and find myself a slave girl inthe harem</s> it is pleasant to me to talk english too dick said though it isonly a few months since i last spoke it</s>  now the best thing you cando is to try and get off to sleep again</s>  when we stop you shall havebreakfast</s>  i am sure you must want something</s>  you have had nothingsince you ate a mouthful or two in my room before starting</s> oh i have slept hours and hours</s>  she said</s>  i shall not want tosleep any more</s> however before long the easy motion lulled her off again and she didnot wake until at about four oclock in the morning they entered awood that was as dick supposed some three or four miles fromanicull</s> well how do you feel now</s>  dick asked as he set her on her feet</s> i feel stiff she said but that will soon wear off when i haverun about a little</s>  oh how tired you must be after carrying me allthese hours</s> there has not been much to hold dick said with a laugh especiallysince we started the last time</s>  before that you were so dead asleepthat i did have to hold you but you see you nestled up morecomfortably when we changed horses and needed very little supportsince then</s> now what can i do</s>  she asked with a little laugh</s>  please order meto do something</s>  i am your slave you know and i want to be helpingyou</s> well then i command you to aid me to gather some sticks for a fire</s> we have nothing to cook but it will be cheerful and the air iscool</s> they picked up sticks while surajah and ibrahim loosened the girthsof the horses took off their bridles and poured out another feedfrom the bag of grain they had brought with them</s>  in a few minutes afire was blazing and the wallet of provisions brought out</s> i wish i had a cup of coffee to offer you annie dick said as hepoured her out some wine and water but we must wait for that untilwe get down to tripataly</s> i have forgotten all about coffee dick and what it tastes like</s>  thewhite girls used to talk about it and say how they longed for a cup</s> it seems to me funny to drink anything hot</s>  i have never tastedanything but water that i can remember until you gave me that wineyesterday</s> it is very nice and very refreshing</s>  there is another drink that iscoming into fashion</s>  it is called tea</s>  i have tasted it a few timesbut i dont like it as well as coffee and it is much more expensive</s> the sultan says that all the english get drunk and there used to bepictures of them on the walls</s>  they used to make me so angry</s> i dont say that no english get drunk annie because there is nodoubt that some do</s>  but it is very far from being true of the greatproportion of them</s>  tippoo only says it to excite the people againstus because now that he has made them all mohammedans they cannotdrink wineat any rate openly</s>  when i bought these two bottles thetrader made a great mystery over it and if i had not given him a signhe understood and which made him believe that i was a hindoo and nota mussulman he would not have admitted that he kept it at all</s>  he didsay so at first for i have no doubt he thought that as i was anofficer of the palace it was a snare and that if he had admitted hehad wine i should have reported him and it would have served as anexcuse for his being fined and perhaps having all his goodsconfiscated</s>  when i made the sign that an old hindoo had taught mehis manner changed directly and he took me to the back of his littleshop and produced the wine</s>  i told him i wanted it for medicine andthat was quite true for i thought it was a drug you were very likelyto need on your journey</s> how much farther have we to ride</s>  she asked after a pause</s> only about thirtyfive milesthat is to say it is only thatdistance to the frontier</s>  there is a road that is rather more directbut it passes through oussoor a large town which we had betteravoid</s>  it is not more than fifty miles from the frontier to tripatalybut once across the line we can take matters easily and stop wheneveryou get tired</s> it will be all very strange to me dick</s>  i shant mind it as longas you are with me but it will be dreadful when you go</s>  i am afraidyour mother wont like me</s>  you see i know nothing of english waysand i am oh</s>  so ignorant</s>  i cannot even readat least very little</s> one of the girls used to teach me from a book she had when she wascarried off</s>  it was a bibleshe used to tell me stories out of it</s> but one day they found it and she was beaten very much forventuring to have it</s>  i am afraid i have quite forgotten even myletters but she and the other girls used to teach me about religionand told me i must never forget that i was a christian whatever theymight do to me and i was to say my prayers every night after i laydown and every morning before i got up</s>  of course i have always doneit</s> you need not be afraid of my mother annie</s>  she is very kind and iam sure she will take to you very much and will be very glad that ihave brought you to tripataly for you see she has no girls of herown</s>  she will teach you to read and write and if we go back toengland i dare say you will go to school for a time so as to learnthings like other girls</s> i can work very nicely she said</s>  the ladies of the harem all usedto say that</s> well you will find that very useful no doubt</s> and what else is there to learn</s>  she asked</s> no end of things annieat least there are no end of things forboys to learn</s>  i do not know anything about girls</s>  but of course youwill have to get to know something of history and geography</s> what is geography dick</s> well geography is where countries and places are</s>  for instance youknow something of the geography of india without ever having learntit</s>  you know that madras and the carnatic lie to the east andtravancore to the southwest and malabar to the west and the mahrattacountry and the nizams dominions to the north</s>  well that is thegeography of this part of the countrythat and the names of the townsand rivers</s>  in the same way there are a lot of nations in europe andyou want to know all about them and where they lie with respect toeach other and the names of their principal towns</s>  then there areamerica and africa and asia and all the countries in them</s>  if youdont know about these things you cant follow what people aretalking about</s> and did you like learning geography dick</s>  she asked a littleanxiously</s> well no i cant say that i did annie</s>  i think i used to hategeography</s>  it was very hard to remember where all the places were andwhat rivers they stood on</s>  i know very little about it now except theprincipal towns and places</s>  but then i never was very fond oflearning anything</s>  i was a very stupid boy at school</s> oh i am sure you could not have been that dick she saidconfidently</s> i was indeed annie</s>  i think the only thing i could do well wasfighting</s>  i was a beggar to fightnot because i used to quarrel withfellows but because it made me hard and tough and my mother thoughtthat it would make me more fit to carry out this search for myfather</s> what did you fight withswords</s>  annie asked</s> dick laughed</s> no no annie when we quarrel in england we fight with our fists</s> what is a fist</s>  i never heard of that weapon</s> that is a fist annie</s>  you see it is hard enough to knock a fellowdown though it does not very often do that but it hurts him a bitwithout doing him any harm except that it may black his eyes or puffup his face for a day or twoand no boy minds that</s>  it accustoms oneto bear pain and is a splendid thing for teaching a boy to keep histemper and i believe it is one reason why the english make such goodsoldiers</s>  it is a sort of science you see and one learns it just aspeople here learn to be good swordsmen</s>  i had lessons when i wastwelve years old from a little man who used to be a championlightweightthat is a man of not more than a certain weight</s> annie looked doubtful for a minute and then exclaimedah yes i understand now</s>  that is how it is you came to our help soquickly and bravely when the tiger burst in</s> i daresay it had something to do with it dick said with a smile</s> there is no doubt that boxing as we call it does make you quick</s> there is not much time to waste in thinking how you are to stop ablow and to return it at the same moment</s>  one gets into the habit ofdeciding at once what is the best thing to be done and i have nodoubt that i should not have seen at once that one must cut throughthe netting run to the window jump on to surajahs shoulders andfire at the tiger unless i had been sharpened up by boxing</s>  i onlysay i suppose that because there were no doubt hundreds of menlooking on who had pluck enough to face the tiger and who would havegladly done the thing that we did if the idea had occurred to them</s> the idea did not occur to them you see and i have no doubt that itwas just owing to that boxing that i thought of it</s>  so you see annieit was in a way the fights i had with boys at shadwellwhich is thepart of london where i livedthat saved you and perhaps half a dozenladies of the sultans harem from being killed by that tiger</s> now i should advise you to walk about the wood for at least an hourto get rid of your stiffness</s>  the longer you walk the better</s>  whenyou have tired yourself come back here</s>  by that time i daresay youwill be ready for another sleep</s>  we will start about three oclockand shall cross the frontier before it gets quite dark</s>  once acrosswe can camp comfortably where we like or put up at a village if weshould light upon one</s> i should not go far away from here he went on as the girl at oncerose and prepared to start</s>  very likely the wood may get thickerfarther in and you might lose your way or come across a snake so ishould not go far out of sight</s>  the great thing is to keep moving</s>  itis getting broad daylight now</s> as soon as annie had started dick lay down</s> i feel dog tired surajah</s>  this right arm of mine is so stiff that ican hardly lift it</s>  i did not feel it at the time and her weight wasnothing but i certainly feel it now</s> you have a good sleep dick</s>  ibrahim and i will keep watch byturns</s> i dont think there is any occasion for that dick said</s>  no one islikely to come into the wood</s> not very likely surajah agreed but a body of travellers mightturn in here for a halt in the middle of the day and it would lookstrange were they to find two of the palace officers and theirattendants all fast asleep</s> they would only think we came in for a rest a short time before theydid dick said drowsily</s>  still if you dont mind perhaps it wouldbe best</s> in two minutes dick was sound asleep</s> now ibrahim you lie down surajah said</s>  i will call you in threehours</s> in half an hour annie returned</s>  she looked pitifully at dick and thenseated herself by surajah</s> he must be tired she said</s>  it was too bad of me letting him carryme like that all night</s>  i thought so over and over again when hebelieved i was fast asleep but i knew that it was of no use askinghim to let me ride for a bit</s> you dont mind my sitting here for a little do you</s>  i am going awayagain presently</s>  i only came back so soon because i thought hemight wonder what had become of me if i did not</s>  i could have gone onwalking for a long time</s>  it was very hard work at first for my backached dreadfully and every step hurt me so it was as much as i coulddo to keep on walking but gradually it got better and at last i hada long run and after that i scarcely felt it</s> how long have you known him surajah</s>  and she nodded towards dick</s> it is about two years and a half since he came to tripataly and ihave seen a great deal of him ever since</s>  i love him very much</s>  he isalways the same</s>  he never seems to get angry and is kind toeveryone</s> did he fight when he was with the army</s> not much</s>  he was one of the generals own officers and used to ridewith the others behind him</s>  he fought in the battle beforeseringapatam for the general and every one else had to fight then</s> how is it you come to be always with him</s>  she asked</s> it first began when we went out on a scouting expedition togetherbefore the english army went up the ghauts</s>  we volunteered to findout if we could which way the sultans army was going</s>  we wentthrough a good deal of danger together and some hard fighting andthe sahib was pleased with me and since then we have always beentogether</s> tell me about that surajah</s> surajah related the story of their capture and escape of their makingtheir way through the fort and the subsequent pursuit and theirdefence of the ruined hut</s>  annie listened almost breathlessly</s> how i should like to have been with you she said when he finished</s> at least i think i should have liked it</s>  i should have beendreadfully in the way but i could have sat down in the hut and loadedthe guns while you were both fighting</s>  you could have shown me how todo it</s>  how brave of you both to have fought fifty or sixty men</s> it was not so very brave surajah said</s>  we knew we should bekilled if they took us</s>  there is nothing brave in doing your bestwhen you know that</s>  but it was not so much the fighting as arrangingthings and he did all that and i only carried out his orders</s>  healways seemed to know exactly what was best to be done and it wasentirely his doing our getting through the fort and taking to thehut and making the loopholes and blocking up the windows just as itwas his doing entirely that we killed that tiger</s>  whatever he saysis sure to be right and when he tells me to do a thing i do itdirectly for i trust him entirely and there is no need for me tothink at all</s>  if he had told me to go up to the sultan and shoot himin the middle of his officers i should have done it though theywould have cut me in pieces a minute afterwards</s> i will go away again now annie said getting up</s>  he told me tokeep on walking about and he would not like it if he were to wake upand find me sitting here</s> and she got up and strolled away again</s>  by the time she returnedsurajah had lain down to sleep and ibrahim was on watch</s>  annie wasby this time tired enough to be ready for sleep again and wrappingherself in a rug she lay down at a short distance from the others</s> it was two oclock when she awoke and she sprang to her feet as shesaw dick and surajah standing by the fire talking</s> i was going to wake you soon dick said as she joined them for wemust have another meal before we start</s>  i hope you feel all thebetter after your walk and sleep</s> ever so much better</s>  i scarcely feel stiff at all and shall be readyto ride as soon as you like</s>  how do you feel dick</s> oh i am all right annie</s>  i was all right before though i did feeli wanted a sleep badly and you see i have been having a long one fori only woke up ten minutes ago</s>  i own though that i should like agood wash</s>  i dont suppose i can look dirty through this stain but icertainly feel so</s> there is a pool she said a few hundred yards away there on theright</s>  i found it the second time i went away and i did enjoy awash</s> i thought you were looking wonderfully tidy dick said smiling</s> well i will go there at once</s>  i shall feel a new man after a bath</s> i will come with you surajah saidfor he had learned to speak agood deal of english during his companionship with dick</s> they returned in half an hour</s>  ibrahim had warmed up some of thechupatties over the ashes and they all thoroughly enjoyed theirmeal</s>  the horses were saddled and were taken to the pool for a gooddrink</s> then annie was helped into her saddle and they started again</s>  theyrode at a canter to anicull their badges of office securing them fromany questioning from the soldiers at the guard houses when theyentered and left the town</s> i dont know whether there is any post established at the frontierdick said as annie who had ridden behind with ibrahim as they passedthrough the town took her place again between him and surajah</s>  ihave no fear that they will be erecting a fort for after ourcapturing bangalore and the hill fortresses they will know very wellthat nothing they could build on the flat would be of the slightestuse in stopping an army advancing by this line</s>  still there may be aguard placed there</s> how do you think we had better get past surajah</s>  we have still gotthe order to the governors of forts and it is likely enough that theofficer in charge may not be able to read</s>  very few of those we metbefore were able to do so</s>  the sight of the sultans seal at thebottom was quite enough for them and i should think it would sufficeto pass us here</s>  still it would look suspicious our leaving the thecountry altogether and we must give some explanation if they ask us</s> i might say that we are charged with a mission to the englishcommander at kistnagherry</s> that might do surajah</s>  the fort is only eight or ten miles on theother side of the frontier and we might very well be sent on somemessage</s>  a complaint of some of the villagers that their rights havenot been respected as agreed by the treaty or that they have beenrobbed by men from this side of the frontierthere are plenty ofthings about which tippoo might be sending a message to kistnagherry</s> the worst of it is that tippoo has not given us a mission and i dohate your having to say what is not true</s> surajah was not so particular and he repliedwell he has given us a mission to visit the hill forts and askistnagherry is a hill fort it is not a very great stretch to includeit</s> dick laughed</s> that is ingenious surajah</s>  anyhow i dont see any better excuse forcrossing the frontier and so we must make the best of it but i hopewe shant be asked at all</s> i think if i say we are going to kistnagherry and then showtippoos order and seal that will be sufficient and the story willbe quite true for we shall go by kistnagherry as the road passesclose to the fortress</s> yes that will be quite true surajah and the officers are notlikely to ask any further questions</s> how are you getting on annie</s> oh much better than i did yesterday she said</s>  i would much rathernot halt until we are across the frontier</s>  i am getting accustomed tothe motion now and am not at all afraid of falling off</s>  i dare say ishall be rather stiff when we halt but that will not matter then</s> the sun was just setting when they arrived at a newlyerected houseround which ten or twelve tents were arranged</s>  an officer came out ofthe house as they approached</s>  he salaamed on seeing two officials ofthe palace wearing the emblems of the rank of colonels</s>  surajahreturned the usual moslem salutation</s> we are going to kistnagherry he said</s>  here is the sultans order</s> the officer glanced at the seal placed it to his forehead and thenstood aside</s> will you return tonight my lord</s>  i ask that i may give orders to thesentries</s> no there is no chance of our being able to be back before morning</s> he touched his horse and then trotted on again</s>  not a word wasspoken until they had gone a few hundred yards and then dick checkedhis horse and as annie came alongside held out his hand and saidthank god annie that we have got you safely back onto englishterritory</s> chapter 17 back at tripataly</s> annies lips moved as dick announced that they had crossed the mysoreboundary but no sound came from them</s>  he saw her eyes close and shereeled in the saddle</s> hold her surajah dick exclaimed or she will fall</s> leaning over surajah caught her by the shoulder and dick leaping tothe ground stopped her horse and lifting her from the saddleseated her upon a bank and supported her</s> some water surajah</s>  he exclaimed</s> surajah poured a little water from the skin into the hollow of dickshand and the latter sprinkled the girls face with it</s> i have not fainted she murmured opening her eyes but i turnedgiddy</s>  i shall be better directly</s> drink a little wine dick said</s> surajah poured some into a cup but with an effort she sat up andpushed it from her</s> there is nothing the matter she said</s>  only only and she burstsuddenly into a passion of sobbing</s> the spirit that she had shown so long as there was danger haddeserted her now that the peril had passed and she was safe</s> dick looked at her helplessly</s>  a girl in tears was a creature whollybeyond his experience and he had no idea what he ought to do in suchan emergency</s>  he therefore adopted what was doubtless the bestcourse had he but known it of letting her alone</s>  after a time theviolence of her crying abated and only short sobs broke from her asshe sat with her face hidden in her hands</s> that is right annie he said putting his hand on her shoulder</s>  itis quite natural for you to cry after the excitement and fatigue youhave gone through</s>  you have been very brave and have not said a wordof complaint today about your fatigue although you must bedesperately tired</s>  now try and pull yourself together</s>  it is gettingdark already and we ought to be moving on to ryacotta which cannotbe much more than a mile away</s>  you shall ride in front of me when weget there</s> i would rather not she said getting up with a painful effort</s>  iam awfully foolish and i am so sorry that i broke down but i felt sodelighted that i could not help it</s>  you said we could camp safelywhen we once got across the frontier</s>  would you mind doing so</s>  for idont think i could go much farther</s> certainly we can camp dick said cheerfully</s>  but we must get alittle bit farther from that post we passed</s>  if they were to see afire here they would be sure to suspect something</s>  i see a clump oftrees a quarter of a mile on</s>  we can make our camp there and i wouldrather do that myself than go on to ryacotta where our appearancein the mysore uniform would excite a stir and we should have no endof questions to answer</s> but i am sure that you are not fit to walk even that distance</s>  nowi will lift you on my saddle and you can sit sideways</s>  there i willwalk by your side and you can put your hand to my shoulder to steadyyourself</s>  surajah can lead your horse and his own and ibrahim cantake mine</s> in this way they performed the journey to the trees and then halted</s> annie was lifted down and laid on a rug</s>  dick insisted on herdrinking some wine and then covering her with another rug they lefther and lighted a fire fifty yards away</s> look here ibrahim put that whole chicken into the pan cover itwith water and let it stew</s>  dont let it boil fast but just simmeruntil it falls all to pieces</s>  then i will wake her if she has gone tosleep and make her drink the broth</s>  it will do her ever so much moregood than wine and she will be all right in the morning though nodoubt she will be desperately stiff again</s>  still it has not been alonger ride than she had yesterday</s>  i expect it is the excitementmore than the fatigue that has upset her</s>  tomorrow she must ride infront of me again</s> an hour and a half later dick went across with the cup full of strongbroth</s> are you asleep annie</s>  he said when he reached her side</s> no i am not asleep</s>  there is so much to think of and it is suchhappiness to know that i am free that i feel quite wide awake</s> besides you know i have been asleep for hours today and i slept allnight as i was riding before you</s> then sit up and drink this hot broth</s>  it will do you good</s>  and afterthat i hope you will go off</s>  you wont be fit for anything tomorrowif you dont have a good night</s>  you will have plenty of time to thinkas we ride along</s> the girl did as she was told</s> it is very nice she said as she handed the cup back to him</s>  ohdick i do hope that we shall find my father and mother</s>  i dont wantto for some things but i do for others and most of all that theymay thank you for all your goodness to me which i shall never be ableto do myself</s> nonsense child</s>  he said cheerfully</s>  i have done what every onewould do if they found a little countrywoman in distress</s>  i shouldhave gone away from seringapatam anyhow if i had not met you andgetting you down is a good excuse for me to go back and spend afortnight with my mother</s> now get off to sleep as quickly as you can</s>  we will see what we cando to make things comfortable for your ride tomorrow</s> it was late when annie awoke</s>  the sun was some distance above thehorizon and she saw her companions occupied with the horses</s>  in a fewminutes she joined them</s> i am ashamed at sleeping so long she said</s> we were glad to find that you did dick replied</s>  if you went tosleep soon after i brought you the broth you have had ten hours ofit and ought to feel all the better</s> i do she said</s>  i am very stiff but not so stiff as i wasyesterday morning</s>  how you are both altered</s> yes</s>  it would never have done to have gone on in our gay dresses andtippoos badges</s>  these are the clothes we came up in and we shallattract no attention whatever</s>  you wont have to ride far today</s>  itwill be as well for you to keep to your own horse until we havepassed through ryacotta which is not much more than half a mile away</s> after that you must sit on this pad i have fastened behind my saddle</s>
you can sit sideways you know and put your arm around me just asladies used to ride in england a couple of hundred years ago</s> as soon as they had eaten something they started and rode at a goodpace to the little town</s>  people looked at them somewhat curiously asthey passed through the street wondering that they should have comefrom mysore but as they did not halt no one asked any questions</s>  thepopulation were at present a good deal divided</s>  the great majorityby no means regretted their change of masters</s>  some of the mohammedanshad left when the place was taken over by the english and hadcrossed into mysore</s>  others had remained and hoped that ere longtippoo would drive back the british and regain his former dominions</s> before mounting the rich housings and the silver work on the bridleshad been removed and hidden among the rugs and there was nothingbeyond the excellence of two of the horses and the direction fromwhich they came to attract attention</s> when well beyond the town they halted</s>  the saddlebags were all packedupon annies horse</s>  dick lifted the girl on to the pad behind hissaddle and then mounted</s> now hold tight by me he said and mind whenever you are tired wewill halt for an hours rest</s>  we will not go more than twenty milestoday and then it will only be as much more down to tripatalytomorrow</s>  we will walk for a bit until you get quite accustomed toyour seat</s> after a while the horses broke into a gentle canter</s>  for a timeannie felt very doubtful as to whether she could retain her seat andso held tight with one arm to dick while with the other hand she kepta firm hold of the crupper</s>  presently however she was able torelease her hold of the latter and it was not long before she wasable honestly to assure dick that she felt quite comfortable andhad no fear of falling off</s> in two hours they passed near the hill on which stood the fortress ofkistnagherry which had successfully resisted the attack of theenglish but above which now flew the british flag</s>  skirting round thefoot they came in the course of an hour and a halfs ride on to thedirect road which they had left at anicull in order to avoid passingthrough the town of oussoor</s>  here they came upon a large village anddick found no difficulty in hiring a light native cart to take anniewho was as he felt by the relaxation of her hold unable to proceedfarther on horseback or continue straight through to tripataly</s> a thick layer of straw was placed at the bottom of the cart a coupleof rugs spread over it and on this annie was enabled to lie down ather ease</s>  the horses were fed and watered and had an hours rest andthen they started for the last twenty miles of their journey</s> annie had while the horses were resting a chat with a native womanand had gone into her house with her</s>  when they were ready for thestart she returned dressed in the costume she had worn in thepalace</s>  it had originally been intended to get rid of the clothesafter starting but annie had asked for them to be taken on</s> i can change again before i get to tripataly she said</s>  i shouldnot like to appear before your mother for the first time dressed asa boy</s> and dick had at once fallen in with her wishes</s> the turban was gone and her head was covered in the fashion of nativewomen with a long cotton cloth of a deep red colour</s> where the road was good the cart proceeded at a fair pace but in thepass down the ghauts they could go only at a walk and the sun had setbefore they reached tripataly</s>  dick seeing that annie was growingvery nervous as they neared their destination had ridden all the wayby the side of the cart chatting cheerfully with her</s> why annie he said you look as solemn as if you were just goinginto slavery instead of having escaped from it</s> it is not that i feel solemn dick</s>  it is that everything is so newand strange</s>  of course after your saving my life i have never feltthat you were a stranger and as long as there were only you andsurajah i did not mind and i have felt quite at home with you</s>  butnow that i am going to a new place where i dont know anyone i canthelp feeling desolate</s> you will feel quite as much at home with them in twentyfour hoursas you have done with me annie</s>  you are tired now and quite worn outwith your journey and so you take a gloomy view of things</s>  i willguarantee that before i go away again you will be good friends witheveryone and will wonder how you could have thought it to be anythingdreadful to come among them</s> when they got within a mile of tripataly dick saidnow i will ride on ahead annie and prepare my mother for yourcoming</s>  it will be pleasant to have no questions or explanations whenyou arrive and i am sure she will carry you straight off to bed andkeep you there until you have quite got over the effects of yourjourney</s> he did not wait to hear annies faint protest against his leaving herbut telling surajah to take his place beside the cart and to keeptalking to the girl he galloped on ahead</s>  he sprang from his horse inthe courtyard threw the reins to a servant and ran in</s>  the party hadjust sat down to their evening meal and as he entered he was greetedby exclamations of astonishment and welcome</s> his mother had received two letters sent through pertaub by tradersgoing down from seringapatam</s>  in these he had told her first of hisarrival and of the adventure with the tiger and of his obtaining thepost in the palace and in the second of the nonsuccess that hadattended his visits to the hill forts</s>  he had told her that he shouldprobably leave seringapatam shortly and continue the search but thatshe must not anticipate any result for a long time</s> well mother he said after the first embrace and greetings wereover i have left tippoos service you see and am no longer acolonel or an officer of the palace</s>  i have come down to spend afortnight with you before i set out again on my travels</s> has surajah come back with you dick</s>  the rajah asked</s> yes</s>  he will be here in a few minutes with a cart</s>  that is one ofthe reasons why i came down here</s>  i found among the slaves of theharem a white girl about fourteen years old</s>  she is the daughter of abritish officer named mansfield and was carried away from herparents eight years ago</s>  she was the only white captive left in thepalace</s>  there have been other girls in a similar position but theyhave all at about fourteen or fifteen been given by tippoo to hisofficers as would have been her fate before long so i determined tocarry her off with me and bring her to you until we could find herparents</s>  she is a very plucky girl and although she had never beenon a horse before rode all the way down until we got this side ofkistnagherry</s>  but as you may imagine the poor little thing iscompletely knocked up so we brought her down from there in a cart</s> it is something mother to have saved one captive from tippoosgrasp even though it is not the dear one that i was looking for andi promised that you would be a mother to her until we could restoreher to her friends</s> certainly i will dick mrs</s>  holland said warmly</s> will you tell the girls gholla she said to her sisterinlaw tohave a bed made up for her in my room</s> i will do so at once the ranee said</s>  poor little thing she musthave had a journey indeed</s> she will be here directly mother dick said as his aunt gave thenecessary directions for the bed to be prepared and a dish of riceand strong gravy</s>  she is very nervous and i am sure it will be bestif you will meet her when she arrives and take her straight to herroom</s> that is what i was going to do dick his mother said with a smile</s> well i will go down with you at once</s> two or three minutes later the cart entered the courtyard</s>  mrs</s> holland was on the steps</s>  dick ran down and helped annie from thecart</s>  the girl was trembling violently</s> dont be afraid annie dick whispered as he lifted her down</s>  hereis my mother waiting to receive you</s> this is the young lady he went on cheerfully as he turned to hismother</s>  i promised her a warm welcome in your name</s> mrs</s>  holland had already come down the steps and as the girl turnedtowards her she took her in her arms and kissed her in motherlyfashion</s> welcome indeed she said</s>  i will be a mother to you poor childtill i can hand you over to your own</s>  i thank god for sending you tome</s>  it will be a comfort to me to know that even if my son shouldnever bring my husband back to me he has at least succeeded inrescuing one victim from tippoo and in making one family happy</s> the girl clung to her crying softly</s> oh how good you all are</s>  she sobbed</s>  it seems too much happinessto be true</s> it is quite true dear</s>  come with me</s>  we will go up the privatestairs and i will put you straight to bed in my room and no one elseshall see you or question you until you are quite recovered fromyour fatigue</s> i am afraid annie began faintly</s> she did not need to say more</s>  mrs</s>  holland interrupted her</s> dick you must lift her up and carry her into my room</s>  poor childshe is utterly exhausted and no wonder</s> a couple of minutes later dick returned to the dining room</s>  he hadrun down first to tell surajah to come up with him but found thathe had already gone to his fathers apartments</s> well dick the rajah said as he entered i was prepared afterhearing of that tiger adventure and of you and surajah being colonelsin tippoos household for almost anything but i certainly neverdreamt of your returning here with an english girl</s> i suppose not uncle</s>  such a thing certainly never entered into mycalculations</s>  i did not even know there was a white girl in thepalace until one day she stopped me as i was passing along thecorridor near the harem to thank me for saving her lifefor it wasthis girl that the tiger had struck down and was standing upon wheni fired at him</s>  of course she had no idea that i was english</s>  we onlysaid a few words then for if i had been seen talking to a slave girlbelonging to the harem i might have got into a scrape</s>  however i sawher afterwards and she told me about herself and how she was afraidthat she would be given away to one of tippoos officers</s>  of course icould not leave her to such a fate as that</s> there was really no difficulty in getting her away</s>  she was dressedas a boy and only had to ride with our servant after us</s>  we hadarranged so that our absence would not be noticed until we had beenaway for at least twentyfour hours and of course as officers of thepalace no one questioned us on the journey so that it is a verysimple affair altogether and the only difficulty there was rose fromher being completely tired out and exhausted by the journey as shewas utterly unaccustomed to travelling</s>  i had to carry her one nightin front of me on my saddle for she was scarce able to stand</s> i am not surprised at that</s>  a journey of a hundred and fifty milesto anyone who has never been on horseback would be a terrible trialespecially to a young girl</s>  i really wonder that she did not breakdown altogether</s>  why you can remember how stiff you were yourselfthe first day or two you were here and that after riding only an houror two</s> i know uncle and i should not have been in the least surprised ifshe had collapsed</s>  i talked it over with surajah and we agreed thatif she could not go on we must hire a vehicle of some sort and lether travel every day in front of us with ibrahim and that if itdelayed us so much that there was any possibility of our beingovertaken we would have put on our peasants dresses got rid of ourhorses and have gone forward on foot</s> however she kept up wonderfully well and always made the best ofthings</s> we wont ask you to tell us anything more dick till your motherjoins us or you will have to go over the story twice</s> no uncle and i can assure you i dont want to tell the story untili have had my supper for our meals have not been very comfortable onthe road and i have not eaten anything since early this morning</s> what is tippoo doing dick</s> well as far as i can see uncle he is preparing for war again</s>  heis strengthening all his forts building fresh defences toseringapatam and drilling numbers of fresh troops</s> the english general made a great mistake in not finishing with himwhen he was there</s>  we ought to have taken the city sent tippoo down aprisoner to madras and there tried him for the murder of scores ofenglishmen and hung him over the ramparts</s>  we shall have all our workto do over again in another four or five years</s>  however it will notbe such a difficult business as it was last time now that we have thepasses in our hands</s> there is no doubt uncle that a considerable part of the populationwill be heartily glad when tippoos power is at an end</s>  you see heand hyder were both usurpers and had no more right to the throne thanyou had</s> quite so dick and that makes our letting him off when we couldhave taken the capital easily all the more foolish</s>  if he had beenthe lawful ruler of mysore it might not have been good policy to pushhim too hard for he would have had sympathy from all the nativeprinces of india</s>  but as being only the son of an adventurer who haddeposed and illtreated the lawful ruler of mysore it would seem tothem but a mere act of justice if the english had dethroned him andpunished himprovided of course they put a native prince on thethrone and did not annex all his dominions</s> it has all got to come some day</s>  i can see that in time the englishwill be the rulers of all india but at present they are not strongenough to face a general coalition of the native states against themand any very highhanded action in mysore might well alarm thenative princes throughout india into laying aside their quarrelswith each other and combining in an attempt to drive them out</s> just as they had finished their meal mrs</s>  holland entered</s> the poor child is asleep she said</s>  she wanted to talk at firstand to tell me how grateful she was to you dick but of course iinsisted on her being quiet and said that she should tell me allabout it in the morning</s>  she ate a few mouthfuls of the rice and notlong after she lay down she fell asleep</s>  i have left sundra sittingthere in case she should wake up again but i dont think it islikely that she will do so</s> now dick you must tell us all about it</s> dick was not a great hand at writing letters so he had not enteredwith any fullness into the details of what he was doing theprincipal point being to let his mother know that he was alive andwell</s> before he begins the rajah said i will send for rajbullub andsurajah</s>  master dick is rather fond of cutting his stories short andwe must have surajah here to fill up details</s> surajah and his father soon appeared</s>  the former was warmly greeted bythe rajah and when they had seated themselves on a divan dickproceeded to tell the story</s>  he was not interrupted until he came tothe incident of the killing of the tiger and here surajah was calledupon to supplement the story which he did doing full credit to thequickness with which dick had without a moments loss of time cutthe netting and ascended to the window</s> when dick came to the incident of the ladies of the harem presentingthem in tippoos presence with the two caskets mrs</s>  holland brokeinyou did not say anything about that in your letter dick</s>  let me seeyour casket</s>  where is it</s> it is in one of the saddlebags dick said</s> they are in my room rajbullub corrected</s>  surajah brought them upat once</s> then he had better get them the rajah said</s> what do they contain dick</s>  he asked as surajah left the room</s> all sorts of thingsnecklaces and rings</s>  some of them are stones asif they had been taken out of their settings</s>  pertaub said they haddone this because they thought perhaps that tippoo would not allowthe jewels they had worn to be sold or worn by anyone else</s> then i should think that they must be valuable the ranee said</s> pertaub said they were worth a good deal but i dont know whether hereally knew about the cost of precious stones</s>  some of the things wereof small value being i suppose the trinkets of the slave girls</s>  allgave something and there is a little cross there that belonged toannie</s>  it has her initials on it and she had it on her neck when shewas captured</s>  it was the thing she valued most and therefore she gaveit</s>  i dont suppose she had anything else except the usual trinketsshe would wear when she went out on special occasions with the ladiesof the harem</s>  i thought it would be useful to us to prove who shewas</s> surajah now returned with the casket</s> you had better look at surajahs first dick said</s>  i dont knowanything about it but it looks as if mine were the more valuable</s>  iwanted surajah to put them all together and divide fairly but hewould not</s> my son was perfectly right rajbullub said</s>  if it had not been forthe young lord the deed would never have been done at all</s>  surajahaided in killing the tiger but that was nothing more than he has doneon the hills here</s>  it is to you the merit is entirely due</s>  the pursethat the sultan gave my son was in itself an ample reward for theshare he took in it</s> now surajah open your casket</s>  the ladies are waiting to see thecontents</s> the whole of the little packets some fifty in number were opened andexamined many of them eliciting exclamations of admiration from theranee and mrs</s>  holland</s> there is no doubt that many of them are worth a good deal of moneythe rajah said</s>  it is certain that tippoos treasuries are full ofthe spoils he has carried off from the states he has overrun and theladies of the harem no doubt possess a store of the jewels andcould afford to be liberal to those whom they considered had savedtheir lives</s>  those seven which you put together as the best mustalone be worth a large sum</s>  i should think that the total value of thewhole cannot be less than forty or fifty thousand rupees so that ifthose in your casket are handsomer than these dick they must bevaluable indeed</s> dicks casket was next examined</s> some of these stones are magnificent dick</s>  those three greatdiamonds could only be valued by a jeweller accustomed to such thingsfor their value depends upon their being of good lustre and free fromall flaws but according to my judgment i should say that at thevery least they must be worth ten thousand rupees each</s>  that pearlnecklace is worth at least as much</s>  those rubies are superb</s>  i shouldsay lad that the value of the whole cannot be less than fifteenthousand pounds</s> the harem must be rich in jewels indeed to be able to make suchgifts</s>  not that i am surprised at that</s>  tippoo had all the jewelsbelonging to the lawful rulers of mysore</s>  he has captured all those ofcoorg travancore and the other states on the malabar coast</s>  he andhis father have looted all the carnatic from cape comorin to thenorth of madras</s>  he has captured many of the nizams cities andseveral mahratta provinces</s> in fact he has accumulated at seringapatam the spoils of the wholeof southern india and those of the hindoo portion of his own people</s> the value of the jewels alone must be millions of pounds and as hehimself as they say dresses simply and only wears one or two gemsof immense value he may well have bestowed large quantities upon hisharem especially as these would be in fact only loans as at thedeath of their wearers they would revert to him or indeed could bereclaimed at any moment in a freak of bad temper</s> i have no doubt they had to ask his permission to give you thepresents and as you at the moment were in high favour with him idaresay he suffered them to give what they chose without inquiring atall into their value</s>  the gold he gave you was simply to procure youroutfits and he left it to the harem to reward you as they chose forthe service you had rendered</s> well dick i congratulate you heartily</s>  it places your future beyonddoubt and leaves you free to choose any mode of life that you mayprefer</s> i congratulate you too margaret on the lads good fortune whichhe has well deserved by his conduct</s> see this my sons</s>  here you have a proof of the advantages of thetraining your cousin has had</s>  the quickness and coolness he hasacquired by it enabled him to make his way down through the fort atthe top of the pass and to defend the ruined hut against fiftyenemies</s>  now it has enabled him to seize the opportunity opened bythe attack of the tiger on tippoos harem thereby gaining thesultans favour his appointment to the rank of colonel in the mysorearmy a post in his palace and this magnificent collection of gems</s> without that quickness and decision his courage alone would have donelittle for him</s>  we in india have courage but it is because ourprinces and nobles are brought up in indolence and luxury that theenglish though but a handful in point of numbers have become mastersof such wide territories</s>  surajah is as brave as dick but he would bethe first to tell you that it is to dick he owes it that on theirfirst excursion together he escaped with his life and that in thislast adventure he attained rank and position and has returned withthese valuable gifts</s> it is indeed my lord surajah said</s>  the young lord has been myleader and i have tried to carry out his orders</s>  alone i could neverhave got through the gate in the fort and should no more have thoughtof going to the assistance of the ladies of the sultans harem thandid any other of the thousands of men who were there looking on</s> so you see boys the rajah went on that though when he came outhere your cousin was able neither to shoot nor to ride and canneither shoot nor ride as well now as can tens of thousands ofnatives he has acquired from his training in rough exercisesqualities of infinitely greater value than these accomplishments andi do hope that his example will stir you up to take much greaterinterest than in spite of my advice you have hitherto done in activesports and exercises</s>  your grandmother was an englishwoman and i wantto see that with the white blood in your veins you have some of thevigour and energy of englishmen</s> it was some days before annie mansfield left her room</s>  for the firsttwo she had been completely prostrated</s>  after that she rapidly gainedstrength but mrs</s>  holland thought it best to insist upon herremaining perfectly quiet until she had quite recovered</s>  either sheor the ranee were constantly with her so that when at the end of aweek she made her first appearance at the breakfast table she wasalready at home with three of the party</s> before long her shyness completely wore off and she seemed to havebecome really a member of the family</s>  mrs</s>  holland had altered two ofher own dresses to fit her but she preferred for a time to dress inindian costume to which she was accustomed and which was indeedmuch better suited to the climate than the more closelyfittingeuropean dress</s>  mrs</s>  holland however bargained that she should ofan evening wear the frocks she had made for her</s> you must get accustomed to them my dear so that when you find yourown people you will not be stiff and awkward as you certainly willbe when you dress in english fashion for the first time</s> the day after his arrival dick had written to the military secretaryof the governor of madras with whom he was well acquainted to tellhim that having gone up in disguise to seringapatam to endeavour toascertain the fate of his father he had discovered a young englishgirl detained as a slave in tippoos harem and that he had enabledher to effect her escape and had placed her in the charge of hismother</s>  he then repeated the account annie had given of her captureand asked if the circumstances could be identified and if theofficer of the name of mansfield concerned in it was still aliveand if so was he still in india</s> annie was secretly dreading the arrival of the answer</s>  after her lifeas a slave her present existence seemed to her so perfectly happythat she shrank from the idea of any fresh change</s>  she had no memorywhatever of her parents and had already a very strong affection formrs</s>  holland</s>  she liked the ranee very much also and the absence ofall state and ceremony in the household of the rajah was to herdelightful</s>  she was already on good terms with the boys and as todick she was always ready to go out with him if he would take herto run messages for him or to do anything in her power and indeedwatched him anxiously as if she would discover and forestall hisslightest wish</s> one would think annie he said one day that you were still aslave and that i was your master</s>  i dont want you to wait on mechild as you waited on the ladies of the harem</s>  however as i shallbe going away in a few days now it does not matter but i should growas lazy as a young rajah if this were to go on long</s> what shall i do when you go away dick</s> well i hope that you will set to work hard to learn to read andwrite and other things my mother will teach you</s>  you would not likewhen you find your own people to be regarded by girls of your own ageas an ignorant little savage and i want you to set to and make upfor lost time so that if you are still here when i come back ishall find you have made wonderful progress</s> oh i do hope i shant be gone before that dick</s> i am afraid you must make up your mind to it annie for there is nosaying how long i may be away next time</s>  you see there is not muchchance of my lighting upon another white slave girl and having tobring her down here and i shall go in for a long steady search formy father</s> i dont want you to find another slave girl dick she saidearnestly not even if it brought you down here again</s>  i should notlike that at all</s> why not annie</s> oh you might like her ever so much better than me</s>  i should like youto do all sorts of brave things dick and to save people as you havesaved me but i would rather there was not another girl</s> dick laughed</s> well i dont suppose that there is much chance of it</s>  besides icant turn my uncles palace into a home for lost girls</s> two days before dick and surajah started again the reply from themilitary secretary arrived</s>  it stated that the time and circumstancespointed out that the place besieged and forced to surrender eightyears before was corsepan and this was indeed rendered a certaintyby the fact that the officer in command was captain mansfield</s>  he hadwith him a half company of europeans and three companies of sepoys</s> on looking through the official papers at the time he had foundcaptain mansfields report in which he stated that on the nightafter leaving the fort the troops which had been reduced to halftheir original strength had been attacked by a party either ofdacoits or irregular troops</s>  fearing that some such act of treacherymight be attempted he had told his men to conceal a few cartridgesunder their clothes when they marched out with empty cartridgepouches</s>  they had on arriving at their halting place loaded andwhen the dacoits fell upon them had opened fire</s> the robbers doubtless expected to find them defenceless and speedilyfled</s>  in the confusion some of them had penetrated far into the campand had carried off the captains daughter a child of six years old</s> when peace was signed with tippoo three weeks afterwards thecommissioners were ordered to make special inquiries as to this childand to demand her restoration</s>  they reported that tippoo denied allknowledge of the affair and neither she nor any of the other girlsthere were ever given up</s>  the letter went onthere can be no doubt that the young lady you rescued is the childwho was carried off and the initials you speak of on the cross maycertainly be taken as proof of her identity</s>  her father retired fromthe service last year with the rank of colonel</s>  i am of courseignorant of his address</s>  as you say that mrs</s>  holland will gladlycontinue in charge of her i would suggest that you should write aletter to colonel mansfield stating the circumstances of the caseand saying that as soon as you are informed of his address the younglady will be sent to england</s>  i will enclose the letter in one to theboard of directors briefly stating the circumstances and requestingthem to forward the enclosure to colonel mansfield</s> to annie the letter came as a relief</s>  it would be nearly a yearbefore a letter could be received from her father</s>  until then shewould be able to remain in her new home</s> chapter 18 a narrow escape</s> mrs</s>  holland undertook to write the letter to annies father and didso at very much greater length than dick would have done giving himthe story of the girls life at seringapatam the circumstances of hermeeting dick and the story of her escape</s>  she assured him that hisdaughter was all that he could wish her to be</s> she is of a very affectionate disposition</s>  she is frank outspokenand naturalqualities that are wonderful considering the years shehas passed as a slave in the harem</s>  now that she has been with us fora fortnight and has recovered from the fatigue of her flight and isbeginning to feel at home she has regained her natural spirits aftertheir long repression</s> personally she is of about the average height and of a moregraceful figure than is usual with girls of her age</s>  the stain has nowworn off her face and i should say she will as she grows up bepretty</s>  she is fair rather than dark has expressive eyes and a nicemouth</s>  altogether had i a daughter i should be well content if sheresembled your annie</s>  i shall i can assure you do my best to supplythe place of a mother to her until i receive a letter from you andshall part from her with regret</s>  she is of course at presententirely uneducated but she has already begun to learn with me andas she is quick and intelligent i hope that before i resign mycharge her deficiencies will be so far repaired that she will be ableto pass muster in all ordinary matters</s> you will be back before i go wont you dick</s>  annie said as shesat by his side on a seat in the garden on the evening before he wasto start</s> i think so he said</s>  we can calculate on your being here tenmonths anyhow</s>  i have been talking it over with my mother</s>  if it hadnot been for those jewels i should have given up the search for myfather after another six months because it would have been high timefor me to get to work in some profession</s>  i had indeed made up mymind to enter the companys service for lord cornwallis promised me acommission and my uncle received a letter some time ago from thegovernor of madras saying that on the very strong recommendation oflord cornwallis and his report of my services he was authorised togrant me one</s>  it was to be dated back to the time i joined lordcornwallis more than two years ago</s>  however now that i am reallymade independent of a profession i shall probably continue my searchfor a somewhat longer time</s>  but at any rate i will promise to comeback at the end of ten months from the present time so as to saygoodbye to you before you start</s> the girls face brightened</s> thank you dick</s>  i dont think i should go anyhow until i saw youagainnot even if i got a letter saying that i was to sail by thenext ship</s> my uncle would take you down bodily and put you on board dicklaughed</s>  mind annie when i come back at the end of ten months ishall expect to find you quite an educated young lady</s>  i shall thinkof all sorts of hard questions in geography and history to put toyou</s> i will try hard dick really hard to please you</s>  i have had threelessons and i have learnt all the letters quite well</s> that is a good beginning annie</s>  it took me a lot longer than that iknow</s> the next morning dick and surajah started</s>  they were to ride up theghauts to the frontier line at amboor two troopers accompanying themto bring back their horses</s>  there they were to disguise themselves astraders and make their way direct to bangalore</s>  dick said goodbye tohis mother up in her own room</s> you must not be downhearted mother he said as she tried in vainto keep back her tears</s>  you see i have come back to you twicesafely and after passing unsuspected in tippoos palace there is nofear of my being detected elsewhere</s>  besides of course every month iam there i become better acquainted with the people and can pass as anative more easily</s> i am not really afraid my boy</s>  you have got on so well that itseems to me god will surely protect you and bring you back safely</s> and i cant help thinking that this time your search may besuccessful</s>  you know why i feel convinced that your father is stillalive and in spite of past disappointments i still cling to thebelief</s> well mother if he is to be found i will find him</s>  there are stillmany hill forts where he may be living and his very existenceforgotten and until i have visited every one of them i dont mean togive up the search</s>  anyhow i shall come back at the end of tenmonths whether i have heard of him or not</s>  i have promised annie thati will be back before she sails</s>  it is not a very long journey downhere and i shall drop in for a fortnights stay with you as i havedone this time</s> she is in the next room crying her eyes out dick</s>  you had betterlook in there and say goodbye to her</s>  she is not fit to go down tothe door</s> after parting with his mother dick went in to see annie</s> you must not cry so child he said as she rose from the divanwith her face swollen with crying</s>  i am sure that you will be veryhappy here until i come back</s> i know dick but it wont be at all the same without you</s> oh you will have plenty to do and you will soon fall into regularways</s>  besides you know you have got to comfort my mother and keepup her spirits and i quite rely upon you to do that</s> i will try dick she said earnestly</s> now goodbye annie</s> he held out his hand but she threw her arms round his neck andkissed him</s> you have never kissed me not once she said reproachfully and youwere going away without it now</s>  your mother kisses me and theenglish girls in the harem always used to do so</s> but that is different annie</s>  girls and women do kiss each other butboys and girls do not kiss unless they are brothers and sisters orare relations or something of that sort</s> but you are not a boy</s>  you are a great big man dick</s> i am not much more than a boy yet annie</s>  however there is no harmin kissing when one is saying goodbye so there</s> now be a good girl and dont fret and he ran downstairs to thedoor where his uncle and the two boys were standing</s> take care of yourself lad the rajah said as after bidding themgoodbye dick sprang upon his horse</s>  whenever you get a chance senddown a letter as we arranged last night to the care of azol afooltrader tripataly</s>  that will seem natural enough whoever you send itby while a letter directed to me might excite suspicion</s> goodbye</s> goodbye uncle and with a wave of his hand dick rode off andjoined surajah who was waiting for him a short distance off</s>  andthen followed by ibrahimwho had begged so earnestly to be allowedto accompany them that dick had consented to take him feeling indeedthat his services would be most useful to themand the two troopersthey rode off at a sharp pace</s> at amboor they assumed their disguises</s>  dick purchased a pack ponyand some goods suitable to their appearance as pedlers and then theystarted up the pass on foot</s>  they passed the frontier line without anyinterruption stopped and chatted for a few minutes with the guardand then passed on up the valley</s> there is the house where we had our fight surajah dick said asthey reached the ruined village</s>  though there is peace now i fancywe should not get much farther than that fort ahead if they guessedthat we were the fellows who gave them such trouble two years and ahalf ago</s> there is no fear of our being recognised surajah said</s>  the guardhas probably been changed long ago</s>  besides they never once caughtsight of our faces</s> oh no we are safe enough dick agreed</s>  if i had not been sure ofthat we would have gone up one of the passes to the south that hasbeen ceded to us though it would have been a great deal longer roundto bangaloreunless indeed we had gone by kistnagherry and thatwould have been too dangerous to attempt for the officers on thefrontier would probably have recognised us</s> it was late in the afternoon before they arrived at the gate</s>  it stoodopen and there was no sentry on duty</s>  a few soldiers could be seenloitering about in the street but it was evident that now the warwas over and everything finally settled it was considered that alloccasion for vigilance was at an end</s> upon making inquiries they soon found a house where they could put upfor the night</s>  they had as is the custom in india brought theirprovisions with them and after leaving their goods in the house andseeing that the horse was fed ibrahim set to work to cook a mealwhile the others opened one of the packs and went round the villagewhere they disposed of a few small articles</s> they arrived without any adventure at bangalore</s>  there as soon asthey had established themselves at one of the caravansaries fortravellers dick and surajah went to the house of the trader to whompertaub had promised to consign their goods</s> we have come for some packs that have been sent by friends of oursat seringapatam to your care dick said making as he spoke the signthat pertaub had taught him as enabling those who were hindoos torecognise each other at once</s>  we were to use the word madras as asign that we were the parties to whom they were consigned</s> the goods arrived a week ago the trader said and are lying foryou at my warehouse</s>  i will hand them over to you tomorrow morning</s> thank you</s>  we may not come early for we have to purchase two packhorses to carry them and three tats for ourselves and our man</s>  thismay take us some time and it will be perhaps better for us to cometo you early the next morning and we can then start away direct</s> this was arranged and on the following day two strong animals werebought for the packs and three tats or ponies for their own riding</s> dick had disposed of the horse he had ridden down to tripataly for agood price and had also been supplied with funds by his motheralthough as he said the contents of their packs ought to suffice topay all their expenses for a long time</s> then they purchased some provisions for the journey</s>  the pack horsethey had brought with them was laden with these and the goods broughtup from amboor</s>  the new pack horses were taken round to the tradersand the goods sent from seringapatam packed on them</s>  then they mountedand rode off at a walk the pack animals following ibrahims horsetied one behind the other</s> they had already debated upon the course to pursue and finallydecided that they would in the first place again visit savandroogfor the conviction dick had entertained that there was at least onewhite captive there had increased rather than diminished</s> i cant give any good reason for it surajah he had admitted whenthey talked it over before starting but it is just because i have nogood reason to give that i want to go there again</s>  why should i havesuch a strong conviction without a good cause</s>  one has heard of apresentiment of evili cant help feeling that this is a presentimentof good</s>  the question is how can we best go there again</s>  i dontthink it is in the least likely that the governor will have heard ofour flight as this would be the last direction anyone would think ofour taking for had we done so we might have met the sultan on hisway back from bangalore</s>  it will naturally be supposed that we havemade for the frontier and have descended the western or southernghauts</s>  the affair will of course seem a mystery to them altogetherfor why should two young fellows so recently promoted and in suchhigh favour desert tippoos service</s>  if they do not associate anniesdisappearance with our flightand there is no reason on earth whythey should do so as no one ever saw us speaking to herthey willmost likely think that we have fallen into the hands of the dacoitsor thugs and have been murdered</s>  numbers of people do disappear everyyear and are as everyone supposes victims of that detestable sect</s> my uncle has told me of thugs</s>  he warned me to be very careful if itravelled with strangers for that these men travel in all sorts ofdisguises</s> so i think that as far as that goes we could boldly put on ouruniforms and badges again and ride into savandroog</s>  the disadvantageof doing so is however plain</s>  the commander would remain with us allthe time</s>  we should get no opportunity of speaking privately with anyof the soldiers and taking us to be in tippoos confidence hewould as before shirk the question of prisoners</s>  on the other handif we can get in as traders we shall be able to move aboutunwatchedto go to the soldiers huts and offer goods to their wivesand be able to find out to a certainty if there is a prisoner thereand if so where he is kept</s>  we may even see him for while if thegovernor wished to keep his existence a secret he would have shut himup when he heard that two of tippoos officers were coming he wouldnot trouble about it one way or the other in the case of a couple oftraders</s> the only objection to that course is that we were here but two orthree months since and he and his servants and that artilleryofficer we went round with would know us at once</s>  if we go we shallhave to alter our appearance completely</s>  at any rate we had betterprovide means for disguise and we can use them or not as weplease</s> while they were at tripataly therefore they had two false beardsmade for themselves and tried many experiments in the way of paintingtheir faces and found that by tracing light lines on their foreheadsand at the corners of their eyes they were able by the help ofbeards to counterfeit the appearance of old age so well that itcould only be detected on close observation</s>  dick too had purchaseda pair of native spectacles with large round glasses and broadblackhorn rims that made him look as he said like an astonishedowl</s>  it was agreed that surajah should wear under his dress a verythickly padded vest which would give him the appearance of being fatas well as elderly</s> they proceeded for seven or eight miles at a walking pace and whenthe heat of the day rendered it necessary for them to stop turnedinto a grove by the roadside as they had no intention of going on tosavandroog that day intending to halt some miles short of it and topresent themselves there the next afternoon</s>  they therefore preparedfor a stay of some hours</s>  the pack horses were unloaded and thesaddles taken off the other animals</s> half an hour later a party of twelve men travelling in the samedirection as themselves also halted and turned in among the trees</s> the man who was apparently the leader of the party came across towhere they were sitting</s> we do not disturb you i hope brothers</s>  he said</s>  the grove islarge enough for us all</s>  i see that you are traders like myself</s> by no means surajah replied</s>  the wood is open to all and evenwere it not we should be discourteous indeed did we refuse to shareour shade with others</s>  sit down by us i beg of you while your peopleare unloading your animals</s> i marked you as you left bangalore the trader said as he seatedhimself beside them and when i saw that you were taking the sameroute that we should follow i wondered how far our roads might lietogether</s> we are travelling west surajah replied</s>  it may be that we shallstop at magree and there or at outradroog stop for a day or two totrade</s>  thence we may go north</s> then as far as outradroog our paths will lie together the merchantsaid</s>  there we shall strike the river and turn south toseringapatam</s>  i am sorry that you will not be going farther in ourdirection for the roads are far from safe</s>  since the war with theferinghees ended there are many disbanded soldiers who have taken todacoity and it is always better to travel with a strong band</s>  iwonder that you venture with three loaded animals and only one manbeside yourselves</s> surajah was about to speak but a quick glance from dick stopped him</s> we think there is less danger in travelling in a small body thanthere is with a large one the latter said</s>  there is less to temptanyone to interfere with us</s>  moreover we could not travel with acaravan because the greater part of our goods are such as would temptthe peasantry only</s>  we therefore stop at small villages to tradeleaving the towns to those who travel with more valuable merchandise</s> after chatting for some minutes the traveller got up and joined hisparty</s> i dont much like that fellows looks dick said when they werealone</s> why</s>  he looks a very respectable man</s> oh yes he looks respectable enough but for all that i dont fancyhim</s>  it may be that he regards us as rivals and was only trying tofind out where we intended to stop and whether we were likely tospoil his trade</s>  that was why i said what i did so that he mightperceive that we were not likely to interfere with him</s> then again surajah i remembered my uncles warning against joiningother travellers as these thugs who they say commit so manymurders generally travel in bands disguised sometimes as traderssometimes as men seeking work sometimes as disbanded soldiers</s> anyhow it is as well to be careful</s>  we have each got a brace ofdoublebarrelled pistols in our girdles in addition to these oldsinglebarrelled indian ones that we carry for show and our swordsare leaning against the tree behind us so we can get hold of them ina moment</s>  i know of course that the betting is all in favour ofthese people being peaceful traders but i dont want to leaveanything to chance and there is nothing like being prepared forwhatever may happen</s> presently dick got up and sauntered across to ibrahim who was engagedin cooking</s> ibrahim he said dont look round while i speak to you but go onwith your cooking</s>  i dont like the look of the leader of this party</s> he may be a respectable trader he may be a dacoit or a thug</s>  i wantyou to keep a sharp lookout without seeming to do so</s>  see that yourpistols will come out of your girdle easily</s>  keep your sword handy foruse</s>  if you see anything suspicious come over and tell me and ifthere is not time for that shout</s> i will watch sahib ibrahim said</s>  but they seem to me peaceablemen like ourselves</s>  of course they carry weapons</s>  no one would travelabout with merchandise without doing so</s> they may be all right ibrahim but i have a sort of feeling thatthey are not and at any rate it is best to be cautious</s> the other party did not light a fire but sat down and ate someprovisions they carried with them</s>  when surajah and dick had finishedtheir meal the leader again strolled over to them</s>  he asked whetherthey intended to sleep and on hearing that they did not he again satdown with them</s>  he proceeded to discuss trading matters to describethe goods he carried the places where he had purchased them and theprices he had given</s> as he talked dick noticed that three or four of the others cameacross</s>  they did not sit down but stood round listening to theconversation and sometimes joining in</s>  dicks feeling of uneasinessincreased and thrusting one hand carelessly into his girdle hegrasped the butt of one of his hidden pistols</s> suddenly a loud cry came from ibrahim</s>  at the same moment somethingpassed before dicks face</s>  he threw himself backwards drawing hispistol as he did so and fired into the body of the man behind him</s>  asecond later he shot another who was in the act of throwing a twistedhandkerchief round surajahs neck</s>  then he leapt to his feetdelivering as he did so a heavy blow with the barrel of his pistolon the head of the trader who had been sitting between him andsurajah</s> it had all passed in a few seconds and the other men started back intheir surprise at this unexpected failure of their plan</s> surajah was on his feet almost as quickly as dick</s>  even yet he didnot understand what had happened</s>  at this moment there was the crackof another pistol and then ibrahim came running towards them havingshot a man who had suddenly drawn his sword and tried to cut himdown</s>  at his heels came the six men who had up to this point beenstanding in a group near their horses</s> without hesitation dick drew out one of his singlebarrelled pistolsand shot the pretended trader whose turban had saved him from theeffect of the blow and who shouting loudly to his companions wasstruggling to his feet</s>  the remaining eight men had all drawn theirswords and were rushing upon them</s> fire surajah</s>  dick shouted</s>  are you asleep man</s> surajah was not asleep but he was confused by the suddenness of thefray and was still doubtful whether dick had not made an entirelyunprovoked attack upon the strangers</s>  however he perceived that itwas now too late to discuss that point and was a question of fightingfor his life</s>  accordingly he fired both barrels of one of hispistols</s>  one of the men dropped</s> your sword surajah</s>  dick exclaimed as he grasped the scabbard ofhis own weapon in his left hand while in his right he held his otherdoublebarrelled pistol</s> their antagonists with yells of fury were now upon them</s>  dick shotone but the next man he aimed at darted suddenly aside when he fired</s> dick dropped his pistol and grasped the hilt of his sword just intime to ward off a blow aimed at his head</s>  blow after blow wasshowered upon him so quickly that he could do no more than ward themoff and wait his opportunity</s>  he heard surajah fire two more shots inquick succession then ibrahim suddenly dashed forward and cut downhis opponent and then furiously engaged another who was on the pointof attacking him from behind</s>  dick drew his remaining pistol and shotthe man through the head</s> he had then time to look round</s> both surajahs shots had told and he was now defending himselfagainst the assaults of two others who were pressing him hard whilea third stood irresolute a short distance away</s>  dick rushed tosurajahs assistance</s>  as he did so the third man fled</s> after him ibrahim</s>  dick shouted</s>  not one of them must get away</s> the two thugs defended themselves with cries of fanatical fury buttheir opponents were far better swordsmen and fighting coolly werenot long before they cut them both down</s> what on earth is it all about dick</s>  surajah asked as panting withhis exertions he looked round after cutting down his opponent</s> thugs dick said briefly</s> are you sure dick</s>  surajah asked presently</s>  it may be a terriblebusiness for us if there is any mistake</s> for answer dick pointed to the bodies of the two men he had firstshot</s>  one still grasped the roomal or twisted silk sash while a likedeadly implement lay by the side of the other</s> thank heaven</s>  surajah ejaculated</s>  i was afraid there might havebeen a mistake dick but i see that you were right and that it was aparty of thugs</s>  if it had not been that you were on the watch forthem and had your pistol ready we should have lost our lives</s> it was a close shave as it was surajah</s>  one second later and youand i should both have been strangled</s>  i had my hand on my pistol andfelt so sure that an attack was intended that the moment somethingpassed before my face although i had no idea what it was i threwmyself back and fired at the man behind me with an instinctivefeeling that my life depended on my speed</s>  but it was only when onlooking at you i saw a man in the act of throwing a noose round yourneck that i knew exactly what i had escaped</s> it was fortunate that they had not pistols surajah said</s>  we shouldhave had no chance against them if they had had firearms</s> no they could have shot us the moment i first fired</s>  but uncle saidwhen he was talking to me one day that he had heard that thestranglers did not carry firearms because the reports might attractattention and that it was a matter of religion with them to killtheir victims by strangling but that if the strangler failed whichhe very seldom did the other men would then despatch the victims withtheir swords and knives</s> ah</s>  here comes ibrahim</s> i caught him just outside the trees sahib</s>  he will strangle no moretravellers</s> well what had we better do</s>  asked surajah</s> i should say we had better make off as fast as we can</s>  of course ifwe were really traders able to prove who we are we should go back tothe town and report the affair but as we cant do that we had betterbe moving on at once before any other party of travellers comes up</s> that was why when we had killed several of them i was anxious thatnone should get away for they might have gone and accused us ofslaughtering their companions</s> that would be too unlikely a story to be believed</s>  no one wouldcredit that three men would attack twelve</s> but there would be no one to prove that there were only three</s>  thefellows would naturally swear that there were a score of us and thatafter murdering their companions the rest made off with the booty</s> ibrahim load the pack animals at once</s>  we will saddle the horses</s> i think surajah we had better leave everything just as it is</s>  it isnow getting on for the afternoon</s>  it is likely enough that no othertravellers will enter the grove today</s>  by tomorrow at the latestsomeone will come in and will of course go and report at once inbangalore what he has found and they will send out here to examineinto it</s>  when they find that the men have all fallen sword in handthat two of them are evidently stranglers and that their girdles havenot been searched nor the packs on their horses opened it will beseen that it was not the work of robbers</s>  i dont suppose they willknow what to make of it but i should think they would most likelyconclude that these men have been attacked by some other party andthat it is a matter of some feud or private revengethough eventhen the fact that the bodies have not been searched for valuablesor the baggage or animals carried off will beat them altogether</s> by this time the horses were ready for the start and after lookingup and down the long straight road to see that no one was in sightthey issued from the wood and continued their journey</s>  being anxiousnow to get away as far as possible from the scene of the struggleinstead of going on to magree as they had intended they turned off bythe first country road on the lefthand side and made for savandroogwhich they could see towering up above the plain</s>  when within threemiles of it they halted in a large wood</s>  here as soon as the horseshad been unsaddled and the fire lighted their talk naturally turnedto the fight they had gone through</s> i cannot make out how you came to suspect them dick</s> i can hardly account for it myself but as i told you i did notlike the look of that man and i had an uneasy sort of feeling whichi could not explain even to myself that there was danger in the air</s> but what made you think of these stranglers</s>  i had heard some talkabout them but never anything for certain</s> the rajah told me when he was warning me against joining parties oftravellers that although very little was known about theorganisation it was certain that there was a sect who strangled androbbed travellers in great numbers</s>  he said that he was aware thatcomplaints had been made to princes all over india of numbers ofpersons being missing and that it was certain that these murders werenot the work of ordinary dacoits but of some secret association andthat even powerful princes were afraid to take any steps against itas one or two who had made efforts to investigate the affair hadbeen found strangled in their beds</s>  therefore no one cared to takeany steps to search into the matter</s>  it was not known whether thesestranglers scattered as they were very widely obeyed one commonchief or whether they acted separately but all were glad to leavethis mysterious organisation alone especially as they preyed only ontravellers and in no case meddled in any way with rajahs orofficials who did not interfere with them</s>  consequently the ideaoccurred to me directly that these men who seemed like traders mightbe a party of these stranglers and when the others came up while theleader was sitting talking to us i felt as if cold water was runningdown my back and that someone was whispering to me be on yourguard be on your guard</s>  therefore the moment something passedbefore my face i threw myself back and fired at the man behind mewithout a moments thought as to what it was</s> well certainly you saved our lives by doing so dick for i supposeif that man behind me had once got his silk scarf round my neck hewould have choked me before i had time to so much as lift my hand</s> i have not the least doubt that he would and i feel thankfulindeed that i had such a strange feeling that these men weredangerous</s>  do you know surajah it seems to me that it was just thesame sort of feeling that my mother tells me she has whenever myfather is in danger and i shall be curious to know when we get backwhether she had the same feeling about me</s>  anyhow i shall in futurehave even more faith than i had before in her confidence that shewould have certainly known if any evil had happened to my father</s> chapter 19 found at last</s> the next morning early dick and surajah set to work to perfect theirdisguises</s>  they had before appeared simply as two young traderswell to do and of a class above the ordinary peddling merchant</s>  theynow fitted on the ample beards that had been made at tripataly</s>  thesewere attached so firmly to their faces by an adhesive wax that theycould not be pulled off without the use of a good deal of force</s>  withthe same stuff small patches of hair were fastened on so as to hidethe edge of the foundation of the beard</s>  tufts of short grey hair wereattached to their eyebrows a few grey lines were carefully drawn atthe corner of the eyes and across the foreheads and when this wasdone they felt assured that no one was likely to suspect thedisguise</s> ibrahim who had assisted in the operation declared that he shouldtake them for men of sixtyfive and as before beginning it both ofthem had darkened their faces several shades they felt confident thatno one at the fort was likely to recognise them</s>  when surajah had puton the padded undergarment and converted himself into aportlylooking old man and dick the great horn spectacles theyindulged in a burst of laughter at their changed appearance whileibrahim fairly shouted with amusement</s> he was to stay behind in the wood when they went on for it would buthave added to the risk had he accompanied them as unless alsocompletely disguised he would have been recognised by the soldierswith whom he had talked during his twentyfour hours stay inside thetower walls</s>  he was in the evening to proceed along the road toencamp in the last grove he came to at a distance of a quarter of amile from the gates and to remain there until they returned</s> under his garments dick had wound a thin but very strong silken cordthat he had purchased at bangalore</s>  it was four hundred feet inlength and considerably increased his apparent bulk although he wasstill far from emulating the stoutness of surajah</s>  the halters of thepack horses were attached to the cruppers of the riding ponies andafter a final instruction to ibrahim that if at the end of four daysthey had not returned he was to endeavour to find out what hadhappened to them and was then to carry the news to tripataly theystarted for the fort</s>  when they approached the gate they were asbefore hailed by the sentry</s> we are merchants surajah said and we have with us a richassortment of goods of all descriptionssilks and trinkets for theladies of the governors harem and handkerchiefs scarves silverornaments and things of all kinds suitable for the wives of those oflower rank</s>  we pray for permission to enter and exhibit our wareswhich have been collected by us in the cities where they weremanufactured and which we can therefore sell at prices hithertounheard of</s> i will send word up to the governor the officer said</s>  it is a longtime since we have been visited by traders and maybe he will grantyou permission</s>  you had best go back to the shade of those trees</s>  itwill be a good hour before the answer comes</s> i think it likely they will let us in dick said as they moved awaytowards the trees</s>  it is but a short time since things weresufficiently settled for traders to venture up here and as savandrooglies altogether off the roads between large towns it is possible thatnone with such goods as we have have come this way since the garrisontook over savandroog from the british detachment that occupied it</s> in little over an hour there was a shout from the walls and onapproaching the gate again they were told that the governor had givenpermission for them to enter</s> you are to be blindfolded the officer said as the gate closedbehind them</s>  no one may ascend the rock unless he consents to this</s> your horses will be led and beware that you do not attempt to removethe bandages until you have permission to do so</s> it took nearly an hour to mount the steep road and when they came toa standstill and the subofficer who had accompanied them told themthey could now remove their bandages they found themselves in frontof a small building close to the commanders quarters</s>  the packswere by the order of the officer taken off the horses by thesoldiers who had led them up and carried into the house</s>  the horseswere fastened in the shade to rings in the wall and on surajahpointing out the packs containing goods he wished to show to theladies two of the soldiers carried them across to the governorshouse</s>  the old officer himself came to the door</s> enter my friends he said</s>  you are the first traders who have comeup here since we took over the fort some six months ago and methinksyou will do a brisk business if your wares are as you sent up to saygood and cheap</s> the bales were taken into a room the soldiers retired and in aminute the commanders wife accompanied by three or four otherladies entered</s>  dick and surajah after salaaming profoundly to theveiled figures at once began to unpack their bales</s> the assortment had been very judiciously made and to women who hadfor more than six months been deprived of the pleasure of shoppingthe display was irresistible</s>  in their desire to examine the goodsthe ladies speedily lifted their veils and seating themselves oncushions they had brought in with them chattered unrestrainedlyexamining the quality of the silks which surajah and dick squattingbehind their wares handed for their inspection comparing thecolours asking each others advice and endeavouring to beat down theterms surajah named</s> in the first place he asked the prices marked on small labelsattached to each article but suffered himself after the properamount of reluctance and protests that he should be a ruined man toabate his terms considerably although the ladies were evidently wellsatisfied that the goods were indeed bargains</s> it was a long time before the ladies could make up their minds whichto choose among the many silks exhibited for their selections</s>  whenthis had been settled the pack containing delicate muslins wasopened and the same scene gone through</s>  it was altogether fourhours before the purchases were all made and even then the boxes oftrinkets remained unopened the governors wife sayingno we will not look at them</s>  we have ruined ourselves already</s> tomorrow when our husbands know how much we have spent you can showthe trinkets to them and try your best to get them to buy</s>  thesethings we have been getting are our own affair</s>  it is for them to makeus presents of ornaments if they are disposed to</s> this evening you must come in again</s>  the ladies from the other fortwill be here then</s> the purchases made were paid for the bales again fastened up andcarried across to their room</s>  the governor met them as they went out</s> i suppose you have been ruining us all</s>  he said good humouredly</s> well it is a dull life up here and the ladies have but few chancesof spending money</s> we are to see the ladies from the other fort this evening my lordsurajah said</s>  have we your permission in the meantime to go andsell in the soldiers quarters</s>  we have goods suited to the needs oftheir wives also as well as those for the ladies</s> certainly</s>  you can go about as you please up here</s>  it is only as tothe approaches that we have to be careful</s>  but wait in your room for ashort time</s>  i will have food sent over to you</s> in a few minutes a servant brought across a large dish of pillau andseveral cakes of sweetmeats the latter being as he informed themthe special gift of the governors wife</s>  there was no occasion forthem to start as they had intended after their meal for the news oftheir coming had spread and by the time they had finished a numberof women were waiting outside</s>  until sunset they were busily engagedin selling their goodsfor the most part bright cotton cloths redsilk handkerchiefs and cheap silver trinkets</s>  soldiers sauntered inand out</s>  for these they had provided a store of pipes tobaccotobacco boxes knives and muslins for turbans and as the news spreadthat these were to be obtained the number of soldiers increaseduntil the room was quite crowded with them as well as by many nativesengaged in the work of rebuilding the fortifications</s> surajah did the selling while dicks part of the work was receivingthe money and giving change</s>  as he was stooping over a tray in frontof him piled with copper picking up the change for silver coin heheard a man ask surajah for a pound of his best tobacco and a pipe</s> there was something in the accent that caused him to look up sharply</s> as he did so he started</s>  the blood rushed to his head so violentlythat a mist seemed to pass across his eyes and his hand shook so thathe dropped the coins he was counting</s>  forgetful of the dark stain onhis face he bent forward over the tray again to conceal his emotionforced himself to pick out the right change and then handing it toits owner again looked up</s> the man who was standing before surajah was broader and taller thanthose around him</s>  the sun had darkened his face until its shadeapproached those of his companions and yet there was no mistaking thefact that he was a european</s>  a heavy moustache and beard streakedwith grey concealed the lower part of his face</s>  dick dared not gazeon the man too earnestly and could see no likeness to the picture onthe wall at shadwell but allowing for the effects of hardship andsuffering he judged him to be about the age of his father</s> the man was evidently on good terms with the soldiers one or two ofwhom were chaffing him on his purchase</s> will nothing but the best tobacco satisfy you</s>  one laughed</s> nothing and even that wont really satisfy me</s>  this stuff is goodenough when rolled up for cigars and it does well enough inhookahs but i would give all this pound for a couple of pipes ofpigtail which is the tobacco we smoked at sea</s> again dicks heart beat rapidly</s>  this man must have been a sailor</s>  hecould not restrain himself from speaking</s> have you been a sailor then</s>  he asked</s> ay i was a sailor though it is many years ago now since i saw thesea</s> we got some english tobacco at madras dick said not hesitating foronce at telling an untruth</s>  we sold most of it to the feringheesoldiers on our way up but i think i have got a little of it stillleft somewhere in the pack</s>  i am too busy to look for it now and weshall soon be going to show our goods to the officers wives but ifyou can come here at nine oclock i may have looked it out for you</s> i cant come at nine the man said for at halfpast eight i amshut up for the night</s> come at eight then dick said</s>  if i am not back come the firstthing in the morning before we get busy</s> i will come sure enough the man said</s>  i would walk a hundredmiles if they would let me for half a pound of pigtail</s> get rid of them surajah dick whispered as the man shouldered hisway through the crowd</s>  make some excuse to send them off</s> now my friends surajah said you see it is getting dusk</s>  it willsoon be too dark to see what you are buying and we have been sellingfor eight hours and need rest</s>  at eight oclock tomorrow we will openour packs again and everyone shall be served but i pray you excuseus going on any longer now</s>  as you see we are not as young as we oncewere and are both sorely weary</s> as time was no object and the work of purchasing would relieve thetedium of the following day the crowd good humouredly dispersed</s> surajah rose and closed the door after the last of them and thenturned to dick</s>  he had himself been too busily engaged in satisfyingthe demands of the customers to look up and had not noticed that oneof them was a white man</s> what is it</s>  he asked as he looked round</s>  has the heat upset you</s> then as his eye fell on dick his voice changed and he hurriedtowards him exclaiming anxiouslywhat is it dick</s>  what has happened</s> for dick was leaning against a bale by the side of him and had hiddenhis face in his arms</s>  surajah saw that his whole frame was shakingwith emotion</s> my dear lord surajah said as he knelt beside him and laid his armacross his shoulder you frighten me</s>  has aught gone wrong</s>  are youill</s> dick slightly shook his head and lifting one of his hands made asign to surajah that he could not at present speak</s>  a minute or twolater he raised his head</s> did you not see him surajah</s> see who dick</s> the white man you last served</s> i did not notice any white man</s> it was the one you gave a pound of the best tobacco to</s>  did you nothear me speak to him afterwards</s> no</s>  i was so busy and so fearfully hot with this padded thing itwas as much as i could do to attend to what they said to me</s>  a whiteman did you say</s>  oh dick</s> and as the idea struck him he rose to his feet in his excitement</s> do you thinkdo you really think he can be your father</s> i do think so surajah</s>  of course i did not recognise his face</s>  nineyears must have changed him greatly and he has a long beard</s>  but heis about the right age and i should say about the same figure andhe has certainly been a sailor for he said to one of the soldiersthat he would give that pound of tobacco for a couple of pipes ofpigtail which is the tobacco sailors smoke</s>  i told him that perhapsi might be able to find him some in my packs and asked him to comehere at eight oclock this evening</s>  if i was not in then he was tocome the first thing tomorrow morning but of course i shall be in ateight</s>  you must make some excuse to the ladies</s>  say that there aresome goods you wish to show them in one of the other packs and askme to go and look for it</s> oh dick only to think that after all our searching we seem tohave come on him at last</s>  it is almost too good to be true</s> great as was surajahs confidence in dick he had never quite sharedhis faith that he would find his father alive and his nonsuccesswhile with the army and since had completely extinguished any hopeshe had entertained</s>  his surprise therefore equalled his delight atfinding that after all it seemed probable that their search waslikely to be crowned with success</s> of course we will manage it he said</s>  i will put aside that narrowbenares clothofgold work for trimmings and you can be as long asyou like looking for it</s>  they will be too busy examining the otherthings to give it a thought after you have gone out</s> i can be back at halfpast eight dick said for the man told me hewas locked up at that hour</s>  if it had not been for that i should havearranged for him to come a little later</s>  but of course i shall haveopportunities for talking to him tomorrow</s> there is someone at the door</s>
surajah opened it and a soldier entered with their evening meal anda request that they would go across to the governors as soon as theyhad finished it as the ladies had already assembled there</s>  theyhurried through their food and then went across</s>  there was quite alarge gathering for not only had the wives of the officers in theother fort come over but all those who had been there in the morningwere again present several of them prepared to make furtherpurchases</s>  trade was as actively carried on as it had been before</s> when he judged it to be nearly eight oclock dick nudged surajah whosaid a minute afterwardswe have forgotten the benares clothofgold</s>  i am sure that willplease the ladies for waist bands or for trimmings</s>  it must have gotinto the other bales by mistake</s> i will go and fetch it dick said and rising left the room</s> a figure was standing at the door when he reached the house</s> i was afraid you had forgotten me the man said</s>  it is not quiteeight oclock yet but as i found that you were both out i began tobe afraid that you might be detained until after i had to go and youdont know how i long for a pipe of that tobacco</s>  the very thought ofit seems to bring old days back again</s> by this time they had entered the house and dick shut the door behindhim</s>  he had left a light burning when they went out</s>  dick was soagitated that he felt unable to speak but gazed earnestly in themans face</s> what is it old chap</s>  the latter said surprised at the closescrutiny</s>  is anything wrong with you</s> dick took off his spectacles rather to gain time than to see moreclearly for a plain glass had been substituted for the lenses</s> i want to ask you a question he said</s>  is your name holland</s> the man started</s> my name is jack holland he said sure enough though how you cometo know it beats me altogether for i am always called jack andexcept the governor i dont think there is a man here knows my othername</s> you were captain of the hooghley wrecked on the malabar coast nineyears ago dick said this time speaking in english</s> after an exclamation of startled surprise the man stared at him in anastonishment too great for words</s> are you english</s>  he said slowly at last</s>  yes i was in command ofthe hooghley</s>  who in gods name are you</s> dick took his two hands</s> father he said i am your son dick</s> the sailor gazed at him with a stupefied air</s> are you mad or am i</s>  he said hoarsely</s> neither of us father</s>  i am disguised as an old man but really i amlittle more than eighteen</s>  i have been searching for you for more thantwo years and thank god i have found you at last and burstinginto tears dick would have thrown his arms round his fathers neckbut the latter pushed him off with one hand and held him at armsdistance while his other hand plucked at his own throat as if toloosen something that was choking him</s> it cant be true he muttered to himself</s>  i am dreaming this</s>  ishall wake presently and you will be gone</s> it is quite true father</s>  mother is down at tripataly waiting for meto bring you to her</s> with a hoarse cry the sailor reeled and would have fallen had notdick caught him and allowed him to sink gradually to the ground wherehe lay half supported by one of the bales</s>  dick ran to one of thesaddlebags where he carried a flask of brandy in case of emergenciespoured some into a cup and held it to his fathers lips</s>  the sailorgasped</s> it is brandy he said suddenly</s>  i cant have dreamt that</s> then he broke into a violent sobbing</s>  dick knelt by his side and tookhis hand</s> it is assuredly no dream father he said gently</s>  i am really yourson dick</s>  i am here with a trusty friend and now we have found youyou may be sure that we will in some way manage your escape</s>  thereis no time now to tell you all that has happened</s>  that i can doafterwards</s>  all that is important for you to know is that mother isquite well</s>  she has never given up hope and has always insisted thatyou were alive for she said that she should surely have known if youhad died</s>  so she taught me her language until i could speak like anative and two years and a half ago she came out here with me</s> i accompanied the army with my uncles troop and searched everyhill fort they took for you</s>  since they went back i have been up inmysore with my friend surajah and thank god at last we have foundyou</s> thank god indeed my boy</s>  i do thank him not only that you havefound me but that your mother whom i had never hoped to see againis alive and well and also that he has given me so good a son</s> and now father about your escape</s>  in the first place have yougiven your parole not to try to get away</s> captain holland was himself now</s> no lad no</s>  at the fort where i was for six years there was nopossibility of escape and as i was a long time before i began tospeak the language even if i had got away i could never have made myway through the country</s>  then the governorit was the same we haveheretook me with him to kistnagherry</s>  i was the only white captivewho went there with him</s>  at kistnagherry there were five or sixothers but when tippoo heard that an english army was coming up theghauts an order came that they were to be killed</s>  but the governor isa kindhearted old fellow and as i had become almost a chum of hishe chose to consider that the order did not apply to me but only tothose he had found at kistnagherryfor i fancy my existence had beenforgotten altogether</s> i had great hopes that the british would take the place</s>  i think thatis the only time i have hoped since i was made prisoner but the oldman is a good soldier and beat them off</s> when peace was made kistnagherry was as you know given up and thegovernor was ordered to evacuate the place and to come here</s>  hebrought me with him making me dye my face before i started so thatin my native dress it would not be noticed in any town we passedthrough that i was a white</s>  for had this been done the news mighthave come to tippoos ears and there would have been an end of me</s> except that i am locked up at night i am not treated as a prisonerbut the governor who has a strong sense of duty has a certain watchkept over me</s>  he has a real friendship for me and would do all in hispower to save my life short of disobedience to an actual order</s>  buthis view is that i have been confided to his care and that if at anymoment the sultan should write to demand me of him he would be boundto produce me</s> well father it must be nearly halfpast eight</s>  i will go with youand see where you are confinedthat is the first step</s>  we will bothtonight think over the best way of attempting your escape and in themorning when your guard is removed if you will come straight here wewill talk it over</s> i am afraid you will have to wait for your pigtail till we get tomadras</s> captain holland laughed</s> i can afford to wait for that now</s>  god bless you my boy</s>  i havenever looked for such happiness as this again</s>  but as you say it istime for me to be off</s>  i have never been late yet and if it werereported to the governor that i was so tonight he might think thatthere was something in the wind</s> dick walked with his father across the fort</s> that is the house in the corner the captain said pointing to onebefore which a group of soldiers were standing</s>  dont come anyfarther</s> dick stood looking after him and heard a voice sayyou are late jack</s>  i was beginning to wonder what had become ofyou</s> i dont think it is past the hour yet captain holland replied</s>  ihave been with those traders</s>  they told me this afternoon they mightbe able to find me some english tobacco in their pack but they havebeen too busy to look for it</s>  i hope they will light on it tomorrow</s> if they do i will give you half a pipeful</s>  i wont give you more forit is strong enough to blow your head off after this tasteless stuffyou smoke here</s> then dick hurried off to the house snatched up the stuff he wassupposed to be looking for and joined surajah at the governors</s> it was another hour before the ladies had completed their purchases</s> dick on entering had given a little nod to surajah to let him knowthat it was really his father whom he had discovered and had thentried to keep his attention upon his work as a salesman and surajahas he handed him the goods had given a furtive squeeze to his hand intoken of his sympathy</s> so it is really your father</s>  he said as carrying their greatlydiminished pack they walked across to their house</s> it is indeed</s>  you may imagine his surprise and joy when i told himwho i was</s>  now we have got to talk over the best plan of getting himout</s> when the door was shut and they had seated themselves on two of thebales dick first repeated all that his father had told him and thenfor a long time they discussed the best plan of attempting an escape</s> both agreed at once that it would be next to impossible to get himdown the road and out of the gate</s>  in the first place they would haveto leave by daylight and even could a disguise be contrived thatwould deceive the sentries and guard at the gate all of whom werewell acquainted with captain hollands figure and appearance it wascertain that as but two had come up the rock a third would not beallowed to leave unless he had a special order from the governor</s> they agreed therefore that the escape must be made over theprecipice</s>  that this was a matter of great difficulty was evident fromthe fact that the captain had made no attempt to get away in thatmanner</s>  still there was hope that with the assistance of the silkrope dick had brought with them it might be managed</s> there was too the initial difficulty of getting out from the fort tobe faced</s> we can do nothing till we have had a long talk with my father dicksaid</s>  i have no doubt that he has thought all these things over andhas long before this made up his mind as to the point at which adescent would be easiest</s>  as at present we know little except by thecasual examination we made last time we can decide on nothing byourselves</s> i hope it wont be a long way to let oneself down surajah saidfor i am quite sure i could not hold on by that thin rope for anydistance</s> nor could i surajah if i had to trust only to my hands</s>  my fatheras a sailor will be able to put us up to the best way to do it</s>  butat any rate he might let you down first and i think that by twistingthe rope two or three times round my body and then holding it betweenmy knees and feet i might manage</s>  but i dare say my father will hiton some better plan than that</s> and now we will lie down</s>  i am so stiff that i can hardly stand fromsquatting for so many hours behind those things of ours</s>  i thoughtthat i had got pretty well accustomed to it but i never calculated onhaving to do it from ten in the morning until ten at night with onlytwo halfhours off</s> dick however had little sleep that night</s>  he was too excited overthe glorious success he had obtained to be capable of closing an eyeand it was not until day was breaking that he fell into a doze</s> an hour later he started to his feet at a knock at the door</s>  he waswide awake in a moment and on running to it his father entered</s> you look older today than you did yesterday the latter said as heheld his hand and gazed into dicks face</s>  i fancy that neither of ushas had any sleep to speak of</s>  as for myself i have not closed aneye</s> nor did i father until day began to break</s>  now please let us talkover our plan of escape first for we may be interrupted at anymoment</s> right you are lad</s>  does your friend here speak english</s>  for i havenever got to be a good hand at their lingo</s>  i want to thank him toobut as you say time is precious and we must postpone that</s> he understands it father and can talk it pretty fairly</s>  we havebeen constantly together for nearly two years</s> now in the first place is there any place where we can get downfrom the top here with the aid of a rope</s> it would be a pretty tough job anyhow but at the farthest end ofthe rock is a place where it goes sharp down as if cut with a knife</s> that would be the best place to try</s>  i take it to be about two hundredfeet deep</s>  beyond the ground seems to slope regularly away</s>  if icould have got a rope i should have tried it but they are prettyscarce commodities up herein fact i have never seen a piece twentyfeet long since we came</s>  what sort of rope have you got</s> dick opened the front of his garment and showed the rope round hisbody</s>  captain holland gave a low whistle of dismay</s> i should not like to trust a child with that thing dick much less agrown man</s>  it is no thicker than a flag halliard</s> it is thin father but there is no fear as to its strength</s>  i testedevery yard of it and found it would bear six hundred weight</s> well that is ample but how is one to hold on to a cord like that</s> that is just what we want you to tell us father</s>  there must be someway of managing it if one could but hit upon it</s> yes that is so lad the sailor said thoughtfully</s>  i will think itover</s>  anyhow i think i could lower you both down and by knotting iti might get hold enough to come down after you but even the knotswould be precious small</s> one might get over that father by fastening a short stick acrossevery five or six feet or every two or three feet if you like</s> good dick</s>  that would prevent ones coming down with a runcertainly and by keeping it between ones legs one could always geta rest</s>  yes that will do lad if i can think of nothing better</s> there are a lot of spears stowed away in the room adjoining mine</s>  ifwe were to cut them up into sixinch lengths with one of a foot longto each ten for sitting on they would be just the thing</s> that is capital father</s>  i had a lot of practice in rope climbingbefore i came out and i am sure that i could manage with the helpthat would give</s>  i dont think surajah could but we could let himdown first easily</s>  now as to your prison</s> there are bars to the windows the captain said and a sentry isalways on duty outside</s>  the only way would be to escape at the rear</s>  ihave often thought it over but it was of no use breaking out thereif i could not get any farther</s>  the wall is built of loose stonewithout mortar</s>  you see it would have been a big job to bring upeither mortar or bricks from down below so most of the buildings areentirely of stone</s>  the wall is two feet thick but there would be nogreat difficulty in getting out the stones and making a hole bigenough to crawl through</s>  i could not do it in my room because theyalways look round to see that everything is safe before they lock meup and it would take so long to do it noiselessly that half the nightwould be wasted before i could get out</s>  but the magazine where thespears are kept communicates with my room and i could slip in therein the daytime when no one was looking get behind the spears whichare piled against the wall and work hidden by them</s>  no one would belikely to go into my room during the day and if he did he would notexpect to find me there as i am generally about the place</s>  in thatway i could get out enough stones to render it an easy job to finishit after i was locked up</s>  a spear head is as good a thing to help meprize them out as one could wish for</s> very well father</s>  then we had better settle that you shall get outin that way</s>  now shall we go round on the outside and help you</s> no i dont say but that your help would make it easier to get thestones out without making a noise</s>  still your going round might benoticed</s> well then father shall we seize and gag the sentry</s>  we have donesuch a thing before successfully</s> no that wouldnt do dick</s>  the guard house is hard by and theslightest noise would destroy us all</s>  besides as they have not manysentries posted up here they relieve guard every hour so that thething would be discovered in no time</s> no when i get out i will creep along noiselessly by the wall</s>  thereare houses in the yard almost all along and though the sentry wouldnot be likely to see me in the shade of the wall i will take care tocross the open spaces when his back is turned</s>  i will then comestraight here for you and we will make for the wall behind thegovernors house</s>  there is no sentry on that side for that steepravine covers it from attack there</s>  however there are six or eightfeet of level ground between the foot of the wall and the edge of theravine</s>  the walls are twenty feet in height</s>  with fifty feet of thatrope i will make a ladder and will get hold of a piece of iron tomake a grapnel of</s>  how much time can you give me</s> i should think we could stay here today and tomorrow without seemingto be dawdling without reason</s>  do you think you could get ready bytomorrow night father</s> yes that will give me plenty of time</s>  let me see</s>  there is the shortladder to make</s>  that wont take me over an hour</s>  there are a hundredbits to cut for the long ladder putting them about two feet apart</s> that will be a longish job for the spear shafts are of very toughwood</s>  however i have a saw and some oil which will prevent itmaking a noise and can make fairly quick work of it</s>  i have severaltools too</s>  i very often do carpentering jobs of all sortsthat iswhat first made the governor take to me</s>  i can get all that part ofthe work done today</s>  tonight i will do the knotting</s>  of course ishall make it a goodish bit over two hundred feet long for it mayturn out that i have not judged the depth right and that the cliff ishigher than i thought it was</s> i dont think sawing up the spear shafts will take more than an houror two so i shall be able to show myself about the place as usual</s>  iwill go over and take a good look at the rock again and stick a spearhead into the ground at the point where it seems to me that it goesdown straightest and where there is the least chance of the ropegetting rubbed against a sharp edge</s>  i shant begin at the wall untiltomorrow for i dont suppose i shall be able to get out the first fewstones without making a bit of a noise and it would not do to work atnight</s> now lad i think we can consider that as all settled and i wontcome near you again unless there is some change of plan</s>  i shall behere tomorrow evening i hope it will be by ten oclockthat mustdepend upon how long it takes me to get down the outside layer ofstone</s> if you should hear a sudden row make at once for the wall behind thegovernors house and wait there for me to join you</s>  you see some ofthe stones may come down with a run and if they do i shall give therest a shove and be out like a shot</s>  i shall hear which side thesentry is running round the house and shall belt the other way</s>  ofcourse he will see the stones and give the alarm but in thedarkness i have not much doubt of being able to slip away and i willthen make my way straight to the wall</s>  of course i shall have theladders tied up into bundles and shall take care not to leave thembehind me</s> all right father</s>  we will be ready tomorrow evening</s>  we shall waitquietly for you until you come unless we hear a sudden alarm</s>  if wedo we will go round behind the governors house and wait there foryour coming</s> that is it my lad</s>  now i will be going</s>  i am glad that no one hascome in while i have been here</s> chapter 20 the escape</s> soon after eight oclock customers began to drop in and throughoutthe day a brisk trade was carried on</s>  surajah was sent for in thecourse of the morning by the governor who bought several silverbracelets brooches and earrings for his wife</s>  most of the otherofficers came in during the day and made similar purchases and manytrinkets were also sold to the soldiers who considered them a goodinvestment for their money</s>  indeed no small portion of the earningsof the natives of india are spent upon silver ornaments for theirwomen as they can at any time be converted into cash</s> the commoner cloths knives beads and trinkets were almost alldisposed of by the end of the day for as no traders had come up forsix months and as a long time might elapse before others did so thegarrison were glad to lay in a store of useful articles for themselvesand families especially as the prices of all the goods were at leastas low as they could have been bought in a town</s> we shant leave much behind us dick said as he looked round afterthe last customer had left and they had sat down to their eveningmeal</s>  almost all the silver work and the better class of goods havegone and i should say threequarters of the rest</s>  i daresay we shallget rid of the remainder tomorrow</s>  i dont suppose many of thesoldiers stationed down by the gate have come up yet but when theyhear that we sell cheaply some of them will be here tomorrow</s>  we havemade no money by the transaction but at any rate we shall have gotback the outlay</s>  of course i should not have cared if we had gotnothing back</s>  still it is satisfactory to have cleared oneself</s> i wonder how ibrahim is getting on down in the wood</s> he wont be expecting us today surajah replied but i have nodoubt he will begin to feel anxious by tomorrow night</s>  i wish we couldhave seen some way of getting the horses down</s>  it will be awkwarddoing without them</s> yes</s>  i hope we shall get a good start</s>  of course we must put on ourpeasants dresses again</s>  i am glad enough to be rid of that ropethough i have had to put on two or three additional things to fill meout to the same size as before</s>  still i dont feel so bound in as idid though it is horribly hot</s> i am sure i shall be glad to get rid of all this stuffing surajahsaid</s>  i felt ready to faint today when the room was full</s> well we have only one more day of it dick said</s>  i do hope fatherwill be able to get out by ten oclock</s>  then before eleven we shallbe at the edge of the rock</s>  say we are two hours in getting down andwalking round to join ibrahim</s>  that will take us till one and weshall have a good five hours before fathers escape will bediscovered</s>  they will know that he cant have gone down the road andit will take them fully two hours to search the fort and all over therock</s>  it will be eight oclock before they set out in pursuit and bythat time we ought to be well on the road between cenopatam andanicull</s> if we can manage to buy horses at cenopatam of course we will do so</s> we shall be there by five oclock and ought to be able to get them ina couple of hours</s>  once on horseback we are safe</s>  i dont think theywill pursue very farperhaps not even so far as cenopatam for thegovernor will see that he had better not make any fuss about a whitecaptive having escaped when it was not known that he had one there atall</s>  i think it more likely that when he finds father has got fairlyaway he will take no steps at all</s>  they have no cavalry here and hewill know well enough that there will be no chance of our beingtracked and overtaken by footmen if we had but a couple of hoursstart</s> i think that is so dick</s>  he has done his duty in keeping your fathera prisoner but i dont think he will be at heart at all sorry thathe has made his escape</s> i think surajah i will write a letter to him and leave it here tobe found after we have got away thanking him in fathers name for thekindness that he has always shown him saying who i am why i camehere and asking his pardon for the deception that i have been obligedto play upon him</s>  he is a good old fellow and i should think it wouldplease him</s> i should think it would surajah agreed</s> i will do up my brace of pistols in a packet and put them with thenote dick went on and will say in it that i hope he will acceptthem as a token of our esteem and gratitude</s>  they are wellfinishedenglish pistols and i have no doubt he will prize them</s>  i willmention too that we shall have made our escape at eleven oclockand therefore by the time he receives my letter we shall be farbeyond the reach of pursuit</s>  i daresay that will decide him uponletting the matter pass quietly and he will see himself that bymaking no fuss over it no one outside the fortress will ever knowthat a prisoner has escaped</s> the next day passed comparatively quietly</s>  a good many soldiers andwomen came up from below and before sunset their goods werecompletely cleared out</s>  the governor came over in the afternoon andhad a talk with them</s>  they expressed their satisfaction at the resultof their trading and said that they should be off before sunrise</s> i hope you will come again he said but not for another sixmonths for assuredly you will take away with you pretty nearly everyrupee in the fortress</s>  my wife and the other ladies are all wellcontent with their purchases and agree that they would not have gotthem cheaper at seringapatam or bangalore</s> we try to buy cheaply and sell cheaply surajah said modestly</s>  inthat way we turn over our money quickly</s>  but it is seldom indeedthat we find so good a market as we have done here</s>  when we leftbangalore we thought that it might be a month before we should haveto go back there to replenish our packs from our magazine but weshall only have been away five or six days</s> i am glad that you are content for you are honest traders and notlike some of the rascals that have come up to the forts i havecommanded and fleeced the soldiers right and left</s> although not given to blushing dick felt that he coloured under hisdye at the praise for although they had certainly sold cheaply hedoubted whether the term honest could be fairly applied to the wholetransaction</s> as ten oclock approached the two friends sat with open doorlistening intently for every sound</s>  conversation was still going on inthe houses and occasionally they could make out a dark figurecrossing the yard</s> it was not yet ten when a light footfall was heard and a moment latercaptain holland appeared at the door</s> it is all right so far he said but wait five minutes to give metime to get the ladder fixed</s>  you had better come one by one andstroll quietly across the yard</s>  it is too dark for anyone to recogniseyou unless they run right against you and even if they do so theywill not think it strange you should be out after having been coopedup all the day</s> in another moment he was gone</s>  they had each during the day gone outfor a time and had walked round through the narrow lane behind thegovernors house to see that there were no obstructions that theymight fall over in the dark</s>  they agreed on comparing notes thatcaptain holland had chosen the best possible place for scaling thewall for the lane was evidently quite unused and the house whichwas higher than the wall would completely screen them fromobservation</s> in five minutes dick followed his father leaving surajah to come onin a minute or two</s>  they had secured about them the gold and silverthey had received for their purchases but they left behind a largeheap of copper coins on the top of which dick had placed his letterto the governor and the parcel containing the brace of pistols</s>  hemet no one on his way to the rendezvous but almost ran against hisfather in the dark</s> steady dick or you will run me down captain holland said</s>  i havegot the ladder fixed so you had better go up at once</s>  take thesethree spears with you</s>  i will bring the long ladder</s> we shant want the spears father</s>  we have a brace ofdoublebarrelled pistols and two brace of single barrels</s> never mind that dick</s>  you will see that they will come in useful</s> dick took the spears and mounted the ladder without further question</s> his father then came up and placed the long rope which with thepieces of wood was a bulky bundle on the wall and then descendedagain</s>  it was another five minutes before surajah came up</s> i was stopped on the way he said and had to talk with one of theofficers</s> he and the captain were soon by dicks side</s>  the ladder was thenpulled up and lowered on the other side of the wall</s>  they were soonstanding at its foot</s> shall i jerk the ladder down father</s> i think not dick</s>  it would only make a clatter and it is no matterto us whether they find it in the morning or not</s>  you had betterfollow me</s>  i know every foot of the ground and there are some nastyplaces i can tell you</s> they had to make several detours to avoid ravines running deep intothe plateau and for a time captain holland walked very cautiously</s> when he had passed these he stepped out briskly and in less than anhour from starting they were near the edge of the precipice</s>  theireyes had by this time become accustomed to the darkness</s> we are just there now captain holland said</s>  but we must go verycautiously for the rock falls sheer away without warning</s>  ah</s>  thereis the edge a few yards ahead of me</s> now do you stay where you are while i feel about for that spearhead i put in to mark the place</s>  it had about three feet of the staffon it</s>  if it were not for that there would be small chance of findingit</s>  i know it is somewhere close here</s> in a few minutes he returned to them</s> i have found it he said</s>  keep close behind me</s> after walking for fifty yards he stopped</s> here it is lads</s> now give me those spears dick</s> he thrust them firmly into the ground a few inches apart</s> throw your weight on them too he said</s>  that is right</s>  now theywill stand many times the strain we shall put on them</s> i have chosen this place dick for two reasons</s>  in the first placebecause it is the most perpendicular and in the second because thesoil and grass project slightly over the edge of the rock</s>  there is acushion in that bundle and four spear heads</s>  i will peg it down closeto the edge and the rope will run easily over it</s> now surajah we had better let you down first</s>  you will be tiedquite securely and there will be no risk whatever as you know ofthe rope giving way</s>  i should advise you to keep your eyes shut tillyou get to the bottom for the rope will certainly twist round andround but keep your arms well in front of you and whenever you feelthe rock open your eyes and send yourself off with your arms andlegs</s>  i dont think you will touch for at this point it seemed to meas i looked down that the rock projects farther out than anywhereelse on the face of the precipice and that a stone dropped straightdown would fall some fourteen or fifteen feet from its foot</s>  would youlike me to bandage your eyes</s> no thank you</s>  i will keep my eyes closed</s> that is the best thing you can do captain holland said though itis so dark that you would not be able to see if you did</s>  when you getto the bottom untie the rope pull it gently down and call out to mewhether the lowest piece of stick touches the ground</s>  if it does noti will pull it up again and fasten on some more</s>  i have got a dozenspare ones with me</s> captain holland then told surajah and dick to take off their uppergarments</s>  these he wound round and round the lower four feet of therope increasing its diameter to over two inches</s> there he said as he fastened this round surajahs body under thearms</s>  it wont hurt you now</s>  that silk rope would have cut in aninch deep before you got to the bottom if it had not been covered</s> then he took off his own garment made it up into a roll lashed oneend to the rope in the centre of surajahs back passed it between hislegs and fastened it to the knot at his chest</s> there he said that will prevent any possibility of the thingslipping up over your shoulders and will take a lot of the strain offyour chest</s> then he lay down and crawled forward to the edge pegged the cushiondown and then turning to surajah saidall is ready now</s> surajah had felt rather ashamed that all these precautions should betaken for him while the others would have to rely solely upon theirhands and feet and sternly repressing any sign of nervousness hestepped forward to the side of captain holland</s> that is right the captain said approvingly</s>  now lie down by myside and work yourself backwards</s>  go over on one side of the cushionfor you might otherwise displace it</s>  i will hold your wrists and letyou over</s>  dick will hold the rope</s>  i will put it fairly on thecushion</s>  then i shall take it and stand close to the edge and pay itout gradually as you go down</s>  if you should find any projecting pieceof rock call out stop</s>  i will hold on at once</s>  we can then talkover how we can best avoid the difficulty</s>  when you are down and itell you dick is coming take hold of one of the steps and hold theladder as firmly as you can so as to prevent it from swaying about</s> now are you ready</s> quite ready surajah said in a firm voice</s> dick who was standing five or six yards back tightened the rope</s> gradually he saw surajahs figure disappear over the edge</s> slack out a little bit his father said</s>  that is right</s>  i have gotit over the cushion</s>  now hold it firmly until i am on my feet</s>  that isright</s>  now pay it out gradually</s> it seemed an endless time to dick before his father exclaimedthe strain is off</s>  thank god he has got down all right</s> a minute later there was a slight pull on the rope and the captainpaid it out until he heard a call from below</s> have you got to the lowest stick</s>  he asked leaning over</s> yes it is just touching the ground</s> not such a bad guess the captain said as he turned to dick</s>  thereare about twenty feet left</s> he now fastened the rope round the spears in the ground</s> i will lower you down if you like dick</s>  you are half as heavy againas that young native but i have no doubt that i can manage it</s> not at all father</s>  i am not a bit nervous about it</s>  if it was lighti should not feel so sure of myself for i might turn giddy but thereis no fear of my doing so now</s> well lad it is as well to be on the safe side and i manufacturedthis yesterday</s> he put a loop composed of a rope some four feet long over dicksshoulders and under his arms</s>  to each end was attached a strong doublehook like two fingers</s> there lad</s>  now if you feel at all tired or shaky all you have gotto do is to hook this on to one of the steps</s>  do you see</s>  one hook oneach side of the cord</s>  that way you can rest as long as you like andthen go on again</s>  you say you can go down a rope with your hands only</s> i should advise you to do that if you can and not to use your legsunless you want to sit down on one of the long steps for as youknow if you use your feet the rope will go in till they are almostlevel with your head while if you use your arms only it will hangstraight down</s> i know father</s>  and i dont suppose i shall have to rest at all forthese cross sticks make it ten times as easy as having to grip therope only</s> dick laid himself down as surajah had done and crawled backwardsuntil he was lying half over the edge</s>  then he seized the rope andbegan to descend hand over hand</s>  he counted the rungs as he wentdown and half way he sat down on one of the long pieces hitched thehooks on to the one above and rested his arms</s>  after a short pausehe continued until he reached the bottom</s> the captain who was stooping with his hand on the rope felt thevibration cease and as he leaned over he heard dick call outi am all right father</s>  those bits of wood make easy work of it</s> then the captain at once began to descend and was soon standingbeside his son and surajah</s> thank god that job is finished</s>  how do you both feel</s> my arms feel as if they had done some work father</s>  i have been fouror five months without practice or i should hardly have felt it</s> and how are you surajah</s> i feel ashamed at having been let down like a baby captain hollandand at being so nervous</s> there is nothing to be ashamed of captain holland said</s>  ropeclimbing is a thing that only comes with practice and as tonervousness most landsmen are afraid to trust themselves to a rope atall</s>  did you open your eyes</s> not once sahib</s>  i kept my arms out as you told me but i did nottouch anything</s>  i could feel that i was spinning round and round andwas horribly frightened just at first</s>  but i went down so smoothly andquietly that the feeling did not last long for i knew that the ropewas very strong and as i did not touch anything it seemed to me thatthere could be no fear of it being cut against the rock</s> the clothes were soon unwound from the rope and put on again</s>  captainholland cut off all the slack of the rope and made it into a coil</s> the slope is all right as far as i could see from the top he saidbut we may come across nasty bits again and this will stand inuseful if we do</s> they went down cautiously but at a fair rate of speed until withoutmeeting with any serious difficulty they arrived on the plain</s>  fourmiles brisk walking brought them to the grove where ibrahim had beenleft and they had scarce entered among the trees when he askedwho is it that is coming</s> it is us ibrahim</s>  we have got my father</s> ibrahim gave an exclamation of joy and a minute later they joinedhim</s> you were not asleep then ibrahim</s>  dick said</s> no my lord</s>  i have slept during the day and watched at night but idid not sleep yesterday for i was growing sorely anxious and hadbegun to fear that harm had befallen you</s> well let us be off at once</s>  of course we have had to leave thehorses behind us and i want to be at cenopatam by daybreak</s>  we willbuy horses there</s> they struck across the country to the southwest until they came on aroad between magree and cenopatam and arrived within sight of thelatter town just at daybreak</s>  as they walked dick and surajah hadwith no small amount of pain removed their beards and the patches ofhair</s> you ought both to have shaved before you put those things oncaptain holland said as they muttered exclamations of pain</s>  you seecobblers wax or whatever it is sticks to what little down there ison your cheeks and chin and i dont wonder that it hurts horriblypulling it off</s>  if you had shaved first you would not have felt anyof that</s> i will remember that father if i ever have to disguise myselfagain dick said</s>  i feel as if i were pulling the whole skin off myface</s> the painful task was at last finished</s> i shall be glad to have a look at you in the morning dick hisfather said so as to see what you are really like of which i havenot the least idea at present</s>  you must feel a deal more comfortablenow that you have got rid of the rope</s> i am indeed</s>  i am sure surajah must be quite as much pleased atleaving his padding behind</s> they stopped half a mile from the town which was a place ofconsiderable size</s>  dick took from the saddlebag of the horse ibrahimwas leading the bottle of liquid with which he was in the habit ofrenewing his staining every few days and darkened his fathers faceand hands</s>  then they took off their costumes as merchants and put ontheir peasants attire</s>  dick directed ibrahim to make a detour so asto avoid the town and come down on the road half a mile beyond it andthere wait until they rejoined themfor his father was to accompanyibrahim</s> it was growing light as dick and surajah entered the town and in halfan hour the streets became alive with people</s>  after some search theyfound a man who had several horses to sell and after the properamount of bargaining they purchased three fairly good animals</s> another half hour was occupied in procuring saddles and bridles andafter riding through quiet streets to avoid questioning they left thetown and soon rejoined their companions</s> now surajah dick said we will be colonels again for a bit</s> the saddlebags were again opened and in a few minutes they weretransformed</s> why where on earth did you get those uniforms</s>  captain hollandasked in surprise</s>  those sashes are the signs that their wearers areofficers of the palace for i have seen them more than once atkistnagherry and the badges are those of colonels</s>  there is nothinglike impudence dick but it seems to me it would have been safer ifyou had been contented with subofficers uniforms</s> dick laughed</s> we are wearing them because we have a right to them dick laughed</s> we are both colonels in tippoos army and officers of thepalacethat is we were so until a month ago though i expect sincethen our names have been struck off their army list</s>  i will tell youabout it as we ride</s> you had better tell me afterwards dick</s>  i have never ridden a horsein my life except when they were taking me from the coast to mysoreand i shall have enough to do to keep my seat and attend to mysteering without trying to listen to you</s> they rode all day passed through anicull and oussoor and halted forthe night in a grove two or three miles farther on</s>  they had not beenquestioned as at a walk they went through the town</s>  captain hollandhad ridden behind with ibrahim and the latter had stopped and laid ina stock of provisions at anicull</s> thank goodness that is over</s>  captain holland said as theydismounted</s>  i feel as if i had been beaten all over with sticks andam as hungry as a hunter</s> ibrahim will have some food ready in half an hour father and ishall be glad of some myself</s>  though you know we all had somechupatties he bought</s> they were better than nothing dick but a pancake or two does not govery far with men who have been travelling since ten oclock lastnight</s>  well lad i am glad that you have got rid of your beard andthat except for that brown skin i am able to have a look at you asyou are</s>  you will be bigger than i am dickbigger by a good bit ishould say and any father might be proud of you much more so one whohas been fetched out from a captivity from which he had given up allhope of escaping</s>  as it is lad words cant tell how grateful i feelto god for giving me such a son</s> my dear father it is mothers doing</s>  it has been her plan eversince she heard that you were wrecked that we should come out here tofind you and she has had me regularly trained for it</s>  i had mastersfor fencing and gymnastics we always talked hindustani when we weretogether and she has encouraged me to fight with other boys so thati should get strong and quick</s> that evening by the fire dick told his father the whole story of hislife since he had been in india</s> well my lad you have done wonders his father said when he hadfinished and if i had as much enterprise and go as you have ishould have been out of this place years ago</s>  but in the first placei was very slow in picking up their lingo</s>  you see until within thelast three or four years there have always been other englishmen withme</s>  of course we talked together and as most of them were able tospeak a little of the lingo there was no occasion for me to learn it</s> then i was always from the first when they saw that i was handy atall sorts of things kept at odd jobs and so got less chance ofpicking up the language than those who were employed in drilling orwho had nothing to do but talk to their guards</s>  but most of all i didnot try to escape because i found that if i did so it wouldcertainly cost my companions their lives</s>  that was the way thatscoundrel tippoo kept us from making attempts to get off</s> well soon after the last of the other captives was murdered wemoved away to kistnagherry which was a very difficult place to escapefrom and besides very soon after we got there i heard of the warwith our people and hoped that they would take the place</s>  it was asyou may suppose a terrible disappointment to me when they failed intheir attack on it</s>  still i hoped that they would finally thrashtippoo and that somehow i might get handed over to them</s>  howeveras you know when peace was made and kistnagherry had to be givenover the governor got orders to evacuate it without waiting for theenglish to come up to take possession</s> well since i have been at savandroog i have thought often of tryingto get away</s>  by the time i got there i had learned to speak thelanguage fairly enough to make my way across the country and i havebeen living in hopes that somehow or other i might get possession ofa rope long enough to let myself down the rocks</s>  but as i told you ihave never so much as seen one up there twenty feet long</s> i did think of gradually buying enough cotton cloth to twist up andmake a rope of but you see when one has been years in captivity oneloses a lot of ones energy</s>  if i had been worse off i should haveset about the thing in earnest but you see i was not badly treatedat all</s>  i was always doing odd carpentering jobs for the colonel andofficers and armourers work at the guns</s>  any odd time i had over idid jobs for the soldiers and their wives</s>  i got a good many littlepresents enough to keep me in decent clothes and decent foodif youcan call the food you have up there decentand to provide me withtobacco so that except that i was a prisoner and for the thought ofmy wife and you i had really nothing to grumble about and was indeedbetter off than anyone in the fortress except the officers</s>  so yousee i just existed always making up my mind that some day i shouldsee a good chance of making my escape but not really making anypreparations towards casting off my moorings</s> now dick it must be past twelve oclock and i am dog tired</s>  howfar have we to ride tomorrow</s> it is thirtyfive miles from oussoor to kistnagherry which will befar enough for us to go tomorrow and then another fiveandtwentywill take us down to tripataly</s>  as the horses have gone about fortymiles it would be a long journey for them to go right throughtomorrow</s> i dont think i could do it dick if they could</s>  i expect i shall bestiffer tomorrow than i am now</s>  eager as i am to see your dear motheri dont want to have to be lifted off my horse when i arrive therealmost speechless with fatigue</s> the next day they rode on to kistnagherry passing a small frontierfort without question</s>  they slept at the post house there dick andsurajah having removed their scarves and emblems of rank as soon asthey passed the frontier in order to escape all inquiries</s>  theystarted next morning at daybreak and arrived within sight oftripataly at ten oclock</s> now father i will gallop on dick said</s>  i must break the news tomother before you arrive</s> certainly dick his father who had scarcely spoken since theystarted replied</s>  i have been feeling very anxious about it all themorning for though as you tell me she has never lost faith in mybeing alive my return cannot but be a great shock to her</s> dick rode on and on arriving at the palace was met in the courtyardby the rajah who was on the point of going out on horseback</s>  hedismounted at once</s> i am truly glad to see you back dick for your mother has been in asad state of anxiety about you</s>  eight days ago she started up from anap she was taking in the middle of the day and burst out cryingsaying that she was certain you were in some terrible danger thoughwhether you were killed or not she could not say</s>  since then she hasbeen in a bad state</s>  she has scarcely closed an eye and has spent herwhole time in walking restlessly up and down</s> it is quite true that i was in great danger uncle and i am sorryindeed that she is in this state for my coming home will be a shockto her and she has an even greater one to bear</s>  surajah and i haverescued my father and he will be here in a few minutes</s> i congratulate you the rajah said warmly</s>  that is newsindeednews that i for one never expected to hear</s>  it is simplymarvellous dick</s>  however i am sure that your mother is not fit tobear it at present</s>  i will go up now and tell gholla to break yourreturn gradually to her</s>  i will say nothing about your father to youraunt</s>  as soon as the news that you are here is broken you must go toyour mother</s>  tell her as little as possible</s>  pretend that you arehungry and have a meal sent up and persuade her to take somenourishment then declare positively that you wont tell heranything about your adventures until she has had a long sleep</s>  ghollawill prepare a sleeping draught for her</s> in the meantime i will ride off directly i have seen my wife tomeet surajah and your father and bring him on here</s>  i shant tellanyone who he is in case a chance word should come to your mothersears</s>  if she wakes up again this evening and asks for you you mustjudge for yourself whether to tell her anything or to wait untilmorning</s>  you might perhaps if she seems calm gladden her with thenews that from what you have heard you have very strong hopes that aprisoner in keeping at one of the hill forts is your father</s>  thentomorrow morning you can tell her the whole truth</s>  now i will run upto gholla</s>  there is no time to be lost</s> i shall be in the dining room uncle when i am wanted</s> a few minutes later gholla came in hastily</s> your mother has fainted dick</s>  i broke the news to her very gentlybut it was too much for her in her weak state</s>  when she comes roundagain and is able to talk i will fetch you</s>  in the meantime i willsend annie in to you</s> two minutes later the girl ran in with a flushed face threw herselfinto dicks arms and kissed him</s> i cant help it dick she said so it is of no use your scoldingme</s>  this is a surprise</s>  who would have thought of your coming back sosoon</s>  but it is lucky you did</s>  your mother has been in a sad way andshe was so sure that you had been in some terrible danger that i havebeen almost as anxious as she has</s>  and now it seems that i need nothave frightened myself at all</s> i was in great danger annie</s>  just at the time my mother dreamt aboutme surajah ibrahim and i were attacked by a party of stranglersdisguised as merchants and if it had not been that i had some strangesuspicion of them we should all have been murdered</s>  as it was weshot the whole gang who fortunately for us had no firearms</s> it must have been your mother who warned you annie said gravely</s> she told us that she dreamt you were in some terrible danger thoughshe could not remember what it was and she tried with all her mightto warn you</s> perhaps it was that annie</s>  i dont know why i suspected them sostronglysurajah quite laughed at the idea</s>  anyhow it saved ourlives</s> and how are you getting on annie</s>  are you happy</s> oh so happy</s>  she exclaimed</s>  at least i was until your mother gotill and i was working very hard at my lessons but of course that hasall been stopped as far as taking them from her is concerned</s>  but ihave gone on working and the rajahs sons have been very good andhelped me sometimes and i begin to read words of two letters</s>  andwhat has brought you back so soon</s> that i cant tell you yet annie</s>  i will only tell you that it is notbad news and no one but my uncle will know more than that till ihave told my mothereven my aunt wont hear it</s> has surajah come back too dick</s> yes i heard horses in the courtyard just now and i have no doubt itwas him</s>  i rode on first being anxious to see my mother</s> they chatted for a few minutes</s>  then the rajah came to the door andcalled dick into the next room</s> i have settled your father in the room at the other end of thegallery dick</s>  he agreed with me that it was better for him to keepthere by himself until you have told your mother that he is here</s>  ihave just ordered a meal to be sent and after that will send mybarber in to shave him</s>  he says your mother will never recognise himwith all that hair on his face</s>  i am going to see if something cannotbe done to take the stain off his face and shall then set half adozen tailors to work on some dark blue cloth to turn him out a suitbefore tomorrow morning in what he calls sailor fashion so that hemay appear before your mother in something like the style in which sheremembers him</s> a few minutes later gholla came in and said that mrs</s>  holland wasready for dick to go in to her</s>  dick found his mother looking pale andweak but the joy of his coming had already brightened her eyes andgiven a faint flush to her cheeks</s> i have been so dreadfully anxious dick she said after the firstembrace</s>  i was certain you had been in some terrible danger</s> i have been but thank god i escaped owing i think to the warningannie says you tried to give me</s>  but we must not talk about that now</s> i will tell you all the story tomorrow</s>  you are not fit to talk</s>  youmust take some broth and some wine and a sleeping draught and ihope you will go off and not wake up till tomorrow morning</s> now you do as i tell you</s>  while you are drinking your broth i willgo in and take something to eat for i have had nothing today and amas hungry as a hunter</s>  then i will come back and sit by you till yougo off to sleep</s> he was not long away but he was met at the door by his aunt whosaidshe has gone off already dick</s>  i have no doubt that she will sleepmany hours but if she wakes i will let you know at once</s> if that is the case gholla the rajah who had come in at the samemoment said i can let you into a secret which no one but myselfknows yet but which now that margaret is asleep can be told</s> gholla was very pleased when she heard the news and dick went off atonce to his father</s>  it was a great relief to the latter to know thathis wife had gone off to sleep and would probably be well enough tohave the news broken to her in the morning</s> i hear that you are preparing for the meeting father by gettingyourself shaved and having a blue cloth suit made</s> yes dick</s>  i should like to be as much like my old self as possible</s> i dont think mother will care much what you look like father</s> still it is very natural that you should want to get rid of all thathair</s> what bothers me lad captain holland went on putting his hand tothe back of his neck is this shaved spot here</s>  of course with theturban on and the native rig it was all right but it will look a rumaffair in english clothes</s> dick could not help laughing at his fathers look of perplexity</s> well father it is just the same with myself</s>  i have not changedyet but when i do the hair above which is now tucked up under theturban will be quite long enough to come down to the nape of theneck and hide that bare place till the hair grows again</s> yes i did not think of that</s>  my hair is long enough to come downover my shoulders</s>  i was going to tell the barber to cut it short allover but i will see now that he allows for that</s> now father do you mind my bringing in annie mansfield</s>  i know shewill be wanting to keep close to me all day and i should never beable to get rid of her without telling her about you</s> bring her in by all means dick</s>  she must be a plucky young girl bywhat you said about her</s> where have you been dick</s>  annie inquired when dick went out a fewminutes later</s>  i have been looking for you everywhere</s>  nobody hadseen you unless it was the rajah</s>  i asked him and he said thatlittle girls must not ask questions and then laughed</s> you have not brought home another white girl</s>  she exclaimedsuddenly</s> would it not be very nice for you to have a companion annie</s> no she said sharply i should not like it at all</s> well i will take you in to see her and i think you will like her</s> no i am only joking he broke off as he saw tears start into hereyes</s>  it is not another girl</s>  but you shall see for yourself</s> he took her hand and led her to his fathers room</s> there annie this is the gentleman who has come back with me thistime</s> annie looked at captain holland in surprise and then turned her eyesto dick for an explanation</s> he is a respectablelooking old native isnt he annie</s> yes he looks respectable annie said gravely but he doesnt lookvery old</s>  why has he come down with you dick</s>  he cant have been aslave</s> but i have lass the captain said in english to annies intenseastonishment</s>  i have been in their hands a year or so longer than youwere</s> annie turned impulsively to dick and grasped his arm</s> oh dick she said in an excited whisper</s>  is itis it yourfather after all</s> ay lass the captain answered for him</s>  i am the boys father anda happy father too as you may guess at finding i have such a son</s> and i hear he has been a good friend to you too</s> oh he has he has indeed</s>  annie cried running forward and seizinghis hands in both of hers</s>  i dont think there ever was anyone sokind and good</s> what bosh annie</s>  dick exclaimed almost crossly</s> never mind what he says my dear</s>  you and i know all about it</s>  now wecan do very well without him for a time</s>  he can go and tell his uncleand cousins all about his adventures which i have no doubt they aredying to hear and you and i can sit here and exchange confidencesuntil my barber comes</s>  i dont look much like an englishman now but ihope that they will be able to get me something that will take thisstain off my face</s> mrs</s>  holland did not wake till evening</s>  she seemed very much betterand had a short chat with dick</s>  she would have got up had he not toldher that he should be going to bed himself in a short time and thatall his story would keep very well until the morning when he hoped tofind her quite herself again</s> by dint of the application of various unguents and a vast amount ofhard scrubbing captain holland restored his face to its original hue</s> i look a bit sunburnt he said but i have often come back brownerthan this from some of my voyages</s> you look quite like yourself in your portrait at home father dicksaid</s>  it is the shaving and cutting your hair even more than gettingoff the dye that has made the difference</s>  i dont think you look mucholder than you did then except that there are a few grey hairs</s> i shall look better tomorrow dick when i get these outlandishthings off</s>  i have been trying on my new suit and i think it will dofirst rate</s>  those clothes that you wore on board ship and handed tothem as a model gave them the idea of what i wanted</s> and indeed the next morning when captain holland appeared in his newsuit dick declared that he looked just as if he had walked down fromhis picture</s>  the ranee had agreed to break the news to mrs</s>  hollandas soon as she was dressed</s>  she came into the room where the otherswere waiting for breakfast and said to captain hollandcome</s>  she knows all and has borne it well</s> she led him to the door of mrs</s>  hollands room and opened it</s>  as heentered there was a cry ofoh jack</s>  my jack</s> then she closed it behind him and left husband and wife together</s> a few days afterwards there was a family consultation</s> now dick his father said we must settle about your plans</s>  youknow we have decided upon going home by the next ship and takingannie with us without waiting for her fathers letter</s>  of course ishall have no difficulty in finding out when i get there what hisaddress is</s>  i have promised your mother to give up the sea and settledown again at shadwell where i can meet old friends and shall feel athome</s>  we have had a long talk over what you said the other nightabout your insisting that we should take the money those jewels ofyours fetch</s>  well we wont do that</s> then i will sell them father dick said positively and give themoney to a hospital</s> i have not finished yet dick</s>  we wont take all the money but wehave agreed that we will take a quarter of it</s>  of course we couldmanage on my savings as your mother did when i was away</s>  we shalllose the little allowance the company made her but i shall buy ashare in a ship with my money which will bring in a good deal betterrate of interest than she got for it in the funds so we could stillmanage very well</s>  still as we feel that it would please you we agreeto take a quarter of the money the jewels fetch and that with what ihave will give us an income well beyond our wants</s>  so that issettled</s> now about yourself</s>  i really dont think that you can do better thanwhat you proposed when we were talking of it yesterday</s>
 you would belike a fish out of water in england if you had nothing to occupyyour time and therefore cant do better than enter the service hereand remain at any rate for a few years</s> as your commission was dated from the time you joined lordcornwallis two and a half years ago you wont be at the bottom ofthe tree and while you are serving you will want no money here andthe interest of your capital will be accumulating</s>  if i invest it inshipping for you you will get eight or ten percent for it and as ishall pick good ships commanded by men i know and will divide themoney up in small shares among half a dozen of them there will bepractically no riskand of course the vessels will be insured</s>  sothat at the end of ten years by reinvesting the profits your moneywill be more than doubled and you will have a nice fortune when youchoose to come home even if the jewels do not fetch anything likewhat you expect</s> a week later the party journeyed down to madras where they stayed fora fortnight</s>  dick on his arrival called upon the governor whocongratulated him most heartily when he heard that he had succeeded infinding and releasing his father and at once appointed him to one ofthe native cavalry regiments and his parents had the satisfaction ofseeing him in uniform before they started</s>  annie showed but littleinterest in the thought of going to england and being restored to herparents being at the time too much distressed at parting from dick togive any thought to other matters</s>  but at last the goodbyes were allsaid and as the anchor was weighed dick returned on shore in a surfboat and next day joined his regiment</s> surajah had wanted to accompany him to madras and to enlist in anyregiment to which he might be appointed and the assurance that itmight be a long time before he became a native officer as these werealways chosen from the ranks except in the case of raising newregiments had little influence with him</s>  the rajah however hadfinally persuaded him to stay by the argument that his father whowas now getting on in years would sorely miss him that the captainof the troop would also be retiring shortly and that he should as areward for his faithful services to his nephew appoint him to thecommand as soon as it was vacant</s>  ibrahim entered the rajahs servicepreferring that to soldiering</s> chapter 21 home</s> it was early in december 1792 that dick holland joined his regimentwhich was stationed at madras</s>  there were but five other officers anddick found to his satisfaction that the junior of them had had fouryears service</s>  consequently he did not step over any ones headowing to his commission being dated nearly three years previously</s>  asthere were in the garrison many officers who had served on thegeneral staff in the last war dick soon found some of his formeracquaintances and the story of his long search for his father andits successful termination soon spread and gained for him a place incivil as well as military society</s> the next year passed peacefully and was an unusually quiet time inindia</s>  that tippoo intended to renew the war as soon as he was ablewas well known to the government and one of its chief objects ofsolicitude was the endeavour to counteract the secret negotiationsthat were constantly going on between him the nizam and themahrattis</s> tippoo was known to have sent confidential messengers to all the greatprinces of indiaeven to the ruler of afghanistaninviting them tojoin the confederacy of the mahrattis the nizam and himself todrive the english out of india altogether</s>  still greater cause foruneasiness was the alliance that tippoo had endeavoured to make withthe french who as he had learned had gained great successes ineurope and believing from their account that their country was muchstronger than england he had sent envoys to the mauritius to proposean offensive and defensive alliance against england</s>  the envoys hadbeen politely received and some of them had proceeded to francewhere tippoos proposal had been accepted</s>  they committed franceindeed to nothing as she was already at war with england but thefrench were extremely glad to embrace the proposal of tippoo as theyoverrated his power and believed that he would prove a formidableopponent to the english and would necessitate the employment ofadditional troops and ships there and so weaken englands power athome</s>  to confirm the alliance some sixty or seventy frenchmen mostlyadventurers were sent from the mauritius as civil and militaryofficers</s> tippoos council had been strongly opposed to this step on his part</s> they had pointed out to him that their alliance with a power at warwith the english would render war between the english and himinevitable and that france was not in a position to aid them in anyway</s>  the only benefit indeed that he could gain was the possibilitythat the fourteen thousand french troops in the service of the nizammight revolt and come over to him but even this was doubtful asthese were not troops belonging to the french government but anindependent body raised and officered by adventurers who might notbe willing to imperil their own position and interests by embarkingon a hazardous war at the orders of a fardistant government</s> these events happened soon after dicks return but nothing wasgenerally known of what was passing although reports of tippoosproceedings had reached the government of india</s>  the party offrenchmen arrived at seringapatam and were at first well received bytippoo</s>  but they had soon disgusted him by their assumption ofdictatorial powers while they on their part were disappointed atnot receiving the emoluments and salaries they had expected</s>  most ofthem very speedily left his service</s>  some of the military men wereemployed at bangalore and other towns in drilling the troops and afew remained at seringapatam neglected by tippoo whose eyes were nowopen to the character of these adventurers</s>  but this in no way shookhis belief that he would obtain great aid from france as he hadreceived letters from official personages there encouraging him tocombine with other native powers to drive the english out of indiaand promising large aid in troops and ships</s> when the earl of morningtonafterwards the marquis ofwellesleyarrived at calcutta as governor general of india in may1798 the situation had become so critical that although war had notbeen absolutely declared on either side tippoos open alliance withthe french rendered it certain that hostilities must commence erelong and lord mornington lost no time in proceeding to makepreparations for war</s>  as lord cornwallis had done he found thegreatest difficulty in inducing the supine government of madras totake any steps</s>  they protested that were they to make any show ofactivity tippoo would descend the ghauts and at once ravage thewhole country and they declared that they had no force whatever thatcould withstand him</s>  they continued in their cowardly inactivity untilthe governor general was forced to override their authorityaltogether and take the matter into his own hands</s> the first step was to curb the nizams power for everything pointedto the probability that he intended to join mysore being inclined soto do by tippoos promises and by the influence of the officers ofthe strong body of french troops in his service</s>  negotiations weretherefore opened by lord mornington who offered to guarantee thenizams dominions if he would join the english against tippoo andpromised that after the war he should obtain a large share of theterritory taken from mysore</s> the nizams position was a difficult one</s>  on one side of him lay thedominions of his warlike and powerful neighbour tippoo</s>  on the otherhe was exposed to the incursions of the mahrattis whose rising powerwas a constant threat to his safety</s>  he had moreover to cope with aserious rebellion by his son ali jah</s> he was willing enough to obtain the guarantee of the english againstaggressions by the mahrattis but he hesitated in complying with thepreliminary demand that he should dispense with the french</s>  thefighting powers of this body rendered them valuable auxiliaries buthe secretly feared them and resented their pretensions which pointedto the fact that ere long instead of being his servants they mightbecome his masters</s>  when therefore the british government offeredhim a subsidiary force of six battalions and to guarantee him againstany further aggression by the mahrattis he accepted the proposal butin a halfhearted way that showed he could not be relied upon for anyefficient assistance in disarming his french auxiliaries</s> no time was lost by the government in marching the promised force tohyderabad</s>  the french 14000 strong refused to disband and werejoined by the nizams household force which was in the frenchinterest</s>  the nizam terrified at the prospect of a contest thesuccess of which was doubtful abandoned the capital and took refugein a fortress there to await the issue of events but positivelyrefused to issue orders to the french to disband</s>  two of the englishbattalions which were on the other side of the river to that on whichthe french were encamped opened a destructive fire upon them andwith redhot shot set fire to their magazines and storehouses whilethe other four battalions moved into position to make a direct attack</s> the nizam now saw that he had no alternative but to declare openly forthe french or to dismiss them</s>  he preferred the latter alternative</s> peron who commanded the french saw that unless he surrendered theposition of his force was desperate</s>  accordingly on receipt of theorder he and his officers expressed their readiness to accept theirdismissal</s>  their men were however in a state of mutiny and theofficers were compelled to make their escape from the camp under coverof night</s>  the next morning the camp was surrounded by the english andthe troops of the nizam and the french then surrendered without ashot being fired</s> while the nizam was thus rendered powerless negotiations had beengoing on with the mahrattis but owing to the quarrels and jealousiesof their chiefs nothing could be done with them</s>  it was howeverapparent that for the same reason tippoo would equally fail in hisattempt to obtain their alliance against us and that therefore it waswith mysore alone that we should have to deal</s> in the meantime though preparing for war lord mornington was mostanxious to avoid it</s>  when tippoo wrote to complain that some villagesof his had been occupied by people from coorg the governor generalordered their immediate restoration to him</s>  in november he sent thesultan a friendly letter pointing out that he could look for noefficient aid from france and that any auxiliaries who might possiblyjoin him would only introduce the principles of anarchy and thehatred of all religion that animated the whole french nation thathis alliance with them was really equivalent to a declaration of waragainst england and as he was unwilling to believe that tippoo wasactuated by unfriendly feelings or desired to break the engagementsof the treaty entered into with him he offered to send an officer tomysore to discuss any points upon which variance might have arisenand to arrange a scheme that would be satisfactory to them both</s> to this letter no answer was received for five weeks by which timelord mornington had arrived at madras</s>  he then received a lettercontaining a tissue of the most palpable lies concerning tippoosdealings with the french</s>  two or three more letters passed but astippoos answers were all vague and evasive the governor generalissued a manifesto on the 22nd of february 1799 recapitulating allthe grievances against mysore and declaring that though the allieswere prepared to repel any attack they were equally anxious to effectan arrangement with him</s> but tippoo still believed that a large french army would speedilyarrive</s>  he had received letters from buonaparte in person writtenfrom egypt and saying that he had arrived on the borders of the redsea with an innumerable and invincible army full of the desire todeliver you from the iron yoke of england</s>  tippoo well knew alsothat although the governor general spoke for himself and his alliesthe nizam was powerless to render any assistance to the english andthat the mahrattis were far more likely to join him than they were toassist his foes</s> the manifesto of lord mornington was speedily followed by action forat the end of january an army of nearly 37000 men had been assembledat vellore</s>  of these some 20000 were the madras force</s>  with them werethe nizams army nominally commanded by meer alum but really bycolonel wellesleyafterwards duke of wellingtonwho had with him hisown regiment the 33rd 6500 men under colonel dalrymple 3621infantry for the most part french troops who had reenlisted underus and 6000 regular and irregular horse</s> dick who had now attained the rank of captain had been introduced byone of lord cornwalliss old staff officers to general harris who asgeneral of the madras army was in command of the whole</s>  on hearing ofthe services dick had rendered in the last war and that his perfectacquaintance with the language and with the ground over which thearmy would pass would enable him to be equally efficient on thepresent occasion general harris at once detached him from servicewith the regiment and appointed him to a post on his own staff</s> had it not been that dick had seen for the last two years thathostilities must ere long be commenced with tippoo he would beforethis have left the army and returned home</s>  he was heartily tired ofthe long inaction</s>  when the regiment was stationed at madras life wasvery pleasant but a considerable portion of his time was spent at outstations where the duties were very light and there was nothing tobreak the monotony of camp life</s>  he received letters regularly fromhis mother who gave him full details of their home life</s> the first that he received merely announced their safe arrival inengland</s>  the second was longer and more interesting</s>  they had had nodifficulty in discovering the address of annies father and onwriting to him he had immediately come up to town</s>  he had lost hiswife on his voyage home from india and was overjoyed at thediscovery of his daughter and at her return to england</s> he is dicks mother wrote very much broken in health</s>  anniebehaved very nicely</s>  poor child it was only natural that after whatyou did for her and our being all that time with her the thought ofleaving us for her parent of whom she had no recollection was agreat grief</s>  however i talked it over with her many times andpointed out to her that her first duty was to the father who had beenso many years deprived of her and that although there was no reasonwhy she should not manifest affection for us she must not allow himto think for a moment that she was not as pleased to see him as hewas to welcome her</s>  she behaved beautifully when her father arrivedand when he had been in the house five minutes and spoke of the deathof his wife his bitter regret that she had not lived to see annierestored to them the loneliness of his life and how it would bebrightened now that she was again with him his words so touched herthat she threw herself into his arms and sobbed out that she would doall she could to make his life happy</s>  he had of course received theletter we had written to him from tripataly and quite pained me bythe gratitude he showed for what he called my kindness to hisdaughter</s> he said that by this post he should write to endeavour to expresssome of his feelings to you</s>  annie went away with him the next day toa place he has bought near plymouth</s>  he has promised to let us haveher for a month every year and we have promised to go down for thesame time every summer to stay with her</s>  he asks numberlessquestions about you which neither i nor annie are ever tired ofanswering</s>  even with a mothers natural partiality i must own thather descriptions are almost too flattering and he must think that youare one of the most admirable of men</s> next as to the jewels</s>  your father took them to be valued by severaldiamond merchants and accepted the highest offer which was16000 pounds of which he has already invested twelve in your namein shares in six ships</s>  four of these are indiamen</s>  the other two areprivateers</s>  he said that he did not think you would object to aquarter of the money being put into a speculative venture and thatthey were both good craft well armed and well commanded with strongcrews and would if successful earn as much in a year as amerchantman would in ten</s> since then the letters had been of a uniform character</s>  the shares inthe indiamen were giving a good and steady return</s>  the privateers hadbeen very fortunate and had captured some rich prizes</s>  annie had beenup or they had been down at plymouth</s>  the letters during the lastthree years had reported her as having grown into a young woman andas his mother declared a very pretty one</s>  after that the allusions toher were less frequent but it was mentioned that she was as fond ofthem as ever and that she was still unmarried</s> she always asks when you are coming home dick mrs</s>  holland saidin the last letter he had received before accompanying general harristo vellore</s>  i told her of course that your last letter said thatwar was certain with tippoo that you hoped this time to seeseringapatam taken and the tyrants power broken and that after itwas over you would come home on leave and perhaps would not go outagain</s> during the six years that he had been in the army dick had veryfrequently been at tripataly as there was little difficulty ingetting leave for a fortnight</s>  his cousins had now grown up into youngmen surajah commanded the troop and his stays there were alwaysextremely pleasant</s>  the troop now numbered two hundred for with quiettimes the population of the territory had largely increased and therajahs income grown in proportion</s>  the troop was now dressed inuniform and in arms and discipline resembled the irregular cavalry inthe companys service and when dick arrived at vellore he found hisuncle and cousins there with their cavalry</s> i thought dick of only sending the boys the rajah said but whenthe time came for them to start i felt that i must go myself</s>  we havesuffered enough at the hands of mysore and i do hope to see tippooscapital taken and his power of mischief put an end to for good andall</s> i am glad indeed that you are coming uncle</s>  you may be sure thatwhenever i can get away from my duties with the general i shall spendmost of my time in your camp though i must occasionally drop in on myown regiment</s> the rajah had already been down to madras a month before and with hissons had been introduced to general harris by the latters chief ofthe staff as having been always like his father before him afaithful ally of the english and as having accompanied lordcornwallis on the occasion of the last campaign in mysore</s>  the generalhad thanked him heartily for his offer to place his two hundredcavalry at the disposal of the government and had expressed a hopethat he as well as his sons would accompany it in the field</s> on the 11th of february 1799 the army moved from vellore butinstead of ascending by the pass of amboor as had been expected itmoved southwest ascended the pass of paliode and on the 9th of marchwas established without opposition in tippoos territory at adistance of eighty miles east of his capital</s>  they then marched northuntil they reached a village ten miles south of bangalore</s>  this routealthough circuitous was chosen as the roads were better the countrymore level and cultivation much more general affording far greaterfacilities for the collection of forage for the baggage animals</s> hitherto nothing had been seen of the mysorean army</s>  it had beenconfidently expected that tippoo would fight at least one greatbattle to oppose their advance against his capital but so far nosigns had been seen of an enemy and even the mysore horse which hadplayed so conspicuous a part in the last campaign in no wayinterfered with the advance of the army or even with the foragingparties</s> a despatch that reached them by a circuitous route explained whytippoo had suffered them to advance so far unmolested</s>  while themadras army had advanced from the southeast a bombay force 6500strong was ascending the western ghauts</s>  as the advance brigadeconsisting of three native battalions under colonel montresorreached sedaseer tippoo with 12000 of his best troops fell upon itsuddenly</s>  his force had moved through the jungle and attacked thebrigade in front and rear</s> although thus surprised by an enemy nearly six times their superiorin force the sepoys behaved with a calmness and bravery that couldnot have been surpassed by veteran troops</s>  maintaining a steady frontthey repulsed every attack until a brigade encamped eight miles intheir rear came up to their assistance and tippoo was then forced toretreat having suffered a loss of 1500 men including many of hisbest officers</s> this proof of the inferiority of his troops even when enormouslyoutnumbering the english and fighting with all the advantages ofsurprise profoundly impressed tippoo and from this time he appearedto regard the struggle as hopeless and displayed no signs whatever ofthe dash and energy that had distinguished him when leading one ofthe divisions of his fathers army</s>  he marched with his troopsstraight to seringapatam and then moved out with his whole force togive battle to the main body of the invaders</s>  the antagonists camewithin sight of each other at the village of malavilly thirty mileseast of the capital</s>  for some time an artillery fire on both sides waskept up</s>  gradually the infantry became engaged and the mysoreansshowed both courage and steadiness until a column of two thousand menmoved forward to attack the 33rd regiment</s> the british troops reserved their fire until the column was withinfifty yards of them</s>  then they poured in a withering volley andcharged</s>  the column fell back in disorder</s>  general floyd at oncecharged them with five regiments of cavalry sabred great numbers ofthem and drove the remainder back in headlong rout</s>  the whole britishline then advanced cheering loudly</s>  the first line of tippoos armyfell back upon its second and the whole then marched away at a speedthat soon left the british infantry far behind them</s> instead of continuing his march straight upon the capital generalharris learning from spies that tippoo had wasted the whole countryalong that line moved southwest collecting as he went greatquantities of cattle sheep and goats and an abundance of grain andforage crossed the cauvery at a ford at sosilay and on the 5th ofapril took up his position at a distance of two miles from thewestern face of the fort of seringapatam</s> this movement completely disconcerted tippoo</s>  he had imagined that theattack would as on the previous occasion take place on the northernside of the river and had covered the approaches there with a seriesof additional fortifications while on the other side he had done butlittle</s>  so despondent was he that he called together his principalofficers and said to themwe have arrived at our last stage</s>  what is your determination</s> his advisers took no brighter view of the prospect than he didhimself</s>  they had unanimously opposed the war had warned tippooagainst trusting to the french and had been adverse to measures thatcould but result in a fresh trial of strength with the english</s>  thesultan however while not attempting to combat their opinion hadgone on his own way and his officers now saw their worst fearsjustified</s>  they replied to his questionour determination is to die with you</s> on the day after arriving before seringapatam the british attackedthe villages and rocky eminences held by the enemy on the south sideof the river and drove them back under the shelter of their guns</s> general floyd was sent with the cavalry to meet the bombay force andescort it to seringapatam</s>  this was accomplished and although thewhole of the mysore cavalry and a strong force of infantry hoveredround the column they did not venture to engage it and on the 14ththe whole arrived at the camp before seringapatam</s> the bombay force which was commanded by general stuart crossed tothe north bank of the river and took up a position there whichenabled them to take in flank the outlying works and trenches withwhich tippoo had hoped to prevent any attack upon the western angle ofthe fort where the river was so shallow that it could be easilyforded</s> tippoo now endeavoured to negotiate and asked for a conference</s> general harris returned an answer enclosing the draft of apreliminary treaty with which he had been supplied before starting</s> it demanded one half of tippoos territories a payment of twomillions sterling and the delivery of four of his sons as hostages</s> tippoo returned no reply and on the 22nd the garrison made a vigoroussortie and were only repulsed after several hours fighting</s> for the next five days the batteries of the besiegers kept up a heavyfire silenced every gun in the outlying works and compelled theirdefenders to retire across the river into the fort</s>  tippoo now sankinto such a state of despondency that he would listen to none of theproposals of his officers for strengthening the position and wouldnot even agree to the construction of a retrenchment which would cutoff the western angle of the fort against which it was evident thatthe attack would be directed</s> he knew that if captured there was little chance of his beingpermitted to continue to reign and had indeed made that prospectmore hopeless by massacring all the english prisoners who had by hisorder been brought in from the hill forts throughout the country onhis return to seringapatam after the repulse he had suffered in hisattack on the bombay force</s> on the 2nd of may the batteries opened on the wall of the fort nearits northwest angle and so heavy was their fire that by the eveningof the 3rd a breach of sixty yards long was effected</s>  general harrisdetermined to assault on the following day</s>  general baird who hadfor four years been a prisoner in seringapatam volunteered to leadthe assault and before daybreak 4376 men took their places in theadvance trenches where they lay down</s> it was determined that the assault should not be made until oneoclock at which time tippoos troops anticipating no attack wouldbe taking their food and resting during the heat of the day</s>  thetroops who were to make the assault were divided into two columnswhich after mounting the breach were to turn right and leftfighting their way along the ramparts until they met at the other end</s> a powerful reserve under colonel wellesley was to support them afterthey had entered</s> when the signal was given the troops leapt from the trenches andcovered by the fire of the artillery which at the same moment openedon the ramparts dashed across the river scaled the breach and insix minutes from the firing of the signal gun planted the britishflag on its crest</s> then the heads of the two columns at once started to fight their wayalong the ramparts</s>  at first the resistance was slight</s>  surprised andpanic stricken the defenders of the strong works at this pointoffered but a feeble resistance</s>  some fled along the walls</s>  some randown into the fort</s>  many threw themselves over the wall into the rockybed of the river</s>  the right column in less than an hour had won itsway along the rampart to the eastern face of the fort but the leftcolumn met with a desperate resistance for as each point was carriedthe enemy constantly reinforced made a fresh stand</s>  most of theofficers who led the column were shot down and so heavy was the firethat several times the advance was brought to a standstill</s> it was not until the right column making their way along the wall tothe assistance of their comrades took them in the rear that themysoreans entirely lost heart</s>  taken between two fires they speedilybecame a disorganised mass</s>  many hundreds were shot down either inthe fort or as pouring out through the river gate they endeavouredto cross the ford and escape to the north</s> as soon as the whole rampart was captured general baird sent anofficer with a flag of truce to the palace to offer protection totippoo and all its inmates on condition of immediate surrender</s>  twoof tippoos younger sons assured the officer that the sultan was notin the palace</s>  the assurance was disbelieved and the princes beingsent to the camp under a strong escort the palace was searched</s>  theofficer in command on being strictly questioned declared thattippoo who had in person commanded the defence made against the leftcolumn had been wounded and that he had heard he was lying in agateway on the north side of the fort</s> a search was immediately made and the information proved correct</s> tippoo was found lying there not only wounded but dead</s>  he hadindeed received several wounds and was endeavouring to escape in hispalanquin when this had been upset by the rush of fugitives strivingto make their way through the gate</s> the gateway was indeed almost choked up with the bodies of those whohad been either suffocated in the crush or killed by their pursuers</s> on his palanquin being overturned tippoo had evidently risen to hisfeet and had at the same moment been shot through the head by anenglish soldier ignorant of his rank</s>  in the evening he was buriedwith much state by the side of his father in the mausoleum of lalbang at the eastern extremity of the island</s> it was with great difficulty that when the british soldiers becameaware of the massacre of their countrymen a few days before theywere restrained from taking vengeance upon his sons and the inmates ofthe palace</s>  in the assault 8000 of the defenders were killed whilethe loss of the british during the siege and in the assault amountedto 825 europeans and 639 native troops</s>  an enormous quantity ofcannon arms and ammunition was captured and the value of thetreasure and jewels amounted to considerably over a million poundsbesides the doubtless large amount of jewels that had in the firstconfusion fallen into the hands of the soldiers</s> as dick after the fighting had ceased went by order of the generalto examine the prisoners and ascertain their rank his eye fell uponan old officer whose arm hung useless by his side broken by a musketball</s>  he went up to him and held out his hand</s> mirzah mahomed buckshy</s>  he exclaimed</s>  i am glad to meet you againalthough sorry to see that you are wounded</s> the officer looked at him in surprise</s> you have spoken my name he said but i do not know that we haveever met before</s> we have met

carry the pistols i left for you and doubtless youalso received the letter i placed with them</s> thanks be to allah the old colonel said that we have thus metagain</s>  truly i rejoiced when my first

for he will ever retain a gratefulremembrance of your kindness</s>  now i must finish my work here and willthen go to the general and beg him to give me an order for yourrelease</s> an hour later dick returned with the order and carried mahomedbuckshy off to the rajahs camp</s>  here his arm was set by one of thesurgeons and he was so well cared for by the rajah dick andsurajah that a fortnight later he was convalescent and was able tojoin his wife in the town</s> i am thankful he said on leaving that my life as a soldier isover and that i shall never more have to fight against the english</s> tippoo was my master but it is he who by his cruelty and ambitionhas brought ruin upon mysore</s>  i have saved enough to live in comfortfor the rest of my life and to its end i shall rejoice that i haveagain met the son of my friend jack</s> the capture of seringapatam was followed at once by the entiresubmission of the whole country</s>  a descendant of the old rajah ofmysore was placed upon the throne</s>  his rule was however but anominal one</s>  a very large amount of territory was annexed</s>  the islandof seringapatam was permanently occupied as a british possession</s>  thenew rajah was bound to receive and pay a large military force forthe defence of his territories not to admit any european foreignersinto his dominions to allow the company to garrison any fort inmysore that might seem advisable to them and to pay at all timesattention to such advice as might be given him as to theadministration of his affairs</s>  he was in fact to be but a puppetthe british becoming the absolute rulers of mysore</s> the family of tippoo and the ladies of the harem were removed tovellore where they were to receive a palace suitable to their formerrank and expectations and allowances amounting to 160000 pounds ayear</s> thus mysore one of the most ancient and powerful of the kingdoms ofindia fell into the hands of the english owing to the ambitionbigotry and besotted cruelty of the son of a usurper</s> dicks part in all these operations had been a busy although not avery dangerous one</s>  the only share he had taken in the active fightinghad been in the battle at malavilly where having been sent with amessage to colonel floyd just before he led the cavalry to theassault of the column that had attacked the 33rd he took his place bythe side of the rajah and his cousins whose troop formed part offloyds command and joined in the charge on the enemy</s>  he hadhowever rendered great services in the quartermasters departmentwas very highly spoken of in the despatches of general harris and hisname appeared as promoted to the rank of major in the list ofhonours promulgated by lord mornington at the termination of thecampaign</s> his regiment was among those selected for the occupation of mysoreand a month after the capture of the city he obtained leave toreturn to england</s>  he stayed for a week at tripataly and then took anaffectionate farewell of his uncle the ranee his cousins andsurajah and sailed from madras a fortnight later</s>  the ship in whichhe was a passenger was accompanied by two other indiamen and when afortnight out they encountered a french frigate which however theybeat off and arrived in england without further adventure</s> as soon as he landed dick drove to the house where his father andmother had taken up their residence on their arrival in england buthe found to his surprise that eight months before they had moved toanother in the village of hackney</s>  he proceeded there and found itto be a considerably larger one than that they had left and standingin its own grounds which were of some extent</s>  he had written to themafter the fall of seringapatam and told them that he should probablysail for england about six weeks later</s>  as the vehicle drove to thedoor his father and mother ran out</s>  his father grasped his hand andhis mother threw her aims round his neck with tears of joy</s> as soon as the first greeting was over dick saw a young lady in deepmourning standing on the steps</s>  he looked at her for a moment insurprise and then exclaimedit is annie mansfield</s> annie held out her hand and laughed</s> we are both changed almost beyond recognition dick</s> then she added demurely the last time i had to ask youyou shant have

few months now</s>  as he had no near relations he left the whole ofhis property to her and having been in india in the days when underwarren hastings there were good pickings to be obtained it amountedto a handsome fortune</s>  she said that she should come and live with usat any rate until she became of age and as that house of ours thougha comfortable place was hardly the sort of house for an heiress sheherself proposed that we should take a larger house between us</s>
and so here we are</s>  we shall stay here through the winter and thenwe are going down to her place at plymouth for the summer</s>  what weshall do afterwards is not settled</s>  that must depend upon a varietyof things</s> she has grown much prettier than i ever thought she would do dicksaid</s>  of course i knew she would have grown into a woman butsomehow i never realised it until i saw her and i believe i havealways thought of her as being still the girl i carried off fromseringapatam</s> in a few minutes annie joined them and the talk then turned uponindia and many questions were asked as to their friends at tripataly</s> i suppose by this time annieat least i hope i may still call youannie</s> if you call me anything else i shall not answer she saidindignantly</s> well i was going to say i suppose you have got a good deal beyondwords of two letters now</s> i regard the question as an impertinent one</s>  i have even masteredgeography the meaning of which word you may remember you explainedto me and i have a partial knowledge of history</s> the next day dick met an old friend ben birket</s>  dick had kept hispromise and had written to him as soon as he returned to tripatalywith his father and a few weeks after captain hollands return hisold shipmate came to see him and his wife</s>  ben had for some timethought of retiring and he now left the sea and settled down in alittle cottage near</s>  captain holland insisted upon settling a smallpension upon him and he was always a welcome guest at the house</s>  hisdelight at dicks return was extreme</s> i never thought you would do it master dick never for a moment andwhen on coming home i got your letter and found that the captain andyour mother were in england it just knocked me foolish for a bit</s> three weeks later dick told annie that he loved her</s>  he spoke withoutany circumlocution merely taking her hand one evening when theyhappened to be alone together and telling her so in plain words</s> i know nothing of women annie he said or their ways</s>  i have beenbothering myself how to set about it but though i dont know how toput it i do know that i love you dearly</s>  all these years i have

gotold enough to look upon myself as a woman and young men began to cometo the house i said to my dear fatherit is of no use their coming here father</s>  my mind has been made upfor years and i shall never change</s> he knew at once what i meant</s> i dont blame you my dear he said</s>  of course you are young atpresent but he has won you fairly and if he is at all like what youmake him out to be i could not leave you in better hands</s>  he will behome in another three or four years and i shall have the comfort ofhaving you with me until then</s>  but you must not make too sure of it</s> he may fall in love out there</s>  you know that there is plenty ofsociety at madras</s> i laughed at the idea</s> all the pretty ones either come out to be married or get engaged onthe voyage or before

should retain the house which indeed theycould well afford to do and that dick and annie should reside therewhenever they were in town but that as a rule they would live atthe estate her father had purchased near plymouth</s>  their means wereample for during the eight years he was in the service dicks 12000pounds had as his father had predicted doubled itself and anniesfortune was at least as
