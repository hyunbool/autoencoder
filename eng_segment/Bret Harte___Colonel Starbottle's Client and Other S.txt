that this frank and unaffected expression of someobscure disgust with his own present position had no other implicationthat the colonel did not except to it</s>  yet the man did not go on</s>

heavywith its sweets</s>  the gallant colonel nodded with confidential affabilityto the spotlessshirted barkeeper and then taking corbin by the armfraternally conducted him into a small apartment in the rear of thebarroom</s>  it was evidently used as the office of the proprietor andcontained a plain desk table and chairs</s>  at the rear window naturenot entirely evicted looked in with a few

 from the adjoining room thefaint monotonous click of billiard balls languidly played came atintervals like the dry notes of cicale in the bushes</s> the barkeeper brought two glasses crowned with mint and diademed withbroken ice</s>  the colonel took a long pull at his portion and leanedback in his chair with a bland gulp of satisfaction and dreamily patienteyes</s>  the stranger mechanically sipped the contents of his glass andthen without having altered his reluctant expression drew from hisbreastpocket a number of old letters</s>  holding them displayed in hisfingers like a difficult hand of cards and with something of the air ofa dispirited player he beganyou see about six months after this yer trouble i got this letter</s>  hepicked out a well worn badly written missive and put it into colonelstarbottles hands rising at the same time and leaning over him as heread</s>  you see she that writ it says as how she hadnt heard from herson for a long time but owing to his having spoken once about me shewas emboldened to write and ask me if i knew what had gone of him</s>  hewas pointing his finger at each line of the letter as he read it orrather seemed to translate it from memory with a sad familiarity</s>  nowhe continued in parenthesis you see this kind o got me</s>  i knew he hadgot relatives in kentucky</s>
 i knew that all this trouble had been put inthe paper with his name and mine but this here name of martha jeffcourtat the bottom didnt seem to jibe with it</s>  then i remembered that he hadleft a lot of letters in his trunk in the shanty and i looked em over</s> and i found that his name was tom jeffcourt and that hed been passinunder the name of frisbee all this time</s> perfectly natural and a frequent occurrence interposed the colonelcheerfully</s>  only last year i met an old friend whom well call stidgerof new orleans at the union club frisco</s>  how are you stidger</s>  isaid i havent seen you since we used to meetdriving over the shellroad in 53</s>  excuse me sir said he my name is not stidger itsbrown</s>  i looked him in the eye sir and saw him quiver</s>  then i mustapologize to stidger i said for supposing him capable of changinghis name</s>  he came to me an hour after all in a tremble</s>  for godssake star he saidalways called me stardont go back on mebut you know family affairsanother woman beautiful creature etc</s> etc</s> yes sir perfectly common but a blank mistake</s>  when a man oncefunks his own name hell turn tail on anything</s>  sorry for this manfriezecoat or turncoat or whatevers his dd name but its so</s> the suggestion did not however seem to raise the strangers spiritsor alter his manner</s>  his name was jeffcourt and this here was hismother he went on drearily and you see here she sayspointingto the letter againshes been expecting money from him and it dontcome and shes mighty hard up</s>
 and that gave me an idea</s>  i dont knowhe went on regarding the colonel with gloomy doubt as youll think itwas much i dont know as you wouldnt call it a dd fool idea but igot it all the same</s>  he stopped hesitated and went on</s>  you see thisman frisbee or jeffcourt was my pardner</s>  we were good friends up tothe killing and then he drove me hard</s>  i think i told you he drove

been prettyhard sleddin to do it for i aint rich sometimes ive had to borrowthe money but i reckoned that i was only paying for my share in thishere business of his bein dead and i did it</s> and i understand you that this jeffcourt really had no interest in yourclaim</s> corbin looked at him in dull astonishment</s>  not a cent of course ithought i told you that</s>  but that werent his fault

asneakin yankee hound</s>  i told you he drove me hard</s> the colonel coughed slightly and resumed his jaunty manner</s>  andtheermother was of course grateful and satisfied</s> well nonot exactly</s>  he stopped again and took up his letters oncemore sorted and arranged them as if to play out his unfinished buthopeless hand and drawing out another laid it before the colonel</s>  yousee this mrs</s>  jeffcourt after a time reckoned she ought to have moremoney than i sent her and wrote saying that she had always understoodfrom her son he that never wrote but once a year remember that thisclaim of ours that she never knew of you know was paying much morethan i sent herand she wanted a return of accounts and papers orshed write to some lawyer mighty quick</s>  well i reckoned that allthis was naturally in the line of my trouble and i did manage to scrapetogether fifty dollars more for two months and sent it</s>  but that didntseem to satisfy heras you see</s>  he dealt colonel starbottle anotherletter from his baleful hand with an unchanged face</s>  when i gotthatwell i just up and told her the whole thing</s>  i sent her theaccount of the fight from the newspapers and told her as how her sonwas the frisbee that was my pardner and how he never had a cent in theworldbut how id got that idea to help her and was willing to carryit out as long as i could</s> did you keep a copy of that letter</s>  asked the colonel straitening hismasklike mouth</s> no said corbin moodily</s>  what was the good</s>  i knowd shed got theletterand she didfor that is what she wrote

ofthreatening and chantage as i ever heard of</s> well said corbin dejectedly i dont know</s>  you see she allows thati murdered frisbee to get hold of his claim and that im trying to buyher off and that if i dont come down with twenty thousand dollars onthe nail and notes for the rest shell prosecute me</s>  well mebbe thething looks to her like thatmebbe you know ive got to shoulder thattoo</s>  perhaps its all in the same line</s> colonel starbottle for a moment regarded corbin critically</s>  in spite ofhis chivalrous attitude towards the homicidal faculty the colonelwas not optimistic in regard to the baser pecuniary interests of hisfellowman</s>  it was quite on the cards that his companion might havemurdered his partner to get possession of the claim</s>  it was true thatcorbin had voluntarily assumed an unrecorded and hitherto unknownresponsibility that had never been even suspected and was virtuallyselfimposed</s>  but that might have been the usual one unerring blunder ofcriminal sagacity and forethought</s>  it was equally true that he did notlook or act like a mean murderer but that was nothing</s>  however therewas no evidence of these reflections in the colonels face</s>  rather hesuddenly beamed with an excess of politeness</s>  would youermind mr</s> corbin whilst i am going over those letters again toerstep acrossto my officeanderbring me the copy of woods

execute the commission</s>  as soon as he had left the buildingcolonel starbottle opened the door and mysteriously beckoned thebarkeeper within</s> do you remember anything of the killing of a man

 why the only chance heever had of earning a square meal was when that fellow that was with youjust now took him up and made him his partner</s>  and the only way he couldget rid of him was to kill him</s>  and i didnt think he had it in him</s> rather a queer kind o chapgood deal of hayseed about him</s>  showed upat the inquest so glum and orkerd that if the boys hadnt made up theirminds this

another door</s> it was very extraordinary</s>  it was not strange that i turned back tothe cabin with a chagrin and mortification which for a moment made meentertain the wild idea of saddling chu chu

passed the slide or declivity on thehillside where logs were slipped down into the valley and i inferredthat johnsons business was cutting timber for the mill</s> but youre rather young for all this work i suggested</s> im goin on sixteen she said gravely</s> indeed for the matter of that she might have been any age</s>  her faceon which sunburn took the place of complexion was already hard and set</s> but on a nearer view i was struck with the fact that her eyes whichwere not large were almost indistinguishable from the presence of themost singular eyelashes i had ever seen</s>  intensely black intenselythick and even tangled in their profusion they bristled rather thanfringed her eyelids obliterating everything but the shining blackpupils beneath which were like certain lustrous hairy

others seemed to get the full swing of it andthen the lines rose and fell sadly and monotonously in the darkness</s>  idont know why but i at once got the impression that those motherlesslittle creatures were under a vague belief that their performance wasdevotional and was really filling the place of an evening hymn</s>  a briefand indistinct kind of recitation followed by a dead silence

finally i rose dressed myselfand dragging my stool to the fire took a book from my knapsack and bythe light of a guttering candle which i discovered in a bottle in thecorner of the hearth began to read</s>  presently i fell into a doze</s> how long i slept i could not tell for it seemed to me that a dreamyconsciousness of a dog barking at last forced itself upon me so stronglythat i awoke</s>  the barking appeared to come from behind the cabin in thedirection of the clearing where i had tethered chu chu</s>  i opened thedoor hurriedly ran round the cabin towards the hollow and was almostat

sheneared the end of the extension i distinctly saw the tall figure ofa man moving with a certain diffidence and hesitation that did nothowever suggest any intention of concealment among the trees the girlapparently saw him at the same moment and slightly slackened her pace</s> not more than a dozen feet separated them</s>  he said something that wasinaudible to my earsbut whether from his hesitation or the distancei could not determine</s>  there was no such uncertainty in her replyhowever which was given in her usual curt fashion all right</s>  you cantrapse along home now and turn in</s> she turned the corner of the extension and disappeared</s>  the tall figureof the man wavered hesitatingly for a moment and then vanished also</s> but i was too much excited by curiosity to

i noticed that he cleared the doorway at the top andthe sides only by a hairs breadth</s> by the light of the fire i could see that in spite of his full firstgrowth of beard he was youngeven younger

down myself upon the bed</s> you live near here</s> yes he said a little abstractedly as if listening for someinterruption at ten mile crossing</s> why thats two miles away</s> i reckon</s> then you

noticed them bits o flannin round the chillerns throats</s> i remembered that i had but was uncertain whether it was intended as apreventive of cold or a childs idea of decoration</s>  i nodded</s> thats their trouble</s>  one night when old johnson had been off forthree days to coulterville i was prowling round here and i didnt gitto see no one though there was a light burnin in the shanty all

littlemore or less and adopted in californian slang to express an unknownquantitywas supposed to be replete with deep and convulsing humor</s> my impression is that our extravagant reputation and indeed ourcontinued existence as a club was due solely to the proprietor of therestaurant and two of his waiters and that we were actually runby them</s>  when the suggestion of our meeting regularly

their attendance upon a reputed intellectual company lessdegrading than ministering to the purely animal and silent wants ofthe average customers</s>  it may have been that they were attracted byour general youthfulness</s>  indeed i am inclined to think that theythemselves were much more distinctive and interesting than any membersof the club and it is to introduce them that i venture to recall somuch of its history</s> a few months after our advent at the restaurant one evening joetallant the mining secretary one of our liveliest members wasobserved to be awkward and distrait during dinner forgetting even tooffer the usual gratuity to the italian waiter who handed him his hatalthough he stared at him with an imbecile smile</s>  as we chanced to leavethe restaurant together i was rallying him upon his abstraction whento my surprise he said gravely look here one of two things has got tohappen either we must change our restaurant or im going to resign</s> why</s> well to make

nothing aristocraticabout me but by thunder if i cant eat my dinner and feel i am asgood as the man who waits on me ill resign from the club</s> after endeavoring to point out to him the folly of such a proceeding ifinally suggested that we should take the other members of our club intoour confidence and abide by their decision to which he agreed</s>  but tohis chagrin the others far from participating in his delicacy seemedto enjoy tournellis unexpected wealth with a vicarious satisfactionand increase of dignity as if we were personally responsible forit</s>  although it had been unanimously agreed that we should make noallusions jocose or serious to him nor betray any knowledge of itbefore him i am afraid our attitude at the next dinner was singularlyartificial</s>  a nervous expectancy when he approached us and a certainrestraint during his presence a disposition to check any discussionof shares or strikes in mining lest he should think it personal anavoidance of unnecessary or trifling orders and a singular patiencein awaiting their execution when given a vague hovering betweensympathetic respect and the other extreme of indifferent bluntness inour requests tended i think to make that meal far from exhilarating</s> indeed the unusual depression affected the unfortunate cause of itwho added to our confusion by increased solicitude of service andas iffearful of some fault or having incurred our disfavorby a deprecatoryand exaggerated humility that in our sensitive state seemed like thekeenest irony</s>  at last evidently interpreting our constraint before himinto a desire to be alone he retired to the door of a distant pantrywhence he surveyed us with dark and sorrowful southern eyes</s>  tallantwho in this general embarrassment had been imperfectly served and hadeaten nothing here felt his grievance reach its climax and in a suddenoutbreak of recklessness he roared out hi waiteryou tournelli</s>  hemay he added turning darkly to us buy up enough stock to controlthe board and dismiss me but by thunder if it costs me my place imgoing to have some more chicken</s> it was probably this sensitiveness that kept us from questioning himeven indirectly and perhaps led us into the wildest surmises</s>  he wasacting secretly for a brotherhood or society of waiters he was a silentpartner of his german employer he was a disguised italian stockbrokergaining points from the unguarded conversation of operatingcustomers he was a political refugee with capital he was a fugitivesicilian bandit investing his illgotten gains in california he wasa dissipated young nobleman following some amorous intrigue across theocean and acting as his own figaro or leporello</s>  i think a majority ofus favored the latter hypothesis possibly because we were young andhis appearance gave it color</s>  his thin black mustaches and dark eyeswe felt were tuscan and aristocratic at least they were like thebaritone who played those parts and he ought to know</s>  yet nothing couldbe more exemplary and fastidious than his conduct towards the few ladyfrequenters of the poodle dog restaurant who i regret to say werenot puritanically reserved or conventual in manner</s> but an unexpected circumstance presently changed and divided ourinterest</s>  it was alleged by clay the assistant editor that enteringthe restaurant one evening he saw the back and tails of a coat thatseemed familiar to him halffilling a doorway leading to the restaurantkitchen</s>  it was unmistakably the figure of one of our club memberstheyoung lawyerjack manners</s>  but what was he doing there</s>  while theeditor was still gazing after him he suddenly disappeared as if someone had warned him that he was observed</s>  as he did not reappear whentournelli entered from the kitchen a few moments later the editorcalled him and asked for his fellowmember</s>  to his surprise the italiananswered with every appearance of truthfulness that he had not seenmr</s>  manners at all</s>  the editor was staggered but as he chanced somehours later to meet manners he playfully rallied him on his mysteriousconference with the italian</s>  manners replied briefly that he had had nointerview whatever with tournelli and changed the subject quickly</s>  themysteryas we persisted in believing itwas heightened when anothermember deposed that he had seen tom the western waiter coming frommannerss office</s>  as manners had volunteered no information of this wefelt that we could not without indelicacy ask him if tom was a clientor a messenger from tournelli</s>  the only result was that our club dinnerwas even more constrained than before</s>  not only was tom now investedwith a dark importance but it was evident that the harmony of the clubwas destroyed by these singular secret relations of two of its memberswith their employes</s> it chanced that one morning arriving from a delayed journey i droppedinto the restaurant</s>  it was that slack hour between the lingeringbreakfast and coming luncheon when the tables are partly stripped andunknown doors opened for ventilation reveal the distant kitchen and amingled flavor of cold coffeegrounds and lukewarm soups hangs heavyon the air</s>  to this cheerlessness was added a gusty rain without thatfilmed the panes of the windows and doors and veiled from the passerbythe usual tempting display of snowy cloths and china</s> as i seemed to be the only customer at that hour i selected a table bythe window for distraction</s>  tom had taken my order the other waitersincluding tournelli were absent with the exception of a solitarygerman who in the interlude of perfunctory trifling with the castersgazed at me with that abstracted irresponsibility which one waiterassumes towards anothers customer</s>  even the proprietor had deserted hisdesk at the counter</s>  it seemed to be a favorable opportunity to get someinformation from tom</s> but he anticipated me</s>  when he had dealt a certain number of dishesaround me as if they were cards and he was telling my fortune heleaned over the table and said with interrogating confidencei reckon you call that mr</s>  manners of yours a good lawyer</s> we were very loyal to each other in the club and i replied withyouthful enthusiasm that he was considered one of the most promising atthe bar</s>  and remembering tournelli i added confidently that whoeverengaged him to look after their property interests had secured atreasure</s> but is he good in criminal casesbefore a police court for instance</s> continued tom</s> i believedi dont know on what groundsthat manners was good ininsurance and admiralty law and that he looked upon criminal practiceas low but i answered brisklythough a trifle startledthat as acriminal lawyer he was perfect</s> he could advise a man who had a row hanging on how to steer clear ofbeing up for murdereh</s> i trusted with a desperate attempt at jocosity that neither he nortournelli had been doing anything to require mannerss services in thatway</s> it would be too late then said tom coolly and anybody could tella man what he ought to have done or how to make the best of what hehad done but the smart thing in a lawyer would be to give a chap pointsbeforehand and sorter tell him how far he could go and yet keepinside the law</s>  how he might goad a fellow to draw on him and then plughimeh</s> i looked up quickly</s>  there was nothing in his ordinary goodhumoredbut not very strong face to suggest that he himself was the subject ofthis hypothetical case</s>  if he were speaking for tournelli the italiancertainly was not to be congratulated on his ambassadors prudence andabove all manners was to be warned of the interpretation which might beput upon his counsels and disseminated thus publicly</s>  as i was thinkingwhat to say he moved away but suddenly returned again</s> what made you think tournelli had been up to anything</s>  he askedsharply</s> nothing i answered i only thought you and he being friendsyou mean were both waiters in the same restaurant</s>  well i dont knowhim any better than i know that chap over there pointing to the otherwaiter</s>  hes a greaser or an italian and i reckon goes with hiskind</s> why had we not thought of this before</s>  nothing would be more naturalthan that the rich and imperious tournelli should be exclusive and haveno confidences with his enforced associates</s>  and it was evident that tomhad noticed it and was jealous</s> i suppose hes rather a swell isnt he</s>  i suggested tentatively</s> a faint smile passed over toms face</s>  it was partly cynical and partlysuggestive of that amused toleration of our youthful credulity whichseemed to be a part of that discomposing patronage that everybodyextended to the club</s>  as he said nothing i continued encouraginglybecause a mans a waiter it doesnt follow that hes always been oneor always will be</s> no said tom abstractedly but its about as good as anything elseto lie low and wait on</s>  but here two customers entered and heturned to them leaving me in doubt whether to accept this as a verbalpleasantry or an admission</s>  only one thing seemed plain i had certainlygained no information and only added a darker mystery to his conferencewith manners which i determined i should ask manners to explain</s> i finished my meal in solitude</s>  the rain was still beating drearilyagainst the windows with an occasional accession of impulse that seemedlike human impatience</s>  vague figures under dripping umbrellas thathid their faces as if in premeditated disguise hurried from the mainthoroughfare</s>  a woman in a hooded waterproof like a domino a mexicanin a black serape might have been stage conspirators hastening to arendezvous</s>  the cavernous chill and odor which i had before noted ascoming from some sarcophagus of larder or oven where funeral bakedmeats might have been kept in stock began to oppress me</s>  the hollowand fictitious domesticity of this common board had never before seemedso hopelessly displayed</s>  and tom the waiter his napkin twisted inhis hand and his face turned with a sudden dark abstraction towards thewindow appeared to be really lying low and waiting for somethingoutside his avocation</s> chapter ii</s> the fact that tom did not happen to be on duty at the next club dinnergave me an opportunity to repeat his mysterious remark to manners andto jokingly warn that rising young lawyer against the indiscretion ofvague counsel</s>  manners however only shrugged his shoulders</s>  i dontknow what he meant he said carelessly but since he chooses to talkof his own affairs publicly i dont mind saying that they are neithervery weighty nor very dangerous</s>  its only the old story the usualmatrimonial infidelities that are mixed up with the californianemigration</s>  he leaves the regular wife behindfairly or unfairly icant

the quartermaster said then you didnt do anything forhimgive him any advice eh</s> no for the propertys as much hers as his and he hasnt got adivorce and as its doubtful whether he didnt desert her

invoking the law knownothing about it</s>  we were surprised too although manners was alwaysconvincing us in some cheerful but discomposing way that we were alldaily and hourly in our simplest acts
