lay sermons addresses and reviewsbythomas henry huxley ll</s> d</s>  f</s> r</s> s</s> londonmacmillan and co</s> londonr</s>  clay sons and taylor printersbread street hill</s> 1870a prefatory letter</s> my dear tyndalli should have liked to provide this collection of lay sermonsaddresses and reviews with a dedication and a preface</s>  in the formeri should have asked you to allow me to associate your name with thebook chiefly on the ground that the oldest of the papers in it is agood deal younger than our friendship</s>  in the latter i intended tocomment upon certain criticisms with which some of these essays havebeen met</s> but on turning the matter over in my mind i began to fear that aformal dedication at the beginning of such a volume would look like agrand lodge in front of a set of cottages while a complete defence ofany of my old papers would simply amount to writing a new onea labourfor which i am at present by no means fit</s> the book must go forth therefore without any better substitute foreither dedication or preface than this letter before concluding whichit is necessary for me to notify you and any other reader of two orthree matters</s> the first is that the oldest essay of the whole that on theeducational value of the natural history sciences contains a view ofthe nature of the differences between living and notliving bodies outof which i have long since grown</s> secondly in the same paper there is a statement concerning the methodof the mathematical sciences which repeated and expanded elsewherebrought upon me during the meeting of the british association atexeter the artillery of our eminent friend professor sylvester</s> no one knows better than you do how readily i should defer to theopinion of so great a mathematician if the question at issue werereally as he seems to think it is a mathematical one</s>  but i submitthat the dictum of a mathematical athlete upon a difficult problem whichmathematics offers to philosophy has no more special weight than theverdict of that great pedestrian captain barclay would have had insettling a disputed point in the physiology of locomotion</s> the genius which sighs for new worlds to conquer beyond that surprisingregion in which geometry algebra and the theory of numbers melt intoone another like sunset tints or the colours of a dying dolphin maybe of comparatively little service in the cold domain mostly lighted bythe moon some say of philosophy</s>  and the more i think of it the moredoes our friend seem to me to fall into the position of one of thoseverstndige leute about whom he makes so apt a quotation from goethe</s> surely he has not duly considered two points</s>  the first that i am in noway answerable for the origination of the doctrine he criticises andthe second that if we are to employ the terms observation inductionand experiment in the sense in which he uses them logic is as much anobservational inductive and experimental science as mathematics andthat i confess appears to me to be a reductio ad absurdum of hisargument</s> thirdly the essay on the physical basis of life was intended tocontain a plain and untechnical statement of one of the great tendenciesof modern biological thought accompanied by a protest from thephilosophical side against what is commonly called materialism</s>  theresult of my wellmeant efforts i find to be that i am generallycredited with having invented protoplasm in the interests ofmaterialism</s>  my unlucky lay sermon has been attacked bymicroscopists ignorant alike of biology and philosophy byphilosophers not very learned in either biology or microscopy byclergymen of several denominations and by some few writers who havetaken the trouble to understand the subject</s>  i trust that these lastwill believe that i leave the essay unaltered from no want of respectfulattention to all they have said</s> fourthly i wish to refer all who are interested in the topics discussedin my address on geological reform to the reply with which sirwilliam thomson has honoured me</s> and lastly let me say that i reprint the review of the origin ofspecies simply because it has been cited as mine by a late president ofthe geological society</s>  if you find its phraseology in some places tobe more vigorous than seems needful recollect that it was written inthe heat of our first battles over the novum organon of biology that wewere all ten years younger in those days and last but not least thatit was not published until it had been submitted to the revision of afriend for whose judgment i had

and subsequently published in macmillans magazine       351lay sermons addresses and reviews</s> i</s> on the advisableness of improving natural knowledge</s> this time two hundred years agoin the beginning of january1666those of our forefathers who inhabited this great and ancientcity took breath between the shocks of two fearful calamities one notquite past although its fury had abated the other to come</s> within a few yards of the very spot on which we are assembled so thetradition runs that painful and deadly malady the plague appeared inthe latter months of 1664 and though no new visitor smote the peopleof england and especially of her capital with a violence unknownbefore in the course of the following year</s>  the hand of a master haspictured what happened in those dismal months and in that truest offictions the history of the plague year defoe shows death withevery accompaniment of pain and terror stalking through the narrowstreets of old london and changing their busy hum into a silence brokenonly by the wailing of the mourners of fifty thousand dead by the wofuldenunciations and mad prayers of fanatics and by the madder yells ofdespairing profligates</s> but about this time in 1666 the deathrate had sunk to nearly itsordinary amount a case of plague occurred only here and there and thericher citizens who had flown from the pest had returned to theirdwellings</s>  the remnant of the people began to toil at the accustomedround of duty or of pleasure and the stream of city life bid fair toflow back along its old bed with renewed and uninterrupted vigour</s> the newly kindled hope was deceitful</s>  the great plague indeed returnedno more but what it had done for the londoners the great fire whichbroke out in the autumn of 1666 did for london and in september ofthat year a heap of ashes and the indestructible energy of the peoplewere all that remained of the glory of fivesixths of the city withinthe walls</s> our forefathers had their own ways of accounting for each of thesecalamities</s>  they submitted to the plague in humility and in penitencefor they believed it to be the judgment of god</s>  but towards the firethey were furiously indignant interpreting it as the effect of themalice of manas the work of the republicans or of the papistsaccording as their prepossessions ran in favour of loyalty or ofpuritanism</s> it would i fancy have fared but ill with one who standing where i nowstand in what was then a thickly peopled and fashionable part oflondon should have broached to our ancestors the doctrine which i nowpropound to youthat all their hypotheses were alike wrong that theplague was no more in their sense divine judgment than the fire wasthe work of any political or of any religious sect but that they werethemselves the authors of both plague and fire and that they must lookto themselves to prevent the recurrence of calamities to all appearanceso peculiarly beyond the reach of human controlso evidently the resultof the wrath of god or of the craft and subtlety of an enemy</s> and one may picture to oneself how harmoniously the holy cursing of thepuritan of that day would have chimed in with the unholy cursing and thecrackling wit of the rochesters and sedleys and with the revilings ofthe political fanatics if my imaginary plain dealer had gone on to saythat if the return of such misfortunes were ever rendered impossibleit would not be in virtue of the victory of the faith of laud or ofthat of milton and as little by the triumph of republicanism as bythat of monarchy</s>  but that the one thing needful for compassing this endwas that the people of england should second the efforts of aninsignificant corporation the establishment of which a few yearsbefore the epoch of the great plague and the great fire had been aslittle noticed as they were conspicuous</s> some twenty years before the outbreak of the plague a few calm andthoughtful students banded themselves together for the purpose as theyphrased it of improving natural knowledge</s>  the ends they proposed toattain cannot be stated more clearly than in the words of one of thefounders of the organizationour business was precluding matters of theology and state affairs todiscourse and consider of philosophical enquiries and such as relatedthereuntoas physick anatomy geometry astronomy navigationstaticks magneticks chymicks mechanicks and natural experimentswith the state of these studies and their cultivation at home andabroad</s>  we then discoursed of the circulation of the blood the valvesin the veins the ven lacte the lymphatic vessels the copernicanhypothesis the nature of comets and new stars the satellites ofjupiter the oval shape as it then appeared of saturn the spots onthe sun and its turning on its own axis the inequalities andselenography of the moon the several phases of venus and mercury theimprovement of telescopes and grinding of glasses for that purpose theweight of air the possibility or impossibility of vacuities andnatures abhorrence thereof the torricellian experiment in quicksilverthe descent of heavy bodies and the degree of acceleration therein withdivers other things of like nature some of which were then but newdiscoveries and others not so generally known and embraced as now theyare with other things appertaining to what hath been called the newphilosophy which from the times of galileo at florence and sirfrancis bacon lord verulam in england hath been much cultivated initaly france germany and other parts abroad as well as with us inengland</s> the learned dr</s>  wallis writing in 1696 narrates in these words whathappened half a century before or about 1645</s>  the associates met atoxford in the rooms of dr</s>  wilkins who was destined to become abishop and subsequently coming together in london they attracted thenotice of the king</s>  and it is a strange evidence of the taste forknowledge which the most obviously worthless of the stuarts shared withhis father and grandfather that charles the second was not contentwith saying witty things about his philosophers but did wise thingswith regard to them</s>  for he not only bestowed upon them such attentionas he could spare from his poodles and his mistresses but being in hisusual state of impecuniosity begged for them of the duke of ormondand that step being without effect gave them chelsea college acharter and a mace crowning his favours in the best way they could becrowned by burdening them no further with royal patronage or stateinterference</s> thus it was that the halfdozen young men studious of the newphilosophy who met in one anothers lodgings in oxford or in londonin the middle of the seventeenth century grew in numerical and in realstrength until in its latter part the royal society for theimprovement of natural knowledge had already become famous and hadacquired a claim upon the veneration of englishmen which it has eversince retained as the principal focus of scientific activity in ourislands and the chief champion of the cause it was formed to support</s> it was by the aid of the royal society that newton published hisprincipia</s>  if all the books in the world except the philosophicaltransactions were destroyed it is safe to say that the foundations ofphysical science would remain unshaken and that the vast intellectualprogress of the last two centuries would be largely thoughincompletely recorded</s>  nor have any signs of halting or of decrepitudemanifested themselves in our own times</s>  as in dr</s>  walliss days so inthese our business is precluding theology and state affairs todiscourse and consider of philosophical enquiries</s>  but ourmathematick is one which newton would have to go to school to learnour staticks mechanicks magneticks chymicks and naturalexperiments constitute a mass of physical and chemical knowledge aglimpse at which would compensate galileo for the doings of a score ofinquisitorial cardinals our physick and anatomy have embraced suchinfinite varieties of being have laid open such new worlds in time andspace have grappled not unsuccessfully with such complex problemsthat the eyes of vesalius and of harvey might be dazzled by the sight ofthe tree that has grown out of their grain of mustard seed</s> the fact is perhaps rather too much than too little forced upon onesnotice nowadays that all this marvellous intellectual growth has a noless wonderful expression in practical life and that in this respectif in no other the movement symbolized by the progress of the royalsociety stands without a parallel in the history of mankind</s> a series of volumes as bulky as the transactions of the royal societymight possibly be filled with the subtle speculations of the schoolmennot improbably the obtaining a mastery over the products of medivalthought might necessitate an even greater expenditure of time and ofenergy than the acquirement of the new philosophy but though suchwork engrossed the best intellects of europe for a longer time than haselapsed since the great fire its effects were writ in water so faras our social state is concerned</s> on the other hand if the noble first president of the royal societycould revisit the upper air and once more gladden his eyes with a sightof the familiar mace he would find himself in the midst of a materialcivilization more different from that of his day than that of theseventeenth was from that of the first century</s>  and if lordbrounckers native sagacity had not deserted his ghost he would need nolong reflection to discover that all these great ships these railwaysthese telegraphs these factories these printing presses without whichthe whole fabric of modern english society would collapse into a mass ofstagnant and starving pauperismthat all these pillars of our stateare but the ripples and the bubbles upon the surface of that greatspiritual stream the springs of which only he and his fellows wereprivileged to see and seeing to recognise as that which it behovedthem above all things to keep pure and undefiled</s> it may not be too great a flight of imagination to conceive our noblerevenant not forgetful of the great troubles of his own day andanxious to know how often london had been burned down since his timeand how often the plague had carried off its thousands</s>  he would have tolearn that although london contains tenfold the inflammable matter thatit did in 1666 though not content with filling our rooms with woodworkand light draperies we must needs lead inflammable and explosive gasesinto every corner of our streets and houses we never allow even astreet to burn down</s>  and if he asked how this had come about we shouldhave to explain that the improvement of natural knowledge has furnishedus with dozens of machines for throwing water upon fires anyone ofwhich would have furnished the ingenious mr</s>  hooke the first curatorand experimenter of the royal society with ample materials fordiscourse before half a dozen meetings of that body and that to saytruth except for the progress of natural knowledge we should not havebeen able to make even the tools by which these machines areconstructed</s>  and further it would be necessary to add that althoughsevere fires sometimes occur and inflict great damage the loss is verygenerally compensated by societies the operations of which have beenrendered possible only by the progress of natural knowledge in thedirection of mathematics and the accumulation of wealth in virtue ofother natural knowledge</s> but the plague</s>  my lord brounckers observation would not i fear leadhim to think that englishmen of the nineteenth century are purer inlife or more fervent in religious faith than the generation whichcould produce a boyle an evelyn and a milton</s>  he might find the mud ofsociety at the bottom instead of at the top but i fear that the sumtotal would be as deserving of swift judgment as at the time of therestoration</s>  and it would be our duty to explain once more and thistime not without shame that we have no reason to believe that it is theimprovement of our faith nor that of our morals which keeps the plaguefrom our city but again that it is the improvement of our naturalknowledge</s> we have learned that pestilences will only take up their abode amongthose who have prepared unswept and ungarnished residences for them</s> their cities must have narrow unwatered streets foul with accumulatedgarbage</s>  their houses must be illdrained illlighted illventilated</s> their subjects must be illwashed illfed illclothed</s>  the london of1665 was such a city</s>  the cities of the east where plague has anenduring dwelling are such cities</s>  we in later times have learnedsomewhat of nature and partly obey her</s>  because of this partialimprovement of our natural knowledge and of that fractional obediencewe have no plague because that knowledge is still very imperfect andthat obedience yet incomplete typhus is our companion and cholera ourvisitor</s>  but it is not presumptuous to express the belief that when ourknowledge is more complete and our obedience the expression of ourknowledge london will count her centuries of freedom from typhus andcholera as she now gratefully reckons her two hundred years ofignorance of that plague which swooped upon her thrice in the first halfof the seventeenth century</s> surely there is nothing in these explanations which is not fully borneout by the facts</s>  surely the principles involved in them are nowadmitted among the fixed beliefs of all thinking men</s>  surely it is truethat our countrymen are less subject to fire famine pestilence andall the evils which result from a want of command over and dueanticipation of the course of nature than were the countrymen ofmilton and health wealth and wellbeing are more abundant with usthan with them</s>  but no less certainly is the difference due to theimprovement of our knowledge of nature and the extent to which thatimproved knowledge has been incorporated with the household words ofmen and has supplied the springs of their daily actions</s> granting for a moment then the truth of that which the depreciators ofnatural knowledge are so fond of urging that its improvement can onlyadd to the resources of our material civilization admitting it to bepossible that the founders of the royal society themselves looked for noother reward than this i cannot confess that i was guilty ofexaggeration when i hinted that to him who had the gift ofdistinguishing between prominent events and important events the originof a combined effort on the part of mankind to improve natural knowledgemight have loomed larger than the plague and have outshone the glare ofthe fire as a something fraught with a wealth of beneficence tomankind in comparison with which the damage done by those ghastly evilswould shrink into insignificance</s> it is very certain that for every victim slain by the plague hundredsof mankind exist and find a fair share of happiness in the world by theaid of the spinning jenny</s>  and the great fire at its worst could nothave burned the supply of coal the daily working of which in thebowels of the earth made possible by the steam pump gives rise to anamount of wealth to which the millions lost in old london are but as anold song</s> but spinning jenny and steam pump are after all but toys possessingan accidental value and natural knowledge creates multitudes of moresubtle contrivances the praises of which do not happen to be sungbecause they are not directly convertible into instruments for creatingwealth</s>  when i contemplate natural knowledge squandering such giftsamong men the only appropriate comparison i can find for her is toliken her to such a peasant woman as one sees in the alps striding everupward heavily burdened and with mind bent only on her home but yetwithout effort and without thought knitting for her children</s>  nowstockings are good and comfortable things and the children willundoubtedly be much the better for them but surely it would beshortsighted to say the least of it to depreciate this toiling motheras a mere stockingmachinea mere provider of physical comforts</s> however there are blind leaders of the blind and not a few of themwho take this view of natural knowledge and can see nothing in thebountiful mother of humanity but a sort of comfortgrinding machine</s> according to them the improvement of natural knowledge always has beenand always must be synonymous with no more than the improvement of thematerial resources and the increase of the gratifications of men</s> natural knowledge is in their eyes no real mother of mankind bringingthem up with kindness and if need be with sternness in the way theyshould go and instructing them in all things needful for their welfarebut a sort of fairy godmother ready to furnish her pets with shoes ofswiftness swords of sharpness and omnipotent aladdins lamps so thatthey may have telegraphs to saturn and see the other side of the moonand thank god they are better than their benighted ancestors</s> if this talk were true i for one should not greatly care to toil inthe service of natural knowledge</s>  i think i would just as soon bequietly chipping my own flint axe after the manner of my forefathers afew thousand years back as be troubled with the endless malady ofthought which now infests us all for such reward</s>  but i venture to saythat such views are contrary alike to reason and to fact</s>  those whodiscourse in such fashion seem to me to be so intent upon trying to seewhat is above nature or what is behind her that they are blind to whatstares them in the face in her</s> i should not venture to speak thus strongly if my justification were notto be found in the simplest and most obvious factsif it needed morethan an appeal to the most notorious truths to justify my assertionthat the improvement of natural knowledge whatever direction it hastaken and however low the aims of those who may have commenced ithasnot only conferred practical benefits on men but in so doing haseffected a revolution in their conceptions of the universe and ofthemselves and has profoundly altered their modes of thinking and theirviews of right and wrong</s>  i say that natural knowledge seeking tosatisfy natural wants has found the ideas which can alone stillspiritual cravings</s>  i say that natural knowledge in desiring toascertain the laws of comfort has been driven to discover those ofconduct and to lay the foundations of a new morality</s> let us take these points separately and first what great ideas hasnatural knowledge introduced into mens minds</s> i cannot but think that the foundations of all natural knowledge werelaid when the reason of man first came face to face with the facts ofnature when the savage first learned that the fingers of one hand arefewer than those of both that it is shorter to cross a stream than tohead it that a stone stops where it is unless it be moved and that itdrops from the hand which lets it go that light and heat come and gowith the sun that sticks burn away in a fire that plants and animalsgrow and die that if he struck his fellowsavage a blow he would makehim angry and perhaps get a blow in return while if he offered him afruit he would please him and perhaps receive a fish in exchange</s>  whenmen had acquired this much knowledge the outlines rude though theywere of mathematics of physics of chemistry of biology of moraleconomical and political science were sketched</s>  nor did the germ ofreligion fail when science began to bud</s>  listen to words which thoughnew are yet three thousand years old  </s> </s> </s> when in heaven the stars about the moon  look beautiful when all the winds are laid  and every height comes out and jutting peak  and valley and the immeasurable heavens  break open to their highest and all the stars  shine and the shepherd gladdens in his heart</s> 1if the halfsavage greek could share our feelings thus far it isirrational to doubt that he went further to find as we do that uponthat brief gladness there follows a certain sorrowthe little light ofawakened human intelligence shines so mere a spark amidst the abyss ofthe unknown and unknowable seems so insufficient to do more thanilluminate the imperfections that cannot be remedied the aspirationsthat cannot be realized of mans own nature</s>  but in this sadness thisconsciousness of the limitation of man this sense of an open secretwhich he cannot penetrate lies the essence of all religion and theattempt to embody it in the forms furnished by the intellect is theorigin of the higher theologies</s> thus it seems impossible to imagine but that the foundations of allknowledgesecular or sacredwere laid when intelligence dawned thoughthe superstructure remained for long ages so slight and feeble as to becompatible with the existence of almost any general view respecting themode of governance of the universe</s>  no doubt from the first there werecertain phenomena which to the rudest mind presented a constancy ofoccurrence and suggested that a fixed order ruled at any rate amongthem</s>  i doubt if the grossest of fetish worshippers ever imagined that astone must have a god within it to make it fall or that a fruit had agod within it to make it taste sweet</s>  with regard to such matters asthese it is hardly questionable that mankind from the first tookstrictly positive and scientific views</s> but with respect to all the less familiar occurrences which presentthemselves uncultured man no doubt has always taken himself as thestandard of comparison as the centre and measure of the world norcould he well avoid doing so</s>  and finding that his apparently uncausedwill has a powerful effect in giving rise to many occurrences henaturally enough ascribed other and greater events to other and greatervolitions and came to look upon the world and all that therein is asthe product of the volitions of persons like himself but stronger andcapable of being appeased or angered as he himself might be soothed orirritated</s>  through such conceptions of the plan and working of theuniverse all mankind have passed or are passing</s>  and we may nowconsider what has been the effect of the improvement of naturalknowledge on the views of men who have reached this stage and who havebegun to cultivate natural knowledge with no desire but that ofincreasing gods honour and bettering mans estate</s> for example what could seem wiser from a mere material point of viewmore innocent from a theological one to an ancient people than thatthey should learn the exact succession of the seasons as warnings fortheir husbandmen or the position of the stars as guides to their rudenavigators</s>  but what has grown out of this search for natural knowledgeof so merely useful a character</s>  you all know the reply</s> astronomywhich of all sciences has filled mens minds with generalideas of a character most foreign to their daily experience and hasmore than any other rendered it impossible for them to accept thebeliefs of their fathers</s>  astronomywhich tells them that this so vastand seemingly solid earth is but an atom among atoms whirling no manknows whither through illimitable space which demonstrates that whatwe call the peaceful heaven above us is but that space filled by aninfinitely subtle matter whose particles are seething and surging likethe waves of an angry sea which opens up to us infinite regions wherenothing is known or ever seems to have been known but matter andforce operating according to rigid rules which leads us to contemplatephenomena the very nature of which demonstrates that they must have hada beginning and that they must have an end but the very nature ofwhich also proves that the beginning was to our conceptions of timeinfinitely remote and that the end is as immeasurably distant</s> but it is not alone those who pursue astronomy who ask for bread andreceive ideas</s>  what more harmless than the attempt to lift anddistribute water by pumping it what more absolutely and grosslyutilitarian</s>  but out of pumps grew the discussions about naturesabhorrence of a vacuum and then it was discovered that nature does notabhor a vacuum but that air has weight and that notion paved the wayfor the doctrine that all matter has weight and that the force whichproduces weight is coextensive with the universein short to thetheory of universal gravitation and endless force</s>  while learning how tohandle gases led to the discovery of oxygen and to modern chemistryand to the notion of the indestructibility of matter</s> again what simpler or more absolutely practical than the attempt tokeep the axle of a wheel from heating when the wheel turns round veryfast</s>  how useful for carters and gig drivers to know something aboutthis and how good were it if any ingenious person would find out thecause of such phenomena and thence educe a general remedy for them</s> such an ingenious person was count rumford and he and his successorshave landed us in the theory of the persistence or indestructibilityof force</s>  and in the infinitely minute as in the infinitely great theseekers after natural knowledge of the kinds called physical andchemical have everywhere found a definite order and succession ofevents which seem never to be infringed</s> and how has it fared with physick and anatomy</s>  have the anatomist thephysiologist or the physician whose business it has been to devotethemselves assiduously to that eminently practical and direct end thealleviation of the sufferings of mankindhave they been able toconfine their vision more absolutely to the strictly useful</s>  i fear theyare worst offenders of all</s>  for if the astronomer has set before us theinfinite magnitude of space and the practical eternity of the durationof the universe if the physical and chemical philosophers havedemonstrated the infinite minuteness of its constituent parts and thepractical eternity of matter and of force and if both have alikeproclaimed the universality of a definite and predicable order andsuccession of events the workers in biology have not only accepted allthese but have added more startling theses of their own</s>  for as theastronomers discover in the earth no centre of the universe but aneccentric speck so the naturalists find man to be no centre of theliving world but one amidst endless modifications of life and as theastronomer observes the mark of practically endless time set upon thearrangements of the solar system so the student of life finds therecords of ancient forms of existence peopling the world for ageswhich in relation to human experience are infinite</s> furthermore the physiologist finds life to be as dependent for itsmanifestation on particular molecular arrangements as any physical orchemical phenomenon and wherever he extends his researches fixedorder and unchanging causation reveal themselves as plainly as in therest of nature</s> nor can i find that any other fate has awaited the germ of religion</s> arising like all other kinds of knowledge out of the action andinteraction of mans mind with that which is not mans mind it hastaken the intellectual coverings of fetishism or polytheism of theismor atheism of superstition or rationalism</s>  with these and theirrelative merits and demerits i have nothing to do but this it isneedful for my purpose to say that if the religion of the presentdiffers from that of the past it is because the theology of the presenthas become more scientific than that of the past because it has notonly renounced idols of wood and idols of stone but begins to see thenecessity of breaking in pieces the idols built up of books andtraditions and finespun ecclesiastical cobwebs and of cherishing thenoblest and most human of mans emotions by worship for the most partof the silent sort at the altar of the unknown and unknowable</s> such are a few of the new conceptions implanted in our minds by theimprovement of natural knowledge</s>  men have acquired the ideas of thepractically infinite extent of the universe and of its practicaleternity they are familiar with the conception that our earth is but aninfinitesimal fragment of that part of the universe which can be seenand that nevertheless its duration is as compared with our standardsof time infinite</s>  they have further acquired the idea that man is butone of innumerable forms of life now existing in the globe and that thepresent existences are but the last of an immeasurable series ofpredecessors</s>  moreover every step they have made in natural knowledgehas tended to extend and rivet in their minds the conception of adefinite order of the universewhich is embodied in what are called byan unhappy metaphor the laws of natureand to narrow the range andloosen the force of mens belief in spontaneity or in changes otherthan such as arise out of that definite order itself</s> whether these ideas are well or ill founded is not the question</s>  no onecan deny that they exist and have been the inevitable outgrowth of theimprovement of natural knowledge</s>  and if so it cannot be doubted thatthey are changing the form of mens most cherished and most importantconvictions</s> and as regards the second pointthe extent to which the improvement ofnatural knowledge has remodelled and altered what may be termed theintellectual ethics of menwhat are among the moral convictions mostfondly held by barbarous and semibarbarous people</s> they are the convictions that authority is the soundest basis of beliefthat merit attaches to a readiness to believe that the doubtingdisposition is a bad one and scepticism a sin that when good authorityhas pronounced what is to be believed and faith has accepted it reasonhas no further duty</s>  there are many excellent persons who yet hold bythese principles and it is not my present business or intention todiscuss their views</s>  all i wish to bring clearly before your minds isthe unquestionable fact that the improvement of natural knowledge iseffected by methods which directly give the lie to all theseconvictions and assume the exact reverse of each to be true</s> the improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledgeauthority as such</s>  for him scepticism is the highest of duties blindfaith the one unpardonable sin</s>  and it cannot be otherwise for everygreat advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejectionof authority the cherishing of the keenest scepticism the annihilationof the spirit of blind faith and the most ardent votary of scienceholds his firmest convictions not because the men he most venerateshold them not because their verity is testified by portents andwonders but because his experience teaches him that whenever he choosesto bring these convictions into contact with their primary sourcenaturewhenever he thinks fit to test them by appealing to experimentand to observationnature will confirm them</s>  the man of science haslearned to believe in justification not by faith but by verification</s> thus without for a moment pretending to despise the practical resultsof the improvement of natural knowledge and its beneficial influence onmaterial civilization it must i think be admitted that the greatideas some of which i have indicated and the ethical spirit which ihave endeavoured to sketch in the few moments which remained at mydisposal constitute the real and permanent significance of naturalknowledge</s> if these ideas be destined as i believe they are to be more and morefirmly established as the world grows older if that spirit be fated asi believe it is to extend

interest nowdares to say that education is a bad thing</s>  if any representative of theonce large and powerful party which in former days proclaimed thisopinion still exists in a semifossil state he keeps his thoughts tohimself</s>  in fact there is a chorus of voices almost distressing intheir harmony raised in favour of the doctrine that education is thegreat panacea for human troubles and that if the country is notshortly to go to the dogs everybody must be educated</s> the politicians tell us you must educate the masses because they aregoing to be masters</s>  the clergy join in the cry

trades unionism is the doctrine of the squiresapplied by the artisans</s>  why should we be worse off under one rgimethan under the other</s> again this sceptical minority asks the clergy to think whether it isreally want of education which keeps the masses away from theirministrationswhether the most completely educated men are not as opento reproach on this score as the workmen and whether perchance thismay not indicate that it is not education which lies at the bottom ofthe matter</s> once more these people whom there is no pleasing venture to doubtwhether the glory which rests upon being able to undersell all the restof the world is a very safe kind of glorywhether we may not purchaseit too dear especially if we allow education which ought to bedirected to the making of men to be diverted into a process ofmanufacturing human tools wonderfully adroit in the exercise of sometechnical industry but good for nothing else</s> and finally these people inquire whether it is the

the contrary preserve a touching faith in the efficacy ofacts of parliament and i believe we should have compulsory education inthe course of next session if there were the least probability thathalf

this mightygame</s>  in other words education is the instruction of the intellect inthe laws of nature under which name i include not merely things andtheir forces but men and their ways and the fashioning of theaffections and of the will into an earnest and loving desire to move inharmony with those laws</s>  for me education means neither more nor lessthan this</s>  anything which professes to call itself education must betried by this standard and if it fails to stand the test i will notcall it education whatever may be the force of authority or ofnumbers upon the other side</s> it is

complete andthorough scientific culture ought to be introduced into all schools</s>  bythis however i do not mean that every schoolboy should be taughteverything in science</s>  that would be a very absurd thing to conceiveand a very mischievous thing to attempt</s>  what i mean is that no boy norgirl should leave school without possessing a grasp of the generalcharacter of science and without having been disciplined more or lessin the methods of all sciences so that when turned into the world tomake their own way they shall be prepared to face scientific problemsnot by knowing at once the conditions of every problem or by being ableat once to solve it but by being familiar with the general current ofscientific thought and by being able to apply the methods of science inthe proper way

does this animal live and what is the use of thatplant</s>  and if not snubbed and stunted by being told not to ask foolishquestions there is no limit to the intellectual craving of a youngchild nor any bounds to the slow but solid accretion of knowledge anddevelopment of the thinking faculty in this way</s>  to all such questionsanswers which are necessarily incomplete though true as far as they gomay be given by any teacher whose ideas represent real knowledge and notmere book learning and a panoramic view of nature accompanied by astrong infusion of the scientific habit of mind may thus be placedwithin the reach of every child of nine or ten</s> after this preliminary opening of the eyes to the great spectacle of thedaily progress of nature as the reasoning faculties of the child growand he becomes familiar with the use of the tools of knowledgereadingwriting and elementary mathematicshe should pass on to what is inthe more strict sense physical science</s>  now there are two

to go no further justnow and i believe that such instruction would make an excellentintroduction to that preparatory scientific training which as i haveindicated is so essential for the successful pursuit of our mostimportant professions</s>  but this modicum of instruction must be so givenas to ensure real knowledge and practical discipline</s>  if scientificeducation is to be dealt with as mere bookwork it will be better not toattempt it but to stick to the latin grammar which makes no pretenceto be anything but bookwork</s> if the great benefits of scientific training are sought it is essentialthat such training should be real that is to say that the mind of thescholar should be brought into direct relation with fact that he shouldnot merely be told a thing but made to see by the use of his ownintellect and ability that the thing is so and no otherwise</s>  the greatpeculiarity of scientific training that in virtue of which it cannot bereplaced by any other discipline whatsoever is this bringing of themind directly into contact with fact and practising the intellect inthe completest form of induction that is to say in drawing conclusionsfrom particular facts made known by immediate observation of nature</s> the other studies which enter into ordinary education do not disciplinethe mind in this way</s>  mathematical training is almost purely deductive</s> the mathematician starts with a few simple propositions the proof ofwhich is so obvious that they are called selfevident and the rest ofhis work consists of subtle deductions from them</s>  the teaching oflanguages at any rate as ordinarily practised is of the same generalnatureauthority and tradition furnish the data and the mentaloperations of the scholar are deductive</s> again if history be the subject of study the facts are still takenupon the evidence of tradition and authority</s>  you cannot make a boy seethe battle of thermopyl for himself or know of his own knowledgethat cromwell once ruled england</s>  there is no getting into directcontact with natural fact by this road there is no dispensing withauthority but rather a resting upon it</s> in all these respects science differs from other educationaldiscipline and prepares the scholar for common life</s>  what have we to doin everyday life</s>  most of the business which demands our attention ismatter of fact which needs in the first place to be accuratelyobserved or apprehended in the second to be interpreted by inductiveand deductive reasonings which are altogether similar in their natureto those employed in science</s>  in the one case as in the other whateveris taken for granted is so taken at ones own peril fact and reasonare the ultimate arbiters and patience and honesty are the greathelpers out of difficulty</s> but if scientific training is to yield its most eminent results itmust i repeat be made practical</s>  that is to say in explaining to achild the general phenomena of nature you must as far as possiblegive reality to your teaching by objectlessons in teaching him botanyhe must handle the plants and dissect the flowers for himself inteaching him physics and chemistry you must not be solicitous to fillhim with information but you must be careful that what he learns heknows of his own knowledge</s>  dont be satisfied with telling him that amagnet attracts iron</s>  let him see that it does let him feel the pull ofthe one upon the other for himself</s>  and especially tell him that it ishis duty to doubt until he is compelled by the absolute authority ofnature to believe that which is written in books</s>  pursue thisdiscipline carefully and conscientiously and you may make sure thathowever scanty may be the measure of information which you have pouredinto the boys mind you have created an intellectual habit of pricelessvalue in practical life</s> one is constantly asked when should this scientific education becommenced</s>  i should say with the dawn of intelligence</s>  as i have alreadysaid a child seeks for information about matters of physical science assoon as it begins to talk</s>  the first teaching it wants is anobjectlesson of one sort or another and as soon as it is fit forsystematic instruction of any kind it is fit for a modicum of science</s> people talk of the difficulty of teaching young children such mattersand in the same breath insist upon their learning their catechismwhich contains propositions far harder to comprehend than anything inthe educational course i have proposed</s>  again i am incessantly toldthat we who advocate the introduction of science into schools make noallowance for the stupidity of the average boy or girl but in mybelief that stupidity in nine cases out of ten fit non nasciturand is developed by a long process of parental and pedagogic repressionof the natural intellectual appetites accompanied by a persistentattempt to create artificial ones for food which is not only tastelessbut essentially indigestible</s> those who urge the difficulty of instructing young people in science areapt to forget another very important condition of successimportant inall kinds of teaching but most essential i am disposed to think whenthe scholars are very young</s>  this condition is that the teacher shouldhimself really and practically know his subject</s>  if he does he will beable to speak of it in the easy language and with the completeness ofconviction with which he talks of any ordinary everyday matter</s>  if hedoes not he will be afraid to wander beyond the limits of the technicalphraseology which he has got up and a dead dogmatism which oppressesor raises opposition will take the place of the lively confidence bornof personal conviction which cheers and encourages the eminentlysympathetic mind of childhood</s> i have already hinted that such scientific training as we seek for maybe given without making any extravagant claim upon the time now devotedto education</s>  we ask only for a most favoured nation clause in ourtreaty with the schoolmaster we demand no more than that science shallhave as much time given to it as any other single subjectsay fourhours a week in each class of an ordinary school</s> for the present i think men of science would be well content with suchan arrangement as this but speaking for myself i do not pretend tobelieve that such an arrangement can be or will be permanent</s>  in thesetimes the educational tree seems to me to have its roots in the air itsleaves and flowers in the ground and i confess i should very muchlike to turn it upside down so that its roots might be solidly embeddedamong the facts of nature and draw thence a sound nutriment for thefoliage and fruit of literature and of art</s>  no educational system canhave a claim to permanence unless it recognises the truth thateducation has two great ends to which everything else must besubordinated</s>  the one of these is to increase knowledge the other is todevelop the love of right and the hatred of wrong</s> with wisdom and uprightness a nation can make its way worthily andbeauty will follow in the footsteps of the two even if she be notspecially invited while there is perhaps no sight in the whole worldmore saddening and revolting than is offered by men sunk in ignorance ofeverything but what other men have written seemingly devoid of moralbelief or guidance but with the sense of beauty so keen and the powerof expression so cultivated that their sensual caterwauling may bealmost mistaken for the music of the spheres</s> at present education is almost entirely devoted to the cultivation ofthe power of expression and of the sense of literary beauty</s>  the matterof having anything to say beyond a hash of other peoples opinions orof possessing any criterion of beauty so that we may distinguishbetween the godlike and the devilish is left aside as of no moment</s>  ithink i do not err in saying that if science were made the foundation ofeducation instead of being at most stuck on as cornice to theedifice this state of things could not exist</s> in advocating the introduction of physical science as a leading elementin education i by no means refer only to the higher schools</s>  on thecontrary i believe that such a change is even more imperatively calledfor in those primary schools in which the children of the poor areexpected to turn to the best account the little time they can devote tothe acquisition of knowledge</s>  a great step in this direction has alreadybeen made by the establishment of scienceclasses under the departmentof science and arta measure which came into existence unnoticed butwhich will i believe turn out to be of more importance to the welfareof the people than many political changes over which the noise ofbattle has rent the air</s> under the regulations to which i refer a schoolmaster can set up aclass in one or more branches of science his pupils will be examinedand the state will pay him at a certain rate for all who succeed inpassing</s>  i have acted as an examiner under this system from thebeginning of its establishment and this year i expect to have not fewerthan a couple of thousand sets of answers to questions in physiologymainly from young people of the artisan class who have been taught inthe schools which are now scattered all over great britain and ireland</s> some of my colleagues who have to deal with subjects such as geometryfor which the present teaching power is better organized i understandare likely to have three or four times as many papers</s>  so far as my ownsubjects are concerned i can undertake to say that a great deal of theteaching the results of which are before me in these examinations isvery sound and good and i think it is in the power of the examinersnot only to keep up the present standard but to cause an almostunlimited improvement</s>  now what does this mean</s>  it means that by holdingout a very moderate inducement the masters of primary schools in manyparts of the country have been led to convert them into little foci ofscientific instruction and that they and their pupils have contrived tofind or to make time enough to carry out this object with a veryconsiderable degree of efficiency</s>  that efficiency will i doubt not bevery much increased as the system becomes known and perfected even withthe very limited leisure left to masters and teachers on weekdays</s>  andthis leads me to ask why should scientific teaching be limited toweekdays</s> ecclesiasticallyminded persons are in the habit of calling things theydo not like by very hard names and i should not wonder if they brandthe proposition i am about to make as blasphemous and worse</s>  but notminding this i venture to ask would there really be anything wrong inusing part of sunday for the purpose of instructing those who have noother leisure in a knowledge of the phenomena of nature and of mansrelation to nature</s> i should like to see a scientific sundayschool in every parish not forthe purpose of superseding any existing means of teaching the peoplethe things that are for their good but side by side with them</s>  i cannotbut think that there is room for all of us to work in helping to bridgeover the great abyss of ignorance which lies at our feet</s> and if any of the ecclesiastical persons to whom i have referred objectthat they find it derogatory to the honour of the god whom they worshipto awaken the minds of the young to the infinite wonder and majesty ofthe works which they proclaim his and to teach them those laws whichmust needs be his laws and therefore of all things needful for man toknowi can only recommend them to be let

friend and colleague mr</s>  henfrey whoaddressed you on monday last but while for the sake of that order imust beg you to suppose that this discussion of the educational bearingsof biology in general does precede that of special zoology and botanyi am rejoiced to be able to take advantage of the light thus alreadythrown upon the tendency and methods of physiological science</s> regarding physiological science then in its widest senseas theequivalent of biologythe science of individual lifewe have toconsider in succession1</s>  its position and scope as a branch of knowledge</s> 2</s>  its value as a means of mental discipline</s> 3</s>  its worth as practical information</s> and lastly4</s>  at what period it may best be made a branch of education</s> our conclusions on the first of these heads must depend of course uponthe nature of the subjectmatter of biology and i think a fewpreliminary considerations will place before you in a clear light thevast difference which exists between the living bodies with whichphysiological science is concerned and the remainder of theuniversebetween the phnomena of number and space of physical and ofchemical force on the one hand and those of life on the other</s> the mathematician the physicist and the chemist contemplate things ina condition of rest they look upon a state of equilibrium as that towhich all bodies normally tend</s> the mathematician does not suppose that a quantity will alter or that agiven point in space will change its direction with regard to anotherpoint spontaneously</s>  and it is the same with the physicist</s>  when newtonsaw the apple fall he concluded at once that the act of falling was notthe result of any power inherent in the apple but that it was theresult of the action of something else on the apple</s>  in a similarmanner all physical force is regarded as the disturbance of anequilibrium to which things tended before its exertionto which theywill tend again after its cessation</s> the chemist equally regards chemical change in a as the effect of theaction of something external to the body changed</s>  a chemical compoundonce formed would persist for ever if no alteration took place insurrounding conditions</s> but to the student of life the aspect of nature is reversed</s>  hereincessant and so far as we know spontaneous change is the rule restthe exceptionthe anomaly to be accounted for</s>  living things have noinertia and tend to no equilibrium</s> permit me however to give more force and clearness to these somewhatabstract considerations by an illustration or two</s> imagine a vessel full of water at the ordinary temperature in anatmosphere saturated with vapour</s>  the quantity and the figure ofthat water will not change so far as we know for ever</s> suppose a lump of gold be thrown into the vesselmotion and disturbanceof figure exactly proportional to the momentum of the gold will takeplace</s>  but after a time the effects of this disturbance willsubsideequilibrium will be restored and the water will return to itspassive state</s> expose the water to coldit will solidifyand in so doing itsparticles will arrange themselves in definite crystalline shapes</s>  butonce formed these crystals change no further</s> again substitute for the lump of gold some substance capable ofentering into chemical relations with the watersay a mass of thatsubstance which is called proteinthe substance of flesha veryconsiderable disturbance of equilibrium will take placeall sorts ofchemical compositions and decompositions will occur but in the end asbefore the result will be the resumption of a condition of rest</s> instead of such a mass of dead protein however take a particle ofliving proteinone of those minute microscopic living things whichthrong our pools and are known as infusoriasuch a creature forinstance as an euglena and place it in our vessel of water</s>  it is around mass provided with a long filament and except in this peculiarityof shape presents no appreciable physical or chemical differencewhereby it might be distinguished from the particle of dead protein</s> but the difference in the phnomena to which it will give rise isimmense in the first place it will develop a vast quantity of physicalforcecleaving the water in all directions with considerable rapidityby means of the vibrations of the long filament or cilium</s> nor is the amount of chemical energy which the little creature possessesless striking</s>  it is a perfect laboratory in itself and it will act andreact upon the water and the matters contained therein converting theminto new compounds resembling its own substance and at the same timegiving up portions of its own substance which have become effete</s> furthermore the euglena will increase in size but this increase is byno means unlimited as the increase of a crystal might be</s>  after it hasgrown to a certain extent it divides and each portion assumes the formof the original and proceeds to repeat the process of growth anddivision</s> nor is this all</s>  for after a series of such divisions and subdivisionsthese minute points assume a totally new form lose their longtailsround themselves and secrete a sort of envelope or box in whichthey remain shut up for a time eventually to resume directly orindirectly their primitive mode of existence</s> now so far as we know there is no natural limit to the existence ofthe euglena or of any other living germ</s>  a living species once launchedinto existence tends to live for ever</s> consider how widely different this living particle is from the deadatoms with which the physicist and chemist have to do</s> the particle of gold falls to the bottom and reststhe particle of deadprotein decomposes and disappearsit also rests but the livingprotein mass neither tends to exhaustion of its forces nor to anypermanency of form but is essentially distinguished as a disturber ofequilibrium so far as force is concernedas undergoing continualmetamorphosis and change in point of form</s> tendency to equilibrium of force and to permanency of form then are thecharacters of that portion of the universe which does not livethedomain of the chemist and physicist</s> tendency to disturb existing equilibriumto take on forms whichsucceed one another in definite cycles is the character of the livingworld</s> what is the cause of this wonderful difference between the dead particleand the living particle of matter appearing in other respects identical</s> that difference to which we give the name of life</s> i for one cannot tell you</s>  it may be that by and by philosopherswill discover some higher laws of which the facts of life are particularcasesvery possibly they will find out some bond betweenphysicochemical phnomena on the one hand and vital phnomena on theother</s>  at present however we assuredly know of none and i think weshall exercise a wise humility in confessing that for us at least thissuccessive assumption of different statesexternal conditionsremaining the samethis spontaneity of actionif i may use a termwhich implies more than i would be answerable forwhich constitutes sovast and plain a practical distinction between living bodies and thosewhich do not live is an ultimate fact indicating as such theexistence of a broad line of demarcation between the subjectmatter ofbiological and that of all other sciences</s> for i would have it understood that this simple euglena is the type ofall living things so far as the distinction between these and inertmatter is concerned</s>  that cycle of changes which is constituted byperhaps not more than two or three steps in the euglena is as clearlymanifested in the multitudinous stages through which the germ of an oakor of a man passes</s>  whatever forms the living being may take on whethersimple or complex production growth reproduction are thephnomena which distinguish it from that which does not live</s> if this be true it is clear that the student in passing from thephysicochemical to the physiological sciences enters upon a totallynew order of facts and it will next be for us to consider how far thesenew facts involve new methods or require a modification of those withwhich he is already acquainted</s>  now a great deal is said about thepeculiarity of the scientific method in general and of the differentmethods which are pursued in the different sciences</s>  the mathematicsare said to have one special method physics another biology a thirdand so forth</s>  for my own part i must confess that i do not understandthis phraseology</s> so far as i can arrive at any clear comprehension of the matter scienceis not as many would seem to suppose a modification of the black artsuited to the tastes of the nineteenth century and flourishing mainlyin consequence of the decay of the inquisition</s> science is i believe nothing but trained and organized common sensediffering from the latter only as a veteran may differ from a rawrecruit and its methods differ from those of common sense only so faras the guardsmans cut and thrust differ from the manner in which asavage wields his club</s>  the primary power is the same in each case andperhaps the untutored savage has the more brawny arm of the two</s>  thereal advantage lies in the point and polish of the swordsmans weaponin the trained eye quick to spy out the weakness of the adversary inthe ready hand prompt to follow it on the instant</s>  but after all thesword exercise is only the hewing and poking of the clubman developedand perfected</s> so the vast results obtained by science are won by no mysticalfaculties by no mental processes other than those which are practisedby every one of us in the humblest and meanest affairs of life</s>  adetective policeman discovers a burglar from the marks made by his shoeby a mental process identical with that by which cuvier restored theextinct animals of montmartre from fragments of their bones</s>  nor doesthat process of induction and deduction by which a lady finding a stainof a peculiar kind upon her dress concludes that somebody has upsetthe inkstand thereon differ in any way in kind from that by whichadams and leverrier discovered a new planet</s> the man of science in fact simply uses with scrupulous exactness themethods which we all habitually and at every moment use carelesslyand the man of business must as much avail himself of the scientificmethodmust be as truly a man of scienceas the veriest bookworm of usall though i have no doubt that the man of business will find himselfout to be a philosopher with as much surprise as m</s>  jourdain exhibitedwhen he discovered that he had been all his life talking prose</s>  ifhowever there be no real difference between the methods of science andthose of common life it would seem on the face of the matter highlyimprobable that there should be any difference between the methods ofthe different sciences nevertheless it is constantly taken forgranted that there is a very wide difference between the physiologicaland other sciences in point of method</s> in the first place it is saidand i take this point first because theimputation is too frequently admitted by physiologists themselvesthatbiology differs from the physicochemical and mathematical sciences inbeing inexact</s> now this phrase inexact must refer either to the methods or to theresults of physiological science</s> it cannot be correct to apply it to the methods for as i hope to showyou by and by these are identical in all sciences and whatever is trueof physiological method is true of physical and mathematical method</s> is it then the results of biological science which are inexact</s>  ithink not</s>  if i say that respiration is performed by the lungs thatdigestion is effected in the stomach that the eye is the organ ofsight that the jaws of a vertebrated animal never open sideways butalways up and down while those of an annulose animal always opensideways and never up and downi am enumerating propositions which areas exact as anything in euclid</s>  how then has this notion of theinexactness of biological science come about</s>  i believe from two causesfirst because in consequence of the great complexity of the scienceand the multitude of interfering conditions we are very often onlyenabled to predict approximatively what will occur under givencircumstances and secondly because on account of the comparativeyouth of the physiological sciences a great many of their laws arestill imperfectly worked out</s>  but in an educational point of view itis most important to distinguish between the essence of a science andthe accidents which surround it and essentially the methods andresults of physiology are as exact as those of physics or mathematics</s> it is said that the physiological method is especially comparative4and this dictum also finds favour in the eyes of many</s>  i should besorry to suggest that the speculators on scientific classification havebeen misled by the accident of the name of one leading branch ofbiologycomparative anatomy but i would ask whether comparisonand that classification which is the result of comparison are not theessence of every science whatsoever</s>  how is it possible to discover arelation of cause and effect of any kind without comparing a series ofcases together in which the supposed cause and effect occur singly orcombined</s>  so far from comparison being in any way peculiar to biologicalscience it is i think the essence of every science</s> a speculative philosopher again tells us that the biological sciencesare distinguished by being sciences of observation and not ofexperiment</s> 5of all the strange assertions into which speculation without practicalacquaintance with a subject may lead even an able man i think this isthe very strangest</s>  physiology not an experimental science</s>  why thereis not a function of a single organ in the body which has not beendetermined wholly and solely by experiment</s>  how did harvey determine thenature of the circulation except by experiment</s>  how did sir charlesbell determine the functions of the roots of the spinal nerves save byexperiment</s>  how do we know the use of a nerve at all except byexperiment</s>  nay how do you know even that your eye is your seeingapparatus unless you make the experiment of shutting it or that yourear is your hearing apparatus unless you close it up and therebydiscover that you become deaf</s> it would really be much more true to say that physiology is theexperimental science par excellence of all sciences that in whichthere is least to be learnt by mere observation and that which affordsthe greatest field for the exercise of those faculties whichcharacterise the experimental philosopher</s>  i confess if any one were toask me for a model application of the logic of experiment i should knowno better work to put into his hands than bernards late researches onthe functions of the liver</s> 6not to give this lecture a too controversial tone however i must onlyadvert to one more doctrine held by a thinker of our own age andcountry whose opinions are worthy of all respect</s>  it is that thebiological sciences differ from all others inasmuch as in themclassification takes place by type and not by definition</s> 7it is said in short that a naturalhistory class is not capable ofbeing definedthat the class rosace for instance or the class offishes is not accurately and absolutely definable inasmuch as itsmembers will present exceptions to every possible definition and thatthe members of the class are united together only by the circumstancethat they are all more like some imaginary average rose or average fishthan they resemble anything else</s> but here as before i think the distinction has arisen entirely fromconfusing a transitory imperfection with an essential character</s>  so longas our information concerning them is imperfect we class all objectstogether according to resemblances which we feel but cannot definewe group them round types in short</s>  thus if you ask an ordinaryperson what kinds of animals there are he will probably say beastsbirds reptiles fishes insects c</s>  ask him to define a beast from areptile and he cannot do it but he says things like a cow or a horseare beasts and things like a frog or a lizard are reptiles</s>  you see hedoes class by type and not by definition</s>  but how does thisclassification differ from that of the scientific zoologist</s>  how doesthe meaning of the scientific classname of mammalia differ from theunscientific of beasts</s> why exactly because the former depends on a definition the latter on atype</s>  the class mammalia is scientifically defined as all animals whichhave a vertebrated skeleton and suckle their young</s>  here is noreference to type but a definition rigorous enough for a geometrician</s> and such is the character which every scientific naturalist recognisesas that to which his classes must aspireknowing as he does thatclassification by type is simply an acknowledgment of ignorance and atemporary device</s> so much in the way of negative argument as against the reputeddifferences between biological and other methods</s>  no such differencesi believe really exist</s>  the subjectmatter of biological science isdifferent from that of other sciences but the methods of all areidentical and these methods are1</s>  observation of factsincluding under this head that artificialobservation which is called experiment</s> 2</s>  that process of tying up similar facts into bundles ticketed andready for use which is called comparison and classificationtheresults of the process the ticketed bundles being named generalpropositions</s> 3</s>  deduction which takes us from the general proposition to factsagainteaches us if i may so say to anticipate from the ticket whatis inside the bundle</s>  and finally4</s>  verification which is the process of ascertaining whether inpoint of fact our anticipation is a correct one</s> such are the methods of all science whatsoever but perhaps you willpermit me to give you an illustration of their employment in the scienceof life and i will take as a special case the establishment of thedoctrine of the circulation of the blood</s> in this case simple observation yields us a knowledge of theexistence of the blood from some accidental hmorrhage we will say wemay even grant that it informs us of the localization of this blood inparticular vessels the heart c</s>  from some accidental cut or thelike</s>  it teaches also the existence of a pulse in various parts of thebody and acquaints us with the structure of the heart and vessels</s> here however simple observation stops and we must have recourse toexperiment</s> you tie a vein and you find that the blood accumulates on the side ofthe ligature opposite the heart</s>  you tie an artery and you find thatthe blood accumulates on the side near the heart</s>  open the chest andyou see the heart contracting with great force</s>  make openings into itsprincipal cavities and you will find that all the blood flows out andno more pressure is exerted on either side of the arterial or venousligature</s> now all these facts taken together constitute the evidence that theblood is propelled by the heart through the arteries and returns by theveinsthat in short the blood circulates</s> suppose our experiments and observations have been made on horses thenwe group and ticket them into a general proposition thusall horseshave a circulation of their blood</s> henceforward a horse is a sort of indication or label telling us wherewe shall find a peculiar series of phnomena called the circulation ofthe blood</s> here is our general proposition then</s> how and when are we justified in making our next stepa deductionfrom it</s> suppose our physiologist whose experience is limited to horses meetswith a zebra for the first timewill he suppose that thisgeneralization holds good for zebras also</s> that depends very much on his turn of mind</s>  but we will suppose him tobe a bold man</s>  he will say the zebra is certainly not a horse but itis very like oneso like that it must be the ticket or mark of abloodcirculation also and i conclude that the zebra has acirculation</s> that is a deduction a very fair deduction but by no means to beconsidered scientifically secure</s>  this last quality in fact can only begiven by verificationthat is by making a zebra the subject of allthe experiments performed on the horse</s>  of course in the present casethe deduction would be confirmed by this process of verificationand the result would be not merely a positive widening of knowledgebut a fair increase of confidence in the truth of ones generalizationsin other cases</s> thus having settled the point in the zebra and horse our philosopherwould have great confidence in the existence of a circulation in theass</s>  nay i fancy most persons would excuse him if in this case he didnot take the trouble to go through the process of verification at alland it would not be without a parallel in the history of the human mindif our imaginary physiologist now maintained that he was acquainted withasinine circulation  priori</s> however if i might impress any caution upon your minds it is theutterly conditional nature of all our knowledgethe danger ofneglecting the process of verification under any circumstances and thefilm upon which we rest the moment our deductions carry us beyond thereach of this great process of verification</s>  there is no better instanceof this than is afforded by the history of our knowledge of thecirculation of the blood in the animal kingdom until the year 1824</s>  inevery animal possessing a circulation at all which had been observed upto that time the current of the blood was known to take one definiteand invariable direction</s>  now there is a class of animals calledascidians which possess a heart and a circulation and up to theperiod of which i speak no one would have dreamt of questioning thepropriety of the deduction that these creatures have a circulation inone direction nor would any one have thought it worth while to verifythe point</s>  but in that year m</s>  von hasselt happening to examine atransparent animal of this class found to his infinite surprise thatafter the heart had beat a certain number of times it stopped and thenbegan beating the opposite wayso as to reverse the course of thecurrent which returned by and by to its original direction</s> i have myself timed the heart of these little animals</s>  i found it asregular as possible in its periods of reversal and i know no spectaclein the animal kingdom more wonderful than that which it presentsallthe more wonderful that to this day it remains an unique fact peculiarto this class among the whole animated world</s>  at the same time i know ofno more striking case of the necessity of the verification of eventhose deductions which seem founded on the widest and safest inductions</s> such are the methods of biologymethods which are obviously identicalwith those of all other sciences and therefore wholly incompetent toform the ground of any distinction between it and them</s> 8but i shall be asked at once do you mean to say that there is nodifference between the habit of mind of a mathematician and that of anaturalist</s>  do you imagine that laplace might have been put into thejardin des plantes and cuvier into the observatory with equaladvantage to the progress of the sciences they professed</s> to which i would reply that nothing could be further from my thoughts</s> but different habits and various special tendencies of two sciences donot imply different methods</s>  the mountaineer and the man of the plainshave very different habits of progression and each would be at a lossin the others place but the method of progression by putting one legbefore the other is the same in each case</s>  every step of each is acombination of a lift and a push but the mountaineer lifts more and thelowlander pushes more</s>  and i think the case of two sciences resemblesthis</s> i do not question for a moment that while the mathematician is busiedwith deductions from general propositions the biologist is moreespecially occupied with observation comparison and those processeswhich lead to general propositions</s>  all i wish to insist upon is thatthis difference depends not on any fundamental distinction in thesciences themselves but on the accidents of their subjectmatter oftheir relative complexity and consequent relative perfection</s> the mathematician deals with two properties of objects only number andextension and all the inductions he wants have been formed and finishedages ago</s>  he is occupied now with nothing but deduction andverification</s> the biologist deals with a vast number of properties of objects andhis inductions will not be completed i fear for ages to come but whenthey are his science will be as deductive and as exact as themathematics themselves</s> such is the relation of biology to those sciences which deal withobjects having fewer properties than itself</s>  but as the student inreaching biology looks back upon sciences of a less complex andtherefore more perfect nature so on the other hand does he lookforward to other more complex and less perfect branches of knowledge</s> biology deals only with living beings as isolated thingstreats only ofthe life of the individual but there is a higher division of sciencestill which considers living beings as aggregateswhich deals with therelation of living beings one to anotherthe science which observesmenwhose experiments are made by nations one upon another inbattlefieldswhose general propositions are embodied in historymorality and religionwhose deductions lead to our happiness or ourmiseryand whose verifications so often come too late and serveonly  to point a moral or adorn a talei mean the science of society or sociology</s> i think it is one of the grandest features of biology that it occupiesthis central position in human knowledge</s>  there is no side of the humanmind which physiological study leaves uncultivated</s>  connected byinnumerable ties with abstract science physiology is yet in the mostintimate relation with humanity and by teaching us that law and orderand a definite scheme of development regulate even

as minerals plants and animals thesciences which embody the knowledge man has acquired upon these subjectsare commonly termed natural sciences in contradistinction to othersocalled physical sciences and those who devote themselvesespecially to the pursuit of such sciences have been and are commonlytermed naturalists</s> linnus was a naturalist in this wide sense and his systema naturwas a work upon natural history in the broadest acceptation of theterm in it that great methodizing spirit embodied all that was knownin his time of the distinctive characters of minerals animals andplants</s>  but the enormous stimulus which linnus gave to theinvestigation of nature soon rendered it impossible that any one manshould write another systema natur and extremely difficult for anyone to become a naturalist such as linnus was</s> great as have been the advances made by all the three branches ofscience of old included under the title of natural history there canbe no doubt that zoology and botany have grown in an enormously greaterratio than mineralogy and hence as i suppose the name of naturalhistory has gradually become more and more definitely attached to theseprominent divisions of the subject and by naturalist people havemeant more and more distinctly to imply a student of the structure andfunctions of living beings</s> however this may be it is certain that the advance of knowledge hasgradually widened the distance between mineralogy and its oldassociates while it has drawn zoology and botany closer together sothat of late years it has been found convenient and indeed necessaryto associate the sciences which deal with vitality and all its phenomenaunder the common head of biology and the biologists have come torepudiate any bloodrelationship with their fosterbrothers themineralogists</s> certain broad laws have a general application throughout both the animaland the vegetable worlds but the ground common to these kingdoms ofnature is not of very wide extent and the multiplicity of details is sogreat that the student of living beings finds himself obliged to devotehis attention exclusively either to the one or the other</s>  if he electsto study plants under any aspect we know at once what to call him heis a botanist and his science is botany</s>  but if the investigation ofanimal life be his choice the name generally applied to him will varyaccording to the kind of animals he studies or the particular phenomenaof animal life to which he confines his attention</s>  if the study of manis his object he is called an anatomist or a physiologist or anethnologist but if he dissects animals or examines into the mode inwhich their functions are performed he is a comparative anatomist orcomparative physiologist</s>  if he turns his attention to fossil animalshe is a palontologist</s>  if his mind is more particularly directed to thedescription specific discrimination classification and distributionof animals he is termed a zoologist</s> for the purposes of the present discourse however i shall recognisenone of these titles save the last which i shall employ as theequivalent of botanist and i shall use the term zoology as denoting thewhole doctrine of animal life in contradistinction to botany whichsignifies the whole doctrine of vegetable life</s> employed in this sense zoology like botany is divisible into threegreat but subordinate sciences morphology physiology anddistribution each of which may to a very great extent be studiedindependently of the other</s> zoological morphology is the doctrine of animal form or structure</s> anatomy is one of its branches development is another whileclassification is the expression of the relations which differentanimals bear to one another in respect of their anatomy and theirdevelopment</s> zoological distribution is the study of animals in relation to theterrestrial conditions which obtain now or have obtained at anyprevious epoch of the earths history</s> zoological physiology lastly is the doctrine of the functions oractions of animals</s>  it regards animal bodies as machines impelled bycertain forces and performing an amount of work which can beexpressed in terms of the ordinary forces of nature</s>  the final object ofphysiology is to deduce the facts of morphology on the one hand andthose of distribution on the other from the laws of the molecularforces of matter</s> such is the scope of zoology</s>  but if i were to content myself with theenunciation of these dry definitions i should ill exemplify that methodof teaching this branch of physical science which it is my chiefbusiness tonight to recommend</s>  let us turn away then from abstractdefinitions</s>  let us take some concrete living thing some animal thecommoner the better and let us see how the application of common senseand common logic to the obvious facts it presents inevitably leads usinto all these branches of zoological science</s> i have before me a lobster</s>  when i examine it what appears to be themost striking character it presents</s>  why i observe that this part whichwe call the tail of the lobster is made up of six distinct hard ringsand a seventh terminal piece</s>  if i separate one of the middle rings saythe third i find it carries upon its under surface a pair of limbs orappendages each of which consists of a stalk and two terminal pieces</s> so that i can represent a transverse section of the ring and itsappendages upon the diagram board in this way</s> if i now take the fourth ring i find it has the same structure and sohave the fifth and the second so that in each of these divisions ofthe tail i find parts which correspond with one another a ring and twoappendages and in each appendage a stalk and two end pieces</s>  thesecorresponding parts are called in the technical language of anatomyhomologous parts</s>  the ring of the third division is the homologueof the ring of the fifth the appendage of the former is the homologueof the appendage of the latter</s>  and as each division exhibitscorresponding parts in corresponding places we say that all thedivisions are constructed upon the same plan</s>  but now let us considerthe sixth division</s>  it is similar to and yet different from theothers</s>  the ring is essentially the same as in the other divisions butthe appendages look at first as if they were very different and yetwhen we regard them closely what do we find</s>  a stalk and two terminaldivisions exactly as in the others but the stalk is very short andvery thick the terminal divisions are very broad and flat and one ofthem is divided into two pieces</s> i may say therefore that the sixth segment is like the others in planbut that it is modified in its details</s> the first segment is like the others so far as its ring is concernedand though its appendages differ from any of those yet examined in thesimplicity of their structure parts corresponding with the stem and oneof the divisions of the appendages of the other segments can be readilydiscerned in them</s> thus it appears that the lobsters tail is composed of a series ofsegments which are fundamentally similar though each presents peculiarmodifications of the plan common to all</s>  but when i turn to the forepart of the body i see at first nothing but a great shieldlike shellcalled technically the carapace ending in front in a sharp spine oneither side of which are the curious compound eyes set upon the ends ofstout moveable stalks</s>  behind these on the under side of the body aretwo pairs of long feelers or antenn followed by six pairs of jawsfolded against one another over the mouth and five pairs of legs theforemost of these being the great pinchers or claws of the lobster</s> it looks at first a little hopeless to attempt to find in this complexmass a series of rings each with its pair of appendages such as i haveshown you in the abdomen and yet it is not difficult to demonstratetheir existence</s>  strip off the legs and you will find that each pair isattached to a very definite segment of the under wall of the body butthese segments instead of being the lower parts of free rings as inthe tail are such parts of rings which are all solidly united and boundtogether and the like is true of the jaws the feelers and theeyestalks every pair of which is borne upon its own special segment</s> thus the conclusion is gradually forced upon us that the body of thelobster is composed of as many rings as there are pairs of appendagesnamely twenty in all but that the six hindmost rings remain free andmoveable while the fourteen front rings become firmly solderedtogether their backs forming one continuous shieldthe carapace</s> unity of plan diversity in execution is the lesson taught by the studyof the rings of the body and the same instruction is given still moreemphatically by the appendages</s>  if i examine the outermost jaw i find itconsists of three distinct portions an inner a middle and an outermounted upon a common stem and if i compare this jaw with the legsbehind it or the jaws in front of it i find it quite easy to seethat in the legs it is the part of the appendage which correspondswith the inner division which becomes modified into what we knowfamiliarly as the leg while the middle division disappears and theouter division is hidden under the carapace</s>  nor is it more difficult todiscern that in the appendages of the tail the middle division appearsagain and the outer vanishes while on the other hand in the foremostjaw the socalled mandible the inner division only is left and inthe same way the parts of the feelers and of the eyestalks can beidentified with those of the legs and jaws</s> but whither does all this tend</s>  to the very remarkable conclusion that aunity of plan of the same kind as that discoverable in the tail orabdomen of the lobster pervades the whole organization of its skeletonso that i can return to the diagram representing any one of the rings ofthe tail which i drew upon the board and by adding a third division toeach appendage i can use it as a sort of scheme or plan of any ring ofthe body</s>  i can give names to all the parts of that figure and then ifi take any segment of the body of the lobster i can point out to youexactly what modification the general plan has undergone in thatparticular segment what part has remained moveable and what has becomefixed to another what has been excessively developed and metamorphosedand what has been suppressed</s> but i imagine i hear the question how is all this to be tested</s>  nodoubt it is a pretty and ingenious way of looking at the structure ofany animal but is it anything more</s>  does nature acknowledge in anydeeper way this unity of plan we seem to trace</s> the objection suggested by these questions is a very valid and importantone and morphology was in an unsound state so long as it rested uponthe mere perception of the analogies which obtain between fully formedparts</s>  the unchecked ingenuity of speculative anatomists proved itselffully competent to spin any number of contradictory hypotheses out ofthe same facts and endless morphological dreams threatened to supplantscientific theory</s> happily however there is a criterion of morphological truth and asure test of all homologies</s>  our lobster has not always been what we seeit it was once an egg a semifluid mass of yolk not so big as a pinshead contained in a transparent membrane and exhibiting not the leasttrace of any one of those organs whose multiplicity and complexity inthe adult are so surprising</s>  after a time a delicate patch of cellularmembrane appeared upon one face of this yolk and that patch was thefoundation of the whole creature the clay out of which it would bemoulded</s>  gradually investing the yolk it became subdivided bytransverse constrictions into segments the forerunners of the rings ofthe body</s>  upon the ventral surface of each of the rings thus sketchedout a pair of budlike prominences made their appearancethe rudimentsof the appendages of the ring</s>  at first all the appendages were alikebut as they grew most of them became distinguished into a stem and twoterminal divisions to which in the middle part of the body was addeda third outer division and it was only at a later period that by themodification or abortion of certain of these primitive constituentsthe limbs acquired their perfect form</s> thus the study of development proves that the doctrine of unity of planis not merely a fancy that it is not merely one way of looking at thematter but that it is the expression of deepseated natural facts</s>  thelegs and jaws of the lobster may not merely be regarded as modificationsof a common typein fact and in nature they are sothe leg and thejaw of the young animal being at first indistinguishable</s> these are wonderful truths the more so because the zoologist finds themto be of universal application</s>  the investigation of a polype of asnail of a fish of a horse or of a man would have led us though bya less easy path perhaps to exactly the same point</s>  unity of planeverywhere lies hidden under the mask of diversity of structurethecomplex is everywhere evolved out of the simple</s>  every animal has atfirst the form of an egg and every animal and every organic part inreaching its adult state passes through conditions common to otheranimals and other adult parts and this leads me to another point</s>  ihave hitherto spoken as if the lobster were alone in the world but asi need hardly remind you there are myriads of other animal organisms</s> of these some such as men horses birds fishes snails slugsoysters corals and sponges are not in the least like the lobster</s>  butother animals though they may differ a good deal from the lobster areyet either very like it or are like something that is like it</s>  the crayfish the rock lobster and the prawn and the shrimp for examplehowever different are yet so like lobsters that a child would groupthem as of the lobster kind in contradistinction to snails and slugsand these last again would form a kind by themselves incontradistinction to cows horses and sheep the cattle kind</s> but this spontaneous grouping into kinds is the first essay of thehuman mind at classification or the calling by a common name of thosethings that are alike and the arranging them in such a manner as bestto suggest the sum of their likenesses and unlikenesses to other things</s> those kinds which include no other subdivisions than the sexes orvarious breeds are called in technical language species</s>  the englishlobster is a species our cray fish is another our prawn is another</s>  inother countries however there are lobsters cray fish and prawnsvery like ours and yet presenting sufficient differences to deservedistinction</s>  naturalists therefore express this resemblance and thisdiversity by grouping them as distinct species of the same genus</s>  butthe lobster and the cray fish though belonging to distinct genera havemany features in common and hence are grouped together in an assemblagewhich is called a family</s>  more distant resemblances connect the lobsterwith the prawn and the crab which are expressed by putting all theseinto the same order</s>  again more remote but still very definiteresemblances unite the lobster with the woodlouse the king crab thewaterflea and the barnacle and separate them from all other animalswhence they collectively constitute the larger group or classcrustacea</s>  but the crustacea exhibit many peculiar features incommon with insects spiders and centipedes so that these are groupedinto the still larger assemblage or province articulata andfinally the relations which these have to worms and other loweranimals are expressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into thesubkingdom of annulosa</s> if i had worked my way from a sponge instead of a lobster i should havefound it associated by like ties with a great number of other animalsinto the subkingdom protozoa if i had selected a freshwater polypeor a coral the members of what naturalists term the subkingdomclenterata would have grouped themselves around my type had a snailbeen chosen the inhabitants of all univalve and bivalve land andwater shells the lamp shells the squids and the seamat would havegradually linked themselves on to it as members of the same subkingdomof mollusca and finally starting from man i should have beencompelled to admit first the ape the rat the horse the dog into thesame class and then the bird the crocodile the turtle the frog andthe fish into the same subkingdom of vertebrata</s> and if i had followed out all these various lines of classificationfully i should discover in the end that there was no animal eitherrecent or fossil which did not at once fall into one or other of thesesubkingdoms</s>  in other words every animal is organized upon one orother of the five or more plans whose existence renders ourclassification possible</s>  and so definitely and precisely marked is thestructure of each animal that in the present state of our knowledgethere is not the least evidence to prove that a form in the slightestdegree transitional between any of the two groups vertebrata annulosamollusca and clenterata either exists or has existed during thatperiod of the earths history which is recorded by the geologist</s> nevertheless you must not for a moment suppose because no suchtransitional forms are known that the members of the subkingdoms aredisconnected from or independent of one another</s>  on the contrary intheir earliest condition they are all alike and the primordial germsof a man a dog a bird a fish a beetle a snail and a polype are inno essential structural respects distinguishable</s> in this broad sense it may with truth be said that all living animalsand all those dead creations which geology reveals are bound togetherby an allpervading unity of organization of the same character thoughnot equal in degree to that which enables us to discern one and thesame plan amidst the twenty different segments of a lobsters body</s> truly it has been said that to a clear eye the smallest fact is awindow through which the infinite may be seen</s> turning from these purely morphological considerations let us nowexamine into the manner in which the attentive study of the lobsterimpels us into other lines of research</s> lobsters are found in all the european seas but on the opposite shoresof the atlantic and in the seas of the southern hemisphere they do notexist</s>  they are however represented in these regions by very closelyallied but distinct formsthe homarus americanus and the homaruscapensis so that we may say that the european has one species ofhomarus the american another the african another and thus theremarkable facts of geographical distribution begin to dawn upon us</s> again if we examine the contents of the earths crust we shall find inthe latter of those deposits which have served as the great buryinggrounds of past ages numberless lobsterlike animals but none sosimilar to our living lobster as to make zoologists sure that theybelonged even to the same genus</s>  if we go still further back in timewe discover in the oldest rocks of all the remains of animalsconstructed on the same general plan as the lobster and belonging tothe same great group of crustacea but for the most part totallydifferent from the lobster and indeed from any other living form ofcrustacean and thus we gain a notion of that successive change of theanimal population of the globe in past ages which is the most strikingfact revealed by geology</s> consider now where our inquiries have led us</s>  we studied our typemorphologically when we determined its anatomy and its development andwhen comparing it in these respects with other animals we made outits place in a system of classification</s>  if we were to examine everyanimal in a similar manner we should establish a complete body ofzoological morphology</s> again we investigated the distribution of our type in space and intime and if the like had been done with every animal the sciences ofgeographical and geological distribution would have attained theirlimit</s> but you will observe one remarkable circumstance that up to thispoint the question of the life of these organisms has not come underconsideration</s>  morphology and distribution might be studied almost aswell if animals and plants were a peculiar kind of crystals andpossessed none of those functions which distinguish living beings soremarkably</s>  but the facts of morphology and distribution have to beaccounted for and the science whose aim it is to account for them isphysiology</s> let us return to our lobster once more</s>  if we watched the creature inits native element we should see it climbing actively the submergedrocks among which it delights to live by means of its strong legs orswimming by powerful strokes of its great tail the appendages of whosesixth joint are spread out into a broad fanlike propeller seize itand it will show you that its great claws are no mean weapons ofoffence suspend a piece of carrion among its haunts and it willgreedily devour it tearing and crushing the flesh by means of itsmultitudinous jaws</s> suppose that we had known nothing of the lobster but as an inert massan organic crystal if i may use the phrase and that we could suddenlysee it exerting all these powers what wonderful new ideas and newquestions would arise in our minds</s>  the great new question would behow does all this take place</s>  the chief new idea would be the idea ofadaptation to purposethe notion that the constituents of animalbodies are not mere unconnected parts but organs working together to anend</s>  let us consider the tail of the lobster again from this point ofview</s>  morphology has taught us that it is a series of segments composedof homologous parts which undergo various modificationsbeneath andthrough which a common plan of formation is discernible</s>  but if i lookat the same part physiologically i see that it is a most beautifullyconstructed organ of locomotion by means of which the animal canswiftly propel itself either backwards or forwards</s> but how is this remarkable propulsive machine made to perform itsfunctions</s>  if i were suddenly to kill one of these animals and to takeout all the soft parts i should find the shell to be perfectly inertto have no more power of moving itself than is possessed by themachinery of a mill when disconnected from its steamengine orwaterwheel</s>  but if i were to open it and take out the viscera onlyleaving the white flesh i should perceive that the lobster could bendand extend its tail as well as before</s>  if i were to cut off the tail ishould cease to find any spontaneous motion in it but on pinching anyportion of the flesh i should observe that it underwent a very curiouschangeeach fibre becoming shorter and thicker</s>  by this act ofcontraction as it is termed the parts to which the ends of the fibreare attached are of course approximated and according to therelations of their points of attachment to the centres of motion of thedifferent rings the bending or the extension of the tail results</s>
 closeobservation of the newly opened lobster would soon show that all itsmovements are due to the same causethe shortening and thickening ofthese fleshy fibres which are technically called muscles</s> here then is a capital fact</s>  the movements of the lobster are due tomuscular contractility</s>  but why does a muscle contract at one time andnot at another</s>  why does one whole group of muscles contract when thelobster wishes to extend his tail and another group when he desires tobend it</s>  what is it originates directs and controls the motive power</s> experiment the great instrument for the ascertainment of truth inphysical science answers this question for us</s>  in the head of thelobster there lies a small mass of that peculiar tissue which is knownas nervous substance</s>  cords of similar matter connect this brain of thelobster directly or indirectly with the muscles</s>  now if thesecommunicating cords are cut the brain remaining entire the power ofexerting what we call voluntary motion in the parts below the section isdestroyed and on the other hand if the cords remaining entire thebrain mass be destroyed the same voluntary mobility is equally lost</s> whence the inevitable conclusion is that the power of originating thesemotions resides in the brain and is propagated along the nervous cords</s> in the higher animals the phnomena which attend this transmission havebeen investigated and the exertion of the peculiar energy which residesin the nerves has been found to be accompanied by a disturbance of theelectrical state of their molecules</s> if we could exactly estimate the signification of this disturbance ifwe could obtain the value of a given exertion of nerve force bydetermining the quantity of electricity or of heat of which it is theequivalent if we could ascertain upon what arrangement or othercondition of the molecules of matter the manifestation of the nervousand muscular energies depends and doubtless science will some day orother ascertain these points physiologists would have attained theirultimate goal in this direction they would have determined the relationof the motive force of animals to the other forms of force found innature and if the same process had been successfully performed for allthe operations which are carried on in and by the animal framephysiology would be perfect and the facts of morphology anddistribution would be deducible from the laws which physiologists hadestablished combined with those determining the condition of thesurrounding universe</s> there is not a fragment of the organism of this humble animal whosestudy would not lead us into regions of thought as large as those whichi have briefly opened up to you but what i have been saying i trusthas not only enabled you to form a conception of the scope and purportof zoology but has given you an imperfect example of the manner inwhich in my opinion that science or indeed any physical science maybe best taught</s>  the great matter is to make teaching real andpractical by fixing the attention of the student on particular factsbut at the same time it should be rendered broad and comprehensive byconstant reference to the generalizations of which all particular factsare illustrations</s>  the lobster has served as a type of the whole animalkingdom and its anatomy and physiology have illustrated for us some ofthe greatest truths of biology</s>  the student who has once seen forhimself the facts which i have described has had their relationsexplained to him and has clearly comprehended them has so far aknowledge of zoology which is real and genuine however limited it maybe and which is worth more than all the mere reading knowledge of thescience he could ever acquire</s>  his zoological information is so farknowledge and not mere hearsay</s> and if it were my business to fit you for the certificate in zoologicalscience granted by this department i should pursue a course preciselysimilar in principle to that which i have taken tonight</s>  i shouldselect a freshwater sponge a freshwater polype or a cyana afreshwater mussel a lobster a fowl as types of the five primarydivisions of the animal kingdom</s>  i should explain their structure veryfully and show how each illustrated the great principles of zoology</s> having gone very carefully and fully over this ground i should feelthat you had a safe foundation and i should then take you in the sameway but less minutely over similarly selected illustrative types ofthe classes and then i should direct your attention to the specialforms enumerated under the head of types in this syllabus and to theother facts there mentioned</s> that would speaking generally be my plan</s>  but i have undertaken toexplain to you the best mode of acquiring and communicating a knowledgeof zoology and you may therefore fairly ask me for a more detailed andprecise account of the manner in which i should propose to furnish youwith the information i refer to</s> my own impression is that the best model for all kinds of training inphysical science is that afforded by the method of teaching anatomy inuse in the medical schools</s>  this method consists of threeelementslectures demonstrations and examinations</s> the object of lectures is in the first place to awaken the attentionand excite the enthusiasm of the student and this i am sure may beeffected to a far greater extent by the oral discourse and by thepersonal influence of a respected teacher than in any other way</s> secondly lectures have the double use of guiding the student to thesalient points of a subject and at the same time forcing him to attendto the whole of it and not merely to that part which takes his fancy</s> and lastly lectures afford the student the opportunity of seekingexplanations of those difficulties which will and indeed ought toarise in the course of his studies</s> but for a student to derive the utmost possible value from lecturesseveral precautions are needful</s> i have a strong impression that the better a discourse is as anoration the worse it is as a lecture</s>  the flow of the discourse carriesyou on without proper attention to its sense you drop a word or aphrase you lose the exact meaning for a moment and while you strive torecover yourself the speaker has passed on to something else</s> the practice i have adopted of late years in lecturing to students isto condense the substance of the hours discourse into a few drypropositions which are read slowly and taken down from dictation thereading of each being followed by a free commentary expanding andillustrating the proposition explaining terms and removing anydifficulties that may be attackable in that way by diagrams maderoughly and seen to grow under the lecturers hand</s>  in this manner youat any rate insure the cooperation of the student to a certain extent</s> he cannot leave the lectureroom entirely empty if the taking of notesis enforced and a student must be preternaturally dull and mechanicalif he can take notes and hear them properly explained and yet learnnothing</s> what books shall i read</s>  is a question constantly put by the student tothe teacher</s>  my reply usually is none write your notes out carefullyand fully strive to understand them thoroughly come to me for theexplanation of anything you cannot understand and i would rather youdid not distract your mind by reading</s>  a properly composed course oflectures ought to contain fully as much matter as a student canassimilate in the time occupied by its delivery and the teacher shouldalways recollect that his business is to feed and not to cram theintellect</s>  indeed i believe that a student who gains from a course oflectures the simple habit of concentrating his attention upon adefinitely limited series of facts until they are thoroughly masteredhas made a step of immeasurable importance</s> but however good lectures may be and however extensive the course ofreading by which they are followed up they are but accessories to thegreat instrument of scientific teachingdemonstration</s>  if i insistunweariedly nay fanatically upon the importance of physical science asan educational agent it is because the study of any branch of scienceif properly conducted appears to me to fill up a void left by all othermeans of education</s>  i have the greatest respect and love for literaturenothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than avery prominent branch of education indeed i wish that real literarydiscipline were far more attended to than it is but i cannot shut myeyes to the fact that there is a vast difference between men who havehad a purely literary and those who have had a sound scientifictraining</s> seeking for the cause of this difference i imagine i can find it in thefact that in the world of letters learning and knowledge are one andbooks are the source of both whereas in science as in life learningand knowledge are distinct and the study of things and not of booksis the source of the latter</s> all that literature has to bestow may be obtained by reading and bypractical exercise in writing and in speaking but i do not exaggeratewhen i say that none of the best gifts of science are to be won bythese means</s>  on the contrary the great benefit which a scientificeducation bestows whether as training or as knowledge is dependentupon the extent to which the mind of the student is brought intoimmediate contact with factsupon the degree to which he learns thehabit of appealing directly to nature and of acquiring through hissenses concrete images of those properties of things which are andalways will be but approximatively expressed in human language</s>  our wayof looking at nature and of speaking about her varies from year toyear but a fact once seen a relation of cause and effect oncedemonstratively apprehended are possessions which neither change norpass away but on the contrary form fixed centres about which othertruths aggregate by natural affinity</s> therefore the great business of the scientific teacher is to imprintthe fundamental irrefragable facts of his science not only by wordsupon the mind but by sensible impressions upon the eye and ear andtouch of the student in so complete a manner that every term used orlaw enunciated should afterwards call up vivid images of the particularstructural or other facts which furnished the demonstration of thelaw or the illustration of the term</s> now this important operation can only be achieved by constantdemonstration which may take place to a certain imperfect extent duringa lecture but which ought also to be carried on independently andwhich should be addressed to each individual student the teacherendeavouring not so much to show a thing to the learner as to make himsee it for himself</s> i am well aware that there are great practical difficulties in the wayof effectual zoological demonstrations</s>  the dissection of animals isnot altogether pleasant and requires much time nor is it easy tosecure an adequate supply of the needful specimens</s>  the botanist hashere a great advantage his specimens are easily obtained are clean andwholesome and can be dissected in a private house as well as anywhereelse and hence i believe the fact that botany is so much morereadily and better taught than its sister science</s>  but be it difficultor be it easy if zoological science is to be properly studieddemonstration and consequently dissection must be had</s>  without itno man can have a really sound knowledge of animal organization</s> a good deal may be done however without actual dissection on thestudents part by demonstration upon specimens and preparations and inall probability it would not be very difficult were the demandsufficient to organize collections of such objects sufficient for allthe purposes of elementary teaching at a comparatively cheap rate</s>  evenwithout these much might be effected if the zoological collectionswhich are open to the public were arranged according to what has beentermed the typical principle that is to say if the specimens exposedto public view were so selected that the public could learn somethingfrom them instead of being as at present merely confused by theirmultiplicity</s>  for example the grand ornithological gallery at thebritish museum contains between two and three thousand species of birdsand sometimes five or six specimens of a species</s>  they are very prettyto look at and some of the cases are indeed splendid but undertaketo say that no man but a professed ornithologist has ever gatheredmuch information from the collection</s>  certainly no one of the tens ofthousands of the general public who have walked through that galleryever knew more about the essential peculiarities of birds when he leftthe gallery than when he entered it</s>  but if somewhere in that vasthall there were a few preparations exemplifying the leading structuralpeculiarities and the mode of development of a common fowl if the typesof the genera the leading modifications in the skeleton in the plumageat various ages in the mode of nidification and the like among birdswere displayed and if the other specimens were put away in a placewhere the men of science to whom they are alone useful could have freeaccess to them i can conceive that this collection might become a greatinstrument of scientific education</s> the last implement of the teacher to which i have adverted isexaminationa means of education now so thoroughly understood that ineed hardly enlarge upon it</s>  i hold that both written and oralexaminations are indispensable and by requiring the description ofspecimens they may be made to supplement demonstration</s> such is the fullest reply the time at my disposal will allow me to giveto the questionhow may a knowledge of zoology be best acquired andcommunicated</s> but there is a previous question which may be moved and which in facti know many are inclined to move</s>  it is the question why shouldtraining masters be encouraged to acquire a knowledge of this or anyother branch of physical science</s>  what is the use it is said ofattempting to make physical science a branch of primary education</s>  itis not probable that teachers in pursuing such studies will be ledastray from the acquirement of more important but less attractiveknowledge</s>  and even if they can learn something of science withoutprejudice to their usefulness what is the good of their attempting toinstil that knowledge into boys whose real business is the acquisitionof reading writing and arithmetic</s> these questions are and will be very commonly asked for they arisefrom that profound ignorance of the value and true position of physicalscience which infests the minds of the most highly educated andintelligent classes of the community</s>  but if i did not feel well assuredthat they are capable of being easily and satisfactorily answered thatthey have been answered over and over again and that the time will comewhen men of liberal education will blush to raise such questionsishould be ashamed of my position here tonight</s>  without doubt it isyour great and very important function to carry out elementaryeducation without question anything that should interfere with thefaithful fulfilment of that duty on your part would be a great evil andif i thought that your acquirement of the elements of physical scienceand your communication of those elements to your pupils involved anysort of interference with your proper duties i should be the firstperson to protest against your being encouraged to do anything of thekind</s> but is it true that the acquisition of such a knowledge of science as isproposed and the communication of that knowledge are calculated toweaken your usefulness</s>  or may i not rather ask is it possible for youto discharge your functions properly without these aids</s> what is the purpose of primary intellectual education</s>  i apprehend thatits first object is to train the young in the use of those toolswherewith men extract knowledge from the evershifting succession ofphenomena which pass before their eyes and that its second object is toinform them of the fundamental laws which have been found by experienceto govern the course of things so that they may not be turned out intothe world naked defenceless and a prey to the events they mightcontrol</s> a boy is taught to read his own and other languages in order that hemay have access to infinitely wider stores of knowledge than could everbe opened to him by oral intercourse with his fellow men he learns towrite that his means of communication with the rest of mankind may beindefinitely enlarged and that he may record and store up the knowledgehe acquires</s>  he is taught elementary mathematics that he may understandall those relations of number and form upon which the transactions ofmen associated in complicated societies are built and that he mayhave some practice in deductive reasoning</s> all these operations of reading writing and ciphering areintellectual tools whose use should before all things be learned andlearned thoroughly so that the youth may be enabled to make his lifethat which it ought to be a continual progress in learning and inwisdom</s> but in addition primary education endeavours to fit a boy out with acertain equipment of positive knowledge</s>  he is taught the great laws ofmorality the religion of his sect so much history and geography aswill tell him where the great countries of the world are what they areand how they have become what they are</s> without doubt all these are most fitting and excellent things to teach aboy i should be very sorry to omit any of them from any scheme ofprimary intellectual education</s>  the system is excellent so far as itgoes</s> but if i regard it closely a curious reflection arises</s>  i suppose thatfifteen hundred years ago the child of any welltodo roman citizen wastaught just these same things reading and writing in his own andperhaps the greek tongue the elements of mathematics and thereligion morality history and geography current in his time</s> furthermore i do not think i err in affirming that if such achristian roman boy who had finished his education could betransplanted into one of our public schools and pass through its courseof instruction he would not meet with a single unfamiliar line ofthought amidst all the new facts he would have to learn not one wouldsuggest a different mode of regarding the universe from that current inhis own time</s> and yet surely there is some great difference between the civilizationof the fourth century and that of the nineteenth and still more betweenthe intellectual habits and tone of thought of that day and this</s> and what has made this difference</s>  i answer fearlesslythe prodigiousdevelopment of physical science within the last two centuries</s> modern civilization rests upon physical science take away her gifts toour own country and our position among the leading nations of the worldis gone tomorrow for it is physical science only that makesintelligence and moral energy stronger than brute force</s> the whole of modern thought is steeped in science it has made its wayinto the works of our best poets and even the mere man of letters whoaffects to ignore and despise science is unconsciously impregnated withher spirit and indebted for his best products to her methods</s>  i believethat the greatest intellectual revolution mankind has yet seen is nowslowly taking place by her agency</s>  she is teaching the world that theultimate court of appeal is observation and experiment and notauthority she is teaching it to estimate the value of evidence she iscreating a firm and living faith in the existence of immutable moral andphysical laws perfect obedience to which is the highest possible aim ofan intelligent being</s> but of all this your old stereotyped system of education takes no note</s> physical science its methods its problems and its difficulties willmeet the poorest boy at every turn and yet we educate him in such amanner that he shall enter the world as ignorant of the existence of themethods and facts of science as the day he was born</s>  the modern world isfull of artillery and we turn out our children to do battle in itequipped with the shield and sword of an ancient gladiator</s> posterity will cry shame on us if we do not remedy this deplorable stateof things</s>  nay if we live twenty years longer our own consciences willcry shame on us</s> it is my firm conviction that the only way to remedy it is to make theelements of physical science an integral part of primary education</s>  ihave endeavoured to show you how that may be done for that branch ofscience which it is my business to pursue and i can but add that ishould look upon the day when every schoolmaster throughout this landwas a centre of genuine however rudimentary scientific knowledge asan epoch in the history of the country</s> but let me entreat you to remember my last words</s>  addressing myself toyou as teachers i would say mere book learning in physical science isa sham and a delusionwhat you teach unless you wish to be impostorsthat you must first know and real knowledge in science means personalacquaintance with the facts be they few or many</s> 9footnote9 it has been suggested to me that these words may be taken to imply adiscouragement on my part of any sort of scientific instruction whichdoes not give an acquaintance with the facts at first hand</s>  but this isnot my meaning</s>  the ideal of scientific teaching is no doubt a systemby which the scholar sees every fact for himself and the teachersupplies only the explanations</s>  circumstances however do not oftenallow of the attainment of that ideal and we must put up with the nextbest systemone in which the scholar takes a good deal on trust from ateacher who knowing the facts by his own knowledge can describe themwith so much vividness as to enable his audience to form competent ideasconcerning them</s>  the system which i repudiate is that which allowsteachers who have not come into direct contact with the leading facts ofa science to pass their secondhand information on</s>  the scientificvirus like vaccine lymph if passed through too long a succession oforganisms will lose all its effect in protecting the young against theintellectual epidemics to which they are exposed</s> vii</s> on the physical basis of life</s> 10in order to make the title of this discourse generally intelligible ihave translated the term protoplasm which is the scientific name ofthe substance of which i am about to speak by the words the physicalbasis of life</s>  i suppose that to many the idea that there is such athing as a physical basis or matter of life may be novelso widelyspread is the conception of life as a something which works throughmatter but is independent of it and even those who are aware thatmatter and life are inseparably connected may not be prepared for theconclusion plainly suggested by the phrase the physical basis ormatter of life that there is some one kind of matter which is commonto all living beings and that their endless diversities are boundtogether by a physical as well as an ideal unity</s>  in fact when firstapprehended such a doctrine as this appears almost shocking to commonsense</s> what truly can seem to be more obviously different from one another infaculty in form and in substance than the various kinds of livingbeings</s>  what community of faculty can there be between thebrightlycoloured lichen which so nearly resembles a mere mineralincrustation of the bare rock on which it grows and the painter towhom it is instinct with beauty or the botanist whom it feeds withknowledge</s> again think of the microscopic fungusa mere infinitesimal ovoidparticle which finds space and duration enough to multiply intocountless millions in the body of a living fly and then of the wealthof foliage the luxuriance of flower and fruit which lies between thisbald sketch of a plant and the giant pine of california towering to thedimensions of a cathedral spire or the indian fig which covers acreswith its profound shadow and endures while nations and empires come andgo around its vast circumference</s>  or turning to the other half of theworld of life picture to yourselves the great finner whale hugest ofbeasts that live or have lived disporting his eighty or ninety feet ofbone muscle and blubber with easy roll among waves in which thestoutest ship that ever left dockyard would founder hopelessly andcontrast him with the invisible animalculesmere gelatinous specksmultitudes of which could in fact dance upon the point of a needlewith the same ease as the angels of the schoolmen could in imagination</s> with these images before your minds you may well ask what communityof form or structure is there between the animalcule and the whale orbetween the fungus and the figtree</s>  and  fortiori between allfour</s> finally if we regard substance or material composition what hiddenbond can connect the flower which a girl wears in her hair and the bloodwhich courses through her youthful veins or what is there in commonbetween the dense and resisting mass of the oak or the strong fabric ofthe tortoise and those broad disks of glassy jelly which may be seenpulsating through the waters of a calm sea but which drain away to merefilms in the hand which raises them out of their element</s> such objections as these must i think arise in the mind of every onewho ponders for the first time upon the conception of a singlephysical basis of life underlying all the diversities of vitalexistence but i propose to demonstrate to you that notwithstandingthese apparent difficulties a threefold unitynamely a unity ofpower or faculty a unity of form and a unity of substantialcompositiondoes pervade the whole living world</s> no very abstruse argumentation is needed in the first place to provethat the powers or faculties of all kinds of living matter diverse asthey may be in degree are substantially similar in kind</s> goethe has condensed a survey of all the powers of mankind into thewellknown epigram  warum treibt sich das volk so und schreit</s>  es will sich ernhren  kinder zeugen und die nhren so gut es vermag</s>             weiter bringt es kein mensch stell er sich wie er auch will</s> in physiological language this means that all the multifarious andcomplicated activities of man are comprehensible under three categories</s> either they are immediately directed towards the maintenance anddevelopment of the body or they effect transitory changes in therelative positions of parts of the body or they tend towards thecontinuance of the species</s>  even those manifestations of intellect offeeling and of will which we rightly name the higher faculties arenot excluded from this classification inasmuch as to every one but thesubject of them they are known only as transitory changes in therelative positions of parts of the body</s>  speech gesture and everyother form of human action are in the long run resolvable intomuscular contraction and muscular contraction is but a transitorychange in the relative positions of the parts of a muscle</s>  but thescheme which is large enough to embrace the activities of the highestform of life covers all those of the lower creatures</s>  the lowest plantor animalcule feeds grows and reproduces its kind</s>  in addition allanimals manifest those transitory changes of form which we class underirritability and contractility and it is more than probable that whenthe vegetable world is thoroughly explored we shall find all plants inpossession of the same powers at one time or other of their existence</s> i am not now alluding to such phnomena at once rare and conspicuousas those exhibited by the leaflets of the sensitive plant or thestamens of the barberry but to much more widelyspread and at thesame time more subtle and hidden manifestations of vegetablecontractility</s>  you are doubtless aware that the common nettle owes itsstinging property to the innumerable stiff and needlelike thoughexquisitely delicate hairs which cover its surface</s>  eachstingingneedle tapers from a broad base to a slender summit whichthough rounded at the end is of such microscopic fineness that itreadily penetrates and breaks off in the skin</s>  the whole hair consistsof a very delicate outer case of wood closely applied to the innersurface of which is a layer of semifluid matter full of innumerablegranules of extreme minuteness</s>  this semifluid lining is protoplasmwhich thus constitutes a kind of bag full of a limpid liquid androughly corresponding in form with the interior of the hair which itfills</s>  when viewed with a sufficiently high magnifying power theprotoplasmic layer of the nettle hair is seen to be in a condition ofunceasing activity</s>  local contractions of the whole thickness of itssubstance pass slowly and gradually from point to point and give riseto the appearance of progressive waves just as the bending ofsuccessive stalks of corn by a breeze produces the apparent billows of acornfield</s> but in addition to these movements and independently of them thegranules are driven in relatively rapid streams through channels inthe protoplasm which seem to have a considerable amount of persistence</s> most commonly the currents in adjacent parts of the protoplasm takesimilar directions and thus there is a general stream up one side ofthe hair and down the other</s>  but this does not prevent the existence ofpartial currents which take different routes and sometimes trains ofgranules may be seen coursing swiftly in opposite directions within atwentythousandth of an inch of one another while occasionallyopposite streams come into direct collision and after a longer orshorter struggle one predominates</s>  the cause of these currents seemsto lie in contractions of the protoplasm which bounds the channels inwhich they flow but which are so minute that the best microscopes showonly their effects and not themselves</s> the spectacle afforded by the wonderful energies prisoned within thecompass of the microscopic hair of a plant which we commonly regard asa merely passive organism is not easily forgotten by one who haswatched its display continued hour after hour without pause or sign ofweakening</s>  the possible complexity of many other organic formsseemingly as simple as the protoplasm of the nettle dawns upon one andthe comparison of such a protoplasm to a body with an internalcirculation which has been put forward by an eminent physiologistloses much of its startling character</s>  currents similar to those of thehairs of the nettle have been observed in a great multitude of verydifferent plants and weighty authorities have suggested that theyprobably occur in more or less perfection in all young vegetablecells</s>  if such be the case the wonderful noonday silence of a tropicalforest is after all due only to the dulness of our hearing and couldour ears catch the murmur of these tiny maelstroms as they whirl in theinnumerable myriads of living cells which constitute each tree weshould be stunned as with the roar of a great city</s> among the lower plants it is the rule rather than the exception thatcontractility should be still more openly manifested at some periods oftheir existence</s>  the protoplasm of alg and fungi becomes undermany circumstances partially or completely freed from its woodycase and exhibits movements of its whole mass or is propelled by thecontractility of one or more hairlike prolongations of its bodywhich are called vibratile cilia</s>  and so far as the conditions of themanifestation of the phnomena of contractility have yet been studiedthey are the same for the plant as for the animal</s>  heat and electricshocks influence both and in the same way though it may be indifferent degrees</s>  it is by no means my intention to suggest that thereis no difference in faculty between the lowest plant and the highest orbetween plants and animals</s>  but the difference between the powers of thelowest plant or animal and those of the highest is one of degree notof kind and depends as milneedwards long ago so well pointed outupon the extent to which the principle of the division of labour iscarried out in the living economy</s>  in the lowest organism all parts arecompetent to perform all functions and one and the same portion ofprotoplasm may successively take on the function of feeding moving orreproducing apparatus</s>  in the highest on the contrary a great numberof parts combine to perform each function each part doing its allottedshare of the work with great accuracy and efficiency but being uselessfor any other purpose</s> on the other hand notwithstanding all the fundamental resemblanceswhich exist between the powers of the protoplasm in plants and inanimals they present a striking difference to which i shall advertmore at length presently in the fact that plants can manufacture freshprotoplasm out of mineral compounds whereas animals are obliged toprocure it ready made and hence in the long run depend upon plants</s> upon what condition this difference in the powers of the two greatdivisions of the world of life depends nothing is at present known</s> with such qualification as arises out of the lastmentioned fact it maybe truly said that the acts of all living things are fundamentally one</s> is any such unity predicable of their forms</s>  let us seek in easilyverified facts for a reply to this question</s>  if a drop of blood be drawnby pricking ones finger and viewed with proper precautions and under asufficiently high microscopic power there will be seen among theinnumerable multitude of little circular discoidal bodies orcorpuscles which float in it and give it its colour a comparativelysmall number of colourless corpuscles of somewhat larger size and veryirregular shape</s>  if the drop of blood be kept at the temperature of thebody these colourless corpuscles will be seen to exhibit a marvellousactivity changing their forms with great rapidity drawing in andthrusting out prolongations of their substance and creeping about as ifthey were independent organisms</s> the substance which is thus active is a mass of protoplasm and itsactivity differs in detail rather than in principle from that of theprotoplasm of the nettle</s>  under sundry circumstances the corpuscle diesand becomes distended into a round mass in the midst of which is seen asmaller spherical body which existed but was more or less hidden inthe living corpuscle and is called its nucleus</s>  corpuscles ofessentially similar structure are to be found in the skin in the liningof the mouth and scattered through the whole framework of the body</s> nay more in the earliest condition of the human organism in thatstate in which it has but just become distinguishable from the egg inwhich it arises it is nothing but an aggregation of such corpusclesand every organ of the body was once no more than such an aggregation</s> thus a nucleated mass of protoplasm turns out to be what may be termedthe structural unit of the human body</s>  as a matter of fact the body inits earliest state is a mere multiple of such units and in itsperfect condition it is a multiple of such units variously modified</s> but does the formula which expresses the essential structural characterof the highest animal cover all the rest as the statement of its powersand faculties covered that of all others</s>  very nearly</s>  beast and fowlreptile and fish mollusk worm and polype are all composed ofstructural units of the same character namely masses of protoplasmwith a nucleus</s>  there are sundry very low animals each of whichstructurally is a mere colourless bloodcorpuscle leading anindependent life</s>  but at the very bottom of the animal scale even thissimplicity becomes simplified and all the phnomena of life aremanifested by a particle of protoplasm without a nucleus</s>  nor are suchorganisms insignificant by reason of their want of complexity</s>  it is afair question whether the protoplasm of those simplest forms of lifewhich people an immense extent of the bottom of the sea would notoutweigh that of all the higher living beings which inhabit the land puttogether</s>  and in ancient times no less than at the present day suchliving beings as these have been the greatest of rock builders</s> what has been said of the animal world is no less true of plants</s> imbedded in the protoplasm at the broad or attached end of the nettlehair there lies a spheroidal nucleus</s>  careful examination furtherproves that the whole substance of the nettle is made up of a repetitionof such masses of nucleated protoplasm each contained in a wooden casewhich is modified in form sometimes into a woody fibre sometimes intoa duct or spiral vessel sometimes into a pollen grain or an ovule</s> traced back to its earliest state the nettle arises as the man does ina particle of nucleated protoplasm</s>  and in the lowest plants as in thelowest animals a single mass of such protoplasm may constitute thewhole plant or the protoplasm may exist without a nucleus</s> under these circumstances it may well be asked how is one mass ofnonnucleated protoplasm to be distinguished from another</s>  why call oneplant and the other animal</s> the only reply is that so far as form is concerned plants and animalsare not separable and that in many cases it is a mere matter ofconvention whether we call a given organism an animal or a plant</s>  thereis a living body called thalium septicum which appears upon decayingvegetable substances and in one of its forms is common upon thesurfaces of tanpits</s>  in this condition it is to all intents andpurposes a fungus and formerly was always regarded as such but theremarkable investigations of de bary have shown that in anothercondition the thalium is an actively locomotive creature and takesin solid matters upon which apparently it feeds thus exhibiting themost characteristic feature of animality</s>  is this a plant or is it ananimal</s>  is it both or is it neither</s>  some decide in favour of the lastsupposition and establish an intermediate kingdom a sort of biologicalno mans land for all these questionable forms</s>  but as it is admittedlyimpossible to draw any distinct boundary line between this no mans landand the vegetable world on the one hand or the animal on the other itappears to me that this proceeding merely doubles the difficulty whichbefore was single</s> protoplasm simple or nucleated is the formal basis of all life</s>  it isthe clay of the potter which bake it and paint it as he will remainsclay separated by artifice and not by nature from the commonest brickor sundried clod</s> thus it becomes clear that all living powers are cognate and that allliving forms are fundamentally of one character</s>  the researches of thechemist have revealed a no less striking uniformity of materialcomposition in living matter</s> in perfect strictness it is true that chemical investigation can tellus little or nothing directly of the composition of living matterinasmuch as such matter must needs die in the act of analysisand uponthis very obvious ground objections which i confess seem to me to besomewhat frivolous have been raised to the drawing of any conclusionswhatever respecting the composition of actually living matter from thatof the dead matter of life which alone is accessible to us</s>  butobjectors of this class do not seem to reflect that it is also instrictness true that we know nothing about the composition of any bodywhatever as it is</s>  the statement that a crystal of calcspar consistsof carbonate of lime is quite true if we only mean that byappropriate processes it may be resolved into carbonic acid andquicklime</s>  if you pass the same carbonic acid over the very quicklimethus obtained you will obtain carbonate of lime again but it will notbe calcspar nor anything like it</s>  can it therefore be said thatchemical analysis teaches nothing about the chemical composition ofcalcspar</s>  such a statement would be absurd but it is hardly more sothan the talk one occasionally hears about the uselessness of applyingthe results of chemical analysis to the living bodies which have yieldedthem</s> one fact at any rate is out of reach of such refinements and this isthat all the forms of protoplasm which have yet been examined containthe four elements carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen in verycomplex union and that they behave similarly towards several reagents</s> to this complex combination the nature of which has never beendetermined with exactness the name of protein has been applied</s>  and ifwe use this term with such caution as may properly arise out of ourcomparative ignorance of the things for which it stands it may be trulysaid that all protoplasm is proteinaceous or as the white oralbumen of an egg is one of the commonest examples of a nearly pureprotein matter we may say that all living matter is more or lessalbuminoid</s> perhaps it would not yet be safe to say that all forms of protoplasm areaffected by the direct action of electric shocks and yet the number ofcases in which the contraction of protoplasm is shown to be effected bythis agency increases every day</s> nor can it be affirmed with perfect confidence that all forms ofprotoplasm are liable to undergo that peculiar coagulation at atemperature of 4050 centigrade which has been calledheatstiffening though khnes beautiful researches have proved thisoccurrence to take place in so many and such diverse living beings thatit is hardly rash to expect that the law holds good for all</s> enough has perhaps been said to prove the existence of a generaluniformity in the character of the protoplasm or physical basis oflife in whatever group of living beings it may be studied</s>  but it willbe understood that this general uniformity by no means excludes anyamount of special modifications of the fundamental substance</s>  themineral carbonate of lime assumes an immense diversity of charactersthough no one doubts that under all these protean changes it is oneand the same thing</s> and now what is the ultimate fate and what the origin of the matterof life</s> is it as some of the older naturalists supposed diffused throughoutthe universe in molecules which are indestructible and unchangeable inthemselves but in endless transmigration unite in innumerablepermutations into the diversified forms of life we know</s>  or is thematter of life composed of ordinary matter differing from it only inthe manner in which its atoms are aggregated</s>  is it built up of ordinarymatter and again resolved into ordinary matter when its work is done</s> modern science does not hesitate a moment between these alternatives</s> physiology writes over the portals of life  debemur morti nos nostraquewith a profounder meaning than the roman poet attached to thatmelancholy line</s>  under whatever disguise it takes refuge whether fungusor oak worm or man the living protoplasm not only ultimately dies andis resolved into its mineral and lifeless constituents but is alwaysdying and strange as the paradox may sound could not live unless itdied</s> in the wonderful story of the peau de chagrin the hero becomespossessed of a magical wild ass skin which yields him the means ofgratifying all his wishes</s>  but its surface represents the duration ofthe proprietors life and for every satisfied desire the skin shrinksin proportion to the intensity of fruition until at length life and thelast handbreadth of the peau de chagrin disappear with thegratification of a last wish</s> balzacs studies had led him over a wide range of thought andspeculation and his shadowing forth of physiological truth in thisstrange story may have been intentional</s>  at any rate the matter of lifeis a veritable peau de chagrin and for every vital act it is somewhatthe smaller</s>  all work implies waste and the work of life resultsdirectly or indirectly in the waste of protoplasm</s> every word uttered by a speaker costs him some physical loss and inthe strictest sense he burns that others may have lightso mucheloquence so much of his body resolved into carbonic acid water andurea</s>  it is clear that this process of expenditure cannot go on forever</s>  but happily the protoplasmic peau de chagrin differs frombalzacs in its capacity of being repaired and brought back to its fullsize after every exertion</s> for example this present lecture whatever its intellectual worth toyou has a certain physical value to me which is conceivablyexpressible by the number of grains of protoplasm and other bodilysubstance wasted in maintaining my vital processes during its delivery</s> my peau de chagrin will be distinctly smaller at the end of thediscourse than it was at the beginning</s>  by and by i shall probably haverecourse to the substance commonly called mutton for the purpose ofstretching it back to its original size</s>  now this mutton was once theliving protoplasm more or less modified of another animala sheep</s>  asi shall eat it it is the same matter altered not only by death but byexposure to sundry artificial operations in the process of cooking</s> but these changes whatever be their extent have not rendered itincompetent to resume its old functions as matter of life</s>  a singularinward laboratory which i possess will dissolve a certain portion ofthe modified protoplasm the solution so formed will pass into my veinsand the subtle influences to which it will then be subjected willconvert the dead protoplasm into living protoplasm and transubstantiatesheep into man</s> nor is this all</s>  if digestion were a thing to be trifled with i mightsup upon lobster and the matter of life of the crustacean would undergothe same wonderful metamorphosis into humanity</s>  and were i to return tomy own place by sea and undergo shipwreck the crustacea might andprobably would return the compliment and demonstrate our common natureby turning my protoplasm into living lobster</s>  or if nothing better wereto be had i might supply my wants with mere bread and i should findthe protoplasm of the wheatplant to be convertible into man with nomore trouble than that of the sheep and with far less i fancy thanthat of the lobster</s> hence it appears to be a matter of no great moment what animal or whatplant i lay under contribution for protoplasm and the fact speaksvolumes for the general identity of that substance in all living beings</s> i share this catholicity of assimilation with other animals all ofwhich so far as we know could thrive equally well on the protoplasm ofany of their fellows or of any plant but here the assimilative powersof the animal world cease</s>  a solution of smellingsalts in water withan infinitesimal proportion of some other saline matters contains allthe elementary bodies which enter into the composition of protoplasmbut as i need hardly say a hogshead of that fluid would not keep ahungry man from starving nor would it save any animal whatever from alike fate</s>  an animal cannot make protoplasm but must take it readymadefrom some other animal or some plantthe animals highest feat ofconstructive chemistry being to convert dead protoplasm into that livingmatter of life which is appropriate to itself</s> therefore in seeking for the origin of protoplasm we must eventuallyturn to the vegetable world</s>  the fluid containing carbonic acid waterand ammonia which offers such a barmecide feast to the animal is atable richly spread to multitudes of plants and with a due supply ofonly such materials many a plant will not only maintain itself invigour but grow and multiply until it has increased a millionfold ora million millionfold the quantity of protoplasm which it originallypossessed in this way building up the matter of life to an indefiniteextent from the common matter of the universe</s> thus the animal can only raise the complex substance of deadprotoplasm to the higher power as one may say of living protoplasmwhile the plant can raise the less complex substancescarbonic acidwater and ammoniato the same stage of living protoplasm if not tothe same level</s>  but the plant also has its limitations</s>  some of thefungi for example appear to need higher compounds to start with andno known plant can live upon the uncompounded elements of protoplasm</s>  aplant supplied with pure carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogenphosphorus sulphur and the like would as infallibly die as the animalin his bath of smellingsalts though it would be surrounded by all theconstituents of protoplasm</s>  nor indeed need the process ofsimplification of vegetable food be carried so far as this in order toarrive at the limit of the plants thaumaturgy</s>  let water carbonicacid and all the other needful constituents be supplied with ammoniaand an ordinary plant will still be unable to manufacture protoplasm</s> thus the matter of life so far as we know it and we have no right tospeculate on any other breaks up in consequence of that continualdeath which is the condition of its manifesting vitality into carbonicacid water and ammonia which certainly possess no properties butthose of ordinary matter</s>  and out of these same forms of ordinarymatter and from none which are simpler the vegetable world builds upall the protoplasm which keeps the animal world a going</s>  plants are theaccumulators of the power which animals distribute and disperse</s> but it will be observed that the existence of the matter of lifedepends on the preexistence of certain compounds namely carbonicacid water and ammonia</s>  withdraw any one of these three from theworld and all vital phnomena come to an end</s>  they are related to theprotoplasm of the plant as the protoplasm of the plant is to that ofthe animal</s>  carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen are all lifelessbodies</s>  of these carbon and oxygen unite in certain proportions andunder certain conditions to give rise to carbonic acid hydrogen andoxygen produce water nitrogen and hydrogen give rise to ammonia</s>  thesenew compounds like the elementary bodies of which they are composed arelifeless</s>  but when they are brought together under certain conditionsthey give rise to the still more complex body protoplasm and thisprotoplasm exhibits the phenomena of life</s> i see no break in this series of steps in molecular complication and iam unable to understand why the language which is applicable to any oneterm of the series may not be used to any of the others</s>  we think fit tocall different kinds of matter carbon oxygen hydrogen and nitrogenand to speak of the various powers and activities of these substances asthe properties of the matter of which they are composed</s> when hydrogen and oxygen are mixed in a certain proportion and anelectric spark is passed through them they disappear and a quantity ofwater equal in weight to the sum of their weights appears in theirplace</s>  there is not the slightest parity between the passive and activepowers of the water and those of the oxygen and hydrogen which havegiven rise to it</s>  at 32 fahrenheit and far below that temperatureoxygen and hydrogen are elastic gaseous bodies whose particles tend torush away from one another with great force</s>  water at the sametemperature is a strong though brittle solid whose particles tend tocohere into definite geometrical shapes and sometimes build up frostyimitations of the most complex forms of vegetable foliage</s> nevertheless we call these and many other strange phnomena theproperties of the water and we do not hesitate to believe that in someway or another they result from the properties of the componentelements of the water</s>  we do not assume that a something calledaquosity entered into and took possession of the oxide of hydrogen assoon as it was formed and then guided the aqueous particles to theirplaces in the facets of the crystal or amongst the leaflets of thehoarfrost</s>  on the contrary we live in the hope and in the faith thatby the advance of molecular physics we shall by and by be able to seeour way as clearly from the constituents of water to the properties ofwater as we are now able to deduce the operations of a watch from theform of its parts and the manner in which they are put together</s> is the case in any way changed when carbonic acid water and ammoniadisappear and in their place under the influence of preexistingliving protoplasm an equivalent weight of the matter of life makes itsappearance</s> it is true that there is no sort of parity between the properties of thecomponents and the properties of the resultant but neither was there inthe case of the water</s>  it is also true that what i have spoken of as theinfluence of preexisting living matter is something quiteunintelligible but does anybody quite comprehend the modus operandiof an electric spark which traverses a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen</s> what justification is there then for the assumption of the existencein the living matter of a something which has no representative orcorrelative in the not living matter which gave rise to it</s>  what betterphilosophical status has vitality than aquosity</s>  and why shouldvitality hope for a better fate than the other itys which havedisappeared since martinus scriblerus accounted for the operation of themeatjack by its inherent meat roasting quality and scorned thematerialism of those who explained the turning of the spit by acertain mechanism worked by the draught of the chimney</s> if scientific language is to possess a definite and constantsignification whenever it is employed it seems to me that we arelogically bound to apply to the protoplasm or physical basis of lifethe same conceptions as those which are held to be legitimate elsewhere</s> if the phnomena exhibited by water are its properties so are thosepresented by protoplasm living or dead its properties</s> if the properties of water may be properly said to result from thenature and disposition of its component molecules i can find nointelligible ground for refusing to say that the properties ofprotoplasm result from the nature and disposition of its molecules</s> but i bid you beware that in accepting these conclusions you areplacing your feet on the first rung of a ladder which in most peoplesestimation is the reverse of jacobs and leads to the antipodes ofheaven</s>  it may seem a small thing to admit that the dull vital actionsof a fungus or a foraminifer are the properties of their protoplasmand are the direct results of the nature of the matter of which theyare composed</s>  but if as i have endeavoured to prove to you theirprotoplasm is essentially identical with and most readily convertedinto that of any animal i can discover no logical haltingplacebetween the admission that such is the case and the further concessionthat all vital action may with equal propriety be said to be theresult of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it</s>  andif so it must be true in the same sense and to the same extent thatthe thoughts to which i am now giving utterance and your thoughtsregarding them are the expression of molecular changes in that matterof life which is the source of our other vital phnomena</s> past experience leads me to be tolerably certain that when thepropositions i have just placed before you are accessible to publiccomment and criticism they will be condemned by many zealous personsand perhaps by some few of the wise and thoughtful</s>  i should not wonderif gross and brutal materialism were the mildest phrase applied tothem in certain quarters</s>  and most undoubtedly the terms of thepropositions are distinctly materialistic</s>  nevertheless two things arecertain the one that i hold the statements to be substantially truethe other that i individually am no materialist but on thecontrary believe materialism to involve grave philosophical error</s> this union of materialistic terminology with the repudiation ofmaterialistic philosophy i share with some of the most thoughtful menwith whom i am acquainted</s>  and when i first undertook to deliver thepresent discourse it appeared to me to be a fitting opportunity toexplain how such a union is not only consistent with but necessitatedby sound logic</s>  i purposed to lead you through the territory of vitalphenomena to the materialistic slough in which you find yourselves nowplunged and then to point out to you the sole path by which in myjudgment extrication is possible</s> an occurrence of which i was unaware until my arrival here last nightrenders this line of argument singularly opportune</s>  i found in yourpapers the eloquent address on the limits of philosophical inquirywhich a distinguished prelate of the english church delivered before themembers of the philosophical institution on the previous day</s>  myargument also turns upon this very point of the limits ofphilosophical inquiry and i cannot bring out my own views better thanby contrasting them with those so plainly and in the main fairlystated by the archbishop of york</s> but i may be permitted to make a preliminary comment upon an occurrencethat greatly astonished me</s>  applying the name of the new philosophy tothat estimate of the limits of philosophical inquiry which i in commonwith many other men of science hold to be just the archbishop openshis address by identifying this new philosophy with the positivephilosophy of m</s>  comte of whom he speaks as its founder and thenproceeds to attack that philosopher and his doctrines vigorously</s> now so far as i am concerned the most reverend prelate mightdialectically hew m</s>  comte in pieces as a modern agag and i should notattempt to stay his hand</s>  in so far as my study of what speciallycharacterises the positive philosophy has led me i find therein littleor nothing of any scientific value and a great deal which is asthoroughly antagonistic to the very essence of science as anything inultramontane catholicism</s>  in fact m</s>  comtes philosophy in practicemight be compendiously described as catholicism minus christianity</s> but what has comtism to do with the new philosophy as the archbishopdefines it in the following passage</s>   let me briefly remind you of the leading principles of this new  philosophy</s>   all knowledge is experience of facts acquired by the senses</s>  the  traditions of older philosophies have obscured our experience by  mixing with it much that the senses cannot observe and until these  additions are discarded our knowledge is impure</s>  thus metaphysics  tell us that one fact which we observe is a cause and another is  the effect of that cause but upon a rigid analysis we find that  our senses observe nothing of cause or effect they observe first  that one fact succeeds another and after some opportunity that  this fact has never failed to followthat for cause and effect we  should substitute invariable succession</s>  an older philosophy  teaches us to define an object by distinguishing its essential from  its accidental qualities but experience knows nothing of essential  and accidental she sees only that certain marks attach to an  object and after many observations that some of them attach  invariably whilst others may at times be absent</s> </s> </s> </s>  as all  knowledge is relative the notion of anything being necessary must  be banished with other traditions</s> 11there is much here that expresses the spirit of the new philosophy ifby that term be meant the spirit of modern science but i cannot butmarvel that the assembled wisdom and learning of edinburgh should haveuttered no sign of dissent when comte was declared to be the founder ofthese doctrines</s>  no one will accuse scotchmen of habitually forgettingtheir great countrymen but it was enough to make david hume turn inhis grave that here almost within earshot of his house an instructedaudience should have listened without a murmur while his mostcharacteristic doctrines were attributed to a french writer of fiftyyears later date in whose dreary and verbose pages we miss alike thevigour of thought and the exquisite clearness of style of the man whom imake bold to term the most acute thinker of the eighteenth centuryeventhough that century produced kant</s> but i did not come to scotland to vindicate the honour of one of thegreatest men she has ever produced</s>  my business is to point out to youthat the only way of escape out of the crass materialism in which wejust now landed is the adoption and strict workingout of the veryprinciples which the archbishop holds up to reprobation</s> let us suppose that knowledge is absolute and not relative andtherefore that our conception of matter represents that which it reallyis</s>  let us suppose further that we do know more of cause and effectthan a certain definite order of succession among facts and that wehave a knowledge of the necessity of that successionand hence ofnecessary lawsand i for my part do not see what escape there is fromutter materialism and necessarianism</s>  for it is obvious that ourknowledge of what we call the material world is to begin with atleast as certain and definite as that of the spiritual world and thatour acquaintance with law is of as old a date as our knowledge ofspontaneity</s>  further i take it to be demonstrable that it is utterlyimpossible to prove that anything whatever may not be the effect of amaterial and necessary cause and that human logic is equallyincompetent to prove that any act is really spontaneous</s>  a reallyspontaneous act is one which by the assumption has no cause and theattempt to prove such a negative as this is on the face of the matterabsurd</s>  and while it is thus a philosophical impossibility todemonstrate that any given phnomenon is not the effect of a materialcause any one who is acquainted with the history of science will admitthat its progress has in all ages meant and now more than evermeans the extension of the province of what we call matter andcausation and the concomitant gradual banishment from all regions ofhuman thought of what we call spirit and spontaneity</s> i have endeavoured in the first part of this discourse to give you aconception of the direction towards which modern physiology is tendingand i ask you what is the difference between the conception of life asthe product of a certain disposition of material molecules and the oldnotion of an archus governing and directing blind matter within eachliving body except thisthat here as elsewhere matter and law havedevoured spirit and spontaneity</s>  and as surely as every future grows outof past and present so will the physiology of the future graduallyextend the realm of matter and law until it is coextensive withknowledge with feeling and with action</s> the consciousness of this great truth weighs like a nightmare ibelieve upon many of the best minds of these days</s>  they watch what theyconceive to be the progress of materialism in such fear and powerlessanger as a savage feels when during an eclipse the great shadowcreeps over the face of the sun</s>  the advancing tide of matter threatensto drown their souls the tightening grasp of law impedes their freedomthey are alarmed lest mans moral nature be debased by the increase ofhis wisdom</s> if the new philosophy be worthy of the reprobation with which it isvisited i confess their fears seem to me to be well founded</s>  while onthe contrary could david hume be consulted i think he would smile attheir perplexities and chide them for doing even as the heathen andfalling down in terror before the hideous idols their own hands haveraised</s> for after all what do we know of this terrible matter except as aname for the unknown and hypothetical cause of states of our ownconsciousness</s>  and what do we know of that spirit over whosethreatened extinction by matter a great lamentation is arising likethat which was heard at the death of pan except that it is also a namefor an unknown and hypothetical cause or condition of states ofconsciousness</s>  in other words matter and spirit are but names for theimaginary substrata of groups of natural phnomena</s> and what is the dire necessity and iron law under which men groan</s> truly most gratuitously invented bugbears</s>  i suppose if there be aniron law it is that of gravitation and if there be a physicalnecessity it is that a stone unsupported must fall to the ground</s>  butwhat is all we really know and can know about the latter phnomenon</s> simply that in all human experience stones have fallen to the groundunder these conditions that we have not the smallest reason forbelieving that any stone so circumstanced will not fall to the groundand that we have on the contrary every reason to believe that it willso fall</s>  it is very convenient to indicate that all the conditions ofbelief have been fulfilled in this case by calling the statement thatunsupported stones will fall to the ground a law of nature</s>  but whenas commonly happens we change will into must we introduce an ideaof necessity which most assuredly does not lie in the observed factsand has no warranty that i can discover elsewhere</s>  for my part iutterly repudiate and anathematize the intruder</s>  fact i know and law iknow but what is this necessity save an empty shadow of my own mindsthrowing</s> but if it is certain that we can have no knowledge of the nature ofeither matter or spirit and that the notion of necessity is somethingillegitimately thrust into the perfectly legitimate conception of lawthe materialistic position that there is nothing in the world butmatter force and necessity is as utterly devoid of justification asthe most baseless of theological dogmas</s>  the fundamental doctrines ofmaterialism like those of spiritualism and most other isms lieoutside the limits of philosophical inquiry and david humes greatservice to humanity is his irrefragable demonstration of what theselimits are</s>  hume called himself a sceptic and therefore others cannotbe blamed if they apply the same title to him but that does not alterthe fact that the name with its existing implications does him grossinjustice</s> if a man asks me what the politics of the inhabitants of the moon areand i reply that i do not know that neither i nor any one else haveany means of knowing and that under these circumstances i decline totrouble myself about the subject at all i do not think he has anyright to call me a sceptic</s>  on the contrary in replying thus iconceive that i am simply honest and truthful and show a proper regardfor the economy of time</s>  so humes strong and subtle intellect takes upa great many problems about which we are naturally curious and shows usthat they are essentially questions of lunar politics in their essenceincapable of being answered and therefore not worth the attention ofmen who have work to do in the world</s>  and he thus ends one of hisessays  if we take in hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics  for instance let us ask does it contain any abstract reasoning  concerning quantity or number</s>  no</s>  does it contain any  experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence</s>   no</s>  commit it then to the flames for it can contain nothing but  sophistry and illusion</s> 12permit me to enforce this most wise advice</s>  why trouble ourselves aboutmatters of which however important they may be we do know nothing andcan know nothing</s>  we live in a world which is full of misery andignorance and the plain duty of each and all of us is to try to makethe little corner he can influence somewhat less miserable and somewhatless ignorant than it was before he entered it</s>  to do this effectuallyit is necessary to be fully possessed of only two beliefs the firstthat the order of nature is ascertainable by our faculties to an extentwhich is practically unlimited the second that our volition counts forsomething as a condition of the course of events</s> each of these beliefs can be verified experimentally as often as welike to try</s>  each therefore stands upon the strongest foundation uponwhich any belief can rest and forms one of our highest truths</s>  if wefind that the ascertainment of the order of nature is facilitated byusing one terminology or one set of symbols rather than another it isour clear duty to use the former and no harm can accrue so long as webear in mind that we are dealing merely with terms and symbols</s> in itself it is of little moment whether we express the phnomena ofmatter in terms of spirit or the phnomena of spirit in terms ofmatter matter may be regarded as a form of thought thought may beregarded as a property of mattereach statement has a certain relativetruth</s>  but with a view to the progress of science the materialisticterminology is in every way to be preferred</s>  for it connects thoughtwith the other phnomena of the universe and suggests inquiry into thenature of those physical conditions or concomitants of thought whichare more or less accessible to us and a knowledge of which may infuture help us to exercise the same kind of control over the world ofthought as we already possess in respect of the material worldwhereas the alternative or spiritualistic terminology is utterlybarren and leads to nothing but obscurity and confusion of ideas</s> thus there can be little doubt that the further science advances themore extensively and consistently will all the phnomena of nature berepresented by materialistic formul and symbols</s> but the man of science who forgetting the limits of philosophicalinquiry slides from these formul and symbols into what is commonlyunderstood by materialism seems to me to place himself on a level withthe mathematician who should mistake the xs and ys with which heworks his problems for real entitiesand with this furtherdisadvantage as compared with the mathematician that the blunders ofthe latter are of no practical consequence while the errors ofsystematic materialism may paralyse the energies and destroy the beautyof a life</s>

or lesscoexisted with the theological from the dawn of human intelligence</s> and by way of completing the series of contradictions the assertionthat the three states are essentially different and even radicallyopposed is met a little lower on the same page by the declaration thatthe metaphysical state is at bottom nothing but a simple generalmodification of the first while in the fortieth leon

21i leave m</s>  cointes disciples to settle which of these contradictorystatements expresses their masters real meaning</s>  all i beg leave toremark is that men of science are not in the habit of paying muchattention to laws stated in this fashion</s> the second statement is undoubtedly far more rational and consistentwith fact than the first but i cannot think it is a just or adequateaccount of the growth of intelligence either in the individual man orin the human species</s>  any one who will carefully watch the developmentof the intellect of a child will perceive that from the first its mindis mirroring nature in two different ways</s>  on the one hand it is merelydrinking in sensations and building up associations while it formsconceptions of things and their relations which are more thoroughlypositive or devoid of entanglement with hypotheses of any kind thanthey will ever be in afterlife</s>  no child has recourse to imaginarypersonifications in order to account for the ordinary properties ofobjects which are not alive or do not represent living things</s>  it doesnot imagine that the taste of sugar is brought about by a god ofsweetness or that a spirit of jumping causes a ball to bound</s>  suchphnomena which form the basis of a very large part of its ideas aretaken as matters of courseas ultimate facts which suggest nodifficulty and need no explanation</s>  so far as all these common thoughimportant phnomena are concerned the childs mind is in what m</s>  comtewould call the positive state</s> but side by side with this mental condition there rises another</s>  thechild becomes aware of itself as a source of action and a subject ofpassion and of thought</s>  the acts which follow upon its own desires areamong the most interesting and prominent of surrounding occurrences andthese acts again plainly arise either out of affections caused bysurrounding things or of other changes in itself</s>  among thesesurrounding things the most interesting and important are mother andfather brethren and nurses</s>  the hypothesis that these wonderfulcreatures are of like nature to itself is speedily forced upon thechilds mind and this primitive piece of anthropomorphism turns out tobe a highly successful speculation which finds its justification atevery turn</s>  no wonder then that it is extended to other similarlyinteresting objects which are not too unlike theseto the dog the catand the canary the doll the toy and the picturebookthat these areendowed with wills and affections and with capacities for being goodand naughty</s>  but surely it would be a mere perversion of language tocall this a theological state of mind either in the proper sense ofthe word theological or as contrasted with scientific orpositive</s>  the child does not worship either father or mother dog ordoll</s>  on the contrary nothing is more curious than the absoluteirreverence if i may so say of a kindlytreated young child itstendency to believe in itself as the centre of the universe and itsdisposition to exercise despotic tyranny over those who could crush itwith a finger</s> still less is there anything unscientific or antiscientific in thisinfantile anthropomorphism</s>  the child observes that many phnomena arethe consequences of affections of itself it soon has excellent reasonsfor the belief that many other phnomena are consequences of theaffections of other beings more or less like itself</s>  and having thusgood evidence for believing that many of the most interestingoccurrences about it are explicable on the hypothesis that they are thework of intelligences like itselfhaving discovered a vera causa formany phnomenawhy should the child limit the application of sofruitful an hypothesis</s>  the dog has a sort of intelligence so has thecat why should not the doll and the picturebook also have a shareproportioned to their likeness to intelligent things</s> the only limit which does arise is exactly that which as a matter ofscience should arise that is to say the anthropomorphicinterpretation is applied only to those phnomena which in theirgeneral nature or their apparent capriciousness resemble those whichthe child observes to be caused by itself or by beings like itself</s>  allthe rest are regarded as things which explain themselves or areinexplicable</s> it is only at a later stage of intellectual development that theintelligence of man awakes to the apparent conflict between theanthropomorphic and what i may call the physical22 aspect ofnature and either endeavours to extend the anthropomorphic view overthe whole of naturewhich is the tendency of theology or to give thesame exclusive predominance to the physical viewwhich is the tendencyof science or adopts a middle course and taking from theanthropomorphic view its tendency to personify and from the physicalview its tendency to exclude volition and affection ends in what m</s> comte calls the metaphysical statemetaphysical in m</s>

outoftheway events which is its concomitant</s> witchcraft and sorcery are the practical expressions of these beliefsand they stand in the same relation to religious worship as the simpleanthropomorphism of children or savages does to theology</s> in the progress of the species from savagery to advanced civilizationanthropomorphism grows into theology while physicism if i may so callit develops into science but the development of the two iscontemporaneous not successive</s>  for each there long exists an assuredprovince which is not invaded by the other while between the two

speculativeproblemsdoes human nature possess any free volitional or trulyanthropomorphic element or is it only the cunningest of all naturesclocks</s>  some among whom i count myself think that the battle will forever remain a drawn one and that for all practical purposes thisresult is as good as anthropomorphism winning the day</s> the classification of the sciences which in the eyes of m</s>  comtesadherents constitutes his second great claim to the dignity of ascientific philosopher appears to me to be open to just the sameobjections as the law of the three states</s>  it is inconsistent in itselfand it is inconsistent with fact</s>
 let us consider the main points ofthis classification successively  il faut distinguer par rapport  tous les ordres des phnomnes  deux genres de sciences naturelles les unes abstraites  gnrales ont pour objet la dcouverte des lois qui rgissent les  diverses classes de phnomnes en considrant tous les cas quon  peut concevoir les autres concrtes particulires descriptives  et quon dsigne quelquefois sous le nom des sciences naturelles  proprement dites consistent dans lapplication de ces lois   lhistoire effective des diffrents tres existants</s> 23the abstract sciences are subsequently said to be mathematicsastronomy physics chemistry physiology and social physicsthetitles of the two latter being subsequently changed to biology andsociology</s>  m</s>  comte exemplifies the distinction between his abstract andhis concrete sciences as follows  on pourra dabord lapercevoir trsnettement en comparant dune  part la physiologie gnrale et dune autre part la zoologie et  la botanique proprement dites</s>  ce sont videmment en effet deux  travaux dun caractre fort distinct que dtudier en gnral  les lois de la vie ou de dterminer le mode dexistence de chaque  corps vivant en particulier</s>  cette seconde tude en outre est  ncessairememt fonde sur la premire</s>
p</s>  57</s> all the unreality and mere bookishness of m</s>  comtes knowledge ofphysical science comes out in the passage i have italicised</s>  thespecial study of living beings is based upon a general study of the lawsof life</s>  what little i know about the matter leads me to think thatif m</s>  comte had possessed the slightest practical acquaintance withbiological science he would have turned his phraseology upside downand have perceived that we can have no knowledge of the general laws oflife except that which is based upon the study of particular livingbeings</s> the illustration is surely unluckily chosen but the language in whichthese socalled abstract sciences are defined seems to me to be stillmore open to criticism</s>  with what propriety can astronomy or physicsor chemistry or biology be said to occupy themselves with theconsideration of all conceivable cases which fall within theirrespective provinces</s>  does the astronomer occupy himself with any othersystem of the universe than that which is visible to him</s>  does hespeculate upon the possible movements of bodies which may attract oneanother in the inverse proportion of the cube of their distances say</s> does biology whether abstract or concrete occupy itself with anyother form of life than those which exist or have existed</s>  and if theabstract sciences embrace all conceivable cases of the operation of thelaws with which they are concerned would not they necessarily embracethe subjects of the concrete sciences which inasmuch as they existmust needs be conceivable</s>  in fact no such distinction as that which m</s> comte draws is tenable</s>  the first stage of his classification breaks byits own weight</s> but granting m</s>  comte his six abstract sciences he proceeds to arrangethem according to what he calls their natural order or hierarchy theirplaces in this hierarchy being determined by the degree of generalityand simplicity of the conceptions with which they deal</s>  mathematicsoccupies the first astronomy the second physics the third chemistrythe fourth biology the fifth and sociology the sixth and last place inthe series</s>  m</s>  comtes arguments in favour of this classification arefirst  sa conformit essentielle avec la coordination en quelque sorte  spontane qui se trouve en effet implicitement admise par les  savants livrs  ltude des diverse branches de la philosophie  naturelle</s> but i absolutely deny the existence of this conformity</s>  if there is onething clear about the progress of modern science it is the tendency toreduce all scientific problems except those which are purelymathematical to questions of molecular physicsthat is to say to theattractions repulsions motions and coordination of the ultimateparticles of matter</s>  social phnomena are the result of the interactionof the components of society or men with one another and thesurrounding universe</s>  but in the language of physical science whichby the nature of the case is materialistic the actions of men so faras they are recognisable by science are the results of molecularchanges in the matter of which they are composed and in the long runthese must come into the hands of the physicist</s>  a fortiori thephnomena of biology and of chemistry are in their ultimate analysisquestions of molecular physics</s>  indeed the fact is acknowledged by allchemists and biologists who look beyond their immediate occupations</s>  andit is to be observed that the phnomena of biology are as directly andimmediately connected with molecular physics as are those of chemistry</s> molar physics chemistry and biology are not three successive steps inthe ladder of knowledge as m</s>  comte would have us believe but threebranches springing from the common stem of molecular physics</s> as to astronomy i am at a loss to understand how any one who will givea moments attention to the nature of the science can fail to see thatit consists of two parts first of a description of the phnomenawhich is as much entitled as descriptive zoology or botany is to thename of natural history and secondly of an explanation of thephnomena furnished by the laws of a forcegravitationthe study ofwhich is as much a part of physics as is that of heat or electricity</s> it would be just as reasonable to make the study of the heat of the suna science preliminary to the rest of thermotics as to place the studyof the attraction of the bodies which compose the universe in generalbefore that of the particular terrestrial bodies which alone we canexperimentally know</s>  astronomy in fact owes its perfection to thecircumstance that it is the only branch of natural history thephnomena of which are largely expressible by mathematical conceptionsand which can be to a great extent explained by the application ofvery simple physical laws</s> with regard to mathematics it is to be observed in the first placethat m</s>  comte mixes up under that head the pure relations of space andof quantity which are properly included under the name with rationalmechanics and statics which are mathematical developments of the mostgeneral conceptions of physics namely the notions of force and ofmotion</s>  relegating these to their proper place in physics we have leftpure mathematics which can stand neither at the head nor at the tailof any hierarchy of the sciences since like logic it is equallyrelated to all though the enormous practical difficulty of applyingmathematics to the more complex phnomena of nature removes them forthe present out of its sphere</s> on this subject of mathematics again m</s>  comte indulges in assertionswhich can only be accounted for by his total ignorance of physicalscience practically</s>
 as for example  cest donc par ltude des mathmatiques et seulement par elle  que lon peut se faire une ide juste et approfondie de ce que  cest quune science</s>  cest l uniquement quon doit chercher   connatre avec prcision la mthode gnrale que lesprit humain  emploie constamment dans toutes ses recherches positives parce  que nulle part ailleurs les questions ne sont rsolues dune  manire aussi

the only study which can confer a just andcomprehensive idea of what is meant by science and at the same timefurnish an exact conception of the general method of scientificinvestigation is that which knows nothing of observation nothing ofexperiment nothing of induction nothing of causation</s>  and educationthe whole secret of which consists in proceeding from the easy to thedifficult the concrete to the abstract ought to be turned the otherway and pass from the abstract to the concrete</s> m</s>  comte puts a second argument in favour of his hierarchy of thesciences thus  un second caractre trsessentiel de notre classification cest  dtre ncessairement conforme  lordre effectif du dveloppement  de la philosophie naturelle</s>  cest ce que vrifie tout ce quon  sait de lhistoire des sciences</s> 25but mr</s>  spencer has so thoroughly and completely demonstrated theabsence of any correspondence between the historical development of thesciences and their position in the comtean hierarchy in his essay onthe genesis of science that i shall not waste time in repeating hisrefutation</s> a third proposition in support of the comtean classification of thesciences stands as follows  en troisime lieu cette classification prsente la proprit  trsremarquable de marquer exactement la perfection relative des  diffrentes sciences laquelle consiste essentiellement dans le  degr de prcision des connaissances et dans leur coordination  plus ou moins intime</s> 26i am quite unable to understand the distinction which m</s>  comteendeavours to draw in this passage in spite of his amplificationsfurther on</s>  every science must consist of precise knowledge and thatknowledge must be coordinated into general proportions or it is notscience</s>  when m</s>  comte in exemplification of the statement i havecited says that les phnomnes organiques ne comportent quune tude la fois moins exacte et moins systmatique que les phnomnes des corpsbruts i am at a loss to comprehend what he means</s>  if i affirm thatwhen a motor nerve is irritated the muscle connected with it becomessimultaneously shorter and thicker without changing its volume itappears to me that the statement is as precise or exact and not merelyas true as that of the physicist who should say that when a piece ofiron is heated it becomes simultaneously longer and thicker andincreases in volume nor can i discover any difference in point ofprecision between the statement of the morphological law that animalswhich suckle their young have two occipital condyles and theenunciation of the physical law that water subjected to electrolysisis replaced by an equal weight of the gases oxygen and hydrogen</s>  asfor anatomical or physiological investigation being less systematicthan that of the physicist or chemist the assertion is simplyunaccountable</s>  the methods of physical science are everywhere the samein principle and the physiological investigator who was notsystematic would on the whole break down rather sooner than theinquirer into simpler subjects</s> thus m</s>  comtes classification of the sciences under all its aspectsappears to me to be a complete failure</s>  it is impossible in an articlewhich is already too long to inquire how it may be replaced by abetter and it is the less necessary to do so as a second edition ofmr</s>  spencers remarkable essay on this subject has just been published</s> after wading through pages of the longwinded confusion and secondhandinformation of the philosophic positive at the risk of a crisecrbraleit is as good as a showerbath to turn to theclassification of the sciences and refresh oneself with mr</s>  spencersprofound thought precise knowledge and clear language</s> ii</s>  the second proposition to which i have committed myself in thepaper to which i have been obliged to refer so often is that thepositive philosophy contains a great deal which is as thoroughlyantagonistic to the very essence of science as is anything inultramontane catholicism</s> what i refer to in these words is on the one hand the dogmatism andnarrowness which so often mark m</s>  comtes discussion of doctrines whichhe does not like and reduce his expressions of opinion to merepassionate puerilities as for example when he is arguing against theassumption of an ether or when he is talking i cannot call it arguingagainst psychology or political economy</s>  on the other hand i allude tothe spirit of meddling systematization and regulation which animateseven the philosophic positive and breaks out in the latter volumesof that work into no uncertain foreshadowing of the antiscientificmonstrosities of comtes later writings</s> those who try to draw a line of demarcation between the spirit of thephilosophic positive and that of the politique and its successorsif i may express an opinion from fragmentary knowledge of these lastmust have overlooked or forgotten what comte himself labours to showand indeed succeeds in proving in the appendice gnral of thepolitique positive</s>  ds mon dbut he writes je tentai de fonderle nouveau pouvoir spirituel que jinstitue aujourdhui</s>  ma politiqueloin dtre aucunement oppose  ma philosophie en constitue tellementla suite naturelle que celleci fut directement institue pour servir debase  cellel comme le prouve cet appendice</s> 27this is quite true</s>  in the remarkable essay entitled considrations surle pouvoir spirituel published in march 1826 comte advocates theestablishment of a modern spiritual power which he anticipates mayexercise an even greater influence over temporal affairs than did thecatholic clergy at the height of their vigour and independence in thetwelfth century</s>  this spiritual power is in fact to govern opinionand to have the supreme control over education in each nation of thewest and the spiritual powers of the several european peoples are to beassociated together and placed under a common direction or souverainetspirituelle</s> a system of catholicism minus christianity was therefore completelyorganized in comtes mind four years before the first volume of thephilosophie positive was written and naturally the papal spiritshows itself in that work not only in the ways i have alreadymentioned but notably in the attack on liberty of conscience whichbreaks out in the fourth volume  il ny a point de libert de conscience en astronomie en  physique en chimie en physiologie mme en ce sens que chacun  trouverait absurde de ne pas croire de confiance aux principes  tablis dans les sciences par les hommes comptents</s> nothing in ultramontane catholicism can in my judgment be morecompletely sacerdotal more entirely antiscientific than this dictum</s> all the great steps in the advancement of science have been made by justthose men who have not hesitated to doubt the principles established inthe sciences by competent persons and the great teaching ofsciencethe great use of it as an instrument of mental disciplineisits constant inculcation of the maxim that the sole ground on which anystatement has a right to be believed is the impossibility of refutingit</s> thus without travelling beyond the limits of the philosophiepositive we find its author contemplating the establishment of asystem of society in which an organized spiritual power shall overrideand direct the temporal power as completely as the innocents andgregorys tried to govern europe in the middle ages and repudiating theexercise of liberty of conscience against the hommes comptents ofwhom by the assumption the new priesthood would be composed</s>  was mr</s> congreve as forgetful of this as he seems to have been of some otherparts of the philosophie positive when he wrote that in anylimited careful use of the term no candid man could say that thepositive philosophy contained a great deal as thoroughly antagonistic tothe very essence of28 science as catholicism</s> m</s>  comte it will

soon find themselves at work in thatwhite substance almost too soft to be called rock with which we are allfamiliar as chalk</s> not only here but over the whole county of norfolk the wellsinkermight carry his shaft down many hundred feet without coming to the endof the chalk and on the seacoast where the waves have pared away theface of the land which breasts them the scarped faces of the highcliffs are often wholly formed of the same material</s>  northward thechalk may be followed as far as yorkshire on the south coast it appearsabruptly in the picturesque western bays of dorset and breaks into theneedles of the isle of wight while on the shores of kent it suppliesthat long line of white cliffs to which england owes her name of albion</s> were the thin soil which covers it all washed away a curved band ofwhite chalk here broader and there narrower might be followeddiagonally across england from lulworth in dorset to flamborough headin yorkshirea distance of over 280 miles as the crow flies</s> from this band to the north sea on the east and the channel on thesouth the chalk is largely hidden by other deposits but except in theweald of kent and sussex it enters into the very foundation of all thesoutheastern counties</s> attaining as it does in some places a thickness of more than athousand feet the english chalk must be admitted to be a mass ofconsiderable magnitude</s>  nevertheless it covers but an insignificantportion of the whole area occupied by the chalk formation of the globewhich has precisely the same general characters as ours and is found indetached patches some less and others more extensive than theenglish</s> chalk occurs in northwest ireland it stretches over a large part offrancethe chalk which underlies paris being in fact a continuationof that of the london basin it runs through denmark and central europeand extends southward to north africa while eastward it appears inthe crimea and in syria and may be traced as far as the shores of thesea of aral in central asia</s> if all the points at which true chalk occurs were circumscribed theywould lie within an irregular oval about 3000 miles in longdiameterthe area of which would be as great as that of europe andwould many times exceed that of the largest existing inland seathemediterranean</s> thus the chalk is no unimportant element in the masonry of the earthscrust and it impresses a peculiar stamp varying with the conditionsto which it is exposed on the scenery of the districts in which itoccurs</s>  the undulating downs and rounded coombs covered withsweetgrassed turf of our inland chalk country have a peacefullydomestic and muttonsuggesting prettiness but can hardly be calledeither grand or beautiful</s>  but on our southern coasts the wallsidedcliffs many hundred feet high with vast needles and pinnacles standingout in the sea sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for thewary cormorant confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur

surface of the earth</s>  andwhence did it come</s> you may think this no very hopeful inquiry</s>  you may not unnaturallysuppose that the attempt to solve such problems as these can lead to noresult save that of entangling the inquirer in vague speculationsincapable of refutation and of verification</s> if such were really the case i should have selected some other subjectthan a piece of chalk for my discourse</s>  but in truth after muchdeliberation i have been unable to think of any topic which would sowell enable me to lead you to see how solid is the foundation upon whichsome of the most startling conclusions of physical science rest</s> a great chapter of the history of the world is written in the chalk</s>  fewpassages in the history of man can be supported by such an overwhelmingmass of direct and indirect evidence as that which testifies to thetruth of the fragment of the history of the globe which i hope toenable you to read with your own eyes tonight</s> let me add that few chapters of human history have a more profoundsignificance for ourselves</s>  i weigh my words well when i assert thatthe man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which everycarpenter carries about in his breechespocket though ignorant of allother history is likely if he will think his knowledge out to itsultimate results to have a truer and therefore a better conception ofthis wonderful universe and of mans relation to it than the mostlearned student who is deepread in the records of humanity and ignorantof those of nature</s> the language of the chalk is not hard to learn not nearly so hard aslatin if you only want to get at the broad features of the story it hasto tell and i propose that we now set to work to spell that story outtogether</s> we all know that if we burn chalk the result is quicklime</s>  chalk infact is a compound of carbonic acid gas and lime and when you make itvery hot the carbonic acid flies away and the lime is left</s> by this method of procedure we see the lime but we do not see thecarbonic acid</s>  if on the other hand you were to powder a little chalkand drop it into a good deal of strong vinegar there would be a greatbubbling and fizzing and finally a clear liquid in which no sign ofchalk would appear</s>  here you see the carbonic acid in the bubbles thelime dissolved in the vinegar vanishes from sight</s>  there are a greatmany other ways of showing that chalk is essentially nothing butcarbonic acid and quicklime</s>  chemists enunciate the result of all theexperiments which prove this by stating that chalk is almost whollycomposed of carbonate of lime</s> it is desirable for us to start from the knowledge of this fact thoughit may not seem to help us very far towards what we seek</s>  for carbonateof lime is a widelyspread substance and is met with under very variousconditions</s>  all sorts of limestones are composed of more or less purecarbonate of lime</s>  the crust which is often deposited by waters whichhave drained through limestone rocks in the form of what are calledstalagmites and stalactites is carbonate of lime</s>  or to take a morefamiliar example the fur on the inside of a teakettle is carbonate oflime and for anything chemistry tells us to the contrary the chalkmight be a kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of the earthkettlewhich is kept pretty hot below</s> let us try another method of making the chalk tell us its own history</s> to the unassisted eye chalk looks simply like a very loose and open kindof stone</s>  but it is possible to grind a slice of chalk down so thin thatyou can see through ituntil it is thin enough in fact to be examinedwith any magnifying power that may be thought desirable</s>  a thin slice ofthe fur of a kettle might be made in the same way</s>  if it were examinedmicroscopically it would show itself to be a more or less distinctlylaminated mineral substance and nothing more</s> but the slice of chalk presents a totally different appearance whenplaced under the microscope</s>  the general mass of it is made up of veryminute granules but imbedded in this matrix are innumerable bodiessome smaller and some larger but on a rough average not more than ahundredth of an inch in diameter having a welldefined shape andstructure</s>  a cubic inch of some specimens of chalk may contain hundredsof thousands of these bodies compacted together with incalculablemillions of the granules</s> the examination of a transparent slice gives a good notion of the mannerin which the components of the chalk are arranged and of their relativeproportions</s>  but by rubbing up some chalk with a brush in water andthen pouring off the milky fluid so as to obtain sediments of differentdegrees of fineness the granules and the minute rounded bodies may bepretty well separated from one another and submitted to microscopicexamination either as opaque or as transparent objects</s>  by combiningthe views obtained in these various methods each of the rounded bodiesmay be proved to be a beautifullyconstructed calcareous fabric made upof a number of chambers communicating freely with one another</s>  thechambered bodies are of various forms</s>  one of the commonest is somethinglike a badlygrown raspberry being formed of a number of nearlyglobular chambers of different sizes congregated together</s>  it is calledglobigerina and some specimens of chalk consist of little else thanglobigerin and granules</s> let us fix our attention upon the globigerina</s>  it is the spoor of thegame we are tracking</s>  if we can learn what it is and what are theconditions of its existence we shall see our way to the origin and pasthistory of the chalk</s> a suggestion which may naturally enough present itself is that thesecurious bodies are the result of some process of aggregation which hastaken place in the carbonate of lime that just as in winter the rimeon our windows simulates the most delicate and elegantly arborescentfoliageproving that the mere mineral water may under certainconditions assume the outward form of organic bodiesso this mineralsubstance carbonate of lime hidden away in the bowels of the earthhas taken the shape of these chambered bodies</s>  i am not raising a merelyfanciful and unreal objection</s>  very learned men in former days haveeven entertained the notion that all the formed things found in rocksare of this nature and if no such conception is at present held to beadmissible it is because long and varied experience has now shown thatmineral matter never does assume the form and structure we find infossils</s>  if any one were to try to persuade you that an oystershellwhich is also chiefly composed of carbonate of lime had crystallizedout of seawater i suppose you would laugh at the absurdity</s>  yourlaughter would be justified by the fact that all experience tends toshow that oystershells are formed by the agency of oysters and in noother way</s>  and if there were no better reasons we should be justifiedon like grounds in believing that globigerina is not the product ofanything but vital activity</s> happily however better evidence in proof of the organic nature of theglobigerin than that of analogy is forthcoming</s>  it so happens thatcalcareous skeletons exactly similar to the globigerin of the chalkare being formed at the present moment by minute living creatureswhich flourish in multitudes literally more numerous than the sands ofthe seashore over a large extent of that part of the earths surfacewhich is covered by the ocean</s> the history of the discovery of these living globigerin and of thepart which they play in rockbuilding is singular enough</s>  it is adiscovery which like others of no less scientific importance hasarisen incidentally out of work devoted to very different andexceedingly practical interests</s> when men first took to the sea they speedily learned to look out forshoals and rocks and the more the burthen of their ships increased themore imperatively necessary it became for sailors to ascertain withprecision the depth of the waters they traversed</s>  out of this necessitygrew the use of the lead and soundingline and ultimatelymarinesurveying which is the recording of the form of coasts and ofthe depth of the sea as ascertained by the soundinglead upon charts</s> at the same time it became desirable to ascertain and to indicate thenature of the seabottom since this circumstance greatly affects itsgoodness as holding ground for anchors</s>  some ingenious tar whose namedeserves a better fate than the oblivion into which it has fallenattained this object by arming the bottom of the lead with a lump ofgrease to which more or less of the sand or mud or broken shells asthe case might be adhered and was brought to the surface</s>  but howeverwell adapted such an apparatus might be for rough nautical purposesscientific accuracy could not be expected from the armed lead and toremedy its defects especially when applied to sounding in great depthslieut</s>  brooke of the american navy some years ago invented a mostingenious machine by which a considerable portion of the superficiallayer of the seabottom can be scooped out and brought up from anydepth to which the lead descends</s> in 1853 lieut</s>  brooke obtained mud from the bottom of the northatlantic between newfoundland and the azores at a depth of more than10000 feet or two miles by the help of this sounding apparatus</s>  thespecimens were sent for examination to ehrenberg of berlin and tobailey of west point and those able microscopists found that thisdeepsea mud was almost entirely composed of the skeletons of livingorganismsthe greater proportion of these being just like theglobigerin already known to occur in the chalk</s> thus far the work had been carried on simply in the interests ofscience but lieut</s>  brookes method of sounding acquired a highcommercial value when the enterprise of laying down the telegraphcablebetween this country and the united states was undertaken</s>  for it becamea matter of immense importance to know not only the depth of the seaover the whole line along which the cable was to be laid but the exactnature of the bottom so as to guard against chances of cutting orfraying the strands of that costly rope</s>  the admiralty consequentlyordered captain dayman an old friend and shipmate of mine to ascertainthe depth over the whole line of the cable and to bring back specimensof the bottom</s>  in former days such a command as this might have soundedvery much like one of the impossible things which the young prince inthe fairy tales is ordered to do before he can obtain the hand of theprincess</s>  however in the months of june and july 1857 my friendperformed the task assigned to him with great expedition and precisionwithout so far as i know having met with any reward of that kind</s>  thespecimens of atlantic mud which he procured were sent to me to beexamined and reported upon</s> 29the result of all these operations is that we know the contours and thenature of the surfacesoil covered by the north atlantic for a distanceof 1700 miles from east to west as well as we know that of any part ofthe dry land</s> it is a prodigious plainone of the widest and most even plains in theworld</s>  if the sea were drained off you might drive a wagon all the wayfrom valentia on the west coast of ireland to trinity bay innewfoundland</s>  and except upon one sharp incline about 200 miles fromvalentia i am not quite sure that it would even be necessary to put theskid on so gentle are the ascents and descents upon that long route</s> from valentia the road would lie down hill for about 200 miles to thepoint at which the bottom is now covered by 1700 fathoms of seawater</s> then would come the central plain more than a thousand miles wide theinequalities of the surface of which would be hardly perceptible thoughthe depth of water upon it now varies from 10000 to 15000 feet andthere are places in which mont blanc might be sunk without showing itspeak above water</s>  beyond this the ascent on the american sidecommences and gradually leads for about 300 miles to the newfoundlandshore</s> almost the whole of the bottom of this central plain which extends formany hundred miles in a north and south direction is covered by a finemud which when brought to the surface dries into a greyishwhitefriable substance</s>  you can write with this on a blackboard if you areso inclined and to the eye it is quite like very soft greyish chalk</s> examined chemically it proves to be composed almost wholly of carbonateof lime and if you make a section of it in the same way as that of thepiece of chalk was made and view it with the microscope it presentsinnumerable globigerin embedded in a granular matrix</s> thus this deepsea mud is substantially chalk</s>  i say substantiallybecause there are a good many minor differences but as these have nobearing on the question immediately before uswhich is the nature ofthe globigerin of the chalkit is unnecessary to speak of them</s> globigerin of every size from the smallest to the largest areassociated together in the atlantic mud and the chambers of many arefilled by a soft animal matter</s>  this soft substance is in fact theremains of the creature to which the globigerina shell or ratherskeleton owes its existenceand which is an animal of the simplestimaginable description</s>  it is in fact a mere particle of living jellywithout defined parts of any kindwithout a mouth nerves muscles ordistinct organs and only manifesting its vitality to ordinaryobservation by thrusting out and retracting from all parts of itssurface long filamentous processes which serve for arms and legs</s>  yetthis amorphous particle devoid of everything which in the higheranimals we call organs is capable of feeding growing andmultiplying of separating from the ocean the small proportion ofcarbonate of lime which is dissolved in seawater and of building upthat substance into a skeleton for itself according to a pattern whichcan be imitated by no other known agency</s> the notion that animals can live and flourish in the sea at the vastdepths from which apparently living globigerin have been brought updoes not agree very well with our usual conceptions respecting theconditions of animal life and it is not so absolutely impossible as itmight at first sight appear to be that the globigerin of theatlantic seabottom do not live and die where they are found</s> as i have mentioned the soundings from the great atlantic plain arealmost entirely made up of globigerin with the granules which havebeen mentioned and some few other calcareous shells but a smallpercentage of the chalky mudperhaps at most some five per cent</s>  ofitis of a different nature and consists of shells and skeletonscomposed of silex or pure flint</s>  these silicious bodies belong partlyto the lowly vegetable organisms which are called diatomace andpartly to the minute and extremely simple animals termedradiolaria</s>  it is quite certain that these creatures do not live atthe bottom of the ocean but at its surfacewhere they may be obtainedin prodigious numbers by the use of a properly constructed net</s>  henceit follows that these silicious organisms though they are not heavierthan the lightest dust must have fallen in some cases through fifteenthousand feet of water before they reached their final restingplace onthe ocean floor</s>  and considering how large a surface these bodiesexpose in proportion to their weight it is probable that they occupy agreat length of time in making their burial journey from the surface ofthe atlantic to the bottom</s> but if the radiolaria and diatoms are thus rained upon the bottom ofthe sea from the superficial layer of its waters in which they passtheir lives it is obviously possible that the globigerin may besimilarly derived and if they were so it would be much more easy tounderstand how they obtain their supply of food than it is at present</s> nevertheless the positive and negative evidence all points the otherway</s>  the skeletons of the fullgrown deepsea globigerin are soremarkably solid and heavy in proportion to their surface as to seemlittle fitted for floating and as a matter of fact they are not to befound along with the diatoms and radiolaria in the uppermost stratumof the open ocean</s> it has been observed again that the abundance of globigerin inproportion to other organisms of like kind increases with the depth ofthe sea and that deepwater globigerin are larger than those whichlive in shallower parts of the sea and such facts negative thesupposition that these organisms have been swept by currents from theshallows into the deeps of the atlantic</s> it therefore seems to be hardly doubtful that these wonderful creatureslive and die at the depths in which they are found</s> 30however the important points for us are that the living globigerinare exclusively marine animals the skeletons of which abound at thebottom of deep seas and that there is not a shadow of reason forbelieving that the habits of the globigerin of the chalk differedfrom those of the existing species</s>  but if this be true there is noescaping the conclusion that the chalk itself is the dried mud of anancient deep sea</s> in working over the soundings collected by captain dayman i wassurprised to find that many of what i have called the granules of thatmud were not as one might have been tempted to think at first themere powder and waste of globigerin but that they had a definiteform and size i termed these bodies coccoliths and doubted theirorganic nature</s>  dr</s>  wallich verified my observation and added theinteresting discovery that not unfrequently bodies similar to thesecoccoliths were aggregated together into spheroids which he termedcoccospheres</s>  so far as we knew these bodies the nature of whichis extremely puzzling and problematical were peculiar to the atlanticsoundings</s> but a few years ago mr</s>  sorby in making a careful examination of thechalk by means of thin sections and otherwise observed as ehrenberghad done before him that much of its granular basis possesses adefinite form</s>  comparing these formed particles with those in theatlantic soundings he found the two to be identical and thus provedthat the chalk like the soundings contains these mysterious coccolithsand coccospheres</s>  here was a further and a most interestingconfirmation from internal evidence of the essential identity of thechalk with modern deepsea mud</s>  globigerin coccoliths andcoccospheres are found as the chief constituents of both and testify tothe general similarity of the conditions under which both have beenformed</s> 31the evidence furnished by the hewing facing and superposition of thestones of the pyramids that these structures were built by men has nogreater weight than the evidence that the chalk was built byglobigerin and the belief that those ancient pyramidbuilders wereterrestrial and airbreathing creatures like ourselves is not betterbased than the conviction that the chalkmakers lived in the sea</s> but as our belief in the building of the pyramids by men is not onlygrounded on the internal evidence afforded by these structures butgathers strength from multitudinous collateral proofs and is clinchedby the total absence of any reason for a contrary belief so theevidence drawn from the globigerin that the chalk is an ancientseabottom is fortified by innumerable independent lines of evidenceand our belief in the truth of the conclusion to which all positivetestimony tends receives the like negative justification from the factthat no other hypothesis has a shadow of foundation</s> it may be worth while briefly to consider a few of these collateralproofs that the chalk was deposited at the bottom of the sea</s> the great mass of the chalk is composed as we have seen of theskeletons of globigerin and other simple organisms imbedded ingranular matter</s>  here and there however this hardened mud of theancient sea reveals the remains of higher animals which have lived anddied and left their hard parts in the mud just as the oysters die andleave their shells behind them in the mud of the present seas</s> there are at the present day certain groups of animals which are neverfound in fresh waters being unable to live anywhere but in the sea</s> such are the corals those corallines which are called polyzoa thosecreatures which fabricate the lampshells and are called brachiopodathe pearly nautilus and all animals allied to it and all the formsof seaurchins and starfishes</s> not only are all these creatures confined to salt water at the presentday but so far as our records of the past go the conditions of theirexistence have been the same hence their occurrence in any deposit isas strong evidence as can be obtained that that deposit was formed inthe sea</s>  now the remains of animals of all the kinds which have beenenumerated occur in the chalk in greater or less abundance while notone of those forms of shellfish which are characteristic of fresh waterhas yet been observed in it</s> when we consider that the remains of more than three thousand distinctspecies of aquatic animals have been discovered among the fossils of thechalk that the great majority of them are of such forms as are now metwith only in the sea and that there is no reason to believe that anyone of them inhabited fresh waterthe collateral evidence that thechalk represents an ancient seabottom acquires as great force as theproof derived from the nature of the chalk itself</s>  i think you will nowallow that i did not overstate my case when i asserted that we have asstrong grounds for believing that all the vast area of dry land atpresent occupied by the chalk was once at the bottom of the sea as wehave for any matter of history whatever while there is no justificationfor any other belief</s> no less certain is it that the time during which the countries we nowcall southeast england france germany poland russia egypt arabiasyria were more or less completely covered by a deep sea was ofconsiderable duration</s> we have already seen that the chalk is in places more than a thousandfeet thick</s>  i think you will agree with me that it must have taken sometime for the skeletons of animalcules of a hundredth of an inch indiameter to heap up such a mass as that</s>  i have said that throughout thethickness of the chalk the remains of other animals are scattered</s>  theseremains are often in the most exquisite state of preservation</s>  thevalves of the shellfishes are commonly adherent the long spines ofsome of the seaurchins which would be detached by the smallest jaroften remain in their places</s>  in a word it is certain that theseanimals have lived and died when the place which they now occupy wasthe surface of as much of the chalk as had then been deposited and thateach has been covered up by the layer of globigerin mud upon whichthe creatures imbedded a little higher up have in like manner livedand died</s>  but some of these remains prove the existence of reptiles ofvast size in the chalk sea</s>  these lived their time and had theirancestors and descendants which assuredly implies time reptiles beingof slow growth</s> there is more curious evidence again that the process of covering upor in other words the deposit of globigerin skeletons did not goon very fast</s>  it is demonstrable that an animal of the cretaceous seamight die that its skeleton might lie uncovered upon the seabottomlong enough to lose all its outward coverings and appendages byputrefaction and that after this had happened another animal mightattach itself to the dead and naked skeleton might grow to maturityand might itself die before the calcareous mud had buried the whole</s> cases of this kind are admirably described by sir charles lyell</s>  hespeaks of the frequency with which geologists find in the chalk afossilized seaurchin to which is attached the lower valve of acrania</s>  this is a kind of shellfish with a shell composed of twopieces of which as in the oyster one is fixed and the other free</s> the upper valve is almost invariably wanting though occasionally foundin a perfect state of preservation in the white chalk at some distance</s> in this case we see clearly that the seaurchin first lived from youthto age then died and lost its spines which were carried away</s>  thenthe young crania adhered to the bared shell grew and perished in itsturn after which the upper valve was separated from the lower beforethe echinus became enveloped in chalky mud</s> 32a specimen in the museum of practical geology in london still furtherprolongs the period which must have elapsed between the death of theseaurchin and its burial by the globigerin</s>  for the outward face ofthe valve of a crania which is attached to a seaurchinmicraster is itself overrun by an incrusting coralline whichspreads thence over more or less of the surface of the seaurchin</s>  itfollows that after the upper valve of the crania fell off thesurface of the attached valve must have remained exposed long enough toallow of the growth of the whole coralline since corallines do not liveimbedded in mud</s> the progress of knowledge may one day enable us to deduce from suchfacts as these the maximum rate at which the chalk can have accumulatedand thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk period</s>  supposethat the valve of the crania upon which a coralline has fixed itselfin the way just described is so attached to the seaurchin that no partof it is more than an inch above the face upon which the seaurchinrests</s>  then as the coralline could not have fixed itself if thecrania had been covered up with chalk mud and could not have livedhad itself been so covered it follows that an inch of chalk mud couldnot have accumulated within the time between the death and decay of thesoft parts of the seaurchin and the growth of the coralline to the fullsize which it has attained</s>  if the decay of the soft parts of theseaurchin the attachment growth to maturity and decay of thecrania and the subsequent attachment and growth of the corallinetook a year which is a low estimate enough the accumulation of theinch of chalk must have taken more than a year and the deposit of athousand feet of chalk must consequently have taken more than twelvethousand years</s> the foundation of all this calculation is of course a knowledge of thelength of time the crania and the coralline needed to attain theirfull size and on this head precise knowledge is at present wanting</s> but there are circumstances which tend to show that nothing like aninch of chalk has accumulated during the life of a crania and on anyprobable estimate of the length of that life the chalk period must havehad a much longer duration than that thus roughly assigned to it</s> thus not only is it certain that the chalk is the mud of an ancientseabottom but it is no less certain that the chalk sea existed duringan extremely long period though we may not be prepared to give aprecise estimate of the length of that period in years</s>  the relativeduration is clear though the absolute duration may not be definable</s> the attempt to affix any precise date to the period at which the chalksea began or ended its existence is baffled by difficulties of thesame kind</s>  but the relative age of the cretaceous epoch may bedetermined with as great ease and certainty as the long duration of thatepoch</s> you will have heard of the interesting discoveries recently made invarious parts of western europe of flint implements obviously workedinto shape by human hands under circumstances which show conclusivelythat man is a very ancient denizen of these regions</s> it has been proved that the old populations of europe whose existencehas been revealed to us in this way consisted of savages such as theesquimaux are now that in the country which is now france they huntedthe reindeer and were familiar with the ways of the mammoth and thebison</s>  the physical geography of france was in those days different fromwhat it is nowthe river somme for instance having cut its bed ahundred feet deeper between that time and this and it is probablethat the climate was more like that of canada or siberia than that ofwestern europe</s> the existence of these people is forgotten even in the traditions of theoldest historical nations</s>  the name and fame of them had utterlyvanished until a few years back and the amount of physical change whichhas been effected since their day renders it more than probable thatvenerable as are some of the historical nations the workers of thechipped flints of hoxne or of amiens are to them as they are to us inpoint of antiquity</s> but if we assign to these hoar relics of long vanished generations ofmen the greatest age that can possibly be claimed for them they are notolder than the drift or boulder clay which in comparison with thechalk is but a very juvenile deposit</s>  you need go no further than yourown seaboard for evidence of this fact</s>  at one of the most charmingspots on the coast of norfolk cromer you will see the boulder clayforming a vast mass which lies upon the chalk and must consequentlyhave come into existence after it</s>  huge boulders of chalk are in factincluded in the clay and have evidently been brought to the positionthey now occupy by the same agency as that which has planted blocks ofsyenite from norway side by side with them</s> the chalk then is certainly older than the boulder clay</s>  if you askhow much i will again take you no further than the same spot upon yourown coasts for evidence</s>  i have spoken of the boulder clay and drift asresting upon the chalk</s>  that is not strictly true</s>  interposed betweenthe chalk and the drift is a comparatively insignificant layercontaining vegetable matter</s>  but that layer tells a wonderful history</s> it is full of stumps of trees standing as they grew</s>  firtrees are therewith their cones and hazelbushes with their nuts there stand thestools of oak and yew trees beeches and alders</s>  hence this stratum isappropriately called the forestbed</s> it is obvious that the chalk must have been upheaved and converted intodry land before the timber trees could grow upon it</s>  as the bolls ofsome of these trees are from two to three feet in diameter it is noless clear that the dry land thus formed remained in the same conditionfor long ages</s>  and not only do the remains of stately oaks andwellgrown firs testify to the duration of this condition of things butadditional evidence to the same effect is afforded by the abundantremains of elephants rhinoceroses hippopotamuses and other great wildbeasts which it has yielded to the zealous search of such men as therev</s>  mr</s>  gunn</s> when you look at such a collection as he has formed and bethink youthat these elephantine bones did veritably carry their owners aboutand these great grinders crunch in the dark woods of which theforestbed is now the only trace it is impossible not to feel that theyare as good evidence of the lapse of time as the annual rings of thetreestumps</s> thus there is a writing upon the wall of cliffs at cromer and whosoruns may read it</s>  it tells us with an authority which cannot beimpeached that the ancient seabed of the chalk sea was raised up andremained dry land until it was covered with forest stocked with thegreat game whose spoils have rejoiced your geologists</s>  how long itremained in that condition cannot be said but the whirligig of timebrought its revenges in those days as in these</s>  that dry land with thebones and teeth of generations of longlived elephants hidden awayamong the gnarled roots and dry leaves of its ancient trees sankgradually to the bottom of the icy sea which covered it with hugemasses of drift and boulder clay</s>  seabeasts such as the walrus nowrestricted to the extreme north paddled about where birds had twitteredamong the topmost twigs of the firtrees</s>  how long this state of thingsendured we know not but at length it came to an end</s>  the upheavedglacial mud hardened into the soil of modern norfolk</s>  forests grew oncemore the wolf and the beaver replaced the reindeer and the elephantand at length what we call the history of england dawned</s> thus you have within the limits of your own county proof that thechalk can justly claim a very much greater antiquity than even theoldest physical traces of mankind</s>  but we may go further anddemonstrate by evidence of the same authority as that which testifiesto the existence of the father of men that the chalk is vastly olderthan adam himself</s> the book of genesis informs us that adam immediately upon his creationand before the appearance of eve was placed in the garden of eden</s>  theproblem of the geographical position of eden has greatly vexed thespirits of the learned in such matters but there is one pointrespecting which so far as i know no commentator has ever raised adoubt</s>  this is that of the four rivers which are said to run out of iteuphrates and hiddekel are identical with the rivers now known by thenames of euphrates and tigris</s> but the whole country in which these mighty rivers take their originand through which they run is composed of rocks which are either of thesame age as the chalk or of later date</s>  so that the chalk must not onlyhave been formed but after its formation the time required for thedeposit of these later rocks and for their upheaval into dry land musthave elapsed before the smallest brook which feeds the swift stream ofthe great river the river of babylon began to flow</s> thus evidence which cannot be rebutted and which need not bestrengthened though if time permitted i might indefinitely increase itsquantity compels you to believe that the earth from the time of thechalk to the present day has been the theatre of a series of changes asvast in their amount as they were slow in their progress</s>  the area onwhich we stand has been first sea and then land for at least fouralternations and has remained in each of these conditions for a periodof great length</s> nor have these wonderful metamorphoses of sea into land and of landinto sea been confined to one corner of england</s>  during the chalkperiod or cretaceous epoch not one of the present great physicalfeatures of the globe was in existence</s>  our great mountain rangespyrenees alps himalayas andes have all been upheaved since the chalkwas deposited and the cretaceous sea flowed over the sites of sinai andararat</s> all this is certain because rocks of cretaceous or still later datehave shared in the elevatory movements which gave rise to these mountainchains and may be found perched up in some cases many thousand feethigh upon their flanks</s>  and evidence of equal cogency demonstrates thatthough in norfolk the forestbed rests directly upon the chalk yet itdoes so not because the period at which the forest grew immediatelyfollowed that at which the chalk was formed but because an immenselapse of time represented elsewhere by thousands of feet of rock isnot indicated at cromer</s> i must ask you to believe that there is no less conclusive proof that astill more prolonged succession of similar changes occurred before thechalk was deposited</s>  nor have we any reason to think that the first termin the series of these changes is known</s>  the oldest seabeds preservedto us are sands and mud and pebbles the wear and tear of rocks whichwere formed in still older oceans</s> but great as is the magnitude of these physical changes of the worldthey have been accompanied by a no less striking series of modificationsin its living inhabitants</s> all the great classes of animals beasts of the field fowls of theair creeping things and things which dwell in the waters flourishedupon the globe long ages before the chalk was deposited</s>  very fewhowever if any of these ancient forms of animal life were identicalwith those which now live</s>  certainly not one of the higher animals wasof the same species as any of those now in existence</s>  the beasts of thefield in the days before the chalk were not our beasts of the fieldnor the fowls of the air such as those which the eye of men has seenflying unless his antiquity dates infinitely further back than we atpresent surmise</s>  if we could be carried back into those times we shouldbe as one suddenly set down in australia before it was colonized</s>  weshould see mammals birds reptiles fishes insects snails and thelike clearly recognisable as such and yet not one of them would bejust the same as those with which we are familiar and many would beextremely different</s> from that time to the present the population of the world has undergoneslow and gradual but incessant changes</s>  there has been no grandcatastropheno destroyer has swept away the forms of life of oneperiod and replaced them by a totally new creation but one species hasvanished and another has taken its place creatures of one type ofstructure have diminished those of another have increased as time haspassed on</s>  and thus while the differences between the living creaturesof the time before the chalk and those of the present day appearstartling if placed side by side we are led from one to the other bythe most gradual progress if we follow the course of nature throughthe whole series of those relics of her operations which she has leftbehind</s> and it is by the population of the chalk sea that the ancient and themodern inhabitants of the world are most completely connected</s>  thegroups which are dying out flourish side by side with the groups whichare now the dominant forms of life</s> thus the chalk contains remains of those strange flying and swimmingreptiles the pterodactyl the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosauruswhich are found in no later deposits but abounded in preceding ages</s> the chambered shells called ammonites and belemnites which are socharacteristic of the period preceding the cretaceous in like mannerdie with it</s> but amongst these fading remainders of a previous state of things aresome very modern forms of life looking like yankee pedlars among atribe of red indians</s>  crocodiles of modern type appear bony fishesmany of them very similar to existing species almost supplant the formsof fish which predominate in more ancient seas and many kinds of livingshellfish first become known to us in the chalk</s>  the vegetationacquires a modern aspect</s>  a few living animals are not evendistinguishable as species from those which existed at that remoteepoch</s>  the globigerina of the present day for example is notdifferent specifically from that of the chalk and the same may be saidof many other foraminifera</s>  i think it probable that critical andunprejudiced examination will show that more than one species of muchhigher animals have had a similar longevity but the only example whichi can at present give confidently is the snakeshead lampshellterebratulina caput serpentis which lives in our english seas andabounded as terebratulina striata of authors in the chalk</s> the longest line of human ancestry must hide its diminished head beforethe pedigree of this insignificant shellfish</s>  we englishmen are proudto have an ancestor who was present at the battle of hastings</s>  theancestors of terebratulina caput serpentis may have been present at abattle of ichthyosauria in that part of the sea which when the chalkwas forming flowed over the site of hastings</s>  while all around haschanged this terebratulina has peacefully propagated its species fromgeneration to generation and stands to this day as a living testimonyto the continuity of the present with the past history of the globe</s> up to this moment i have stated so far as i know nothing butwellauthenticated facts and the immediate conclusions which they forceupon the mind</s> but the mind is so constituted that it does not willingly rest in factsand immediate causes but seeks always after a knowledge of the remoterlinks in the chain of causation</s> taking the many changes of any given spot of the earths surface fromsea to land and from land to sea as an established fact we cannotrefrain from asking ourselves how these changes have occurred</s>  and whenwe have explained themas they must be explainedby the alternate slowmovements of elevation and depression which have affected the crust ofthe earth we go still further back and ask why these movements</s> i am not certain that any one can give you a satisfactory answer tothat question</s>  assuredly i cannot</s>  all that can be said for certainis that such movements are part of the ordinary course of natureinasmuch as they are going on at the present time</s>  direct proof may begiven that some parts of the land of the northern hemisphere are atthis moment insensibly rising and others insensibly sinking and thereis indirect but perfectly satisfactory proof that an enormous areanow covered by the pacific has been deepened thousands of feet sincethe present inhabitants of that sea came into existence</s> thus there is not a shadow of a reason for believing that the physicalchanges of the globe in past times have been effected by other thannatural causes</s> is there any more reason for believing that the concomitantmodifications in the forms of the living inhabitants of the globe havebeen brought about in other ways</s> before attempting to answer this question let us try to form a distinctmental picture of what has happened in some special case</s> the crocodiles are animals which as a group have a very vastantiquity</s>  they abounded ages before the chalk was deposited theythrong the rivers in warm climates at the present day</s>  there is adifference in the form of the joints of the backbone and in some minorparticulars between the crocodiles of the present epoch and those whichlived before the chalk but in the cretaceous epoch as i have alreadymentioned the crocodiles had assumed the modern type of structure</s> notwithstanding this the crocodiles of the chalk are not identicallythe same as those which lived in the times called older tertiarywhich succeeded the cretaceous epoch and the crocodiles of the oldertertiaries are not identical with those of the newer tertiaries nor arethese identical with existing forms</s>  i leave open the question whetherparticular species may have lived on from epoch to epoch</s>  but each epochhas had its peculiar crocodiles though all since the chalk havebelonged to the modern type and differ simply in their proportions andin such structural particulars as are discernible only to trained eyes</s> how is the existence of this long succession of different species ofcrocodiles to be accounted for</s> only two suppositions seem to be open to useither each species ofcrocodile has been specially created or it has arisen out of somepreexisting form by the operation of natural causes</s> choose your hypothesis i have chosen mine</s>  i can find no warranty forbelieving in the distinct creation of a score of successive species ofcrocodiles in the course of countless ages of time</s>  science gives nocountenance to such a wild fancy nor can even the perverse ingenuity ofa commentator pretend to discover this sense in the simple words inwhich the writer of genesis records the proceedings of the fifth andsixth days of the creation</s> on the other hand i see no good reason for doubting the necessaryalternative that all these varied species have been evolved frompreexisting crocodilian forms by the operation of causes as completelya part of the common order of nature as those which have effected thechanges of the inorganic world</s> few will venture to affirm that the reasoning which applies tocrocodiles loses its force among other animals or among plants</s>  if oneseries of species has come into existence by the operation of naturalcauses it seems folly to deny that all may have arisen in the same way</s> a small beginning has led us to a great ending</s>  if i were to put the bitof chalk with which we started into the hot but obscure flame of burninghydrogen it would presently shine like the sun</s>  it seems to me thatthis physical

definite and unquestionable of all theresults of palontology must be mentioned the immense extension andimpulse given to botany zoology and comparative anatomy by theinvestigation of fossil

that hercharity is of the sort that does not impoverish but blesseth him thatgives and him that takes</s> regard the matter as we will however the facts remain</s>  nearly 40000species of animals and

take into account the small population of insects asyet found fossil and the large proportion and peculiar organization ofmany of the vertebrata</s> but beyond this it is perhaps not too much to say that except for thenecessity of interpreting palontological facts the laws ofdistribution would have received less careful study while fewcomparative anatomists and those not of the first order would havebeen induced by mere love of detail as such to study the minuti ofosteology were it not that in such minuti lie the only keys to themost interesting riddles offered by the extinct animal world</s> these assuredly are great and solid gains</s>  surely it is matter for nosmall congratulation that in half a century for palontology though itdawned earlier came into full day only with cuvier a subordinatebranch of biology should have doubled the value and the interest of thewhole group of sciences to which it belongs</s> but this is not all</s>  allied with geology palontology has establishedtwo laws of inestimable importance the first that one and the samearea of the earths surface has been successively occupied by verydifferent kinds of living beings the second that the order ofsuccession established in one locality holds good approximately inall</s> the first of these laws is universal and irreversible the second is aninduction from a vast number of observations though it may possiblyand even probably have to admit of exceptions</s>  as a consequence of thesecond law it follows that a peculiar relation frequently subsistsbetween series of strata containing organic remains in differentlocalities</s>  the series resemble one another not only in virtue of ageneral resemblance of the organic remains in the two but also invirtue of a resemblance in the order and character of the serialsuccession in each</s>  there is a resemblance of arrangement so that theseparate terms of each series as well as the whole series exhibit acorrespondence</s> succession implies time the lower members of a series of sedimentaryrocks are certainly older than the upper and when the notion of age wasonce introduced as the equivalent of succession it was no wonder thatcorrespondence in succession came to be looked upon as correspondence inage or contemporaneity</s>  and indeed so long as relative age only isspoken of correspondence in succession is correspondence in age itis relative contemporaneity</s> but it would have been very much better for geology if so loose andambiguous a word as contemporaneous had been excluded from herterminology and if in its stead some term expressing similarity ofserial relation and excluding the notion of time altogether had beenemployed to denote correspondence in position in two or more series ofstrata</s> in anatomy where such correspondence of position has constantly to bespoken of it is denoted by the word homology and its derivatives andfor geology which after all is only the anatomy and physiology of theearth it might be well to invent some single word such as homotaxissimilarity of order in order to express an essentially similar idea</s> this however has not been done and most probably the inquiry will atonce be madeto what end burden science with a new and strange term inplace of one old familiar and part of our common language</s> the reply to this question will become obvious as the inquiry into theresults of palontology is pushed further</s> those whose business it is to acquaint themselves specially with theworks of palontologists in fact will be fully aware that very few ifany would rest satisfied with such a statement of the conclusions oftheir branch of biology as that which has just been given</s> our standard repertories of palontology profess to teach us far higherthingsto disclose the entire succession of living forms upon thesurface of the globe to tell us of a wholly different distribution ofclimatic conditions in ancient times to reveal the character of thefirst of all living existences and to trace out the law of progressfrom them to us</s> it may not be unprofitable to bestow on these professions a somewhatmore critical examination than they have hitherto received in order toascertain how far they rest on an irrefragable basis or whether afterall it might not be well for palontologists to learn a little morecarefully that scientific ars artium the art of saying i dontknow</s>  and to this end let us define somewhat more exactly the extent ofthese pretensions of palontology</s> every one is aware that professor bronns untersuchungen

distinguished authorswith the utmost respect and in a tone as far as possible removed fromcarping criticism indeed if they are specially cited in this place itis merely in justification of the assertion that the followingpropositions which may be found implicitly or explicitly in the worksin question are regarded by the mass of palontologists and geologistsnot only on the continent but in this country as expressing some of thebestestablished results of palontology</s>  thusanimals and plants began their existence together not long after thecommencement of the deposition of the sedimentary rocks and thensucceeded one another in such a manner that totally distinct faunasand flor occupied the whole surface of the earth one after the otherand during distinct epochs of time</s> a geological formation is the sum of all the strata deposited over thewhole surface of the earth during one of these epochs a geologicalfauna or flora is the sum of all the species of animals or plants whichoccupied the whole surface of the globe during one of these epochs</s> the population of the earths surface was at first very similar in allparts and only from the middle of the tertiary epoch onwards began toshow a distinct distribution in zones</s> the constitution of the original population as well as the numericalproportions of its members indicates a warmer and on the wholesomewhat tropical climate which remained tolerably equable throughoutthe year</s>  the subsequent distribution of living beings in zones is theresult of a gradual lowering of the general temperature which firstbegan to be felt at the poles</s> it is not now proposed to inquire whether these doctrines are true orfalse but to direct your attention to a much simpler though veryessential preliminary questionwhat is their logical basis</s>  what arethe fundamental assumptions upon which they all logically depend</s>  andwhat is the evidence on which those fundamental propositions demand ourassent</s> these assumptions are two the first that the commencement of thegeological record is coeval with the commencement of life on the globethe second that geological contemporaneity is the same thing aschronological synchrony</s>  without the first of these assumptions therewould of course be no ground for any statement respecting thecommencement of life without the second all the other statementscited every one of which implies a knowledge of the state of differentparts of the earth at one and the same time will be no less devoid ofdemonstration</s> the first assumption obviously rests entirely on negative evidence</s>  thisis of course the only evidence that ever can be available to prove thecommencement of any series of phnomena but at the same time it mustbe recollected that the value of negative evidence depends entirely onthe amount of positive corroboration it receives</s>  if a</s> b</s>  wishes toprove an alibi it is of no use for him to get a thousand witnessessimply to swear that they did not see him in such and such a placeunless the witnesses are prepared to prove that they must have seen himhad he been there</s>  but the evidence that animal life commenced with thelingulaflags e</s> g</s>  would seem to be exactly of this unsatisfactoryuncorroborated sort</s>  the cambrian witnesses simply swear they haventseen anybody their way upon which the counsel for the other sideimmediately puts in ten or twelve thousand feet of devonian sandstonesto make oath they never saw a fish or a mollusk though all the worldknows there were plenty in their time</s> but then it is urged that though the devonian rocks in one part of theworld exhibit no fossils in another they do while the lower cambrianrocks nowhere exhibit fossils and hence no living being could haveexisted in their epoch</s> to this there are two replies the first that the observational basisof the assertion that the lowest rocks are nowhere fossiliferous is anamazingly small one seeing how very small an area in comparison tothat of the whole world has yet been fully searched the second thatthe argument is good for nothing unless the unfossiliferous rocks inquestion were not only contemporaneous in the geological sense butsynchronous in the chronological sense</s>  to use the alibiillustration again</s>  if a man wishes to prove he was in neither of twoplaces a and b on a given day his witnesses for each place must beprepared to answer for the whole day</s>  if they can only prove that he wasnot at a in the morning and not at b in the afternoon the evidence ofhis absence from both is nil because he might have been at b in themorning and at a in the afternoon</s> thus everything depends upon the validity of the second assumption</s>  andwe must proceed to inquire what is the real meaning of the wordcontemporaneous as employed by geologists</s>  to this end a concreteexample may be taken</s> the lias of england and the lias of germany the cretaceous rocks ofbritain and the cretaceous rocks of southern india are termed bygeologists contemporaneous formations but whenever any thoughtfulgeologist is asked whether he means to say that they were depositedsynchronously he says noonly within the same great epoch</s>  and ifin pursuing the inquiry he is asked what may be the approximate valuein time of a great epochwhether it means a hundred years or athousand or a million or ten million yearshis reply is i cannottell</s> if the further question be put whether physical geology is inpossession of any method by which the actual synchrony or the reverseof any two distant deposits can be ascertained no such method can beheard of it being admitted by all the best authorities that neithersimilarity of mineral composition nor of physical character nor evendirect continuity of stratum are absolute proofs of the synchronismof even approximated sedimentary strata while for distant depositsthere seems to be no kind of physical evidence attainable of a naturecompetent to decide whether such deposits were formed simultaneously orwhether they possess any given difference of antiquity</s>  to return to anexample already given</s>  all competent authorities will probably assent tothe proposition that physical geology does not enable us in any way toreply to this questionwere the british cretaceous rocks deposited atthe same time as those of india or are they a million of years youngeror a million of years older</s> is palontology able to succeed where physical geology fails</s>  standardwriters on palontology as has been seen assume that she can</s>  theytake it for granted that deposits containing similar organic remainsare synchronousat any rate in a broad sense and yet those who willstudy the eleventh and twelfth chapters of sir henry de la bechesremarkable researches in theoretical geology published now nearlythirty years ago and will carry out the arguments there most luminouslystated to their logical consequences may very easily convincethemselves that even absolute identity of organic contents is no proofof the synchrony of deposits while absolute diversity is no proof ofdifference of date</s>  sir henry de la beche goes even further and adducesconclusive evidence to show that the different parts of one and the samestratum having a similar composition throughout containing the sameorganic remains and having similar beds above and below it may yetdiffer to any conceivable extent in age</s> edward forbes was in the habit of asserting that the similarity of theorganic contents of distant formations was prim facie evidence notof their similarity but of their difference of age and holding as hedid the doctrine of single specific centres the conclusion was aslegitimate as any other for the two districts must have been occupiedby migration from one of the two or from an intermediate spot and thechances against exact coincidence of migration and of imbedding areinfinite</s> in point of fact however whether the hypothesis of single or ofmultiple specific centres be adopted similarity of organic contentscannot possibly afford any proof of the synchrony of the deposits whichcontain them on the contrary it is demonstrably compatible with thelapse of the most prodigious intervals of time and with interpositionof vast changes in the organic and inorganic worlds between the epochsin which such deposits were formed</s> on what amount of similarity of their faun is the doctrine of thecontemporaneity of the european and of the north american siluriansbased</s>  in the last edition of sir charles lyells elementary geologyit is stated on the authority of a former president of this societythe late daniel sharpe that between 30 and 40 per cent</s>  of the speciesof silurian mollusca are common to both sides of the atlantic</s>  by way ofdue allowance for further discovery let us double the lesser number andsuppose that 60 per cent</s>  of the species are common to the northamerican and the british silurians</s>  sixty per cent</s>  of species in commonis then proof of contemporaneity</s> now suppose that a million or two of years hence when britain has madeanother dip beneath the sea and has come up again some geologistapplies this doctrine in comparing the strata laid bare by the upheavalof the bottom say of st</s>  georges channel with what may then remain ofthe suffolk crag</s>  reasoning in the same way he will at once decide thesuffolk crag and the st</s>  georges channel beds to be contemporaneousalthough we happen to know that a vast period even in the geologicalsense of time and physical changes of almost unprecedented extentseparate the two</s> but if it be a demonstrable fact that strata containing more than 60 or70 per cent</s>  of species of mollusca in common and comparatively closetogether may yet be separated by an amount of geological timesufficient to allow of some of the greatest physical changes the worldhas seen what becomes of that sort of contemporaneity the sole evidenceof which is a similarity of facies or the identity of half a dozenspecies or of a good many genera</s> and yet there is no better evidence for the contemporaneity assumed byall who adopt the hypotheses of universal faun and flor of auniversally uniform climate and of a sensible cooling of the globeduring geological time</s> there seems then no escape from the admission that neither physicalgeology nor palontology possesses any method by which the absolutesynchronism of two strata can be demonstrated</s>  all that geology canprove is local order of succession</s>  it is mathematically certain thatin any given vertical linear section of an undisturbed series ofsedimentary deposits the bed which lies lowest is the oldest</s>  in anyother vertical linear section of the same series of coursecorresponding beds will occur in a similar order but however great maybe the probability no man can say with absolute certainty that the bedsin the two sections were synchronously deposited</s>  for areas of moderateextent it is doubtless true that no practical evil is likely to resultfrom assuming the corresponding beds to be synchronous or strictlycontemporaneous and there are multitudes of accessory circumstanceswhich may fully justify the assumption of such synchrony</s>  but the momentthe geologist has to deal with large areas or with completely separateddeposits the mischief of confounding that homotaxis or similarity ofarrangement which can be demonstrated with synchrony or identityof date for which there is not a shadow of proof under the one commonterm of contemporaneity becomes incalculable and proves the constantsource of gratuitous speculations</s> for anything that geology or palontology are able to show to thecontrary a devonian fauna and flora in the british islands may havebeen contemporaneous with silurian life in north america and with acarboniferous fauna and flora in africa</s>  geographical provinces andzones may have been as distinctly marked in the palozoic epoch as atpresent and those seemingly sudden appearances of new genera andspecies which we ascribe to new creation may be simple results ofmigration</s> it may be so it may be otherwise</s>  in the present condition of ourknowledge and of our methods one verdictnot proven and notproveablemust be recorded against all the grand hypotheses of thepalontologist respecting the general succession of life on the globe</s> the order and nature of terrestrial life as a whole are openquestions</s>  geology at present provides us with most valuabletopographical records but she has not the means of working them up intoa universal history</s>  is such a universal history then to be regardedas unattainable</s>  are

knowledge which he cannot obtain</s>  the reverse is to be hoped nayit may not be impossible to indicate the source whence help will come</s> in commencing these remarks mention was made of the great obligationsunder which the naturalist lies to the geologist and palontologist</s> assuredly the time will come when these obligations will be repaidtenfold and when the maze of the worlds past history through whichthe pure geologist and the pure palontologist find no guidance will besecurely threaded by the clue furnished by the naturalist</s> all who are competent to express an opinion on the subject are atpresent agreed that the manifold varieties of animal and vegetable formhave not either come into existence by chance nor result fromcapricious exertions of creative power but that they have taken placein a definite order the statement of which order is what men of scienceterm a natural law</s>  whether such a law is to be regarded as anexpression of the mode of operation of natural forces or whether it issimply a statement of the manner in which a supernatural power hasthought fit to act is a secondary question so long as the existence ofthe law and the possibility of its discovery by the human intellect aregranted</s>  but he must be a halfhearted philosopher who believing inthat possibility and having watched the gigantic strides of thebiological sciences during the last twenty years doubts that sciencewill sooner or later make this further step so as to become possessedof the law of evolution of organic formsof the unvarying order of thatgreat chain of causes and effects of which all organic forms ancientand modern are the links</s>  and then if ever we shall be able to beginto discuss with profit the questions respecting the commencement oflife and the nature of the successive populations of the globe whichso many seem to think are already answered</s> the preceding arguments make no particular claim to novelty indeed theyhave been floating more or less distinctly before the minds ofgeologists for the last thirty years and if at the present time ithas seemed desirable to give them more definite and systematicexpression it is because palontology is every day assuming a greaterimportance and now requires to rest on a basis the firmness of which isthoroughly well assured</s>  among its fundamental conceptions there mustbe no confusion between what is certain and what is more or lessprobable</s> 33 but pending the construction of a surer foundation thanpalontology now possesses it may be instructive assuming for thenonce the general correctness of the ordinary hypothesis of geologicalcontemporaneity to consider whether the deductions which are ordinarilydrawn from the whole body of palontological facts are justifiable</s> the evidence on which such conclusions are based is of two kindsnegative and positive</s>  the value of negative evidence in connexion withthis inquiry has been so fully and clearly discussed in an address fromthe chair of this society34 which none of us have forgotten thatnothing need at present be said about it the more as theconsiderations which have been laid before you have certainly not tendedto increase your estimation of such evidence</s>  it will be preferable toturn to the positive facts of palontology and to inquire what theytell us</s> we are all accustomed to speak of the number and the extent of thechanges in the living population of the globe during geological time assomething enormous and indeed they are so if we regard only thenegative differences which separate the older rocks from the moremodern and if we look upon specific and generic changes as greatchanges which from one point of view they truly are</s>  but leaving thenegative differences out of consideration and looking only at thepositive data furnished by the fossil world from a broader point ofviewfrom that of the comparative anatomist who has made the study ofthe greater modifications of animal form his chief businessa surpriseof another kind dawns upon the mind and under this aspect thesmallness of the total change becomes as astonishing as was itsgreatness under the other</s> there are two hundred known orders of plants of these not one iscertainly known to exist exclusively in the fossil state</s>  the wholelapse of geological time has as yet yielded not a single new ordinaltype of vegetable structure</s> 35the positive change in passing from the recent to the ancient animalworld is greater but still singularly small</s>  no fossil animal is sodistinct from those now living as to require to be arranged even in aseparate class from those which contain existing forms</s>  it is onlywhen we come to the orders which may be roughly estimated at about ahundred and thirty that we meet with fossil animals so distinct fromthose now living as to require orders for themselves and these do notamount on the most liberal estimate to more than about 10 per cent ofthe whole</s> there is no certainly known extinct order of protozoa there is but oneamong the coelenteratathat of the rugose corals there is none amongthe mollusca there are three the cystidea blastoidea andedrioasterida among the echinoderms and two the trilobita andeurypterida among the crustacea making altogether five for the greatsubkingdom of annulosa</s>  among vertebrates there is no ordinallydistinct fossil fish there is only one extinct order of amphibiathelabyrinthodonts but there are at least four distinct orders ofreptilia viz</s>  the ichthyosauria plesiosauria pterosauria dinosauriaand perhaps another or two</s>  there is no known extinct order of birdsand no certainly known extinct order of mammals the ordinaldistinctness of the toxodontia being doubtful</s> the objection that broad statements of this kind after all restlargely on negative evidence is obvious but it has less force than mayat first be supposed for as might be expected from the circumstancesof the case we possess more abundant positive evidence regarding fishesand marine mollusks than respecting any other forms of animal life andyet these offer us through the whole range of geological time nospecies ordinarily distinct from those now living while the far lessnumerous class of echinoderms presents three and the crustacea twosuch orders though none of these come down later than the palozoicage</s>  lastly the reptilia present the extraordinary and exceptionalphnomenon of as many extinct as existing orders if not more the fourmentioned maintaining their existence from the lias to the chalkinclusive</s> some years ago one of your secretaries pointed out another kind ofpositive palontological evidence tending towards the sameconclusionafforded by the existence of what he termed persistenttypes of vegetable and of animal life</s> 36 he stated on the authorityof dr</s>  hooker that there are carboniferous plants which appear to begenerically identical with some now living that the cone of the ooliticaraucaria is hardly distinguishable from that of an existing speciesthat a true pinus appears in the purbecks and a juglans in thechalk while from the bagshot sands a banksia the wood of which isnot distinguishable from that of species now living in australia hadbeen obtained</s> turning to the animal kingdom he affirmed the tabulate corals of thesilurian rocks to be wonderfully like those which now exist while eventhe families of the aporosa were all represented in the older mesozoicrocks</s> among the mollusca similar facts were adduced</s>  let it be borne in mindthat avicula mytilus chiton natica patella trochusdiscina orbicula lingula rhynchonella and nautilus all ofwhich are existing genera are given without a doubt as silurian inthe last edition of siluria while the highest forms of the highestcephalopods are represented in the lias by a genus belemnoteuthiswhich presents the closest relation to the existing loligo</s> the two highest groups of the annulosa the insecta and the arachnidaare represented in the coal either by existing genera or by formsdiffering from existing genera in quite minor peculiarities</s> turning to the vertebrata the only palozoic elasmobranch fish of whichwe have any complete knowledge is the devonian and carboniferouspleuracanthus which differs no more from existing sharks than thesedo from one another</s> again vast as is the number of undoubtedly ganoid fossil fishes andgreat as is their range in time a large mass of evidence has recentlybeen adduced to show that almost all those respecting which we possesssufficient information are referable to the same subordinal groups asthe existing lepidosteus polypterus and sturgeon and that asingular relation obtains between the older and the younger fishes theformer the devonian ganoids being almost all members of the samesuborder as polypterus while the mesozoic ganoids are almost allsimilarly allied to lepidosteus</s> 37again what can be more remarkable than the singular constancy ofstructure preserved throughout a vast period of time by the family ofthe pycnodonts and by that of the true coelacanths the formerpersisting with but insignificant modifications from the carboniferousto the tertiary rocks inclusive the latter existing with still lesschange from the carboniferous rocks to the chalk inclusive</s> among reptiles the highest living group that of the crocodilia isrepresented at the early part of the mesozoic epoch by speciesidentical in the essential characters of their organization with thosenow living and differing from the latter only in such matters as theform of the articular facets of the vertebral centra in the extent towhich the nasal passages are separated from the cavity of the mouth bybone and in the proportions of the limbs</s> and even as regards the mammalia the scanty remains of triassic andoolitic species afford no foundation for the supposition that theorganization of the oldest forms differed nearly so much from some ofthose which now live as these differ from one another</s> it is needless to multiply these instances enough has been said tojustify the statement that in view of the immense diversity of knownanimal and vegetable forms and the enormous lapse of time indicated bythe accumulation of fossiliferous strata the only circumstance to bewondered at is not that the changes of life as exhibited by positiveevidence have been so great but that they have been so small</s> be they great or small however it is desirable to attempt to estimatethem</s>  let us therefore take each great division of the animal world insuccession and whenever an order or a family can be shown to have hada prolonged existence let us endeavour to ascertain how far the latermembers of the group differ from the earlier ones</s>  if these latermembers in all or in many cases exhibit a certain amount ofmodification the fact is so far evidence in favour of a general law ofchange and in a rough way the rapidity of that change will bemeasured by the demonstrable amount of modification</s>  on the other handit must be recollected that the absence of any modification while itmay leave the doctrine of the existence of a law of change withoutpositive support cannot possibly disprove all forms of that doctrinethough it may afford a sufficient refutation of many of them</s> the protozoa</s> the protozoa are represented throughout thewhole range of geological series from the lower silurian formation tothe present day</s>  the most ancient forms recently made known by ehrenbergare exceedingly like those which now exist no one has ever pretendedthat the difference between any ancient and any modern foraminifera isof more than generic value nor are the oldest foraminifera eithersimpler more embryonic or less differentiated than the existingforms</s> the coelenterata</s> the tabulate corals have existed from thesilurian epoch to the present day but i am not aware that the ancientheliolites possesses a single mark of a more embryonic or lessdifferentiated character or less high organization than the existingheliopora</s>  as for the aporose corals in what respect is the silurianpaloeocydus less highly organized or more embryonic than the modernfungia or the liassic aporosa than the existing members of the samefamilies</s> the mollusca</s> in what sense is the living waldheimia lessembryonic or more specialized than the palozoic spirifer or theexisting rhynchonell crani discin lingul than thesilurian species of the same genera</s>  in what sense can loligo orspirula be said to be more specialized or less embryonic thanbelemnites or the modern species of lamellibranch and gasteropodgenera than the silurian species of the same genera</s> the annulosa</s> the carboniferous insecta and arachnida areneither less specialized nor more embryonic than those that now livenor are the liassic cirripedia and macrura while several of thebrachyura which appear in the chalk belong to existing genera andnone exhibit either an intermediate or an embryonic character</s> the vertebrata</s> among fishes i have referred to thecoelacanthini comprising the genera coelacanthus holophagusundina and macropoma as affording an example of a persistent typeand it is most remarkable to note the smallness of the differencesbetween any of these fishes affecting at most the proportions of thebody and fins and the character and sculpture of the scalesnotwithstanding their enormous range in time</s>  in all the essentials ofits very peculiar structure the macropoma of the chalk is identicalwith the coelacanthus of the coal</s>  look at the genus lepidotusagain persisting without a modification of importance from the liassicto the eocene formations inclusive</s> or among the teleosteiin what respect is the beryx of the chalk moreembryonic or less differentiated than beryx lineatus of kinggeorges sound</s> or to turn to the higher vertebratain what sense are the liassicchelonia inferior to those which now exist</s>  how are the cretaceousichthyosauria plesiosauria or pterosauria less embryonic or moredifferentiated species than those of the lias</s> or lastly in what circumstance is the phascolotherium more embryonicor of a more generalized type than the modern opossum or alophiodon or a palotherium than a modern tapirus or hyrax</s> these examples might be almost indefinitely multiplied but surely theyare sufficient to prove that the only safe and unquestionable testimonywe can procurepositive evidencefails to demonstrate any sort ofprogressive modification towards a less embryonic or less generalizedtype in a great many groups of animals of longcontinued geologicalexistence</s>  in these groups there is abundant evidence of variationnoneof what is ordinarily understood as progression and if the knowngeological record is to be regarded as even any considerable fragment ofthe whole it is inconceivable that any theory of a necessarilyprogressive development can stand for the numerous orders and familiescited afford no trace of such a process</s> but it is a most remarkable fact that while the groups which have beenmentioned and many besides exhibit no sign of progressivemodification there are others coexisting with them under the sameconditions in which more or less distinct indications of such a processseem to be traceable</s>  among such indications i may remind you of thepredominance of holostome gasteropoda in the older rocks as comparedwith that of siphonostome gasteropoda in the later</s>  a case less open tothe objection of negative evidence however is that afforded by thetetrabranchiate cephalopoda the forms of the shells and of the septalsutures exhibiting a certain increase of complexity in the newer genera</s> here however one is met at once with the occurrence of orthocerasand baculites at the two ends of the series and of the fact that oneof the simplest genera nautilus is that which now exists</s> the crinoidea in the abundance of stalked forms in the ancientformations as compared with their present rarity seem to present uswith a fair case of modification from a more embryonic towards a lessembryonic condition</s>  but then on careful consideration of the factsthe objection arises that the stalk calyx and arms of the palozoiccrinoid are exceedingly different from the corresponding organs of alarval comatula and it might with perfect justice be argued thatactinocrinus and eucalyptocrinus for example depart to the full aswidely in one direction from the stalked embryo of comatula ascomatula itself does in the other</s> the echinidea again are frequently quoted as exhibiting a gradualpassage from a more generalized to a more specialized type seeing thatthe elongated or oval spatangoids appear after the spheroidalechinoids</s>  but here it might be argued on the other hand that thespheroidal echinoids in reality depart further from the general planand from the embryonic form than the elongated spatangoids do and thatthe peculiar dental apparatus and the pedicellari of the former aremarks of at least as great differentiation as the petaloid ambulacra andsemit of the latter</s> once more the prevalence of macrurous before brachyurous podophthalmiais apparently a fair piece of evidence in favour of progressivemodification in the same order of crustacea and yet the case will notstand much sifting seeing that the macrurous podophthalmia depart asfar in one direction from the common type of podophthalmia or from anyembryonic condition of the brachyura as the brachyura do in the otherand that the middle terms between macrura and brachyuratheanomuraare little better represented in the older mesozoic rocks thanthe brachyura are</s> none of the cases of progressive modification which are cited from amongthe invertebrata appear to me to have a foundation less open tocriticism than these and if this be so no careful reasoner would ithink be inclined to lay very great stress upon them</s>  among thevertebrata however there are a few examples which appear to be farless open to objection</s> it is in fact true of several groups of vertebrata which have livedthrough a considerable range of time that the endoskeleton moreparticularly the spinal column of the older genera presents a lessossified and so far less differentiated condition than that of theyounger genera</s>  thus the devonian ganoids though almost all members ofthe same suborder as polypterus and presenting numerous importantresemblances to the existing genus which possesses biconcave vertebrare for the most part wholly devoid of ossified vertebral centra</s>  themesozoic lepidosteid again have at most biconcave vertebr whilethe existing lepidosteus has salamandroid opisthocoelous vertebr</s> so none of the palozoic sharks have shown themselves to be possessedof ossified vertebr while the majority of modern sharks possess suchvertebr</s>  again the more ancient crocodilia and lacertilia havevertebr with the articular facets of their centra flattened orbiconcave while the modern members of the same group have themprocoelous</s>  but the most remarkable examples of progressivemodification of the vertebral column in correspondence with geologicalage are those afforded by the pycnodonts among fish and thelabyrinthodonts among amphibia</s> the late able ichthyologist heckel pointed out the fact that while thepycnodonts never possess true vertebral centra they differ in thedegree of expansion and extension of the ends of the bony arches of thevertebr upon the sheath of the notochord the carboniferous formsexhibiting hardly any such expansion while the mesozoic genera presenta greater and greater development until in the tertiary forms theexpanded ends become suturally united so as to form a sort of falsevertebra</s>  hermann von meyer again to whose luminous researches we areindebted for our present large knowledge of the organization of theolder labyrinthodonts has proved that the carboniferous archegosaurushad very imperfectly developed vertebral centra while the triassicmastodonsaurus had the same parts completely ossified</s> 38the regularity and evenness of the dentition of the anoplotherium ascontrasted with that of existing artiodactyles and the assumed nearerapproach of the dentition of certain ancient carnivores to the typicalarrangement have also been cited as exemplifications of a law ofprogressive development but i know of no other cases based on positiveevidence which are worthy of particular notice</s> what then does an impartial survey of the positively ascertained truthsof palontology testify in relation to the common doctrines ofprogressive modification which suppose that modification to have takenplace by a necessary progress from more to less embryonic forms or frommore to less generalized types within the limits of the periodrepresented by the fossiliferous rocks</s> it negatives those doctrines for it either shows us no evidence of anysuch modification or demonstrates it to have been very slight and asto the nature of that modification it yields no evidence whatsoeverthat the earlier members of any longcontinued group were moregeneralized in structure than the later ones</s>  to a certain extentindeed it may be said that imperfect ossification of the vertebralcolumn is an embryonic character but on the other hand it would beextremely incorrect to suppose that the vertebral columns of the oldervertebrata are in any sense embryonic in their whole structure</s> obviously if the earliest fossiliferous rocks now known are coeval withthe commencement of life and if their contents give us any justconception of the nature and the extent of the earliest fauna and florathe insignificant amount of modification which can be demonstrated tohave taken place in any one group of animals or plants is quiteincompatible with the hypothesis that all living forms are the resultsof a necessary process of progressive development entirely comprisedwithin the time represented by the fossiliferous rocks</s> contrariwise any admissible hypothesis of progressive modificationmust be compatible with persistence without progression throughindefinite periods</s>  and should such an hypothesis eventually be provedto be true in the only way in which it can be demonstrated viz</s>  byobservation and experiment upon the existing forms of life theconclusion will inevitably present itself that the palozoic mesozoicand cainozoic faun and flor taken together bear somewhat the sameproportion to the whole series of living beings which have occupied thisglobe as the existing fauna and flora do to them</s> such are the results of palontology as they appear and have for someyears appeared to the mind of an inquirer who regards that study simplyas one of the applications of the great biological sciences and whodesires to see it placed upon the same sound basis as other branches ofphysical inquiry</s>  if the arguments which have been brought forward arevalid probably no one in

reform</s>   a great reform in geological speculation seems now to have become  necessary</s>   it is quite certain that a great mistake has been madethat  british popular geology at the present time

most fitlydirect your attention in the address which it now becomes my duty todeliver from the presidential chair the two somewhat alarming sentenceswhich i have just read and which occur in an able and interesting essayby an eminent natural philosopher rose into such prominence before mymind that they eclipsed everything else</s> it surely is a matter of paramount importance for the british geologistssome of them very popular geologists too here in solemn annual sessionassembled to inquire whether the severe judgment thus passed upon themby so high an authority as sir william thomson is one to which theymust plead guilty sans phrase or whether they are prepared to saynot guilty and appeal for a reversal of the sentence to that highercourt of educated scientific opinion to which we are all amenable</s> as your attorneygeneral for the time being i thought i could not dobetter than get up the case with a view of advising you</s>  it is true thatthe charges brought forward by the other side involve the considerationof matters quite foreign to the pursuits with which i am ordinarilyoccupied but in that respect i am only in the position which is ninetimes out of ten occupied by counsel who nevertheless contrive to gaintheir causes mainly by force of motherwit and common sense aided bysome training in other intellectual exercises</s> nerved by such precedents i proceed to put my pleading before you</s> and the first question with which i propose to deal is what is it towhich sir w</s>  thomson refers when he speaks of geological speculationand british popular geology</s> i find three more or less contradictory systems of geological thoughteach of which might fairly enough claim these appellations standingside by side in britain</s>  i shall call one of them catastrophism anotheruniformitarianism the third evolutionism and i shall try briefly tosketch the characters of each that you may say whether theclassification is or is not exhaustive</s> by catastrophism i mean any form of geological speculationwhich in order to account for the phnomena of geology supposes theoperation of forces different in their nature or immeasurably differentin power from those which we at present see in action in the universe</s> the mosaic cosmogony is in this sense catastrophic because itassumes the operation of extranatural power</s>  the doctrine of violentupheavals dbcles and cataclysms in general is catastrophic sofar as it assumes that these were brought about by causes which have nowno parallel</s>  there was a time when catastrophism might preeminentlyhave claimed the title of british popular geology and assuredly ithas yet many adherents and reckons among its supporters some of themost honoured members of this society</s> by uniformitarianism i mean especially the teaching of huttonand of lyell</s> that great though incomplete work the theory of the earth seems tome to be one of the most remarkable contributions to geology which isrecorded in the annals of the science</s>  so far as the notliving world isconcerned uniformitarianism lies there not only in germ but inblossom and fruit</s> if one asks how it is that hutton was led to entertain views so far inadvance of those prevalent in his time in some respects while inothers they seem almost curiously limited the answer appears to me tobe plain</s> hutton was in advance of the geological speculation of his timebecause in the first place he had amassed a vast store of knowledge ofthe facts of geology gathered by personal observation in travels ofconsiderable extent and because in the second place he was thoroughlytrained in the physical and chemical science of his day and thuspossessed as much as any one in his time could possess it theknowledge which is requisite for the just interpretation of geologicalphnomena and the habit of thought which fits a man for scientificinquiry</s> it is to this thorough scientific training that i ascribe huttonssteady and persistent refusal to look to other causes than those now inoperation for the explanation of geological phnomena</s> thus he writesi do not pretend as he m</s>  de luc does in histheory to describe the beginning of things</s>  i take things such as ifind them at present and from these i reason with regard to that whichmust have been</s> 40and againa theory of the earth which has for object truth can haveno retrospect to that which had preceded the present order of the worldfor this order alone is what we have to reason upon and to reasonwithout data is nothing but delusion</s>  a theory therefore which islimited to the actual constitution of this earth cannot be allowed toproceed one step beyond the present order of things</s> 41and so clear is he that no causes beside such as are now in operationare needed to account for the character and disposition of thecomponents of the crust of the earth that he says broadly andboldly </s> </s> </s>  there is no part of the earth which has not had the sameorigin so far as this consists in that earth being collected at thebottom of the sea and afterwards produced as land along with massesof melted substances by the operation of mineral causes</s> 42but other influences were at work upon hutton beside those of a mindlogical by nature and scientific by sound training and the peculiarturn which his speculations took seems to me to be unintelligibleunless these be taken into account</s>  the arguments of the frenchastronomers and mathematicians which at the end of the last centurywere held to demonstrate the existence of a compensating arrangementamong the celestial bodies whereby all perturbations eventually reducedthemselves to oscillations on each side of a mean position and thestability of the solar system was secured had evidently taken stronghold of huttons mind</s> in those oddly constructed periods which seem to have prejudiced manypersons against reading his works but which are full of that peculiarif unattractive eloquence which flows from mastery of the subjecthutton sayswe have now got to the end of our reasoning we have no data further toconclude immediately from that which actually is</s>  but we have gotenough we have the satisfaction to find that in nature there iswisdom system and consistency</s>  for having in the natural history ofthis earth seen a succession of worlds we may from this conclude thatthere is a system in nature in like manner as from seeing revolutionsof the planets it is concluded that there is a system by which theyare intended to continue those revolutions</s>  but if the succession ofworlds is established in the system of nature it is in vain to look foranything higher in the origin of the earth</s>  the result therefore ofthis physical inquiry is that we find no vestige of a beginningnoprospect of an end</s> 43yet another influence worked strongly upon hutton</s>  like mostphilosophers of his age he coquetted with those final causes which havebeen named barren virgins but which might be more fitly termed thehetair of philosophy so constantly have they led men astray</s>  thefinal cause of the existence of the world is for hutton the productionof life and intelligence</s> we have now considered the globe of this earth as a machineconstructed upon chemical as well as mechanical principles by which itsdifferent parts are all adapted in form in quality and in quantityto a certain end an end attained with certainty or success and an endfrom which we may perceive wisdom in contemplating the means employed</s> but is this world to be considered thus merely as a machine to last nolonger than its parts retain their present position their proper formsand qualities</s>  or may it not be also considered as an organized body</s> such as has a constitution in which the necessary decay of the machineis naturally repaired in the exertion of those productive powers bywhich it had been formed</s> this is the view in which we are now to examine the globe to see ifthere be in the constitution of this world a reproductive operationby which a ruined constitution may be again repaired and a duration orstability thus procured to the machine considered as a world sustainingplants and animals</s> 44kirwan and the other philistines of the day accused hutton ofdeclaring that his theory implied that the world never had a beginningand never differed in condition from its present state</s>  nothing could bemore grossly unjust as he expressly guards himself against any suchconclusion in the following termsbut in thus tracing back the natural operations which have succeededeach other and mark to us the course of time past we come to a periodin which we cannot see any farther</s>  this however is not the beginningof the operations which proceed in time and according to the wiseeconomy of this world nor is it the establishing of that which in thecourse of time had no beginning it is only the limit of ourretrospective view of those operations which have come to pass in timeand have been conducted by supreme intelligence</s> 45i have spoken of uniformitarianism as the doctrine of hutton and oflyell</s>  if i have quoted the older writer rather than the newer it isbecause his works are little known and his claims on our veneration toofrequently forgotten not because i desire to dim the fame of hiseminent successor</s>  few of the present generation of geologists have readplayfairs illustrations fewer still the original theory of theearth the more is the pity but which of us has not thumbed every pageof the principles of geology</s>  i think that he who writes fairly thehistory of his own progress in geological thought will not be able toseparate his debt to hutton from his obligations to lyell and thehistory of the progress of individual geologists is the history ofgeology</s> no one can doubt that the influence of uniformitarian views has beenenormous and in the main most beneficial and favourable to theprogress of sound geology</s> nor can it be questioned that uniformitarianism has even a strongertitle than catastrophism to call itself the geological speculation ofbritain or if you will british popular geology</s>  for it is eminently abritish doctrine and has even now made comparatively little progresson the continent of europe</s>  nevertheless it seems to me to be open toserious criticism upon one of its aspects</s> i have shown how unjust was the insinuation that hutton denied abeginning to the world</s>  but it would not be unjust to say that hepersistently in practice shut his eyes to the existence of that priorand different state of things which in theory he admitted and inthis aversion to look beyond the veil of stratified rocks lyell followshim</s> hutton and lyell alike agree in their indisposition to carry theirspeculations a step beyond the period recorded in the most ancientstrata now open to observation in the crust of the earth</s>  this is forhutton the point in which we cannot see any farther while lyelltells usthe astronomer may find good reasons for ascribing the earths form tothe original fluidity of the mass in times long antecedent to the firstintroduction of living beings into the planet but the geologist must becontent to regard the earliest monuments which it is his task tointerpret as belonging to a period when the crust had already acquiredgreat solidity and thickness probably as great as it now possesses andwhen volcanic rocks not essentially differing from those now producedwere formed from time to time the intensity of volcanic heat beingneither greater nor less than it is now</s> 46and again as geologists we learn that it is not only the presentcondition of the globe which has been suited to the accommodation ofmyriads of living creatures but that many former states also have beenadapted to the organization and habits of prior races of beings</s>  thedisposition of the seas continents and islands and the climates havevaried the species likewise have been changed and yet they have allbeen so modelled on types analogous to those of existing plants andanimals as to indicate throughout a perfect harmony of design andunity of purpose</s>  to assume that the evidence of the beginning or endof so vast a scheme lies within the reach of our philosophicalinquiries or even of our speculations appears to be inconsistent witha just estimate of the relations which subsist between the finite powersof man and the attributes of an infinite and eternal being</s> 47the limitations implied in these passages appear to me to constitute theweakness and the logical defect of uniformitarianism</s>  no one will imputeblame to hutton that in face of the imperfect condition in his day ofthose physical sciences which furnish the keys to the riddles ofgeology he should have thought it practical wisdom to limit his theoryto an attempt to account for the present order of things but i am ata loss to comprehend why for all time the geologist must be content toregard the oldest fossiliferous rocks as the ultima thule of hisscience or what there is inconsistent with the relations between thefinite and the infinite mind in the assumption that we may discernsomewhat of the beginning or of the end of this speck in space we callour earth</s>  the finite mind is certainly competent to trace out thedevelopment of the fowl within the egg and i know not on what ground itshould find more difficulty in unravelling the complexities of thedevelopment of the earth</s>  in fact as kant has well remarked48 thecosmical process is really simpler than the biological</s> this attempt to limit at a particular point the progress of inductiveand deductive reasoning from the things which are to those whichwerethis faithlessness to its own logic seems to me to have costuniformitarianism the place as the permanent form of geologicalspeculation which it might otherwise have held</s> it remains that i should put before you what i understand to be thethird phase of geological speculationnamely evolutionism</s> i shall not make what i have to say on this head clear unless idiverge or seem to diverge for a while from the direct path of mydiscourse so far as to explain what i take to be the scope of geologyitself</s>  i conceive geology to be the history of the earth in preciselythe same sense as biology is the history of living beings and i trustyou will not think that i am overpowered by the influence of a dominantpursuit if i say that i trace a close analogy between these twohistories</s> if i study a living being under what heads does the knowledge i obtainfall</s>  i can learn its structure or what we call its anatomyand its development or the series of changes which it passesthrough to acquire its complete structure</s>  then i find that the livingbeing has certain powers resulting from its own activities and theinteraction of these with the activities of other thingsthe knowledgeof which is physiology</s>  beyond this the living being has aposition in space and time which is its distribution</s>  allthese form the body of ascertainable facts which constitute the statusquo of the living creature</s>  but these facts have their causes and theascertainment of these causes is the doctrine of tiology</s> if we consider what is knowable about the earth we shall find that suchearthknowledgeif i may so translate the word geologyfalls into thesame categories</s> what is termed stratigraphical geology is neither more nor less than theanatomy of the earth and the history of the succession of theformations is the history of a succession of such anatomies orcorresponds with development as distinct from generation</s> the internal heat of the earth the elevation and depression of itscrust its belchings forth of vapours ashes and lava are itsactivities in as strict a sense as are warmth and the movements andproducts of respiration the activities of an animal</s>  the phnomena ofthe seasons of the trade winds of the gulfstream are as much theresults of the reaction between these inner activities and outwardforces as are the budding of the leaves in spring and their falling inautumn the effects of the interaction between the organization of aplant and the solar light and heat</s>  and as the study of the activitiesof the living being is called its physiology so are these phnomena thesubjectmatter of an analogous telluric physiology to which wesometimes give the name of meteorology sometimes that of physicalgeography sometimes that of geology</s>  again the earth has a place inspace and in time and relations to other bodies in both theserespects which constitute its distribution</s>  this subject is usuallyleft to the astronomer but a knowledge of its broad outlines seems tome to be an essential constituent of the stock of geological ideas</s> all that can be ascertained concerning the structure succession ofconditions actions and position in space of the earth is the matterof fact of its natural history</s>  but as in biology there remains thematter of reasoning from these facts to their causes which is just asmuch science as the other and indeed more and this constitutesgeological tiology</s> having regard to this general scheme of geological knowledge andthought it is obvious that geological speculation may be so to speakanatomical and developmental speculation so far as it relates to pointsof stratigraphical arrangement which are out of reach of directobservation or it may be physiological speculation so far as itrelates to undetermined problems relative to the activities of theearth or it may be distributional speculation if it deals withmodifications of the earths place in space or finally it will betiological speculation if it attempts to deduce the history of theworld as a whole from the known properties of the matter of the earthin the conditions in which the earth has been placed</s> for the purposes of the present discourse i may take this last to bewhat is meant by geological speculation</s> now uniformitarianism as we have seen tends to ignore geologicalspeculation in this sense altogether</s> the one point the catastrophists and the uniformitarians agreed uponwhen this society was founded was to ignore it</s>  and you will find ifyou look back into our records that our revered fathers in geologyplumed themselves a good deal upon the practical sense and wisdom ofthis proceeding</s>  as a temporary measure i do not presume to challengeits wisdom but in all organized bodies temporary changes are apt toproduce permanent effects and as time has slipped by altering all theconditions which may have made such mortification of the scientificflesh desirable i think the effect of the stream of cold water whichhas steadily flowed over geological speculation within these walls hasbeen of doubtful beneficence</s> the sort of geological speculation to which i am now referringgeological tiology in short was created as a science by thatfamous philosopher immanuel kant when in 1755 he wrote his generalnatural history and theory of the celestial bodies or an attempt toaccount for the constitution and the mechanical origin of the universeupon newtonian principles</s> 49in this very remarkable but seemingly littleknown treatise50 kantexpounds a complete cosmogony in the shape of a theory of the causeswhich have led to the development of the universe from diffused atoms ofmatter endowed with simple attractive and repulsive forces</s> give me matter says kant and i will build the world and heproceeds to deduce from the simple data from which he starts a doctrinein all essential respects similar to the wellknown nebular hypothesisof laplace</s> 51 he accounts for the relation of the masses and thedensities of the planets to their distances from the sun for theeccentricities of their orbits for their rotations for theirsatellites for the general agreement in the direction of rotation amongthe celestial bodies for saturns ring and for the zodiacal light</s>  hefinds in each system of worlds indications that the attractive forceof the central mass will eventually destroy its organization byconcentrating upon itself the matter of the whole system but as theresult of this concentration he argues for the development of an amountof heat which will dissipate the mass once more into a molecular chaossuch as that in which it began</s> kant pictures to himself the universe as once an infinite expansion offormless and diffused matter</s>  at one point of this he supposes a singlecentre of attraction set up and by strict deductions from admitteddynamical principles shows how this must result in the development of aprodigious central body surrounded by systems of solar and planetaryworlds in all stages of development</s>  in vivid language he depicts thegreat worldmlstrom widening the margins of its prodigious eddy in theslow progress of millions of ages gradually reclaiming more and more ofthe molecular waste and converting chaos into cosmos</s>  but what isgained at the margin is lost in the centre the attractions of thecentral systems bring their constituents together which then by theheat evolved are converted once more into molecular chaos</s>  thus theworlds that are lie between the ruins of the worlds that have been andthe chaotic materials of the worlds that shall be and in spite of allwaste and destruction cosmos is extending his borders at the expense ofchaos</s> kants further application of his views to the earth itself is to befound in his treatise on physical geography52 a term under whichthe then unknown science of geology was included a subject which hehad studied with very great care and on which he lectured for manyyears</s>  the fourth section of the first part of this treatise is calledhistory of the great changes which the earth has formerly undergone andis still undergoing and is in fact a brief and pregnant essay uponthe principles of geology</s>  kant gives an account first of the gradualchanges which are now taking place under the heads of such as arecaused by earthquakes such as are brought about by rain and riverssuch as are effected by the sea such as are produced by winds andfrost and finally such as result from the operations of man</s> the second part is devoted to the memorials of the changes which theearth has undergone in remote antiquity</s>  these are enumerated asa</s> proofs that the sea formerly covered the whole earth</s>  b</s>  proofs that thesea has often been changed into dry land and then again into sea</s>  c</s>  adiscussion of the varioustheories of the earth put forward byscheuchzer moro bonnet woodward white leibnitz linnus andbuffon</s> the third part contains an attempt to give a sound explanation of theancient history of the earth</s> i suppose that it would be very easy to pick holes in the details ofkants speculations whether cosmological or specially telluric intheir application</s>  but for all that he seems to me to have been thefirst person to frame a complete system of geological speculation byfounding the doctrine of evolution</s> with as much truth as hutton kant could say i take things just as ifind them at present and from these i reason with regard to thatwhich must have been</s>  like hutton he is never tired of pointing outthat in nature there is wisdom system and consistency</s>  and as inthese great principles so in believing that the cosmos has areproductive operation by which a ruined constitution may be repairedhe forestalls hutton while on the other hand kant is true to science</s> he knows no bounds to geological speculation but those of the intellect</s> he reasons back to a beginning of the present state of things he admitsthe possibility of an end</s> i have said that the three schools of geological speculation which ihave termed catastrophism uniformitarianism and evolutionism arecommonly supposed to be antagonistic to one another and i presume itwill have become obvious that in my belief the last is destined toswallow up the other two</s>  but it is proper to remark that each of thelatter has kept alive the tradition of precious truths</s> catastrophism has insisted upon the existence of a practicallyunlimited bank of force on which the theorist might draw and it hascherished the idea of the development of the earth from a state in whichits form and the forces which it exerted were very different fromthose we now know</s>  that such difference of form and power once existedis a necessary part of the doctrine of evolution</s> uniformitarianism on the other hand has with equal justiceinsisted upon a practically unlimited bank of time ready to discountany quantity of hypothetical paper</s>  it has kept before our eyes thepower of the infinitely little time being granted and has compelled usto exhaust known causes before flying to the unknown</s> to my mind there appears to be no sort of necessary theoreticalantagonism between catastrophism and uniformitarianism</s>  on the contraryit is very conceivable that catastrophes may be part and parcel ofuniformity</s>  let me illustrate my case by analogy</s>  the working of a clockis a model of uniform action good timekeeping means uniformity ofaction</s>  but the striking of the clock is essentially a catastrophe thehammer might be made to blow up a barrel of gunpowder or turn on adeluge of water and by proper arrangement the clock instead ofmarking the hours might strike at all sorts of irregular periods nevertwice alike in the intervals force or number of its blows</s> nevertheless all these irregular and apparently lawless catastropheswould be the result of an absolutely uniformitarian action and we mighthave two schools of clocktheorists one studying the hammer and theother the pendulum</s> still less is there any necessary antagonism between either of thesedoctrines and that of evolution which embraces all that is sound inboth catastrophism and uniformitarianism while it rejects the arbitraryassumptions of the one and the as arbitrary limitations of the other</s> nor is the value of the doctrine of evolution to the philosophic thinkerdiminished by the fact that it applies the same method to the living andthe notliving world and embraces in one stupendous analogy thegrowth of a solar system from molecular chaos the shaping of the earthfrom the nebulous cubhood of its youth through innumerable changes andimmeasurable ages to its present form and the development of a livingbeing from the shapeless mass of protoplasm we term a germ</s> i do not know whether evolutionism can claim that amount of currencywhich would entitle it to be called british popular geology but moreor less vaguely it is assuredly present in the minds of mostgeologists</s> such being the three phases of geological speculation we are now in aposition to inquire which of these it is that sir william thomson callsupon us to reform in the passages which i have cited</s> it is obviously uniformitarianism which the distinguished physicisttakes to be the representative of geological speculation in general</s>
 andthus a first issue is raised inasmuch as many persons and those notthe least thoughtful among the younger geologists do not accept strictuniformitarianism as the final form of geological speculation</s>  we shouldsay if hutton and playfair declare the course of the world to have beenalways the same point out the fallacy by all means but in so doingdo not imagine that you are proving modern geology to be in oppositionto natural philosophy</s>  i do not suppose that at the present day anygeologist would be found to maintain absolute uniformitarianism to denythat the rapidity of the rotation of the earth may be diminishingthat the sun may be waxing dim or that the earth itself may becooling</s>  most of us i suspect are gallios who care for none of thesethings being of opinion that true or fictitious they have made nopractical difference to the earth during the period of which a recordis preserved in stratified deposits</s> the accusation that we have been running counter to the principles ofnatural philosophy therefore is devoid of foundation</s>  the onlyquestion which can arise is whether we have or have not been tacitlymaking assumptions which are in opposition to certain conclusions whichmay be drawn from those principles</s>  and this question subdivides itselfinto twothe first are we really contravening such conclusions</s>  thesecond if we are are those conclusions so firmly based that we may notcontravene them</s>  i reply in the negative to both these questions and iwill give you my reasons for so doing</s>  sir william thomson believes thathe is able to prove by physical reasonings that the existing state ofthings on the earth life on the earthall geological history showingcontinuity of lifemust be limited within some such period of time asone hundred million years loc</s>  cit</s>  p</s>  25</s> the first inquiry which arises plainly is has it ever been denied thatthis period may be enough for the purposes of geology</s> the discussion of this question is greatly embarrassed by the vaguenesswith which the assumed limit is i will not say defined butindicatedsome such period of past time as one hundred millionyears</s>  now does this mean that it may have been two or three or fourhundred million years</s>  because this really makes all the difference</s> 53i presume that 100000 feet may be taken as a full allowance for thetotal thickness of stratified rocks containing traces of life 100000divided by 100000000  0</s> 001</s>  consequently the deposit of 100000feet of stratified rock in 100000000 years means that the deposit hastaken place at the rate of 11000 of a foot or say 183 of an inchper annum</s> well i do not know that any one is prepared to maintain that evenmaking all needful allowances the stratified rocks may not have beenformed on the average at the rate of 183 of an inch per annum</s>  isuppose that if such could be shown to be the limit of worldgrowth wecould put up with the allowance without feeling that our speculationshad undergone any revolution</s>  and perhaps after all the qualifyingphrase some such period may not necessitate the assumption of morethan 1166 or 1249 or 1332 of an inch of deposit per year which ofcourse would give us still more ease and comfort</s> but it may be said that it is biology and not geology which asks forso much timethat the succession of life demands vast intervals butthis appears to me to be reasoning in a circle</s>  biology takes her timefrom geology</s>  the only reason we have for believing in the slow rate ofthe change in living forms is the fact that they persist through aseries of deposits which geology informs us have taken a long while tomake</s>  if the geological clock is wrong all the naturalist will have todo is to modify his notions of the rapidity of change accordingly</s>  and iventure to point out that when we are told that the limitation of theperiod during which living beings have inhabited this planet to onetwo or three hundred million years requires a complete revolution ingeological speculation the onus probandi rests on the maker of theassertion who brings forward not a shadow of evidence in its support</s> thus if we accept the limitation of time placed before us by sir w</s> thomson it is not obvious on the face of the matter that we shallhave to alter or reform our ways in any appreciable degree and we maytherefore proceed with much calmness and indeed much indifference asto the result to inquire whether that limitation is justified by thearguments employed in its support</s> these arguments are three in numberi</s>  the first is based upon the undoubted fact that the tides tend toretard the rate of the earths rotation upon its axis</s>  that this must beso is obvious if one considers roughly that the tides result from thepull which the sun and the moon exert upon the sea causing it to act asa sort of break upon the rotating solid earth</s> kant who was by no means a mere abstract philosopher but a goodmathematician and well versed in the physical science of his time notonly proved this in an essay of exquisite clearness and intelligibilitynow more than a century old54 but deduced from it some of its moreimportant consequences such as the constant turning of one face of themoon towards the earth</s> but there is a long step from the demonstration of a tendency to theestimation of the practical value of that tendency which is all withwhich we are at present concerned</s>  the facts bearing on this pointappear to stand as followit is a matter of observation that the moons mean motion is and hasfor the last 3000 years been undergoing an acceleration relatively tothe rotation of the earth</s>  of course this may result from one of twocauses the moon may really have been moving more swiftly in its orbitor the earth may have been rotating more slowly on its axis</s> laplace believed he had accounted for this phnomenon by the fact thatthe eccentricity of the earths orbit has been diminishing throughoutthese 3000 years</s>  this would produce a diminution of the meanattraction of the sun on the moon or in other words an increase inthe attraction of the earth on the moon and consequently an increasein the rapidity of the orbital motion of the latter body</s>  laplacetherefore laid the responsibility of the acceleration upon the moonand if his views were correct the tidal retardation must either beinsignificant in amount or be counteracted by some other agency</s> our great astronomer adams however appears to have found a flaw inlaplaces calculation and to have shown that only half the observedretardation could be accounted for in the way he had suggested</s>  thereremains therefore the other half to be accounted for and here in theabsence of all positive knowledge three sets of hypotheses have beensuggested</s> a m</s>  delaunay suggests that the earth is at fault in consequenceof the tidal retardation</s>  messrs</s>  adams thomson and tait work out thissuggestion and on a certain assumption as to the proportion ofretardations due to the sun and the moon find the earth may losetwentytwo seconds of time in a century from this cause</s> 55b but m</s>  dufour suggests that the retardation of the earth whichis hypothetically assumed to exist may be due in part or wholly tothe increase of the moment of inertia of the earth by meteors fallingupon its surface</s>  this suggestion also meets with the entire approval ofsir w</s>  thomson who shows that meteordust accumulating at the rate ofone foot in 4000 years would account for the remainder ofretardation</s> 56c thirdly sir w</s>  thomson brings forward an hypothesis of his ownwith respect to the cause of the hypothetical retardation of the earthsrotationlet us suppose ice to melt from the polar regions 20 round each polewe may say to the extent of something more than a foot thick enough togive 1</s> 1 foot of water over those areas or 0</s> 006 of a foot of water ifspread over the whole globe which would in reality raise thesealevel by only some such undiscoverable difference as threefourthsof an inch or an inch</s>  this or the reverse which we believe mighthappen any year and could certainly not be detected without far moreaccurate observations and calculations for the mean sealevel than anyhitherto made would slacken or quicken the earths rate as a timekeeperby onetenth of a second per year</s> 57i do not presume to throw the slightest doubt upon the accuracy of anyof the calculations made by such distinguished mathematicians as thosewho have made the suggestions i have cited</s>  on the contrary it isnecessary to my argument to assume that they are all correct</s>  but idesire to point out that this seems to be one of the many cases in whichthe admitted accuracy of mathematical processes is allowed to throw awholly inadmissible appearance of authority over the results obtained bythem</s>  mathematics may be compared to a mill of exquisite workmanshipwhich grinds you stuff of any degree of fineness but neverthelesswhat you get out depends on what you put in and as the grandest mill inthe world will not extract wheatflour from peascods so pages offormul will not get a definite result out of loose data</s> in the present instance it appears to be admitted1</s>  that it is not absolutely certain after all whether the moons meanmotion is undergoing acceleration or the earths rotationretardation</s> 58 and yet this is the key of the whole position</s> 2</s>  if the rapidity of the earths rotation is diminishing it is notcertain how much of that retardation is due to tidal frictionhow muchto meteorshow much to possible excess of melting over accumulation ofpolar ice during the period covered by observation which amounts atthe outside to not more than 2600 years</s> 3</s>  the effect of a different distribution of land and water in modifyingthe retardation caused by tidal friction and of reducing it under somecircumstances to a minimum does not appear to be taken into account</s> 4</s>  during the miocene epoch the polar ice was certainly many feetthinner than it has been during or since the glacial epoch</s>  sir w</s> thomson tells us that the accumulation of something more than a foot ofice around the poles which implies the withdrawal of say an inch ofwater from the general surface of the sea will cause the earth torotate quicker by onetenth of a second per annum</s>  it would appeartherefore that the earth may have been rotating throughout the wholeperiod which has elapsed from the commencement of the glacial epoch downto the present time one or more seconds per annum quicker than itrotated during the miocene epoch</s> but according to sir w</s>  thomsons calculation tidal retardation willonly account for a retardation of 22 in a century or 22100 say 15of a second per annum</s> thus assuming that the accumulation of polar ice since the mioceneepoch has only been sufficient to produce ten times the effect of a coatof ice one foot thick we shall have an accelerating cause which coversall the loss from tidal action and leaves a balance of 45 a second perannum in the way of acceleration</s> if tidal retardation can be thus checked and overthrown by othertemporary conditions what becomes of the confident assertion basedupon the assumed uniformity of tidal retardation that ten thousandmillion years ago the earth must have been rotating more than twice asfast as at present and therefore that we geologists are in directopposition to the principles of natural philosophy if we spreadgeological history over that time</s> ii</s>  the second argument is thus stated by sir w</s>  thomsonan articleby myself published in macmillans magazine for march 1862 on theage of the suns heat explains results of investigation into variousquestions as to possibilities regarding the amount of heat that the suncould have dealing with it as you would with a stone or a piece ofmatter only taking into account the suns dimensions which showed itto be possible that the sun may have already illuminated the earth foras many as one hundred million years but at the same time rendered italmost certain that he had not illuminated the earth for five hundredmillions of years</s>  the estimates here are necessarily very vague butyet vague as they are i do not know that it is possible upon anyreasonable estimate founded on known properties of matter to say thatwe can believe the sun has really illuminated the earth for five hundredmillion years</s> 59i do not wish to hansardize sir william thomson by laying much stresson the fact that only fifteen years ago he entertained a totallydifferent view of the origin of the suns heat and believed that theenergy radiated from year to year was supplied from year to yearadoctrine which would have suited hutton perfectly</s>  but the fact that soeminent a physical philosopher has thus recently held views oppositeto those which he now entertains and that he confesses his ownestimates to be very vague justly entitles us to disregard thoseestimates if any distinct facts on our side go against them</s>  however iam not aware that such facts exist</s>  as i have already said for anythingi know one two or three hundred millions of years may serve the needsof geologists perfectly well</s> iii</s>  the third line of argument is based upon the temperature of theinterior of the earth</s>  sir w</s>  thomson refers to certain investigationswhich prove that the present thermal condition of the interior of theearth implies either a heating of the earth within the last 20000 yearsof as much as 100 f</s>  or a greater heating all over the surface at sometime further back than 20000 years and then proceeds thusnow are geologists prepared to admit that at some time within thelast 20000 years there has been all over the earth so high atemperature as that</s>  i presume not no geologistno moderngeologistwould for a moment admit the hypothesis that the presentstate of underground heat is due to a heating of the surface at so latea period as 20000 years ago</s>  if that is not admitted we are driven toa greater heat at some time more than 20000 years ago</s>  a greaterheating all over the surface than 100 fahrenheit would kill nearly allexisting plants and animals i may safely say</s>  are modern geologistsprepared to say that all life was killed off the earth 50000 100000or 200000 years ago</s>  for the uniformity theory the further back thetime of high surfacetemperature is put the better but the further backthe time of heating the hotter it must have been</s>  the best for thosewho draw most largely on time is that which puts it furthest back andthat is the theory that the heating was enough to melt the whole</s>  buteven if it was enough to melt the whole we must still admit some limitsuch as fifty million years one hundred million years or two or threehundred million years ago</s>  beyond that we cannot go</s> 60it will be observed that the limit is once again of the vaguestranging from 50000000 years to 300000000</s>  and the reply is oncemore that for anything that can be proved to the contrary one or twohundred million years might serve the purpose even of a thoroughgoinghuttonian uniformitarian very well</s> but if on the other hand the 100000000 or 200000000 years appearto be insufficient for geological purposes we must closely criticisethe method by which the limit is reached</s>  the argument is simple enough</s> assuming the earth to be nothing but a cooling mass the quantity ofheat lost per year supposing the rate of cooling to have beenuniform multiplied by any given number of years will be given theminimum temperature that number of years ago</s> but is the earth nothing but a cooling mass like a hotwater jar suchas is used in carriages or a globe of sandstone</s>  and has its coolingbeen uniform</s>  an affirmative answer to both these questions seems to benecessary to the validity of the calculations on which sir w</s>  thomsonlays so much stress</s> nevertheless it surely may be urged that such affirmative answers arepurely hypothetical and that other suppositions have an equal right toconsideration</s> for example is it not possible that at the prodigious temperaturewhich would seem to exist at 100 miles below the surface all themetallic bases may behave as mercury does at a red heat when it refusesto combine with oxygen while nearer the surface and therefore at alower temperature they may enter into combination as mercury does withoxygen a few degrees below its boilingpoint and so give rise to aheat totally distinct from that which they possess as cooling bodies</s> and has it not also been proved by recent researches that the quality ofthe atmosphere may immensely affect its permeability to heat andconsequently profoundly modify the rate of cooling the globe as awhole</s> i do not think it can be denied that such conditions may exist and mayso greatly affect the supply and the loss of terrestrial heat as todestroy the value of any calculations which leave them out of sight</s> my functions as your advocate are at an end</s>  i speak with more than thesincerity of a mere advocate when i express the belief that the caseagainst us has entirely broken down</s>  the cry for reform which has beenraised without is superfluous inasmuch as we have long been reformingfrom within with all needful speed</s>  and the critical examination of thegrounds upon which the very grave charge of opposition to the principlesof natural philosophy has been brought against us rather shows that wehave exercised a wise discrimination in declining for the present tomeddle with our foundations</s>

darwins book or at least has given an opinion upon its merits ordemerits pietists whether lay or ecclesiastic decry it with the mildrailing which sounds so charitable bigots denounce it with ignorantinvective old ladies of both sexes consider it a decidedly dangerousbook and even savans who have no better mud to throw quote antiquatedwriters to show that its author is no better than an ape himself whileevery philosophical thinker hails it as a veritable whitworth gun in thearmory of liberalism and all competent naturalists and physiologistswhatever their opinions as to the ultimate fate of the doctrines putforth acknowledge that the work in which they are embodied is a solidcontribution to knowledge and inaugurates a new epoch in naturalhistory</s> nor has the discussion of the subject been restrained within the limitsof conversation</s>  when the public is eager and interested reviewers mustminister to its wants and the genuine littrateur is too much in thehabit of acquiring his knowledge from the book he judgesas theabyssinian is said to provide himself with steaks from the ox whichcarries himto be withheld from criticism of a profound scientific workby the mere want of the requisite preliminary scientific acquirementwhile on the other hand the men of science who wish well to the newviews no less than those who dispute their validity have naturallysought opportunities of expressing their opinions</s>  hence it is notsurprising that almost all the critical journals have noticed mr</s> darwins work at greater or less length and so many disquisitions ofevery degree of excellence from the poor product of ignorance toooften stimulated by prejudice to the fair and thoughtful essay of thecandid student of nature have appeared that it seems an almosthopeless task to attempt to say anything new upon the question</s> but it may be doubted if the knowledge and acumen of prejudgedscientific opponents or the subtlety of orthodox special pleaders haveyet exerted their full force in mystifying the real issues of the greatcontroversy which has been set afoot and whose end is hardly likely tobe seen by this generation so that at this eleventh hour and evenfailing anything new it may be useful to state afresh that which istrue and to put the fundamental positions advocated by mr</s>  darwin insuch a form that they may be grasped by those whose special studies liein other directions</s>  and the adoption of this course may be the moreadvisable because notwithstanding its great deserts and indeed partlyon account of them the origin of

about the question he has taken up than any man living</s> personally and practically exercised in zoology in minute anatomy ingeology a student of geographical distribution not on maps and inmuseums only but by long voyages and laborious collection havinglargely advanced each of these branches of science and having spentmany years in gathering and sifting materials for his present work thestore of accurately registered facts upon which the author of theorigin of species is able to draw at will is prodigious</s> but this very superabundance of matter must have been embarrassing to awriter who for the present can only put forward an abstract of hisviews and thence it arises perhaps that notwithstanding the clearnessof the style those who attempt fairly to digest the book find much ofit a sort of intellectual pemmicana mass of facts crushed and poundedinto shape rather than held together by the ordinary medium of anobvious logical bond due attention will without doubt discover thisbond but it is often hard to find</s> again from sheer want of room much has to be taken for granted whichmight readily enough be proved and hence while the adept who cansupply the missing links in the evidence from his own knowledgediscovers fresh proof of the singular thoroughness with which alldifficulties have been considered and all unjustifiable suppositionsavoided at every reperusal of mr</s>  darwins pregnant paragraphs thenovice in biology is apt to complain of the frequency of what he fanciesis gratuitous assumption</s> thus while it may be doubted if for some years any one is likely to becompetent to pronounce judgment on all the issues raised by mr</s>  darwinthere is assuredly abundant room for him who assuming the humblerthough perhaps as useful office of an interpreter between the originof species and the public contents himself with endeavouring to pointout the nature of the problems which it discusses to distinguishbetween the ascertained facts and the theoretical views which itcontains and finally to show the extent to which the explanation itoffers satisfies the requirements of scientific logic</s>  at any rate itis this office which we propose to undertake in the following pages</s> it may be safely assumed that our readers have a general conception ofthe nature of the objects to which the word species is applied but ithas perhaps occurred to few even of those who are naturalists exprofesso to reflect that as commonly employed the term has a doublesense and denotes two very different orders of relations</s>  when we call agroup of animals or of plants a species we may imply thereby eitherthat all these animals or plants have some common peculiarity of formor structure or we may mean that they possess some common functionalcharacter</s>  that part of biological science which deals with form andstructure is called morphologythat which concerns itself withfunction physiologyso that we may conveniently speak of these twosenses or aspects of speciesthe one as morphological the other asphysiological</s>  regarded from the former point of view a species isnothing more than a kind of animal or plant which is distinctlydefinable from all others by certain constant and not merely sexualmorphological peculiarities</s>  thus horses form a species because thegroup of animals to which that name is applied is distinguished from allothers in the world by the following constantly associated characters</s> they have 1</s>  a vertebral column 2</s>  mamm 3</s>  a placental embryo 4</s> four legs 5</s>  a single welldeveloped toe in each foot provided with ahoof 6</s>  a bushy tail and 7</s>  callosities on the inner sides of both thefore and the hind legs</s>  the asses again form a distinct speciesbecause with the same characters as far as the fifth in the abovelist all asses have tufted tails and have callosities only on theinner side of the fore legs</s>  if animals were discovered having thegeneral characters of the horse but sometimes with callosities only onthe fore legs and more or less tufted tails or animals having thegeneral characters of the ass but with more or less bushy tails andsometimes with callosities on both pairs of legs besides beingintermediate in other respectsthe two species would have to be mergedinto one</s>  they could no longer be regarded as morphologically distinctspecies for they would not be distinctly definable one from the other</s> however bare and simple this definition of species may appear to be weconfidently appeal to all practical naturalists whether zoologistsbotanists or palontologists to say if in the vast majority of casesthey know or mean to affirm anything more of the group of animals orplants they so denominate than what has just been stated</s>  even the mostdecided advocates of the received doctrines respecting species admitthis</s>   i apprehend says professor owen61 that few naturalists  nowadays in describing and proposing a name for what they call  a new species use that term to signify what was meant by it  twenty or thirty years ago that is an originally distinct  creation maintaining its primitive distinction by obstructive  generative peculiarities</s>  the proposer of the new species now  intends to state no more than he actually knows as for example  that the differences on which he founds the specific character are  constant in individuals of both sexes so far as observation has  reached and that they are not due to domestication or to  artificially superinduced external circumstances or to any outward  influence within his cognizance that the species is wild or is  such as it appears by nature</s> if we consider in fact that by far the largest proportion of recordedexisting species are known only by the study of their skins or bonesor other lifeless exuvia that we are acquainted with none or next tonone of their physiological peculiarities beyond those which can bededuced from their structure or are open to cursory observation andthat we cannot hope to learn more of any of those extinct forms of lifewhich now constitute no inconsiderable proportion of the known flora andfauna of the world it is obvious that the definitions of these speciescan be only of a purely structural or morphological character</s>  it isprobable that naturalists would have avoided much confusion of ideas ifthey had more frequently borne these necessary limitations of ourknowledge in mind</s>  but while it may safely be admitted that we areacquainted with only the morphological characters of the vast majorityof speciesthe

else</s> science will some day show us how this law is a necessary consequence ofthe more general laws which govern matter but for the present more canhardly be said than that it appears to be in harmony with them</s>  we knowthat the phnomena of vitality are not something apart from otherphysical phnomena but one with them and matter and force are the twonames of the one artist who fashions the living as well as the lifeless</s> hence living bodies should obey the same great laws as othermatternor throughout nature is there a law of wider application thanthis that a body impelled by two forces takes the direction of theirresultant</s>  but living bodies may be regarded as nothing but extremelycomplex bundles of forces held in a mass of matter as the complexforces of a magnet are held in the steel by its coercive force andsince the differences of sex are comparatively slight or in otherwords the sum of the forces in each has a very similar tendency theirresultant the offspring may reasonably be expected to deviate butlittle from a course parallel to either or to both</s> represent the reason of the law to ourselves by what physical metaphoror analogy we will however the great matter is to apprehend itsexistence and the importance of the consequences deducible from it</s>  forthings which are like to the same are like to one another and if in agreat series of generations every offspring is like its parent itfollows that all the offspring and all the parents must be like oneanother and that given an original parental stock with theopportunity of undisturbed multiplication the law in questionnecessitates the production in course of time of an indefinitely largegroup the whole of whose members are at once very similar and are bloodrelations having descended from the same parent or pair of parents</s> the proof that all the members of any given group of animals or plantshad thus descended would be ordinarily considered sufficient to entitlethem to the rank of physiological species for most physiologistsconsider species to be definable as the offspring of a single primitivestock</s> but though it is quite true that all those groups we call species mayaccording to the known laws of reproduction have descended from asingle stock and though it is very likely they really have done so yetthis conclusion rests on deduction and can hardly hope to establishitself upon a basis of observation</s>  and the primitiveness of thesupposed single stock which after all is the essential part of thematter is not only a hypothesis but one which has not a shadow offoundation if by primitive be meant independent of any other livingbeing</s>  a scientific definition of which an unwarrantable hypothesisforms an essential part carries its condemnation within itself buteven supposing such a definition were in form tenable thephysiologist who should attempt to apply it in nature would soon findhimself involved in great if not inextricable difficulties</s>  as we havesaid it is indubitable that offspring tend to resemble the parentalorganism but it is equally true that the similarity attained neveramounts to identity either in form or in structure</s>  there is always acertain amount of deviation not only from the precise characters of asingle parent but when as in most animals and many plants the sexesare lodged in distinct individuals from an exact mean between the twoparents</s>  and indeed on general principles this slight deviation seemsas intelligible as the general similarity if we reflect how complex thecooperating bundles of forces are and how improbable it is that inany case their true resultant shall coincide with any mean between themore obvious characters of the two parents</s>  whatever be its causehowever the coexistence of this tendency to minor variation with thetendency to general similarity is of vast importance in its bearing onthe question of the origin of species</s> as a general rule the extent to which an offspring differs from itsparent is slight enough but occasionally the amount of difference ismuch more strongly marked and then the divergent offspring receives thename of a variety</s>  multitudes of what there is every reason to believeare such varieties are known but the origin of very few has beenaccurately recorded and of these we will select two as more especiallyillustrative of the main features of variation</s>  the first of them isthat of the ancon or otter sheep of which a careful account isgiven by colonel david humphreys f</s> r</s> s</s>  in a letter to sir josephbanks published in the philosophical transactions for 1813</s>  it appearsthat one seth wright the proprietor of a farm on the banks of thecharles river in massachusetts possessed a flock of fifteen ewes and aram of the ordinary kind</s>  in the year 1791 one of the ewes presentedher owner with a male lamb differing for no assignable reason fromits parents by a proportionally long body and short bandy legs whenceit was unable to emulate its relatives in those sportive leaps over theneighbours fences in which they were in the habit of indulging muchto the good farmers vexation</s> the second case is that detailed by a no less unexceptionable authoritythan raumur in his art de faire clore les poulets</s>  a maltese couplenamed kelleia whose hands and feet were constructed upon the ordinaryhuman model had born to them a son gratio who possessed six perfectlymoveable fingers on each hand and six toes not quite so well formed oneach foot</s>  no cause could be assigned for the appearance of this unusualvariety of the human species</s> two circumstances are well worthy of remark in both these cases</s>  ineach the variety appears to have arisen in full force and as it wereper saltum a wide and definite difference appearing at once betweenthe ancon ram and the ordinary sheep between the sixfingered andsixtoed gratio kelleia and ordinary men</s>  in neither case is it possibleto point out any obvious reason for the appearance of the variety</s> doubtless there were determining causes for these as for all otherphnomena but they do not appear and we can be tolerably certain thatwhat are ordinarily understood as changes in physical conditions as inclimate in food or the like did not take place and had nothing to dowith the matter</s>  it was no case of what is commonly called adaptation tocircumstances but to use a conveniently erroneous phrase thevariations arose spontaneously</s>  the fruitless search after final causesleads their pursuers a long way but even those hardy teleologists whoare ready to break through all the laws of physics in chase of theirfavourite willothewisp may be puzzled to discover what purposecould be attained by the stunted legs of seth wrights ram or thehexadactyle members of gratio kelleia</s> varieties then arise we know not why and it is more than probable thatthe majority of varieties have arisen in this spontaneous mannerthough we are of course far from denying that they may be traced insome cases to distinct external influences which are assuredlycompetent to alter the character of the tegumentary covering to changecolour to increase or diminish the size of muscles to modifyconstitution and among plants to give rise to the metamorphosis ofstamens into petals and so forth</s>  but however they may have arisenwhat especially interests us at present is to remark that once inexistence varieties obey the fundamental law of reproduction that liketends to produce like and their offspring exemplify it by tending toexhibit the same deviation from the parental stock as themselves</s> indeed there seems to be in many instances a prepotent influenceabout a newlyarisen variety which gives it what one may call an unfairadvantage over the normal descendants from the same stock</s>  this isstrikingly exemplified by the case of gratio kelleia who married awoman with the ordinary pentadactyle extremities and had by her fourchildren salvator george andr and marie</s>  of these childrensalvator the eldest boy had six fingers and six toes like his fatherthe second and third also boys had five fingers and five toes liketheir mother though the hands and feet of george were slightlydeformed the last a girl had five fingers and five toes but thethumbs were slightly deformed</s>  the variety thus reproduced itself purelyin the eldest while the normal type reproduced itself purely in thethird and almost purely in the second and last so that it would seemat first as if the normal type were more powerful than the variety</s>  butall these children grew up and intermarried with normal wives andhusband and then note what took place salvator had four childrenthree of whom exhibited the hexadactyle members of their grandfather andfather while the youngest had the pentadactyle limbs of the mother andgrandmother so that here notwithstanding a double pentadactyledilution of the blood the hexadactyle variety had the best of it</s>  thesame prepotency of the variety was still more markedly exemplified inthe progeny of two of the other children marie and george</s>  marie whosethumbs only were deformed gave birth to a boy with six toes and threeother normally formed children but george who was not quite so pure apentadactyle begot first two girls each of whom had six fingers andtoes then a girl with six fingers on each hand and six toes on theright foot but only five toes on the left and lastly a boy with onlyfive fingers and toes</s>  in these instances therefore the variety as itwere leaped over one generation to reproduce itself in full force inthe next</s>  finally the purely pentadactyle andr was the father of manychildren not one of whom departed from the normal parental type</s> if a variation which approaches the nature of a monstrosity can strivethus forcibly to reproduce itself it is not wonderful that lessaberrant modifications should tend to be preserved even more stronglyand the history of the ancon sheep is in this respect particularlyinstructive</s>  with the cuteness characteristic of their nation theneighbours of the massachusetts farmer imagined it would be an excellentthing if all his sheep were imbued with the stayathome tendenciesenforced by nature upon the newlyarrived ram and they advised wrightto kill the old patriarch of his fold and install the ancon ram in hisplace</s>  the result justified their sagacious anticipations and coincidedvery nearly with what occurred to the progeny of gratio kelleia</s>  theyoung lambs were almost always either pure ancons or pure ordinarysheep</s> 62 but when sufficient ancon sheep were obtained to interbreedwith one another it was found that the offspring was always pure ancon</s> colonel humphreys in fact states that he was acquainted with only onequestionable case of a contrary nature</s>  here then is a remarkable andwellestablished instance not only of a very distinct race beingestablished per saltum but of that race breeding true at once andshowing no mixed forms even when crossed with another breed</s> by taking care to select ancons of both sexes for breeding from itthus became easy to establish an extremely wellmarked race so peculiarthat even when herded with other sheep it was noted that the anconskept together</s>  and there is every reason to believe that the existenceof this breed might have been indefinitely protracted but theintroduction of the merino sheep which were not only very superior tothe ancons in wool and meat but quite as quiet and orderly led to thecomplete neglect of the new breed so that in 1813 colonel humphreysfound it difficult to obtain the specimen whose skeleton was presentedto sir joseph banks</s>  we believe that for many years no remnant of ithas existed in the united states</s> gratio kelleia was not the progenitor of a race of sixfingered men asseth wrights ram became a nation of ancon sheep though the tendency ofthe variety to perpetuate itself appears to have been fully as strongin the one case as in the other</s>  and the reason of the difference is notfar to seek</s>  seth wright took care not to weaken the ancon blood bymatching his ancon ewes with any but males of the same variety whilegratio kelleias sons were too far removed from the patriarchal times tointermarry with their sisters and his grandchildren seem not to havebeen attracted by their sixfingered cousins</s>  in other words in the oneexample a race was produced because for several generations care wastaken to select both parents of the breeding stock from animalsexhibiting a tendency to vary in the same direction while in theother no race was evolved because no such selection was exercised</s>  arace is a propagated variety and as by the laws of reproductionoffspring tend to assume the parental form they will be more likely topropagate a variation exhibited by both parents than that possessed byonly one</s> there is no organ of the body of an animal which may not and does notoccasionally vary more or less from the normal type and there is novariation which may not be transmitted and which if selectivelytransmitted may not become the foundation of a race</s>  this great truthsometimes forgotten by philosophers has long been familiar to practicalagriculturists and breeders and upon it rest all the methods ofimproving the breeds of domestic animals which for the last centuryhave been followed with so much success in england</s>  colour form sizetexture of hair or wool proportions of

characters whose transmission isnot an everyday occurrence within the experience of cattlebreedersstockfarmers horsedealers and dog and poultry fanciers</s>  nay it isonly the other day that an eminent physiologist dr</s>  brownsquardcommunicated to the royal society his discovery that epilepsyartificially produced in guineapigs by a means which he hasdiscovered is transmitted to their offspring</s> but a race once produced is no more a fixed and immutable entity thanthe stock whence it sprang variations arise among its members and asthese variations are transmitted like any others new races may bedeveloped out of the preexisting ones ad infinitum or at leastwithin any limit at present determined</s>  given sufficient time andsufficiently careful selection and the multitude of races which mayarise from a common stock is as astonishing as are the extremestructural differences which they may present</s>  a remarkable example ofthis is to be found in the rockpigeon which mr</s>  darwin has in ouropinion satisfactorily demonstrated to be the progenitor of all ourdomestic pigeons of which there are certainly more than a hundredwellmarked races</s>  the most noteworthy of these races are the fourgreat stocks known to the fancy as tumblers pouters carriers andfantails birds which not only differ most singularly in size colourand habits but in the form of the beak and of the skull in theproportions of the beak to the skull in the number of tailfeathers inthe absolute and relative size of the feet in the presence or absenceof the uropygial gland in the number of vertebr in the back in shortin precisely those characters in which the genera and species of birdsdiffer from one another</s> and it is most remarkable and instructive to observe that none of theseraces can be shown to have been originated by the action of changes inwhat are commonly called external circumstances upon the wildrockpigeon</s>  on the contrary from time immemorial pigeon fanciers havehad essentially similar methods of treating their pets which have beenhoused fed protected and cared for in much the same way in allpigeonries</s>  in fact there is no case better adapted than that of thepigeons to refute the doctrine which one sees put forth on highauthority that no other characters than those founded on thedevelopment of bone for the attachment of muscles are capable ofvariation</s>  in precise contradiction of this hasty assertion mr</s> darwins researches prove that the skeleton of the wings in domesticpigeons has hardly varied at all from that of the wild type while onthe other hand it is in exactly those respects such as the relativelength of the beak and skull the number of the vertebr and the numberof the tailfeathers in which muscular exertion can have no importantinfluence that the utmost amount of variation has taken place</s> we have said that the following out of the properties exhibited byphysiological species would lead us into difficulties and at this pointthey begin to be obvious for if as a result of spontaneous variationand of selective breeding the progeny of a common stock may becomeseparated into groups distinguished from one another by constant notsexual morphological characters it is clear that the physiologicaldefinition of species is likely to clash with the morphologicaldefinition</s>  no one would hesitate to describe the pouter and the tumbleras distinct species if they were found fossil or if their skins andskeletons were imported as those of exotic wild birds commonlyareand without doubt if considered alone they are good and distinctmorphological species</s>  on the other hand they are not physiologicalspecies for they are descended from a common stock the rockpigeon</s> under these circumstances as it is admitted on all sides that racesoccur in nature how are we to know whether any apparently distinctanimals are really of different physiological species or not seeingthat the amount of morphological difference is no safe guide</s>  is thereany test of a physiological species</s>  the usual answer of physiologistsis in the affirmative</s>  it is said that such a test is to be found in thephnomena of hybridizationin the results of crossing races ascompared with the results of crossing species</s> so far as the evidence goes at present individuals of what arecertainly known to be mere races produced by selection however distinctthey may appear to be not only breed freely together but the offspringof such crossed races are only perfectly fertile with one another</s>  thusthe spaniel and the greyhound the drayhorse and the arab the pouterand the tumbler breed together with perfect freedom and theirmongrels if matched with other mongrels of the same kind are equallyfertile</s> on the other hand there can be no doubt that the individuals of manynatural species are either absolutely infertile if crossed withindividuals of other species or if they give rise to hybrid offspringthe hybrids so produced are infertile when paired together</s>  the horseand the ass for instance if so crossed give rise to the mule andthere is no certain evidence of offspring ever having been produced by amale and female mule</s>  the unions of the rockpigeon and the ringpigeonappear to be equally barren of result</s>  here then says thephysiologist we have a means of distinguishing any two true speciesfrom any two varieties</s>  if a male and a female selected from eachgroup produce offspring and that offspring is fertile with othersproduced in the same way the groups are races and not species</s>  if onthe other hand no result ensues or if the offspring are infertile withothers produced in the same way they are true physiological species</s> the test would be an admirable one if in the first place it werealways practicable to apply it and if in the second it alwaysyielded results susceptible of a definite interpretation</s>  unfortunatelyin the great majority of cases this touchstone for species is whollyinapplicable</s> the constitution of many wild animals is so altered by confinement thatthey will not breed even with their own females so that the negativeresults obtained from crosses are of no value and the antipathy of wildanimals of different species for one another or even of wild and tamemembers of the same species is ordinarily so great that it is hopelessto look for such unions in nature</s>  the hermaphrodism of most plants thedifficulty in the way of ensuring the absence of their own or theproper working of other pollen are obstacles of no less magnitude inapplying the test to them</s>  and in both animals and plants is superaddedthe further difficulty that experiments must be continued over a longtime for the purpose of ascertaining the fertility of the mongrel orhybrid progeny as well as of the first crosses from which they spring</s> not only do these great practical difficulties lie in the way ofapplying the hybridization test but even when this oracle can bequestioned its replies are sometimes as doubtful as those of delphi</s> for example cases are cited by mr</s>  darwin of plants which are morefertile with the pollen of another species than with their own andthere are others such as certain fuci whose male element willfertilize the ovule of a plant of distinct species while the males ofthe latter species are ineffective with the females of the first</s>  sothat in the lastnamed instance a physiologist who should cross thetwo species in one way would decide that they were true species whileanother who should cross them in the reverse way would with equaljustice according to the rule pronounce them to be mere races</s>  severalplants which there is great reason to believe are mere varieties arealmost sterile when crossed while both animals and plants which havealways been regarded by naturalists as of distinct species turn outwhen the test is applied to be perfectly fertile</s>  again the sterilityor fertility of crosses seems to bear no relation to the structuralresemblances or differences of the members of any two groups</s> mr</s>  darwin has discussed this question with singular ability andcircumspection and his conclusions are summed up as follow at page 276of his work  first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as  species and their hybrids are very generally but not  universally sterile</s>  the sterility is of all degrees and is often  so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever  lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking  forms by this test</s>  the sterility is innately variable in  individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of  favourable and unfavourable conditions</s>  the degree of sterility  does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by  several curious and complex laws</s>  it is generally different and  sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same  two species</s>  it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and  in the hybrid produced from this cross</s>   in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one  species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally  unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing  the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another  is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems</s>   there is no more reason to think that species have been specially  endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing  and breeding in nature than to think that trees have been  specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of  difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them  becoming inarched in our forests</s>   the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have  their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several  circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the  embryo</s>  the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive  systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole  organization disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species  seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects  pure species when their natural conditions of life have been  disturbed</s>  this view is supported by a parallelism of another kind  namely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is  favourable to the vigour and fertility of the offspring and that  slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable  to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings</s>  it is not  surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species  and the degree of sterility of their hybrid offspring should  generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both  depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species  which are crossed</s>  nor is it surprising that the facility of  effecting a first cross the fertility of hybrids produced from it  and the capacity of being grafted togetherthough this latter  capacity evidently depends on widely different  circumstancesshould all run to a certain extent parallel with the  systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment  for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of  resemblance between all species</s>   first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently  alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring  are very generally but not quite universally fertile</s>  nor is this  nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember  how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in  a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of  varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection  of mere external differences and not of differences in the  reproductive system</s>  in all other respects excluding fertility  there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and  mongrels</s> pp</s>  2768</s> we fully agree with the general tenor of this weighty passage butforcible as are these arguments and little as the value of fertility orinfertility as a test of species may be it must not be forgotten thatthe really important fact so far as the inquiry into the origin ofspecies goes is that there are such things in nature as groups ofanimals and of plants whose members are incapable of fertile union withthose of other groups and that there are such things as hybrids whichare absolutely sterile when crossed with other hybrids</s>  for if suchphnomena as these were exhibited by only two of those assemblages ofliving objects to which the name of species whether it be used in itsphysiological or in its morphological sense is given it would have tobe accounted for by any theory of the origin of species and everytheory which could not account for it would be so far imperfect</s> up to this point we have been dealing with matters of fact and thestatements which we have laid before the reader would to the best ofour knowledge be admitted to contain a fair exposition of what is atpresent known respecting the essential properties of species by all whohave studied the question</s>  and whatever may be his theoretical views nonaturalist will probably be disposed to demur to the following summaryof that expositionliving beings whether animals or plants are divisible into multitudesof distinctly definable kinds which are morphological species</s>  they arealso divisible into groups of individuals which breed freely togethertending to reproduce their like and are physiological species</s>  normallyresembling their parents the offspring of members of these species arestill liable to vary and the variation may be perpetuated by selectionas a race which race in many cases presents all the characteristicsof a morphological species</s>  but it is not as yet proved that a race everexhibits when crossed with another race of the same species thosephnomena of hybridization which are exhibited by many species whencrossed with other species</s>  on the other hand not only is it notproved that all species give rise to hybrids infertile inter se butthere is much reason to believe that in crossing species exhibit everygradation from perfect sterility to perfect fertility</s> such are the most essential characteristics of species</s>  even were mannot one of thema member of the

the origin of species which profess to standupon a scientific basis and as such alone demand serious attentionare of two kinds</s>  the one the special creation hypothesis presumesevery species to have originated from one or more stocks these notbeing the result of the modification of any other form of livingmatteror arising by natural agenciesbut being produced as such bya supernatural creative act</s> the other the socalled transmutation hypothesis considers that allexisting species are the result of the modification of preexistingspecies and those of their predecessors by agencies similar to thosewhich at the present day produce varieties and races and therefore inan altogether natural way and it is a probable though not a necessaryconsequence of this hypothesis that all living beings have arisen froma single stock</s>  with respect to the origin of this primitive stock orstocks the doctrine of the origin of species is obviously notnecessarily concerned</s>  the transmutation hypothesis for example isperfectly consistent either with the conception of a special creation ofthe primitive germ or with the supposition of its having arisen as amodification of inorganic matter by natural causes</s> the doctrine of special creation owes its existence very largely to thesupposed necessity of making science accord with the hebrew cosmogonybut it is curious to observe that as the doctrine is at presentmaintained by men of science it is as hopelessly inconsistent with thehebrew view as any other hypothesis</s> if there be any result which has come more clearly out of geologicalinvestigation than another it is that the vast series of extinctanimals and plants is not divisible as it was once supposed to be intodistinct groups separated by sharply

of his profound study of plants and of the lowerforms of animal life lamarck whose general line of thought oftenclosely resembles that of de maillet made a great advance upon thecrude and merely speculative manner in which that writer deals with thequestion of the origin of living beings by endeavouring to findphysical causes competent to effect that change of one species intoanother which de maillet had only supposed to occur</s>  and lamarckconceived that he had found in nature such causes amply sufficient forthe purpose in view</s>  it is a physiological fact he says that organsare

willchange its structure by increasing the development of the parts newlybrought into use and by the diminution of those less used but byaltering the circumstances which surround it you will alter its

ofcircumstance upon those primitive germs which he considered to haveoriginally arisen by spontaneous generation within the waters of theglobe</s>  it is curious however that lamarck should insist

nutritiveprocesses which are effected by changing circumstances and it does notseem to have occurred to him that such changes might be as well supposedto take place among animals</s> when we have said that lamarck felt that mere speculation was not theway to arrive at the origin of species but that it was necessary inorder to the establishment of any sound theory on the subject todiscover by observation or otherwise some vera causa competent togive rise to them that he affirmed the true order of classification tocoincide with the order of their development one from another that heinsisted

to carry it</s>  on the other hand however much the few who thoughtdeeply on the question of species might be repelled by the generallyreceived dogmas they saw no way of escaping from them save by theadoption of suppositions so little justified by experiment or byobservation as to be at least equally distasteful</s> the choice lay between two absurdities and a middle condition of uneasyscepticism which last however unpleasant and unsatisfactory wasobviously the only justifiable state of mind under the circumstances</s> such being the general ferment in the minds of naturalists

which containing a development of the very same views hadbeen perused by his private friends fifteen or sixteen years before</s> perplexed in what manner to do full justice both to his friend and tohimself mr</s>  darwin placed the matter in the hands of dr</s>  hooker and sircharles lyell by whose advice he communicated a brief abstract of hisown views to the linnan society at the same time that mr</s>  wallacespaper was read</s>  of that abstract the work on the origin of species isan enlargement but a complete statement of mr</s>  darwins doctrine islooked for in the large and wellillustrated work which he is said to bepreparing for publication</s> the darwinian hypothesis has the merit of being eminently simple andcomprehensible in principle and its essential positions may be statedin a very few words all species have been produced by the developmentof varieties from common stocks by the conversion of these first intopermanent races and then into new species by the process of naturalselection which process is essentially identical with that artificialselection by which man has originated the races of domestic animalsthestruggle for existence taking the place of man and exerting in thecase of natural selection that selective action which he performs inartificial selection</s> the evidence brought forward by mr</s>  darwin in support of his hypothesisis of three kinds</s>  first he endeavours to prove that species may beoriginated by selection secondly he attempts to show that naturalcauses are competent to exert selection and thirdly he tries to provethat the most remarkable and apparently anomalous phnomena exhibited bythe distribution development and mutual relations of species can beshown to be deducible from the general doctrine of their origin whichhe propounds combined with the known facts of geological change andthat even if all these phnomena are not at present explicable by itnone are necessarily inconsistent with it</s> there cannot be a doubt that the method of inquiry which mr</s>  darwin hasadopted is not only rigorously in accordance with the canons ofscientific logic but that it is the only adequate method</s>  criticsexclusively trained in classics or in mathematics who have neverdetermined a scientific fact in their lives by induction from experimentor observation prate learnedly about mr</s>  darwins method which is notinductive enough not baconian enough forsooth for them</s>  but even ifpractical acquaintance with the process of scientific investigation isdenied them they may learn by the perusal of mr</s>  mills admirablechapter on the deductive method that there are multitudes ofscientific inquiries in which the method of pure induction helps theinvestigator but a very little way</s>   the mode of investigation says mr</s>  mill which from the proved  inapplicability of direct methods of observation and experiment  remains to us as the main source of the knowledge we possess or  can acquire respecting the conditions and laws of recurrence of  the more complex phnomena is called in its most general  expression the deductive method and consists of three operations  the first one of direct induction the second of ratiocination  and the third of verification</s> now the conditions which have determined the existence of species arenot only exceedingly complex but so far as the great majority of themare concerned are necessarily beyond our cognizance</s>  but what mr</s> darwin has attempted to do is in exact accordance with the rule laiddown by mr</s>  mill he has endeavoured to determine certain great factsinductively by observation and experiment he has then reasoned fromthe data thus furnished and lastly he has tested the validity of hisratiocination by

climate duringan indefinite period</s>  and this explanation or coincidence of observedwith deduced facts is so far as it extends a verification of thedarwinian view</s> there is no fault to be found with mr</s>  darwins method then but it isanother question whether he has fulfilled all the conditions imposed bythat method</s>  is it satisfactorily proved in fact that species may beoriginated by selection</s>  that there is such a thing as naturalselection</s>  that none of the phnomena exhibited by species areinconsistent with the origin of species in this way</s>  if these questionscan be answered in the affirmative mr</s>  darwins view steps out of theranks of hypotheses into those of proved theories but so long as theevidence at present adduced falls short of enforcing that affirmationso long to our minds must the new doctrine be content to remain amongthe formeran extremely valuable and in the highest degree probabledoctrine indeed the only extant hypothesis which is worth anything in ascientific point of view but still a hypothesis and not yet the theoryof species</s> after much consideration and with assuredly no bias against mr</s> darwins views it is our clear conviction that as the evidence standsit is not absolutely proven that a group of animals having all thecharacters exhibited by species in nature has ever been originated byselection whether artificial or natural</s>  groups having themorphological character of species distinct and permanent races infact have been so produced over and over again but there is nopositive evidence at present that any group of animals has byvariation and selective breeding given rise to another group which waseven in the least degree infertile with the first</s>  mr</s>  darwin isperfectly aware of this weak point and brings forward a multitude ofingenious and important arguments to diminish the force of theobjection</s>  we admit the value of these arguments to their fullestextent nay we will go so far as to express our belief thatexperiments conducted by a skilful physiologist would very probablyobtain the desired production of mutually more or less infertile breedsfrom a common stock in a

objection to the lamarckian hypothesis of thetransmutation of species is based upon the absence of transitional formsbetween many species</s>  but against the darwinian hypothesis this argumenthas no force</s>  indeed one of the most valuable and suggestive parts ofmr</s>  darwins work is that in which he proves that the frequent absenceof transitions is a necessary consequence of his doctrine and that thestock whence two or more species have sprung need in no respect beintermediate between these species</s>  if any two species have arisen froma common stock in the same way as the carrier and the pouter say havearisen from the rockpigeon then the common stock of these two speciesneed be no more intermediate between the two than the rockpigeon isbetween the carrier and pouter</s>  clearly appreciate the force of thisanalogy and all the arguments against the origin of species byselection based on the absence of transitional forms fall to theground</s>  and mr</s>  darwins position might we think have been evenstronger than it is if he had not embarrassed himself with the aphorismnatura non facit saltum which turns up so often in his pages</s>  webelieve as we have said above that

sufficiently perfect for the  purpose it serves and in that at least it is useless to seek for  a cause of its improvement</s> it is singular how differently one and the same book will

contrived to that end on theground that the only cause we know of competent to produce such aneffect as a watch which shall keep time is a contriving intelligenceadapting the means directly to that end</s> suppose however that any one had been able to show that the watch hadnot been made directly by any person but that it was the result of themodification of another watch which kept time but poorly and that thisagain had proceeded from a structure which could hardly be called awatch at allseeing that it had no figures on the dial and the handswere rudimentary and that going back and back in time we came at lastto a revolving barrel as the earliest traceable rudiment of the wholefabric</s>  and imagine that it had been possible to show that all thesechanges had resulted first from a tendency of the structure to varyindefinitely and secondly from something in the surrounding worldwhich helped all variations in the direction of an accurate timekeeperand checked all those in other directions then it is obvious that theforce of paleys argument would be gone</s>  for it would be demonstratedthat an apparatus thoroughly well adapted to a particular purpose mightbe the result of a method of trial and error worked by unintelligentagents as well as of the direct application of the means appropriate tothat end by an intelligent agent</s> now it appears to us that what we have here

every organism are perfect andcannot be improved the darwinian theory simply affirms that they workwell enough to enable the organism to hold its own against suchcompetitors as it has met with but admits the possibility of indefiniteimprovement</s>  but an example may bring into clearer light the profoundopposition between the ordinary teleological and the darwinianconception</s> cats catch

adjusted that no one of their organs could be alteredwithout the change involving the alteration of all the rest</s>  darwinismaffirms on the contrary that there was no express constructionconcerned in the matter but that among the multitudinous variations ofthe feline stock many of which died out from want of power to resistopposing influences some the cats were better fitted to catch micethan others whence they throve and persisted in proportion to theadvantage over their fellows thus offered to them</s> far from imagining that cats exist in order to catch mice welldarwinism supposes that cats exist because they catch micewellmousing being not the end but the condition of their existence</s> and if the cattype has long persisted as we know it the interpretationof the fact upon darwinian principles would be not that the cats haveremained invariable but that such varieties as have incessantlyoccurred have been on the whole less fitted to get on in the worldthan the existing stock</s> if we apprehend the spirit of the origin of species rightly thennothing can be more entirely and absolutely opposed to teleology as itis commonly understood than the darwinian theory</s>  so far from being ateleologist in the fullest sense of the word we should deny that heis a teleologist in the ordinary sense at all and we should say thatapart from his merits as a naturalist he has rendered a most remarkableservice to philosophical thought by enabling the student of nature torecognise to their fullest extent those adaptations to purpose whichare so striking in the organic world and which teleology has done goodservice in keeping before our minds without being false to thefundamental principles of a scientific conception of the universe</s>  theapparently diverging teachings of the teleologist and of themorphologist are reconciled by the darwinian hypothesis</s> but leaving our own impressions of the origin of species and turningto those passages specially cited by professor klliker we cannot admitthat they bear the interpretation he puts upon them</s>  darwin if we readhim rightly does not affirm that every detail in the structure of ananimal has been created for its benefit</s>  his words are p</s>  199  the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest  lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine  that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of  its possessor</s>  they believe that very many structures have been  created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety</s>  this  doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theoryyet i  fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their  possessor</s> and after sundry illustrations and qualifications he concludes p</s> 200  hence every detail of structure in every living creature making  some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions  may be viewed either as having been of special use to some  ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants  of this formeither directly or indirectly through the complex  laws of growth</s> but it is one thing to say darwinically that every detail observed inan animals structure is of use to it or has been of use to itsancestors and quite another to affirm teleologically that everydetail of an animals structure has been created for its benefit</s>  on theformer hypothesis for example the teeth of the foetal balna havea meaning on the latter none</s>  so far as we are aware there is not aphrase in the origin of species inconsistent with professorkllikers position that varieties arise irrespectively of the notionof purpose or of utility according to general laws of nature and maybe either useful or hurtful or indifferent</s> on the contrary mr</s>  darwin writes summary of chap</s>  v</s>   our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound</s>  not in one  case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this  or that part varies more or less from the same part in the  parents</s> </s> </s> </s>  the external conditions of life as climate and food  c</s>  seem to have induced some slight modifications</s>  habit in  producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening  and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been  more potent in their effects</s> and finally as if to prevent all possible misconception mr</s>  darwinconcludes his chapter on variation with these pregnant words  whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the  offspring from their parentsand a cause for each must existit  is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such  differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to  all the more important modifications of structure by which the  innumerable beings on the face of the earth are enabled to struggle  with each other and the best adapted to survive</s> we have dwelt at length upon this subject because of its great generalimportance and because we believe that professor kllikers criticismson this head are based upon a misapprehension of mr</s>  darwinsviewssubstantially they appear to us to coincide with his own</s>  theother objections which professor klliker enumerates and discusses arethe following66  1</s>  no transitional forms between existing species are known and  known varieties whether selected or spontaneous never go so far  as to establish new species</s> to this professor klliker appears to attach some weight</s>  he makes thesuggestion that the shortfaced tumbler pigeon may be a pathologicalproduct</s>   2</s>  no transitional forms of animals are met with among the organic  remains of earlier epochs</s> upon this professor klliker remarks that the absence of transitionalforms in the fossil world though not necessarily fatal to darwinsviews weakens his case</s>   3</s>  the struggle for existence does not take place</s> to this objection urged by pelzeln klliker very justly attaches noweight</s>   4</s>  a tendency of organisms to give rise to useful varieties and a  natural selection do not exist</s>   the varieties which are found arise in consequence of manifold  external influences and it is not obvious why they all or  partially should be particularly useful</s>  each animal suffices for  its own ends is perfect of its kind and needs no further  development</s>  should however a variety be useful and even maintain  itself there is no obvious reason why it should change any  further</s>  the whole conception of the imperfection of organisms and  the necessity of their becoming perfected is plainly the weakest  side of darwins theory and a pis aller nothbehelf because  darwin could think of no other principle by which to explain the  metamorphoses which as i also believe have occurred</s> here again we must venture to dissent completely from professorkllikers conception of mr</s>  darwins hypothesis</s>  it appears to us to beone of the many peculiar merits of that hypothesis that it involves nobelief in a necessary and continual progress of organisms</s> again mr</s>  darwin if we read him aright assumes no special tendency oforganisms to give rise to useful varieties and knows nothing of needsof development or necessity of perfection</s>  what he says is insubstance all organisms vary</s>  it is in the highest degree improbablethat any given variety should have exactly the same relations tosurrounding conditions as the parent stock</s>  in that case it is eitherbetter fitted when the variation may be called useful or worsefitted to cope with them</s>  if better it will tend to supplant theparent stock if worse it will tend to be extinguished by the parentstock</s> if as is hardly conceivable the new variety is so perfectly adapted tothe conditions that no improvement upon it is possibleit willpersist because though it does not cease to vary the varieties willbe inferior to itself</s> if as is more probable the new variety is by no means perfectlyadapted to its conditions but only fairly well adapted to them it willpersist so long as none of the varieties which it throws off arebetter adapted than itself</s> on the other hand as soon as it varies in a useful way i</s> e</s>  when thevariation is such as to adapt it more perfectly to its conditions thefresh variety will tend to supplant the former</s> so far from a gradual progress towards perfection forming any necessarypart of the darwinian creed it appears to us that it is perfectlyconsistent with indefinite persistence in one state or with a gradualretrogression</s>  suppose for example a return of the glacial epoch and aspread of polar climatal conditions over the whole globe</s>  the operationof natural selection under these circumstances would tend on the wholeto the weeding out of the higher organisms and the cherishing of thelower forms of life</s>  cryptogamic vegetation would have the advantageover phanerogamic hydrozoa over corals crustacea over insectaand amphipoda and isopoda over the higher crustacea cetaceans andseals over the primates the civilization of the esquimaux over thatof the european</s>   5</s>  pelzeln has also objected that if the later organisms have  proceeded from the earlier the whole developmental series from  the simplest to the highest could not now exist in such a case  the simpler organisms must have disappeared</s> to this professor klliker replies with perfect justice that theconclusion drawn by pelzeln does not really follow from darwinspremises and that if we take the facts of palontology as they standthey rather support than oppose darwins theory</s>   6</s>  great weight must be attached to the objection brought forward  by huxley otherwise a warm supporter of darwins hypothesis that  we know of no varieties which are sterile with one another as is  the rule among sharply distinguished animal forms</s>   if darwin is right it must be demonstrated that forms may be  produced by selection which like the present sharply  distinguished animal forms are infertile when coupled with one  another and this has not been done</s> the weight of this objection is obvious but our ignorance of theconditions of fertility and sterility the want of carefully conductedexperiments extending over long series of years and the strangeanomalies presented by the results of the crossfertilization of manyplants should all as mr</s>  darwin has urged be taken into account inconsidering it</s> the seventh objection is that we have already discussed supr p</s> 329</s> the eighth and last stands as follows  8</s>  the developmental theory of darwin is not needed to enable us  to understand the regular harmonious progress of the complete  series of organic forms from the simpler to the more perfect</s>   the existence of general laws of nature explains this harmony  even if we assume that all beings have arisen separately and  independent of one another</s>  darwin forgets that inorganic nature  in which there can be no thought of a genetic connexion of forms  exhibits the same regular plan the same harmony as the organic  world and that to cite only one example there is as much a  natural system of minerals as of plants and animals</s> we do not feel quite sure that we seize professor kllikers meaninghere but he appears to suggest that the observation of the generalorder and harmony which pervade inorganic nature would lead us toanticipate a similar order and harmony in the organic world</s>  and this isno doubt true but it by no means follows that the particular order andharmony observed among them should be that which we see</s>  surely thestripes of dun horses and the teeth of the foetal balna are notexplained by the existence of general laws of nature</s>  mr</s>  darwinendeavours to explain the exact order of organic nature which existsnot the mere fact that there is some order</s> and with regard to the existence of a natural system of minerals theobvious reply is that there may be a natural classification of anyobjectsof stones on a seabeach or of works of art a naturalclassification being simply an assemblage of objects in groups so as toexpress their most important and fundamental resemblances anddifferences</s>  no doubt mr</s>  darwin believes that those resemblances anddifferences upon which our natural systems or classifications of animalsand plants are based are resemblances and differences which have beenproduced genetically but we can discover no reason for supposing thathe denies the existence of natural classifications of other kinds</s> and after all is it quite so certain that a genetic relation may notunderlie the classification of minerals</s>  the inorganic world has notalways been what we see it</s>  it has certainly had its metamorphoses andvery probably a long entwickelungsgeschichte out of a nebularblastema</s>  who knows how far that amount of likeness among sets ofminerals in virtue of which they are now grouped into families andorders may not be the expression of the common conditions to which thatparticular patch of nebulous fog which may have been constituted bytheir atoms and of which they may be in the strictest sense thedescendants was subjected</s> it will be obvious from what has preceded that we do not agree withprofessor klliker in thinking the objections which he brings forwardso weighty as to be fatal to darwins view</s>  but even if the case wereotherwise we should be unable to accept the theory of heterogeneousgeneration which is offered as a substitute</s>  that theory is thusstated  the fundamental conception of this hypothesis is that under the  influence of a general law of development the germs of organisms  produce others different from themselves</s>  this might happen 1 by  the fecundated ova passing in the course of their development  under particular circumstances into higher forms 2 by the  primitive and later organisms producing other organisms without  fecundation out of germs or eggs parthenogenesis</s> in favour of this hypothesis professor klliker adduces the wellknownfacts of agamogenesis or alternate generation the extremedissimilarity of the males and females of many animals and of themales females and neuters of those insects which live in colonies andhe defines its relations to the darwinian theory as follows  it is obvious that my hypothesis is apparently very similar to  darwins inasmuch as i also consider that the various forms of  animals have proceeded directly from one another</s>  my hypothesis of  the creation of organisms by heterogeneous generation however is  distinguished very essentially from darwins by the entire absence  of the principle of useful variations and their natural selection  and my fundamental conception is this that a great plan of  development lies at the foundation of the origin of the whole  organic world impelling the simpler forms to more and more complex  developments</s>  how this law operates what influences determine the  development of the eggs and germs and impel them to assume  constantly new forms i naturally cannot pretend to say but i can  at least adduce the great analogy of the alternation of  generations</s>  if a bipinnaria a brachialaria a pluteus is  competent to produce the echinoderm which is so widely different  from it if a hydroid polype can produce the higher medusa if the  vermiform trematode nurse can develop within itself the very  unlike cercaria it will not appear impossible that the egg or  ciliated embryo of a sponge for once under special conditions  might become a hydroid polype or the embryo of a medusa an  echinoderm</s> it is obvious from these extracts that professor kllikers hypothesisis based upon the supposed existence of a close analogy between thephnomena of agamogenesis and the production of new species frompreexisting ones</s>  but is the analogy a real one</s>  we think that it isnot and by the hypothesis cannot be</s> for what are the phnomena of agamogenesis stated generally</s>  animpregnated egg develops into an asexual form a this gives riseasexually to a second form or forms b more or less different from a</s> b may multiply asexually again in the simpler cases however it doesnot but acquiring sexual characters produces impregnated eggs fromwhence a once more arises</s> no case of agamogenesis is known in which when a differs widely fromb it is itself capable of sexual propagation</s>  no case whatever isknown in which the progeny of b by sexual generation is other than areproduction of a</s> but if this be a true statement of the nature of the process ofagamogenesis how can it enable us to comprehend the production of newspecies from already existing ones</s>  let us suppose hynas to havepreceded dogs and to have produced the latter in this way</s>  then thehyna will represent a and the dog b</s>  the first difficulty thatpresents itself is that the hyna must be asexual or the process willbe wholly without analogy in the world of agamogenesis</s>  but passing overthis difficulty and supposing a male and female dog to be produced atthe same time from the hyna stock the progeny of the pair if theanalogy of the simpler kinds of agamogenesis67 is to be followedshould be a litter not of puppies but of young hynas</s>  for theagamogenetic series is always as we have seen a b a b c</s> whereas for the production of a new species the series must be a bb b c</s>  the production of new species or genera is the extremepermanent divergence from the primitive stock</s>  all known agamogeneticprocesses on the other hand end in a complete return to the primitivestock</s>  how then is the production of new species to be renderedintelligible by the analogy of agamogenesis</s> the other alternative put by professor kllikerthe passage offecundated ova in the course of their development into higherformswould if it occurred be merely an extreme case of variation inthe darwinian sense greater in degree than but perfectly similar inkind to that which occurred when the wellknown ancon ram was developedfrom an ordinary ewes ovum</s>  indeed we have always thought that mr</s> darwin has unnecessarily hampered himself by adhering so strictly to hisfavourite natura non facit saltum</s>  we greatly suspect that she doesmake considerable jumps in the way of variation now and then and thatthese saltations give rise to some of the gaps which appear to exist inthe series of known forms</s> strongly and freely as we have ventured to disagree with professorklliker we have always done so with regret and we trust withoutviolating that respect which is due not only to his scientific eminenceand to the careful study which he has devoted to the subject but to theperfect fairness of his argumentation and the generous appreciation ofthe worth of mr</s>  darwins labours

other sort whichis born of flippancy and ignorance and whose aim is only to perpetuateitself as an excuse for idleness and indifference</s>  but it is impossibleto define what is meant by scientific doubt better than in descartesown words</s>  after describing the gradual progress of his negativecriticism he tells us  for all that i did not imitate the sceptics who doubt only for  doubtings sake and pretend to be always undecided on the  contrary my whole intention was to arrive at certainty and to dig  away the drift and the sand until i reached the rock or the clay  beneath</s> and further since no man of common sense when he pulls down his housefor the purpose of rebuilding it fails to provide himself with someshelter while the work is in progress so before demolishing thespacious if not commodious mansion of his old beliefs descartesthought it wise to equip himself with what he calls une morale parprovision by which he resolved to govern his practical life untilsuch time as he should be better instructed</s>  the laws of thisprovisional selfgovernment are embodied in four maxims of which onebinds our philosopher to submit himself to the laws and religion inwhich he was brought up another to act on all those occasions whichcall for action promptly and according to the best of his judgment andto abide without repining by the result a third rule is to seekhappiness in limiting his desires rather than in attempting to satisfythem while the last is to make the search after truth the business ofhis life</s> thus prepared to go on living while he doubted descartes proceeded toface his doubts like a man</s>  one thing was clear to him he would not lieto himselfwould under no penalties say i am sure of that of whichhe was not sure but would go on digging and delving until he came tothe solid adamant or at worst made sure there was no adamant</s>  as therecord of his progress tells us he was obliged to confess that life isfull of delusions that authority may err that testimony may be falseor mistaken that reason lands us in endless fallacies that memory isoften as little trustworthy as hope that the evidence of the verysenses may be misunderstood that dreams are real as long as they lastand that what we call reality may be a long and restless dream</s>  nay itis conceivable that some powerful and malicious being may find hispleasure in deluding us and in making us believe the thing which isnot every moment of our lives</s>  what then is certain</s>  what even ifsuch a being exists is beyond the reach of his powers of delusion</s>  whythe fact that the thought the present consciousness exists</s>  ourthoughts may be delusive but they cannot be fictitious</s>  as thoughtsthey are real and existent and the cleverest deceiver cannot make themotherwise</s> thus thought is existence</s>  more than that so far as we are concernedexistence is thought all our conceptions of existence being some kindor other of thought</s>  do not for a moment suppose that these are mereparadoxes or subtleties</s>  a little reflection upon the commonest factsproves them to be irrefragable truths</s>  for example i take up a marbleand i find it to be a red round hard single body</s>  we call theredness the roundness the hardness and the singleness qualities ofthe marble and it sounds at first the height of absurdity to say thatall these qualities are modes of our own consciousness which cannoteven be conceived to exist in the marble</s>  but consider the redness tobegin with</s>  how does the sensation of redness arise</s>  the waves of acertain very attenuated matter the particles of which are vibratingwith vast rapidity but with very different velocities strike upon themarble and those which vibrate with one particular velocity are thrownoff from its surface in all directions</s>  the optical apparatus of the eyegathers some of these together and gives them such a course that theyimpinge upon the surface of the retina which is a singularly delicateapparatus connected with the termination of the fibres of the opticnerve</s>  the impulses of the attenuated matter or ether affect thisapparatus and the fibres of the optic nerve in a certain way and thechange in the fibres of the optic nerve produces yet other changes inthe brain and these in some fashion unknown to us give rise to thefeeling or consciousness of redness</s>  if the marble could remainunchanged and either the rate of vibration of the ether or the natureof the retina could be altered the marble would seem not red but someother colour</s>  there are many people who are what are called colourblindbeing unable to distinguish one colour from another</s>  such an one mightdeclare our marble to be green and he would be quite as right in sayingthat it is green as we are in declaring it to be red</s>  but then as themarble cannot in itself be both green and red at the same time thisshows that the quality redness must be in our consciousness and not inthe marble</s> in like manner it is easy to see that the roundness and the hardnessare forms of our consciousness belonging to the groups which we callsensations of sight and touch</s>  if the surface of the cornea werecylindrical we should have a very different notion of a round body fromthat which we possess now and if the strength of the fabric and theforce of the muscles of the body were increased a hundredfold ourmarble would seem to be as soft as a pellet of bread crumbs</s> not only is it obvious that all these qualities are in us but if youwill make the attempt you will find it quite impossible to conceive ofblueness roundness and hardness as existing without reference tosome such consciousness as our own</s>  it may seem strange to say that eventhe singleness of the marble is relative to us but extremely simpleexperiments will show that such is veritably the case and that our twomost trustworthy senses may be made to contradict one another on thisvery point</s>  hold the marble between the finger and thumb and look at itin the ordinary way</s>  sight and touch agree that it is single</s>  nowsquint and sight tells you that there are two marbles while touchasserts that there is only one</s>  next return the eyes to their naturalposition and having crossed the forefinger and the middle finger putthe marble between their tips</s>  then touch will declare that there aretwo marbles while sight says that there is only one and touch claimsour belief when we attend to it just as imperatively as sight does</s> but it may be said the marble takes up a certain space which could notbe occupied at the same time by anything else</s>  in other words themarble has the primary quality of matter extension</s>  surely this qualitymust be in the thing and not in our minds</s>  but the reply must still bewhatever may or may not exist in the thing all that we can know ofthese qualities is a state of consciousness</s>  what we call extension is aconsciousness of a relation between two or more affections of thesense of sight or of touch</s>  and it is wholly inconceivable that whatwe call extension should exist independently of such consciousness asour own</s>  whether notwithstanding this inconceivability it does soexist or not is a point on which i offer no opinion</s> thus whatever our marble may be in itself all that we can know of itis under the shape of a bundle of our own consciousnesses</s> nor is our knowledge of anything we know or feel more or less than aknowledge of states of consciousness</s>  and our whole life is made up ofsuch states</s>  some of these states we refer to a cause we call selfothers to a cause or causes which may be comprehended under the title ofnotself</s>  but neither of the existence of self nor of that ofnotself have we or can we by any possibility have any suchunquestionable and immediate certainty as we have of the states ofconsciousness which we consider to be their effects</s>  they are notimmediately observed facts but results of the application of the law ofcausation to those facts</s>  strictly speaking the existence of a selfand of a notself are hypotheses by which we account for the facts ofconsciousness</s>  they stand upon the same footing as the belief in thegeneral trustworthiness of memory and in the general constancy of theorder of natureas hypothetical assumptions which cannot be proved orknown with that highest degree of certainty which is given by immediateconsciousness but which nevertheless are of the highest practicalvalue inasmuch as the conclusions logically drawn from them are alwaysverified by experience</s> this in my judgment is the ultimate issue of descartes argument butit is proper for me to point out that we have left descartes himselfsome way behind us</s>  he stopped at the famous formula i thinktherefore i am</s>  but a little consideration will show this formula to befull of snares and verbal entanglements</s>  in the first place thetherefore has no business there</s>  the i am is assumed in the ithink which is simply another way of saying i am thinking</s>  and inthe second place i think is not one simple proposition but threedistinct assertions rolled into one</s>  the first of these is somethingcalled i exists the second is something called thought exists andthe third is the thought is the result of the action of the i</s> now it will be obvious to you that the only one of these threepropositions which can stand the cartesian test of certainty is thesecond</s>  it cannot be doubted for the very doubt is an existent thought</s> but the first and third whether true or not may be doubted and havebeen doubted</s>  for the assertor may be asked how do you know thatthought is not selfexistent or that a given thought is not the effectof its antecedent thought or of some external power</s>  and a diversity ofother questions much more easily put than answered</s>  descartesdetermined as he was to strip off all the garments which the intellectweaves for itself forgot this gossamer shirt of the self to thegreat detriment and indeed ruin of his toilet when he began to clothehimself again</s> but it is beside my purpose to dwell upon the minor peculiarities of thecartesian philosophy</s>  all i wish to put clearly before your minds thusfar is that descartes having commenced by declaring doubt to be aduty found certainty in consciousness alone and that the necessaryoutcome of his views is what may properly be termed idealism namelythe doctrine that whatever the universe may be all we can know of itis the picture presented to us by consciousness</s>  this picture may be atrue likenessthough how this can be is inconceivable or it may haveno more resemblance to its cause than one of bachs fugues has to theperson who is playing it or than a piece of poetry has to the mouth andlips of a reciter</s>  it is enough for all the practical purposes of humanexistence if we find that our trust in the representations ofconsciousness is verified by results and that by their help we areenabled to walk surefootedly in this life</s> thus the method or path which leads to truth indicated by descartestakes us straight to the critical idealism of his great successor kant</s> it is that idealism which declares the ultimate fact of all knowledge tobe a consciousness or in other words a mental phenomenon andtherefore affirms the highest of all certainties and indeed the onlyabsolute certainty to be the existence of mind</s>  but it is also thatidealism which refuses to make any assertions either positive ornegative as to what lies beyond consciousness</s>  it accuses the subtleberkeley of stepping beyond the limits of knowledge when he declaredthat a substance of matter does not exist and of illogicality for notseeing that the arguments which he supposed demolished the existence ofmatter were equally destructive to the existence of soul</s>  and it refusesto listen to the jargon of more recent days about the absolute andall the other hypostatized adjectives the initial letters of the namesof which are generally printed in capital letters just as you give agrenadier a bearskin cap to make him look more formidable than he is bynature</s> i repeat the path indicated and followed by descartes which we havehitherto been treading leads through doubt to that critical idealismwhich lies at the heart of modern metaphysical thought</s>  but thediscourse shows us another and apparently very different path whichleads quite as definitely to that correlation of all the phnomena ofthe universe with matter and motion which lies at the heart of modernphysical thought and which most people call materialism</s> the early part of the seventeenth century when descartes reachedmanhood is one of the great epochs of the intellectual life of mankind</s> at that time physical science suddenly strode into the arena of publicand familiar thought and openly challenged not only philosophy and thechurch but that common ignorance which passes by the name of commonsense</s>  the assertion of the motion of the earth was a defiance to allthree and physical science threw down her glove by the hand of galileo</s> it is not pleasant to think of the immediate result of the combat tosee the champion of science old worn and on his knees before thecardinal inquisitor signing his name to what he knew to be a lie</s>  andno doubt the cardinals rubbed their hands as they thought how well theyhad silenced and discredited their adversary</s>  but two hundred years havepassed and however feeble or faulty her soldiers physical science sitscrowned and enthroned as one of the legitimate rulers of the world ofthought</s>  charity children would be ashamed not to know that the earthmoves while the schoolmen are forgotten and the cardinalswell thecardinals are at the oecumenical council still at their old businessof trying to stop the movement of the world</s> as a ship which having lain becalmed with every stitch of canvas setbounds away before the breeze which springs up astern so the mind ofdescartes poised in equilibrium of doubt not only yielded to the fullforce of the impulse towards physical science and physical ways ofthought given by his great contemporaries galileo and harvey but shotbeyond them and anticipated by bold speculation the conclusionswhich could only be placed upon a secure foundation by the labours ofgenerations of workers</s> descartes saw that the discoveries of galileo meant that the remotestparts of the universe were governed by mechanical laws while those ofharvey meant that the same laws presided over the operations of thatportion of the world which is nearest to us namely our own bodilyframe</s>  and crossing the interval between the centre and its vastcircumference by one of the great strides of genius descartes sought toresolve all the phnomena of the universe into matter and motion orforces operating according to law</s> 71 this grand conception which issketched in the discours and more fully developed in the principesand in the trait de lhomme he worked out with extraordinary powerand knowledge and with the effect of arriving in the lastnamed essayat that purely mechanical view of vital phnomena towards which modernphysiology is striving</s> let us try to understand how descartes got into this path and why itled him where it did</s>  the mechanism of the circulation of the blood hadevidently taken a great hold of his mind as he describes it severaltimes at much length</s>  after giving a full account of it in thediscourse and erroneously describing the motion of the blood not tothe contraction of the walls of the heart but to the heat which hesupposes to be generated there he adds  this motion which i have just explained is as much the necessary  result of the structure of the parts which one can see in the  heart and of the heat which one may feel there with ones fingers  and of the nature of the blood which may be experimentally  ascertained as is that of a clock of the force the situation and  the figure of its weight and of its wheels</s> but if this apparently vital operation were explicable as a simplemechanism might not other vital operations be reducible to the samecategory</s>  descartes replies without hesitation in the affirmative</s>   the animal spirits says he resemble a very subtle fluid or a  very pure and vivid flame and are continually generated in the  heart and ascend to the brain as to a sort of reservoir</s>  hence  they pass into the nerves and are distributed to the muscles  causing contraction or relaxation according to their quantity</s> thus according to descartes the animal body is an automaton which iscompetent to perform all the animal functions in exactly the same way asa clock or any other piece of mechanism</s>  as he puts the case himself  in proportion as these spirits the animal spirits enter the  cavities of the brain they pass thence into the pores of its  substance and from these pores into the nerves where according  as they enter or even only tend to enter more or less into one  than into another they have the power of altering the figure of  the muscles into which the nerves are inserted and by this means  of causing all the limbs to move</s>  thus as you may have seen in the  grottoes and the fountains in royal gardens the force with which  the water issues from its reservoir is sufficient to move various  machines and even to make them play instruments or pronounce  words according to the different disposition of the pipes which  lead the water</s>   and in truth the nerves of the machine which i am describing may  very well be compared to the pipes of these waterworks its muscles  and its tendons to the other various engines and springs which seem  to move them its animal spirits to the water which impels them of  which the heart is the fountain while the cavities of the brain  are the central office</s>  moreover respiration and other such  actions as are natural and usual in the body and which depend on  the course of the spirits are like the movements of a clock or of  a mill which may be kept up by the ordinary flow of the water</s>   the external objects which by their mere presence act upon the  organs of the senses and which by this means determine the  corporal machine to move in many different ways according as the  parts of the brain are arranged are like the strangers who  entering into some of the grottoes of these waterworks  unconsciously cause the movements which take place in their  presence</s>  for they cannot enter without treading upon certain  planks so arranged that for example if they approach a bathing  diana they cause her to hide among the reeds and if they attempt  to follow her they see approaching a neptune who threatens them  with his trident or if they try some other way they cause some  monster who vomits water into their faces to dart out or like  contrivances according to the fancy of the engineers who have made  them</s>  and lastly when the rational soul is lodged in this  machine it will have its principal seat in the brain and will  take the place of the engineer who ought to be in that part of the  works with which all the pipes are connected when he wishes to  increase or to slacken or in some way to alter their  movements</s> 72and again still more strongly  all the functions which i have attributed to this machine the  body as the digestion of food the pulsation of the heart and of  the arteries the nutrition and the growth of the limbs  respiration wakefulness and sleep the reception of light  sounds odours flavours heat and such like qualities in the  organs of the external senses the impression of the ideas of these  in the organ of common sense and in the imagination the retention  or the impression of these ideas on the memory the internal  movements of the appetites and the passions and lastly the  external movements of all the limbs which follow so aptly as well  the action of the objects which are presented to the senses as the  impressions which meet in the memory that they imitate as nearly  as possible those of a real man73 i desire i say that you  should consider that these functions in the machine naturally  proceed from the mere arrangement of its organs neither more nor  less than do the movements of a clock or other automaton from  that of its weights and its wheels so that so far as these are  concerned it is not necessary to conceive any other vegetative or  sensitive soul nor any other principle of motion or of life than  the blood and the spirits agitated by the fire which burns  continually in the heart and which is no wise essentially  different from all the fires which exist in inanimate bodies</s> 74the spirit of these passages is exactly that of the most advancedphysiology of the present day all that is necessary to make themcoincide with our present physiology in form is to represent thedetails of the working of the animal machinery in modern language andby the aid of modern conceptions</s> most undoubtedly the digestion of food in the human body is a purelychemical process and the passage of the nutritive parts of that foodinto the blood a physical operation</s>  beyond all question thecirculation of the blood is simply a matter of mechanism and resultsfrom the structure and arrangement of the parts of the heart andvessels from the contractility of those organs and from theregulation of that contractility by an automatically acting nervousapparatus</s>  the progress of physiology has further shown that thecontractility of the muscles and the irritability of the nerves arepurely the results of the molecular mechanism of those organs and thatthe regular movements of the respiratory alimentary and other internalorgans are governed and guided as mechanically by their appropriatenervous centres</s>  the even rhythm of the breathing of every one of usdepends upon the structural integrity of a particular region of themedulla oblongata as much as the ticking of a clock depends upon theintegrity of the escapement</s>  you may take away the hands of a clock andbreak up its striking machinery but it will still tick and a man maybe unable to feel speak or move and yet he will breathe</s> again in entire accordance with descartes affirmation it is certainthat the modes of motion which constitute the physical basis of lightsound and heat are transmuted into affections of nervous matter by thesensory organs</s>  these affections are so to speak a kind of physicalideas which are retained in the central organs constituting what mightbe called physical memory and may be combined in a manner which answersto association and imagination or may give rise to muscularcontractions in those reflex actions which are the mechanicalrepresentatives of volitions</s> consider what happens when a blow is aimed at the eye</s> 75 instantlyand without our knowledge or will and even against the will theeyelids close</s>  what is it that happens</s>  a picture of the rapidlyadvancing fist is made upon the retina at the back of the eye</s>  theretina changes this picture into an affection of a number of the fibresof the optic nerve the fibres of the optic nerve affect certain partsof the brain the brain in consequence affects those particular fibresof the seventh nerve which go to the orbicular muscle of the eyelidsthe change in these nervefibres causes the muscular fibres to changetheir dimensions so as to become shorter and broader and the result isthe closing of the slit between the two lids round which these fibresare disposed</s>  here is a pure mechanism giving rise to a purposiveaction and strictly comparable to that by which descartes supposes hiswaterwork diana to be moved</s>  but we may go further and inquire whetherour volition in what we term voluntary action ever plays any otherpart than that of descartes engineer sitting in his office andturning this tap or the other as he wishes to set one or anothermachine in motion but exercising no direct influence upon the movementsof the whole</s> our voluntary acts consist of two parts firstly we desire to perform acertain action and secondly we somehow set agoing a machinery whichdoes what we desire</s>  but so little do we directly influence thatmachinery that ninetenths of us do not even know its existence</s> suppose one wills to raise ones arm and whirl it round</s>  nothing iseasier</s>  but the majority of us do not know that nerves and muscles areconcerned in this process and the best anatomist among us would beamazingly perplexed if he were called upon to direct the successionand the relative strength of the multitudinous nervechanges which arethe actual causes of this very simple operation</s> so again in speaking</s>  how many of us know that the voice is produced inthe larynx and modified by the mouth</s>  how many among these instructedpersons understand how the voice is produced and modified</s>  and whatliving man if he had unlimited control over all the nerves supplyingthe mouth and larynx of another person could make him pronounce asentence</s>  yet if one has anything to say what is easier than to sayit</s>  we desire the utterance of certain words we touch the spring of thewordmachine and they are spoken</s>  just as descartes engineer when hewanted a particular hydraulic machine to play had only to turn a tapand what he wished was done</s>  it is because the body is a machine thateducation is possible</s>  education is the formation of habits asuperinducing of an artificial organization upon the naturalorganization of the body so that acts which at first required aconscious effort eventually became unconscious and mechanical</s>  if theact which primarily requires a distinct consciousness and volition ofits details always needed the same effort education would be animpossibility</s> according to descartes then all the functions which are common to manand animals are performed by the body as a mere mechanism and he looksupon consciousness as the peculiar distinction of the chosepensante of the rational soul which in man and in man only indescartes opinion is superadded to the body</s>  this rational soul heconceived to be lodged in the pineal gland as in a sort of centraloffice and here by the intermediation of the animal spirits itbecame aware of what was going on in the body or influenced theoperations of the body</s>  modern physiologists do not ascribe so exalteda function to the little pineal gland but in a vague sort of way theyadopt descartes principle and suppose that the soul is lodged in thecortical part of the brainat least this is commonly regarded as theseat and instrument of consciousness</s> descartes has clearly stated what he conceived to be the differencebetween spirit and matter</s>  matter is substance which has extension butdoes not think spirit is substance which thinks but has no extension</s> it is very hard to form a definite notion of what this phraseologymeans when it is taken in connexion with the location of the soul inthe pineal gland and i can only represent it to myself as signifyingthat the soul is a mathematical point having place but not extensionwithin the limits of the pineal gland</s>  not only has it place but itmust exert force for according to the hypothesis it is competentwhen it wills to change the course of the animal spirits which consistof matter in motion</s>  thus the soul becomes a centre of force</s>  but atthe same time the distinction between spirit and matter vanishesinasmuch as matter according to a tenable hypothesis may be nothingbut a multitude of centres of force</s>  the case is worse if we adopt themodern vague notion that consciousness is seated in the grey matter ofthe cerebrum generally for as the grey matter has extension thatwhich is lodged in it must also have extension</s>  and thus we are led inanother way to lose spirit in matter</s> in truth descartes physiology like the modern physiology of which itanticipates the spirit leads straight to materialism so far as thattitle is rightly applicable to the doctrine that we have no knowledgeof any thinking substance apart from extended substance and thatthought is as much a function of matter as motion is</s>  thus we arrive atthe singular result that of the two paths opened up to us in thediscourse upon method the one leads by way of berkeley and hume tokant and idealism while the other leads by way of de la mettrie andpriestley to modern physiology and materialism</s> 76 our stem dividesinto two main branches which grow in opposite ways and bear flowerswhich look as different as they can well be</s>  but each branch is soundand healthy and has as much life and vigour as the other</s> if a botanist found this state of things in a new plant i imagine thathe might be inclined to think that his tree was monoeciousthat theflowers were of different sexes and that so far from setting up abarrier between the two branches of the tree the only hope of fertilitylay in bringing them together</s>  i may be taking too much of anaturalists view of the case but i must confess that this is exactlymy notion of what is to be done with metaphysics and physics</s>  theirdifferences are complementary not antagonistic and thought will neverbe completely fruitful until the one unites with the other</s>  let me tryto explain what i mean</s>  i hold with the materialist that the humanbody like all living bodies is a machine all the operations of whichwill sooner or later be explained on physical principles</s>  i believethat we shall sooner or later arrive at a mechanical equivalent ofconsciousness just as we have arrived at a mechanical equivalent ofheat</s>  if a pound weight falling through a distance of a foot gives riseto a definite amount of heat which may properly be said to be itsequivalent the same pound weight falling through a foot on a mans handgives rise to a definite amount of feeling which might with equalpropriety be said to be its equivalent in consciousness</s> 77 and as wealready know that there is a certain parity between the intensity of apain and the strength of ones desire to get rid of that pain andsecondly that there is a certain correspondence between the intensityof the heat or mechanical violence which gives rise to the pain andthe pain itself the possibility of the establishment of a correlationbetween mechanical force and volition becomes apparent</s>  and the sameconclusion is suggested by the fact that within certain limits theintensity of the mechanical force we exert is proportioned to theintensity of our desire to exert it</s> thus i am prepared to go with the materialists wherever the true pursuitof the path of descartes may lead them and i am glad on all occasionsto declare my belief that their fearless development of thematerialistic aspect of these matters has had an immense and a mostbeneficial influence upon physiology and psychology</s>  nay more whenthey go farther than i think they are entitled to dowhen theyintroduce calvinism into science and declare that man is nothing but amachine i do not see any particular harm in their doctrines so long asthey admit that which is a matter of experimental factnamely that itis a machine capable of adjusting itself within certain limits</s> i protest that if some great power would agree to make me always thinkwhat is true and do what is right on condition of being turned into asort of clock and wound up every morning before i got out of bed ishould instantly close with the offer</s>  the only freedom i care about isthe freedom to do right the freedom to do wrong i am ready to part withon the cheapest terms to any one who will take it of me</s>  but when thematerialists stray beyond the borders of their path and begin to talkabout there being nothing else in the universe but matter and force andnecessary laws and all the rest of their grenadiers i decline tofollow them</s>  i go back to the point from which we started and to theother path of descartes</s>  i remind you that we have already seen clearlyand distinctly and in a manner which admits of no doubt that all ourknowledge is a knowledge of states of consciousness</s>  matter andforce are so far as we can know mere names for certain forms ofconsciousness</s>  necessary means that of which we cannot conceive thecontrary</s>  law means a rule which we have always found to hold goodand which we expect always will hold good</s>  thus it is an indisputabletruth that what we call the material world is only known to us under theforms of the ideal world and as descartes tells us our knowledge ofthe soul is more intimate and certain than our knowledge of the body</s> if i say that impenetrability is a property of matter all that i canreally mean is that the consciousness i call extension and theconsciousness i call resistance constantly accompany one another</s>  whyand how they are thus related is a mystery</s>  and if i say that thought isa property of matter all that i can mean is that actually or possiblythe consciousness of extension and that of resistance accompany allother sorts of consciousness</s>  but as in the former case why they arethus associated is an insoluble mystery</s> from all this it follows that what i may term legitimate materialismthat is the extension of the conceptions and of the methods of physicalscience to the highest as well as the lowest phenomena of vitality isneither more nor less than a sort of shorthand idealism and descartestwo paths meet at the summit of the mountain though they set out onopposite sides of it</s> the reconciliation of physics and metaphysics lies in the acknowledgmentof faults upon both sides in the confession by physics that all thephnomena of nature are in their ultimate analysis known to us only asfacts of consciousness in the admission by metaphysics that the factsof consciousness are practically interpretable only by the methods andthe formul of physics and finally in the observance by bothmetaphysical and physical thinkers of descartes maximassent to noproposition the matter of which is not so clear and distinct that itcannot be doubted</s> when you did me the honour to ask me to deliver this address i confessi was perplexed what topic to select</s>  for you are emphatically anddistinctly a christian body while science and philosophy within therange of which lie all the topics on which i could venture to speak areneither christian nor unchristian but are extrachristian and have aworld of their own which to use language which will be very familiarto your ears just now is not only unsectarian but is altogethersecular</s>  the arguments which i have put before you tonight forexample are not inconsistent so far as i know with any form oftheology</s> after much consideration i thought that i might be most useful to youif i attempted to give you some vision of this extrachristian world asit appears to a person who lives a good deal in it and if i tried toshow you by what methods the dwellers therein try to distinguish truthfrom falsehood in regard to some of the deepest and most difficultproblems that beset humanity in order to be clear about their actionsand to walk surefootedly in this life as descartes says</s> it struck me that if the execution of my project came anywhere near theconception of it you would become aware that the philosophers and themen of science are not exactly what they are sometimes represented toyou to be and that their methods and paths do not lead soperpendicularly downwards as you are occasionally told they do</s>  and imust admit also that a particular and personal motive weighed withmenamely the desire to show that a certain discourse which broughta great storm about my head some time ago contained nothing but theultimate development of the views of the father of modern philosophy</s>  ido not know if i have been quite wise in allowing this last motive toweigh with me</s>  they say that the most dangerous thing one can do in athunderstorm is to shelter oneself under a great tree and the historyof descartes life shows how narrowly he escaped being riven by thelightnings which were more destructive in his time than in ours</s> descartes lived and died a good catholic and prided himself upon havingdemonstrated the existence of god and of the soul of man</s>  as a rewardfor his exertions his old friends the jesuits put his works upon theindex and called him an atheist while the protestant divines ofholland declared him to be both a jesuit and an atheist</s>  his booksnarrowly escaped being burned by the hangman the fate of vanini wasdangled before his eyes and the misfortunes of galileo so alarmed himthat he wellnigh renounced the pursuits by which the world has sogreatly benefited and was driven into subterfuges and evasions whichwere not worthy of him</s> very cowardly you may say and so it was</s>  but you must make allowancefor the fact that in the seventeenth century not only did heresy meanpossible burning or imprisonment but the very suspicion of itdestroyed a mans peace and rendered the calm pursuit of truthdifficult or impossible</s>  i fancy that descartes was a man to care moreabout being worried and disturbed than about being burned outrightand like many other men sacrificed for the sake of peace andquietness what he would have stubbornly maintained against downrightviolence</s> however this may be let those who are sure they would have done betterthrow stones at him</s>  i have no feelings but those of gratitude andreverence for the man who did what he did when he did and a sort ofshame that any one should repine against taking a fair share of suchtreatment as the world thought good enough for him</s> finally it occurs to me that such being my feeling about the matterit may be useful to all of us if i ask you what is yours</s>  do you thinkthat the christianity of the seventeenth century looks nobler and moreattractive for such treatment of such a man</s>  you will hardly reply thatit does</s>  but if it does not may it not be well if all of you do whatlies within your power to prevent the christianity of the nineteenthcentury from repeating the scandal</s> there are one or two living men who a couple of centuries hence willbe remembered as descartes is now because they have produced greatthoughts which will live and grow as long as mankind lasts</s> if the twentyfirst century studies their history
