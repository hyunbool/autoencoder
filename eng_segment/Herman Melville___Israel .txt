hiding in a farmers granary israel saw a man witha lantern approaching</s>  he was about to flee when the man hailed him ina wellknown voice bidding him have no fear</s>  it was the farmer himself</s> he carried a message to israel from a gentleman of brentford to theeffect that the refugee was earnestly requested to repair on thefollowing evening to that gentlemans mansion</s> at first israel was disposed to surmise that either the farmer wasplaying him false or else his honest credulity had been imposed upon byevilminded persons</s>  at any rate he regarded the message as a decoyand for half an hour refused to credit its sincerity</s>  but at length hewas induced to think a little better of it</s>  the gentleman giving theinvitation was one squire woodcock of brentford whose loyalty to theking had been under suspicion so at least the farmer averred</s>  thislatter information was not without its effect</s> at nightfall on the following day being disguised in strange clothes bythe farmer israel stole from his retreat and after a few hours walkarrived before the ancient brick house of the squire who opening thedoor in person and learning who it was that stood there at

what you have said</s>  tell me nowwhat i am to do</s> oh there is just nothing to be done tonight said the squire norfor some days to come perhaps but we wanted to have you prepared</s> and hereupon he hinted to his guest rather vaguely of his generalintention and that over begged him to entertain them with some accountof his adventures since he first took up arms for his country</s>  to thisisrael had no objections in the world since all men love to tell thetale of hardships endured in a righteous cause</s>  but ere beginning hisstory the squire refreshed him with some cold beef laid in a snowynapkin and a glass of perry and thrice during the narration of theadventures pressed him with additional draughts</s> but after his second glass israel declined to drink more mild as thebeverage was</s>  for he noticed that not only did the three gentlemenlisten with the utmost interest to his story but likewiseinterrupted him with questions and crossquestions in the mostpertinacious manner</s>  so this led him to be on his guard not beingabsolutely certain yet as to who they might really be or what wastheir real design</s>  but as it turned out squire woodcock and his friendsonly sought to satisfy themselves thoroughly before making their finaldisclosures that the exile was one in whom implicit confidence might beplaced</s> and to this desirable conclusion they eventually came for upon theending of israels story after expressing their sympathies for hishardships and applauding his generous patriotism in so patientlyenduring adversity as well as singing

he burrowed ninety feetbeneath the clover</s>  in the blind tomb of the midnight he stretched histwo arms sideways and felt as if coffined at not being able to extendthem straight out on opposite

of his eyesburst with impotent distension</s>  then he thought the air itself wasgetting unbearable</s>  he stood up at the griffin slits pressing his lipsfar into them till he moulded his lips there to suck the utmost of theopen air possible</s> and continually to heighten his frenzy there recurred to him again andagain what the squire had told him as to the origin of the cell</s>  itseemed that this part of the old house or rather this wall of it wasextremely ancient dating far beyond the era of elizabeth having onceformed portion of a religious retreat belonging to the templars</s>  thedomestic discipline of this order was rigid and merciless in theextreme</s>  in a side wall of their second storey chapel horizontal and ona level with the floor they had an internal vacancy left

girth of ones wristsunk like a telescope three feet through the masonry into the cellserved at once for ventilation and to push through food to theprisoner</s>  this hole opening into the chapel also enabled the poorsolitaire as intended to overhear the religious services at the altarand without being present take part in the same</s>  it was deemed a goodsign of the state of the sufferers soul if from the gloomy recesses ofthe wall was heard the agonized groan of his dismal response</s>  this wasregarded in the light of a penitent wail from the dead because thecustoms of the order ordained

of his household that he was about toleave behind him a prisoner in the wall this seemed evident from thecircumstance that thus far no soul had visited that prisoner</s>  it couldnot be otherwise</s>  doubtless the squire having no opportunity toconverse in private with his relatives or friends at the moment of hissudden arrest had been forced to keep his secret for the present forfear of involving israel in still worse calamities</s>  but would he leavehim to perish piecemeal in the wall</s>  all surmise was baffled in theunconjecturable possibilities of the case</s>  but some sort of action

heard a step not veryfar off in the passage</s>  it seemed approaching</s>  instantly he flew to thejamb which remained unclosed and disappearing within drew the stoneafter him by the iron knob</s>  owing to his hurried violence the jambclosed with a dull dismal and singular noise</s>  a shriek followed fromwithin the room</s>  in a panic israel fled up the dark stairs and nearthe top in his

hall towards the large staircaseat its opposite end he heard confused hurrying noises from theneighboring rooms and in another instant several persons mostly innightdresses appeared at their chamberdoors thrusting out alarmedfaces lit by a lamp held by one of the number a rather elderly lady inwidows weeds who by her appearance seemed to have just risen from asleepless chair instead of an oblivious couch</s>  israels heart beat likea hammer his face turned like a sheet</s>  but bracing himself pulling hishat lower down over his eyes settling his head in the collar of hiscoat he

the mansion andwithdrawing the chain and bolt stood in the open air</s>  it was a brightmoonlight night</s>  he struck slowly across the open grounds towards thesunken fields beyond</s>  whenmidway across the grounds he turned towardsthe mansion and saw three of the front windows filled with white facesgazing in terror at the wonderful spectre</s>  soon descending a slope hedisappeared from their view</s> presently he came to hilly land in meadow whose grass having beenlately cut now lay dotting the slope in cocks a sinuous line of creamyvapor meandered through the lowlands at the base

of sleep hisreveries would have soon merged into slumbers still wilder dreams hadhe not rallied himself and departed on his way fearful of forgettinghimself in an emergency like the present</s>  it now occurred to him thatwell as his disguise had served him in escaping from the mansion ofsquire woodcock that disguise might fatally endanger him if he shouldbe discovered in it abroad</s>  he might pass for a ghost at night andamong the relations and immediate friends of the gentleman deceased butby day and among indifferent persons he ran no small risk of beingapprehended for an entrythief</s>  he bitterly lamented his omission in notpulling on the squires clothes over his own so that he might now havereappeared in his former guise</s> as meditating over this difficulty he was passing along

of ghastlyblank</s>  it was no living man</s> but mechanically continuing his course israel drew still nearer and sawa scarecrow</s> not a little relieved by the discovery our adventurer paused moreparticularly to survey so deceptive an object which seemed to have beenconstructed on the most efficient principles probably by some brokendown wax figure costumer</s>  it comprised the complete wardrobe of ascarecrow namely a cocked hat bunged tattered coat old velveteenbreeches and long worsted stockings full of holes all stuffed verynicely with straw and skeletoned by a framework of poles</s>  there was agreat flapped pocket to the coatwhich seemed to have been somelaborersstanding invitingly opened</s>  putting his hands in israel drewout the lid of an old tobaccobox the broken bowl of a pipe two rustynails and a few kernels of wheat</s>  this reminded him of the squirespockets</s>  trying them he produced a handsome handkerchief aspectaclecase with a purse containing some silver and gold amountingto a little more than five pounds</s>  such is the difference between thecontents of the pockets of scarecrows and the pockets of welltodosquires</s>  ere donning his present habiliments israel had not omitted towithdraw his own money from his own coat and put it in the pocket ofhis own waistcoat which he had not exchanged</s> looking upon the scarecrow more attentively it struck him thatmiserable as its wardrobe was nevertheless here was a chance forgetting rid of the unsuitable and perilous clothes of the squire</s>  noother available opportunity might present itself for a time</s>  before heencountered any living creature by daylight another suit must somehowbe had</s>  his exchange with the old ditcher after his escape from the innnear portsmouth had familiarized him with the most deplorable ofwardrobes</s>  well too he knew and had experienced it that for a mandesirous of avoiding notice the more wretched the clothes the better</s> for who does not shun the scurvy wretch poverty advancing in batteredhat and lamentable coat</s> without more ado slipping off the squires raiment he donned thescarecrows after carefully shaking out the hay which from manyalternate soakings and bakings in rain and sun had become quite brokenup and would have been almost dust were it not for the mildew whichdamped it</s>  but sufficient of this wretched old hay remained adhesive tothe inside of the breeches and coatsleeves to produce the mostirritating torment</s> the grand moral question now came up what to do with the purse</s>  wouldit be dishonest under the circumstances to appropriate that purse</s> considering the whole matter and not forgetting that he had notreceived from the gentleman deceased the promised reward for hisservices as courier

would have been insane to have returned it to the relations</s> such mysterious honesty would have but resulted in his arrest as arebel or rascal</s>  as for the squires clothes handkerchief andspectaclecase they must be put out of sight with all dispatch</s>  sogoing to a morass not remote israel sunk them deep down and heapedtufts of the rank sod upon them</s>  then returning to the field of cornsat down under the lee of a rock about a hundred yards from where thescarecrow had stood thinking which way he now had best direct hissteps</s>  but his late ramble coming after so long a deprivation of restsoon produced effects not so easy to be shaken off as when reposingupon the haycock</s>  he felt less anxious too since changing his apparel</s> so before he was aware he fell into deep sleep</s> when he awoke the sun was well up in the sky</s>  looking around he saw afarmlaborer with a pitchfork coming at a distance into view whosesteps seemed bent in a direction not far from the spot where he lay</s> immediately it struck our adventurer that this man must be familiar withthe scarecrow perhaps had himself fashioned it</s>  should he miss it thenhe might make immediate search and so discover the thief so imprudentlyloitering upon the very field of his operations</s> waiting until the man momentarily disappeared in a little hollow israelran briskly to the identical spot where the scarecrow had stood wherestanding stiffly erect pulling the hat well over his face andthrusting out his arm pointed steadfastly towards the squires abodehe awaited the event</s>  soon the man reappeared in sight and marchingright on paused not far from israel and gave him an one earnest lookas if it were his daily wont to satisfy that all was right with thescarecrow</s>  no sooner was the man departed to a reasonable distancethan quitting his post israel struck across the fields towards london</s> but he had not yet quite quitted the field when it occurred to him toturn round and see if the man was completely out of sight when to hisconsternation he saw the man returning towards him evidently by hispace and gesture in unmixed amazement</s>  the man must have turned round tolook before israel had done so</s>  frozen to the ground israel knew notwhat to do but next moment it struck him that this very motionlessnesswas the least hazardous plan in such a strait</s>  thrusting out his armagain towards the house once more he stood stock still and againawaited the event</s> it so happened that this time in pointing towards the house israelunavoidably pointed towards the advancing man</s>  hoping that thestrangeness of this coincidence might by operating on the manssuperstition incline him to beat an immediate retreat israel kept coolas he might</s>  but the man proved to be of a braver metal thananticipated</s>  in passing the spot where the scarecrow had stood andperceiving beyond the possibility of mistake that by someunaccountable agency it had suddenly removed itself to a distanceinstead of being terrified at this verification of his worstapprehensions the man pushed on for israel apparently resolved to siftthis mystery to the bottom</s> seeing him now determinately coming with pitchfork valiantly presentedisrael as a last means of practising on the fellows fears of thesupernatural suddenly doubled up both fists presenting them savagelytowards him at a distance of about twenty paces at the same timeshowing his teeth like a skulls and demoniacally rolling his eyes</s>  theman paused bewildered looked all round him looked at the springinggrain then across at some trees then up at the sky and satisfied atlast by those observations that the world at large had not undergone amiracle in the last fifteen minutes resolutely resumed his advance thepitchfork like a boardingpike now aimed full at the breast of theobject</s>  seeing all his stratagems vain israel now threw himself intothe original attitude of the scarecrow and once again stood immovable</s> abating his pace by degrees almost to a mere creep the man at last camewithin three feet of him and pausing gazed amazed into israels eyes</s> with a stern and terrible expression israel resolutely returned theglance but otherwise remained like a statue hoping thus to stare hispursuer out of countenance</s>  at last the man slowly presented one prongof his fork towards israels left eye</s>  nearer and nearer the sharp pointcame till no longer capable of enduring such a test israel took to hisheels with all speed his tattered coattails streaming behind

better wind and bottomthan any</s>
 outstripping the whole pack he finally shot out of their sightin an extensive park heavily timbered in one quarter</s>  he never saw moreof these people</s> loitering in the wood till nightfall he then stole out and made thebest of his way towards the house of that good natured farmer in whosecornloft he had received his first message from squire woodcock</s> rousing this man up a little before
