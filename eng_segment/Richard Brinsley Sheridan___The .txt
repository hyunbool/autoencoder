the rivalsa comedyby richard brinsley sheridan      prefacea preface to a play seems generally to be considered as a kind ofclosetprologue in whichif his piece has been successfulthe authorsolicits that indulgence from the reader which he had beforeexperienced from the audience but as the scope and immediate object ofa play is to please a mixed assembly in representation whosejudgment in the theatre at least is decisive its degree of reputationis usually as determined as public before it can be prepared for thecooler tribunal of the study</s>  thus any farther solicitude on the partof the writer becomes unnecessary at least if not an intrusion and ifthe piece has been condemned in the performance i fear an address tothe closet like an appeal to posterity is constantly regarded as theprocrastination of a suit from a consciousness of the weakness of thecause</s>  from these considerations the following comedy would certainlyhave been submitted to the reader without any farther introductionthan what it had in the representation but that its success hasprobably been founded on a circumstance which the author is informedhas not before attended a theatrical trial and which consequentlyought not to pass unnoticed</s> i need scarcely add that the circumstance alluded to was thewithdrawing of the piece to remove those imperfections in the firstrepresentation which were too obvious to escape reprehension and toonumerous to admit of a hasty correction</s>  there are few writers ibelieve who even in the fullest consciousness of error do not wishto palliate the faults which they acknowledge and however triflingthe performance to second their confession of its deficiencies bywhatever plea seems least disgraceful to their ability</s>  in the presentinstance it cannot be said to amount either to candour or modesty inme to acknowledge an extreme inexperience and want of judgment onmatters in which without guidance from practice or spur fromsuccess a young man should scarcely boast of being an adept</s>  if it besaid that under such disadvantages no one should attempt to write aplay i must beg leave to dissent from the position while the firstpoint of experience that i have gained on the subject is a knowledgeof the candour and judgment with which an impartial publicdistinguishes between the errors of inexperience and incapacity andthe indulgence which it shows even to a disposition to remedy thedefects of either</s> it were unnecessary to enter into any further extenuation of what wasthought exceptionable in this play but that it has been said that themanagers should have prevented some of the defects before itsappearance to the publicand in particular the uncommon length of thepiece as represented the first night</s>  it were an ill return for themost liberal and gentlemanly conduct on their side to suffer anycensure to rest where none was deserved</s>  hurry in writing has long beenexploded as an excuse for an authorhowever in the dramatic lineit may happen that both an author and a manager may wish to fill achasm in the entertainment of the public with a hastiness notaltogether culpable</s>  the season was advanced when i first put the playinto mr</s>  harriss hands it was at that time at least double the lengthof any acting comedy</s>  i profited by his judgment and experience in thecurtailing of ittill i believe his feeling for the vanity of ayoung author got the better of his desire for correctness and he leftmany excrescences remaining because he had assisted in pruning so manymore</s>  hence though i was not uninformed that the acts were still toolong i flattered myself that after the first trial i might withsafer judgment proceed to remove what should appear to have been mostdissatisfactory</s>  many other errors there were which might in part havearisen from my being by no means conversant with plays in generaleither in reading or at the theatre</s>  yet i own that in one respect idid not regret my ignorance for as my first wish in attempting a playwas to avoid every appearance of plagiary i thought i should stand abetter chance of effecting this from being in a walk which i had notfrequented and where consequently the progress of invention was lesslikely to be interrupted by starts of recollection for on subjects onwhich the mind has been much informed invention is slow of exertingitself</s>  faded ideas float in the fancy like halfforgotten dreams andthe imagination in its fullest enjoyments becomes suspicious of itsoffspring and doubts whether it has created or adopted</s> with regard to some particular passages which on the first nightsrepresentation seemed generally disliked i confess that if i felt anyemotion of surprise at the disapprobation it was not that they weredisapproved of but that i had not before perceived that they deservedit</s>  as some part of the attack on the piece was begun too early to passfor the sentence of judgment which is ever tardy in condemning ithas been suggested to me that much of the disapprobation must havearisen from virulence of malice rather than severity of criticism butas i was more apprehensive of there being just grounds to excite thelatter than conscious of having deserved the former i continue not tobelieve that probable which i am sure must have been unprovoked</s> however if it was so and i could even mark the quarter from whence itcame it would be ungenerous to retort for no passion suffers morethan malice from disappointment</s>  for my own part i see no reason whythe author of a play should not regard a first nights audience as acandid and judicious friend attending in behalf of the public at hislast rehearsal</s>  if he can dispense with flattery he is sure at leastof sincerity and even though the annotation be rude he may rely uponthe justness of the comment</s>  considered in this light that audiencewhose fiat is essential to the poets claim whether his object befame or profit has surely a right to expect some deference to itsopinion from principles of politeness at least if not from gratitude</s> as for the little puny critics who scatter their peevish strictures inprivate circles and scribble at every author who has the eminence ofbeing unconnected with them as they are usually spleenswoln from avain idea of increasing their consequence there will always be founda petulance and illiberality in their remarks which should place themas far beneath the notice of a gentleman as their original dulness hadsunk them from the level of the most unsuccessful author</s> it is not without pleasure that i catch at an opportunity of justifyingmyself from the charge of intending any national reflection in thecharacter of sir lucius otrigger</s>  if any gentlemen opposed the piecefrom that idea i thank them sincerely for their opposition and if thecondemnation of this comedy however misconceived the provocationcould have added one spark to the decaying flame of national attachmentto the country supposed to be reflected on i should have been happy inits fate and might with truth have boasted that it had done more realservice in its failure than the successful morality of a thousandstagenovels will ever effect</s> it is usual i believe to thank the performers in a new play for theexertion of their several abilities</s>  but where as in this instancetheir merit has been so striking and uncontroverted as to call for thewarmest and truest applause from a number of judicious audiences thepoets afterpraise comes like the feeble acclamation of a child toclose the shouts of a multitude</s>  the conduct however of theprincipals in a theatre cannot be so apparent to the public</s>  i thinkit therefore but justice to declare that from this theatre the onlyone i can speak of from experience those writers who wish to try thedramatic line will meet with that candour and liberal attention whichare generally allowed to be better calculated to lead genius intoexcellence than either the precepts of judgment or the guidance ofexperience</s> the author      dramatis personae as originally acted at covent garden theatre in 1775 sir anthony absolute captain absolute
