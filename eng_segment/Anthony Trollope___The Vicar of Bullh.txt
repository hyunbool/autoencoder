the vicar of bullhampton</s> byanthony trollope</s> with thirty illustrations by h</s>  woods</s> illustration waitingroom at the assize court</s>  frontispieceillustration for title pagelondonbradbury evans and co</s>  11 bouverie street</s> 1870</s> preface</s> the writing of prefaces is for the most part work thrown away andthe writing of a preface to a novel is almost always a vain thing</s> nevertheless i am tempted to prefix a few words to this novel onits completion not expecting that many people will read them butdesirous in doing so of defending myself against a charge which maypossibly be made against me by the criticsas to which i shall beunwilling to revert after it shall have been preferred</s> i have introduced in the vicar of bullhampton the character of a girlwhom i will callfor want of a truer word that shall not in itstruth be offensivea castaway</s>  i have endeavoured to endow her withqualities that may create sympathy and i have brought her back atlast from degradation at least to decency</s>  i have not married her toa wealthy lover and i have endeavoured to explain that though therewas possible to her a way out of perdition still things could not bewith her as they would have been had she not fallen</s> there arises of course the question whether a novelist whoprofesses to write for the amusement of the young of both sexesshould allow himself to bring upon his stage such a character as thatof carry brattle</s>  it is not long sinceit is well within the memoryof the authorthat the very existence of such a condition of lifeas was hers was supposed to be unknown to our sisters and daughtersand was in truth unknown to many of them</s>  whether that ignorancewas good may be questioned but that it exists no longer is beyondquestion</s>  then arises that further questionhow far the conditionof such unfortunates should be made a matter of concern to the sweetyoung hearts of those whose delicacy and cleanliness of thought is amatter of pride to so many of us</s>  cannot women who are good pitythe sufferings of the vicious and do something perhaps to mitigateand shorten them without contamination from the vice</s>  it will beadmitted probably by most men who have thought upon the subject thatno fault among us is punished so heavily as that fault often solight in itself but so terrible in its consequences to the lessfaulty of the two offenders by which a woman falls</s>  all her own sexis against herand all those of the other sex in whose veins runsthe blood which she is thought to have contaminated and who ofnature would befriend her were her trouble any other than it is</s> she is what she is and remains in her abject pitiless unutterablemisery because this sentence of the world has placed her beyondthe helping hand of love and friendship</s>  it may be said no doubtthat the severity of this judgment acts as a protection to femalevirtuedeterring as all known punishments do deter from vice</s>  butthis punishment which is horrible beyond the conception of those whohave not regarded it closely is not known beforehand</s>  instead of thepunishment there is seen a false glitter of gaudy lifea glitterwhich is damnably falseand which alas has been more oftenportrayed in glowing colours for the injury of young girls thanhave those horrors which ought to deter with the dark shadowingswhich belong to them</s> to write in fiction of one so fallen as the noblest of her sex asone to be rewarded because of her weakness as one whose life ishappy bright and glorious is certainly to allure to vice andmisery</s>  but it may perhaps be possible that if the matter be handledwith truth to life some girl who would have been thoughtless maybe made thoughtful or some parents heart may be softened</s>  it mayalso at last be felt that this misery is worthy of alleviation as isevery misery to which humanity is subject</s> a</s>  t</s> contents i</s>  bullhampton

bullhampton</s> illustrationi am disposed to believe that no novel reader in england has seen thelittle town of bullhampton in wiltshire except such novel readersas live there and those others very few in number who visit itperhaps four times a year for the purposes of trade and who areknown as commercial gentlemen</s>  bullhampton is seventeen miles fromsalisbury eleven from marlborough nine from westbury seven fromhaylesbury and five from the nearest railroad station which iscalled bullhampton road and lies on the line from salisbury toycovil</s>  it is not quite on salisbury plain but probably was so oncewhen salisbury plain was wider than it is now</s>  whether it should becalled a small town or a large village i cannot say</s>  it has no mayorand no market but it has a fair</s>  there rages a feud in bullhamptontouching this want of a market as there are certain bullhamptoniteswho aver that the charter giving all rights of a market tobullhampton does exist and that at one period in its history themarket existed alsofor a year or two but the three bakers andtwo butchers are opposed to change and the patriots of the placethough they declaim on the matter over their evening pipes andginandwater have not enough of matutinal zeal to carry out theirpurpose</s>  bullhampton is situated on a little river which meandersthrough the chalky ground and has a quiet slow dreamy prettinessof its own</s>  a mile above the townfor we will call it a townthestream divides itself into many streamlets and there is a districtcalled the water meads in which bridges are more frequent thantrustworthy in which there are hundreds of little sluicegates forregulating the irrigation and a growth of grass which is a sourceof much anxiety and considerable trouble to the farmers</s>  there is awatermill here too very low with ever a floury mealy look witha pasty look often as the flour becomes damp with the spray of thewater as it is thrown by the millwheel</s>  it seems to be a tatteredshattered ramshackle concern but it has been in the same familyfor many years and as the family has not hitherto been in distressit may be supposed that the mill still affords a fair means oflivelihood</s>  the brattlesfor jacob brattle is the millersnamehave ever been known as men who paid their way and were ableto hold up their heads</s>  but nevertheless jacob brattle is ever atwar with his landlord in regard to repairs wanted for his milland mr</s>  gilmore the landlord in question declares that he wishesthat the avon would some night run so high as to carry off the millaltogether</s>  bullhampton is very quiet</s>  there is no special tradein the place</s>  its interests are altogether agricultural</s>  it hasno newspaper</s>  its tendencies are altogether conservative</s>  it isa good deal given to religion and the primitive methodists havea very strong holding there although in all wiltshire there isnot a clergyman more popular in his own parish than the rev</s>  frankfenwick</s>  he himself in his inner heart rather likes his rivalmr</s>  puddleham the dissenting minister because mr</s>  puddleham is anearnest man who in spite of the intensity of his ignorance isefficacious among the poor</s>  but mr</s>  fenwick is bound to keep up thefight and mr</s>  puddleham considers it to be his duty to put down mr</s> fenwick and the church establishment altogether</s> the men of bullhampton and the women also are aware that the gloryhas departed from them in that bullhampton was once a borough andreturned two members to parliament</s>  no borough more close or shallwe say more rotten ever existed</s>  it was not that the marquis oftrowbridge had what has often delicately been called an interest init but he held it absolutely in his breeches pocket to do with itas he liked and it had been the liking of the late marquis to sellone of the seats at every election to the highest bidder on his sidein politics</s>  nevertheless the people of bullhampton had gloriedin being a borough and the shame or at least the regret of theirdownfall had not yet altogether passed away when the tidings ofa new reform bill came upon them</s>  the people of bullhampton arenotoriously slow to learn and slow to forget</s>  it was told of afarmer of bullhampton in old days that he asked what had become ofcharles i</s>  when told that charles ii</s>  had been restored</s>  cromwellhad come and gone and had not disturbed him at bullhampton</s> at bullhampton there is no public building except the church whichindeed is a very handsome edifice with a magnificent tower a thingto go to see and almost as worthy of a visit as its neighbour thecathedral at salisbury</s>  the body of the church is somewhat low butits yellowgray colour is perfect and there is moreover a normandoor and there are early english windows in the aisle and aperfection of perpendicular architecture in the chancel all of whichshould bring many visitors to bullhampton and there are brasses inthe nave very curious and one or two tombs of the gilmore familyvery rare in their construction and the churchyard is large andgreen and bowery with the avon flowing close under it and nooks init which would make a man wish to die that he might be buried there</s> the church and churchyard of bullhampton are indeed perfect and yetbut few people go to see it</s>  it has not as yet had its own bard tosing its praises</s>  properly it is called bullhampton monachorum theliving having belonged to the friars of chiltern</s>  the great tithesnow go to the earl of todmorden who has no other interest in theplace whatever and who never saw it</s>  the benefice belongs to st</s> johns oxford and as the vicarage is not worth more than 400 ayear it happens that a clergyman generally accepts it before he haslived for twenty or thirty years in the common room of his college</s> mr</s>  fenwick took it on his marriage when he was about twentysevenand bullhampton has been lucky</s> the bulk of the parish belongs to the marquis of trowbridge whohowever has no residence within ten miles of it</s>  the squire of theparish is squire gilmoreharry gilmoreand he possesses everyacre in it that is not owned by the marquis</s>  with the village ortown as it may be mr</s>  gilmore has no concern but he owns a largetract of the water meads and again has a farm or two up on thedowns as you go towards chiltern</s>  but they lie out of the parish ofbullhampton</s>  altogether he is a man of about fifteen hundred a yearand as he is not as yet married many a wiltshire mothers eye isturned towards hampton privets as mr</s>  gilmores house is somewhatfantastically named</s> mr</s>  gilmores character must be made to develope itself in thesepagesif such developing may be accomplished</s>  he is to be ourheroor at least one of two</s>  the author will not in these earlywords declare that the squire will be his favourite hero as hewill wish that his readers should form their own opinions on thatmatter</s>  at this period he was a man somewhat over thirtyperhapsthirtythree years of age who had done fairly well at harrow and atoxford but had never done enough to make his friends regard him as aswan</s>
 he still read a good deal but he shot and fished more than heread and had become since his residence at the privets very fondof the outside of his books</s>  nevertheless he went on buying booksand was rather proud of his library</s>  he had travelled a good dealand was a politiciansomewhat scandalising his own tenants andother bullhamptonites by voting for the liberal candidates for hisdivision of the county</s>  the marquis of trowbridge did not know himbut regarded him as an objectionable person who did not understandthe nature of the duties which devolved upon him as a countrygentleman and the marquis himself was always spoken of by mr</s> gilmore asan idiot</s>  on these various grounds the squire hashitherto regarded himself as being a little in advance of othersquires and has perhaps given himself more credit than he hasdeserved for intellectuality</s>  but he is a man with a good heart anda pure mind generous desirous of being just somewhat sparing ofthat which is his own never desirous of that which is anothers</s>  heis goodlooking though perhaps somewhat ordinary in appearancetall strong with darkbrown hair and darkbrown whiskers withsmall quick grey eyes and teeth which are almost too white and tooperfect for a man</s>  perhaps it is his greatest fault that he thinksthat as a liberal politician and as an english country gentleman hehas combined in his own position all that is most desirable uponearth</s>  to have the acres without the acreladen brains is hethinks everything</s> and now it may be as well told at once that mr</s>  gilmore is over headand ears in love with a young lady to whom he has offered his handand all that can be made to appertain to the future mistress ofhampton privets</s>  and the lady is one who has nothing to give inreturn but her hand and her heart and herself</s>  the neighbours allround the country have been saying for the last five years that harrygilmore was looking out for an heiress for it has always been toldof harry especially among those who have opposed him in politicsthat he had a keen eye for the main chance</s>  but mary lowther has notand never can have a penny with which to make up for any deficiencyin her own personal attributes</s>  but mary is a lady and harry gilmorethinks her the sweetest woman on whom his eye ever rested</s>  whateverresolutions as to fortunehunting he may have madethough probablynone were ever madethey have all now gone to the winds</s>  he is soabsolutely in love that nothing in the world is to him at presentworth thinking about except mary lowther</s>  i do not doubt that hewould vote for a conservative candidate if mary lowther so orderedhim or consent to go and live in new york if mary lowther wouldaccept him on no other condition</s>  all bullhampton parish is nothingto him at the present moment except as far as it is connected withmary lowther</s>  hampton privets is dear to him only as far as it can bemade to look attractive in the eyes of mary lowther</s>  the mill is tobe repaired though he knows he will never get any interest on theoutlay because mary lowther has said that bullhampton watermeadswould be destroyed if the mill were to tumble down</s>  he has drawn forhimself mental pictures of mary lowther till he has invested her withevery charm and grace and virtue that can adorn a woman</s>  in verytruth he believes her to be perfect</s>  he is actually and absolutely inlove</s>  mary lowther has hitherto neither accepted nor rejected him</s> in a very few lines further on we will tell how the matter standsbetween them</s> it has already been told that the rev</s>  frank fenwick is vicar ofbullhampton</s>  perhaps he was somewhat guided in his taking of theliving by the fact that harry gilmore the squire of the parishhad been his very intimate friend at oxford</s>  fenwick at the periodwith which we are about to begin our story had been six years atbullhampton and had been married about five and a half</s>  of himsomething has already been said and perhaps it may be only necessaryfurther to state that he is a tall fairhaired man already becomingsomewhat bald on the top of his head with bright eyes and theslightest possible amount of whiskers and a look about his nose andmouth which seems to imply that he could be severe if he were not sothoroughly goodhumoured</s>  he has more of breeding in his appearancethan his frienda show of higher blood though whence comes suchshow and how one discerns that appearance few of us can tell</s>  hewas a man who read more and thought more than harry gilmore thoughgiven much to athletics and very fond of field sports</s>  it shallonly further be said of frank fenwick that he esteemed both hischurchwardens and his bishop and was afraid of neither</s> his wife had been a miss balfour from loring in gloucestershireand had had some considerable fortune</s>  she was now the mother offour children and as fenwick used to say might have fourteen foranything he knew</s>  but as he also had possessed some small meansof his own there was no poverty or prospect of poverty at thevicarage and the babies were made welcome as they came</s>  mrs</s>  fenwickis as good a specimen of an english country parsons wife as youshall meet in a countygay goodlooking fond of the societyaround her with a little dash of fun knowing in blankets andcorduroys and coals and tea knowing also as to beer and gin andtobacco acquainted with every man and woman in the parish thinkingher husband to be quite as good as the squire in regard to positionand to be infinitely superior to the squire or any other man inthe world in regard to his personal selfa handsome pleasantwelldressed lady who has no nonsense about her</s>  such a one was andis mrs</s>  fenwick</s> now the balfours were considerable people at loring though theirproperty was not county property and it was always considered thatjanet balfour might have done better than she did in a worldly pointof view</s>  of that however little had been said at loring because itsoon became known there that she and her husband stood rather well inthe country round about bullhampton and when she asked mary lowtherto come and stay with her for six months mary lowthers aunt missmarrable had nothing to say against the arrangement although sheherself was a most particular old lady and always remembered thatmary lowther was third or fourth cousin to some earl in scotland</s> nothing more shall be said of miss marrable at present as it isexpedient for the sake of the story that the reader should fix hisattention on bullhampton till he find himself quite at home there</s> i would wish him to know his way among the water meads to be quitealive to the fact that the lodge of hampton privets is a mile and aquarter to the north of bullhampton church and half a mile acrossthe fields west from brattles mill that mr</s>  fenwicks parsonageadjoins the churchyard being thus a little farther from hamptonprivets than the church and that there commences bullhampton streetwith its innthe trowbridge arms its four publichouses its threebakers and its two butchers</s>  the bounds of the parsonage run downto the river so that the vicar can catch his trout from his ownbankthough he much prefers to catch them at distances which admitof the appurtenances of sport</s> now there must be one word of mary lowther and then the story shallbe commenced</s>  she had come to the vicarage in may intending to staya month and it was now august and she had been already three monthswith her friend</s>  everybody said that she was staying because sheintended to become the mistress of hampton privets</s>  it was a monthsince harry gilmore had formally made his offer and as she had notrefused him and as she still stayed on the folk of bullhampton werejustified in their conclusions</s>  she was a tall girl with dark brownhair which she wore fastened in a knot at the back of her headafter the simplest fashion</s>  her eyes were large and grey and fullof lustre but they were not eyes which would make you say that marylowther was especially a brighteyed girl</s>  they were eyes howeverwhich could make you think when they looked at you that if marylowther would only like you how happy your lot would bethat ifshe would love you the world would have nothing higher or better tooffer</s>  if you judged her face by any rules of beauty you would saythat it was too thin but feeling its influence with sympathy youcould never wish it to be changed</s>  her nose and mouth were perfect</s> how many little noses there are on young womens faces which ofthemselves cannot be said to be things of beauty or joys for everalthough they do very well in their places</s>  there is the softnessand colour of youth and perhaps a dash of fun and the eyes aboveare bright and the lips below alluring</s>  in the midst of such sweetcharms what does it matter that the nose be puggishor even anose of putty such as you think you might improve in the originalmaterial by a squeeze of your thumb and forefinger</s>  but with marylowther her nose itself was a feature of exquisite beauty a featurethat could be eloquent with pity reverence or scorn</s>  the curves ofthe nostrils with their almost transparent membranes told of theworking of the mind within as every portion of human face shouldtellin some degree</s>  and the mouth was equally expressive thoughthe lips were thin</s>  it was a mouth to watch and listen to and readwith curious interest rather than a mouth to kiss</s>  not but thatthe desire to kiss would come when there might be a hope to kisswith favourbut they were lips which no man would think to ravagein boisterous play</s>  it might have been said that there was a wantof capability for passion in her face had it not been for thewellmarked dimple in her little chinthat soft couch in which onemay be always sure when one sees it that some little imp of lovelies hidden</s> it has already been said that mary lowther was talltaller thancommon</s>  her back was as lovely a form of womanhood as mans eye evermeasured and appreciated</s>  her movements which were never naturallyquick had a grace about them which touched men and women alike</s>  itwas the very poetry of motion but its chief beauty consisted inthis that it was what it was by no effort of her own</s>  we have allseen those efforts and it may be that many of us have liked themwhen they have been made on our own behalf</s>  but no man as yet couldever have felt himself to be so far flattered by miss lowther</s>  herdress was very plain as it became her that it should be for she wasliving on the kindness of an aunt who was herself not a rich woman</s> but it may be doubted whether dress could have added much to hercharms</s> she was now turned oneandtwenty and though doubtless there wereyoung men at loring who had sighed for her smiles no young man hadsighed with any efficacy</s>  it must be acknowledged indeed that shewas not a girl for whom the most susceptible of young men would sigh</s> young men given to sigh are generally attracted by some outward andvisible sign of softness which may be taken as an indication thatsighing will produce some result however small</s>  at loring it wassaid that mary lowther was cold and repellent and on that accountone who might very probably descend to the shades as an old maid inspite of the beauty of which she was the acknowledged possessor</s>  noenemy no friend had ever accused her of being a flirt</s> such as she was harry gilmores passion for her much astonished hisfriends</s>  those who knew him best had thought that as regarded hisfate matrimonialor nonmatrimonialthere were three chancesbefore him he might carry out their presumed intention of marryingmoney or he might become the sudden spoil of the bow and spear ofsome redcheeked lass or he might walk on as an old bachelor toocautious to be caught at all</s>  but none believed that he would becomethe victim of a grand passion for a poor reticent highbredhighminded specimen of womanhood</s>  such however was now hiscondition</s> he had an uncle a clergyman living at salisbury a prebendarythere who was a man of the world and in whom harry trusted morethan in any other member of his own family</s>  his mother had beenthe sister of the rev</s>  henry fitzackerly chamberlaine and as mr</s> chamberlaine had never married much of his solicitude was bestowedupon his nephew</s> dont my dear fellow had been the prebendarys advice when he wastaken over to see miss lowther</s>  she is a lady no doubt but youwould never be your own master and you would be a poor man till youdied</s>  an easy temper and a little money are almost as common in ourrank of life as destitution and obstinacy</s>  on the day after thisadvice was given harry gilmore made his formal offer</s> chapter ii</s> flos red ball</s> you should give him an answer dear one way or the other</s>  thesewise words were spoken by mrs</s>  fenwick to her friend as they sattogether with their work in their hands on a garden seat under acedar tree</s>  it was an august evening after dinner and the vicar wasout about his parish</s>  the two elder children were playing in thegarden and the two young women were alone together</s> illustration you should give him an answer dear one wayor the other</s> of course i shall give him an answer</s>  what answer does he wish</s> you know what answer he wishes</s>  if any man was ever in earnest heis</s> am i not doing the best i can for him then in waitingto seewhether i can say yes</s> it cannot be well for him to be in suspense on such a matter anddear mary it cannot be well for you either</s>  one always feels thatwhen a girl bids a man to wait she will take him after a while</s>  italways comes to that</s>  if you had been at home at loring the timewould not have been much but being so near to him and seeing himevery day must be bad</s>  you must both be in a state of fever</s> then i will go back to loring</s> no not now till you have positively made up your mind and givenhim an answer one way or the other</s>  you could not go now and leavehim in doubt</s>  take him at once and have done with it</s>  he is as goodas gold</s> in answer to this mary for a while said nothing but went sedulouslyon with her work</s> mamma said a little girl running up followed by a nurserymaidthe balls in the water</s> the child was a beautiful fairhaired little darling aboutfourandahalf years old and a boy a year younger and a littleshorter and a little stouter was toddling after her</s> the ball in the water flo</s>  cant jim get it out</s> jims gone mamma</s> then jane the nurserymaid proceeded to explain that the ball hadrolled in and had been carried down the stream to some bushes andthat it was caught there just out of reach of all that she janecould do with a long stick for its recovery</s>  jim the gardener wasnot to be found and they were in despair lest the ball should becomewet through and should perish</s> mary at once saw her opportunity of escapeher opportunity for thatfive minutes of thought by herself which she needed</s>  ill come floand see what can be done said mary</s> do cause you is so big said the little girl</s> well see if my long arms wont do as well as jims said maryonly jim would go in perhaps which i certainly shall not do</s>  thenshe took flo by the hand and together they ran down to the margin ofthe river</s> there lay the treasure a huge red inflated ball just stopped in itsdownward current by a short projecting stick</s>  jim could have got itcertainly because he could have suspended himself over the streamfrom a bough and could have dislodged the ball and have floated iton to the bank</s> lean over marya great deal and well hold you said flo towhom her ball was at this moment worth any effort</s>  mary did leanover and poked at it and at last thought that she would trustherself to the bough as jim would have done and became moreand more venturous and at last touched the ball and then atlastfell into the river</s>  immediately there was a scream and aroar and a splashing about of skirts and petticoats and by thetime that mrs</s>  fenwick was on the bank mary lowther had extricatedherself and had triumphantly brought out flos treasure with her</s> mary are you hurt</s>  said her friend</s> what should hurt me</s>  oh dear oh dear</s>  i never fell into a riverbefore</s>  my darling flo dont be unhappy</s>  its such good fun</s>  onlyyou mustnt fall in yourself till youre as big as i am</s>  flo was inan agony of tears not deigning to look at the rescued ball</s> you do not mean that your head has been under</s>  said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> my face was and i felt so odd</s>  for about half a moment i had asound of ophelia in my ears</s>  then i was laughing at myself for beingsuch a goose</s> youd better come up and go to bed dear and ill get you somethingwarm</s> i wont go to bed and i wont have anything warm but i will changemy clothes</s>  what an adventure</s>  what will mr</s>  fenwick say</s> what will mr</s>  gilmore say</s>  to this mary lowther made no answer butwent straight up to the house and into her room and changed herclothes</s> while she was there fenwick and gilmore both appeared at the openwindow of the drawingroom in which mrs</s>  fenwick was sitting</s>  she hadknown well enough that harry gilmore would not let the evening passwithout coming to the vicarage and at one time had hoped to persuademary lowther to give her verdict on this very day</s>  both she and herhusband were painfully anxious that harry might succeed</s>  fenwick hadloved the man dearly for many years and janet fenwick had loved himsince she had known him as her husbands friend</s>  they both felt thathe was showing more of manhood than they had expected from him in thepersistency of his love and that he deserved his reward</s>  and theyboth believed also that for mary herself it would be a prosperous anda happy marriage</s>  and then where is the married woman who does notwish that the maiden friend who comes to stay with her should find ahusband in her house</s>  the parson and his wife were altogether of onemind in this matter and thought that mary lowther ought to be madeto give herself to harry gilmore</s> what do you think has happened</s>  said mrs</s>  fenwick coming to thewindow which opened down to the ground</s>  mary lowther has falleninto the river</s> fallen where</s>  shouted gilmore putting up both his hands andseeming to prepare himself to rush away among the river gods insearch of his love</s> dont be alarmed mr</s>  gilmore shes upstairs quite safeonly shehas had a ducking</s>  then the circumstances were explained and thepapa declared magisterially that flo must not play any more with herball near the riveran order to which it was not probable that muchclose attention would ever be paid</s> i suppose miss lowther will have gone to bed</s>  said gilmore</s> on the contrary i expect her every moment</s>  i suggested bed andwarm drinks and cossetting but she would have none of it</s>  shescrambled out all by herself and seemed to think it very good fun</s> come in at any rate and have some tea said the vicar</s>  if youstart before eleven ill walk half the way back with you</s> in the mean time in spite of her accident mary had gained theopportunity that she had required</s>  the point for selfmeditation wasnot so much whether she would or would not accept mr</s>  gilmore nowas that other pointwas she or was she not wrong to keep him insuspense</s>  she knew very well that she would not accept him now</s>  itseemed to her that a girl should know a man very thoroughly beforeshe would be justified in trusting herself altogether to his handsand she thought that her knowledge of mr</s>  gilmore was insufficient</s> it might however be the case that in such circumstances duty requiredher to give him at once an unhesitating answer</s>  she did not findherself to be a bit nearer to knowing him and to loving him than shewas a month since</s>  her friend janet had complained again and again ofthe suspense to which she was subjecting the manbut she knew onthe other hand that her friend janet did this in her intense

turning away to her own room</s> chapter iii</s> sam brattle</s> it was about eleven oclock when gilmore passed through the wicketleading from the vicarage garden to the churchyard</s>  the path he wasabout to take crossed simply a corner of the church precincts as itcame at once upon a public footway leading from the fields throughthe churchyard to the town</s>  there was of course no stopping thepublic path but fenwick had been often advised to keep a lock on hisown gate as otherwise it almost seemed that the vicarage gardenswere open to all bullhampton</s>  but the lock had never been put on</s>  thegate was the way by which he and his family went to the church andthe parson was accustomed to say that however many keys there mightbe provided he knew that there would never be one in his pocketwhen he wanted it</s>  and he was wont to add when his wife would teasehim on the subject that they who desired to come in decently werewelcome and that they who were minded to make an entrance indecentlywould not be debarred by such rails and fences as hemmed in thevicarage grounds</s>  gilmore as he passed through the corner of thechurchyard clearly saw a man standing near to the stile leading fromthe fields</s>  indeed this man was quite close to him although fromthe want of light and the posture of the man the face was invisibleto him</s>  but he knew the fellow to be a stranger to bullhampton</s>  thedress was strange the manner was strange and the mode of standingwas strange</s>  gilmore had lived at bullhampton all his life andwithout much thought on the subject knew bullhampton ways</s>  thejacket which the man wore was a townmade jacket a jacket that hadcome farther afield even than salisbury and the mans gaiters had asavour which was decidedly not of wiltshire</s>  dark as it was he couldsee so much as this</s>  good night my friend said gilmore in asharp cheery voice</s>  the man muttered something and passed on asthough to the village</s>  there had however been something in hisposition which made gilmore think that the stranger had intendedto trespass on his friends garden</s>  he crossed the stile into thefields however without waitingwithout having waited for half amoment and immediately saw the figure of a second man standing downhidden as it were in the ditch and though he could discover no morethan the cap and shoulders of the man through the gloom he was surehe knew who it was that owned the cap and shoulders</s>  he did not speakagain but passed on quickly thinking what he might best do</s>  theman whom he had seen and recognised had latterly been talked of as adiscredit to his family and anything but an honour to the usuallyrespectable inhabitants of bullhampton</s> on the further side of the church from the town was a farmyard inthe occupation of one of lord trowbridges tenantsa man who hadever been very keen at preventing the inroads of trespassers towhich he had perhaps been driven by the fact that his land wastraversed by various public pathways</s>  now a public pathway throughpasture is a nuisance as it is impossible to induce those who useit to keep themselves to one beaten track but a pathway throughcornfields is worse for let what pains may be taken wheatbeans and barley will be torn down and trampled under foot</s>  andyet in apportioning his rents no landlord takes all this intoconsideration</s>  farmer trumbull considered it a good deal and wasoften a wrathful man</s>  there was at any rate no right of way acrosshis farmyard and here he might keep as big a dog as he chosechained or unchained</s>  harry gilmore knew the dog well and stood fora moment leaning on the gate</s> who be there</s>  said the voice of the farmer</s> is that you mr</s>  trumbull</s>  it is imr</s>  gilmore</s>  i want to getround to the front of the parsons house</s> zurely zurely said the farmer coming forward and opening thegate</s>  be there anything wrong about squire</s> i dont know</s>  i think there is</s>  speak softly</s>  i fancy there are menlying in the churchyard</s> i be athinking so too squire</s>  bonem was a growling just now likethe old un</s>  bonem was the name of the bulldog as to which gilmorehad been solicitous as he looked over the gate</s>  what ist teyre upto</s>  not bugglary</s> our friends apricots perhaps</s>  but ill just move round to thefront</s>  do you and bonem keep a lookout here</s> never fear squire never fear</s>  me and bonem together is amost toomuch for em bugglars and all</s>  then he led mr</s>  gilmore through thefarmyard and out on to the road bonem growling a low growl as hepassed away</s> the squire hurried along the high road past the church and in atthe vicarage front gate</s>  knowing the place well he could have madehis way round into the garden but he thought it better to go tothe front door</s>  there was no light to be seen from the windows butalmost all the rooms of the house looked out into the garden at theback</s>  he knocked sharply and in a minute or two the door was openedby the parson in person</s> frank said the squire</s> halloo</s>  is that you</s>  whats up now</s> men who ought to be in bed</s>  i came across two men hanging about yourgate in the churchyard and im not sure there wasnt a third</s> theyre up to nothing</s>  they often sit and smoke there</s> these fellows were up to something</s>  the man i saw plainest was astranger and just the sort of man who wont do your parishioners anygood to be among them</s>  the other was sam brattle</s> whewww said the parson</s> he has gone utterly to the dogs said the squire</s> hes on the road harry but nobody has gone while hes still going</s> i had some words with him in his fathers presence last week andhe followed me afterwards and told me hed see it out with me</s>  iwouldnt tell you because i didnt want to set you more againstthem</s> i wish they were out of the placethe whole lot of them</s> i dont know that theyd do better elsewhere than here</s>  i supposemr</s>  sam is going to keep his word with me</s> only for the look of that other fellow i shouldnt think they meantanything serious said gilmore</s> i dont suppose they do but ill be on the lookout</s> shall i stay with you frank</s> oh no ive a lifepreserver and ill take a round of the gardens</s> you come with me and you can pass home that way</s>  the chancesare theyll mizzle away to bed as theyve seen you and heardbonemand probably heard too every word you said to trumbull</s> he then got his hat and the short thick stick of which he hadspoken and turning the key of the door put it in his pocket</s>  thenthe two friends went round by the kitchen garden and so through tothe orchard and down to the churchyard gate</s>  hitherto they had seennothing and heard nothing and fenwick was sure that the men hadmade their way through the churchyard to the village</s> but they may come back said gilmore</s> ill be about if they do said the parson</s> what is one against three</s>  you had better let me stay</s> fenwick laughed at this saying that it would be quite as rational topropose that they should keep watch every night</s> but hark</s>  said the squire with a mind evidently perturbed</s> dont you be alarmed about us said the parson</s> if anything should happen to mary lowther</s> that no doubt is matter of anxiety to which may perhaps beadded some trifle of additional feeling on the score of janet and thechildren</s>  but ill do my best</s>  if the women knew that you and i werepatrolling the place theyd be frightened out of their wits</s> then gilmore who never liked that there should be a laugh againsthimself took his leave and walked home across the fields</s>  fenwickpassed up through the garden and when he was near the terrace whichran along the garden front of the house he thought that he hearda voice</s>  he stood under the shade of a wall dark with ivy anddistinctly heard whispering on the other side of it</s>  as far as hecould tell there were the voices of more than two men</s>  he wished nowthat he had kept gilmore with himnot that he was personally afraidof the trespassers for his courage was of that steady settled kindwhich enables the possessor to remember that men who are doing deedsof darkness are ever afraid of those whom they are injuring but hadthere been an ally with him his prospect of catching one or more ofthe ruffians would have been greatly increased</s>  standing where he washe would probably be able to interrupt them should they attempt toenter the house but in the mean time they might be stripping hisfruit from the wall</s>  they were certainly at present in the kitchengarden and he was not minded to leave them there at such work asthey might have in hand</s>  having paused to think of this he creptalong under the wall close to the house towards the passage bywhich he could reach them</s>  but they had not heard him nor had theywaited among the fruit</s>  when he was near the corner of the wall oneleading man came round within a foot or two of the spot on which hestood and before he could decide on what he would do the secondhad appeared</s>  he rushed forward with the loaded stick in his handbut knowing its weight and remembering the possibility of thecomparative innocence of the intruders he hesitated to strike</s>  ablow on the head would have brained a man and a knock on the armwith such an instrument would break the bone</s>  in a moment he foundhis left hand on the leading mans throat and the mans foot behindhis heel</s>  he fell but as he fell he did strike heavily cuttingupwards with his weapon and bringing the heavy weight of lead at theend of it on to the mans shoulder</s>  he stumbled rather than fell butwhen he regained his footing the man was gone</s>  that man was goneand two others were following him down towards the gate at the bottomof the orchard</s>  of these two in a few strides he was able to catchthe hindermost and then he found himself wrestling with sam brattle</s> sam said he speaking as well as he could with his short breathif you dont stand ill strike you with the lifepreserver</s> sam made another struggle trying to seize the weapon and the parsonhit him with it on the right arm</s> youve smashed that anyway mr</s>  fenwick said the man</s> i hope not but do you come along with me quietly or ill smashsomething else</s>  ill hit you on the head if you attempt to move away</s> what were you doing here</s> brattle made no answer but walked along towards the house at theparsons left hand the parson holding him the while by the neck ofhis jacket and swinging the lifepreserver in his right hand</s>  inthis way he took him round to the front of the house and then beganto think what he would do with him</s> that after all you should be at this work sam</s> what work is it then</s> prowling about my place after midnight with a couple of strangeblackguards</s> there aint so much harm in that as i knows of</s> who were the men sam</s> who was the men</s> yeswho were they</s> just friends of mine mr</s>  fenwick</s>  i shant say no more about em</s> youve got me and youve smashed my arm and now what is it youreagoing to do with me</s>  i aint done no harmonly just walked aboutlike</s> to tell the truth our friend the parson did not quite know what hemeant to do with the tartar he had caught</s>  there were reasons whichmade him very unwilling to hand over sam brattle to the villageconstable</s>  sam had a mother and sister who were among the vicarsfirst favourites in the parish and though old jacob brattle thefather was not so great a favourite and was a man whom the squirehis landlord held in great disfavour mr</s>  fenwick would desire ifpossible to spare the family</s>  and of sam himself he had had highhopes though those hopes for the last eighteen months had beenbecoming fainter and fainter</s>  upon the whole he was much averse toknocking up the groom the only man who lived on the parsonage excepthimself and dragging sam into the village</s>  i wish i knew he saidwhat you and your friends were going to do</s>  i hardly think it hascome to that with you that youd try to break into the house and cutour throats</s> we warnt after no breaking in nor no cutting of throats mr</s> fenwick</s>  we warnt indeed</s> what shall you do with yourself tonight if i let you off</s> just go home to fathers sir not a foot else shelp me</s> one of your friends as you call them will have to go to thedoctor if i am not very much mistaken for the rap i gave you wasnothing to what he got</s>  youre all right</s> it hurt sir i can tell yebut that wont matter</s> well samthere you may go</s>  i shall be after you tomorrow andthe last word i say to you tonight is thisas far as i can seeyoure on the road to the gallows</s>  it isnt pleasant to be hung andi would advise you to change your road</s>  so saying he let go hishold and stood waiting till sam should have taken his departure</s> dont be acoming after me tomorrow parson please said theman</s> i shall see your mother certainly</s> dontee tell her of my being here mr</s>  fenwick and nobody shantever come anigh this place againnot in the way of prigginganything</s> you fool you</s>  said the parson</s>  do you think that it is to saveanything that i might lose that i let you go now</s>  dont you knowthat the thing i want to save is youyouyou you helpless idlegoodfornothing reprobate</s>  go home and be sure that i shall do thebest i can according to my lights</s>  i fear that my lights are badlights in that they have allowed me to let you go</s> when he had seen sam take his departure through the front gate hereturned to the house

split one fellows back</s>  icaught another but i let him go</s> what on earth do you mean frank</s> then he told her the whole storyhow gilmore had seen the men andhad come up to him how he had gone

really think its worse</s>  i might have murderedthem all if id lost my temperand just for halfadozenapricots</s> and what became of the man you took</s> i let him go</s> without doing anything to him</s> well he got a tap too</s> did you know him</s> yes i knew himwell</s> who was he frank</s> the parson was silent for a moment and then he answered her</s>  it wassam brattle</s> sam brattle

are stiffnecked obstinateillconditioned peoplethat is the men</s>  but i think gilmore hasbeen a little hard on them</s>  the father and brother are honest men</s> comewell go to bed</s> chapter iv</s> there is no one else</s> on the following morning there was of course a considerable amountof conversation at the vicarage as to the affairs of the previousevening</s>  there was first of all an examination of the fruit but asthis was made without taking jem the gardener into confidence nocertain conclusion could be reached</s>  it was clear however that norobbery for the purpose of sale had been made</s>  an apricot or twomight have been taken and perhaps an assault made on an unripepeach</s>  mr</s>  fenwick was himself nearly sure that garden spoliation wasnot the purpose of the assailants though it suited him to let hiswife entertain that idea</s>  the men would hardly have come from thekitchen garden up to the house and round the corner at which he hadmet them if they were seeking fruit</s>  presuming it to have been theirintention to attempt the drawingroom windows he would have expectedto meet them as he did meet them</s>  from the garden the vicar and thetwo ladies went down to the gate and from thence over the stile tofarmer trumbulls farmyard</s>  the farmer had not again seen the menafter the squire had left him nor had he heard them</s>  to him theparson said nothing of his encounter and nothing of that blow onthe mans back</s>  from thence mr</s>  fenwick went on to the town and theladies returned to the vicarage</s> the only person whom the parson at once consulted was thesurgeondr</s>  cuttenden as he was called</s>  no man with an injuredshoulderblade had come to him last night or that morning</s>  a man hesaid might receive a very violent blow on his back in the mannerin which the fellow had been struck and might be disabled for daysfrom any great personal exertion without having a bone broken</s> if the blade of his shoulder were broken the manso thought thedoctorcould not travel far on foot would hardly be able to getaway to any of the neighbouring towns unless he were carried</s>  ofsam brattle the parson said nothing to the doctor but when he hadfinished his mornings work about the town he walked on to the mill</s> in the mean time the two ladies remained at home at the parsonage</s> the excitement occasioned by the events of the previous night wasprobably a little damaged by the knowledge that mr</s>  gilmore wascoming</s>  the coming of mr</s>  gilmore on this occasion was so importantthat even the terrible idea of burglars and the sensation arisingfrom the use of that deadly weapon which had been produced at thebreakfast table during the morning were robbed of some of theirinterest</s>  they did not keep possession of the minds of the two ladiesas they would have done had there been no violent interrupting cause</s> but here was the violent interrupting cause and by the time thatlunch was on the table sam brattle and his comrades were forgotten</s> very little was said between the two women on that morning respectingmr</s>  gilmore</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick who had allowed herself to be convincedthat mary would act with great impropriety if she did not acceptthe man thought that further speech might only render her friendobstinate</s>  mary who knew the inside of her friends mind veryclearly and who loved and respected her friend could hardly fix herown mind</s>  during the past night it had been fixed or nearly fixedtwo different ways</s>  she had first determined that she would refuseher loveras to which resolve for some hours or so she had beenvery firm then that she would accept himas to which she hadever when most that way inclined entertained some doubt as to thepossibility of her uttering that word yes</s>
if it be that other women dont love better than i love him iwonder that they ever get married at all she said to herself</s> she was told that she was wrong to keep the man in suspense and shebelieved it</s>  had she not been so told she would have thought thatsome further waiting would have been of the three alternatives thebest</s> i shall be upstairs with the bairns said mrs</s>  fenwick as she leftthe diningroom after lunch so that if you prefer the garden to thedrawingroom it will be free</s> oh dear how solemn and ceremonious you make it</s> it is solemn mary i dont know how anything can be more solemnshort of going to heaven or the other place</s>  but i really dont seewhy there should be any doubt or difficulty</s> there was something in the tone in which these words were said whichalmost made mary lowther again decide against the man</s>  the man had ahome and an income and was squire of the parish and therefore thereneed be no difficulty</s>  when she compared mr</s>  fenwick and mr</s>  gilmoretogether she found that she liked mr</s>  fenwick the best</s>  she thoughthim to be the more clever the higher spirited the most of a man ofthe two</s>  she certainly was not the least in love with her friendshusband but then she was just as little in love with mr</s>  gilmore</s> at about halfpast two mr</s>  gilmore made his appearance standing atthe open window</s> may i come in</s>  he said</s> of course you may come in</s> mrs</s>  fenwick is not here</s> she is in the house i think if you want her</s> oh no</s>  i hope you were not frightened last night</s>  i have not seenfrank this morning but i hear from mr</s>  trumbull that there wassomething of a row</s> there was a row certainly</s>  mr</s>  fenwick struck some of the men andhe is afraid that he hurt one of them</s> i wish he had broken their heads</s>  i take it there was a son of oneof my tenants there who is about as bad as he can be</s>  frank willbelieve me now</s>  i hope you were not frightened here</s> i heard nothing of it till this morning</s> after that there was a pause</s>  he had told himself as he came alongthat the task before him could not be easy and pleasant</s>  to declare apassion to the girl he loves may be very pleasant work to the man whofeels almost sure that his answer will not be against him</s>  it may bean easy task enough even when there is a doubt</s>  the very possessionof the passionor even its pretencegives the man a liberty whichhe has a pleasure and a pride in using</s>  but this is the case when theman dashes boldly at his purpose without

nothing thati can say now will make you love me</s>  i have not that sort of powerwhich would compel a girl to come into my arms</s> i dont understand that kind of powerhow any man can have it withany

thought that she was sure that she could neverhave that same feeling towards henry gilmore</s>  and yet it might comeor something might come which would do almost as well</s>  it was likelythat janets nature was softer and sweeter than her ownmore proneto adapt itself like ivy to a strong tree</s>  for herself it might bethat she could never become as the ivy but that nevertheless shemight be the true wife of a true husband</s>  but if ever she was to bethe true wife of harry gilmore she could not today say that itshould be so</s> i suppose i must answer you she said very gently</s> if you tell me that you are not ready to do so i will wait and comeagain</s>  i shall never change my mind</s>  you may be sure of that</s> but that is just what i may not do mr</s>  gilmore</s> who says

i did not know of myself that i could become such a slaveto a passion</s>  mary say that you will wait again</s>  try it once more</s> i would not ask for this but that you have told me that there was

change</s>  when threemonths are over i will come to you again</s> she tried to think whether she was bound to tell him that her answermust be taken as final or whether she might allow the matter tostand as he proposed with some chance of a result that might be goodfor him</s>  on one point she was quite surethat if she left him nowwith an understanding that he should again renew his offer

on that subject till they two should besecluded together for the night</s>
chapter v</s> the miller</s> mr</s>  fenwick reached brattles mill about two oclock in the day</s> during the whole morning while saying comfortable words to oldwomen and gently rebuking young maidens he had been thinking of sambrattle and his offences</s>  he had not been in the parish very longnot over five or six years but he had been there long enough to seesam grow out of boyhood into manhood and at his first coming tothe parish for the first two or three years the lad had been afavourite with him</s>
 young brattle could run well leap well fishwell and do a good turn of work about his fathers mill</s>  and hecould also read and write and cast accounts and was a cleverfellow</s>  the parson though he had tried his hand with energy atmaking the man had perhaps done something towards marring him andit may be that some feeling of this was on mr</s>  fenwicks conscience</s> a gentlemans favourite in a country village when of sam brattlesage is very apt to be spoiled by the kindness that is shown to him</s> sam had spent many a long afternoon fishing with the parson butthose fishing days were now more than two years gone by</s>  it had beenunderstood that sam was to assist his father at the mill and muchgood advice as to his trade the lad had received from mr</s>  fenwick</s> there ought to be no more fishing for the young miller excepton special holiday occasionsno more fishing at least duringthe hours required for milling purposes</s>  so mr</s>  fenwick had saidfrequently</s>  nevertheless the old miller attributed his sons idlenessin great part to the parsons conduct and he had so told theparson more than once</s>  of late sam brattle had certainly not beena good son had neglected his work disobeyed his father andbrought trouble on a household which had much suffering to endureindependently of that which he might bring upon it</s> jacob brattle was a man at this time over sixtyfive years of ageand every year of the time had been spent in that mill</s>  he had neverknown another occupation or another home and had very rarely sleptunder another roof</s>  he had married the daughter of a neighbouringfarmer and had had some twelve or fourteen children</s>  there were atthis time six still living</s>  he himself had ever been a hardworkingsober honest man</s>  but he was crossgrained litigious moody andtyrannical</s>  he held his mill and about a hundred acres of adjoiningmeadow land at a rent in which no account was taken either of thebuilding or of the mill privileges attached to it</s>  he paid simply forthe land at a rate per acre which as both he and his landlord wellknew would make it acceptable on the same terms to any farmer in theparish and neither for his mill nor for his land had he any leasenor had his father or his grandfather had leases before him</s>  thoughhe was a clever man in his way he hardly knew what a lease was</s> he doubted whether his landlord could dispossess him as long as hepaid his rent but he was not sure</s>  but of this he thought he wassurethat were mr</s>  gilmore to attempt to do such a thing allwiltshire would cry out against the deed and probably the heavenswould fall and crush the doer</s>  he was a man with an unlimited loveof justice but the justice which he loved best was justice tohimself</s>  he brooded over injuries done to himinjuries real orfanciedtill he taught himself to wish that all who hurt him mightbe crucified for the hurt they did to him</s>  he never forgot and neverwished to forgive</s>  if any prayer came from him it was a prayer thathis own heart might be so hardened that when vengeance came in hisway he might take it without stint against the trespasser of themoment</s>  and yet he was not a cruel man</s>  he would almost despisehimself because when the moment for vengeance did come he wouldabstain from vengeance</s>  he would dismiss a disobedient servant withcurses which would make ones hair stand on end and would hopewithin his heart of hearts that before the end of the next week theman with his wife and children might be in the poorhouse</s>  when theend of the next week came he would send the wife meat and wouldgive the children bread and would despise himself for doing so</s> in matters of religion he was an old pagan going to no place ofworship saying no prayer believing in no creedwith some vagueidea that a supreme power would bring him right at last if he workedhard robbed no one fed his wife and children and paid his way</s>  topay his way was the pride of his heart to be paid on his way was itsjoy</s> in that matter of his quarrel with his landlord he was very bitter</s> the squires father some fifteen years since had given to the millera verbal promise that the house and mill should be repaired</s>  the oldsquire had not been a good man of business and had gone on with histenants very much as he had found them without looking much into theposition of each</s>  but he had no doubt said something that amountedto a promise on his own account as to these repairs</s>  he had died soonafter and the repairs had not been effected</s>  a year after his deathan applicationalmost a demandwas made upon our squire by themiller and the miller had been wrathful even when the squire saidthat he would look into it</s>  the squire did look into it and came tothe conclusion that as he received no rent at all for the house andmill and as his own property would be improved if the house andmill were made to vanish and as he had no evidence whatever of anyundertaking on his fathers part as any such promise on his fatherspart must simply have been a promise of a gift of money out of hisown pocket and further as the miller was impudent he would notrepair the mill</s>  ultimately he offered 20 towards the repairs whichthe miller indignantly refused</s>  readers will be able to imagine howpretty a quarrel there would thus be between the landlord and histenant</s>  when all this was commencingat the time that is of theold squires deathbrattle had the name of being a substantialperson but misfortune had come upon him doctors bills had beenvery heavy his children had drained his resources from him and itwas now known that it set him very hard to pay his way</s>  in regard tothe house and the mill some absolutely essential repairs had beendone at his own costs but the 20 had never been taken</s> in some respects the mans fortune in life had been good</s>  his wifewas one of those loving patient selfdenying almost heavenly humanbeings one or two of whom may come across ones path and who whenfound are generally found in that sphere of life to which this womanbelonged</s>  among the rich there is that difficulty of the needleseye among the poor there is the difficulty of the hardness of theirlives</s>  and the miller loved this woman with a perfect love</s>  he hardlyknew that he loved her as he did</s>  he could be harsh to her andtyrannical</s>  he could say cutting words to her</s>  but at any time in hislife he would have struck over the head with his staff another manwho should have said a word to hurt her</s>  they had lost many childrenbut of the six who remained there were four of whom they might beproud</s>  the eldest was a farmer married and away doing well in a farpart of the county beyond salisbury on the borders of hampshire</s> the father in his emergencies had almost been tempted to ask his sonfor money but hitherto he had refrained</s>  a daughter was married toa tradesman at warminster and was also doing well</s>  a second son whohad once been sickly and weak was a scholar in his way and was nowa schoolmaster also at warminster and in great repute with theparson of the parish there</s>  there was a second daughter fanny athome a girl as good as gold the glory and joy and mainstay of hermother whom even the miller could not scoldwhom all bullhamptonloved</s>  but she was a plain girl brown and somewhat hardvisagedamorsel of fruit as sweet as any in the garden but one that the eyewould not select for its outside grace colour and roundness</s>  thenthere were the two younger</s>  of sam the youngest of all who was nowtwentyone something has already been said</s>  between him and fannythere wasperhaps it will be better to say there had beenanotherdaughter</s>  of all the flock carry had been her fathers darling</s>  shehad not been brown or hardvisaged</s>  she was such a morsel of fruitas men do choose when allowed to range and pick through the wholelength of the garden wall</s>  fair she had been with laughing eyesand floating curls strong in health generous in temper though nowand again with something of her fathers humour</s>  to her mothers eyeshe had never been as sweet as fanny but to her father she had beenas bright and beautiful as the harvest moon</s>  now she was a thingsomewhere never to be mentioned</s>  any man who would have named herto her fathers ears would have encountered instantly the force ofhis wrath</s>  this was so well known in bullhampton that there was notone who would dare to suggest to him even that she might be saved</s> but her mother prayed for her daily and her father thought of heralways</s>  it was a great lump upon him which he must bear to hisgrave and for which there could be no release</s>  he did not knowwhether it was his mind his heart or his body that suffered</s>  heonly knew that it was therea load that could never be lightened</s> what comfort was it to him now that he had beaten a miscreant todeaths doorthat he with his old hands had nearly torn the wretchlimb from limbthat he had left him all but lifeless and had walkedoff scatheless nobody daring to put a finger on him</s>  the man hadbeen pieced up by some doctor and was away in asia in africa inamericasoldiering somewhere</s>  he had been a lieutenant in thosedays and was probably a lieutenant still</s>  it was nothing to oldbrattle where he was</s>  had he been able to drink the fellows blood tothe last drop it would not have lightened his load an ounce</s>  he knewthat it was so now</s>  nothing could lighten itnot though an angelcould come and tell him that his girl was a second magdalen</s>  thebrattles had ever held up their heads</s>  the women at least hadalways been decent</s> jacob brattle himself was a low thickset man with an appearanceof great strength which was now submitting itself very slowly tothe hand of time</s>  he had sharp green eyes and shaggy eyebrows withthin lips and a square chin a nose which though its shape wasaquiline protruded but little from his face</s>  his forehead was lowand broad and he was seldom seen without a flat hat upon his head</s> his hair and very scanty whiskers were gray but then too he wasgray from head to foot</s>  the colour of his trade had so clung to himthat no one could say whether that grayish whiteness of his face camechiefly from meal or from sorrow</s>  he was a silent sad meditativeman thinking always of the evil things that had been done to him</s> chapter vi</s> brattles mill</s> when mr</s>  fenwick reached the mill he found old brattle sitting aloneon a fixed bench in front of the house door with a pipe in his mouth</s> mary lowther was quite right in saying that the mill in spite of itsdilapidationsperhaps by reason of themwas as pretty as anythingin bullhampton</s>  in the first place it was permeated and surrounded bycool bright limpid little streams</s>  one of them ran right throughit as it were passing between the dwellinghouse and the mill andturning the wheel which was there placed</s>  this course was no doubtartificial and the water ran more rapidly in it than it did in theneighbouring streamlets</s>  there were sluicegates too by which itcould be altogether expelled or kept up to this or that height andit was a river absolutely under mans control in which no watergodcould take delight</s>  but there were other natural streams on eachside of the building the one being the main course of the avonand the other some offspring of a brooklet which joined its parenttwo hundred yards below and fifty yards from the spot at whichthe illused working water was received back into its mothersidle bosom</s>  mill and house were thatched and were very low</s>  therewere garrets in the roof but they were so shaped that they couldhardly be said to have walls to them at all so nearly were theycontained by the sloping roof</s>  in front of the building there ran aroadwhich after all was no more than a private lane</s>  it crossedthe smaller stream and the millrun by two wooden bridges but theriver itself had been too large for the bridgemakers efforts andhere there was a ford with steppingstones for foot passengers</s>  thebanks on every side were lined with leaning willows which had beenpollarded over and over again and which with their lightgreen wavyheads gave the place from a distance the appearance of a grove</s> there was a little porch in front of the house and outside of that afixed seat with a high back on which old brattle was sitting whenthe parson accosted him</s>  he did not rise when mr</s>  fenwick addressedhim but he intended no want of courtesy by not doing so</s>  he was onhis legs at business during nearly the whole of the day and whyshould he not rest his old limbs during the few midday minutes whichhe allowed himself for recreation</s> i thought i should catch you idle just at this moment said theclergyman</s> illustration i thought i should catch you idle just atthis moment said the clergyman</s> like enough muster fenwick said the miller i be idle at timesno doubt</s> it would be a bad life if you did notand a very short one too</s> its hot walking i can tell you mr</s>  brattle</s>  if it goes on likethis i shall want a little idle time myself i fear</s>  is sam here</s> no muster fenwick sam is not here</s> nor has been this morning i suppose</s> hes not here now if youre wanting him</s> this the old man said in a tone that seemed to signify some offenceor at least a readiness to take offence if more were said to himabout his son</s>  the clergyman did not sit down but stood close overthe father looking down upon him and the miller went on with hispipe gazing into the clear blue sky</s> i do want him mr</s>  brattle</s>  then he stopped and there was a pause</s> the miller puffed his pipe but said not a word</s>  i do want him</s>  ifear mr</s>  brattle hes not coming to much good</s> who said as he was</s>  i never said so</s>  the ladd have been well enoughif other folks would have let him be</s> i know what you mean mr</s>  brattle</s> i usually intend folks to

great injustice but im not going to argue that withyou now</s>  there would be no use in it</s>  ive come to tell you i fearthat sam was at no good last night</s> thats like enough</s> i had better tell you the truth at once</s>  he was about my place withtwo ruffians</s> and you wants to take him afore the magistrate</s> i want nothing of the kind</s>  i would make almost any sacrificerather</s>  i had him yesterday night by the collar of the coat and ilet him go free</s> if he couldnt shake himself free o you muster fenwick withoutany letting in the matter he aint no son

ax his mother muster fenwick</s>  the truth is i dontcare much to be talking of him at all</s>  its time i was in the mill ibelieve</s>  theres no one much to help me now barring the hired man</s> so saying he got up and passed into the mill without making theslightest form of salutation</s> mr</s>  fenwick paused for a minute looking after the old man and thenwent into the house</s>  he knew very well that his treatment from thewomen would be very different to that which the miller had vouchsafedto him but on that very account it would be difficult for him tomake his communication</s>  he had however known all this before hecame</s>  old brattle would quite of course be silent suspicious anduncivil</s>  it had become the nature of the man to be so and there wasno help for it</s>  but the two women would be glad to see himwouldaccept his visit as a pleasure and a privilege and on this accounthe found it to be very hard to say unpleasant words to them</s>  but theunpleasant words must be spoken</s>  neither in duty nor in kindnesscould he know what he had learned last night and be silent on thismatter to the young mans family</s>  he entered the house and turnedinto the large kitchen or keepingroom on the left in which thetwo women were almost always to be found</s>  this was a spacioussquare low apartment in which there was a long grate withvarious appurtenances for boiling roasting and baking</s>  it was anoldfashioned apparatus but mrs</s>  brattle thought it to be infinitelymore commodious than any of the newerfangled ranges which from timeto time she had been taken to see</s>  opposite to the fireplace therewas a small piece of carpet without which the stone floor wouldhardly have looked warm and comfortable</s>  on the outer corner of thishalf facing the fire and half on one side of it was an old oakarmchair made of oak throughout but with a wellworn cushion onthe seat of it in which it was the millers custom to sit when thework of the day was done</s>  in this chair no one else would ever situnless sam would do so occasionally in bravado and as a protestagainst his fathers authority</s>  when he did so his mother would bewretched and his sister lately had begged him to desist from thesacrilege</s>  close to this was a little round deal table on whichwould be set the millers single glass of gin and water which wouldbe made to last out the process of his evening smoking and thecandle by the light of which and with the aid of a huge pair oftortoiseshell spectacles his wife would sit and darn her husbandsstockings</s>  she also had her own peculiar chair in this corner butshe had never accustomed herself to the luxury of arms to lean onand had no cushion for her own comfort</s>  there were various dresserstables and sideboards round the room and a multiplicity of dishesplates and bowls all standing in their proper places</s>  but thoughthe apartment was called a kitchenand in truth the cookery forthe family was done herethere was behind it opening out to therear another kitchen in which there was a great boiler and a hugeoven never now used</s>  the necessary but unsightly doings of kitchenlife were here carried on out of view</s>  he indeed would have beenfastidious who would have hesitated on any score of cleanliness orniceness to sit and eat at the long board on which the millersdinner was daily served or would have found it amiss to sit at thatfire and listen to the ticking of the great mahoganycased clockwhich stood in the corner of the room</s>  on the other side of the broadopening passage mrs</s>  brattle had her parlour</s>  doubtless this parlouradded something to the few joys of her life though how it did soor why she should have rejoiced in it it would be very difficultto say</s>  she never entered it except for the purpose of cleaning anddusting</s>  but it may be presumed that it was a glory to her to have aroom carpeted with six horsehair chairs and a round table and ahorsehair sofa and an old mirror over the fireplace and a piece ofworstedwork done by her daughter and framed like a picture hangingup on one of the walls</s>  but there must have come from it we shouldsay more of regret than of pleasure for when that room was firstfurnished under her own auspices and when those horsehair chairswere bought with a portion of her own modest dowry doubtless she hadintended that these luxuries should be used by her and hers</s>  but theynever had been so used</s>  the day for using them had never come</s>  herhusband never by any chance entered the apartment</s>  to him probablyeven in his youth it had been a womans gewgaw useless butallowable as tending to her happiness</s>  now the door was never evenopened before his eye</s>  his last interview with carry had been inthat roomwhen he had laid his curse upon her and bade her begonebefore his return so that his decent threshold should be no longerpolluted by her vileness</s> on this side of the house there was a cross passage dividing thefront rooms from the back</s>  at the end of this looking to the frontso as to have the parlour between it and the housedoor was thechamber in which slept brattle and his wife</s>  here all those childrenhad been born who had brought upon the household so many joys and somuch sorrow</s>  and behind looking to the back on to the little plot ofvegetables which was called the gardena plot in which it seemedthat cabbages and gooseberry bushes were made to alternatetherewas a large storeroom and the chamber in which fanny sleptnowalone but which she had once shared with four sisters</s>  carry was thelast one that had left her and now fanny hardly dared to name theword sister above her breath</s>  she could speak indeed of sister jaythe wife of the prosperous

 gilmore at thevicarage</s>  he was at church and walked with the two ladies from theporch to their garden gate but he declined mrs</s>  fenwicks invitationto lunch and was not seen again on that day</s>  the parson had sentword to fanny brattle during the service to stop a few minutes forhim and had learned from her that sam had not been at home lastnight</s>  he had also learned before the service that morning thatvery early on the saturday probably about four oclock two menhad passed through pauls hinton with a huxters cart and a pony</s> now pauls hinton or hinton saint pauls as it should be properlycalled was a long straggling village six miles from bullhamptonand halfway on the road to market lavington to which latter placesam had told his sister that he was going</s>  putting these thingstogether mr</s>  fenwick did not in the least doubt but the two men inthe cart were they who had been introduced to his garden by youngbrattle</s> i only hope said the parson that theres a good surgeon atmarket lavington</s>  one of the gentlemen in that cart must have wantedhim i take it</s>  then he thought that it might perhaps be worth hiswhile to trot over to lavington in the

fenwick had made up his mind that mary was to be hisnearest neighbour for life and had fallen into the way of treatingher accordingly telling her of things in the parish as he might havedone to the squires wife presuming the squires wife to have beenon the best possible terms with him</s>  he now regarded mary as beingalmost an impostor</s>  she had taken him in and obtained his confidenceunder false pretences</s>  it was true that she might still come andfill the place that he had appointed for her</s>  he rather thoughtthat at last she would do so</s>  but he was angry with her because

mrs</s>  fenwick wasnot quite so hard in her judgment but she also was tempted to be alittle angry</s>  she loved her friend mary a great deal better than sheloved mr</s>  gilmore but she was thoroughly convinced that mary couldnot do better than accept a man whom she owned that she likedwhomshe at any rate liked so well that she had not as yet rejected him</s> therefore although mary was going they were both of them rathersavage with her</s> the monday passed by also very quietly and mr</s>  gilmore did not cometo them but he had sent a note to tell them that he would walk downon the

onthe tuesday morning she was very melancholy</s>  though she knew that itwas right to go away she greatly regretted that it was necessary</s> she was angry with herself for not having better known

 i do believeshe said to herself that i shall never like any man better</s>  sheknew well enough that if she was never brought to love any man shenever ought to marry any man but she was not quite sure whetherjanet was not right in telling her that she had formed erroneousnotions of the sort of love she ought to feel for the man whom sheshould resolve to accept</s>  perhaps it was true that that kind ofadoration which janet entertained for her husband was a feeling whichcame after marriagea feeling which would spring up in her own heartas soon as she was the mans own wife the mistress of his house themother of his children the one human being for whose welfare he wassolicitous beyond that of all others</s>  and this man did love her</s>  shehad no doubt about that</s>  and she was unhappy too because she feltthat she had offended his friends and that they thought that she wasnot treating their friend well</s> janet she said as they were again sitting out on the lawn onthat

at the bottom to look at the spot from which she hadtumbled into the river</s>  what a trouble she had been to them all</s>  shewas thoroughly dissatisfied with herself especially so because shehad fallen into those very difficulties which from early years shehad resolved that she would avoid</s>  she had made up her mind that shewould not flirt that she would never give a right to any manor

monuments or thebeautiful old ivycovered tower or thinking of the dead that werelying there or of the living who prayed there but swearing toherself that for the rest of her life she would keep clear of whatshe called girlish messes</s>  like other young ladies she had read muchpoetry and many novels but her sympathies had never been with youngladies who could not go straight through with their

her passion she knewherself and what she was about and loved her lover right heartily</s> of all girls in prose or poetry she declared that rosalind wasthe least of a flirt</s>  she meant to have the

almost if notquite perfect</s>  and yet i am glad to be at home</s> chapter x</s> crunchem cant be had</s> mr</s>  fenwick had intended to have come home round by market lavingtonafter having deposited miss lowther at the westbury station withthe view of making some inquiry respecting the gentleman with thehurt shoulder but he had found the distance to be too great andhad abandoned the idea</s>  after that there was not a day to spare tillthe middle of the next week so that it was nearly a fortnight afterthe little scene at the corner of the vicarage garden wall before hecalled upon the lavington constable and the lavington doctor</s>  fromthe latter he could learn nothing</s>  no such patient had been to him</s> but the constable though he had not seen the two men had heardof them</s>  one was a man who in former days had frequented lavingtonburrows by name generally known as jack the grinder who had beenin every prison in wiltshire and somersetshire but who had notsosaid the constablehonoured lavington for the last two years tillthis his last appearance</s>  he had however been seen there in companywith another man and had evidently been in a condition very unfitfor work</s>  he had slept one night at a low publichouse and had thenmoved on</s>  the man had complained of a fall from the cart and haddeclared that he was black and blue all over but it seemed to beclear that he had no broken bones</s>  mr</s>  fenwick therefore was all butconvinced that jack the grinder was the gentleman with whom he hadhad the encounter and that the grinders back had withstood thatswinging blow from the lifepreserver</s>  of the grinders companionsnothing could be learned</s>  the two men had taken the devizes roadout of lavington and beyond that nothing was known of them</s>  whenthe parson mentioned sam brattles name in a whisper the lavingtonconstable shook his head</s>  he knew all about old jacob brattle</s>  a veryrespectable party was old mr</s>  brattle in the constables opinion</s> nevertheless the constable shook his head when sam brattles name wasmentioned</s>  having learned so much the parson rode home</s> two days after this on a friday fenwick was sitting after breakfastin his study at work on his sermon for next sunday when he was toldthat old mrs</s>  brattle was waiting to see him</s>  he immediately got upand found his own wife and the millers seated in the hall</s>  it wasnot often that mrs</s>  brattle made her way to the vicarage but whenshe did so she was treated with great consideration</s>  it was stillaugust and the weather was very hot and she had walked up acrossthe water mead and was tired</s>  a glass of wine and a biscuit werepressed upon her and she was encouraged to sit and say a fewindifferent words before she was taken into the study and told tocommence the story which had brought her so far</s>  and there was amost inviting topic for conversation</s>  the mill and the mill premiseswere to be put in order by the landlord</s>  mrs</s>  brattle affected tobe rather dismayed than otherwise by the coming operations</s>  themill would have lasted their time she thought and as for them aswere to come after themwell</s>  she didnt know</s>  as things was nowperhaps it might be that after all sam would have the mill</s>  but thetrouble occasioned by the workmen would be infinite</s>  how were they tolive in the mean time and where were they to go</s>  it soon appearedhowever that all this had been already arranged</s>  milling must ofcourse be stopped for a month or six weeks</s>  indeed sir feythersays that there wont be no more grinding much before winter</s> but the mill was to be repaired first and then when it becameabsolutely necessary to dismantle the house they were to endeavourto make shift and live in the big room of the mill itself tilltheir furniture should be put back again</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick with readygood nature offered to accommodate mrs</s>  brattle and fanny at thevicarage but the old woman declined with many protestations ofgratitude</s>  she had never left her old man yet and would not do sonow</s>  the weather would be mild for awhile and she thought that theycould get through</s>  by this time the glass of wine had been sippedto the bottom and the parson mindful of his sermon had led thevisitor into his study</s>  she had come to tell that sam at last hadreturned home</s> why didnt you bring him up with you mrs</s>  brattle</s>  here was aquestion to ask of an old lady whose dominion over her son wasabsolutely none</s>  sam had become so frightfully independent that hehardly regarded the word of his father who was a man preeminentlycapable of maintaining authority and would no more do a thingbecause his mother told him than because the wind whistled</s> i axed him to come up not just with me but of hisself mr</s> fenwick but he said as how you would know where to find him if youwanted him</s> thats just what i dont know</s>  however if hes there now ill go tohim</s>  it would have been better far that he should have come to me</s> i told un so mr</s>  fenwick i did indeed</s> it does not signify</s>  i will go to him only it cannot be today asi have promised to take my wife over to charlicoats</s>  but ill comedown immediately after breakfast tomorrow</s>  you think hell be stillthere</s> i be sure he will mr</s>  fenwick</s>  he and feyther have taken on againtill its beautiful to see</s>  there was none of em feyther ever lovedlike heonly one</s>  thereupon the poor woman burst out into tearsand covered her face with her handkerchief</s>  he never makes half somuch account of my fan that never had a fault belonging to her</s> if sam will stick to that it will be well for him</s> hes taken up extraordinary with the repairs mr</s>  fenwick</s>  hes inand about and over the place looking to everything and feyther sayshe knows so much about it he blieves the boy could do it all out ohis own head</s>  theres nothing feyther ever liked so much as folks tobe strong and clever</s> perhaps the squires tradesmen wont like all that</s>  is mitchellgoing to do it</s> it aint a doing in that way mr</s>  fenwick</s>  the squire is allowing200 and feyther is to get it done</s>  mister mitchell is to see thatits done proper no doubt</s> and now tell me mrs</s>  brattle what has sam been about all the timethat he was away</s> thats just what i cannot tell you mr</s>  fenwick</s> your husband has asked him i suppose</s> if he has he aint told me mr</s>  fenwick</s>  i dont care to comebetween them with hints and jealousies suspecting like</s>  our fan sayshes been out working somewhere lavington way but i dont know asshe knows</s> was he decent looking when he came home</s> he wasnt much amiss mr</s>  fenwick</s>  he has that way with him that hemost always looks decentdont he sir</s> had he any money</s> he had a someat because when he was working moving the big lumberas though for bare life he sent one of the boys for beer and iseed him give the boy the money</s> im sorry for it</s>  i wish hed come back without a penny and withhunger like a wolf in his stomach and with his clothes all ragsso that he might have had a taste of the suffering of a vagabondslife</s> just like the prodigal son mr</s>  fenwick</s> just like the prodigal son</s>  he would not have come back to hisfather had he not been driven by his own vices to live with theswine</s>  then seeing the tears coming down the poor mothers cheekshe added in a kinder voice perhaps it may be all well as it is</s>  wewill hope so at least and tomorrow i will come down and see him</s> you need not tell him that i am coming unless he should ask whereyou have been</s>  then mrs</s>  brattle took her leave and the parsonfinished his sermon</s> that afternoon he drove his wife across the county to visit certainfriends at charlicoats and both going and coming could not keephimself from talking about the brattles</s>  in the first place hethought that gilmore was wrong not to complete the work himself</s> of course hell see that the money is spent and all that and nodoubt in this way he may get the job done twenty or thirty poundscheaper but the brattles have not interest enough in the place tojustify it</s> i suppose the old man liked it best so</s> the old man shouldnt have been allowed to have his way</s>  i am in anawful state of alarm about sam</s>  much as i like himor at any ratedid like himi fear he is going or perhaps has gone to the dogs</s> that those two men were housebreakers is as certain as that you sitthere and i cannot doubt but that he has been with them over atlavington or devizes or somewhere in that country</s> but he may perhaps never have joined them in anything of thatkind</s> a man is known by his companions</s>  i would not have believed it ifi had not found him with the men and traced him and them about thecounty together</s>  you see that this fellow whom they call the grinderwas certainly the man i struck</s>  i tracked him to lavington and therehe was complaining of being sore all over his body</s>  i dont wonderthat he was sore</s>  he must be made like a horse to be no worse thansore</s>  well then that man and sam were certainly in our gardentogether</s> give him a chance frank</s> of course i will give him a chance</s>  i will give him the very bestchance i can</s>  i would do anything to save himbut i cant helpknowing what i know</s> he had made very little to his wife of the danger of the vicaragebeing robbed but he could not but feel that there was danger</s> his wife had brought with her among other plenishing for theirhousehold a considerable amount of handsome plate more than isperhaps generally to be found in country parsonages and no doubtthis fact was known at any rate to sam brattle</s>  had the men simplyintended to rob the garden they would not have run the risk ofcoming so near to the house windows</s>  but then it certainly was truethat sam was not showing them the way</s>  the parson did not quite knowwhat to think about it but it was clearly his duty to be on hisguard</s> that same evening he sauntered across the corner of the churchyardto his neighbour the farmer</s>  looking out warily for bonem he stoodleaning upon the farm gate</s>  bonem was not to be seen or heard andtherefore he entered and walked up to the back door which indeedwas the only door for entrance or egress that was ever used</s>  therewas a front door opening into a little ragged garden but this was asmuch a fixture as the wall</s>  as he was knocking at the back door itwas opened by the farmer himself</s>  mr</s>  fenwick had called to inquirewhether his friend had secured for himas half promisedthepossession of a certain brother of bonems who was supposed to beof a very pugnacious disposition in the silent watches of the night</s> its no go parson</s> why not mr</s>  trumbull</s> the truth is there be such a deal of talk o thieves about thecountry that no one likes to part with such a friend as that</s>  mustercrickly over at imber he have another big dog its true a reglarmastiff but he do say that crunchem be better than the mastiff andhe wont let un go parsonnot for love nor money</s>  i wouldnt letbonem go i know not for nothing</s>  then mr</s>  fenwick walked back tothe vicarage and was half induced to think that as crunchem was notto be had it would be his duty to sit up at night and look afterthe plate box himself</s> chapter xi</s> dont you be afeard about me</s> on the following morning mr</s>  fenwick walked down to the mill</s>  therewas a path all along the river and this was the way he took</s>  hepassed different points as he went and he thought of the trout hehad caught there or had wished to catch and he thought also howoften sam brattle had been with him as he had stood there delicatelythrowing his fly</s>  in those days sam had been very fond of him hadthought it to be a great thing to be allowed to fish with the parsonand had been reasonably obedient</s>  now sam would not even come up tothe vicarage when he was asked to do so</s>  for more than a year afterthe close of those amicable relations the parson had behaved withkindness and almost with affection to the lad</s>  he had interceded withthe squire when sam was accused of poachinghad interceded withthe old miller when sam had given offence at homeand had eveninterceded with the constable when there was a rumour in the windof offences something worse than these</s>  then had come the occasionon which mr</s>  fenwick had told the father that unless the son wouldchange his course evil would come of it and both father and son hadtaken this amiss</s>  the father had told the parson to his face that hethe parson had led his son astray and the son in his revenge hadbrought housebreakers down upon his old friends premises</s> one hasnt to do it for thanks said mr</s>  fenwick as he became alittle bitter while thinking of all this</s>  ill stick to him as longas i can if its only for the old womans sakeand for the poorgirl whom we used to love</s>  then he thought of a clear sweet youngvoice that used to be so well known in his village choir and of theheavy curls which it was a delight to him to see</s>  it had been apleasure to him to have such a girl as carry brattle in his churchand now carry brattle was gone utterly and would probably never beseen in a church again</s>  these brattles had suffered much and hewould bear with them let the task of doing so be ever so hard</s> the sound of workmen was to be already heard as he drew near tothe mill</s>  there were men there pulling the thatch off the buildingand there were carts and horses bringing laths lime bricks andtimber and taking the old rubbish away</s>  as he crossed quickly bythe slippery stones he saw old jacob brattle standing before themill looking on with his hands in his breeches pockets</s>  he wastoo old to do much at such work as thiswork to which he was notaccustomedand was looking up in a sad melancholy way as though itwere a work of destruction and not one of reparation</s> we shall have you here as smart as possible before long mr</s> brattle said the parson</s> i dont know much about smart muster fenwick</s>  the old place wasamost tumbling downbut still it would have lasted out my timeim thinking</s>  if t squire would a done it fifteen years ago ida thanked un but i dont know what to say about it now and thistime of year and all just when the new grist would be coming in</s> if t squire would a thought of it in june now</s>  but things iscontraryamost allays so</s>  after this speech which was made in alow droning voice bit by bit the miller took himself off and wentinto the house</s> at the back of the mill perched on an old projecting beam in themidst of dust and dirt assisting with all the energy of youth in thedemolition of the roof mr</s>  fenwick saw sam brattle</s>  he perceived atonce that sam had seen him but the young man immediately averted hiseyes and went on with his work</s>  the parson did not speak at once butstepped over the ruins around him till he came immediately under thebeam in question</s>  then he called to the lad and sam was constrainedto answer yes mr</s>  fenwick i am herehard at work as you see</s> i do see it and wish you luck with your job</s>  spare me ten minutesand come down and speak to me</s> i am in such a muck now mr</s>  fenwick that i do wish to go on withit if youll let me</s> but mr</s>  fenwick having taken so much trouble to get at the youngman was not going to be put off in this way</s>  never mind your muckfor a quarter of an hour he said</s>  i have come here on purpose tofind you and i must speak to you</s> must</s>  said sam looking down with a very angry lower on his face</s> yesmust</s>  dont be a fool now</s>  you know that i do not wish toinjure you</s>  you are not such a coward as to be afraid to speak to me</s> come down</s> afeard</s>  who talks of being afeard</s>  stop a moment mr</s>  fenwick andill be with younot that i think it will do any good</s>  then slowlyhe crept back along the beam and came down through the interior ofthe building</s>  what is it mr</s>  fenwick</s>  here i am</s>  i aint a bitafeard of you at any rate</s> where have you been the last fortnight sam</s> what right have you to ask me mr</s>  fenwick</s> i have the right of old friendship and perhaps also some right frommy remembrance of the last place in which i saw you</s>  what has becomeof that man burrows</s> what burrows</s> jack the grinder whom i hit on the back the night i made youprisoner</s>  do you think that you were doing well in being in my gardenabout midnight in company with such a fellow as thatone of themost notorious jailbirds in the county</s>  do you know that i could havehad you arrested and sent to prison at once</s> i know you couldntdo nothing of the kind</s> you know this samthat ive no wish to do it that nothing wouldgive me more pain than doing it</s>  but you must feel that if we shouldhear now of any depredation about the county we couldnti atleast could nothelp thinking of you</s>  and i am told that there willbe depredations sam</s>  are you concerned in these matters</s> no i am not said sam doggedly</s> are you disposed to tell me why you were in my garden and why thosemen were with you</s> we were down in the churchyard and the gate was open and so wewalked upthat was all</s>  if wed meant to do anything out of the waywe shouldnt a come like that nor yet at that hour</s>  why it worntmidnight mr</s>  fenwick</s> but why was there such a man as burrows with you</s>  do you think hewas fit company for you sam</s> i suppose a chap may choose his own company mr</s>  fenwick</s> yes he may and go to the gallows because he chooses it as you aredoing</s> very well if thats all youve got to say to me ill go back to mywork</s> stop one moment sam</s>  that is not quite all</s>  i caught you the othernight where you had no business to be and for the sake of yourfather and mother and for old recollections i let you go</s>  perhaps iwas wrong but i dont mean to hark back upon that again</s> you are aharking back on it ever so often</s> i shall take no further steps about it</s> there aint no steps to be taken mr</s>  fenwick</s> but i see that you intend to defy me and therefore i am bound totell you that i shall keep my eye upon you</s> dont you be afeard about me mr</s>  fenwick</s> and if i hear of those fellows burrows and the other being aboutthe place any more i shall give the police notice that they areassociates of yours</s>  i dont think so badly of you yet sam as tobelieve you would bring your fathers grey hairs with sorrow to thegrave by turning thief and housebreaker but when i hear of yourbeing away from home and nobody knowing where you are and findthat you are living without decent employment and prowling about atnights with robbers and cutthroats i cannot but be afraid</s>  do youknow that the squire recognised you that night as well as i</s> the squire aint nothing to me and if youve done with me nowmr</s>  fenwick ill go back to my work</s>  so saying sam brattle againmounted up to the roof and the parson returned discomfited to thefront of the building</s>  he had not intended to see any of the familybut as he was crossing the little bridge meaning to go home roundby the privets he was stopped by fanny brattle</s> i hope it will be all right now mr</s>  fenwick the girl said</s> illustration i hope it will be all right now mr</s>  fenwickthe girl said</s> i hope so too fanny</s>  but you and your mother should keep an eyeon him so that he may know that his goings and comings are noticed</s> i dare say it will be all right as long as the excitement of thesechanges is going on but there is nothing so bad as that he should bein and out of the house at nights and not feel that his absence isnoticed</s>  it will be better always to ask him though he be ever socross</s>  tell your mother i say so</s> chapter xii</s> bonem and his master</s> after leaving the mill mr</s>  fenwick went up to the squire and incontradiction as it were of all the hard things that he had saidto sam brattle spoke to the millers landlord in the lads favour</s> he was hard at work now at any rate and seemed inclined to stickto his work</s>  and there had been an independence about him which theparson had half liked even while he had been offended at it</s>  gilmorediffered altogether from his friend</s>  what was he doing in yourgarden</s>  what was he doing hidden in trumbulls hedge</s>  when i seefellows hiding in ditches at night i dont suppose that theyreafter much good</s>  mr</s>  fenwick made some lame apology even for theseoffences</s>  sam had perhaps not really known the extent of theiniquity of the men with whom he had associated and had come up thegarden probably with a view to the fruit</s>  the matter was discussed atgreat length and the squire at last promised that he would give samanother chance in regard to his own estimation of the young manscharacter</s> on that same eveningor rather after the evening was over for itwas nearly twelve oclock at nightfenwick walked round the gardenand the orchard with his wife</s>  there was no moon now and the nightwas very dark</s>  they stopped for a minute at the wicket leading intothe churchyard and it was evident to them that bonem from thefarmyard at the other side of the church had heard them for hecommenced a low growl with which the parson was by this time wellacquainted</s> good dog good dog said the parson in a low voice</s>  i wish we hadhis brother i know</s> he would only be tearing the maids and biting the children saidmrs</s>  fenwick</s>  i hate having a savage beast about</s> but it would be so nice to catch a burglar and crunch him</s>  i feelalmost bloodthirsty since i hit that fellow with the lifepreserverand find that i didnt kill him</s> i know frank youre thinking about these thieves more than youlike to tell me</s> i was thinking just then that if they were to come and take all thesilver it wouldnt do much harm</s>  we should have to buy german plateand nobody would know the difference</s> suppose they murdered us all</s> they never do that now</s>  the profession is different from what itused to be</s>  they only go where they know they can find a certainamount of spoil and where they can get it without much danger</s>  idont think housebreakers ever cut throats in these days</s>  theyre toofond of their own</s>  then they both agreed that if these rumours ofhousebreakings were continued they would send away the plate someday to be locked up in safe keeping at salisbury</s>  after that theywent to bed</s> on the next morning the sunday morning at a few minutes beforeseven the parson was awakened by his groom at his bedroom door</s> what is it roger</s>  he asked</s> for the love of god sir get up</s>  theyve been and murdered mr</s> trumbull</s> mrs</s>  fenwick who heard the tidings screamed and mr</s>  fenwick wasout of bed and into his trousers in half a minute</s>  in another halfminute mrs</s>  fenwick clothed in her dressinggown was upstairsamong her children</s>  no doubt she thought that as soon as the poorfarmer had been despatched the murderers would naturally pass oninto her nursery</s>  mr</s>  fenwick did not believe the tidings</s>  if a manbe hurt in the huntingfield it is always said that hes killed</s> if the kitchen flue be on fire it is always said that the house isburned down</s>  something however had probably happened at farmertrumbulls and down went the parson across the garden and orchardand through the churchyard as quick as his legs would carry him</s> in the farmyard he found quite a crowd of men including the twoconstables and three or four of the leading tradesmen in the village</s> the first thing that he saw was the dead body of bonem the dog</s>  hewas stiff and stark and had been poisoned</s> hows mr</s>  trumbull</s>  he asked of the nearest bystander</s> laws parson aint ye heard</s>  said the man</s>  theyve knocked hisskull open with a hammer and hes as deadas dead</s> hearing this the parson turned round and made his way into thehouse</s>  there was not a doubt about it</s>  the farmer had been murderedduring the night and his money carried off</s>  upstairs mr</s>  fenwickmade his way to the farmers bedroom and there lay the body</s>  mr</s> crittenden the village doctor was there and a crowd of men andan old woman or two</s>  among the women was trumbulls sister the wifeof a neighbouring farmer who with her husband a tenant of mr</s> gilmores had come over just before the arrival of mr</s>  fenwick</s> the body had been found on the stairs and it was quite clear thatthe farmer had fought desperately with the man or men before he hadreceived the blow which despatched him</s> i told um how it bei did i did when he would a all that moneyby um</s>  this was the explanation given by mr</s>  trumbulls sistermrs</s>  boddle</s> it seemed that trumbull had had in his possession over a hundredand fifty pounds of which the greater part was in gold and thathe kept this in a moneybox in his bedroom</s>  one of the two womenwho lived in his servicehe himself had been a widower withoutchildrendeclared that she had always known that at night he tookthe box out of his cupboard into bed with him</s>  she had seen it theremore than once when she had taken him up drinks when he was unwell</s> when first interrogated she declared that she did not remember atthat moment that she had ever told anybody she thought she hadnever told anybody at last she would swear that she had neverspoken a word about it to a single soul</s>  she was supposed to be agood girl had come of decent people and was well known by mr</s> fenwick of whose congregation she was one</s>  her name was agnes pope</s> the other servant was an elderly woman who had been in the house allher life but was unfortunately deaf</s>  she had known very well aboutthe money and had always been afraid about it had very often spokento her master about it but never a word to agnes</s>  she had been wokenin the nightthat was as it turned out about 2 a</s> m</s> by thegirl who slept with her and who declared that she had heard a greatnoise as of somebody tumblinga very great noise indeed as thoughthere were ever so many people tumbling</s>  for a long time for perhapsan hour they had lain still being afraid to move</s>  then the elderwoman had lighted a candle and gone down from the garret in whichthey slept</s>  the first thing she saw was the body of her master inhis shirt upon the stairs</s>  she had then called up the only otherhuman being who slept on the premises a shepherd who had lived forthirty years with trumbull</s>  this man had thrown open the house andhad gone for assistance and had found the body of the dead dog inthe yard</s> before nine oclock the facts as they have been told were knowneverywhere and the squire was down on the spot</s>  the manor as itwas presumed menhad entered by the unaccustomed front door whichwas so contrived as to afford the easiest possible mode of gettinginto the house whereas the back door which was used by everybodyhad been bolted and barred with all care</s>  the men must probably haveentered by the churchyard and the back gate of the farmyard as thathad been found to be unlatched whereas the gate leading out on tothe road had been found closed</s>  the farmer himself had always beenvery careful to close both these gates when he let out bonem beforegoing to bed</s>  poor bonem had been enticed to his death by a piece ofpoisoned meat thrown to him probably some considerable time beforethe attack was made</s> who were the murderers</s>  that of course was the first question</s>  itneed hardly be said with how sad a heart mr</s>  fenwick discussed thismatter with the squire</s>  of course inquiry must be made of the mannerin which sam brattle had passed the night</s>  heavens</s>  how would it bewith that poor family if he had been concerned in such an affair asthis</s>  and then there came across the parsons mind a remembrance thatagnes pope and sam brattle had been seen by him together on moresundays than one</s>  in his anxiety and with much imprudence he wentto the girl and questioned her again</s> for your own sake agnes tell me are you sure you never mentionedabout the moneybox tosam brattle</s> the girl blushed and hesitated and then said that she was quite sureshe never had</s>  she didnt think she had ever said ten words to samsince she knew about the box</s> but five words would be sufficient agnes</s> then them five words was never spoke sir said the girl</s>  but stillshe blushed and the parson thought that her manner was not in herfavour</s> it was necessary that the parson should attend to his church but thesquire who was a magistrate went down with the two constables tothe mill</s>  there they found sam and his father with mrs</s>  brattle andfanny</s>  no one went to the church from the mill on that day</s>  the newshad reached them of the murder and they all feltthough no oneof them had so said to any otherthat something might in some wayconnect them with the deed that had been done</s>  sam had hardly spokensince he had heard of mr</s>  trumbulls death though when he saw thathis father was perfectly silent as one struck with some suddendread he bade the old man hold up his head and fear nothing</s>  oldbrattle when so addressed seated himself in his armchair andthere remained without a word till the magistrate with the constableswere among them</s> there were not many at church and mr</s>  fenwick made the service veryshort</s>  he could not preach the sermon which he had prepared but saida few words on the terrible catastrophe which had occurred so nearto them</s>  this man who was now lying within only a few yards of themwith his brains knocked out had been alive among them strong andin good health yesterday evening</s>  and there had come into theirpeaceful village miscreants who had been led on from selfindulgenceto idleness and from idleness to theft and from theft to murder</s>  weall know the kind of words which the parson spoke and the thrill ofattention with which they would be heard</s>  here was a man who had beenclose to them and therefore the murder came home to them all andfilled them with an excitement which alas</s>  was not probably withoutsome feeling of pleasure</s>  but the sermon if sermon it could becalled was very short and when it was over the parson also hurrieddown to the mill</s> it had already been discovered that sam brattle had certainly beenout during the night</s>  he had himself denied this at first sayingthat though he had been the last to go to bed he had gone to bedabout eleven and had not left the millhouse till late in themorningbut his sister had heard him rise and had seen his bodythrough the gloom as he passed beneath the window of the room inwhich she slept</s>  she had not heard him return but when she arose atsix had found out that he was then in the house</s>  he manifested noanger against her when she gave this testimony but acknowledged thathe had been out that he had wandered up to the road and explainedhis former denial franklyor with wellassumed franknessbysaying that he would if possible for his fathers and motherssake have concealed the fact that he had been awayknowing thathis absence would give rise to suspicions which would wellnigh breaktheir hearts</s>  he had not howeverso he saidbeen any nearerto bullhampton than the point of the road opposite to the lodge ofhampton privets from whence the lane turned down to the mill</s>

vehicle</s>  nohe had thoughtof doing so but had not</s>  could he guess who was in the vehicle</s>  bythis time many surmises had been made aloud as to jack the grinderand his companion and it had become generally known that theparson had encountered two such men in his own garden some nightspreviously</s>  sam when he was pressed said that the idea had comeinto his mind that the vehicle was the grinders cart</s>  he had noknowledge he said that the man was coming to bullhampton on thatnightbut the man had said in his hearing that he would like tostrip the parsons peaches</s>  he was asked also about farmer trumbullsmoney</s>  he declared that he had never heard that the farmer kept moneyin the house</s>  he did know that the farmer was accounted to be a verysaving manbut that was

it was so and by this may be seen how little the sir gregory of thepresent day had been able to do for his brother and perhaps it mayalso be imagined from this that the present clergyman at loringlowtown had been able to do very little for himself</s>  neverthelesshe was a kindlyhearted good sincere old mannot very brightindeed nor peculiarly fitted for preaching the gospel but he

disbelieved in this branch of the marrablesaltogether</s>  captain marrable had lived with his father a gooddealat least so she had understoodand therefore could not butbe bad</s>  and moreover our

mary lowther and her cousin had taken their walk together on mondayevening and on the next morning she received the following letterfrom mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  when it reached her she had as yet heard nothingof the bullhampton tragedy</s>  vicarage monday sept</s>  1 186</s>  dearest mary i suppose you will have heard before you get this of the dreadful murder that has taken place here and which has so startled and horrified us that we hardly know what we are doing even yet</s>  it is hard to say why a thing should be worse because it is close but it certainly is so</s>  had it been in the next parish or even further off in this parish i do not think that i should feel it so much and then we knew the old man so well and then againwhich makes it worst of allwe all of us are unable to get rid of a suspicion that one whom we knew and was liked has been a participator in the crime</s>  it seems that it must have been about two oclock on sunday morning that mr</s>  trumbull was killed</s>  it was at any rate between one and three</s>  as far as they can judge they think that there must have been three men concerned</s>  you remember how we used to joke about poor mr</s>  trumbulls dog</s>  well he was poisoned firstprobably an hour before the men got into the house</s>  it has been discovered that the foolish old man kept a large sum of money by him in a box and that he always took this box into bed with him</s>  the woman who lived in the house with him used to see it there</s>  no doubt the thieves had heard of this and both frank and mr</s>  gilmore think that the girl agnes pope whom you will remember in the choir told about it</s>  she lived with mr</s>  trumbull and we all thought her a very good girlthough she was too fond of that young man sam brattle</s>  they think that the men did not mean to do the murder but that the old man fought so hard for his money that they were driven to it</s>  his body was not in the room but on the top of the stairs and his temple had been split open with a blow of a hammer</s>  the hammer lay beside him and was one belonging to the house</s>  mr</s>  gilmore says that there was great craft in their using a weapon which they did not bring with them</s>  of course they cannot be traced by the hammer</s>  they got off with 150 in the box and did not touch anything else</s>  everybody feels quite sure that they knew all about the money and that when mr</s>  gilmore saw them that night down at the churchyard corner they were prowling about with a view of seeing how they could get into the farmers house and not into the vicarage</s>  frank thinks that when he afterwards found them in our place sam brattle had brought them in with a kind of wild idea of taking the fruit but that the men of their own account had come round to reconnoitre the house</s>  they both say that there can be no doubt about the men having been the same</s>  then comes the terrible question whether sam brattle the son of that dear woman at the mill has been one of the murderers</s>  he had been at home all the previous day working very hard at the workswhich are being done in obedience to your orders my dear but he certainly was out on the saturday night</s>  it is very hard to get at any mans belief in such matters but as far as i can understand them i dont think that either frank or mr</s>  gilmore do really believe that he was there</s>  frank says that it will go very hard with him and mr</s>  gilmore has committed him</s>  the magistrates are to sit tomorrow at heytesbury and mr</s>  gilmore will be there</s>  he has as you may be sure behaved as well as possible and has quite altered in his manner to the old people</s>  i was at the mill this morning</s>  brattle himself would not speak to me but i sat for an hour with mrs</s>  brattle and fanny</s>  it makes it almost the more melancholy having all the rubbish and building things about and yet the work stopped</s>  fanny brattle has behaved so well</s>  it was she who told that her brother had been out at night</s>  mr</s>  gilmore says that when the question was asked in his presence she answered it in her own quiet simple way without a moments doubt but since that she has never ceased to assert her conviction that her brother has had nothing to do either with the murder or with the robbery</s>  if it had not been for this mrs</s>  brattle would i think have sunk under the load</s>  fanny says the same thing constantly to her father</s>  he scolds her and bids her hold her tongue but she goes on and i think it has some effect even on him</s>  the whole place does look such a picture of ruin</s>  it would break your heart to see it</s>  and then when one looks at the father and mother one remembers about that other child and is almost tempted to ask why such misery should have fallen upon parents who have been honest sober and industrious</s>  can it really be that the man is being punished here on earth because he will not believe</s>  when i hinted this to frank he turned upon me and scolded me and told me i was measuring the almighty god with a footrule</s>  but men were punished in the bible because they did not believe</s>  remember the baptists father</s>  but i never dare to go on with frank on these matters</s>  i am so full of this affair of poor mr</s>  trumbull and so anxious about sam brattle that i cannot now write about anything else</s>  i can only say that no man ever behaved with greater kindness and propriety than harry gilmore who has had to act as magistrate</s>  poor fanny brattle has to go to heytesbury tomorrow to give her evidence</s>  at first they said that they must take the father also but he is to be spared for the present</s>  i should tell you that sam himself declares that he got to know these men at a place where he was at work brickmaking near devizes</s>  he had quarrelled with his father and had got a job there with high wages</s>  he used to be out at night with them and acknowledges that he joined one of them a man named burrows in stealing a brood of peafowl which some poulterers wanted to buy</s>  he says he looked on it as a joke</s>  then it seems he had some spite against trumbulls dog and that this man burrows came over here on purpose to take the dog away</s>  this according to his story is all that he knows of the man and he says that on that special saturday night he had not the least idea that burrows was at bullhampton till he heard the sound of a certain cart on the road</s>  i tell you all this as i am sure you will share our anxiety respecting this unfortunate young manbecause of his mother and sister</s>  goodbye dearest frank sends ever so many lovesand somebody else would send them too if he thought that i would be the

wasmurdered</s>  as mrs</s>  fenwick had said the truth is so much more realwhen it comes from things that are near</s>  and then she had so oftenheard the character of sam brattle describedthe man who was now inprison as a murderer</s>  and she herself had given lessons in singing toagnes pope who was now in some sort accused of aiding the thieves</s> and she herself had asked agnes whether it was not foolish for her tobe hanging about the farmyard outside her masters premises withsam brattle</s>  it was all brought very near to her</s> before that day was over she was telling the story to captainmarrable</s>  she had of course told it to her aunt and they hadbeen discussing it the whole morning</s>  mr</s>  gilmores name had beenmentioned to captain marrable but very little more than the name</s> aunt sarah however had already begun to think whether it mightnot be prudent to tell cousin walter the story of the halfformedengagement</s>  mary had expressed so much sympathy with her cousinswrongs that aunt sarah had begun to fear that that sympathy mightlead to a tenderer feeling and aunt sarah was by no means anxiousthat her niece should fall in love with a gentleman whose chiefattraction was the fact that he had been ruined by his own fathereven though that gentleman was a marrable himself</s>  this danger mightpossibly be lessened if captain marrable were made acquainted withthe gilmore affair and taught to understand how desirable such amatch would be for mary</s>  but aunt sarah had qualms of conscienceon the subject</s>  she doubted whether she had a right to tell thestory without leave from mary and then there was in truth no realengagement</s>  she knew indeed that mr</s>  gilmore had made the offer morethan once but then she knew also that the offer had at any rate notas yet been accepted and she felt that on mr</s>  gilmores account aswell as on marys she ought to hold her tongue</s>  it might indeed beadmissible to tell to a cousin that which she would not tell to anindifferent young man but nevertheless she could not bring herselfto do even with so good an object that which she believed to bewrong</s> that evening mary was again walking on the towingpath beside theriver with her cousin walter</s>  she had met him now about five timesand there was already an intimacy between them</s>  the idea of cousinlyintimacy to girls is undoubtedly very pleasant and i do not knowwhether it is not the fact that the better and the purer is the girlthe sweeter and the pleasanter is the idea</s>  in america a girl mayform a friendly intimacy with any young man she fancies and thoughshe may not be free from little jests and goodhumoured joking thereis no injury to her from such intimacy</s>  it is her acknowledged rightto enjoy herself after that fashion and to have what she calls agood time with young men</s>  a dozen such intimacies do not stand in herway when there comes some real adorer who means to marry her and isable to do so</s>  she rides with these friends walks with them andcorresponds with them</s>  she goes out to balls and picnics with themand afterwards lets herself in with a latchkey while her papa andmamma are abed and asleep with perfect security</s>  if there be muchto be said against the practice there is also something to be saidfor it</s>  girls on the other hand on the continent of europe do notdream of making friendship with any man</s>  a cousin with them is asmuch out of the question as the most perfect stranger</s>  in strictfamilies a girl is hardly allowed to go out with her brother and ihave heard of mothers who thought it indiscreet that a father shouldbe seen alone with his daughter at a theatre</s>  all friendships betweenthe sexes must under such a social code be looked forward to aspostnuptial joys</s>  here in england there is a something betwixt thetwo</s>  the intercourse between young men and girls is free enough toenable the latter to feel how pleasant it is to be able to forget forawhile conventional restraints and to acknowledge how joyous a thingit is to indulge in social intercourse in which the simple delight ofequal mind meeting equal mind in equal talk is just enhanced by theunconscious remembrance that boys and girls when they meet togethermay learn to love</s>  there is nothing more sweet in youth thanthis nothing more natural nothing more fitting nothing indeedmore essentially necessary for gods purposes with his creatures</s> nevertheless here with us there is the restriction and it isseldom that a girl can allow herself the full

constable of the district askedfor a week more to make fresh inquiry and expressed a very strongopinion that he would have the grinder and his friend by the heelsbefore the week should be over</s>  the heytesbury attorney made afeeble request that sam might be released on bail as there was notaccording to his statement the remotest shadow of a tittle ofevidence against him</s>  but poor sam was

seemed to think that by that time unlessthe grinder were below the sod his presence above it would certainlybe proved</s>  on this occasion the heytesbury attorney made a veryloud demand for sams

 jones made a spirited rejoinder to this but it was of no useand poor sam was sent back to gaol for the third time</s> for the first ten days after the murder nothing was done as to theworks at the mill</s>  the men who had been employed by brattle ceased tocome apparently of their own account and everything was lying therejust in the state in which the men had left the place on the saturdaynight</s>  there was something inexpressibly sad in this as the old mancould not even make a pretence of going into the mill for employmentand there was absolutely nothing to which he could put his hands todo it</s>  when ten days were over gilmore came down to the mill andsuggested that the works should be carried on and finished by him</s>  ifthe mill were not kept at work the old man could not live and norent would be paid</s>  at any rate it would be better that this greatsorrow should not be allowed so to cloud everything as to turnindustry into idleness and straitened

that the property could not be leftin that way he expressed himself willing to go out into the roadand lay himself down and die therebut not until the term of hisholding was legally brought to a close</s>  i dont know that i oweany rent over and beyond this michaelmas as is coming and theresthe hay on the ground yet</s>  gilmore who was very patient assuredhim that he had no wish to allude to

mr</s>  jones the attorney were beginning to say that sambrattle should be let out of prison</s>  mr</s>  fenwick was clearly ofopinion that he should not be detained if bail could be forthcoming</s> the squire was more cautious and said that it might well be that hisescape would render it impossible for the police even to get on thetrack of the real murderers</s>  no doubt he knows more than he

hadnothing to do with the murder</s> i never knew a man change his opinion so often as you do saidgilmore</s> during three weeks the visits made by head constable toffy to thecottage in which mrs</s>  burrows lived were much more frequent thanwere agreeable to that lady</s>  this cottage was about four miles fromdevizes and on the edge of a common about half a mile from thehigh road which leads from that town to marlborough</s>  there is orwas a year or two back a considerable extent of unenclosed landthereabouts and on a spot called pycroft common there was a smallcollection of cottages sufficient to constitute a hamlet of thesmallest class</s>  there was no house there of greater pretensions thanthe very small beershop which provided for the conviviality of thepycroftians and of other shops there was none save a bakers theowner of which seldom had much bread to sell and the establishmentfor brandyballs which was kept by mrs</s>  burrows</s>  the inhabitantswere chiefly labouring men some of whom were in summer employed inbrick making and there was an idea abroad that pycroft generally wasnot sustained by regular labour and sober industry</s>  rents howeverwere paid for the cottages or the cottagers would have been turnedadrift and mrs</s>  burrows had lived in hers for five or six years andwas noted in the neighbourhood for her outward neatness and attentionto decency</s>  in the summer there were always halfadozen largesunflowers in the patch of ground called a garden and there was arosetree and a bush of honeysuckle over the door and an alderstump in a corner which would still put out leaves and bear berries</s> when head constable toffy visited her there would be generally a fewhigh words for mrs</s>  burrows was by no means unwilling to let it

believed by mr</s> toffy to be the wife of richard burrows alias the grinder</s>  on hisfirst visit to pycroft no doubt mr</s>  toffy was mainly anxious toascertain whether anything was known by the old woman as to her sonswhereabouts but the second third and fourth visits were maderather to the younger than to the older woman</s>  toffy had probablylearned in his wide experience that a man of the grinders naturewill generally place more reliance on a young woman than on an oldand that the young woman will nevertheless be more likely to betrayconfidence than the olderpartly from indiscretion and partlyalas</s>  from treachery</s>  but if the presumed mrs</s>  burrows junior knewaught of the grinders present doings she was neither indiscreet nortreacherous</s>  mr</s>  toffy

marrable that a portion of his inheritancewould be saved for him or had that graceless father of his in verytruth seized upon it all</s>  there was no shadow of doubt but that ifaught was spared it had not been spared through any delicacy on thepart of the colonel</s>  the colonel had gone to work paying creditorswho were clamorous against him the moment he had got his handupon the money and had gone to work also gambling and had madeassignments of money and done his very best to spend the whole</s>  butthere was a question whether a certain sum of 5000 which seemedto have got into the hands of a certain lady who protested that shewanted it very badly might not be saved</s>  messrs</s>  block and curlingthought that it might but were by no means certain</s>  it probablymight be done if the captain would consent to bring the matterbefore a jury in which case the whole story of the fathers iniquitymust of course be proved</s>  or it might be that by threatening todo this the ladys friends would relax their grasp on receiving acertain present out of the money</s> we would offer them 50 and perhaps they would take 500 saidmessrs</s>  block and curling</s> all this irritated the captain</s>  he was intensely averse to any lawproceedings by which the story should be made public</s> i wont pretend that it is on my fathers account said he tohis uncle</s>  parson john shrugged his shoulders and shook his headmeaning to imply that it certainly was a bad case but that ascolonel marrable was a marrable he ought to be spared if possible</s> it is on my own account continued the captain and partlyperhaps on that of the family</s>  i would endure anything rather thanhave the filth of the transaction flooded through the newspapers</s>  ishould never be able to join my mess again if i did that</s> then youd better let block and curling compromise and get what theycan said parson john with an indifferent and provoking tone whichclearly indicated that he would regard the matter when so settled asone arranged amicably and pleasantly between all the parties</s>  hisuncles calmness and absence of horror at the thing that had beendone was very grievous to captain marrable</s> poor wat</s>  the parson had once said speaking of his wicked brotherhe never could keep two shillings together</s>  its ever so long sincei had to determine that nothing on earth should induce me to let himhave halfacrown</s>  i must say that he did not take it amiss when itold him</s> why should he have wanted halfacrown from you</s> he was always one of those thirsty sandbags that swallow small dropsand large alike</s>  he got 10000 out of poor gregory about the timethat you were born and gregory is fretting about it yet</s> what kills me is the disgrace of it said the young man</s> it would be disagreeable to have it in the newspapers said parsonjohn</s>  and then he was such a pleasant fellow and so handsome</s>  ialways enjoyed his society when once i had buttoned up my breechespocket</s> yet this man was a clergyman preaching honesty and moral conductand living fairly well up to his preaching too as far as he himselfwas concerned</s>  the captain almost thought that the earth and skiesshould be brought together and the clouds clap with thunder andthe mountains be riven in twain at the very mention of his fatherswickedness</s>  but then sins committed against oneself are so much moresinful than any other sins</s> the captain had much more sympathetic listeners in uphill lane notthat either of the ladies there spoke severely against his fatherbut that they entered more cordially into his own distresses</s>  if hecould save even 4500 out of the wreck the interest on the moneywould enable him to live at home in his regiment</s>  if he could get4000 he would do it</s> with 150 per annum he said i could just hold my head up and getalong</s>  i should have to give up all manner of things but i wouldnever cry about that</s> then again he would declare that the one thing necessary for hishappiness was that he should get the whole business of the money offhis mind</s>  if i could have it settled and have done with it saidhe i should be at ease</s> quite right my dear said the old lady</s>  my idea about money isthis that whether you have much or little you should make yourarrangements so that it be no matter of thought to you</s>  your moneyshould be just like counters at a round game with children andshould mean nothing</s>  it comes to that when you once get things on aproper footing</s> they thus became very intimate the two ladies in uphill lane and thecaptain from his uncles parsonage in the lowtown and the intimacyon his part was quite as strong with the younger as with the elderrelativequite as strong and no doubt more pleasant</s>  they walkedtogether constantly as cousins may walk and they discussed everyturn that took place in the correspondence with messrs</s>  block andcurling</s>  captain marrable had come to his uncles house for a week orten days but had been pressed to remain on till this business shouldbe concluded</s>  his leave of absence lasted till the end of novemberand might be prolonged if he intended to return to india</s>  stay heretill the end of november said parson john</s>  whats the use ofspending your money at a london hotel</s>  only dont fall in love withcousin mary</s>  so the captain did stay obeying one half of hisuncles advice and promising obedience to the other half</s> aunt sarah also had her fears about the falling in love and spoke aprudent word to mary</s>  mary dear she said you and walter are asloving as turtle doves</s> i do like him so much said mary boldly</s> so do i my dear</s>  he is a gentleman and clever and upon thewhole he bears a great injury well</s>  i like him</s>  but i dont thinkpeople ought to fall in love when there is a strong reason againstit</s> certainly not if they can help it</s> pshaw</s>  thats missish nonsense mary and you know it</s>  if a girlwere to tell me she fell in love because she couldnt help it ishould tell her that she wasnt worth any mans love</s> but whats your reason aunt sarah</s> because it wouldnt suit mr</s>  gilmore</s> i am not bound to suit mr</s>  gilmore</s> i dont know about that</s>  and then too it would not suit walterhimself</s>  how could he marry a wife when he has just been robbed ofall his fortune</s> but i have not the slightest idea of falling in love with him</s>  inspite of what i said i do hope that i can help it</s>  and then i feelto him just as though he were my brother</s>  ive got almost to knowwhat it would be to have a brother</s> in this miss lowther was probably wrong</s>  she had now known hercousin for just a month</s>  a month is quite long enough to realise thepleasure of a new lover but it may be doubted whether the intimacyof a brother does not take a very much longer period for itscreation</s> i think if i were you said miss marrable after a pause that iwould tell him about mr</s>  gilmore</s> would you aunt sarah</s> i think i would</s>  if he were really your brother you would tell him</s> it was probably the case that when miss marrable gave thisadvice her opinion of mr</s>  gilmores success was greater than thecircumstances warranted</s>  though there had been much said between theaunt and her niece about mr</s>  gilmore and his offers mary had neverbeen able quite to explain her own thoughts and feelings</s>  she herselfdid not believe that she could be brought to accept him and wasnow stronger in that opinion than ever</s>  but were she to say so inlanguage that would convince her aunt her aunt would no doubt askher why then had she left the man in doubt</s>  though she knew thatat every moment in which she had been called upon to act she hadstruggled to do right yet there hung over her a halfconviction thatshe had been weak and almost selfish</s>  her dearest friends wrote toher and spoke to her as though she would certainly take mr</s>  gilmoreat last</s>  janet fenwick wrote of it in her letters as of a thingalmost fixed and aunt sarah certainly lived as though she expectedit</s>  and yet mary was very nearly sure that it could not be so</s>  wouldit not be better that she should write to mr</s>  gilmore at onceand not wait till the expiration of the weary six months which hehad specified as the time at the end of which he might renew hisproposals</s>  had aunt sarah known all thishad she been aware howvery near mary was to the writing of such a lettershe wouldnot probably have suggested that her niece should tell her cousinanything about mr</s>  gilmore</s>  she did think that the telling of thetale would make cousin walter understand that he should not allowhimself to become an interloper but the tale if told as mary wouldtell it might have a very different effect</s> nevertheless mary thought that she would tell it</s>  it would be so niceto consult a brother</s>  it would be so pleasant to discuss the matterwith some one that would sympathise with herwith some one whowould not wish to drive her into mr</s>  gilmores arms simply becausemr</s>  gilmore was an excellent gentleman with a snug property</s>  evenfrom janet fenwick whom she loved dearly she had never succeededin getting the sort of sympathy that she wanted</s>  janet was the bestfriend in the worldwas actuated in this matter simply by a desireto do a good turn to two people whom she loved</s>  but there was nosympathy between her and mary in the matter</s> marry him said janet and you will adore him afterwards</s> i want to adore him first said mary</s> so she resolved that she would tell walter marrable what was herposition</s>  they were again down on the banks of the lurwell sittingtogether on a slope which had been made to support some hundred yardsof a canal where the river itself rippled down a slightly rapidfall</s>  they were seated between the canal and the river with theirfeet towards the latter and walter marrable was just lighting acigar</s>  it was very easy to bring the conversation round to theaffairs of bullhampton as sam was still in prison and janetsletters were full of the mystery which shrouded the murder of mr</s> trumbull</s> by the bye said she i have something to tell you about mr</s> gilmore</s> tell away said he as he turned the cigar round in his mouth tocomplete the lighting of the edges in the wind</s> ah but i shant unless you will interest yourself</s>  what i am goingto tell you ought to interest you</s> he has made you a proposal of marriage</s> yes</s> i knew it</s> how could you know it</s>  nobody has told you</s> i felt sure of it from the way in which you speak of him</s>  but ithought also that you had refused

tell her thatit was time to move that they might return home</s>  he had given herno advice but she presumed she was to take what had passed as theexpression of his opinion that it was her duty to

chapter xvii</s> the marquis of trowbridge</s> by the end of september it had come to be pretty well understood thatsam brattle must be allowed to go out of prison unless somethingin the shape of

not selltheir own hay off the land nor indeed any produce other than theircorn or cattle</s>  they were compelled to crop their land in certainrotation and could take no other lands than those held under themarquis without his leave</s>  in return for all this they became themarquiss people</s>  each tenant shook hands with the marquis perhapsonce in three years and twice a year was allowed to get drunk at themarquiss expenseif such was his tasteprovided that he had paidhis rent</s>  if the duties were heavy the privileges were great</s>  sothe marquis himself felt and he knew that a mantle of security ofa certain thickness was spread upon the shoulders of each of hispeople by reason of the tenure which bound them together</s>  but he didnot conceive that this mantle would be proof against the bullet ofthe ordinary assassin or the hammer of the outside ruffian</s>  but herethe case was very different</s>  the hammer had been the hammer of nooutside ruffian</s>  to the best of his lordships beliefand in thatbelief he was supported by the constabulary of the whole countythehammer had been wielded by a man of bullhamptonhad been wieldedagainst his tenant by the son of a person who holds land under agentleman who has some property in the parish</s>  it was thus themarquis was accustomed to speak of his neighbour mr</s>  gilmore whoin the marquiss eyes was a man not big enough to have his tenantscalled his people</s>  that such a man as sam brattle should havemurdered such a one as mr</s>  trumbull was to the marquis an insultrather than an injury and now it was to be enhanced by the releaseof the man from prison and that by order of a bench of magistrateson which mr</s>  gilmore sat</s> and there was more in it even than all this</s>  it was very well knownat turnover parkthe seat of lord trowbridge near westburythatmr</s>  gilmore the gentleman who held property in his lordships parishof bullhampton and mr</s>  fenwick who was vicar of the same wereanother damon and pythias</s>  now the ladies at turnover who were muchdevoted to the low church had heard and doubtless believed that ourfriend mr</s>  fenwick was little better than an infidel</s>  when firsthe had come into the county they had been very anxious to make himout to be a high churchman and a story or two about a cross anda candlestick were fabricated for their gratification</s>  there wasat that time the remnant of a great fight going on between thetrowbridge people and another great family in the neighbourhood onthis subject and it would have suited the ladies stowtejohnaugustus stowte was the marquis of trowbridgeto have enlisted ourparson among their enemies of this class but the accusation fell soplump to the ground was so impossible of support that they wereobliged to content themselves with knowing that mr</s>  fenwick wasaninfidel</s>  to do the marquis justice we must declare that he wouldnot have troubled himself on this score if mr</s>  fenwick would havesubmitted himself to become one of his people</s>  the marquis was masterat home and the ladies sophie and carolina would have been proud toentertain mr</s>  fenwick by the week together at turnover had he beenwilling infidel or believer to join that faction</s>  but he neverjoined that faction and he was not only the bosom friend of thegentleman who owned some land in the parish but he was twice morerebellious than that gentleman himself</s>  he had contradicted themarquis flat to his faceso the marquis said himselfwhen theymet once about some business in the parish and again when in thevicars early days in bullhampton some gathering for schoolfestivalpurposes was made in the great home field behind farmer trumbullshouse mrs</s>  fenwick misbehaved herself egregiously</s> upon my word she patronised us said lady sophie laughing</s>  shedid indeed</s>  and you know what she was</s>  her father was just a commonbuilder at loring who made some money by a speculation in bricks andmortar</s> when lady sophie said this she was no doubt ignorant of the factthat mr</s>  balfour had been the younger son of a family much moreancient than her own that he had taken a doublefirst at oxfordhad been a member of half the learned societies in europe and hadbelonged to two or three of the best clubs in london</s> from all this it will be seen that the marquis of trowbridge wouldbe disposed to think ill of whatever might be done in regard to themurder by the gilmorefenwick party in the parish</s>  and then therewere tales about for which there was perhaps some foundation thatthe vicar and the murderer had been very dear friends</s>  it wascertainly believed at turnover that the vicar and sam brattle hadfor years past spent the best part of their sundays fishing together</s> there were tales of ratkilling matches in which they had beenengagedoriginating in the undeniable fact of a certain campaignagainst rats at the mill in which the vicar had taken an ardentpart</s>  undoubtedly the destruction of vermin and in regard to onespecies its preservation for the sake of destructionand thecatching of fishand the shooting of birdswere things lovelyin the vicars eyes</s>  he perhaps did let his pastoral dignity goa little by the board when he and sam stooped together each witha ferret in his hand grovelling in the dust to get at certainratadvantages in the mill</s>  gilmore who had seen it had told himof this</s>  i understand it all old fellow fenwick had said to hisfriend and know very well i have got to choose between two things</s> i must be called a hypocrite or else i must be one</s>  i have no doubtthat as years go on with me i shall see the advantage of choosing thelatter</s>  there were at that time frequent discussions between themon the same subject for they were friends who could dare to discusseach others modes of life but the reader need not be troubledfurther now with this digression</s>  the position which the vicar heldin the estimation of the marquis of trowbridge will probably besufficiently well understood</s> the family at turnover park would have thought it a great blessingto have had a clergyman at bullhampton with whom they could havecordially cooperated but failing this they had taken mr</s> puddleham the methodist minister to their arms</s>  from mr</s>  puddlehamthey learned parish facts and parish fables which would never havereached them but for his assistance</s>  mr</s>  fenwick was well aware ofthis and used to declare that he had no objection to it</s>  he wouldprotest that he could not see why mr</s>  puddleham should not get alongin the parish just as well as himself he having and meaning tokeep to himself the slight advantages of the parish church thevicaragehouse and the small tithes</s>  of this he was quite sure thatmr</s>  puddlehams religious teaching was better than none at all andhe was by no means convincedso he saidthat for some of hisparishioners mr</s>  puddleham was not a better teacher than he himself</s> he always shook hands with mr</s>  puddleham though mr</s>  puddlehamwould never look him in the face and was quite determined that mr</s> puddleham should not be a thorn in his side</s> in this matter of sam brattles imprisonment and now intendedliberation tidings from the parish were doubtless conveyed by mr</s> puddleham to turnoverprobably not direct but still in such amanner that the great people at turnover knew to whom they wereindebted</s>  now mr</s>  gilmore had certainly from the first been by nomeans disposed to view favourably the circumstances attaching tosam brattle on that saturday night</s>  when the great blow fell on thebrattle family his demeanour to them was changed and he forgavethe millers contumacy but he had always thought that sam had beenguilty</s>  the parson had from the first regarded the question withgreat doubt but nevertheless his opinion too had at first beenaverse to sam</s>  even now when he was so resolute that sam should bereleased he founded his demand not on sams innocence but on theabsence of any evidence against him</s> hes entitled to fair

dont take care hell find himself in trouble for keeping thelad locked up without authority</s>  is there a juryman in the countrywould find him guilty because he was lying in the old mans ditch aweek before</s>  in this way gilmore also became a favourer of samsclaim to be released and at last it came to be understood that onthe next tuesday he would be released unless further evidence shouldbe forthcoming</s> and then it came to pass that a certain very remarkable meeting tookplace in the parish</s>  word was brought to mr</s>  gilmore on monday the5th october that the marquis of trowbridge was to be at the churchfarmpoor trumbulls farmon that day at noon and that hislordship thought that it might be expedient that he and mr</s>  gilmoreshould meet on the occasion</s>  there was no note but the message wasbrought by mr</s>  packer a subagent one of the marquiss people withwhom mr</s>  gilmore was very well acquainted</s> ill walk down about that time packer said mr</s>  gilmore andshall be very happy to see his lordship</s> now the marquis never sat as a magistrate at the heytesbury benchand had not been present on any of the occasions on which sam hadbeen examined nor had mr</s>  gilmore seen the marquis since themurdernor for the matter of that for the last twelve months</s>  mr</s> gilmore had just finished breakfast when the news was brought to himand he thought he might as well walk down and see fenwick first</s>  hisinterview with the parson ended in a promise that he fenwick wouldalso look in at the farm</s> at twelve oclock the marquis was seated in the old farmersarmchair in the old farmers parlour</s>  the house was dark andgloomy never having been altogether opened since the murder</s>  withthe marquis was packer who was standing and the marquis waspretending to cast his eye over one or two books which had beenbrought to him</s>  he had been taken all over the house had stoodlooking at the bed where the old man lay when he was attackedas though he might possibly discover if he looked long enoughsomething that would reveal the truth had gazed awestruck at thespot on which the body had been found and had taken occasion toremark to himself that the house was a good deal out of order</s>  themarquis was a man nearer seventy than sixty but very hale and withfew signs of age</s>  he was short and plump with hardly any beard onhis face and short grey hair of which nothing could be seen when hewore his hat</s>  his countenance would not have been bad had not theweight of his marquisate always been there nor would his heart havebeen bad had it not been similarly burdened</s>  but he was a sillyweak ignorant man whose own capacity would hardly have procuredbread for him in any trade or profession had bread not been soadequately provided for him by his fathers before him</s> mr</s>  gilmore said he would be here at twelve packer</s> yes my lord</s> and its past twelve now</s> one minute my lord</s> then the peer looked again at poor old trumbulls books</s> i shall not wait packer</s> no my lord</s> you had better tell them to put the horses to</s> yes my lord</s> but just as packer went out into the passage for the sake of givingthe order he met mr</s>  gilmore and ushered him into the room</s> ha</s>  mr</s>  gilmore yes i am very glad to see you mr</s>  gilmore andthe marquis came forward to shake hands with his visitor</s>  i thoughtit better that you and i should meet about this sad affair in theparisha very sad affair indeed</s> it certainly is lord trowbridge and the mystery makes it more so</s> i suppose there is no real mystery mr</s>  gilmore</s>  i suppose there canbe no doubt that that unfortunate young man diddiddid bear ahand in it at least</s> i think that there is very much doubt my lord</s> do you indeed</s>  i think there is nonenot the least</s>  and all thepolice force are of the same opinion</s>  i have considerable experiencesof my own in these matters but i should not venture perhaps toexpress my opinion so confidently if i were not backed by thepolice</s>  you are aware mr</s>  gilmore that the police areveryseldomwrong</s> i should be tempted to say that they are very seldom rightexceptwhen the circumstances are all under their noses</s> i must say i differ from you entirely mr</s>  gilmore</s>  now in thiscase the marquis was here interrupted by a knock at the door andbefore the summons could be answered the parson entered the room</s> and with the parson came mr</s>  puddleham</s>  the marquis had thought thatthe parson might perhaps intrude and mr</s>  puddleham was in waitingas a makeweight should he be wanting</s>  when mr</s>  fenwick had metthe minister hanging about the farmyard he had displayed not theslightest anger</s>  if mr</s>  puddleham chose to come in also and makegood his doing so before the marquis it was nothing to mr</s>  fenwick</s> the great man looked up as though he were very much startled andsomewhat offended but he did at last condescend to shake handsfirst with one clergyman and then with the other and to ask them tosit down</s>  he explained that he had come over to make some personalinquiry into the melancholy matter and then proceeded with hisopinion respecting sam brattle</s>  from all that i can hear and seesaid his lordship i fear there can be no doubt that this murder hasbeen due to the malignity of a near neighbour</s> do you mean the poor boy that is in prison my lord</s>  asked theparson</s> of course i do mr</s>  fenwick</s>  the constabulary are of opinionwe know that lord trowbridge</s> perhaps mr</s>  fenwick you will allow me to express my own ideas</s>  theconstabulary i say are of opinion that there is no manner of doubtthat he was one of those who broke into my tenants house on thatfatal night and as i was explaining to mr</s>  gilmore when you did usthe honour to join us in the course of a long provincial experiencei have seldom known the police to be in error</s> why lord trowbridge</s> if you please mr</s>  fenwick i will go on</s>  my time here cannot belong and i have a proposition which i am desirous of making tomr</s>  gilmore as a magistrate acting in this part of the county</s>  ofcourse it is not for me to animadvert upon what the magistrates maydo at the bench tomorrow</s> i am sure your lordship would make no such animadversion said mr</s> gilmore</s> i do not intend it for many reasons</s>  but i may go so far as to saythat a demand for the young mans release will be made</s> he is to be released i presume as a matter of course said theparson</s> the marquis made no allusion to this but went on</s>  if that bedoneand i must say that i think no such step would be taken by thebench at westburywhither will the young man betake himself</s> home to his father of course said the parson</s> back into this parish with his paramour to murder more of mytenants</s> my lord i cannot allow such an unjust statement to be made saidthe parson</s> i wish to speak for one moment and i wish it to be remembered thati am addressing myself especially to your neighbour mr</s>  gilmore whohas done me the honour of waiting upon me here at my request</s>  i donot object to your presence mr</s>  fenwick or to that of any othergentleman and the marquis bowed to mr</s>  puddleham who had stood byhitherto without speaking a word but if you please i must carryout the purpose that has brought me here</s>  i shall think it very sadindeed if this young man be allowed to take up his residence in theparish after what has taken place</s> his father has a house here said mr</s>  gilmore</s> i am aware of the fact said the marquis</s>  i believe that the youngmans father holds a mill from you and some few acres of land</s> he has a very nice farm</s> so be it</s>  we will not quarrel about terms</s>  i believe there is nolease</s> though of course that is no business of mine</s> i must say that it is not my lord said mr</s>  gilmore who waswaxing wrothy and becoming very black about the brows</s> i have just said so but i suppose you will admit that i have someinterest in this parish</s>  i presume that these two gentlemen who aregods ministers here will acknowledge that it is my duty as theowner of the greater part of the parish to interfere</s> certainly my lord said mr</s>  puddleham</s> mr</s>  fenwick said nothing</s>  he sat or rather leant against the edgeof a table and smiled</s>  his brow was not black like that of hisfriend but gilmore who knew him and who looked into his facebegan to fear that the marquis would be addressed before long interms stronger than he himself mr</s>  gilmore would approve</s> and when i remember continued his lordship that the unfortunateman who has fallen a victim had been for nearly half a century atenant of myself and of my family and that he was foully murderedon my own propertydragged from his bed in the middle of the nightand ruthlessly slaughtered in this very house in which i am sittingand that this has been done in a parish of which i own i thinksomething over twothirdstwo thousand and two acres out of two thousand nine hundred andten said mr</s>  puddleham</s> i suppose so</s>  well mr</s>  puddleham you need not have interruptedme</s> i beg pardon my lord</s> what i mean to say is this mr</s>  gilmorethat you should take stepsto prevent that young mans return among our people</s>  you shouldexplain to the father that it cannot be allowed</s>  from what i hear itwould be no loss if the whole family left the parish</s>  i am told thatone of the daughters is aprostitute</s> it is too true my lord said mr</s>  puddleham</s> the parson turned round and looked at his colleague but saidnothing</s>  it was one of the principles of his life that he wouldntquarrel with mr</s>  puddleham and at the present moment he certainlydid not wish to waste his anger on so weak an enemy</s> i think that you should look to this mr</s>  gilmore said themarquis completing his harangue</s> i cannot conceive my lord what right you have to dictate to me insuch a matter said mr</s>  gilmore</s> i have not dictated at all i have simply expressed my opinionsaid the marquis</s> now my lord will you allow me for a moment</s>  said mr</s>  fenwick</s> in the first place if sam brattle could not find a home at themillwhich i hope he will do for many a long year to comeheshould have one at the vicarage</s> i dare say said the marquis</s> mr</s>  puddleham held up both hands</s> you might as well hold your tongue frank said gilmore</s> it is a matter on which i wish to say a word or two harry</s>  i havebeen appealed to as one of gods ministers here and i acknowledge myresponsibility</s>  i never in my life heard any proposition more cruelor inhuman than that made by lord trowbridge</s>  this young man is to beturned out because a tenant of his lordship has been murdered</s>  he isto be adjudged to be guilty by us without any trial in the absenceof all evidence in opposition to the decision of the magistratesit is not in opposition to the magistrates sir said the marquis</s> and to be forbidden to return to his own home simply because lordtrowbridge thinks him guilty</s>  my lord his fathers house is his ownto entertain whom he may please as much as is yours</s>  and were i tosuggest to you to turn out your daughters it would be no worse anoffence than your suggesting to mr</s>  brattle that he should turn outhis son</s> my daughters</s> yes your daughters my lord</s> how dare you mention my daughters</s> illustration how dare you mention my daughters</s> the ladies i am well aware are all that is respectable</s>  i havenot the slightest wish that you should illuse them</s>  but if youdesire that your

forpackerwas calling for his carriage and horseswas calling onthe very gods to send down their thunder to punish such insolenceas this</s>  he had never heard of the like in all his experience</s>  hisdaughters</s>  and then there came across his dismayed mind an idea thathis daughters had been put upon a par with that young murderer sambrattleperhaps even on a par with something worse than this</s>  andhis daughters were such august personsold and ugly it is trueand almost dowerless in consequence of the nature of the familysettlements and family expenditure</s>  it was an injury and an insultthat mr</s>  fenwick should make the slightest allusion to his daughtersbut to talk of them in such a way as this as though they weremere ordinary human beings was not to be endured</s>  the marquis hadhitherto had his doubts but now he was quite sure that mr</s>  fenwickwas an infidel</s>  and a very bad sort of infidel too as he said tolady carolina on his return home</s>  i never heard of such conduct inall my life said lord trowbridge walking down to his carriage</s> who can be surprised that there should be murderers and prostitutesin the parish</s> my lord they dont sit under me

asked him whether he hadmeans of getting home to which he replied that it wasnt no morethan a walk</s>  dinner was offered to him by the constable but this herefused and then he stood glaring about him</s>  after a while gilmoreand fenwick came up to him and the squire was the first to speak</s> brattle he said i hope you will now go home and remain thereworking with your father for the present</s> i dont know nothing about that said the lad not deigning to lookat the squire</s> sam pray go home at once said the parson</s>  we have done what wecould for you and you should not oppose us</s> mr</s>  fenwick if you tells me to go tototohe was going tomention some very bad place but was restrained by the parsonspresenceif you tells me to go anywheres ill go</s> thats right</s>  then i tell you to go to the mill</s> i dont know as fatherll let me in said he almost breaking intosobs as he spoke</s> that he will heartily</s>  do you tell him that you had a word or twowith me here and that ill come up and call on him tomorrow</s>  thenhe put his hand into his pocket and whispering something offeredthe lad money</s>  but sam turned away and shook his head and walkedoff</s>  i dont believe that that fellow had any more to do with itthan you or i said fenwick</s> i dont know what to believe said gilmore</s>  have you heard thatthe marquis is in the town</s>  greenthorne just told me so</s> then i had better get out of it for heytesbury isnt big enoughfor the two of us</s>  come youve done here and we might as well joghome</s> gilmore dined at the vicarage that evening and of course the dayswork was discussed</s>  the quarrel too which had taken place at thefarmhouse had only yet been in part described to mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  doyou know i feel half triumphant and half frightened mrs</s>  fenwicksaid to the squire</s>  i know that the marquis is an old foolimperious conceited and altogether unendurable when he attemptsto interfere</s>  and yet i have a kind of feeling that because he is amarquis and because he owns two thousand and so many acres in theparish and because he lives at turnover park one ought to hold himin awe</s> frank didnt hold him in awe yesterday said the squire</s> he holds nothing in awe said the wife</s> you wrong me there janet</s>  i hold you in great awe and every ladyin wiltshire more or lessand i think i may say every woman</s>  andi would hold him in a sort of awe too if he didnt drive me beyondmyself by his mixture of folly and pride</s> he can do us a great deal of mischief you know said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> what he can do he will do said the parson</s>  he even gave me a badname no doubt but i fancy he was generous enough to me in that waybefore yesterday</s>  he will now declare that i am the evil one himselfand people wont believe that</s>  a continued persistent enmityalways at work but kept within moderate bounds is more dangerousnowadays than a hot fever of revengeful wrath</s>  the marquis cantsend out his menatarms and have me knocked on the head or castinto a dungeon</s>  he can only throw mud at me and the more he throwsat once the less will reach me</s> as to sam they were agreed that whether he were innocent or guiltythe old miller should be induced to regard him as innocent as far astheir joint exertion in that direction might avail</s> he is innocent before the law till he has been proved to be guiltysaid the squire</s> then of course there can be nothing wrong in telling his father thathe is innocent said the lady</s> the squire did not quite admit this and the parson smiled as heheard the argument but they both acknowledged that it would be rightto let it be considered throughout the parish that sam was to beregarded as blameless for that nights transaction</s>  nevertheless mr</s> gilmores mind on the subject was not changed</s> have you heard from loring</s>  the squire asked mrs</s>  fenwick as he gotup to leave the vicarage</s> oh yesconstantly</s>  she is quite well mr</s>  gilmore</s> i sometimes think that ill go off and have a look at her</s> im sure both she and her aunt would be glad to see you</s> but would it be wise</s> if you ask me i am bound to say that i think it would not be wise</s> if i were you i would leave her for awhile</s>  mary is as good as goldbut she is a woman and like other women the more she is soughtthe more difficult she will be</s> it always seems to me said mr</s>  gilmore that to be successful inlove a man should not be in love at all or at any rate he shouldhide it</s>  then he went off home alone feeling on his heart thatpernicious load of a burden which comes from the unrestrained longingfor some good thing which cannot be attained</s>  it seemed to him nowthat nothing in life would be worth a thought if mary lowther shouldcontinue to say him nay and it seemed to him too that unless theyea were said very quickly all his aptitudes for enjoyment would beworn out of him</s> on the next morning immediately after breakfast mr</s>  and mrs</s> fenwick walked down to the mill together</s>  they went through thevillage and thence by a pathway down to a little footbridge and soalong the river side</s>  it was a beautiful october morning the 7th ofoctober and fenwick talked of the pheasants</s>  gilmore though he wasa sportsman and shot rabbits and partridges about his own propertyand went occasionally to shootingparties at a distance preservedno game</s>  there had been some old unpleasantness about the marquisspheasants and he had given it up</s>  there could be no doubt that hisproperty in the parish being chiefly low lying lands and water meadsunfit for coverts was not well disposed for preserving pheasantsand that in shooting he would more likely shoot lord trowbridgesbirds than his own</s>  but it was equally certain that lord trowbridgespheasants made no scruple of feeding on his land</s>  nevertheless hehad thought it right to give up all idea of keeping up a head of gamefor his own use in bullhampton</s> upon my word if i were you gilmore said the parson as a birdrose from the ground close at their feet i should cease to be niceabout the shooting after what happened yesterday</s> you dont mean that you would retaliate frank</s> i think i should</s> is that good parsons law</s> its very good squires law</s>  and as for that doctrine ofnonretaliation a man should be very sure of his own motives beforehe submits to it</s>  if a man be quite certain that he is reallyactuated by a christians desire to forgive it may be all very wellbut if there be any admixture of base alloy in his gold if he allowshimself to think that he may avoid the evils of pugnacity and havethings go smooth for him here and become a good christian by thesame process why then i think he is likely to fall to the groundbetween two stools</s>  had lord trowbridge heard him his lordshipwould now have been quite sure that mr</s>  fenwick was an infidel</s> they had both doubted whether sam would be found at the mill butthere he was hard at work among the skeleton timbers when hisfriends reached the place</s> i am glad to see you at home again sam said mrs</s>  fenwick withsomething however of an inner feeling that perhaps she might besaluting a murderer</s> sam touched his cap but did not utter a word or look away from hiswork</s>  they passed on amidst the heaps in front of the mill and cameto the porch before the cottage</s>  here as had been his wont in allthese idle days the miller was sitting with a pipe in his mouth</s> when he saw the lady he got up and ducked his head and then sat downagain</s>  if your wife is here ill just step in mr</s>  brattle saidmrs</s>  fenwick</s> she be there maam said the miller pointing towards the kitchenwindow with his head</s>  so mrs</s>  fenwick lifted the latch and entered</s> the parson sat himself down by the millers side</s> i am heartily glad mr</s>  brattle that sam is back with you here onceagain</s> he be there at work among the rest o em said the miller</s> i saw him as i came along</s>  i hope he will remain here now</s> i cant say muster fenwick</s> but he intends to do so</s> i cant say muster fenwick</s> would it not be well that you should ask him</s> not as i knows on muster fenwick</s> it was manifest enough that the old man had not spoken to his sonon the subject of the murder and that there was no confidenceatleast no confidence that had been expressedbetween the father andthe son</s>  no one had as yet heard the miller utter any opinion as tosams innocence or his guilt</s>  this of itself seemed to the clergymanto be a very terrible condition for two persons who were so closelyunited and who were to live together work together eat togetherand have mutual interests</s> i hope mr</s>  brattle he said that you give sam the full benefitof his discharge</s> hell get his vittles and his bed and a trifle of wages if he worksfor em</s> i didnt mean that</s>  im quite sure you wouldnt see him want acomfortable home as long as you have one to give him</s> there aint much comfort about it now</s> i was speaking of your own opinion of the deed that was done</s>  my ownopinion is that sam had nothing to do with it</s> im sure i cant say muster fenwick</s> but it would be a comfort to you to think that he is innocent</s> i aint no comfort in talking about itnot at alland idrayther not if its all one to you muster fenwick</s> i will not ask another question but ill repeat my own opinion mr</s> brattle</s>  i dont believe that he had anything more to do with therobbery or the murder than i had</s> i hope not muster fenwick</s>  murder is a terrible crime</s>  and now ifyoull tell me how much it was you paid the lawyer at heytesburyi cannot say as yet</s>  it will be some trifle</s>  you need not troubleyourself about that</s> but i mean to pay un muster fenwick</s>  i can pay my way as yetthough its hard enough at times</s>  the parson was obliged to promisethat mr</s>  joness bill of charges should be sent to him and then hecalled his wife and they left the mill</s>  sam was still up among thetimbers and had not once come down while the visitors were in thecottage</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick had been more successful with the women thanthe parson had been with the father</s>  she had taken upon herself tosay that she thoroughly believed sam to be innocent and they hadthanked her with many protestations of gratitude</s> they did not go back by the way they had come but went up to theroad which they crossed and thence to some outlying cottages whichwere not very far from hampton privets house</s>  from these cottagesthere was a path across the fields back to bullhampton which led bythe side of a small wood belonging to the marquis</s>  there was a gooddeal of woodland just here and this special copse called hamptonbushes was known to be one of the best pheasant coverts in that partof the country</s>  whom should they meet standing on the path armedwith his gun and with his keeper behind him armed with another thanthe marquis of trowbridge himself</s>  they had heard a shot or two butthey had thought nothing of it or they would have gone back to theroad</s>  dont speak said the parson as he walked on quickly withhis wife on his arm</s>  the marquis stood and scowled but he had thebreeding of a gentleman and when mrs</s>  fenwick was close to him heraised his hat</s>  the parson also raised his the lady bowed and thenthey passed on without a word</s>  i had no excuse for doing so or iwould certainly have told him that sam brattle was comfortably athome with his father said the parson</s> how you do like a fight frank</s> if its stand up and all fair i dont dislike it</s> chapter xx</s> i have a jupiter of my own now</s> when mary lowther returned home from the last walk with her cousinthat has been mentioned she was quite determined that she wouldnot disturb her happiness on that night by the task of telling herengagement to her aunt</s>  it must of course be told and that atonce and it must be told also to parson john and a letter must bewritten to janet and another which would be very difficult in thewriting to mr</s>  gilmore and she must be prepared to bear a certainamount of opposition from all her friends but for the presentmoment she would free herself from these troubles</s>  tomorrow afterbreakfast she would tell her aunt</s>  tomorrow at lunchtime walterwould come up to the lane as her accepted lover</s>  and then afterlunch after due consultation with him and with aunt sarah theletter should be written</s> she had solved at any rate one doubt and had investigated onemystery</s>  while conscious of her own coldness towards mr</s>  gilmore shehad doubted whether she was capable of loving a man of loving him asjanet fenwick loved her husband</s>  now she would not admit to herselfthat any woman that ever lived adored a man more thoroughly than sheadored walter marrable</s>  it was sweet to her to see and to rememberthe motions of his body</s>  when walking by his side she could hardlyforbear to touch him with her shoulder</s>  when parting from him it wasa regret to her to take her hand from his</s>  and she told herself thatall this had come to her in the course of one mornings walk andwondered at itthat her heart should be a thing capable of beinggiven away so quickly</s>  it had in truth been given away quicklyenough though the work had not been done in that one mornings walk</s> she had been truly honest to herself and to others when she saidthat her cousin walter was and should be a brother to her but hadher new brother in his brotherly confidence told her that hisheart was devoted to some other woman she would have suffered ablow though she would never have confessed even to herself thatshe suffered</s>  on that evening when she reached home she said verylittle</s> she was so tired</s>  might she go to bed</s>  what at nine oclock</s>  askedaunt sarah</s> ill stay up if you wish it said mary</s> but before ten she was alone in her own chamber sitting in her ownchair with her arms folded feeling rather than thinking howdivine a thing it was to be in love</s>  what could she not do for him</s> what would she not endure to have the privilege of living with him</s> what other good fortune in life could be equal to this good fortune</s> then she thought of her relations with mr</s>  gilmore and shudderedas she remembered how near she had been to accepting him</s>  it wouldhave been so wrong</s>  and yet i did not see it</s>  with him i am sure thatit is right for i feel that in going to him i can be every bit hisown</s> so she thought and so she dreamed and then the morning came andshe had to go down to her aunt</s>  she ate her breakfast almost insilence having resolved that she would tell her story the momentbreakfast was over</s>  she had over night and while she was in bedstudiously endeavoured not to con any mode of telling it</s>  up tothe moment at which she rose her happiness was if possible to beuntroubled</s>  but while she dressed herself she endeavoured to arrangeher plans</s>  she at last came to the conclusion that she could do itbest without any plan</s> as soon as aunt sarah had finished her breakfast and just as shewas about to proceed according to her morning custom downstairsto the kitchen mary spoke</s>  aunt sarah i have something to tellyou</s>  i may as well bring it out at once</s>  i am engaged to marry waltermarrable</s>  aunt sarah immediately let fall the sugartongs and stoodspeechless</s>  dear aunt do not look as if you were displeased</s>  say akind word to me</s>  i am sure you do not think that i have intended todeceive you</s> no i do not think that said aunt sarah</s> and is that all</s> i am very much surprised</s>  it was yesterday that you told me wheni hinted at this that he was no more to you than a cousinor abrother</s> and so i thought indeed i did</s>  but when he told me how it was withhim i knew at once that i had only one answer to give</s>  no otheranswer was possible</s>  i love him better than anyone else in all theworld</s>  i feel that i can promise to be his wife without the leastreserve or fear</s>  i dont know why it should be so but it is</s>  iknow i am right in this</s>  aunt sarah still stood silent meditating</s> dont you think i was right feeling as i do to tell him so</s>  i hadbefore become certain quite quite certain that it was impossible togive any other answer but one to mr</s>  gilmore</s>  dearest aunt do speakto me</s> i do not know what you will have to live upon</s> it is settled you know that he will save four or five thousandpounds out of his money and i have got twelve hundred</s>  it is notmuch but it will be just something</s>  of course he will remain in thearmy and i shall be a soldiers wife</s>  i shall think nothing of goingout to india if he wishes it but i dont think he means that</s>  dearaunt sarah do say one word of congratulation</s> aunt sarah did not know how to congratulate her niece</s>  it seemed toher that any congratulation must be false and hypocritical</s>  to herthinking it would be a most unfitting match</s>  it seemed to her thatsuch an engagement had been most foolish</s>  she was astonished atmarys weakness and was indignant with walter marrable</s>  as regardedmary though she had twice uttered a word or two intended as acaution yet she had never thought it possible that a girl so steadyin her ordinary demeanour so utterly averse to all flirtation solittle given to the weakness of feminine susceptibility would fallat once into such a quagmire of indiscreet lovetroubles</s>  the cautionhad been intended rather in regard to outward appearances andperhaps with the view of preventing the possibility of some slightheartscratches than with the idea that danger of this nature was tobe dreaded</s>  as mr</s>  gilmore was there as an acknowledged suitorasuitor as to whose ultimate success aunt sarah had her strongopinionsit would be well those cousinlybrotherly associationsand confidences should not become so close as to create possibleembarrassment</s>  such had been the nature of aunt sarahs caution andnowin the course of a week or twowhen the young people werein truth still strangers to each otherwhen mr</s>  gilmore was stillwaiting for his answermary came to her and told her that theengagement was a thing completed</s>  how could she utter a word ofcongratulation</s> you mean then to say that you disapprove of it</s>  said mary almoststernly</s> i cannot say that i think it wise</s> i am not speaking of wisdom</s>  of course mr</s>  gilmore is very muchricher and all that</s> you know mary that i would not counsel you to marry a man becausehe was rich</s> that is what you mean when you tell me i am not wise</s>  i trieditwith all the power of thought and calculation that i could giveto it and i found that i could not marry mr</s>  gilmore</s> i am not speaking about that now</s> you mean that walter is so poor that he never should be allowed tomarry</s> i dont care twopence about walter</s> but i do aunt sarah</s>  i care more about him than all the worldbeside</s>  i had to think for him</s> you did not take much time to think</s> hardly a minuteand yet it was sufficient</s>  then she pausedwaiting for her aunt but it seemed that her aunt had nothing furtherto say</s>  well continued mary if it must be so it must</s>  if youcannot wish me joydearest you know well enough that i wish you all happiness</s> this is my happiness</s>  it seemed to the bewildered old lady that thewhole nature of the girl was altered</s>  mary was speaking now as mighthave spoken some enthusiastic young female who had at last succeededin obtaining for herself the possessionmore or less permanentofa young man after having fed her imagination on novels for the lastfive years whereas mary lowther had hitherto in all moods of herlife been completely opposite to such feminine ways and doings</s> very well continued mary we will say nothing more about it atpresent</s>  i am greatly grieved that i have incurred your displeasurebut i cannot wish it otherwise</s> i have said nothing of displeasure</s> walter is to be up after lunch and i will only ask that he may notbe received with black looks</s>  if it must be visited as a sin let itbe visited on me</s> mary that is unkind and ungenerous</s> if you knew aunt sarah how i have longed during the night for yourkind voicefor your sympathy and approval</s> aunt sarah paused again for a moment and then went down to herdomestic duties without another word</s> in the afternoon walter came but aunt sarah did not see him</s>  whenmary went to her the old lady declared that for the present itwould be better so</s>  i do not know what to say to him at present</s>  imust think of it and speak to his uncle and try to find out whathad best be done</s> she was sitting as she said this up in her own room without even abook in her hand in very truth passing an hour in an endeavour todecide what in the present emergency she ought to say or do</s>  marystooped over her and kissed her and the aunt returned her niecescaresses</s> do not let you and me quarrel at any rate said miss marrable</s> who else is there that i care for</s>  whose happiness is anything to meexcept yours</s> then come to him and tell him that he also shall be dear to you</s> no at any rate not now</s>  of course you can marry mary without anysanction from me</s>  i do not pretend that you owe to me that obediencewhich would be due to a mother</s>  but i cannot sayat least notyetthat such sanction as i have to give can be given to thisengagement</s>  i have a dread that it will come to no good</s>  it grievesme</s>  i do not forbid you to receive him but for the present it wouldbe better that i should not see him</s> what is her objection</s>  demanded walter with grave indignation</s> she thinks we shall be poor</s> shall we ask her for anything</s>  of course we shall be poor</s>  for thepresent there will be but 300 a year or thereabouts beyond myprofessional income</s>  a few years back if so much had been securedfriends would have thought that everything necessary had been done</s> if you are afraid maryyou know i am not afraid</s> what is it to her then</s>  of course we shall be poorvery poor</s>  butwe can live</s> there did come upon mary lowther a feeling that walter spoke of thenecessity of a comfortable income in a manner very different fromthat in which he had of late been discussing the same subject eversince she had known him</s>  he had declared that it was impossible thathe should exist in england as a bachelor on his professional incomeand yet surely he would be poorer as a married man with that 300a year added to it than he would have been without it and alsowithout a wife</s>  but what girl that loves a man can be angry with himfor such imprudence and such inconsistency</s>  she had already told himthat she would be ready if it were necessary to go with him toindia</s>  she had said so before she went up to her aunts room</s>  he hadreplied that he hoped no such sacrifice would be demanded from her</s> there can be no sacrifice on my part she had replied unless iam required to give up you</s>  of course he had taken her in his armsand kissed her</s>  there are moments in ones life in which not to beimprudent not to be utterly childishly forgetful of all worldlywisdom would be to be brutal inhuman and devilish</s>  had he toldparson john</s>  she asked</s> oh yes</s> and what does he say</s> just nothing</s>  he raised his eyebrows and suggested that i hadchanged my ideas of life</s>  so i have i said</s>  all right</s>  hereplied</s>  i hope that block and curling wont have made any mistakeabout the 5000</s>  that was all he said</s>  no doubt he thinks were twofools but then ones folly wont embarrass him</s> nor will it embarrass aunt sarah said mary</s> but there is this difference</s>  if we come to grief parson john willeat his dinner without the slightest interference with his appetitefrom our misfortunes but aunt sarah would suffer on your account</s> she would certainly said mary</s> but we will not come to grief</s>  at any rate darling we cannotconsent to be made wise by the prospect of her possible sorrows onour behalf</s> it was agreed that on that afternoon mary should write both to mr</s> gilmore and to janet fenwick</s>  she offered to keep her letters andshow them when written to her lover but he declared that he wouldprefer not to see them</s>  it is enough for me that i triumph hesaid as he left her</s>  when he had gone she at once told her auntthat she would write the letters and bring that to mr</s>  gilmore to beread by her when they were finished</s> i would postpone it for awhile if i were you said aunt sarah</s> but mary declared that any such delay would be unfair to mr</s>  gilmore</s> she did write the letters before dinner and they were as follows my dear mr</s>  gilmore when last you came down to the vicarage to see me i promised you as you may perhaps remember that if it should come to pass that i should engage myself to any other man i would at once let you know that it was so</s>  i little thought then that i should so soon be called upon to keep my promise</s>  i will not pretend that the writing of this letter is not very painful to me but i know that it is my duty to write it and to put an end to a suspense which you have been good enough to feel on my account</s>  you have i think heard the name of my cousin captain walter marrable who returned from india two or three months ago</s>  i found him staying here with his uncle the clergyman and now i am engaged to be his wife</s>  perhaps it would be better that i should say nothing more than this and that i should leave myself and my character and name to your future kindnessor unkindnesswithout any attempt to win the former or to decry the latter but you have been to me ever so good and noble that i cannot bring myself to be so cold and short</s>  i have always felt that your preference for me has been a great honour to me</s>  i have appreciated your esteem most highly and have valued your approbation more than i have been able to say</s>  if it could be possible that i should in future have your friendship i should value it more than that of any other person</s>  god bless you mr</s>  gilmore</s>  i shall always hope that you may be happy and i shall hear with delight any tidings which may seem to show that you are so</s>  pray believe that i am your most sincere friend mary

should ever have that sort of love for a man for which i used to envy you</s>  i dont envy you any longer and i dont regard mr</s>  fenwick as being nearly so divine as i used to do</s>  i have a

could i tell him</s>  i have said something horribly stilted about esteem and friendship which i would have left out only that my letter seemed to be heartless without it</s>  he has been to me as good as a man could be but was it my fault that i could not love him</s>  if you knew how i triedhow i tried to make believe to myself that i loved him how i tried to teach myself that that sort of very chill approbation was the nearest approach to love that i could ever reach and how i did this because you bade meif you could understand all this then you would not scold me</s>  and i did almost believe that it was so</s>  but now</s>  oh dear</s>  how would it have been if i had engaged myself to mr</s>  gilmore and that then walter marrable had come to me</s>  i get sick when i think how near i was to saying that i would love a man whom i never could have loved</s>  of course i used to ask myself what i should do with myself</s>  i suppose every woman living has to ask and to answer that question</s>  i used to try to think that it would be well not to think of the outer crust of myself</s>  what did it matter whether things were soft to me or not</s>  i could do my duty</s>  and as this man was good and a gentleman and endowed with high qualities and appropriate tastes why should he not have the wife he wanted</s>  i thought that i could pretend to love him till after some fashion i should love him but as i think of it now all this seems to be so horrid</s>  i know now what to do with myself</s>  to be his from head to foot</s>  to feel that nothing done for him would be mean or distasteful</s>  to stand at a washtub and wash his clothes if it were wanted</s>  oh janet i used to dread the time in which he would have to put his arm round me and kiss me</s>  i cannot

that he wouldhimself speak to walter</s>  nothing would come of it but as his cousinasked him he would speak to his nephew</s> he waited for fourandtwenty hours before he spoke and during thattime was subject to none of those terrors which were now making missmarrables life a burden to her</s>  in his opinion it was almost apity that a young fellow like walter should be interrupted in hisamusement</s>  according to his view of life very much wisdom was notexpected from ladies young or old</s>  they for the most part hadtheir bread found for them and were not required to do anythingwhether they were rich or poor</s>  let them be ever so poor thedisgrace of poverty did not fall upon them as it did upon men</s>  butthen if they would run their heads into trouble trouble came harderupon them than on men and for that they had nobody to blame butthemselves</s>  of course it was a very nice thing to be in love</s>  versesand pretty speeches and easyspoken romance were pleasant enough intheir way</s>  parson john had no doubt tried them himself in early lifeand had found how far they were efficacious for his own happiness</s> but young women were so apt to want too much of the excitement</s>  ayoung man at bullhampton was not enough without another young man atloring</s>  that we fear was the mode in which parson john looked atthe subjectwhich mode of looking at it had he ever ventured toexplain it to mary lowther would have brought down upon his headfrom that young woman an amount of indignant scorn which would havebeen very disagreeable to parson john</s>  but then he was a great dealtoo wise to open his mind on such a subject to mary lowther</s> i think sir id better go up and see curling again next weeksaid the captain</s> i dare say</s>  is anything not going right</s> i suppose i shall get the money but i shall like to know when</s>  i amvery anxious of course to fix a day for my marriage</s> i should not be over quick about that if i were you

shall go back to my regiment next month unless we maymake up our minds to go out to india</s> what you and mary</s> yes i and mary</s> as man and wife</s>  said parson john with a smile</s> how else should we go</s> well no</s>  if she goes with you she must go as mrs</s>  captainmarrable of course</s>  but if i were you i would not think of anythingso horrible</s> it would be horrible said walter marrable</s> i should think it would</s>  india may be very well when a man is quiteyoung and if he can keep himself from beer and wine but to go backthere at your time of life with a wife and to look forward to adozen children there must be an unpleasant prospect i should say</s> walter marrable sat silent and black</s> i should give up all idea of india continued his uncle</s> what the deuce is a man to do</s>  asked the captain</s> the parson shrugged his shoulders</s> ill tell you what ive been thinking of said the captain</s>  if icould get a farm of four or five hundred acresa farm</s>  exclaimed the parson</s> why not a farm</s>  i know that a man can do nothing with a farm unlesshe has capital</s>
 i should have that and some trifle of an income besides ifi sold out</s>  i suppose my uncle would let me have a farm under him</s> hed see youfurther first</s> why shouldnt i do as well with a farm as another</s> why not turn shoemaker</s>  because you have not learned the business</s> farmer indeed</s>  youd never get the farm and if you did you wouldnot keep it for three years</s>  youve been in the army too long to befit for anything else walter</s> captain marrable looked black and angry at being so counselled buthe believed what was said to him and had no answer to make to it</s> you must stick to the army continued the old man and if youlltake my advice youll do so without the impediment of a wife</s> thats quite out of the question</s> why is it out of the question</s> how can you ask me uncle john</s>  would you have me go back from anengagement after i have made it</s> i would have you go back from anything that was silly</s> and tell a girl after i have asked her to be my wife that i dontwant to have anything more to do with her</s> i should not tell her that but i should make her understand bothfor her own sake and for mine that we had been too fast and thatthe sooner we gave up our folly the better for both of us</s>  you cantmarry her thats the truth of it</s> youll see if i cant</s> if you choose to wait ten years you may</s> i wont wait ten months nor if i can have my own way ten weeks</s> what a pity that mary could not have heard him</s>  half the fellows inthe army are married without anything beyond their pay and im tobe told that we cant get along with 300 a year</s>  at any rate welltry</s> marry in haste and repent at leisure said uncle john</s> according to the doctrines that are going nowadays said thecaptain it will be held soon that a gentleman cant marry unlesshe has got 3000 a year</s>  it is the most heartless damnable teachingthat ever came up</s>  it spoils the men and makes women when they domarry expect ever so many things that they ought never to want</s> and you mean to teach them better walter</s> i mean to act for myself and not be frightened out of doing what ithink right because the world says this and that</s> as he so spoke the angry captain got up to leave the room</s> all the same rejoined the parson firing the last shot id thinktwice about it if i were you before i married mary lowther</s> hes more of an ass and twice as headstrong as i thought him saidparson john to miss marrable the next day but still i dont thinkit will come to anything</s>  as far as i can observe three of theseengagements are broken off for one that goes on</s>  and when he comes tolook at things hell get tired of it</s>  hes going up to london nextweek and i shant press him to come back</s>  if he does come i canthelp it</s>  if i were you i wouldnt ask him up the hill and i shouldtell miss mary a bit of my mind pretty plainly</s> hitherto as far as words went aunt sarah had told very little ofher mind to mary lowther on the subject of her engagement but shehad spoken as yet no word of congratulation and mary knew that themanner in which she proposed to bestow herself was not received withfavour by any of her relatives at loring</s> chapter xxii</s> what the fenwicks thought about it</s> bullhampton unfortunately was at the end of the postmans walk andas the man came all the way from lavington letters were seldomreceived much before eleven oclock</s>  now this was a most perniciousarrangement in respect to which mr</s>  fenwick carried on a perpetualfeud with the postoffice authorities having put forward a greatpostal doctrine that letters ought to be rained from heaven on toeverybodys breakfasttable exactly as the hot water is brought infor tea</s>  he being an energetic man carried on a long and angrycorrespondence with the authorities aforesaid but the old manfrom lavington continued to toddle into the village just at elevenoclock</s>  it was acknowledged that ten was his time but as he arguedwith himself ten and eleven were pretty much of a muchness</s>  theconsequence of this was that mary lowthers letters to mrs</s>  fenwickhad been read by her two or three hours before she had an opportunityof speaking on the subject to her husband</s>  at last however hereturned and she flew at him with the letter in her hand</s>  frankshe said frank what do you think has happened</s> the bank of england must have stopped from the look of your face</s> i wish it had with all my heart sooner than this</s>  mary has goneand engaged herself to her cousin walter marrable</s> mary lowther</s> yes mary lowther</s>  our mary</s>  and from what i remember hearing abouthim he is anything but nice</s> he had a lot of money left to him the other day</s> it cant have been much because mary owns that they will be verypoor</s>  here is her letter</s>  i am so unhappy about it</s>  dont youremember hearing about that colonel marrable who was in a horriblescrape about somebodys wife</s> you shouldnt judge the son from the father</s> theyve been in the army together and theyre both alike</s>  i hatethe army</s>  they are almost always no better than they should be</s> thats true my dear certainly of all services unless it be thearmy of martyrs and there may be a doubt on the subject even as tothem</s>  may i read it</s> oh yes she has been half ashamed of herself every word she haswritten</s>  i know her so well</s>  to think that mary lowther should haveengaged herself to any man after two days acquaintance</s> mr</s>  fenwick read the letter through attentively and then handed itback</s> its a good letter he said</s> you mean that its well written</s> i mean that its true</s>  there are no touches put in to make effect</s> she does love the one man and she doesnt love the other</s>  all i cansay is that im very sorry for it</s>  it will drive gilmore out of theplace</s> do you mean it</s> i do indeed</s>  i never knew a man to be at the same time so strongand so weak in such a matter</s>  one would say that the intensity of hisaffection would be the best pledge of his future happiness if he wereto marry the girl but seeing that he is not to marry her one cannotbut feel that a man shouldnt stake his happiness on a thing beyondhis reach</s> you think it is all up thenthat she really will marry this man</s> what else can i think</s> these things do go off sometimes</s>  there cant be much moneybecause you see old miss marrable opposes the whole thing onaccount of there not being income enough</s>  she is anything but richherself and is the last person of all the world to make a fuss aboutmoney</s>  if it could be broken off</s> if i understand mary lowther said mr</s>  fenwick she is not thewoman to have her match broken off for her by any person</s>  of course iknow nothing about the man but if he is firm shell be as firm</s> and then she has written to mr</s>  gilmore said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> its all up with harry as far as this goes said mr</s>  fenwick</s> the vicar had another matter of moment to discuss with his wife</s>  sambrattle after having remained hard at work at the mill for nearly afortnightso hard at work as to

had been made onaccount of mr</s>  trumbulls murder nor had any trace been found of thegrinder or of that other man who had been his companion</s>  the leadingpoliceman who still had charge of the case expressed himself assure that the old woman at pycroft common knew nothing of her sonswhereabouts but he had always declared and still continued todeclare that sam brattle could tell them the whole story of themurder if he pleased and there had been a certain amount of watchingkept on the young man much to his own disgust and to that of hisfather</s>  sam had sworn aloud in the villageso much aloud that he hadshown his determination to be heard by all menthat he would go toamerica and see whether anyone would dare to stop him</s>  he had beentold of his bail and had replied that he would demand to be relievedof his bailthat his bail was illegal and that he would have itall tried in a court of law</s>  mr</s>  fenwick had heard of this and hadreplied that as far as he was concerned he was not in the leastafraid</s>  he believed that the bail was illegal and he believed alsothat sam would stay where he was</s>  but now sam was gone and thebullhampton constable was clearly of opinion that he had gone to jointhe grinder</s>  at any rate hes off somewhere said mr</s>  fenwickand his mother doesnt know where hes gone</s>  old brattle of coursewont say a word</s> and will it hurt you</s> not unless they get hold of those other fellows and require samsappearance</s>  i dont doubt but that hed turn up in that case</s> then it does not signify</s> it signifies for him</s>  ive an idea that i know where hes gone andi think i shall go after him</s> is it far frank</s> something short of australia luckily</s> oh frank</s> ill tell you the truth</s>  its my belief that carry brattle is livingabout twenty miles off and that hes gone to see his sister</s> carry brattle</s> down here</s> i dont know it and i dont want to hear it mentioned but i fancyit is

bring her backhere</s> ah who can say</s>  i should tell her mother and i suppose we shouldhave to ask her father to receive her</s>  i know what his answer willbe</s> hell refuse to see her</s> no doubt</s>  then we should have to put our heads together and thechances are that the poor girl will be off in the meantimeback tolondon and the devil</s>  it is not easy to set crooked things straight</s> in spite however of this interruption mary lowther and herengagement to captain marrable was the subject of greatest interestat the vicarage that day and through the night</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick halfexpected that gilmore would come down in the evening but the vicardeclared that his friend would be unwilling to show himself after theblow which he would have received</s>  they knew that he would know thatthey had received the news and that therefore he could not comeeither to tell it or with the intention of asking questions withouttelling it</s>  if he came at all he must come like a beaten cur withhis tail between his legs</s>  and then there arose the question whetherit would not be better that marys letter should be answered beforemr</s>  gilmore was seen</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick whose fingers were itching forpen and paper declared at last that she would write at once and didwrite as follows before she went to bed the vicarage friday</s>  dearest mary i do not know how to answer your letter</s>  you tell me to write pleasantly and to congratulate you but how is one to do that so utterly in opposition to ones own interests and wishes</s>  oh dear oh dear</s>  how i do so wish you had stayed at bullhampton</s>  i know you will be angry with me for saying so but how can i say anything else</s>  i cannot picture you to myself going about from town to town and living in countryquarters</s>  and as i never saw captain marrable to the best of my belief i cannot interest myself about him as i do about one whom i know and love and esteem</s>  i feel that this is not a nice way of writing to you and indeed i would be nice if i could</s>  of course i wish you to be full of joyof course i wish with all my heart that you may be happy if you marry your cousin but the thing has come so suddenly that we cannot bring ourselves to look upon it as a reality</s> you should speak for yourself janet said mr</s>  fenwick when hecame to this part of the letter</s>  he did not however require thatthe sentence should be altered</s>  you talk so much of doing what is right</s>  nobody has ever doubted that you were right both in morals and sentiment</s>  the only regret has been that such a course should be right and that the other thing should be wrong</s>  poor man</s>  we have not seen him yet nor heard from him</s>  frank says that he will take it very badly</s>  i suppose that men do always get over that kind of thing much quicker than women do</s>  many women never can get over it at all and harry gilmore though there is so little about him that seems to be soft is in this respect more like a woman than a man</s>  had he been otherwise and had only half cared for you and asked you to be his wife as though your taking him were a thing he didnt much care about and were quite a matter of course i believe you would have been up at hampton privets this moment instead of going soldiering with a captain</s>  frank bids me send you his kindest love and his best wishes for your happiness</s>  those are his very words and they seem to be kinder than mine</s>  of course you have my love and my best wishes but i do not know how to write as though i could rejoice with you</s>  your husband will always be dear to us whoever he may be if he be good to you</s>  at present i feel very very angry with captain marrable as though i wish he had had his head blown off in battle</s>  however if he is to be the happy man i will open my heart to himthat is if he be good</s>  i know this is not nice but i cannot make it nicer now</s>  god bless you dearest mary</s>  ever your most affectionate friend janet fenwick</s> the letter was not posted till the hour for despatch on the followingday but up to that hour nothing had been seen at the vicarage ofmr</s>  gilmore</s> chapter xxiii</s> what mr</s>  gilmore thought about it</s> mr</s>  gilmore was standing on the doorsteps of his own house whenmarys letter was brought to him</s>  it was a modestsized countrygentlemans residence built of variegated uneven stones black andgrey and white which seemed to be chiefly flint but the cornersand settings of the windows and of the doorways and the chimneyswere of brick</s>  there was something sombre about it and many perhapsmight call it dull of aspect but it was substantial comfortableand unassuming</s>  it was entered by broad stone steps with ironbalustrades curving outwards as they descended and there was an openarea round the house showing that the offices were in the basement</s> in these days it was a quiet house enough as mr</s>  gilmore was a mannot much given to the loudness of bachelor parties</s>  he entertainedhis neighbours at dinner perhaps once a month and occasionallyhad a few guests staying with him</s>  his uncle the prebendary fromsalisbury was often with him and occasionally a brother who was inthe army</s>  for the present however he was much more inclined whenin want of society to walk off to the vicarage than to provide itfor himself at home</s>  when marys letter was handed to him with histimes and other correspondence he looked as everybody does atthe address and at once knew that it came from mary lowther</s>  hehad never hitherto received a letter from her but yet he knew herhandwriting well</s>  without waiting a moment he turned upon his heeland went back into his house and through the hall to the library</s> when there he first opened three other letters two from tradesmenin london and one from his uncle offering to come to him on thenext monday</s>  then he opened the times and cut it and put it downon the table</s>  marys letter meanwhile was in his hand and anyonestanding by might have thought that he had forgotten it</s>  but hehad not forgotten it nor was it out of his mind for a moment</s> while looking at the other letters while cutting the paper whileattempting as he did to read the news he was suffering under thedread of the blow that was coming</s>  he was there for twenty minutesbefore he dared to break the envelope and though during the whole ofthat time he pretended to deceive himself by some employment he knewthat he was simply postponing an evil thing that was coming to him</s> at last he cut the letter open and stood for some moments lookingfor courage to read it</s>  he did read it and then sat himself down inhis chair telling himself that the thing was over and that he wouldbear it as a man</s>  he took up his newspaper and began to study it</s>  itwas the time of the year when newspapers are not very interestingbut he made a rush at the leading articles and went through two ofthem</s>  then he turned over to the police reports</s>  he sat there for anhour and read hard during the whole time</s>  then he got up and shookhimself and knew that he was a crippled man with every function outof order disabled in every limb</s>  he walked from the library into thehall and thence to the diningroom and so backwards and forwardsfor a quarter of an hour</s>  at last he could walk no longer andclosing the door of the library behind him he threw himself on asofa and cried like a woman</s> what was it that he wanted and why did he want it</s>  were there notother women whom the world would say were as good</s>  was it ever knownthat a man had died or become irretrievably broken and destroyed bydisappointed love</s>  was it not one of those things that a man shouldshake off from him and have done with it</s>  he asked himself theseand many suchlike questions and tried to philosophise with himselfon the matter</s>  had he no will of his own by which he might conquerthis enemy</s>  no he had no will of his own and the enemy would not beconquered</s>  he had to tell himself that he was so poor a thing that hecould not stand up against the evil that had fallen on him</s> he walked out round his shrubberies and paddocks and tried to takean interest in the bullocks and the horses</s>  he knew that if everybullock and horse about the place had been struck dead it would notenhance his misery</s>  he had not had much hope before but now he wouldhave seen the house of hampton privets in flames just for the chancethat had been his yesterday</s>  it was not only that he wanted her orthat he regretted the absence of some recognised joys which she wouldhave brought to him but that the final decision on her part seemedto take from him all vitality all power of enjoyment all thatinward elasticity which is necessary for an interest in worldlyaffairs</s> he had as yet hardly thought of anything but himselfhad hardlyobserved the name of his successful rival or paid any attention toaught but the fact that she had told him that it was all over</s>  hehad not attempted to make up his mind whether anything could stillbe done whether he might yet have a chance whether it would bewell for him to quarrel with the man whether he should be indignantwith her or remonstrate once again in regard to her cruelty</s>  he hadthought only of the blow and of his inability to support it</s>  wouldit not be best that he should go forth and blow out his brains andhave done with it</s> he did not look at the letter again till he had returned to thelibrary</s>  then he took it from his pocket and read it very carefully</s> yes she had been quick about it</s>  why how long had it been since shehad left their parish</s>  it was still october and she had been therejust before the murderonly the other day</s>  captain walter marrable</s> no he didnt think he had ever heard of him</s>  some fellow with

light as this that mr</s>  gilmore at present regarded captainmarrable</s>  how could such a man make a woman happya fellow whoprobably had no house nor home in which to make her comfortable</s> staying with his uncle the clergyman</s>  poor gilmore expressed awish that the uncle the clergyman had been choked before he hadentertained such a guest</s>  then he read the concluding sentence ofpoor marys letter in which she expressed a hope that they might befriends</s>  was there ever such coldblooded trash</s>  friends indeed</s>  whatsort of friendship could there be between two persons one of whomhad made the other so wretchedso dead as was he at present</s> for some halfhour he tried to comfort himself with an idea that hecould get hold of captain marrable and maul him that it would be athing permissible for him a magistrate to go forth with a whip andflog the man and then perhaps shoot him because the man had beenfortunate in love where he had been unfortunate</s>  but he knew theworld in which he lived too well to allow himself long to think thatthis could really be done</s>  it might be that it would be a betterworld were such revenge practicable in it but as he well knew itwas not practicable now and if mary lowther chose to give herself tothis accursed captain he could not help it</s>  there was nothing thathe could do but to go away and chafe at his suffering in some part ofthe world in which nobody would know that he was chafing</s> when the evening came and he found that his solitude was terriblyoppressive to him he thought that he would go down to the vicarage</s> he had been told by that false one that her tidings had been sent toher friend</s>  he took his hat and sauntered out across the fields anddid walk as far as the churchyard

man in the want of success in love</s>  if aman lose a venture of money he can tell his friend or if he beunsuccessful in trying for a seat in parliament or be thrown out ofa run in the huntingfield

in thefens there was not much to prick his conscience as he gave up theparsonage house and twothirds of the income to his curate expendingthe other third on local charities</s>  perhaps the argument

true that as yet this full blown iniquity had spreaditself only among the comparatively small number of tenants belongingto the objectionable person who unfortunately owned a small numberof acres in his lordships parishbut his lordships tenant hadbeen murdered</s>  and with such a pastor in the parish and such anobjectionable person owning acres to back the pastor might it notbe expected that all his tenants would be murdered</s>  many applicationshad already been made to the marquis for the church farm but as ithappened that the applicant whom the marquis intended to favour haddeclared that

the bishop till he washalf dressed and then burst out into loud laughter as he read it</s> what is it frank</s>  asked his wife through the open door of her ownroom</s> heres such a game said he</s>  never mind lets have dinner andthen you shall see it</s>  the reader however may be quite sure thatmrs</s>  fenwick did not wait till dinner was served before she knew thenature of the game</s> the bishops letter to the vicar was very short and very rationaland it was not that which made the vicar laugh but inside thebishops letter was that from the marquis</s>  my dear mr</s>  fenwicksaid the bishop after a good deal of consideration i have determined to send you the enclosed</s>  i do so because i have made it a rule never to receive an accusation against one of my clergy without sending it to the person accused</s>  you will of course perceive that it alludes to some matter which lies outside of my control and right of inquiry but perhaps you will allow me as a friend to suggest to you that it is always well for a parish clergyman to avoid controversy and quarrel with his neighbours and that it is especially expedient that he should be on good terms with those who have influence in his parish</s>  perhaps you will forgive me if i add that a spirit of pugnacity though no doubt it may lead to much that is good has its bad tendencies if not watched closely</s>  pray remember that lord trowbridge is a worthy man doing his duty on the whole well and that his position though it be entitled to no veneration is entitled to much respect</s>  if you can tell me that you will feel no grudge against him for what has taken place i shall be very happy</s>  you will observe that i have been careful that this letter shall have no official character</s>  yours very faithfully c</s>  c</s>  c</s> the letter was answered that evening but before the answer waswritten the marquis of trowbridge was discussed between the husbandand wife not in complimentary terms</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick on the occasionwas more pugnacious than her husband</s>  she could not forgive the manwho had hinted to the bishop that her husband held his living fromunworthy motives and that he was a bad clergyman</s> my dear girl said fenwick what can you expect from an ass buthis ears</s> i dont expect downright slander from such a man as the marquis oftrowbridge and if i were you i should tell the bishop so</s> i shall tell him nothing of the kind</s>  i shall write about themarquis with the kindliest feelings</s> but you dont feel kindly</s> yes i do</s>  the poor old idiot has nobody to keep him right and doesthe best he can according to his lights</s>  i have no doubt he thinksthat i am everything that is horrid</s>  i am not a bit angry with himand would be as civil to him tomorrow as my nature would allow meif he would only be civil to me</s> then he wrote his letter which will complete the correspondence andwhich he dated for the following day bullhampton vicarage oct</s>  23 186</s>  my dear lord bishop i return the marquiss letter with many thanks</s>  i can assure you that i take in proper spirit your little hints as to my pugnacity of disposition and will endeavour to profit by them</s>  my wife tells me that i am given to combativeness and i have no doubt that she is right</s>  as to lord trowbridge i can assure your lordship that i will not bear any malice against him or even think ill of him because of his complaint</s>  he and i probably differ in opinion about almost everything and he is one of those who pity the condition of all who are so blinded as to differ from him</s>  the next time that i am thrown into his company i shall act exactly as though no such letter had been written and as if no such meeting had taken place as that which he describes</s>  i hope i may be allowed to assure your lordship without any reference to my motives for keeping it that i shall be very slow to give up a living in your lordships diocese</s>  as your letter to me is unofficialand i thank you heartily for sending it in such formi have ventured to reply in the same strain</s>  i am my dear lord bishop your very faithful servant francis fenwick</s> there said he as he folded it and handed it to his wife ishall never see the remainder of the series</s>  i would give a shillingto know how the bishop gets out of it in writing to the marquisand halfacrown to see the marquiss rejoinder</s>  the reader shallbe troubled with neither as he would hardly price them so high asdid the vicar</s>  the bishops letter really contained little beyondan assurance on his part that mr</s>  fenwick had not meant anythingwrong and that the matter was one with which he the bishop had noconcern all which was worded with most complete episcopal courtesy</s> the rejoinder of the marquis was long elaborate and very pompous</s> he did not exactly scold the bishop but he expressed very plainlyhis opinion that the church of england was going to the dogs becausea bishop had not the power of utterly abolishing any clergyman whomight be guilty of an offence against so distinguished a person asthe marquis of trowbridge</s> but what was to be done about carry brattle</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick whenshe had expressed her anger against the marquis was quite readyto own that the matter of carrys position was to them of muchgreater moment than the wrath of the peer</s>  how were they to putout their hands and save that brand from the burning</s>  fenwick inhis illconsidered zeal suggested that she might be brought tothe vicarage but his wife at once knew that such a step would bedangerous in every way</s>  how could she live and what would she do</s> and what would the other servants think of it</s> why would the other servants mind it</s>  asked fenwick</s>  but his wifeon such a matter could have a way of her own and that project wassoon knocked on the head</s>  no doubt her fathers house was the properplace for her but then her father was so dour a man</s> upon my word said the vicar he is the only person in the worldof whom i believe myself to be afraid</s>  when i get at him i do notspeak to him as i would to another and of course he knows it</s> nevertheless if anything was to be done for carry brattle it seemedas though it must be done by her fathers permission and assistance</s> there can be no doubt that it is his duty said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> i will not say that as a certainty said the husband</s>  there is apoint at which i presume a father may be justified in disowning achild</s>  the possession of such a power no doubt keeps others fromgoing wrong</s>  what one wants is that a father should be presumedto have the power but that when the time comes he should neveruse it</s>  it is the comfortable doctrine which we are all of usteachingwrath and abomination of the sinner before the sinpardon and love after it</s>  if you were to run away from me janetfrank do not dare to speak of anything so horrible</s> i should say now probably that were you to do so i would neverblast my eyes by looking at you again but i know that i should runafter you and implore you to come back to me</s> you wouldnt do anything of the kind and it isnt proper to talkabout it and i shall go to bed</s> it is very difficult to make crooked things straight said thevicar as he walked about the room after his wife had left him</s>  isuppose she ought to go into a reformatory</s>  but i know she wouldntand i shouldnt like to ask her after what she said</s> it is probably the case that mr</s>  fenwick would have been able to dohis duty better had some harsher feeling towards the sinner beenmixed with his charity</s> chapter xxvii</s> i never shamed none of them</s> something must be done about carry brattle at once</s>  the vicar feltthat he had pledged himself to take some steps for her welfare andit seemed to him as he thought of the matter that there were onlytwo steps possible</s>  he might intercede with her father or he mightuse his influence to have her received into some house of correctionsome retreat in which she might be kept from evil and disciplinedfor good</s>  he knew that the latter would be the safer plan if itcould be brought to bear and it would certainly be the easier forhimself</s>  but he thought that he had almost pledged himself to thegirl not to attempt it and he felt sure that she would not accedeto it</s>  in his doubt he went up to his friend gilmore intending toobtain the light of his friends wisdom</s>  he found the squire and theprebendary together and at once started his subject</s> youll do no good mr</s>  fenwick said mr</s>  chamberlaine after thetwo younger men had been discussing the matter for half an hour</s> do you mean that i ought not to try to do any good</s> i mean that such efforts never come to anything</s> all the unfortunate creatures in the world then should be left togo to destruction in their own way</s> it is useless i think to treat special cases in an exceptionalmanner</s>  when such is done it is done from enthusiasm and enthusiasmis never useful</s> what ought a man to do then for the assistance of suchfellowcreatures as this poor girl</s>  asked the vicar</s> there are penitentiaries and reformatories and it is well nodoubt to subscribe to them said the prebendary</s>  the subject is sofull of difficulty that one should not touch it rashly</s>  henry whereis the last quarterly</s> i never take it sir</s> i ought to have remembered said mr</s>  chamberlaine smiling blandly</s> then he took up the saturday review and endeavoured to contenthimself with that</s> gilmore and fenwick walked down to the mill together it beingunderstood that the squire was not to show himself there</s>  fenwicksdifficult task if it were to be done at all must be done by himselfalone</s>  he must beard the lion in his den and make the attack withoutany assistant</s>  gilmore had upon the whole been disposed to thinkthat no such attack should be made</s>  hell only turn upon you withviolence and no good will be done said he</s>  he cant eat mefenwick had replied acknowledging however that he approached theundertaking with fear and trembling</s>  before they were far from thehouse gilmore had changed the conversation and fallen back upon hisown sorrows</s>  he had not answered marys letter and now declaredthat he did not intend to do so</s>  what could he say to her</s>  hecould not write and profess friendship he could not offer herhis congratulations he could not belie his heart by affectingindifference</s>  she had thrown

everything is tiresome to me</s>  i dont thinkanything else can be so tiresome as my uncle and yet i dread hisleaving mewhen i shall be alone</s>  i suppose if one was out amongthe rocky mountains one

lived</s> i dont see what good you can do harry said the vicar</s>  and sothey parted</s> fenwick was about half a mile from the mill when gilmore left himand he wished that it were a mile and a half</s>  he knew well that anedict had gone forth at the mill that no one should speak to the oldman about his daughter</s>  with the mother the vicar had often spokenof her lost child and had learned from her how sad it was to herthat she could never dare to mention carrys name to her husband</s>  hehad cursed his child and had sworn that she should never more havepart in him or his</s>  she had brought sorrow and shame upon him andhe had cut her off with a steady resolve that there should be noweak backsliding on his part</s>  those who knew him best declared thatthe miller would certainly keep his word and hitherto no one haddared to speak of the lost one in her fathers hearing</s>  all this mr</s> fenwick knew and he knew also that the man was one who could be veryfierce in his anger</s>  he had told his wife that old brattle was theonly man in the world before whom he would be afraid to speak hismind openly and in so saying he had expressed a feeling that wasvery general throughout all bullhampton</s>  mr</s>  puddleham was a verymeddlesome man and he had once ventured out to the mill to say aword not indeed about carry but touching some youthful iniquity ofwhich sam was supposed to have been guilty</s>  he never went near themill again but would shudder and lift up his hands and his eyes whenthe millers name was mentioned</s>  it was not that brattle used roughlanguage or became violently angry when accosted but there was asullen sternness about the man and a capability of asserting his ownmastery and personal authority which reduced those who attacked himto the condition of vanquished combatants and repulsed them so thatthey would retreat as beaten dogs</s>  mr</s>  fenwick indeed had alwaysbeen well received at the mill</s>  the women of the family loved himdearly and took great comfort in his visits</s>  from his first arrivalin the parish he had been on intimate terms with them though the oldman had never once entered his church</s>  brattle himself would bearwith him more kindly than he would with his own landlord who mightat any day have turned him out of his holding</s>  but even fenwick hadbeen so answered more than once as to have been forced to retreatwith that feeling of having his tail like a cur between his legs</s> he cant eat me he said to himself as the low willows round themill came in sight</s>  when a man is reduced to that consolation asmany a man often is he may be nearly sure that he will be eaten</s> when he got over the stile into the lane close to the milldoorhe found that the mill was going</s>  gilmore had told him that itmight probably be so as he had heard that the repairs were nearlyfinished</s>  fenwick was sure that after so long a period of enforcedidleness brattle would be in the mill but he went at first intothe house and there found mrs</s>  brattle and fanny</s>  even with them hehardly felt himself to be at home but after a while managed to ask afew questions about sam</s>  sam had come back and was now at work buthe had had some terribly hard words with his father</s>  the old man haddesired to know where his son had been</s>  sam had declined to tell andhad declared that if he was to be crossquestioned about his comingsand goings he would leave the mill altogether</s>  his father had toldhim that he had better go</s>  sam had not gone but the two had beenworking on together since without interchanging a word</s>  i want tosee him especially said mr</s>  fenwick</s> you mean sam sir</s>  asked the mother</s> no his father</s>  i will go out into the lane and perhaps fanny willask him to come to me</s>  mrs</s>  brattle immediately became dismayed by atroop of fears and looked up into his face with soft supplicatingtearful eyes</s>  so much of sorrow had come to her of late</s>  there isnothing wrong mrs</s>  brattle he said</s> i thought perhaps you had heard something of sam</s> nothing but what has made me surer than ever that he had no part inwhat was done at mr</s>  trumbulls farm</s> thank god for that</s>  said the mother taking him by the hand</s>  thenfanny went into the mill and the vicar followed her out of thehouse on to the lane</s>  he stood leaning against a tree till the oldman came to him</s>  he then shook the millers hand and made someremark about the mill</s>  they had begun again that morning the millersaid</s>  sam had been off again or they might have been at work onyesterday forenoon</s> do not be angry with him he has been on a good work said thevicar</s> good or bad i know nowt of it said the miller</s> i know and if you wish i will tell you but there is anotherthing i must say first</s>  come a little way down the lane with me mr</s> brattle</s> the vicar had assumed a tone which was almost one of rebukenotintending it but falling into it from want of histrionic power inhis attempt to be bold and solemn at the same time</s>  the miller atonce resented it</s>  why should i come down the lane</s>  said he</s>  youreaxing me to come out at a very busy moment muster fenwick</s> nothing can be so important as that which i have to say</s>  for thelove of god mr</s>  brattlefor the love you bear

the miller arresting his step</s> your daughter carry mr</s>  brattle</s>  then the old man turned round andwould have hurried back to the mill without a word but the vicarheld him by his coat</s>  if i have ever been a friend to you or yourslisten to me now one minute</s> do i come to your house and tell you of your sorrows and your shame</s> let me go</s> mr</s>  brattle if you will stretch forth

streets not because she has fallen but because shehas hurt you in her fall</s>  is that to be a father</s>  is that to be aman</s>  mr</s>  brattle think better of yourself and dare to obey theinstincts of your heart</s> but by this time the miller had escaped and was striding off infurious silence to the mill</s>  the vicar oppressed by a sense of utterfailure feeling that his interference had been absolutely valuelessthat the mans wrath and constancy were things altogether beyond hisreach stood where he had been left hardly daring to return to themill and say a word or two to the women there</s>  but at last he didgo back</s>  he knew well that brattle himself would not be seen in thehouse till his present mood was over</s>  after any encounter of wordshe would go and work in silence for half a day and would seldom ornever refer again to what had taken place he would never so thoughtthe vicar refer to the encounter which had just taken place but hewould remember it always and it might be that he would never againspeak in friendship to a man who had offended him so deeply</s> after a moments thought he determined to tell the wife and informedher and fanny that he had seen carry over at pycroft common</s>  themothers questions as to what her child was doing how she wasliving whether she were ill or well and alas</s>  whether she werehappy or miserable who

know wellenough where you was gone to</s> mr</s>  fenwick said that he would think of it and let fanny know onthe following sunday</s>  he would not make a promise now and at anyrate he could not go before sunday</s>  he did not like to pledge himselfsuddenly to such an adventure knowing that it would be best that heshould first have his wifes ideas on the matter</s>  then he took hisleave and as he went out of the house he saw the miller standing atthe door of the mill</s>  he raised his hand and said goodbye butthe miller quickly turned his back to him and retreated into hismill</s> as he walked up to his house through the village he met mr</s> puddleham</s>  so sam brattle is off again sir said the minister</s> off what mr</s>  puddleham</s> gone clean away</s>  out of the country</s>

fenwick would drive her mother over to pycroft common</s>  he had nodoubt he said but that carry would still be found living with mrs</s> burrows</s>  he explained that the old woman had luckily been

thingsthat hewould start off and travel for four or five years and that he wouldpay a visit to loring</s>  fenwick had advised him to do neither but tostay at home and dig and say his prayers</s>  but in such emergenciesno man takes his friends advice and when mr</s>  chamberlaine hadleft him gilmore had made up his mind that he would at any rate goto loring</s>  he went to church on the sunday morning and was halfresolved to tell mrs</s>  fenwick of his purpose but chance delayed herin the church and he sauntered away home without having mentionedit</s>  he let half the next week pass by without stirring beyond hisown ground</s>  during those three days he changed his mind half a dozentimes but at last on the thursday he had his portmanteau packedand started on his journey</s>  as he was preparing to leave the househe wrote one line to fenwick in pencil</s>  i am this moment off toloring</s> h</s>  g</s>  this he left in the village as he drove through tothe westbury station</s> he had formed no idea in his own mind of any definite purpose ingoing</s>  he did not know what he should do or what say when he got toloring</s>  he had told himself a hundred times that any persecution ofthe girl on his part would be mean and unworthy of him</s>  and he wasalso aware that no condition in which a man could place himself wasmore open to contempt than that of a whining pining unsuccessfullover</s>  a man is bound to take a womans decision against him bearit as he may and say as little against it as possible</s>  he is boundto do so when he is convinced that a womans decision is final andthere can be no stronger proof of such finality than the fact thatshe has declared a preference for some other man</s>  all this gilmoreknew but he would not divest himself of the idea that there mightstill be some turn in the wheel of fortune</s>  he had heard a vaguerumour that captain marrable his rival was a very dangerous man</s> his uncle was quite sure that the captains father was thoroughlybad and had thrown out hints against the son which gilmore in hisanxiety magnified till he felt convinced that the girl whom he lovedwith all his heart was going to throw herself into the arms of athorough scamp</s>  could he not do something if not for his own sakethen for hers</s>  might it not be possible for him to deliver her fromher danger</s>  what if he should discover some great iniquitywouldshe not then in her gratitude be softened towards him</s>  it was onthe cards that this reprobate was married already and was aboutto commit bigamy</s>  it was quite probable that such a man should bedeeply in debt</s>  as for the fortune that had been left to him mr</s> chamberlaine had already ascertained that that amounted to nothing</s> it had been consumed to the last shilling in paying the joint debtsof the father and son</s>  men such as mr</s>  chamberlaine have sources ofinformation which are marvellous to the minds of those who are moresecluded and not the less marvellous because the information isinvariably false</s>  gilmore in this way almost came to a convictionthat mary lowther was about to sacrifice herself to a man utterlyunworthy of her and he taught himself not to thinkbut to believeit to be possible that he might save her</s>  those who knew him wouldhave said that he was the last man in the world to be carried awayby a romantic notionbut he had his own idea of romance as plainlydeveloped in his mind as was ever the case with a knight of old whowent forth for the relief of a distressed damsel</s>  if he could doanything towards saving her he would do it or try to do it thoughhe should be brought to ruin in the attempt</s>  might it not be that atlast he would have the reward which other knights always attained</s> the chance in his favour was doubtless small but the world wasnothing to him without this chance</s> he had never been at loring before but he had learned the way</s>  hewent to chippenham and swindon and then by the train to loring</s>  hehad no very definite plan formed for himself</s>  he rather thought thathe would call at miss marrables housecall if possible when marylowther was not thereand learn from the elder lady something ofthe facts of the case</s>  he had been well aware for many weeks pastfrom early days in the summer that old miss marrable had been infavour of his claim</s>  he had heard too that there had been familyquarrels among the marrables and a word had been dropped in hishearing by mrs</s>  fenwick which had implied that miss marrable wasby no means pleased with the match which her niece mary lowther wasproposing to herself</s>  everything seemed to show that captain marrablewas a most undesirable person</s> when he reached the station at loring it was incumbent on him to gosomewhither at once</s>  he must provide for himself for the night</s>  hefound two omnibuses at the station and two inn servants competingwith great ardour for his carpet bag</s>  there were the dragon and thebull fighting for him</s>  the bull in the lowtown was commercial andprosperous</s>  the dragon at uphill was aristocratic devoted to countypurposes and rather hard set to keep its jaws open and its tailflying</s>  prosperity is always becoming more prosperous and theallurements of the bull prevailed</s>  are you a going to rob the gentof his walise</s>  said the indignant boots of the bull as he rescuedmr</s>  gilmores property from the hands of his natural enemy as soonas he had secured the entrance of mr</s>  gilmore into his own vehicle</s> had mr</s>  gilmore known that the dragon was next door but one to missmarrables house and that the bull was nearly equally contiguousto that in which captain marrable was residing his choice probablywould not have been altered</s>  in such cases the knight who is to bethe deliverer desires above all things that he may be near to hisenemy</s> he was shown up to a bedroom and then ushered into the commercialroom of the house</s>  loring though it does a very pretty trade as asmall town and now has for some years been regarded as a thrivingplace in its degree is not of such importance in the way of businessas to support a commercial inn of the first class</s>  at such houses thecommercial room is as much closed against the uninitiated as is afirstclass club in london</s>  in such rooms a noncommercial man wouldbe almost as much astray as is a nonbroker in capel court or anattorney in a bar messroom</s>  at the bull things were a little mixed</s> the very fact that the words commercial room were painted on thedoor proved to those who understood such matters that there was adoubt in the case</s>  they had no coffee room at the bull and strangerswho came that way were of necessity shown into that in which thegentlemen of the road were wont to relax themselves</s>  certaincommercial laws are maintained in such apartments</s>  cigars are notallowed before nine oclock except upon some distinct arrangementwith the waiter</s>  there is not as a rule a regular daily commercialrepast but when three or more gentlemen dine together at fiveoclock the dinner becomes a commercial dinner and the commerciallaws as to wine c</s>  are enforced with more or less restriction ascircumstances may seem to demand</s>  at the present time there was butone occupant of the chamber to greet mr</s>  gilmore when he enteredand this greeting was made with all the full honours of commercialcourtesy</s>  the commercial gentleman is of his nature gregarious andalthough he be exclusive to a strong degree more so probably thanalmost any other man in regard to the sacred hour of dinner whenin the full glory of his confraternity he will condescend whenthe circumstances of his profession have separated him from hisprofessional brethren to be festive with almost any gentleman whomchance may throw in his way</s>  mr</s>  cockey had been alone for a wholeday when gilmore arrived having reached loring just twentyfourhours in advance of our friend and was contemplating the sadlydiminished joys of a second solitary dinner at the bull when fortunethrew this stranger in his way</s>  the waiter looking at the matter ina somewhat similar light and aware that a combined meal would be forthe advantage of all parties very soon assisted mr</s>  cockey in makinghis arrangements for the evening</s>  mr</s>  gilmore would no doubt want todine</s>  dinner would be served at five oclock</s>  mr</s>  cockey was going todine and mr</s>  gilmore the waiter thought would probably be glad tojoin him</s>  mr</s>  cockey expressed himself as delighted and would onlybe too happy</s>  now men in love let their case be ever so bad mustdine or die</s>  so much no doubt is not admitted by the chroniclersof the old knights who went forth after their ladies but theold chroniclers if they soared somewhat higher than do thoseof the present day are admitted to have been on the whole lesscircumstantially truthful</s>  our knight was very sad at heart andwould have done according to his prowess as much as any orlando ofthem all for the lady whom he lovedbut nevertheless he was anhungered the mention of dinner was pleasant to him and he acceptedthe joint courtesies of mr</s>  cockey and the waiter with gratitude</s> the codfish and beefsteak though somewhat woolly and tough werewholesome and the pint of sherry which at mr</s>  cockeys suggestionwas supplied to them if not of itself wholesome was innocentby reason of its dimensions</s>  mr</s>  cockey himself was pleasant andcommunicative and told mr</s>  gilmore a good deal about loring</s>  ourfriend was afraid to ask any leading questions as to the persons inthe place who interested himself feeling conscious that his ownsubject was one which would not bear touch from a rough hand</s>  he didat last venture to make inquiry about the clergyman of the parish</s> mr</s>  cockey with some merriment at his own wit declared that thechurch was a house of business at which he did not often call fororders</s>  though he had been coming to loring now for four years hehad never heard anything of the clergyman but the waiter no doubtwould tell them</s>  gilmore rather hesitated and protested that hecared little for the matter but the waiter was called in andquestioned and was soon full of stories about old mr</s>  marrable</s>  hewas a good sort of man in his way the waiter thought but not muchof a preacher</s>  the people liked him because he never interfered withthem</s>  he dont go poking his nose into peoples ouses like someof em said the waiter who then began to tell of the pertinacityin that respect of a younger clergyman at uphill</s>  yes parsonmarrable had a relation living at uphill an old lady</s>  no nothis grandmother</s>  this was in answer to a joke on the part of mr</s> cockey</s>  nor yet a daughter</s>  the waiter thought she was some kind ofa cousin though he did not know what kind</s>  a very grand lady wasmiss marrable according to his showing and much thought of by thequality</s>  there was a young lady living with her though the waiterdid not know the young ladys name</s> does the rev</s>  mr</s>  marrable live alone</s>  asked gilmore</s>  well yesfor the most part quite alone</s>  but just at present he had a visitor</s> then the waiter told all that he knew about the captain</s>  the mostmaterial part of this was that the captain had returned from londonthat very eveninghad come in by the express while the two gentswere at dinner and had been taken to the lowtown parsonage by thebull bus</s>  quite the gentleman was the captain according to thewaiter and one of the handsomest gents as ever hed set his eyesupon</s>  d him said poor harry gilmore to himself</s>  then heventured upon another question</s>  did the waiter know anything ofcaptain marrables father</s>  the waiter only knew that the captainsfather was a military gent and was high up in the army</s>  from allwhich the only information which gilmore received was the fact thatthe match between marrable and mary lowther had not as yet become thetalk of the town</s>  after dinner mr</s>  cockey proposed a glass of toddyand a cigar remarking that he would move a bill for dispensingwith the smoking rule for that night only and to this also gilmoreassented</s>  now that he was at loring he did not know what to do withhimself better than drinking toddy with mr</s>  cockey</s>  mr</s>  cockeydeclared the bill to be carried nem</s>  con</s>  and the cigars and toddywere produced</s>  mr</s>  cockey remarked that he had heard of sir gregorymarrable of dunripple park</s>  he travelled in warwickshire and was inthe habit as he said of fishing up little facts</s>  sir gregory wasntmuch of a man according to his account</s>  the estate was small andas mr</s>  cockey fancied a little out at elbows</s>  mr</s>  cockey thought itall very well to be a country gentleman and a barrow knight as hecalled it as long as you had an estate to follow but he thoughtvery little of a title without plenty of stuff</s>  commerce accordingto his notions was the back bone of the nationand that the corpsof travelling commercial gentlemen was the back bone of trade everychild knew</s>  mr</s>  cockey became warm and friendly as he drank histoddy</s>  now i dont know what you are sir said he</s> im not very much of anything said gilmore</s> perhaps not sir</s>  let that be as it may</s>  but a man sir that feelsthat hes one of the supports of the commercial supremacy of thisnation aint got much reason to be ashamed of himself</s> not on that account certainly</s> nor yet on no other account as long as hes true to his employers</s> now you talk of country gentlemen</s> i didnt talk of them said gilmore</s> wellnoyou didnt but they do you know</s>  what does a countrygentleman know and what does he do</s>  whats the country the better ofhim</s>  he unts and he shoots and he goes to bed with his skin fullof wine and then he gets up and he unts and he shoots again andas his skin full once more</s>  thats about all</s> sometimes hes a magistrate</s> yes

but as for capital and investment they know nothing aboutit</s>  after all they aint getting above twoandahalf per cent</s>  fortheir money</s>  we all know what that must come to</s> mr</s>  cockey had been so mild before the pint of sherry and the glassof toddy that mr</s>  gilmore was somewhat dismayed by the change</s>  mr</s> cockey however in his altered aspect seemed to be so much the lessgracious that gilmore left him and strolled out into the town</s>  heclimbed up the hill and walked round the church and looked up at thewindows of miss marrables house of which he had learned the sitebut he had no adventure saw nothing that interested him and athalfpast nine took himself wearily to bed</s> that same day captain marrable had run down from london to loringladen with terrible news</s>  the money on which he had counted was allgone</s>

thebreakfast at the parsonage passed by in silence</s>  parson john had beenthinking a good deal of mary but had resolved that it was best thathe should hold his tongue for the present</s>  from the moment in whichhe had first heard of the engagement he had made up his mind thathis nephew and mary lowther would never be married</s>  seeing whathis nephew wasor rather seeing that which he fancied

found now witha vengeance</s>  immediately after breakfast the captain took his hatwithout a word and walked steadily up the hill to uphill lane</s>  ashe passed the door of the bull he saw but took no notice of agentleman who was standing under the covered entrance to the inn andwho had watched him coming out from the parsonage gate but gilmorethe moment that his eyes fell upon the captain

study</s>  she did not doubt but that he was good and true andnobleminded but it might be possible that a man good true andnobleminded might have lived with so many indulgences around himas to be

in spite of his conscience</s>  he was a much older man thanmr</s>  fenwick having been for thirty years in the ministry and he hadalways previously enjoyed the privilege of being on bad terms withthe clergyman of the establishment</s>  it had been his glory to be apoacher on another mans manor to filch souls as it were out ofthe keeping of a pastor of a higher grade than himself to say severethings of the short comings of an endowed clergyman and to obtainrecognition of his position by the activity of his operations in theguise of a blister</s>  our vicar understanding something of

licit following ofgame but a man cant poach if the right of shooting be accorded tohim</s>  mr</s>  puddleham had not been quite happy in his mind amidst theease and amiable relations which mr</s>  fenwick enforced upon him andhad long since begun to feel that a few cabbages and peaches did notrepay him for the loss of those pleasant and bitter things which itwould have been his to say in his daily walks and from the pulpit ofhis salem had he not been thus hampered confined and dominated</s> hitherto he had hardly gained a single soul from under mr</s>  fenwicksgrasphad indeed on the

to be hardly anybody at all because he was at peace with thevicar of the parish in which he was established</s>  his eyes had beenbecoming gradually open to all this for years and when he had beenpresent at the bitter quarrel between the vicar and the marquishe had at once told himself that now was his opportunity</s>  he hadintended to express a clear opinion to mr</s>  fenwick that he mr</s> fenwick had been very wrong in speaking to the marquis as he hadspoken and as he was walking out of the farmhouse he was preparingsome words as to the respect due to those in authority</s>  it happenedhowever that at that moment the wind was taken out of his sails bya strange comparison which the vicar made to him between the sinsof them two ministers of god as they were and the sins of carrybrattle</s>  mr</s>  puddleham at the moment had been cowed and quelled</s>  hewas not quite able to carry himself in the vicars presence as thoughhe were the vicars equal</s>  but the desire for a quarrel remainedand when it was suggested to him by mr</s>  packer the marquiss man ofbusiness that the green opposite to the vicarage gate would be aconvenient site for his chapel and that the marquis was ready todouble his beforeproffered subscription then he saw plainly thatthe moment had come and that it was fitting that he should gird uphis loins and return all future cabbages to the proud donor</s> mr</s>  puddleham had his eye keenly set on the scene of his futureministration and was aware of grimess default almost as soon asthat man with his myrmidons had left the ground</s>  he at once went togrimes with heavy denunciations with threats of the marquis andwith urgent explanation as to the necessity of instant work</s>  butgrimes was obdurate</s>  the vicar had asked him to

opinion any placefor anybody to live in</s>  mr</s>  puddleham argued the matter out but heargued in vain</s>  mr</s>  grimes declared that there was time enough andthat he would have the work finished by the time fixedunlessindeed the marquis should change his mind</s>  mr</s>  puddleham regardedthis as a most improbable supposition</s>  the marquis doesnt changehis mind mr</s>  grimes he said and then he walked forth from mr</s> grimess house with much offence</s> by this time all bullhampton knew of the quarrelknew of italthough mr</s>  fenwick had been so very careful to guard himself fromany quarrelling at all</s>  he had not spoken a word in anger on thesubject to anyone but his wife and in making his request to grimeshad done so with hypocritical good humour</s>  but nevertheless he wasaware that the parish was becoming hot about it and when he sat downto write his letter to the marquis he was almost minded to give upthe idea of writing to return to grimes and to allow the measuringand sodturning to be continued</s>  why should a place of worshipopposite to his gate be considered by him as an injury</s>  why shouldthe psalmsinging of christian brethren hurt his ears as he walkedabout his garden</s>  and if through the infirmity of his nature hiseyes and his ears were hurt what was that to the great purport forwhich he had been sent into the parish</s>  was he not about to createenmity by his opposition and was it not his special duty to fosterlove and goodwill among his people</s>  after all he within his ownvicarage grounds had all that it was intended that he shouldpossess and that he held very firmly</s>  poor mr</s>  puddleham had no suchfirm holding and why should he quarrel with mr</s>  puddleham becausethat illpaid preacher sought to strengthen the ground on which hissalem stood</s> as he paused however to think of all this there came upon him theconviction that in this thing that was to be done the marquis wasdetermined to punish him personally and he could not resist thetemptation of fighting the marquis</s>  and then if he succumbed easilyin this matter would it not follow almost as a matter of course thatthe battle against him would be carried on elsewhere</s>  if he yieldednow resolving to ignore altogether any idea of his own comfort orhis own taste would he thereby maintain that tranquillity in hisparish which he thought so desirable</s>  he had already seen that in mr</s> puddlehams manner to himself which made him sure that mr</s>  puddlehamwas ambitious to be a sword in the right hand of the marquis</s> personally the vicar was himself pugnacious</s>  few men perhaps weremore so</s>  if there must be a fight let them come on and he would dohis best</s>  turning the matter thus backwards and forwards in his mindhe came at last to the conclusion that there must be a fight andconsequently he wrote the following letter to the marquis bullhampton vicarage january 3 186</s>  my lord marquis i learned by chance the other day in the village that a new chapel for the use of the methodist congregation of the parish was to be built on the little open green immediately opposite the vicarage gate and that this special spot of ground had been selected and given by your lordship for this purpose</s>  i do not at all know what truth there may be in thisexcept that mr</s>  grimes the carpenter here has received orders from your agent about the work</s>  it may probably be the case that the site has been chosen by mr</s>  packer and not by your lordship</s>  as no real delay to the building can at this time of the year arise from a short postponement of the beginning i have asked mr</s>  grimes to desist till i shall have written to you on the subject</s>  i can assure your lordship in the first place that no clergyman of the established church in the kingdom can be less unwilling than i am that they who dissent from my teaching in the parish should have a commodious place of worship</s>  if land belonged to me in the place i would give it myself for such a purpose and were there no other available site than that chosen i would not for a moment remonstrate against it</s>  i had heard with satisfaction from mr</s>  puddleham himself that another spot was chosen near the cross roads in the village on which there is more space to which as i believe there is no objection and which would certainly be nearer than that now selected to the majority of the congregation</s>  but of course it would not be for me to trouble your lordship as to the ground on which a methodist chapel should be built unless i had reason to show why the site now chosen is objectionable</s>  i do not for a moment question your lordships right to give the site</s>  there is something less than a quarter of an acre in the patch in question and though hitherto i have always regarded it as belonging in some sort to the vicarageas being a part as it were of the entrancei feel convinced that you as landlord of the ground would not entertain the idea of bestowing it for any purpose without being sure of your right to do so</s>  i raise no question on this point believing that there is none to be raised but i respectfully submit to your lordship whether such an erection as that contemplated by you will not be a lasting injury to the vicarage of bullhampton and whether you would wish to inflict a lasting and gratuitous injury on the vicar of a parish the greatest portion of which belongs to yourself</s>  no doubt life will be very possible to me and my wife and to succeeding vicars and their wives with a redbrick chapel built as a kind of watchtower over the vicarage gate</s>  so would life be possible at turnover park with a similar edifice immediately before your lordships halldoor</s>  knowing very well that the reasonable wants of the methodists cannot make such a building on such a spot necessary you no doubt would not consent to it and i now venture to ask you to put a stop to this building here for the same reason</s>  were there no other site in the parish equally commodious i would not say a word</s>  i have the honour to be your lordships most obedient servant francis fenwick</s> lord trowbridge when he received this letterwhen he had onlypartially read it and had not at all digested it was disposed toyield the point</s>  he was a silly man thinking much too highly of hisown position believing himself entitled to unlimited deference fromall those who in any way came within the rays of his magnificenceand easily made angry by opposition but he was not naturally proneto inflict evil and did in some degree recognise it as a dutyattached to his splendour that he should be beneficent to theinferiors with whom he was connected</s>  great as was his wrath againstthe present vicar of bullhampton and thoroughly as he conceived itto be expedient that so evilminded a pastor should be driven out ofthe parish nevertheless he felt some scruple at taking a step whichwould be injurious to the parish vicar let the parish vicar be whohe might</s>  packer was the sinner who had originated the new plan forpunishing mr</s>  fenwickpacker with the assistance of mr</s>  puddlehamand the marquis though he had in some sort authorised the plan hadin truth thought very little about it</s>  when the vicar spoke of thelasting injury to the vicarage and when lord trowbridge rememberedthat he owned two thousand and two acres within the parishas mr</s> puddleham had told himhe began to think that the chapel had betterbe built elsewhere</s>  the vicar was a pestilent man to whom punishmentwas due but the punishment should be made to attach itself to theman rather than to the mans office</s>  so was working the marquissmind till the marquis came upon that horrid passage in the vicarsletter in which it was suggested that the building of a methodistchapel in his own park immediately in front of his own augusthalldoor might under certain circumstances be expedient</s>  the remarkwas almost as pernicious and unpardonable as that which had beenmade about his lordships daughters</s>  it was manifest to him that thevicar intended to declare that marquises were no more than otherpeopleand that the declaration was made and insisted on with thedetermination of insulting him</s>  had this apostate priest been capableof feeling any proper appreciation of his own position and thatof the marquis he would have said nothing of turnover park</s>  whenthe marquis had read the letter a second time and had digested ithe perceived that its whole tenour was bad that the writer wasevilminded and that no request made by him should be granted</s>  eventhough the obnoxious chapel should have to be pulled down for thebenefit of another vicar it should be put up for the punishment ofthis vicar</s>  a man who wants to have a favour done for him can hardlyhope to be successful if he asks for the favour with insolence</s>  sothe heart of the marquis was hardened and he was strengthened to dothat which misbecame him both as a gentleman and a landlord</s> he did not answer the letter for some time but he saw packer sawhis head agent and got out the map of the property</s>  the map ofthe property was not very clear in the matter but he rememberedthe space well and convinced himself that no other place in allbullhampton could be so appropriate for a methodist chapel</s>  at theend of a week he caused a reply to be written to mr</s>  fenwick</s>  hewould not demean himself by writing with his own hand but he gavehis orders to the head agent</s>  the head agent merely informed thevicar that it was considered that the spot of ground in question wasthe most appropriate in the village for the purpose in hand</s> mrs</s>  fenwick when she heard

it</s> chapter xxxvi</s> sam brattle goes off again</s> mr</s>  grimes had suggested to the vicar in a very low whisper that thenew chapel might perhaps be put down as a nuisance</s>  it aint for meto say of course said mr</s>  grimes and in the way of business onebuilding is as good as another as long as you see your money</s>  butbuildings is stopped because theyre nuisances</s>  this occurred a dayor two after the receipt of the agents letter from turnover and thecommunication was occasioned by orders given to mr</s>  grimes to go onwith the building instantly unless he intended to withdraw from thejob</s>  i dont think grimes that i can call a place of christianworship a nuisance said the vicar</s>  to this grimes rejoined that hehad known a nunnery bell to be stopped because it was a nuisance andthat he didnt see why a methodist chapel bell was not as bad as anunnery bell</s>  fenwick had declared that he would fight if he couldfind a leg to stand upon and he thanked grimes saying that he wouldthink of the suggestion</s>  but when he thought of it he did not seethat any remedy was open to him on that side</s>  in the meantime mr</s> puddleham attacked grimes with great severity because the work wasnot continued</s>  mr</s>  puddleham feeling that he had the marquis athis back was eager for the fight</s>  he had already received in thestreet a salutation from the vicar cordial as usual with thevery slightest bend of his neck and the sourest expression of hismouth</s>  mrs</s>  puddleham had already taught the little puddlehams thatthe vicarage cabbages were bitter with the wormwood of an endowedestablishment and ought no longer to be eaten by the free childrenof an open church</s>  mr</s>  puddleham had already raised up his voice inhis existing tabernacle as to the injury which was being done tohis flock and had been very touching on the subject of the littlevineyard which the wicked king coveted</s>  when he described himself asnaboth it could not but be supposed that ahab and jezebel were bothin bullhampton</s>  it went forth through the village that mr</s>  puddlehamhad described mrs</s>  fenwick as jezebel and the torch of discord hadbeen thrown down and war was raging through the parish</s> there had come to be very high words indeed between mr</s>  grimes andmr</s>  puddleham and some went so far as to declare that they had heardthe builder threaten to punch the ministers head</s>  this mr</s>  grimesdenied stoutly as the methodist party were making much of it inconsequence of mr</s>  puddlehams cloth and advanced years</s>  theres nolies is too hot for them said mr</s>  grimes in his energy and nolawlessness too heavy</s>  then he absolutely refused to put his hand toa spade or a trowel</s>  he had his time named in his contract he saidand nobody had a right to drive him</s>  this was ended by the appearanceon a certain monday morning of a baptist builder from salisbury withall the appurtenances of his trade and with a declaration on mr</s> grimes part that he would have the law on the two leading membersof the puddleham congregation from whom he had received his originalorder</s>  in truth however there had been no contract and mr</s> grimes had gone to work upon a verbal order which according to thepuddleham theory he had already vitiated by refusing compliance withits terms</s>  he however was hot upon his lawsuit and thus the wholeparish was by the ears</s> it may be easily understood how much mr</s>  fenwick would suffer fromall this</s>  it had been specially his pride that his parish had been atpeace and he had plumed himself on the way in which he had continuedto clip the claws with which nature had provided the methodistminister</s>  though he was fond of a fight himself he had taughthimself to know that in no way could he do the business of hislife more highly or more usefully than as a peacemaker and as apeacemaker he had done it</s>  he had never put his hand within mr</s> puddlehams arm and whispered a little parochial nothing into hisneighbours ear without taking some credit to himself for hiscleverness</s>  he had called his peaches angels of peace and had spokenof his cabbages as being dovewinged</s>  all this was now over andthere was hardly one in bullhampton who was not busy hating andabusing somebody else</s> and then there came another trouble on the vicar</s>  just at the end ofjanuary sam brattle came up to the vicarage and told mr</s>  fenwickthat he was going to leave the mill</s>  sam was dressed very decentlybut he was attired in an unbullhampton fashion which was notpleasant to mr</s>  fenwicks eyes and there was about him an air whichseemed to tell of filial disobedience and personal independence</s> but you mean to come back again sam</s>  said the vicar</s> well sir i dont know as i do</s>  father and i has had words</s> and that is to be a reason why you should leave him</s>  you speak ofyour father as though he were no more to you than another man</s> i wouldnt a borne not a tenth of it from no other man mr</s> fenwick</s> welland what of that</s>  is there any measure of what is due by youto your father</s>  remember sam i know your father well</s> you do sir</s> he is a very just man and he is very fond of you</s>  you are the appleof his eye and now you would bring his gray hairs with sorrow to thegrave</s> you ask mother sir and shell tell you how it is</s>  i just said aword to hima word as was right to be said and he turned upon meand bade me go away and come back no more</s> do you mean that he has banished you from the mill</s> he said what i tells you</s>  he told mother afterwards that if so as iwould promise never to mention that thing again i might come and goas i pleased</s>  but i wasnt going to make no such promise</s>  i up andtold him so and then hecursed me</s> for a moment or two the vicar was silent thinking whether in thisaffair sam had been most wrong or the old man</s>  of course he washearing but one side of the question</s>  what was it sam that heforbade you to mention</s> it dont matter now sir only i thought id better come and tellyou along of your being the bail sir</s> do you mean that you are going to leave bullhampton altogether</s> to leave it altogether mr</s>
 fenwick</s>  i aint doing no good here</s> and why shouldnt you do good</s>  where can you do more good</s> it cant be good to be having words with father day after day</s> but sam i dont think you can go away</s>  you are bound by themagistrates orders</s>  i dont speak for myself but i fear the policewould be after you</s> and is it to go on allaysthat a chap cant move to betterhisself because them fellows cant catch the men as murdered oldtrumbull</s>  that cant be lawnor yet justice</s>  upon this there arosea discussion in which the vicar endeavoured to explain to the youngman that as he had evidently consorted with the men who were on thestrongest possible grounds suspected to be the murderers and ashe had certainly been with those men where he had no business tobenamely in mr</s>  fenwicks own garden at nighthe had no justcause of complaint at finding his own liberty more crippled than thatof other people</s>  no doubt sam understood this well enough as he wassharp and intelligent but he fought his own battle declaring thatas the vicar had not prosecuted him for being in the garden nobodycould be entitled to punish him for that offence and that as it hadbeen admitted that there was no evidence connecting him with themurder no policeman could have a right to confine him to one parish</s> he argued the matter so well that mr</s>  fenwick was left without muchto say</s>  he was unwilling to press his own responsibility in thematter of the bail and therefore allowed the question to fallthroughtacitly admitting that if sam chose to leave the parishthere was nothing in the affair of the murder to hinder him</s>  he wentback therefore to the inexpediency of the young mans departuretelling him that he would rush right into the devils jaws</s>  may beso mr</s>  fenwick said sam but im sure ill never be out of em aslong as i stays here in bullhampton</s> but what is it all about sam</s>  the vicar as he asked the questionhad a very distinct idea in his own head as to the cause of thequarrel and was aware that his sympathies were with the son ratherthan with the father</s>  sam answered never a word and the vicarrepeated his question</s>  you have quarrelled with your father beforethis and have made it up</s>  why should not you make up this quarrel</s> because he cursed me said sam</s> an idle word spoken in wrath</s>  dont you know your father wellenough to take that for what it is worth</s>  what was it about</s> it was about carry then</s> what had you said</s> i said as how she ought to be let come home again and that if i wasto stay there at the mill id fetch her</s>  then he struck at me withone of the millbolts</s>  but i didnt think much o that</s> was it then hecursed you</s> no mother came up and i went aside with her</s>  i told her as id goon speaking to the old man about carryand so i did</s> and where is carry</s>  sam made no reply to this whatever</s>  you knowwhere she can be found sam</s>  sam shook his head but didnt speak</s> you couldnt have said that you would fetch her if you didnt knowwhere to find her</s> i wouldnt stop till i did find her if the old man would take herback again</s>  shes bad enough no doubt but theres others worse norher</s> when did you see her last</s> over at pycroft</s> and whither did she go from pycroft sam</s> she went to lonon i suppose mr</s>  fenwick</s> and what is her address in london</s>  in reply to this sam again shookhis head</s>  do you mean to seek her now</s> whats the use of seeking her if i aint got nowhere to put herinto</s>  fathers got a house and plenty of room in it</s>  where could iput her</s> sam if youll find her and bring her to any place for me to seeher ill find a home for her somewhere</s>  i will indeed</s>  or if iknew where she was id go up to london to her myself</s>  shes not mysister</s> no sir she aint</s>  the likes of you wont likely have a sister thelikes of her</s>  shes asam stop</s>  dont say a bitter word of her</s>  you love her</s> yesi do</s>  that dont make her not a bad un</s> so do i love her</s>  and as for being bad which of us isnt bad</s>  theworld is very hard on her offence</s> down on it like a dog on a rat</s> it is not for me to make light of her sinbut her sin can bewashed away as well as other sin</s>  i love her too</s>  she was thebrightest kindest sauciest little lass in all the parish when icame here</s> father was proud enough of her then mr</s>  fenwick</s> you find her and let me know where she is and i will make out ahome for her somewherethat is if she will be tractable</s>  imafraid your father wont take her at the mill</s> hell never set eyes on her again if he can help it</s>  as for youmr</s>  fenwick if there was only a few more like you about the worldwouldnt be so bad to get on in</s>  goodbye mr</s>  fenwick</s> goodbye samif it must be so</s> and dont you be afeared about me mr</s>  fenwick</s>  if the hueandcryis out anyways again me ill turn up</s>  that i willthough it was tobe hung afterwardssooner than youd be hurt by anything id been adoing</s> so they parted as friends rather than as enemies though the vicarknew very well that the young man was wrong to go and leave hisfather and mother and that in all probability he would fall atonce into some bad mode of living</s>  but the conversation about carrybrattle had so softened their hearts to each other that mr</s>  fenwickfound it impossible to be severe</s>  and he knew moreover that noseverity of expression would have been of avail</s>  he couldnt havestopped sam from going had he preached to him for an hour</s> after that the building of the chapel went on apace the largetradesman from salisbury being quicker in his work than could havebeen the small tradesman belonging to bullhampton</s>  in february therecame a hard frost and still the bricklayers were at work</s>  it wassaid in bullhampton that walls built as those walls were being builtcould never stand</s>  but then it might be that these reports werespread by mr</s>  grimes that the fanatical ardour of the salisburybaptist lent something to the rapidity of his operations and thatthe bullhampton feeling in favour of mr</s>  fenwick and the churchestablishment added something to the bitterness of the prevailingcriticisms</s>  at any rate the walls of the new chapel were mountinghigher and higher all through february and by the end of the firstweek in march there stood immediately opposite to the vicarage gate ahideously ugly building roofless doorless windowlesswith thosehorrid wordsnew salem 186 legibly inscribed on a visiblestone inserted above the doorway a thing altogether as objectionableto the eyes of a church of england parish clergyman as theimagination

fenwick having discovered that the paint had been injuredon the vicarage gate had sent an angry message to the salisburybaptist</s>  the salisbury baptist had apologised to mr</s>  fenwick sayingthat such things would happen in the building of houses c</s>  and mr</s> fenwick had assured him that the matter was of no consequence</s>  he wasnot going to descend into the arena with the salisbury baptist</s>  inthis affair the marquis of trowbridge was his enemy and with themarquis he would fight if there was to be any fight at all</s>  he wouldstand at his gate and watch the work and speak

always went by the garden wicket butin going to the school she had to make a long round to avoid thechapeland this round she made day after day</s>  fenwick himselfstill hoping that there might be some power of fighting had writtento an enthusiastic archdeacon a friend of his who lived not veryfar distant</s>  the archdeacon had consulted the bishopreallytroubled deeply about the matterand the bishop had taken uponhimself with his own hands to write words of mild remonstrance tothe marquis</s>  for the welfare of the parish generally said thebishop i venture to make this suggestion to your

as to the sinsof the vicar</s>  nor did the marquis in his reply allude to the formercorrespondence</s>  he expressed an opinion that the erection of aplace of christian worship on an open space outside the bounds of aclergymans domain ought not to be held to be objectionable by thatclergymanand that as he had already given the spot he could notretract the gift</s>  these letters however had been written before thefirst brick had been laid and the world in that part of the countrywas of opinion that the marquis might have retracted his gift</s>  afterthis mr</s>  fenwick found no ground whatever on which he could fight hisbattle</s>  he could only stand at his gateway and look at the thing asit rose above the ground fascinated by its ugliness</s> he was standing there once about a

parson and i suppose hethinks he may have his fling as long as that lasts</s>  no doubt parsonjohn in saying this was desirous of proving to mary that waltermarrable was not dying of love and was upon the whole leading ajolly life in spite of the little misfortune that had happened tohim</s>  but mary understood all this quite as well as did parson johnhimself and simply declined to believe the hunting three days aweek</s>  she said not a word about it however either to him or to heraunt</s>  if walter could amuse himself so much the better but she wasquite sure that at such a period of his life as this he would notspend his money recklessly</s>  the truth lay between parson johnsstories and poor marys belief</s>  walter marrable was huntingperhapstwice a week hiring a horse occasionally

papers oreven the outadoor occupations of a soldier home upon leave who hasno work to do</s>  walter marrable told himself again and again that hewas very unhappy about his cousin but he certainly did not suffer inthat matter as mary suffered</s>  he had that other sorrow arising fromhis fathers cruel usage of him to divide his thoughts and probablythought quite as much of the manner in which he had been robbed ashe did of the loss of his love</s> but poor mary was in truth very wretched</s>  when a girl asks herselfthat questionwhat shall she do with her life</s>  it is so naturalthat she

the husband appointed for his wife so had waltermarrable been appointed for her</s>  and so there had come upon her adreamy conviction that marriages are made in heaven</s>  that questionwhether they were to be poor or rich to have enough or much lessthan enough for the comforts of life was no doubt one of muchimportance but in the few happy days of her assured engagement itwas not allowed by her

came</s> and as it had some effect on mary lowthers future conduct it shallbe given to the reader bullhampton vicarage march 12 186</s>  dearest mary i do so wish you were here if it were only to share our misery with us</s>  i did not think that so small a thing as the building of a wretched chapel could have put me out so much and made me so uncomfortable as this has done</s>  frank says that it is simply the feeling of being beatenthe insult not the injury which is the grievance but they both rankle with me</s>  i hear the click of the trowel every hour and though i never go near the front gate yet i know that it is all muddy and foul with brickbats and mortar</s>  i dont think that anything so cruel and unjust was ever done before and the worst of it is that frank though he hates it just as much as i do does preach such sermons to me about the wickedness of caring for small evils</s>  suppose you had to go to it every sunday yourself he said the other day trying to make me understand what a real depth of misery there is in the world</s>  i shouldnt mind that half so much i answered</s>  then he bade me try itwhich wasnt fair because he knows i cant</s>  however they say it will all tumble down because it has been built so badly</s>  i have been waiting to hear from you but i can understand why you should not write</s>  you do not wish to speak of your cousin or to write without speaking of him</s>  your aunt has written to me twice as doubtless you know and has told me that you are well only more silent than heretofore</s>  dearest mary do write to me and tell me what is in your heart</s>  i will not ask you to come to usnot yetbecause of our neighbour but i do think that if you were here i could do you good</s>  i know so well or fancy that i know so well the current in which your thoughts are running</s>  you have had a wound and think that therefore you must be a cripple for life</s>  but it is not so and such thoughts if not wicked are at least wrong</s>  i would that it had been otherwise</s>  i would that you had not met your cousin</s> so would not i said mary to herself but as she said it she knewthat she was wrong</s>  of course it would be for her welfare and forhis too if his heart was as hers that she should never have seenhim</s>  but because you have met him and have fancied that you and he would be all in all together you will be wrong indeed if you let that fancy ruin your future life</s>  or if you encourage yourself to feel that because you have loved one man from whom you are necessarily parted therefore you should never allow yourself to become attached to another you will indeed be teaching yourself an evil lesson</s>  i think i can understand the arguments with which you may perhaps endeavour to persuade your heart that its work of loving has been done and should not be renewed but i am quite sure that they are false and inhuman</s>  the indian indeed allows herself to be burned through a false idea of personal devotion and if that idea be false in a widow how much falser is it in one who has never been a wife</s>  you know what have ever been our wishes</s>  they are the same now as heretofore and his constancy is of that nature that nothing will ever change it</s>  i am persuaded that it would have been unchanged even if you had married your cousin though in that case he would have been studious to keep out of your way</s>  i do not mean to press his claims at present</s>  i have told him that he should be patient and that if the thing be to him as important as he makes it he should be content to wait</s>  he replied that he would wait</s>  i ask for no word from you at present on this subject</s>  it will be much better that there should be no word</s>  but it is right that you should know that there is one who loves you with a devotion which nothing can alter</s>  i will only add to this my urgent prayer that you will not make too much to yourself of your own misfortune or

letter from mrs</s>  fenwick which the reader has just seen was theimmediate effect of a special visit which mr</s>  gilmore had made toher</s>  on the 10th of march he had come to her with a settled purposepointing out to her that he had now waited a certain number of monthssince he had heard of the rupture between mary and her cousin namingthe exact period which mrs</s>  fenwick had bade him wait before heshould move again in the matter and asking her whether he might notnow venture to take some step</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick had felt it to be unfairthat her very words should be quoted against her as to the three orfour months feeling that she had said three or four instead of sixor seven to soften the matter to her friend but nevertheless shehad been induced to write to mary lowther</s> i was thinking that perhaps you might ask her to come to youagain mr</s>  gilmore had said when mrs</s>  fenwick rebuked him for hisimpatience</s>  if you did that the thing might come on naturally</s> but she wouldnt come if i did ask her</s> because she hates me so much that she will not venture to come nearme</s> what nonsense that is harry</s>  it has nothing to do with hating</s>  if ithought that she even disliked you i should tell you so believingthat it would be for the best</s>  but of course if i asked her herejust at present she could not but remember that you are our nearestneighbour and feel that she was pressed to come with some referenceto your hopes</s> and therefore she would not come</s> exactly and if you will think of it how could it be otherwise</s> wait till he is in india</s>  wait at any rate till the summer and thenfrank and i will do our best to get her here</s> i will wait said mr</s>  gilmore and immediately took his leave asthough there were no other subject of conversation now possible tohim</s> since his return from loring mr</s>  gilmores life at his own house hadbeen quite secluded</s>  even the fenwicks had hardly seen him thoughthey lived so near to him</s>  he had rarely been at church had seen nocompany at home since his uncle the prebendary had left him andhad not dined even at the vicarage more than once or twice</s>  all thishad of course been frequently discussed between mr</s>  and mrs</s>  fenwickand had made the vicar very unhappy</s>  he had expressed a fear thathis friend would be driven half crazy by a foolish indulgence in ahopeless passion and had suggested that it might perhaps be for thebest that gilmore should let his place and travel abroad for twoor three years so that in that way his disappointment might beforgotten</s>  but mrs</s>  fenwick still hoped better things than this</s>  sheprobably thought more of mary lowther than she did of harry gilmoreand still believed that a cure for both their sorrows might be foundif one would only be patient and the other would not despair</s> mr</s>  gilmore had promised that he would wait and then mrs</s>  fenwickhad written her letter</s>  to this there came a very quick answer</s>  inrespect to the trouble about the chapel mary lowther was sympatheticand droll as she would have been had there been upon her the weightof no love misfortune</s>  she had trust she said in mr</s>  quickenhamwho no doubt would succeed in harassing the enemy even though hemight be unable to obtain ultimate conquest</s>  and then there seemedto be a fair prospect that the building would fall of itself whichsurely would be a great triumph</s>  and after all might it not fairlybe hoped that the pleasantness of the vicarage garden which mr</s> puddleham must see every time he visited his chapel might be quiteas galling and as vexatious to him as would be the ugliness of themethodist building to the fenwicks</s> you should take comfort in the reflection that his sides will bequite as full of thorns as your own said mary and perhaps theremay come some blessed opportunity for crushing him altogether byheaping hot coals of fire on his head</s>  offer him the use of thevicarage lawn for one of his school teaparties and that i shouldthink would about finish him</s> this was all very well and was written on purpose to show to mrs</s> fenwick that mary could still be funny in spite of her troubles butthe pith of the letter as mrs</s>  fenwick well understood lay in thefew words of the last paragraph</s> dont suppose dear that i am going to die of a broken heart</s>  imean to live and to be as happy as any of you</s>  but you must let me goon in my own way</s>  i am not at all sure that being married is not moretrouble than it is worth</s> that she was deceiving herself in saying this mary knew well enoughand mrs</s>  fenwick too guessed that it was so</s>  nevertheless it wasplain enough that nothing more could be said about mr</s>  gilmore justat present</s> you ought to blow him up and make him come to us mrs</s>  fenwicksaid to her husband</s> it is all very well to say that but one man cant blow anotherup as women do</s>  men dont talk to

come when the vicar would not be there</s>  he sauntered intothe garden by the little gate from the churchyard and showed himselfat the drawingroom window without going round to the front door</s>

dining at sir thomass theother day i had myself put down at the church gate and walked allthe way round though it was nearly pitch dark</s>  do come in harry</s> illustration do come in harry</s> then mr</s>  gilmore came in and seated himself before the fire</s>  mrs</s> fenwick understood his moods so well that she would not say a wordto hurry him</s>  if he chose to talk about mary lowther she knew verywell what she would say to him but she would not herself introducethe subject</s>  she spoke for awhile about the brattles saying that theold man had suffered much since his son had gone from him</s>  sam hadleft bullhampton at the end of january never having returned to themill after his visit to the vicar and had not been heard of since</s> gilmore however had not been to see his tenant

fenwick</s>  he asked at last</s> i wrote to mary soon after you were last here</s> and has she answered you</s> yes she wrote again almost at once</s>  she could not but write as ihad said so much to

cannot be done in a day</s>  if i were to ask her now she wouldnot come and if she came it would not be for your good</s>  wait tillthe summer</s>  you may be sure that no harm will be done by a littlepatience</s> then he went away declaring again that he would wait with patiencebut saying at the same time that he would remain at home</s>  as forgoing to london he said i should do nothing there</s>  when i findthat there is no chance left then probably i shall go abroad</s> it is my belief said the vicar that evening when his wife toldhim what had occurred that she will never have him not because shedoes not like him or could not learn to like him if he were as othermen are but simply because he is so unreasonably unhappy about her</s> no woman was ever got by that sort of puling and whining love</s>  if itwere not that i think him crazy i should say that it was unmanly</s> but he is crazy</s> and will be still worse before he has done with it</s>  anything wouldbe good now

this mr</s>  fenwick was standing at his own gatewatching the building of the chapel and talking to the men whenfanny brattle from the mill came up to him</s>  he would stand there bythe hour at a time and had made quite a friendship with the foremanof the builder from salisbury although the foreman like his masterwas a dissenter and had come into the parish as an enemy</s>  allbullhampton knew how infinite was the disgust of the vicar at whatwas being done and that mrs</s>  fenwick felt it so strongly that shewould not even go in and out of her own gate</s>  all bullhampton wasaware that mr</s>  puddleham spoke openly of the vicar as his enemyinspite of the peaches and cabbages on which the young puddlehamshad been nourished and that the methodist minister had more thanonce within the last month or two denounced his brother of theestablished church from his own pulpit</s>  all bullhampton was talkingof the building of the chapelsome abusing the marquis and mr</s> puddleham and the salisbury builder others on the other handdeclaring that it was very good that the establishment should have afall</s>  nevertheless there mr</s>  fenwick would stand and chat with themen fascinated after a fashion by the misfortune which had come uponhim</s>  mr</s>  packer the marquiss steward had seen him there and hadendeavoured to slink away unobservedfor mr</s>  packer was somewhatashamed of the share he had had in the matterbut mr</s>  fenwick hadcalled to him and had spoken to him of the progress of the building</s> grimes never could have done it so fast said the vicar</s> wellnot so fast mr</s>  fenwick certainly</s> i suppose it wont signify about the frost</s>  said the vicar</s>  ishould be inclined to think that the mortar will want repointing</s> mr</s>  packer had nothing to say to this</s>  he was not responsible for thebuilding</s>  he endeavoured to explain that the marquis had nothing todo with the work and had simply given the land</s> which was all that he could do said the vicar laughing</s> it was on the same day and while packer was still standing close tohim that fanny brattle accosted him</s>  when he had greeted the youngwoman and perceived that she wished to speak to him he withdrewwithin his own gate and asked her whether there was anything that hecould do for her</s>  she had a letter in her hand and after a littlehesitation she asked him to read it</s>  it was from her brother and hadreached her by private means</s>  a young man had brought it to her whenher father was in the mill and had then gone off declining to waitfor any answer</s> father sir knows nothing about it as yet she said</s> mr</s>  fenwick took the letter and read it</s>  it was as follows dear sister i want you to help me a little for things is very bad with me</s>  and it is not for me neither or id sooner starve nor ax for a sixpence from the mill</s>  but carry is bad too and if youve got a trifle or so i think youd be of a mind to send it</s>  but dont tell father on no account</s>  i looks to you not to tell father</s>  tell mother if you will but i looks to her not to mention it to father</s>  if it be so you have two pounds by you send

letter and thinks i had better cometo you to ask what we should do</s> have you got the money fanny</s> fanny brattle explained that she had in her pocket something over thesum named but that money was so scarce with them now at the millthat she could hardly send it without her fathers knowledge</s>  shewould not she said be afraid to send it and then to tell her fatherafterwards</s>  the vicar considered the matter for some time standingwith the open letter in his hand and then he gave his advice</s> come into the house fanny he said and write a line to yourbrother and then get a money order at the postoffice for fourpounds and send it to your brother and tell him that i lend itto him till times shall be better with him</s>  do not give him yourfathers money without your fathers leave</s>  sam will pay me some dayunless i be mistaken in him</s> then fanny brattle with many grateful thanks did as the vicar badeher</s> chapter xxxix</s> the three honest men</s> the vicar of bullhampton wasa good sort of fellow</s>  in praise ofhim to this extent it is hoped that the reader will cordially agree</s> but it cannot be denied that he was the most imprudent of men</s>  hehad done very much that was imprudent in respect to the marquis oftrowbridge and since he had been at bullhampton had been imprudentin nearly everything that he had done regarding the brattles</s>  he waswell aware that the bold words which he had spoken to the marquis hadbeen dragons teeth sown by himself and that they had sprung up fromthe ground in the shape of the odious brick building which now stoodimmediately in face of his own vicarage gate</s>  though he would smileand be droll and talk to the workmen he hated that building quiteas bitterly as did his wife</s>  and now in regard to the brattlesthere came upon him a great trouble</s>  about a week after he had lentthe four pounds to fanny on sams behalf there came to him a dirtynote from salisbury written by sam himself in which he was toldthat carry brattle was now at the three honest men a publichouse inone of the suburbs of the city waiting there till mr</s>  fenwick shouldfind a home for herin accordance with his promise given to herbrother</s>  sam in his letter had gone on to explain that it would bewell that mr</s>  fenwick should visit the three honest men speedily asotherwise there would be a bill there which neither carry nor samwould be able to defray</s>  poor sams letter was bald and they who didnot understand his position might have called it bold</s>  he wrote tothe vicar as though the vicars coming to salisbury for the requiredpurpose was a matter of course and demanded a home for his sisterwithout any reference to her future mode of life or power of earningher bread as though it was the vicars manifest duty to provide suchhome</s>  and then that caution in regard to the bill was rather a threatthan anything else</s>  if you dont take her quickly from the threehonest men therell be the very mischief of a bill for you to pay</s> that was the meaning of the caution and so the vicar understood it</s> but mr</s>  fenwick though he was imprudent was neither unreasonablenor unintelligent</s>  he had told sam brattle that he would providea home for carry if sam would find his sister and induce her toaccept the offer</s>  sam had gone to work and had done his part</s>  havingdone it he was right to claim from the vicar his share of theperformance</s>  and then was it not a matter of course that carry whenfound should be without means to pay her own expenses</s>  was it to besupposed that a girl in her position would have money by her</s>  and hadnot mr</s>  fenwick known the truth about their poverty when he had giventhose four pounds to fanny brattle to be sent up to sam in london</s> mr</s>  fenwick was both reasonable and intelligent as to all this andthough he felt that he was in trouble did not for a moment thinkof denying his responsibility or evading the performance of hispromise</s>  he must find a home for poor carry and pay any bill at thethree honest men which he might find standing there in her name</s> of course he told his trouble to his wife and of course he wasscolded for the promise he had given</s>  but my dear frank if forher why not for others and how is it possible</s> for her and not for others because she is an old friend aneighbours child and one of the parish</s>  that question was easilyanswered</s> but how is it possible frank</s>  of course one would do anything thatit is possible to save her</s>  what i mean is that one would do it forall of them if only it were possible</s> if you can do it for one will not even that be much</s> but what is to be done</s>  who will take her</s>  will she go into areformatory</s> i fear not</s> there are so many and i do not know how they are to be treatedexcept in a body</s>  where can you find a home for her</s> she has a married sister janet</s> who would not speak to her or let her inside the door of her house</s> surely frank you know the unforgiving nature of women of that classfor such sin as poor carry brattles</s> i wonder whether they ever say their prayers said the vicar</s> of course they do</s>  mrs</s>  jay no doubt is a religious woman</s>  but itis permitted to them not to forgive that sin</s> by what law</s> by the law of custom</s>  it is all very well frank but you cantfight against it</s>  at any rate you cant ignore it till it has beenfought against and conquered</s>  and it is useful</s>  it keeps women fromgoing astray</s> you think then that nothing should be done for this poor creaturewho fell so piteously with so small a sin</s> i have not said so</s>  but when you promised her a home where didyou think of finding one for her</s>  her only fitting home is with hermother and you know that her father will not take her there</s> mr</s>  fenwick said nothing more at that moment not having clearly madeup his mind as to what he might best do but he had before his eyesdimly a plan by which he thought it possible that he might forcecarry brattle on her fathers heart</s>  if this plan might be carriedout he would take her to the millhouse and seat her in the roomin which the family lived and then bring the old man in from hiswork</s>  it might be that jacob brattle in his wrath would turn withviolence upon the man who had dared thus to interfere in the affairsof his family but he would certainly offer no rough usage to thepoor girl</s>  fenwick knew the man well enough to be sure that he wouldnot lay his hands in anger upon a woman</s> but something must be done at oncesomething before any such planas that which was running through his brain could be matured andcarried into execution</s>  there was carry at the three honest men andfor aught the vicar knew her brother staying with herwith histhe vicars credit pledged for their maintenance</s>  it was quite clearthat something must be done</s>  he had applied to his wife and hiswife did not know how to help him</s>  he had suggested the wife of theironmonger at warminster as the proper guardian for the poor childand his own wife had at once made him understand that this wasimpractical</s>  indeed how was it possible that such a one as carrybrattle should be kept out of sight and stowed away in an openhardwareshop in a provincial town</s>  the properest place for her wouldbe in the country on some farm and so thinking he determined toapply to the girls eldest brother</s> george brattle was a prosperous man living on a large farm nearfordingbridge ten or twelve miles the other side of salisbury</s>  ofhim the vicar knew very little and of his wife nothing</s>  that the manhad been married fourteen or fifteen years and had a family growingup the vicar did know and knowing it feared that mrs</s>  brattle ofstartup as their farm was called would not be willing to receivethis proposed new inmate</s>  but he would try</s>  he would go on to startupafter having seen carry at the three honest men and use whateloquence he could command for the occasion</s> he drove himself over on the next day to meet an early train andwas in salisbury by nine oclock</s>  he had to ask his way to the threehonest men and at last had some difficulty in finding the house</s> it was a small beershop in a lane on the very outskirts of thecity and certainly seemed to him as he looked at it to be asdisreputable a house in regard to its outward appearance as ever hehad proposed to enter</s>  it was a brick building of two stories with adoor in the middle of it which stood open and a red curtain hangingacross the window on the lefthand side</s>  three men dressed likenavvies were leaning against the doorposts</s>  there is no signperhaps which gives to a house of this class so disreputable anappearance as red curtains hung across the window and yet there isno other colour for pothouse curtains that has any popularity</s>  theone fact probably explains the other</s>  a drinkingroom with a blue ora brown curtain would offer no attraction to the thirsty navvy wholikes to have his thirst indulged without criticism</s>  but in spite ofthe red curtain fenwick entered the house and asked the uncomelywoman at the bar after sam brattle</s>  was there a man named sam brattlestaying therea man with a sister</s> then were let loose against the unfortunate clergyman the floodgatesof a drunken womans angry tongue</s>  it was not only that the landladyof the three honest men was very drunk but also that she was veryangry</s>  sam brattle and his sister had been there but they had beenturned out of the house</s>  there had manifestly been some great rowand carry brattle was spoken of with all the worst terms of reproachwhich one woman can heap upon the name of another</s>  the mistress ofthe three honest men was a married womanand as far as that wentrespectable whereas poor carry was not married and certainly notrespectable</s>  something of her past history had been known</s>  she hadbeen called names which she could not repudiate and the truth ofwhich even her brother on her behalf could not deny and then she hadbeen turned into the street</s>  so much mr</s>  fenwick learned from thedrunken woman and nothing more he could learn</s>  when he asked aftercarrys present address the woman jeered at him and accused him ofbase purposes in coming after such a one</s>  she stood with arms akimboin the passage and said she would raise the neighbourhood on him</s> she was drunk and dirty as foul a thing as the eye could look uponevery other word was an oath and no phrase used by the lowest ofmen in their lowest moments was too hot or too bad for her womanstongue and yet there was the indignation of outraged virtue in herdemeanour and in her language because this stranger had come to herdoor asking after a girl who had been led astray</s>  our vicar carednothing for the neighbourhood and indeed cared very little forthe woman at allexcept in so far as she disgusted him but he didcare much at finding that he could obtain no clue to her whom he wasseeking</s>  the woman would not even tell him when the girl had lefther house or give him any assistance towards finding her</s>  he had atfirst endeavoured to mollify the virago by offering to pay the amountof any expenses which might have been left unsettled but even onthis score he could obtain no consideration</s>  she continued to revilehim and he was obliged to leave herwhich he did at last with ahurried step to avoid a quart pot which the woman had taken up tohurl at his head upon some comparison which he most indiscreetlymade between herself and poor carry brattle</s> what should he do now</s>  the only chance of finding the girl was as hethought to go to the policeoffice</s>  he was still in the lane makinghis way back to the street which would take him into the citywhen he was accosted by a

fact</s>  then you be to come with me</s>  whereupon mr</s>  fenwickfollowed the child and was led into a miserable little court inwhich population was squalid thick and juvenile</s>  she be here

took the path to the millalong the river</s>  he walked rapidly with his nose in the air asthough it was a manifest duty now that he found himself in thecountry to get over as much ground as possible

with his hands inhis pockets on the bridge which divided the house from the mill withhis pipe in his mouth was old brattle engaged for the moment insaying some word to his daughter fanny who was

the ground very well</s>  man and boy he hadknown it for sixty years</s>  as far as his mind went he thought it avery good thing that the piece of ground should be put to some usefulpurpose at

thinking sir</s>  there wasnt so muchfencing of sheep then as there be now</s>  boys was cheaper in themdays</s> just so and the parson wouldnt allow other sheep there</s> muster smallbones mostly took all he could get sir</s> exactly</s>  the parsons generally did i believe</s>  it was the way inwhich they followed most accurately the excellent examples set themby the bishops</s>  but mr</s>  brattle it wasnt in the way of tithes thathe had this grass for his sheep</s> i cant say how he had it nor yet how muster fenwick has themeadows tother side of the river which he lets to farmer

sir the lawyers might have a turnat it yet and the miller laughed at his own wit</s> and get more out of it than any former occupant said mr</s> quickenham who would indeed have been very loth to

bade farewell to the miller and thought that he sawa way to a case</s>  but he was a man very strongly given to accuracyand on his return to the vicarage said no word of his conversationwith the

at turnover castle</s> it was not only at bullhampton that this affair of the methodistchapel demanded and received attention</s>  at turnover also a good dealwas being said about it and the mind of

parish which he as landlordwas bound to treat with beneficent consideration</s>  the marquis hadreplied to the bishop with a tone of stern resolve</s>  the vicar ofbullhampton had treated him with scorn nay as he thought with mostunpardonable insolence and he would not spare the vicar</s>  it wasproper that the dissenters at bullhampton should have a chapel andhe had a right to do what he liked with his own</s>  so arguing withhimself he had written to the bishop very firmly but his own mindhad not been firm within him as he did so</s>  there were misgivingsat his heart</s>  he was a churchman himself and he was pricked withremorse as he remembered that he was spiting the church which wasconnected with the state of which he was so eminent a supporter</s>  hisown chief agent too had hesitated and had suggested that perhapsthe matter might be postponed</s>  his august daughters though theyhad learned to hold the name of fenwick in proper abhorrencenevertheless were grieved about the chapel</s>  men and women weretalking about it and the words of the common people found their wayto the august daughters of the house of stowte</s> papa said lady carolina wouldnt it perhaps be better to buildthe bullhampton chapel a little farther off from the vicarage</s> the next vicar might be a different sort of person said the ladysophie</s> no it wouldnt said the earl who was apt to be very imperiouswith his own daughters although he was of opinion that they shouldbe held in great awe by all the worldexcepting only himself andtheir eldest brother</s> that eldest brother lord saint george was in truth regarded atturnover as being of all persons in the world the most august</s> the marquis himself was afraid of his son and held him in extremeveneration</s>  to the mind of the marquis the heir expectant of all thedignities of the house of stowte was almost a greater man than theowner of them and this feeling came not only from a consciousnesson the part of the father that his son was a bigger man than himselfcleverer better versed in the affairs of the world and more thoughtof by those around them but also to a certain extent from an ideathat he who would have all these grand things thirty or perhaps evenfifty years hence must be more powerful than one with whom theirpossession would come to an end probably after the lapse of eightor ten years</s>  his heir was to him almost divine</s>  when things atthe castle were in any way uncomfortable he could put up with thediscomfort for himself and his daughters but it was not to beendured that saint george should be incommoded</s>  old carriagehorsesmust be changed if he were coming the glazing of the new greenhousemust be got out of the way lest he should smell the paint the gamemust not be touched till he should come to shoot it</s>  and yet lordsaint george himself was a man who never gave himself any airs andwho in his personal intercourse with the world around him demandedmuch less acknowledgment of his magnificence than did his father</s> and now during this easter week lord saint george came down tothe castle intending to kill two birds with one stone to take hisparliamentary holiday and to do a little business with his father</s> it not unfrequently came to pass that he found it necessary torepress the energy of his fathers august magnificence</s>  he would goso far as to remind his father that in these days marquises were notvery different from other people except in this that they perhapsmight have more money</s>  the marquis would fret in silence not daringto commit himself to an argument with his son and would in secretlament over the altered ideas of the age</s>  it was his theory ofpolitics that the old distances should be maintained and that thehead of a great family should be a patriarch entitled to obediencefrom those around him</s>  it was his sons idea that every man wasentitled to as much obedience as his money would buy and to no more</s> this was very lamentable to the marquis but nevertheless his sonwas the coming man and even this must be borne</s> im sorry about this chapel at bullhampton said the son to thefather after dinner</s> why sorry saint george</s>  i thought you would have been of opinionthat the dissenters should have a chapel</s> certainly they should if theyre fools enough to want to builda place to pray in when they have got one already built for them</s> theres no reason on earth why they shouldnt have a chapel seeingthat nothing that we can do will save them from schism</s> we cant prevent dissent saint george</s> we cant prevent it because in religion as in everything else menlike to manage themselves</s>  this farmer or that tradesman becomes adissenter because he can be somebody in the management of his

had better leave that to the bishop my lord</s> we must feel about it connected as we are with the parish saidthe marquis</s> but i dont think we shall do any good by going into a parochialquarrel</s> it was the very best bit of land for the purpose in allbullhampton said the marquis</s>  i made particular inquiry and therecan be no doubt of that</s>  though i particularly dislike that mr</s> fenwick it was not done to injure him</s> it does injure him damnably my lord</s> thats only an accident</s> and im not at all sure that we shant find that we have made amistake</s> how a mistake</s>

there has come up a shadow of a doubt and soonerthan be in the wrong we give another site and take all the expense</s> i think that would be the right sort of thing to do</s> lord saint george

some pit whenever he declined to follow his sonsadvice</s>  his son had a painful way of being right that was a greattrouble to him</s>  and this was a question which touched him verynearly</s>  it was not only that he must yield to mr</s>  fenwick before theeyes of mr</s>  puddleham and all the people of bullhampton but that hemust confess his own ignorance as to the borders of his own

been welldeserved</s>  colonel marrable had as a younger brother never beencontent with what he was able to extract from the head of the familywho was in his eyes a milch cow that never ought to run dry</s>  withwalter marrable there had remained a feeling adverse to his uncle andcousin even after he had been forced to admit to himself how manyand how grievous were the sins of his own father</s>  he had believedthat the dunripple people were stupid and prejudiced and selfishand it had only been at the instance of his uncle the parson thathe had consented to make the visit</s>  he had gone there and had beentreated at any rate with affectionate consideration</s>  and he hadfound the house to be not unpleasant though very quiet</s>  living atdunripple there was a mrs</s>  brownlow a

to mary lowther to inform her ofhis decision</s>  it does seem hard he said in his letter that anarrangement which is in so many respects desirable should not havebeen compatible with one which is so

himself and told that somewhat coldly</s>  of edith brownlowand of the proposition in regard to her of course he said nothing</s> it was the intention both of sir gregory and his son that the newinmate of the house should marry edith</s>  the old man who up to alate date had with weak persistency urged the match upon his sonhad taken up the idea from the very first arrival of his nephewat

within the last few monthsbecome engaged to and had broken his engagement with his cousinmary lowther</s>  but he found that he could not do it</s>  in the firstplace she would understand more than he meant her to understand ifhe made the attempt</s>  she would know that he was putting her on herguard and would take it as an insult</s>  and then he could not bringhimself to talk about mary lowther

had he refused to accede to marys propositionfor a separation and had he come to dunripple as an engaged man hemight he thought have reconciled his uncleor at least his cousingregoryto his marriage with mary</s>  but he did not see his way backto that position now having been entertained at his uncles house ashis uncles heir for so long a time without having mentioned it</s> at last he went off to windsor sad at heart having received frommary an answer to his letter which he felt to be very cold verydiscreet and very unsatisfactory</s>  she had merely expressed a ferventwish that whether he

with myself</s> parson john marrable though he said nothing in his letters todunripple about the doings of his nephew at loring was by nomeans equally reticent in his speech at loring as to the doings atdunripple</s>  how he came by his news he did not say but he had ever somuch to tell</s>  and miss marrable who knew him well was aware thathis news was not simple gossip but was told with an object</s>  inhis way parson john was a crafty man who was always doing a turnof business</s>  to his mind it was clearly inexpedient and almostimpracticable that his nephew and mary lowther should ever becomeman and wife</s>  he knew that they were separated but he knew alsothat they had agreed to separate on terms which would easily admitof being reconsidered</s>  he too had heard of edith brownlow and hadheard that if a marriage could be arranged between walter and ediththe family troubles would be in a fair way of settlement</s>  no goodcould come to anybody from that other marriage</s>  as for mary lowtherit was manifestly her duty to become mrs</s>  gilmore</s>  he therefore tooksome trouble to let the ladies at uphill know that captain marrablehad been received very graciously at dunripple that he was makinghimself very happy there hunting shooting and forgetting his oldtroubles that it was understood that he was to be recognised as theheirand that there was a young lady in the case the favourite ofsir gregory</s> he understood the world too well to say a word to mary lowtherherself about her rival</s>  mary would have perceived his drift</s>  buthe expressed his ideas about edith confidentially to miss marrablefully alive to the fact that miss marrable would know how to dealwith her niece</s>  it is by far the best thing that could have happenedto him said the parson</s>  as for going out to india again for a manwith his prospects it was very bad</s> but his cousin isnt much older than he is suggested missmarrable</s> yes he isa great deal older</s>  and gregorys health is so bad thathis life is not worth a years purchase</s>  poor fellow</s>  they tell me heonly cares to live till he has got his book out</s>  the truth is thatif walter could make a match of it with edith brownlow they mightarrange something about the property which would enable him to livethere just as though the place were his own</s>  the colonel would be theonly stumblingblock and after what he has done he could hardlyrefuse to agree to anything</s> theyd have to pay him said miss marrable</s> then he must be paid thats all</s>  my brother gregory is wrapped upin that girl and he would do anything for her welfare</s>  im told thatshe and walter have taken very kindly to each other already</s> it would be better for mary lowther that walter marrable should marryedith brownlow</s>  such at least was miss marrables belief</s>  she couldsee that mary though she bore herself bravely still did so as onewho had received a wound for which there was no remedyas a manwho has lost a leg and who nevertheless intends to enjoy life thoughhe knows that he never can walk again</s>  but in this case the realbar to walking was the hope in marys breasta hope that wasstill present though it was not nourishedthat the leg was notirremediably lost</s>  if captain marrable would finish all that bymarrying edith thenso thought miss marrablein process of timethe cure would be made good and there might be another leg</s>  she didnot believe much in the captains constancy and was quite ready tolisten to the story about another love</s>  and so from day to day wordswere dropped into marys ear which had their effect</s> i must say that i am glad that he is not to go to india said missmarrable to her niece</s> so indeed am i answered mary</s> in the first place it is such an excellent thing that he should beon good terms at dunripple</s>  he must inherit the property some dayand the title too</s> to this mary made no reply</s>  it seemed to her to have been hard thatthe real state of things should not have been explained to her beforeshe gave up her lover</s>  she had then regarded any hope of relieffrom dunripple as being beyond measure distant</s>  there had been apossibility and that was alla chance to which no prudent man orwoman would have looked in making their preparations for the lifebefore them</s>  that had been her idea as to the dunripple prospectsand now it seemed that on a sudden walter was to be regarded asalmost the immediate heir</s>  she did not blame him but it did appearto be hard upon her</s> i dont see the slightest reason why he shouldnt live atdunripple continued miss marrable</s> only that he would be dependent</s>  i suppose he does not mean to sellout of the army altogether</s> at any rate he may be backwards and forwards</s>  you see there is nochance of sir gregorys own son marrying</s> so they say</s> and his position would be really that of a younger brother insimilar circumstances</s> mary paused a moment before she replied and then she spoke out</s> dear aunt sarah what does all this mean</s>  i know you are speaking atme and yet i dont quite understand it</s>  everything between me andcaptain marrable is over</s>  i have no possible means of influencinghis life</s>  if i were told tomorrow that he had given up the army andtaken to living altogether at dunripple i should have no means ofjudging whether he had done well or ill</s>  indeed i should have noright to judge</s> you must be glad that the family should be united</s> i am glad</s>  now is that all</s> i want you to bring yourself to think without regret of his probablemarriage with this young lady</s> you dont suppose i shall blame him if he marries her</s> but i want you to see it in such a light that it shall not make youunhappy</s> i think dear aunt that we had better not talk of it</s>  i can assureyou of this that if i could prevent him from marrying by holding upmy little finger i would not do it</s> it would be ten thousand pities urged the old lady that eitherhis life or yours should be a sacrifice to a little episode whichafter all only took a week or two in the acting</s> i can only answer for myself said mary</s>  i dont mean to be asacrifice</s> there were many such conversations and by degrees they did have aneffect upon mary lowther</s>  she learned to believe that it was probablethat captain marrable should marry miss brownlow and of courseasked herself questions as to the effect such a marriage would haveupon herself which she answered more fully than she did those whichwere put to her by her aunt</s>  then there came to parson john somepapers which required his signature in reference to the disposalof a small sum of money he having been one of the trustees to hisbrothers marriage settlement</s>  this was needed in regard to someprovision which the baronet was making for his niece and which ifread aright would rather have afforded evidence against than infavour of the chance of her immediate marriage but it was takenat loring to signify that the thing was to be done and that thecourtship was at any rate in progress</s>  mary did not believe allthat she heard but there was left upon her mind an idea thatwalter marrable was preparing himself for the sudden change of hisaffections</s>  then she determined that should he do so she would notjudge him to have done wrong</s>  if he could settle himself comfortablyin this way why should he not do so</s>  she was told that edithbrownlow was pretty and gentle and good and would undoubtedlyreceive from sir gregorys hands all that sir gregory could giveher</s>  it was expedient for the sake of the whole family that sucha marriage should be arranged</s>  she would not stand in the way ofit and indeed how could she stand in the way of it</s>  had not herengagement with captain marrable been dissolved at her own instancein the most solemn manner possible</s>  let him marry whom he might shecould have no ground of complaint on that score</s> she was in this state of mind when she received captain marrablesletter from dunripple</s>  when she opened it for a moment she thoughtthat it would convey to her tidings respecting miss brownlow</s>  whenshe had read it she told herself how impossible it was that heshould have told her of his new matrimonial intentions even if heentertained them</s>  the letter gave no evidence either one way or theother but it confirmed to her the news which had reached her throughparson john that her former lover intended to abandon that specialcareer his choice of which had made it necessary that they twoshould abandon their engagement</s>  when at loring he had determinedthat he must go to india</s>  he had found it to be impossible that heshould live without going to india</s>  he had now been staying a fewweeks at dunripple with his uncle and with edith brownlow and itturned out that he need not go to india at all</s>  then she sat downand wrote to him that guarded civil but unenthusiastic letter ofwhich the reader has already heard</s>  she had allowed herself to bewounded and made sore by what they had told her of edith brownlow</s> it was still early in the spring just in the middle of april whenmary received another letter from her friend at bullhampton a letterwhich made her turn all these things in her mind very seriously</s>  ifwalter marrable were to marry edith brownlow what sort of futurelife should she mary lowther propose to herself</s>  she was firmlyresolved upon one thing that it behoved her to look rather to whatwas right than to what might simply be pleasant</s>  but would it beright that she should consider herself to be as it were widowed bythe frustration of an unfortunate passion</s>  life would still be leftto hersuch a life as that which her aunt livedsuch a life withthis exception that whereas her aunt was a single lady with moderatemeans she would be a single lady with very small means indeed</s>  butthat question of means did not go far with her there was somethingso much more important that she could put that out of sight</s>  she hadtold herself very plainly that it was a good thing for a woman to bemarried that she would live and die unsuccessfully if she lived anddied a single woman that she had desired to do better with herselfthan that</s>  was it proper that she should now give up all suchambition because she had made a mistake</s>  if it were proper she woulddo so and then the question resolved itself into thiscould she beright if she married a man without loving him</s>  to marry a man withoutesteeming him without the possibility of loving him hereafter sheknew would be wrong</s> mrs</s>  fenwicks letter was as

all rightno doubt mr</s>  fenwick</s>  the vicar told the constable that he wouldsee to it and get sam brattle to come forward as soon as he could</s> i told you all through mr</s>  fenwick as sam was one of them as wasin it but you wouldnt believe me</s> i dont believe it now said the vicar</s> chapter xlvii</s> sam brattle is wanted</s> the next week was one of considerable perturbation trouble andexcitement at bullhampton and in the neighbourhood of warminsterand heytesbury</s>  it soon became known generally that jack the grinderand lawrence acorn were in salisbury gaol and that sam brattlewaswanted</s>  the perturbation and excitement at bullhampton were ofcourse greater than elsewhere</s>  it was necessary that the old millershould be toldnecessary also that the people at the mill should beasked as to sams present whereabouts</s>  if they did not know it theymight assist the vicar in discovering it</s>  fenwick went to the milltaking the squire with him but they could obtain no information</s>  themiller was very silent and betrayed hardly any emotion when he wastold that the police again wanted his son</s> they can come and search he said</s>  they can come and search</s> and then he walked slowly away into the mill</s>  there was a scene ofcourse with mrs</s>  brattle and fanny and the two women were in a sadway</s> poor boywretched boy</s>  said the unfortunate mother who satsobbing with her apron over her face</s> we know nothing of him mr</s>  gilmore or we would tell at once saidfanny</s> im sure you would said the vicar</s>  and you may remember thismrs</s>  brattle i do not for one moment believe that sam had any moreto do with the murder than you or i</s>  you may tell his father that isay so if you please</s> for saying this the squire rebuked him as soon as they had left themill</s>  i think you go too far in giving such assurance as that hesaid</s> surely you would have me say what i think</s> not on such a matter as this in which any false encouragement mayproduce so much increased suffering</s>  you yourself are so prone totake your own views in opposition to those of others that you shouldbe specially on your guard when you may do so much harm</s> i feel quite sure that he had nothing to do with it</s> you see that you have the police against you after a most minute andprolonged investigation</s> the police are asses insisted the vicar</s> just so</s>  that is you prefer your own opinion to theirs in regard toa murder</s>  i should prefer yours to theirs on a question of scripturalevidence but not in such an affair as this</s>  i dont want to talk youover but i wish to make you careful with other people who are soclosely concerned</s>  in dealing with others you have no right to throwover the ordinary rules of evidence</s> the vicar accepted the rebuke and promised to be morecarefulrepeating however his own opinion about sam to which hedeclared his intention of adhering in regard to his own conduct letthe police and magistrates say what they might</s>  he almost went so faras to declare that he should do so even in opposition to the verdictof a jury but gilmore understood that this was simply the naturalobstinacy of the man showing itself in its natural form</s> at this moment which was certainly one of gloom to the parish atlarge and of great sorrow at the vicarage the squire moved aboutwith a new life which was evident to all who saw him</s>  he went abouthis farm and talked about his trees and looked at his horses andhad come to life again</s>  no doubt many guesses as to the cause of thiswere made throughout his establishment and some of them probablyvery near the truth</s>  but for the fenwicks there was no need ofguessing</s>  gilmore had been told that mary lowther was coming tobullhampton in the early summer and had at once thrown off the cloakof his sadness</s>  he had asked no further questions mrs</s>  fenwick hadfound herself unable to express a caution but the extent of herfriends elation almost frightened her</s> i dont look at it she said to her husband quite as he does</s> shell have him now he answered and then mrs</s>  fenwick saidnothing further</s> to fenwick himself this change was one of infinite comfort</s>  thesquire was his old friend and almost his only near neighbour</s>  in allhis troubles whether inside or outside of the parish he naturallywent to gilmore and although he was a man not very prone to walk bythe advice of friends still it had been a great thing to him to havea friend who would give an opinion and perhaps the more so as thefriend was one who did not insist on having his opinion taken</s>  duringthe past winter gilmore had been of no use whatever to his friend</s> his opinions on all matters had gone so vitally astray that they hadnot been worth having</s>  and he had become so morose that the vicarhad found it to be almost absolutely necessary to leave him alone asfar as ordinary life was concerned</s>  but now the squire was himselfagain and on this exciting topic of trumbulls murder the prisonersin salisbury gaol and the necessity for sams reappearance couldtalk sensibly and usefully</s> it was certainly very expedient that sam should be made to reappearas soon as possible</s>  the idea was general in the parish that thevicar knew all about him</s>  george brattle who had become bail for hisbrothers reappearance had given his name on the clear understandingthat the vicar would be responsible</s>  some halfsustained tidings ofcarrys presence in salisbury and of the vicars various visits tothe city were current in bullhampton and with these were mingled anidea that carry and sam were in league together</s>  that fenwick waschivalrous perhaps quixotic in his friendships for those whom heregarded had long been felt and this feeling was now stronger thanever</s>  he certainly could bring up sam brattle if he pleasedor ifhe pleased as might some said not improbably be the case he couldkeep him away</s>  there would be 400 to pay for the bailbond but thevicar was known to be rich as well as quixotic andso said thepuddlehamiteswould care very little about that if he might thussecure for himself his own way</s> he was constrained to go over again to salisbury in order that hemight if possible learn from carry how to find some trace toher brother and of this visit the puddlehamites also informedthemselves</s>  there were men and women in bullhampton who knew exactlyhow often the vicar had visited the young woman at salisbury howlong he had been with her on each occasion and how much he paid mrs</s> stiggs for the accommodation</s>  gentlemen who are quixotic in theirkindness to young women are liable to have their goings and comingschronicled with much exactitude if not always with accuracy</s> his interview with carry on this occasion was very sad</s>  he could notsave himself from telling her in part the cause of his inquiries</s> they havent taken the two men have they</s>  she asked with aneagerness that seemed to imply that she possessed knowledge on thematter which could hardly not be guilty</s> what two men</s>  he asked looking full into her face</s>  then she wassilent and he was unwilling to catch her in a trap to crossexamineher as a lawyer would do or to press out of her any communicationwhich she would not make willingly and of her own free action</s>  i amtold he said that two men have been taken for the murder</s> where did they find em sir</s> they had escaped to america and the police have brought them back</s> did you know them carry</s>  she was again silent</s>  the men had not beennamed and it was not for her to betray them</s>  hitherto in theirinterviews she had hardly ever looked him in the face but now sheturned her blue eyes full upon him</s>  you told me before at the oldwomans cottage he said that you knew them bothhad known onetoo well</s> if you please sir i wont say nothing about em</s> i will not ask you carry</s>  but you would tell me about your brotherif you knew</s> indeed i would siranything</s>  he hadnt no more to do with farmertrumbulls murder nor you had</s>  they cant touch a hair of his headalong of that</s> such is my beliefbut who can prove it</s>  again she was silent</s> can you prove it</s>  if speaking could save your brother surely youwould speak out</s>  would you hesitate carry in doing anything foryour brothers sake</s>  whatever may be his faults he has not been hardto you like the others</s> oh sir i wish i was dead</s> you must not wish that carry</s>  and if you know ought of this youwill be bound to speak</s>  if you could bring yourself to tell me whatyou know i think it might be good for both of you</s> it was they who had the money</s>  sam never seed a shilling of it</s> who is they</s> jack burrows and larry acorn</s>  and it wasnt larry acorn neithersir</s>  i know very well who did it</s>  it was jack burrows who did it</s> that is he they call the grinder</s> but larry was with him then said the girl sobbing</s> you are sure of that</s> i aint sure of nothing mr</s>  fenwick only that sam wasnt thereat all</s>  of that i am quite quite quite sure</s>  but when you asks mewhat am i to say</s> then he left her without speaking to her on this occasion a wordabout herself</s>  he had nothing to say that would give her any comfort</s> he had almost made up his mind that he would take her over with himto the mill and try what might be done by the meeting between thefather mother and daughter but all this new matter about thepolice and the arrest and sams absence made it almost impossiblefor him to take such a step at present</s>  as he went he againinterrogated mrs</s>  stiggs and was warned by her that words fell dailyfrom her lodger which made her think that the young woman would notremain much longer with her</s>  in the meantime there was nothing ofwhich she could complain</s>  carry insisted on her liberty to go out andabout the city alone but the woman was of opinion that she did thissimply with the object of asserting her independence</s>  after that thenecessary payment was made and the vicar returned to the railwaystation</s>  of sam he had learned nothing and now he did not know whereto go for tidings</s>  he still believed that the young man would come ofhis own accord if the demand for his appearance were made so publicas to reach his ear</s> on that same day there was a meeting of the magistrates atheytesbury and the two men who had been so cruelly fetched back fromsan francisco were brought before it</s>  mr</s>  gilmore was on the benchalong with sir thomas charleys who was the chairman and three othergentlemen</s>  lord trowbridge was in the court house and sat upon thebench but gave it out that he was not sitting there as a magistrate</s> samuel brattle was called upon to answer to his bail and jones theattorney appearing for him explained that he had gone from hometo seek work elsewhere alluded to the length of time that hadelapsed and to the injustice of presuming that a man against whom noevidence had been adduced should be bound to remain always in oneparishand expressed himself without any doubt that mr</s>  fenwickand mr</s>  george brattle who were his bailsmen would cause him to befound and brought forward</s>  as neither the clergyman nor the farmerwere in court nothing further could be done at once and themagistrates were quite ready to admit that time must be allowed</s>  norwas the case at all ready against the two men who were in custody</s> indeed against them the evidence was so little substantial that alawyer from devizes who attended on their behalf expressed hisamazement that the american authorities should have given themup and suggested that it must have been done with some view to asettlement of the alabama claims</s>  evidence however was broughtup to show that the two men had been convicted before the one forburglary and the other for horsestealing that the former johnburrows known as the grinder was a man from devizes with whom thepolice about that town and at chippenham bath and wells werewell acquainted that the other acorn was a young man who had beenrespectable as a partner in a livery stable at birmingham but whohad taken to betting and had for a year past been living by evilcourses having previously undergone two years of imprisonmentwith hard labour</s>  it was proved that they had been seen in theneighbourhood both before and after the murder that boots found inthe cottage at pycroft common fitted certain footmarks in the mudof the farmers yard that burrows had been supplied with a certainpoison at a county chemists at lavington and that the dog bonemhad been poisoned with the like</s>  many other matters were provedall of which were declared by the lawyer from devizes to amount tonothing and by the police authorities who were prosecutors to bevery much</s>  the magistrates of course ordered a remand and orderedalso that on the day named sam brattle should appear</s>  it wasunderstood that that day week was only named pro form theconstables having explained that at least a fortnight would berequired for the collection of further evidence</s>  this took place ontuesday the 25th of april and it was understood that time up to the8th of may would be given to the police to complete their case</s> so far all went on quietly at heytesbury but before the magistratesleft the little town there was a row</s>  sir thomas charleys inspeaking to his brother magistrate mr</s>  gilmore about the wholeaffair and about the brattles in particular had alluded to mr</s> fenwicks unfortunate connexion with carry brattle at salisbury</s> gilmore fired up at once and demanded to know the meaning of this</s> sir thomas who was not the wisest man in the world but who hadideas of justice and as to whom in giving him his due it mustbe owned that he was afraid of no one after some hesitationacknowledged that what he had heard respecting mr</s>  fenwick had fallenfrom lord trowbridge</s>  he had heard from lord trowbridge that thevicar of bullhampton was   </s>  gilmore on the occasion becamefull of energy and pressed the baronet very hard</s>  sir thomas hopedthat mr</s>  gilmore was not going to make mischief</s>  mr</s>  gilmore declaredthat he would not submit to the injury done to his friend and thathe would question lord trowbridge on the subject</s>  he did questionlord trowbridge whom he found waiting for his carriage in theparlour of the bull inn sir thomas having accompanied him in thesearch</s>  the marquis was quite outspoken</s>  he had heard he said fromwhat he did not doubt to be good authority that mr</s>  fenwick wasin the habit of visiting alone a young woman who had lived in hisparish but whom he now maintained in lodgings in a low alley in thesuburbs of salisbury</s>  he had said so much as that</s>  in so saying hadhe spoken truth or falsehood</s>  if he had said anything untrue hewould be the first to acknowledge his own error</s> then there had come to be very hot words</s>  my lord said mr</s> gilmore your insinuation is untrue</s>  whatever your words may havebeen in the impression which they have made they are slanderous</s> who are you sir said the marquis looking at him from head tofoot to talk to me of the impression of my words</s> but mr</s>  gilmores blood was up</s>  you intended to convey to sir thomascharleys my lord that mr</s>  fenwicks visits were of a disgracefulnature</s>  if your words did not convey that they conveyed nothing</s> who are you sir that you should interpret my words</s>  i did no morethan my duty in conveying to sir thomas charleys my convictionmywellgrounded convictionas to the gentlemans conduct</s>  what i saidto him i will say aloud to the whole county</s>  it is notorious that thevicar of bullhampton is in the habit of visiting a profligate youngwoman in a low part of the city</s>  that i say is disgraceful to himto his cloth and to the parish and i shall give my opinion to thebishop to that effect</s>  who are you sir that you should questionmy words</s>  and again the marquis eyed the squire from head to footleaving the room with a majestic strut as gilmore went on to assertthat the allegation made with the sense implied by it containeda wicked and a malicious slander</s>  then there were some words muchquieter than those preceding them between mr</s>  gilmore and sirthomas in which the squire pledged himself tohe hardly knew whatand sir thomas promised to hold his tonguefor the present</s>  butas a matter of course the quarrel flew all over the little town</s>  itwas out of the question that such a man as the marquis of trowbridgeshould keep his wrath confined</s>  before he had left the innyard hehad expressed his opinion very plainly to halfadozen persons bothas to the immorality of the vicar and the impudence of the squireand as he was taken home his hand was itching for pen and paper inorder that he might write to the bishop</s>  sir thomas shrugged hisshoulders and did not tell the story to more than three or fourconfidential friends to all of whom he remarked that on the matterof the visits made to the girl there never was smoke without fire</s> gilmores voice too had been loud and all the servants about theinn had heard him</s>  he knew that the quarrel was already public andfelt that he had no alternative but to tell his friend what hadpassed</s> illustration who are you sir that you should interpretmy words</s> on that same evening he saw the vicar</s>  fenwick had returned fromsalisbury tired dispirited and ill at ease and was just going into dress for dinner when gilmore met him at his own stabledoor andtold him what had occurred</s> then after all my wife was right and i was wrong said fenwick</s> right about what</s>  gilmore asked</s> she said that lord trowbridge would spread these very lies</s>  iconfess that i made the mistake of believing him to be a gentleman</s> of course i may use your information</s> use it just as you please said gilmore</s>  then they parted andgilmore who was on horseback rode home</s> chapter xlviii</s> mary lowther returns to bullhampton</s> a month went by after the scenes described in the last chapter andsummer had come at bullhampton</s>  it was now the end of may and withthe summer mary lowther had arrived</s>  during the month very littleprogress had been made with the case at heytesbury</s>  there had beentwo or three remands and now there was yet another</s>  the policedeclared that this was rendered necessary by the absence of sambrattlethat the magistrates were anxious to give all reasonabletime for the production of the man who was out upon bailand thatas he was undoubtedly concerned in the murder they were determinedto have him</s>  but they who professed to understand the case amongwhom were the lawyer from devizes and mr</s>  jones of heytesburydeclared that no real search had been made for brattle becausethe evidence in regard to the other men was hitherto inefficient</s> the remand now stood again till tuesday june the 5th and it wasunderstood that if brattle did not then appear the bail would bedeclared to have been forfeited</s> fenwick had written a very angry letter to lord trowbridge to whichhe had got no answer and lord trowbridge had written a very sillyletter to the bishop in replying to which the bishop had snubbedhim</s>  i am informed by my friend mr</s>  gilmore said the vicar tothe marquis that your lordship has stated openly that i have madevisits to a young woman in salisbury which are disgraceful to me tomy cloth and to the parish of which i am the incumbent</s>  i do notbelieve that your lordship will deny that you have done so and itherefore call upon you at once to apologise to me for the calumnywhich in its nature is as injurious and wicked as calumny canbe and to promise that you will not repeat the offence</s>  themarquis when he received this had not as yet written that letterto the bishop on which he had resolved after his interview withgilmorefeeling perhaps some qualms of conscience thinking thatit might be well that he should consult his sonthough with afull conviction that if he did so his son would not allow him towrite to the bishop at allpossibly with some feeling that he hadbeen too hard upon his enemy the vicar</s>  but when the letter frombullhampton reached him all feelings of doubt caution and mercywere thrown to the winds</s>  the tone of the letter was essentiallyaggressive and impudent</s>  it was the word calumny that offended himmost that and the idea that he the marquis of trowbridge shouldbe called upon to promise not to commit an offence</s>  the pestilentinfidel at bullhampton as he called our friend had not attempted todeny the visits to the young woman at salisbury</s>  and the marquis hadmade fresh inquiry which had completely corroborated his previousinformation</s>  he had learned mrs</s>  stiggss address and the name oftrotters buildings which details were to his mind circumstantialcorroborative and damnatory</s>  some dim account of the battle at thethree honest men had reached him and the undoubted fact that carrybrattle was maintained by the vicar</s>  then he remembered all fenwicksold anxiety on behalf of the brother whom the marquis had taughthimself to regard as the very man who had murdered his tenant</s> he reminded himself too of the murderers present escape fromjustice by aid of this pestilent clergyman and thus becameconvinced that in dealing with mr</s>  fenwick as it was his undoubtedduty to do he had to deal with one of the very worst of the humanrace</s>  his lordships mind was one utterly incapable of siftingevidenceunable even to understand evidence when it came to him</s> he was not a bad man</s>  he desired nothing that was not his own andremitted much that was</s>  he feared god honoured the queen and lovedhis country</s>  he was not selfindulgent</s>  he did his duties as he knewthem</s>  but he was an arrogant old fool who could not keep himselffrom mischiefwho could only be kept from mischief by the aid ofsome such master as his son</s>  as soon as he received the vicarsletter he at once sat down and wrote to the bishop</s>  he was so surethat he was right that he sent fenwicks letter to the bishopacknowledging what he himself had said at heytesbury and justifyingit altogether by an elaborate account of the vicars wickedness</s>  andnow my lord let me ask you said he in conclusion whether youdeem this a proper man to have the care of souls in the large andimportant parish of bullhampton</s> the bishop felt himself to be very much bullied</s>  he had no doubtwhatsoever about his parson</s>  he knew that fenwick was too strong aman to be acted upon beneficially by such advice as to his privateconduct as a bishop might give and too good a man to need anycaution as to his conduct</s>  my lord marquis he said in reply inreturning the endorsed letter from mr</s>  fenwick to your lordship ican only say that nothing has been brought before me by your lordshipwhich seems to me to require my interference</s>  i should be wrong if idid not add to this the expression of my opinion that mr</s>  fenwick isa moral man doing his duty in his parish well and an example in mydiocese to be followed rather than a stumbling block</s> when this letter reached the castle lord st</s>  george was there</s>  thepoor old marquis was cut to the quick</s>  he immediately perceivedsohe told himselfthat the bishop was an old woman who understoodnothing but he was sure that st</s>  george would not look at the matterin the same light</s>  and yet it was impossible not to tell st</s>  george</s> much as he dreaded his son he did honestly tell everything to hismentor</s>  he had already told st</s>  george of fenwicks letter to himand of his letter to the bishop and st</s>  george had whistled</s>  now heshowed the bishops letter to his son</s>  st</s>  george read the letterrefolded it slowly shrugged his shoulders and said as he returnedit to his fatherwell my lord i suppose you like a hornets nest</s> this was the uncomfortable position of things at bullhampton aboutthe beginning of june at which time mary lowther was again stayingwith her friend mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  carry brattle was still at salisburybut had not been seen by the vicar for more than a fortnight</s>  themarquiss letter backed as it was in part by his wifes counselhad much to his own disgust deterred him from seeing the girl</s>  hiswife however had herself visited trotters buildings and had seencarry taking to her a little present from her mother who did notdare to go over to salisbury to see her child because of words thathad passed between her and her husband</s> mrs</s>  fenwick on her return home had reported that carry was silentsullen and idle that her only speech was an expression of a wishthat she was dead and that mrs</s>  stiggs had said that she could getno good of her</s>  in the meantime sam brattle had not yet turned upand the 5th of june was at hand</s> mary lowther was again at the vicarage and of course it wasnecessary that she and mr</s>  gilmore should meet each other</s>  a promisehad been made to her that no advice should be pressed upon herthemeaning of which of course was that nothing should be said to herurging her to marry mr</s>  gilmore</s>  but it was of course understood byall the parties concerned that mr</s>  gilmore was to be allowed to cometo the house and indeed this was understood by the fenwicks tomean almost as plainly that she would at least endeavour to bringherself to accept him when he did come</s>  to mary herself as she madethe journey the same meaning seemed to be almost inevitable and asshe perceived this she told herself that she had been wrong to leavehome</s>  she knewshe thought she knewthat she must refuse him andin doing so would simply be making fresh trouble</s>  would it not havebeen better for her to have remained at loringto have put herselfat once on a par with her aunt and have commenced her life ofsolitary spinsterhood and dull routine</s>  but then why should sherefuse him</s>  she endeavoured to argue it out with herself in therailway carriage</s>  she had been told that walter marrable wouldcertainly marry edith brownlow and she believed it</s>  no doubt it wasmuch better that he should do so</s>  at any rate she and walter wereseparated for ever</s>  when he wrote to her declaring his purposeof remaining in england he had said not a word of renewing hisengagement with her</s>  no doubt she loved him</s>  about that she did notfor a moment endeavour to deceive herself</s>  no doubt if that fate inlife which she most desired might be hers she would become the wifeof walter marrable</s>  but that fate would not be hers and then therearose the question whether on that account she was unfit to be thewife of any other man</s>  of this she was quite certain that should itever seem to her to be her duty to accept the other man she wouldfirst explain to him clearly the position in which she found herself</s> at last the whole matter resolved itself to thiswas it possiblefor her to divest her idea of life of all romance and to look forcontentment and satisfaction in the performance of duties to others</s> the prospect of an old maids life at loring was not pleasant to hereyes but she would bear that and worse than that rather than dowrong</s>  it was however so hard for her to know what was right andwhat was wrong</s>  supposing that she were to consent to marry mr</s> gilmore would she be forsworn when at the altar she promised to lovehim</s>  all her care would be henceforth for him all her heart as faras she could command her heart and certainly all her truth</s>  thereshould not be a secret of her mind hidden from him</s>  she would forceherself to love him and to forget that other man</s>  he should be theobject of all her idolatry</s>  she would in that case do her veryutmost to reward him for the constancy of the affection with which hehad regarded her and yet as she was driven in at the vicarage gateshe told herself that it would have been better for her to remain atloring</s> during the first evening mr</s>  gilmores name was not mentioned</s>  therewere subjects enough for conversation as the period was one of greatexcitement in bullhampton</s> what did you think of our chapel</s>  asked mrs</s>  fenwick</s> i had no idea it was so big</s> why they are not going to leave us a single soul to go to church</s> mr</s>  puddleham means to make a clean sweep of the parish</s> you dont mean to say that any have left you</s> well none as yet replied mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  but then the chapel isntfinished and the marquis has not yet sent his order to his tenantsto become dissenters</s>  we expect that he will do so unless he canpersuade the bishop to turn frank out of the living</s> but the bishop couldnt turn him out</s> of course he couldntand wouldnt if he could</s>  the bishop andfrank are the best friends in the world</s>  but that has nothing to dowith it</s>  you mustnt abuse the chapel to frank just at this momentthe subject is tabooed</s>  my belief is that the whole edifice will haveto come down and that the confusion of mr</s>  puddleham and the marquiswill be something more complete than ever was yet seen</s>  in themeantime i put my finger to my lip and just look at frank wheneverthe chapel is mentioned</s> and then there was the matter of the murder and the somewhat sadconsideration of sams protracted absence</s> and will you have to pay four hundred pounds mr</s>  fenwick</s>  maryasked</s> i shall be liable to pay it if he does not appear tomorrow and nodoubt must absolutely pay it if he does not turn up soon</s> but you dont think that he was one of them</s> i am quite sure he was not</s>  but he has had trouble in his familyand he got into a quarrel and i fancy he has left the country</s>  thepolice say that he has been traced to liverpool</s> and will the other men be convicted</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick asked</s> i believe they will and most fervently hope so</s>  they have someevidence about the wheels of a small cart in which burrows certainlyand i believe no doubt acorn also were seen to drive acrosspycroft common early on the sunday morning</s>  a part of the tire hadcome off and another bit somewhat broader and an inch or so tooshort had been substituted</s>  the impress made by this wheel in themud just round the corner by the farm gate was measured and copiedat the time and they say that this will go far to identify the men</s> that the mans cart was there is certainalso that he was in thesame cart at pycroft common an hour or two after the murder</s> that does seem clear said mary</s> but somebody suggests that sam had borrowed the cart</s>  i believehowever that it will all come outonly if i have to pay fourhundred pounds i shall think that farmer trumbull has cost me verydear</s> on the next morning gilmore came to the vicarage</s>  it had beenarranged that he would drive fenwick over to heytesbury and that hewould call for him after breakfast</s>  a somewhat late hourtwo in theafternoonhad been fixed for going on with the murder case as itwas necessary that a certain constable should come down from londonon that morning and therefore there would be no need for the twomen to start very early from bullhampton</s>  this was explained to maryby mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  he dines here today she had said when they metin the morning before prayers and you may as well get over thefirst awkwardness at once</s>  mary had assented to this and afterbreakfast gilmore made his appearance among them in the garden</s>  hewas just one moment alone with the girl he loved</s> miss lowther he said i cannot be with you for an instant withouttelling you that i am unchanged</s> mary made no reply and he said nothing further</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick waswith them so quickly that there was no need for a replyand then hewas gone</s>  during the whole day the two friends talked of the murderand of the brattles and the chapelwhich was thoroughly inspectedfrom the roof to the floorbut not a word was said about theloves of harry gilmore or walter marrable</s>  gilmores name was oftenmentioned as the whole story was told of lord trowbridges newquarrel and of the correspondence with the bishopof which fenwickhad learned the particulars from the bishops chaplain</s>  and in thetelling of this story mrs</s>  fenwick did not scruple to express heropinion that harry gilmore had behaved well with good spirit andlike a true friend</s>  if the marquis had been anywhere near his ownage i believe he would have horsewhipped him said the vicars wifewith that partiality for the corporal chastisement of an enemy whichis certainly not uncommon to the feminine mind</s>  this was all verywell and called for no special remark from mary and possibly mighthave an effect</s> the gentlemen returned late in the evening and the squire dressed atthe vicarage</s>  but the great event of the day had to be told beforeanyone was allowed to dress</s>  between four and five oclock just asthe magistrates were going to leave the bench sam brattle had walkedinto court</s> and your money is safe</s>  said his wife</s> yes my money is safe but i declare i think more of sams truth</s> he was there as it seemed all of a sudden</s>  the police had learnednothing of him</s>  he just walked into the court and we heard hisvoice</s>  they tell me im wanted he said and so he gave himselfup</s> and what was done</s>  asked his wife</s> it was too late to do anything so they allowed a remand for anotherweek and sam was walked off to prison</s> at dinner time the conversation was still about the murder</s>  it hadbeen committed after mary lowther had left bullhampton but she hadheard all the details and was now as able to be interested aboutit as were the others</s>  it was gilmores opinion that instead ofproceeding against sam they would put him into the witnessbox andmake him tell what he knew about the presence of the other two men</s> fenwick declared that if they did so such was sams obstinacy thathe would tell nothing</s>  it was his own ideaas he had explainedboth to his wife and to gilmorethat carry brattle could give moreevidence respecting the murder than her brother</s>  of this he saidnothing at present but he had informed constable toffy that ifcaroline brattle were wanted for the examination she would be foundat the house of mrs</s>  stiggs</s> thus for an hour or two the peculiar awkwardness of the meetingbetween harry gilmore and mary was removed</s>  he was enabled totalk with energy on a matter of interest and she could join theconversation</s>  but when they were round the teatable it seemed to bearranged by common consent that trumbulls murder and the brattlesshould for a while be laid aside</s>  then mary became silent andgilmore became awkward</s>  when inquiries were made as to miss marrablehe did not know whether to seem to claim or not to claim thatladys acquaintance</s>  he could not of course allude to his visitto loring and yet he could hardly save himself from having toacknowledge that he had been there</s>  however the hour wore itselfaway and he was allowed to take his departure</s> during the next two days he did not see mary lowthcr</s>  on the fridayhe met her with mrs</s>  fenwick as the two were returning from the mill</s> they had gone to visit mrs</s>

had finished and she stood before himwaitingher doom</s> his brow had become black and still blacker as she continued herspeech</s>  he had kept his eyes upon her without quailing for a momentand had

in support of his ownidea amounted to little more than thisthat he would go for thegirl because the marquis of trowbridge would be sure to condemnhim for taking such a step</s>  it is intolerable to me he saidthat i should be impeded in my free action by the interference andaccusations of such an ass as that</s>  but the question was one onwhich his wife felt herself to be so strong that she

one of the murderers</s>  as a witness hewas adjudged to have behaved badly but the assumed independence ofhis demeanour was probably the worst of his misbehaviour</s>  he wouldtell them nothing of the circumstances of the murder except thathaving previously become acquainted with the two men burrows andacorn and having as he thought a spite against the vicar at thetime he had determined to make free with some of the vicarage fruit</s> he had he said met the men in the village that afternoon andhad no knowledge of their business there</s>  he had known acorn moreintimately than the other man

every now and again hadcrept on a few feet as her courage came to her and at last by thewell known little path she had crept down behind the mill crossingthe stream by the board which had once been so

resultof all the inquiries made in regard to the murder did in truthcontain no tittle of evidence against sam</s>  as constables goconstable toffy was a good man and he would be wronged if it were tobe said of him that he regretted sams escape but his nature was asis the nature of constables and he could not rid himself of thatfeeling of disappointment which always attends baffled efforts</s>  andthough he saw that there was no evidence against sam he did nottherefore necessarily think that the young man was innocent</s>  it maybe doubted whether to the normal policemans mind any man is everaltogether absolved of any crime with which that mans name hasbeen once connected</s>  he felt therefore somewhat sore against thebrattlesand then there was the fact that carry brattle who hadbeen regularly subpoenaed had kept herself out of the waymostflagitiously illegally and damnably</s>  she had run off from salisburyjust as though she were a free person to do as she pleased withherself and not subject to police orders</s>  when therefore he heardthat carry was at the millshe having made herself liable to someterribly heavy fine by her contumacyit was manifestly his duty tosee after her and let her know that she was wanted</s> at the mill he saw only the miller himself and his visit was notaltogether satisfactory</s>  old brattle who understood very little ofthe case but who did understand that his own son had been made clearin reference to that accusation had no idea that his daughter hadany concern with that matter other than what had fallen to her lotin reference to her

with the requirements of the law the millerturned upon him and declared that if anybody said a word against sambrattle in reference to the murderthe magistrates having settledthat matterhe jacob brattle old as he was would see it outwith that malignant slanderer</s>  constable toffy did his best to makethe matter clear to the miller but failed utterly</s>  had he a warrantto search for anybody</s>  toffy had no warrant</s>  toffy only desired toknow whether caroline brattle was or was not beneath her fathersroof</s>  the old miller declaring to himself that though his child hadshamed him he would not deny her now that she was again one of thefamily acknowledged so much but refused the constable admittance tothe house</s> but mr</s>  brattle said the constable she was subpoenaed</s> i know nowt o that answered the miller not deigning to turn hisface round to his antagonist</s> but you know mr</s>  brattle the law must have its course</s> no i dont</s>  and it aint law as you should come here a hindering ome and it aint law as you should walk that unfortunate young womanoff with you to prison</s> but shes wanted mr</s>  brattlenot in the way of going to prisonbut before the magistrates</s> theres a deal of things is wanted as aint to be had</s>  anyways youaint no call to my house now and as them as is there is in troubleill ax you to be so kind asas just to leave us alone</s> toffy pretending that he was satisfied with the informationreceived and merely adding that caroline brattle must certainlyat some future time be made to appear before the magistrates atheytesbury took his departure with more goodhumour than the millerdeserved from him and returned to the village</s> chapter liv</s> mr</s>  gilmores rubies</s> mary lowther struggled

could love the man whom she hadpromised to marry</s>  and yet this letter so affected her that she toldherself that she would go on and become the wife of harry gilmore</s> she would struggle yet

see</s>  dunripple 2nd july 1868</s>  dear mary i got your letter on saturday and cannot help wishing that it had been written in better spirits</s>  however i do not doubt but that it will all come right soon</s>  i am quite sure that the best thing you can do is to let mr</s>  gilmore name an early day</s>  of course you never intended that there should be a long engagement</s>  such a thing where there is no possible reason for it must be out of the question</s>  and it will be much better to take advantage of the fine weather than to put it off till the winter has nearly come</s>  fix some day in august or early in september</s>  i am sure you will be much happier married than you are single and he will be gratified which is i suppose to count for something</s>  i am very happy

fear in a bad way</s>  he is unlike his father and laughs at his own ailments but everybody in the houseexcept perhaps sir gregoryknows that he is very ill</s>  he never comes down at all now but lives in two rooms which he has together upstairs</s>  we go and see him every day but he is hardly able to talk to any one</s>  sir gregory never mentions the subject to me but mrs</s>  brownlow is quite confident that if anything were to happen to gregory marrable walter would be asked to come to dunripple as the heir and to give up the army altogether</s>  i get on very well with mrs</s>  brownlow but of course we cannot be like old friends</s>  edith is a very nice girl but rather shy</s>  she never talks about herself and is too silent to be questioned</s>  i do not however doubt for a moment but that she will be walter marrables wife</s>  i think it likely that they are not engaged as yet as in that case i think mrs</s>  brownlow would tell me but many things have been said which leave on my mind a conviction that it will be so</s>  he is to be here again in august and from the way in which mrs</s>  brownlow speaks of his coming there is no doubt that she expects it</s>  that he paid great attention to edith when he was here before i am quite sure and i take it he is only waiting tillin writing so far miss marrable had intended to signify that captainmarrable had been slow to ask edith brownlow to be his wife while hewas at dunripple because he could not bring himself so soon to showhimself indifferent to his former love but that now he would nothesitate knowing as he would know that his former love had bestowedherself elsewhere but in this there would have been a grievousaccusation against mary and she was therefore compelled to fill upher sentence in some other

john will expect to marry you but mr</s>  fenwick might come and assist</s>  your most affectionate aunt sarah marrable</s> it was not the entreaty made by her aunt that an early day shouldbe fixed for the marriage which made mary lowther determine thatshe would yet once more attempt to drag the wagon</s>  she could havewithstood such entreaty as that and had the letter gone no furtherwould probably have replied to it by saying that no day could befixed at all</s>  but with the letter there came an assurance thatwalter marrable had forgotten her was about to marry edith brownlowand that therefore all ideas of love and truth and sympathy and jointbeating of mutual hearts with the rest of it might be thrown to thewinds</s>  she would marry harry gilmore and take care that he had gooddinners and would give her mind to flannel petticoats and coal forthe poor of bullhampton and would altogether come down from thepedestal which she had once striven to erect for herself</s>  from thathigh but tottering pedestal propped up on shafts of romance andpoetry she would come down but there would remain for her thelower firmer standing block of which duty was the sole support</s>  itwas no doubt most unreasonable that any such change should come uponher in consequence of her aunts letter</s>  she had never for a momenttold herself that walter marrable could ever be anything to hersince that day on which she had by her own deed liberated him fromhis troth and indeed had done more than that had forced him toaccept that liberation</s>  why then should his engagement with anotherwoman have any effect with her either in one direction or in theother</s>  she herself had submitted to a new engagementhad done sobefore he had shown any sign of being fickle</s>  she could not thereforebe angry with him</s>  and yet because he could be fickle because hecould do that very thing which she had openly declared her purpose ofdoing she persuaded herselffor a week or twothat any sacrificemade to him would be a sacrifice to folly and a neglect of duty</s> at this time during this week or two there came to her direct fromthe jewellers in london a magnificent set of rubiesearringsbrooch bracelets and necklace</s>  the rubies she had seen before andknew that they had belonged to mr</s>  gilmores mother</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick hadtold him that the setting was so old that no lady could wear themnow and there had been a presentiment that they would be forthcomingin a new form</s>  mary had said that of course such ornaments as thesewould come into her hands only when she became mrs</s>  gilmore</s>  mrs</s> fenwick had laughed and told her that she did not understand theromantic generosity of her lover</s>  and now the jewellery had come toher at the parsonage without a word from gilmore and was spread outin its pretty cases on the vicarage drawingroom table</s>  now if evermust she say that she could not do as she had promised</s> mary said mrs</s>  fenwick you must go up to him tomorrow and tellhim how noble he is</s> mary waited perhaps for a whole minute before she answered</s>  shewould willingly have given the jewels away for ever and ever so thatthey might not have been there now to trouble her</s>
he is noble she said slowly and i will go and tell him so</s>  illgo now if it is not too late</s> do do</s>  youll be sure to find him</s>  and mrs</s>  fenwick in herenthusiasm embraced her friend and kissed her</s> mary put on her hat and walked off at once through the garden andacross the fields and into the privets and close to the house shemet her lover</s>  he did not see her till he heard her step and thenturned short round almost as though fearing something</s> harry she said those jewels have come</s>  oh dear</s>  they are notmine yet</s>  why did you have them sent to me</s> there was something in the word yet or in her tone as she spoke itwhich made his heart leap as it had never leaped before</s> if theyre not yours i dont know whom they belong to he said</s> and his eye was bright and his voice almost shook with emotion</s> are you doing anything</s>  she asked</s> nothing on earth</s> then come and see them</s> so they walked off and he at any rate on that occasion was a happylover</s>  for a few minutesperhaps for an hourhe did allow himselfto believe that he was destined to enjoy that rapture of requitedaffection in longing for which his very soul had become sick</s>  as shewalked back with him to the vicarage her hand rested heavily on hisarm and when she asked him some question about his land she wasable so to modulate her voice as to make him believe that she waslearning to regard his interests as her own</s>  he stopped her at thegate leading into the vicarage garden and once more made to her anassurance of his regard</s> mary he said if love will beget love i think that you must loveme at last</s> i will love you she said pressing his arm still more closely</s>  buteven then she could not bring herself to tell him that she did lovehim</s> chapter lv</s> glebe land</s> the fifteenth of july was a sunday and it had been settled for sometime past that on this day mr</s>  puddleham would preach for the firsttime in his new chapel</s>  the building had been hurried on through theearly summer in order that this might be achieved and although thefittings were not completed and the outward signs of the masons andlabourers had not been removedalthough the heaps of mortar werestill there and time had not yet sufficed to have the chips clearedawayon sunday the fifteenth of july the chapel was opened</s>  greatefforts were made to have it filled on the occasion</s>  the builderfrom salisbury came over with all his family not deterred by theconsideration that whereas the puddlehamites of bullhampton wereprimitive methodists he was a regular wesleyan</s>  and many in theparish were got to visit the chapel on this the day of its glory whohad less business there than even the builder from salisbury</s>  in mostparishes there are some who think it well to let the parson know thatthey are independent and do not care for him though they professto be of his flock and then too the novelty of the thing had itsattraction and the wellknown fact that the site chosen for thebuilding had been as gall and wormwood to the parson and his family</s> these causes together brought a crowd to the vicaragegate on thatsunday morning and it was quite clear that the new chapel would befull and that mr</s>  puddlehams first sunday would be a success</s>  andthe chapel of course had a bella bell which was declared by mrs</s> fenwick to be the hoarsest loudest most unmusical and illfoundedmiscreant of a bell that was ever suspended over a building for thetorture of delicate ears</s>  it certainly was a loud and brazen bellbut mr</s>  fenwick expressed his opinion that there was nothing amisswith it</s>  when his wife declared that it sounded as though it camefrom the midst of the shrubs at their own front gate he remindedher that their own church bells sounded as though they came from thelower garden</s>  that one sound should be held by them to be musicaland the other abominable he declared to be a prejudice</s>  then therewas a great argument about the bells in which mrs</s>  fenwick andmary lowther and harry gilmore were all against the vicar</s>  andthroughout the discussion it was known to them all that there wereno ears in the parish to which the bells were so really odious asthey were to the ears of the vicar himself</s>  in his heart of heartshe hated the chapel and in spite of all his endeavours to thecontrary his feelings towards mr</s>  puddleham were not those whichthe christian religion requires one neighbour to bear to another</s> but he made the struggle and for some weeks past had not said aword against mr</s>  puddleham</s>  in regard to the marquis the thing wasdifferent</s>  the marquis should have known better and against themarquis he did say a great many words</s> they began to ring the bell on that sunday morning before tenoclock</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick was still sitting at the breakfasttable withthe windows open when the sound was first heardfirst heard thatis on that morning</s>  she looked at mary groaned and put her handsto her ears</s>  the vicar laughed and walked about the room</s> at what time do they begin</s>  said mary</s> not till eleven said mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  there it wants a quarter toten now and they mean to go on with that music for an hour and aquarter</s> we shall be keeping them company byandby said the vicar</s> the poor old church bells wont be heard through it said mrs</s> fenwick</s> mrs</s>  fenwick was in the habit of going to the village school for halfan hour before the service on sunday mornings and on this morningshe started from the house according to her custom at a little afterten</s>  mary lowther went with her and as the school was in the villageand could be reached much more shortly by the front gate than by thepath round by the church the two ladies walked out boldly before thenew chapel</s>  the reader may perhaps remember that mrs</s>  fenwick hadpromised her husband to withdraw that outward animosity to the chapelwhich she had evinced by not using the vicarage entrance</s>  as theywent there was a crowd collected and they found that after themanner of the primitive methodists in their more enthusiastic daysa procession of worshippers had been formed in the village which atthis very moment was making its way to the chapel</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick asshe stood aside to make way for them declared that the bell soundedas though it were within her bonnet</s>  when they reached the schoolthey found that many a child was absent who should have been thereand mrs</s>  fenwick knew that the truant urchins were amusing themselvesat the new building</s>  and with those who were not truant the clang ofthe new bell distracted terribly that attention which was due to thecollect</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick herself confessed afterwards that she hardlyknew what she was teaching</s> mr</s>  fenwick according to his habit went into his own study when theladies went to the school and there according to custom also onsunday mornings his letters were brought to him some few minutesbefore he started on his walk through the garden to the church</s>  onthis morning there were a couple of letters for himself and heopened them both</s>  one was from a tradesman in salisbury and theother was from his wifes brotherinlaw mr</s>  quickenham</s>  before hestarted he read mr</s>  quickenhams letter and then did his best toforget it and put it out of his mind till the morning service shouldbe over</s>  the letter was as follows pump court june 30 1868</s>  dear fenwick i have found as i thought i should that lord trowbridge has no property in or right whatever to the bit of ground on which your enemies have been building their new ebenezer</s>  the spot is a part of the glebe and as such seems to have been first abandoned by a certain parson named brandon who was your predecessors predecessor</s>  there can however be no doubt that the ground is glebe and that you are bound to protect it as such on behalf of your successors and of the patrons of the living</s>  i found some difficulty in getting at the terrier of the parishwhich you who consider yourself to be a model parson i dare say have never seen</s>  i have however found it in duplicate</s>  the clerk of the board of guardians who should i believe have a copy of it knew nothing about it and had never heard of such a document</s>  your bishops registrar was not much more learnedbut i did find it in the bishops chancery and there is a copy of it also at saint johns which seems to imply that great attention has been paid by the college as patron to the interests of the parish priest</s>  this is more than has been done by the incumbent who seems to be an ignorant fellow in such matters</s>  i wonder how many parsons there are in the church who would let a marquis and a methodist minister between them build a chapel on the parish glebe</s>  yours ever richard quickenham</s>  if i were to charge you through an attorney for my trouble youd have to mortgage your life interest in the bit of land to pay me</s>  i enclose a draft from the terrier as far as the plot of ground and the vicaragegate are concerned</s> here was information</s>  this detestable combination of dissentingand tyrannically territorial influences had been used to build amethodist chapel upon land of which he during his incumbency in theparish was the freehold possessor</s>  what an ass he must have beennot to know his own possessions</s>  how ridiculous would he appear whenhe should come forward to claim as a part of the glebe a morsel ofland to which he had paid no special attention whatever since he hadbeen in the parish</s>  and then what would it be his duty to do</s>  mr</s> quickenham had clearly stated that on behalf of the college whichwas the patron of the living and on behalf of his successors it washis duty to claim the land</s>  and was it possible that he should notdo so after such usage as he had received from lord trowbridge</s>  someditatingbut grieving that he should be driven at such a momentto have his mind forcibly filled with such mattersstill hearingthe chapel bell which in his ears drowned the sound from his ownmodest belfry and altogether doubtful as to what step he would takehe entered his own church</s>  it was manifest to him that of the poorerpart of his usual audience and of the smaller farmers one half werein attendance upon mr</s>  puddlehams triumph</s> during the whole of that afternoon he said not a word of thebarristers letter to any one</s>  he struggled to banish the subjectfrom his thoughts</s>  failing to do that he did banish it from histongue</s>  the letter was in the pocket of his coat but he showed it tono one</s>  gilmore dined at the vicarage but even to him he was silent</s> of course the conversation at dinner turned upon the chapel</s>  it wasimpossible that on such a day they should speak of anything else</s> even as they sat at their early dinner mr</s>  puddlehams bell wasringing and no doubt there was a vigour in the pulling of it whichwould not be maintained when the pulling of it should have become athing of every week</s>  there had been a compact made in accordancewith which the vicars wife was to be debarred from saying anythingagainst the chapel and no doubt when the compact was made theunderstanding was that she should give over hating the chapel</s>  thishad of course been found to be impossible but in a certain way shehad complied with the compact</s>  the noise of the bell however wasconsidered to be beyond the compact and on this occasion she wasalmost violent in the expression of her wrath</s>  her husband listenedto her and sat without rebuking her silent with the lawyersletter in his pocket</s>  this bell had been put up on his own land andhe could pull it down tomorrow</s>  it had been put up by the expressagency of lord trowbridge and with the direct view of annoying himand lord trowbridge had behaved to him in a manner which set allchristian charity at defiance</s>  he told himself plainly that he had nodesire to forgive lord trowbridgethat life in this world as it isconstituted would not be compatible with such forgivenessthat hewould not indeed desire to injure lord trowbridge otherwise than byexacting such penalty as would force him and such as he to restraintheir tyranny but that to forgive him till he should have been soforced would be weak and injurious to the community</s>  as to that hehad quite made up his mind in spite of all doctrine to the contrary</s> men in this world would have to go naked if they gave their coatsto the robbers who took their cloaks and going naked is manifestlyinexpedient</s>  his office of parish priest would be lowered in theworld if he forgave out of hand such offences as these which hadbeen committed against him by lord trowbridge</s>  this he understoodclearly</s>  and now he might put down not only the bell but with thebell the illconditioned peer who had caused it to be put uponglebe land</s>  all this went through his mind again and again as hedetermined that on that day being sunday he would think no moreabout it</s> when the monday came it was necessary that he should show the letterto his wifeto his wife and to the squire and to mary lowther</s>  hehad no idea of keeping the matter secret from his near friends andadvisers but he had an idea that it would be well that he shouldmake up his mind as to what he would do before he asked their advice</s> he started therefore for a turn through the parish before breakfaston monday morningand resolved as to his course of action</s>  on noconsideration whatever would he have the chapel pulled down</s>  it wasnecessary for his purpose that he should have his triumph over themarquisand he would have it</s>  but the chapel had been built for agood purpose which it would adequately serve and let what might besaid to him by his wife or others he would not have a brick of itdisturbed</s>  no doubt he had no more power to give the land for itspresent or any other purpose than had the marquis</s>  it might veryprobably be his duty to take care that the land was not appropriatedto wrong purposes</s>  it might be that he had already neglected hisduty in not knowing or in not having taken care to learn theprecise limits of the glebe which had been given over to him forhis use during his incumbency</s>  nevertheless there was the chapeland there it should stand as far as he was concerned</s>  if thechurchwardens or the archdeacon or the college or the bishop hadpower to interfere as to which he was altogether ignorant and choseto exercise that power he could not help it</s>  he was nearly sure thathis own churchwardens would be guided altogether by himselfand asfar as he was concerned the chapel should remain unmolested</s>  havingthus resolved he came back to breakfast and read mr</s>  quickenhamsletter aloud to his wife and mary lowther</s> glebe</s>  said the vicars wife</s> do you mean that it is part of your own land</s>  asked mary</s> exactly that said the vicar</s> and that old thief of a marquis has given away what belongs to us</s> said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> he has given away what did not belong to himself said the vicar</s> but i cant admit that hes a thief</s> surely he ought to have known said mary</s> as for that so ought i to have known i suppose</s>  the whole thingis one of the most ridiculous mistakes that ever was made</s>  it hasabsolutely come to pass that here in the middle of wiltshire withall our maps and surveys and parish records no one concerned hasknown to whom belonged a quarter of an acre of land in the centreof the village</s>  it is just a thing to write an article about in anewspaper but i cant say that one party is more to blame than theother that is in regard to the ignorance displayed</s> and what will you do frank</s> nothing</s> you will do nothing frank</s> i will do nothing but i will take care to let the marquis know thenature of his generosity</s>  i fancy that i am bound to take on myselfthat labour and i must say that it wont trouble me much to have towrite the letter</s> you wont pull it down frank</s> no my dear</s> i would before a week was over</s> so would i said mary</s>  i dont think it ought to be there</s> of course it ought not to be there said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> they might as well have it here in the garden said mary</s> just the same said mrs</s>  fenwick</s> it is not in the garden and as it has been built it shallremainas far as i am concerned</s>  i shall rather like it now thati know i am the landlord</s>  i think i shall claim a sitting</s>  this wasthe vicars decision on the monday morning and from that decisionthe two ladies were quite unable to move him</s> this occurred a day or two after the affair of the rubies and ata time when mary was being very hard pressed to name a day for herwedding</s>  of course such pressure had been the result of mr</s>  gilmoressuccess on that occasion</s>  she had then resolutely gone to work toovercome her own and his melancholy gloom and having in a greatdegree succeeded it was only natural that he should bring up thatquestion of his marriage day</s>  she when she had accepted him haddone so with a stipulation that she should not be hurried but we allknow what such stipulations are worth</s>  who is to define what is andwhat is not hurry</s>  they had now been engaged a month and the squirewas clearly of opinion that there had been no hurry</s>  september wasthe nicest month in the year he said for getting married andgoing abroad</s>  september in switzerland october among the italianlakes november in florence and rome</s>  so that they might get homebefore christmas after a short visit to naples</s>  that was thesquires programme and his whole manner was altered as he made it</s> he thought he knew the nature of the girl well enough to be surethat though she would profess no passionate love for him beforestarting on such a journey she would change her tone before shereturned</s>  it should be no fault of his if she did not change it</s>  maryhad at first declined to fix any day had talked of next year haddeclared that she would not be hurried</s>  she had carried on the fighteven after the affair of the rubies but she had fought in oppositionto strong and welldisciplined forces on the other side and she hadbegun to admit to herself that it might be expedient that she shouldyield</s>  the thing was to be done and why not have it done at once</s> she had not as yet yielded but she had begun to think that she wouldyield</s> at such a period it was of course natural that the squire shouldbe daily at the vicarage and on this monday morning he came downwhile the minds of all his friends there were intent on the strangeinformation received from mr</s>  quickenham</s>  the vicar was not by whenmr</s>  gilmore was told and he was thus easily induced to join inthe opinion that the chapel should be made to disappear</s>  he had alandlords idea about land and was thoroughly welldisposed to stopany encroachment on

almost moved to tears by the tragedy of the occasion</s> illustration mr</s>  quickenhams letter discussed</s> then the vicar joined them and the matter was earnestly debatedsoearnestly that on that occasion not a word was said as to the dayof the wedding</s> chapter lvi</s> the vicars vengeance</s> no eloquence on the part of the two ladies at the vicarage or of thesquire could turn mr</s>  fenwick from his purpose but he did consentat last to go over with the squire to salisbury and to consult mr</s> chamberlaine</s>  a proposition was made to him as to consulting thebishop for whom personally he always expressed a liking and whoseoffice he declared that he held in the highest veneration but heexplained that this was not a matter in which the bishop should beinvited to exercise authority</s> the bishop has nothing to do with my freehold he said</s> but if you want an opinion said the squire why not go to a manwhose opinion will be worth having</s> then the vicar explained again</s>  his respect for the bishop was sogreat that any opinion coming from his lordship would to himbe more than advice it would be law</s>  so great was his mingledadmiration of the man and respect for the office</s> what he means said mrs</s>  fenwick is that he wont go to thebishop because he has made up his mind already</s>  you are both ofyou throwing away your time and money in going to salisbury at all</s> im not sure but what shes right there said the vicar</s> nevertheless they went to salisbury</s> the rev</s>  henry fitzackerly chamberlaine was very eloquent clear andargumentative on the subject and perhaps a little overbearing</s>  heinsisted that the chapel should be removed without a moments delayand that notice as to its removal should be served upon all thepersons concernedupon mr</s>  puddleham upon the builder uponthe chapel trustees the elders of the congregationif therebe any elders said mr</s>  chamberlaine with a delightful touchof ironyand upon the marquis and the marquiss agent</s>  he waseloquent authoritative and loud</s>  when the vicar remarked that afterall the chapel had been built for a good purpose mr</s>  chamberlainebecame quite excited in his eloquence</s> the glebe of bullhampton mr</s>  fenwick said he has not beenconfided to your care for the propagation of dissent</s> nor has the vicarage house been confided to me for the reading ofnovels but that is what goes on there</s> the house is for your private comfort said the prebendary</s> and so is the glebe said the vicar and i shall not becomfortable if i make these people put down a house of prayer</s> and there was another argument against the vicars views verystrong</s>  this glebe was only given to him in trust</s>  he was boundso to use it that it should fall into the hands of his successorunimpaired and with full capability for fruition</s>  you have no rightto leave to another the demolition of a building the erection ofwhich you should have prevented</s>  this argument was more difficult ofanswer than the other but mr</s>  fenwick did answer it</s> i feel all that said he and i think it likely that my estate maybe liable for the expense of removal</s>  the chapel may be brought inas a dilapidation</s>  but that which i can answer with my purse neednot lie upon my conscience</s>  i could let the bit of land i have nodoubtthough not on a building lease</s> but they have built on it said mr</s>  chamberlaine</s> no doubt they have and i can see that my estate may be called uponto restore the bit of ground to its former position</s>  what i cant seeis that i am bound to enforce the removal now</s> mr</s>  chamberlaine took up the matter with great spirit and gave acouple of hours to the discussion but the vicar was not shaken</s> the vicar was not shaken but his manner as he went out from theprebendarys presence left some doubt as to his firmness in the mindboth of that dignitary and of the squire</s>  he thanked mr</s>  chamberlainevery courteously and acknowledged that there was a great deal in thearguments which had been used</s> i am sure you will find it best to clear your ground of the nuisanceat once said mr</s>  chamberlaine with that high tone which he knew sowell how to assume and these were the last words spoken</s> well</s>  said the squire as soon as they were out in the closeasking his friend as to his decision</s> its a very knotty point said fenwick</s> i dont much like my uncles tone said the squire i never do</s> but i think he is right</s> i wont say but what he may be</s> itll have to come down frank said the squire</s> no doubt some day</s>  but i am quite sure as to this harry that whenyou have a doubt as to your duty you cant be wrong in delayingthat the doing of which would gratify your own ill will</s>  dont yougo and tell this to the women but to my eyes that conventicle atbullhampton is the most hideous abominable and disagreeable objectthat ever was placed upon the earth</s> so it is to mine said the squire</s> and therefore i wont touch a brick of it</s>  it shall be my hairshirt my fast day my sacrifice of a broken heart my little petgood work</s>  it will enable me to take all the good things of the worldthat come in my way and flatter myself that i am not selfindulgent</s> there is not a dissenter in bullhampton will get so much out of thechapel as i will</s> i fancy they can make you have it pulled down</s> then their making me shall be my hair shirt and i shall be fittedjust as well</s>  upon that they went back to bullhampton and thesquire told the two ladies what had passed as to the hair shirt andall</s> mr</s>  fenwick in making for himself his hair shirt did not think itnecessary to abstain from writing to the marquis of trowbridge</s> this he did on that same day after his return from salisbury</s>  inthe middle of the winter he had written a letter to the marquisremonstrating against the building of the chapel opposite to his owngate</s>  he now took out his copy of that letter and the answer toit in which the agent of the marquis had told him that the marquisconsidered that the spot in question was the most eligible site whichhis lordship could bestow for the purpose in question</s>  our vicar wasvery anxious not to disturb the chapel now that it was built but hewas quite as anxious to disturb the marquis</s>  in the formation of thathair shirt which he was minded to wear he did not intend to weavein any mercy towards the marquis</s>  it behoved him to punish themarquisfor the good of society in general</s>  as a trespasser heforgave the marquis in a christian point of view but as a pestilentwasp on the earth stinging folks right and left with an arrogancethe ignorance of which was the only excuse to be made for hiscruelty he thought it to be his duty to set his heel upon themarquis which he did by writing the following letter</s>  bullhampton vicarage july 18 186</s>  my lord marquis on the 3rd of january last i ventured to write to your lordship with the object of saving myself and my family from a great annoyance and of saving you also from the disgrace of subjecting me to it</s>  i then submitted to you the expediency of giving in the parish some other site for the erection of a dissenting chapel than the small patch of ground immediately opposite to the vicarage gate which as i explained to you i had always regarded as belonging to the vicarage</s>  i did not for a moment question your lordships right to give the land in question but appealed simply to your goodfeeling</s>  i confess that i took it for granted that even your lordship in so very highhanded a proceeding would take care to have right on your side</s>  in answer to this i received a letter from your man of business of which as coming from him i do not complain but which as a reply to my letter to your lordship was an insult</s>  the chapel has been built and on last sunday was opened for worship</s>  i have now learned that the land which you have given away did not belong to your lordship and never formed a portion of the stowte estate in this parish</s>  it was and is glebe land and formed at the time of your bestowal a portion of my freehold as vicar</s>  i acknowledge that i was remiss in presuming that you as a landlord knew the limits of your own rights and that you would not trespass beyond them</s>  i should have made my inquiry more urgently</s>  i have made it now and your lordship may satisfy yourself by referring to the maps of the parish lands which are to be found in the bishops chancery and also at st</s>  johns oxford if you cannot do so by any survey of the estate in your own possession</s>  i enclose a sketch showing the exact limits of the glebe in respect to the vicarage entrance and the patch of ground in question</s>  the fact is that the chapel in question has been built on the glebe land by authorityillegally and unjustly given by your lordship</s>  the chapel is there and though it is a pity that it should have been built it would be a greater pity that it should be pulled down</s>  it is my purpose to offer to the persons concerned a lease of the ground for the term of my incumbency at a nominal rent</s>  i presume that a lease may be so framed as to protect the rights of my successor</s>  i will not conclude this letter without expressing my opinion that gross as has been your lordships ignorance in giving away land which did not belong to you your fault in that respect has been very trifling in comparison with the malice you have shown to a clergyman of your own church settled in a parish partly belonging to yourself in having caused the erection of this chapel on the special spot selected with no other object than that of destroying my personal comfort and that of my wife</s>  i have the honour to be your lordships most obedient servant francis fenwick</s> when he had finished his epistle he read it over more than once andwas satisfied that it would be vexatious to the marquis</s>  it was hisdirect object to vex the marquis and he had set about it with allhis vigour</s>  i would skin him if i knew how he had said to gilmore</s> he has done that to me which no man should forgive</s>  he has spokenill of me and calumniated me not because he has thought ill of mebut because he has had a spite against me</s>  they may keep their chapelas far as i am concerned</s>  but as for his lordship i should think illof myself if i spared him</s>  he had his lordship on the hip and hedid not spare him</s>  he showed the letter to his wife</s> isnt malice a very strong word</s>  she said</s> i hope so answered the vicar</s> what i mean is might you not soften it without hurting your cause</s> i think not</s>  i conscientiously believe the accusation to be true</s> i endeavour so to live among my neighbours that i may not disgracethem or you or myself</s>  this man has dared to accuse me openly ofthe grossest immorality and hypocrisy when i am only doing my dutyas i best know how to do it and i do now believe in my heart that inmaking these charges he did not himself credit them</s>  at any rate noman can be justified in making such charges without evidence</s> but all that had nothing to do with the bit of ground frank</s> it is part and parcel of the same thing</s>  he has chosen to treat meas an enemy and has used all the influence of his wealth and rank toinjure me</s>  now he must look to himself</s>  i will not say a word of himor to him that is untrue but as he has said evil of me behind myback which he did not believe so will i say the evil of him which ido believe to his face</s>  the letter was sent and before the day wasover the vicar had recovered his good humour</s> and before the day was over the news was all through the parish</s> there was a certain ancient shoemaker in the village who had carriedon business in devizes and had now retired to spend the evening ofhis life in his native place</s>  mr</s>  bolt was a quiet inoffensive oldman but he was a dissenter and was one of the elders and trusteeswho had been concerned in raising money for the chapel</s>  to him thevicar had told the whole story declaring at the same time that asfar as he was concerned mr</s>  puddleham and his congregation shouldat any rate for the present be made welcome to their chapel</s>  thishe had done immediately on his return from salisbury and before theletter to the marquis was written</s>  mr</s>  bolt not unnaturally sawhis minister the same evening and the thing was discussed in fullconclave by the puddlehamites</s>  at the end of that discussion mr</s> puddleham expressed his conviction that the story was a mares nestfrom beginning to end</s>  he didnt believe a word of it</s>  the marquiswas not the man to give away anything that did not belong to him</s> somebody had hoaxed the vicar or the vicar had hoaxed mr</s>  bolt orelsewhich mr</s>  puddleham thought to be most likelythe vicarhad gone mad with vexation at the glory and the triumph of the newchapel</s> he was uncommon civil said mr</s>  bolt who at this moment wassomewhat inclined to favour the vicar</s> no doubt mr</s>  bolt no doubt said mr</s>  puddleham who had quiterecovered from his first dismay and had worked himself up to a stateof eloquent enthusiasm</s>  i dare say he was civil</s>  why not</s>  in olddays when we hardly dared to talk of having a decent house of prayerof our own in which to worship our god he was always civil</s>  no onehas ever heard me accuse mr</s>  fenwick of incivility</s>  but will any onetell me that he is a friend to our mode of worship</s>  gentlemen wemust look to ourselves and i for one tell you that that chapel isours</s>  you wont find that his ban will keep me out of my pulpit</s> glebe indeed</s>  why should the vicar have glebe on the other side ofthe road from his house</s>  or for the matter of that why should hehave glebe at all</s>  this was so decisive that no one at the meetinghad a word to say after mr</s>  puddleham had finished his speech</s> when the marquis received his letter he was up in london</s>  lordtrowbridge was not much given to london life but was usuallycompelled by circumstancesthe circumstances being the custom ofsociety as pleaded by his two daughtersto spend the months of mayjune and july at the family mansion in grosvenor square</s>  moreoverthough the marquis never opened his mouth in the house of lords itwas as he thought imperative on him to give to the leader of hisparty the occasional support of his personal presence</s>  our vicarknowing this had addressed his letter to grosvenor square andit had thus reached its destination without loss of time</s>  lordtrowbridge by this time knew the handwriting of his enemy and as hebroke the envelope there came upon him an idea that it might be wiseto refuse the letter and to let it go back to its writer unopened</s> it was beneath his dignity to correspond with a man or to receiveletters from a man who would probably insult him</s>  but before he couldmake up his mind the envelope had been opened and the letter hadbeen read</s>  his wrath when he had read it no writer of a simpleprose narration should attempt to describe</s>  disgrace insultignorance and malicethese were the words with which themarquis found himself pelted by this pestilent abominable and mostimproper clergyman</s>  as to the gist of the letter itself it was sometime before he understood it</s>  and when he did begin to understandit he did not as yet begin to believe it</s>  his intelligence workedslowly whereas his wrath worked quickly</s>  but at last he began to askhimself whether the accusation made against him could possibly bebased on truth</s>  when the question of giving the land had been underconsideration it had never occurred to any one concerned that itcould belong to the glebe</s>  there had been some momentary suspicionthat the spot might possibly have been so long used as common land asto give room for a question on that side but no one had dreamed thatany other claimant could arise</s>  that the whole village of bullhamptonbelonged to the marquis was notorious</s>  of course there was the glebe</s> but who could think that the morsel of neglected land lying on theother side of the road belonged to the vicarage</s>  the marquis did notbelieve it now</s>  this was some piece of wickedness concocted by thevenomous brain of the iniquitous vicar more abominable than all hisother wickednesses</s>  the marquis did not believe it but he walked upand down his room all the morning thinking of it</s>  the marquis wassure that it was not true and yet he could not for a moment get theidea out of his mind</s>  of course he must tell st</s>  george</s>  the languageof the letter which had been sent to him was so wicked that st</s> george must at least agree with him now in his anger against thisman</s>  and could nothing be done to punish the man</s>  prosecutions inregard to anonymous letters threatening letters begging letterspassed through his mind</s>  he knew that punishment had been inflictedon the writers of insolent letters to royalty</s>  and letters had beenproved to be criminal as being libellousonly then they must bepublished and letters were sometimes held to form a conspiracybuthe could not quite see his way to that</s>  he knew that he was notroyal and he knew that the vicar neither threatened him or beggedaught from him</s>  what if st</s>  george should tell him again that thisvicar had right on his side</s>  he cast the matter about in his mind allthe day and then late in the afternoon he got into his carriageand had himself driven to the chambers of messrs</s>  boothby the familylawyers</s> chapter lvii</s> oil is to be thrown upon the waters</s> illustrationmessrs</s>  boothby in lincolns inn had for very many years been thelawyers of the stowte family and probably knew as much aboutthe property as any of the stowtes themselves</s>  they had not beenconsulted about the giving away of the bit of land for the chapelpurposes nor had they been instructed to draw up any deed of gift</s> the whole thing had been done irregularly</s>  the land had been onlypromised and not in truth as yet given and the puddlehamites intheir hurry had gone to work and had built upon a promise</s>  themarquis when after the receipt of mr</s>  fenwicks letter his firstrage was over went at once to the chambers of messrs</s>  boothby andwas forced to explain all the circumstances of the case to the seniorpartner before he could show the clergymans wicked epistle</s>  old mr</s> boothby was a man of the same age as the marquis and in his wayquite as great</s>  only the lawyer was a clever old man whereas themarquis was a stupid old man</s>  mr</s>  boothby sat bowing his head asthe marquis told his story</s>  the story was rather confused and forawhile mr</s>  boothby could only understand that a dissenting chapel hadbeen built upon his clients land</s> we shall have to set it right by some scrap of a conveyance saidthe lawyer</s> but the vicar of the parish claims it said the marquis</s> claims the chapel my lord</s> he is a most pestilent abominable man mr</s>  boothby</s>  i have broughthis letter here</s>  mr</s>  boothby held out his hand to receive theletter</s>  from

can have no idea of such a state of things as this</s>  and now hewrites me this letter</s>  i know his handwriting now and any furthercommunication i shall return</s>  the marquis ceased to speak and thelawyer at once buried himself in the letter</s> it is meant to be offensive said the lawyer</s> most insolent most offensive most improper</s>  and yet the bishopupholds him</s> but if he is right about the bit of land my lord it will be ratherawkward</s>  and as he spoke the lawyer examined the sketch of thevicarage entrance</s>  he gives this as copied from the terrier of theparish my

descended to an iron chamber in thebasement and returned from thence with a certain large tin box</s> into this a search was made and presently mr</s>  boothby came backwith a weighty lump of dusty

chapter lviii</s> edith brownlows dream</s> my dear sit down i want to speak to you</s>  do you know i should liketo see youmarried</s>  this speech was made at dunripple to edithbrownlow by her uncle sir gregory one morning in july as she wasattending him with his breakfast</s>  his breakfast consisted always ofa cup of chocolate made after a peculiar fashion and edith was inthe habit of standing by the old mans bedside while he took it</s>  shewould never sit down because she knew that were she to do so shewould be pretty nearly hidden out of sight in the old armchair thatstood at the bedhead but now she was specially invited to do soand that in a manner which almost made her think that it would bewell that she should hide herself for a space</s>  but she did not sitdown</s>  there was the empty cup to be taken from sir gregorys handsand after the first moment of surprise edith was not quite surethat it would be good that she should hide herself</s>  she took the cupand put it on the table and then returned without making any reply</s> i should like very much to see you married my dear said sirgregory in the mildest of voices</s> do you want to get rid of me uncle</s> no my dear that is just what i dont want</s>  of course youll marrysomebody</s> i dont see any of course uncle gregory</s> but why shouldnt you</s>  i suppose you have thought about it</s> only in a general way uncle gregory</s> sir gregory marrable was not a wise man</s>  his folly was of an ordervery different from that of lord trowbridgevery much less likelyto do harm to himself or others much more innocent and follythough it was a great deal more compatible with certain intellectualgifts</s>  lord trowbridge not to put too fine a point upon it wasa fool all round</s>  he was much too great a fool to have an idea ofhis own folly</s>  now sir gregory distrusted himself in everythingconceived himself to be a poor creature would submit himself to achild on any question of literature and had no opinion of his ownon any matter outside his own propertyand even as to that hisopinion was no more than lukewarm</s>  yet he read a great deal had muchinformation stored away somewhere in his memory and had learned atany rate to know how small a fly he was himself on the wheel of theworld</s>  but alas when he did meddle with anything he was apt tomake a mess of it</s>  there had been some conversation between himand his sisterinlaw ediths mother about walter marrable somealso between him and his son and between him and miss marrablehis cousin</s>
 but as yet no one had spoken to edith and as captainmarrable himself had not spoken it would have been as well perhapsif sir gregory had held his tongue</s>  after ediths last answer the oldman was silent for awhile and then he returned to the subject with adownright questionhow did you like walter when he was here</s> captain marrable</s> yescaptain marrable</s> i liked him well enoughin a way uncle gregory</s> nothing would please me so much edith as that you should becomehis wife</s>  you know that dunripple will belong to him some day</s> if gregory does not marry</s>  edith had hardly known whether to saythis or to leave it unsaid</s>  she was well aware that her cousingregory would never marrythat he was a confirmed invalid a manalready worn out old before his time and with one foot in thegrave</s>  but had she not said it she would have seemed to herself tohave put him aside as a person altogether out of the way</s> gregory will never marry</s>  of course while he lives dunripple will behis but if walter were to marry he would make arrangements</s>  i daresay you cant understand all about that my dear but it would be avery good thing</s>  i should be so happy if i thought that you were tolive at dunripple always</s> edith kissed him and escaped without giving any other answer</s>  tendays after that walter marrable was to be again at dunrippleonlyfor a few days

been blown away</s>  so much edith had heard</s>  to herself waltermarrable had been very friendly and in truth she had liked himmuch</s>  they two were not cousins but they were so connected and hadfor some weeks been so thrown together as to be almost as good ascousins</s>  his presence at dunripple had been very pleasant to her butshe had never thought of him as a lover</s>  and she had an idea of herown that girls ought not to think of men as lovers without a gooddeal of provocation</s> sir gregory spoke to mrs</s>  brownlow on the same subject and as hetold her what had taken place between him and edith she felt herselfcompelled to speak to her daughter</s> if it should take place my dear it would be very well but i wouldrather your uncle had not mentioned it</s> it wont do any

might be something</s>  but i will say nothing more about it</s>  youveso much good sense that i am quite sure you wont get into trouble</s>  iwish sir gregory had not spoken to you but as he has it may be aswell that you should know that the family arrangement would be veryagreeable to your uncle and to cousin gregory</s>  the title and theproperty must go to captain marrable at last and sir gregory wouldmake immediate sacrifices for you which perhaps he would not makefor him</s> edith understood all about it very clearly and would have understoodall about it with half the words</s>  she would have little or no fortuneof her own and in money her uncle would have very little to give toher</s>  indeed there was no reason why he should give her anything</s>  shewas not connected with any of the marrables by blood though chancehad caused her to live at dunripple almost all her life</s>  she hadbecome half a marrable already and it might be very well that sheshould become a marrable altogether</s>  walter was a remarkably handsomeman would be a baronet and would have an estate and mightperhaps have the enjoyment of the estate by marrying her earlierthan he would were he to marry any one else</s>  edith brownlowunderstood it all with sufficient clearness</s>  but then she understoodalso that young women shouldnt give away their hearts before theyare asked for them and she was

the doctorinformation on which he could rely he learned that mr</s>  marrable wasin real danger but that sir gregorys ailment was no more than hisusual infirmity heightened by anxiety on behalf of his son</s>  youruncle may live for the next ten years said the doctor but i donot know what to say about mr</s>  marrable</s>  all this time the careand time of the two ladies were divided between the invalids</s> mrs</s>  brownlow tended her nephew and edith as usual waitedupon sir gregory</s>  in such circumstances it was not extraordinarythat edith brownlow and walter marrable should be thrown muchtogetherespecially as it was the desire of all concerned with themthat they should become man and wife</s>  poor edith was subject to afeeling that everybody knew that she was expected to fall in lovewith the man</s>  she thought it probable too that the man himself hadbeen instructed to fall in love with her</s>  this no doubt created agreat difficulty for her a difficulty which she felt to be heavy andinconvenientbut it was lessened by the present condition of thehousehold</s>  when there is illness in a house the feminine genius andspirit predominates the male</s>  if the illness be so severe as to causea sense of danger this is so strongly the case that the naturalposition of the two is changed</s>  edith quite unconscious of thereason was much less afraid of her proposed lover than she wouldhave been had there been no going about on tiptoe no questions askedwith bated breath no great need for womanly aid</s> walter had been there four days and was sitting with edith oneevening out on the lawn among the rhododendrons</s>  when he had foundwhat was the condition of the household he had offered to go back atonce to his regiment at birmingham</s>  but sir gregory would not hear ofit</s>  sir gregory hated the regiment and had got an idea in his headthat his nephew ought not to be there at all</s>  he was too weak anddiffident to do it himself but if any one would have arranged it forhim he would have been glad to fix an income for walter marrableon condition that walter should live at home and look after theproperty and be unto him as a son</s>  but

 she was not quite sure</s>  he was very nicebut she wasnot quite sure</s>  one ought to be very fond of a young man she saidto herself before one falls in love with him</s>  nevertheless her mindwas

assented cordially and had called him walterwithout a moments hesitation</s>  edith he said to her now after hehad sat for a minute or two with the coffee in his hand did youever hear of a certain

love you so much that iwonder whether i may tell you the great secret of my life</s> of course you may</s>  i love secrets and i specially love the secretsof those who love me</s>  she said this with a voice perfectly clearand a face without a sign of disappointment but her little dream hadalready been dissipated</s>  she knew the secret as well as though it hadbeen told</s> i was engaged to marry her</s> and you will marry her</s> it was broken offwhen i thought that i should be forced to go toindia</s>  the story is very long and very sad</s>  it is my own father whohas ruined me</s>  but i will tell it you some day</s>  then he told it allas he was sitting there with his cigar in his hand</s>  stories may seemto be very long and yet be told very quickly</s> but you will go back to her now</s>  said edith</s> she has not waited for me</s> what do you mean</s> they tell me that she is to be married to ato acertain mr</s> gilmore</s> already</s> he had offered to her twenty times

givenanything to have called him then by his christian name</s> my uncle john</s> i would ask herself</s> i mean to do so</s>  but somehow treated as i am here i am bound totell my uncle of it first</s>  and i cannot do that while gregory is soill</s> i must go up to my uncle now walter</s>  and i do so hope she may betrue to you</s>  and i do so hope i may like her</s>  dont believe

was not necessary thatshe should tell her mother as yet</s> chapter lix</s> news from dunripple</s> at the end of the first week in august news reached the vicarage atbullhampton that was not indeed very important to the family of mr</s> fenwick but which still seemed to have an immediate effect on theirlives and comfort</s>  the vicar for some days past had been as regardedhimself in a high good humour in consequence of a communicationwhich he had received from lord st</s>  george</s>  further mention of thiscommunication must be made but it may be deferred to the nextchapter as other matters more momentous require our immediateattention</s>  mr</s>  gilmore had pleaded very hard that a day might befixed and had almost succeeded</s>  mary lowther driven into a cornerhad been able to give no reason why she should not fix a day otherthan thisthat mr</s>  gilmore had promised her that she should not behurried</s>  what do you mean</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick had said angrily</s>  youspeak of the man who is to be your husband as though your greatesthappiness in life were to keep away from him</s>  mary lowther had notdared to answer that such would be her greatest happiness</s>  then newshad reached the vicarage of the illness of gregory marrable and ofwalter marrables presence at dunripple</s>  this had come of course fromaunt sarah at loring but it had come in such a manner as to seem tojustify for a time marys silence in reference to that question ofnaming the day</s>  the marrables of dunripple were not nearly relatedto her</s>  she had no personal remembrance of either sir gregory or hisson</s>  but there was an importance attached to the tidings which ifanalysed would have been found to attach itself to captain marrablerather than to the two men who were ill and this was tacitly allowedto have an influence</s>  aunt sarah had expressed her belief thatgregory marrable was dying and had gone on to saytrusting to theknown fact that mary had engaged herself to mr</s>  gilmore and to thefact as believed to be a fact that walter was engaged to edithbrownlowhad gone on to say that captain marrable would probablyremain at dunripple and would take immediate charge of the estate</s> i think there is no doubt said aunt sarah that captain marrableand edith brownlow will be married</s>  mary was engaged to mr</s>  gilmoreand why should not aunt sarah tell her news</s> the squire who had become elated and happy at the period of therubies had in three days again fallen away into a state of angrygloom rather than of melancholy</s>  he said very little just now eitherto fenwick or to mrs</s>  fenwick about his marriage and indeed he didnot say very much to mary herself</s>  men were already at work aboutthe gardens at the privets and he would report to her what was doneand would tell her that the masons and painters would begin in a fewdays</s>  now and again he would ask for her company up to the place andshe had been there twice at his instance since the day on which shehad gone after him of her own accord and had fetched him down tolook at the jewels</s>  but there was little or no sympathy between them</s> mary could not bring herself to care about the house or the gardensthough she told herself again and again that there was she to livefor the remainder of her life</s> two letters she received from her aunt at loring within an intervalof three days and these letters were both filled with details as tothe illness of sir gregory and his son at dunripple</s>  walter marrablesent accounts to his uncle the parson and mrs</s>  brownlow sentaccounts to miss marrable herself</s>  and then on the day following thereceipt of the last of these two letters there came one from waltermarrable himself addressed to mary lowther</s>  gregory marrable wasdead and the letter announcing the death of the baronets only sonwas as follows dunripple august 12 1868</s>  my dear mary i hardly know whether you will have expected that the news which i have to tell you should reach you direct from me but i think upon the whole that it is better that i should write</s>  my cousin gregory marrable sir gregorys only son died this morning</s>  i do not doubt but that you know that he has been long ill</s>  he has come to the end of all his troubles and the old baronet is now childless</s>  he also has been and is still unwell though i do not know that he is much worse than usual</s>
 of course he feels his sons death acutely for he is a father who has ever been good to his son</s>  but it always seems to me that old people become so used to death that they do not think of it as do we who are younger</s>  i have seen him twice today since the news was told to him and though he spoke of his son with infinite sorrow he was able to talk of other things</s>  i write to you myself especially instead of getting one of the ladies here to do so because i think it proper to tell you how things stand with myself</s>  everything is changed with me since you and i parted because it was necessary that i should seek my fortune in india</s>  you already know that i have abandoned that idea and i now find that i shall leave the army altogether</s>  my uncle has wished it since i first came here and he now proposes that i shall live here permanently</s>  of course the meaning is that i should assume the position of his heir</s>  my father with whom i personally will have no dealing in the matter stands between us</s>  but i do suppose that the family affairs will be so arranged that i may feel secure that i shall not be turned altogether adrift upon the world</s>  dear maryi do not know how to tell you that as regards my future everything now depends on you</s>  they have told me that you have accepted an offer from mr</s>  gilmore</s>  i know no more than thisthat they have told me so</s>  if you will tell me also that you mean to be his wife i will say no more</s>  but until you tell me so i will not believe it</s>  i do not think that you can ever love him as you certainly once loved meand when i think of it how short a time ago that was</s>  i know that i have no right to complain</s>  our separation was my doing as much as yours</s>  but i will settle nothing as to my future life till i hear from yourself whether or no you will come back to me</s>  i shall remain here till after the funeral which will take place on friday</s>  on monday i shall go back to birmingham</s>  this is sunday and i shall expect to hear from you before the week is over</s>  if you bid me i will be with you early next week</s>  if you tell me that my coming will be uselesswhy then i shall care very little what happens</s>  yours with all the love of my heart walter marrable</s> luckily for mary she was alone when she read the letter</s>  her firstidea on reading it was to think of the words which she had usedwhen she had most ungraciously consented to become the wife ofharry gilmore</s>  were he so placed that he could afford to marry apoor wife i should leave you and go to him</s>  she remembered themaccurately</s>  she had made up her mind at the time that she would saythem thinking that thus he would be driven from her and that shewould be at rest from his solicitation from those of her friendsand from the qualms of her own conscience</s>  he had chosen to claimher in spite of those wordsand now the thing had happened tothe possibility of which she had referred</s>  poor as she was waltermarrable was able to make her his wife</s>  she held in her hand hisletter telling her that it was so</s>  all her heart was hisas muchnow as it had ever been and it was impossible that she should not goto him</s>  she had told mr</s>  gilmore herself that she could never loveagain as she loved walter marrable</s>  she had been driven to believethat she could never be his wife and she had separated herself fromhim</s>  she had separated herself from him and persuaded herself thatit would be expedient for her to become the wife of this other man</s> but up to this very moment she had never been able to overcome herhorror at the prospect</s>  from day to day she had thought that she mustgive it up even when they were dinning into her ears the tidingsthat walter marrable was to marry that girl at dunripple</s>  but thathad been a falsehoodan absolute falsehood</s>  there had been no suchthought in his bosom</s>  he had never been untrue to her</s>  ah</s>  how muchthe nobler of the two had he been</s> and yet she had struggled hard to do rightto think of others morethan of herselfso to dispose of herself that she might be of someuse

thatmarriage but now the attempt was impossible</s>  what right could shehave to refuse the man she loved when he told her that all hishappiness depended on her love</s>  she could see it now</s>  with all herdesire to do right she had done foul wrong in accepting mr</s>  gilmore</s> she had done foul wrong though she had complied with the advice ofall her friends</s>  it could not but have

injury was done and could not now beundone</s>  and had she not told him when he came to her that she wouldeven yet return to walter marrable if walter marrable were able totake her</s> she went down

mrs</s>  fenwick was fartoo clever not to see that the serious solemn aspect of marys facewas not due altogether to the death of a distant cousin whom sheherself did not even rememberbut she was too wise also to referto what she presumed to be marys special grief at the moment</s>  marywas doubtless thinking of the altered circumstances of her cousinwalter but it was as well now that she should speak as little aspossible about that cousin</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick could not turn altogether toanother subject but she would if possible divert her friend fromher present thoughts</s>  shall you go

advise as though she could make up byobedience for the want of that affection which she owed to him</s>  nowwhen she was told that she ought to consult mr</s>  gilmore she flatlyrefused to do so</s> mary came up the garden a few minutes afterwards and as she passedtowards the house she begged to be excused from going into lunchthat day</s>  lord st</s>  george was coming up to lunch at the vicarage aswill be explained in the next chapter</s> chapter lx</s> lord st</s>  george is very cunning</s> lord st</s>  george began to throw his oil upon the waters in referenceto that unfortunate

very oily</s>  but his son would not bate him an inch of hissurrender</s> he is so utterly worthless the marquis had said pleading hard ashe spoke of his enemy</s> im not quite sure my lord that you understand the man st</s> george had said</s>  you hate him and no doubt he hates you</s> horribly</s>  ejaculated the marquis</s> you intend to be as good as you know how to be to all those peopleat bullhampton</s> indeed i do st</s>  george said the marquis almost with tears in hiseyes</s> and i shouldnt wonder if he did too</s> but look at his life said the marquis</s> it isnt always easy to look at a mans life</s>  we are always lookingat mens lives and always making mistakes</s>  the bishop thinks heis a good sort of fellow and the bishop isnt the man to like adebauched unbelieving

will meet me i will drive over to bullhampton on monday the 13th</s>  yours truly st</s>  george</s>  no doubt youll agree with me in thinking that internecine fighting in a parish between the

mr</s>  fenwick as aweakness or a strength that though he was very susceptible of angerand though he could maintain his anger at glowing heat as long asfighting continued it would all evaporate and leave him harmlessas a dove at the first glimpse of an olivebranch</s>  he knew this sowell of himself that it would sometimes be a regret to him in theculmination of his wrath that he would not be

let us go and see the corpus delicti said the vicar as soon asthey had drawn their chairs from the table</s> the two men went out and walked round the chapel and finding itopen walked into it</s>  of course there were remarks made by both ofthem</s>  it was acknowledged that it was ugly misplaced uncomfortabledetestable to the eye and ear and general feelingexcept in sofar as it might suit the wants of people who were not sufficientlyeducated to enjoy the higher tone and more elaborate language ofthe church of england services</s>  it was thus that they spoke to eachother quite in an sthetic manner</s> lord st</s>  george had said as he entered the chapel that it must comedown as a matter of course and the vicar had suggested that thereneed be no hurry</s> they tell me that it must be removed some day said the vicar butas i am not likely to leave the parish nobody need start the matterfor a year or two</s>  lord st</s>  george was declaring that advantagecould not be taken

his troubles</s> when the vicar went on his unhappy mission to the squires housecarry brattle had been nearly two months at the mill</s>  during thattime both mr</s>  and mrs</s>  fenwick had seen her more than once and atlast she had been persuaded to go to church with her sister</s>  on theprevious sunday she had crept through the village at fannys sideand had taken a place provided for her in the dark corner of a darkpew under the protection of a thick veil</s>  fanny walked with herboldly across the village street as though she were not in anyslightest degree ashamed of her companion and sat by her side andthen conveyed her home</s>  on the next sunday the sacrament would begiven and this was done in preparation for that day</s> things had not gone very pleasantly at the mill</s>  up to this momentold brattle had expressed no forgiveness towards his daughter haduttered no word of affection to her had made no sign that he hadagain taken her to his bosom as his own child</s>  he had spoken to herbecause in the narrow confines of their home it was almost impossiblethat he should live in the house with her without doing so</s>  carry hadgradually fallen into the way of doing her share of the daily work</s> she cooked and baked and strove hard that her presence in the houseshould be found to be a comfort</s>  she was useful and the very fact ofher utility brought her father into a certain state of communion withher but he never addressed her specially never called her by hername and had not yet even acknowledged to his wife or to fanny thathe recognised her as one of the family</s>  they had chosen to bring herin against his will and he would not turn their guest from the door</s> it was thus that he seemed to regard his daughters presence in themillhouse</s> under this treatment carry was becoming restive and impatient</s>  onsuch an occasion as that of going to church and exposing herself tothe eyes of those who had known her as an innocent laughing saucygirl she could not but be humble quiet and awestruck but at homeshe was beginning again gradually to assert her own character</s>  iffather wont speak to me id better go she said to fanny</s> and where will you go to carry</s> i dun knowinto the millpond would be best for them as belongsto me</s>  i suppose there aint anybody as d have me</s> nobody can have you as will love you as we do carry</s> why wont father come round and speak to me</s>  you cant tell whatit is to have him looking at one that way</s>  i sometimes feels likegetting up and telling him to turn me out if he wont speak a word tome</s>  but fanny had softened her and encouraged her bidding her waitstill again explaining the sorrow that weighed upon their fathersheart as well as she could without saying a single cruel word as tocarrys past life</s>  fannys task was not easy and it was made theharder by their mothers special tenderness towards carry</s>  the lessshe says and the more she does the better for her said fanny toher mother</s>  you shouldnt let her talk about father</s>  mrs</s>  brattledid not attempt to argue the matter with her elder daughter but shefound it to be quite out of her power to restrain carrys talking</s> during these two months old brattle had not even seen either hislandlord or the vicar</s>  they had both been at the mill but themiller had kept himself up among his grist and had not condescendedto come down to them</s>  nor had he even since carrys return beenseen in bullhampton or even up on the high road leading to it</s>  heheld no communion with men other than was absolutely necessary forhis business feeling himself to be degraded not so much by hisdaughters fall as by his concession to his fallen daughter</s>  he wouldsit out in the porch of an evening and smoke his pipe but if heheard a footstep on the lane he would retreat and cross the plankand get among the wheels of his mill or out into the orchard</s>  ofsam nothing had been heard</s>  he was away it was believed in durhamworking at some colliery engine</s>  he gave no sign of himself to hismother or sister but it was understood that he would appear atthe assizes towards the end of the present month as he had beensummoned there as a witness at the trial of the two men for themurder of mr</s>  trumbull</s> and carry also was to be a witness at the assizes and as it wasbelieved a witness much more material than her brother</s>  indeed itwas beginning to be thought that after all sam would have no evidenceto give</s>  if indeed he had had nothing to do with the murder it wasnot probable that any of the circumstances of the murder would havebeen confided to him</s>  he had it seemed been on intimate terms withthe man acornand through acorn had known burrows and the oldwoman who lived at pycroft common the mother of burrows</s>  he had beenin their company when they first visited bullhampton and had as weknow invited them into the vicars gardenmuch to the damage ofmr</s>  burrows shoulderblade but it was believed that beyond this hecould say nothing as to the murder</s>  but carry brattle was presumedto have a closer knowledge of at least one of the men</s>  she had nowconfessed to her sister that after leaving bullhampton she hadconsented to become acorns wife</s>  she had known then but little ofhis mode of life or past history but he was young goodlookingfairly welldressed and had promised to marry her</s>  by him she wastaken to the cottage on pycroft common and by him she had certainlybeen visited on the morning after the murder</s>  he had visited her andgiven her moneyand since that according to her own story she hadneither seen him nor heard from him</s>  she had never cared for himshe told her sister but what was that to one such as her as long ashe would make her an honest woman</s>  all this was repeated by fannybrattle to mrs</s>  fenwickand now the assizes were at hand and howwas carry to demean herself there</s>  who would take her</s>  who wouldstand near her and support her and save her from falling into thatabyss of selfabasement and almost of selfannihilation which wouldbe her doom unless there were some one there to give her strengthand aid</s> i would not go to salisbury at all during the assizes if i wereyou mrs</s>  fenwick had said to her husband</s>  the vicar understoodthoroughly what was meant</s>  because of the evil things which hadbeen said of him by that stupid old marquis whom he had beencheated into forgiving he was not to be allowed to give a helpinghand to his parishioner</s>  nevertheless he acknowledged his wifeswisdomtacitly as is fitting when such acknowledgments have to bemade and he contented himself with endeavouring to find for her someother escort</s>  it had been hoped from day to day that the miller wouldyield that he would embrace poor carry and promise her that sheshould again be to him as a daughter</s>  if this could be brought aboutthenso thought the vicar and fanny toothe old man would steelhimself to bear the eyes of the whole county and would accompany thegirl himself</s>  but now the day was coming on and brattle seemed to beas far from yielding as ever</s>  fanny had dropped a word or two in hishearing about the assizes but he had only glowered at her taking noother notice whatever of her hints</s> when the vicar left his friend gilmore as has been told in the lastchapter he did not return to the vicarage across the fields buttook the carriage road down to the lodge and from thence crossed thestile that led into the path down to the mill</s>  this was on the 15thof august a wednesday and carry was summoned to be at salisbury onthat day week</s>  as the day drew near she became very nervous</s>  at thevicars instance fanny had written to her brother george asking himwhether he would be good to his poor sister and take her under hischarge</s>  he had written backor rather his wife had written forhimsending carry a note for 20 as a present but declining onthe score of his own children to be seen with her in salisbury onthe occasion</s>  i shall go with her myself mr</s>  fenwick fanny hadsaid to the vicar itll just be better than nobody at all to bealong with her</s>  the vicar was now going down to the mill to give hisassent to this</s>  he could see nothing better</s>  fanny at any rate wouldbe firm would not be prevented by false shame from being a verysister to her sister and would perhaps be admitted where a brothersattendance might be refused</s>  he had promised to see the women at themill as early in the week as he could and now he went thither intenton giving them advice as to their proceedings at salisbury</s>  it woulddoubtless be necessary that they should sleep there and he hopedthat they might be accommodated by mrs</s>  stiggs</s> as he stepped out from the field path on to the lane almostimmediately in front of the mill he came directly upon the miller</s> it was between twelve and one oclock and old brattle was wanderingabout for a minute or two waiting for his dinner</s>  the two men metso that it was impossible that they should not speak and on thisoccasion the miller did not seem to avoid his visitor</s>  musterfenwick said he as he took the vicars hand i am bound to sayas im much obliged to ye for all y have done for that poor lass inthere</s> dont say a word about that mr</s>  brattle</s> but i must say a word</s>  theres money owing as i knows</s>  there was tenshilling a week for her keep all that time she was at salsbryyonder</s> i will not hear a word as to any money</s> her brother george has sent her a gift muster fenwicktwentypound</s> i am very glad to hear it</s> george is a welltodo man they tell me continued the fatherand can afford to part with his money</s>  but he wont come forward tohelp the girl any other gait</s>  ill thank you just to take whats duemuster fenwick and you can give her sister the change</s>  our fanny hasgot the note as george sent</s> then there was a dispute about the money as a matter of course</s> fenwick swore that nothing was due and the miller protested that asthe money was there all his daughters expenses at salisbury shouldbe repaid</s>  and the miller at last got the best of it</s>  fenwickpromised that he would look to his book see how much he had paidand mention the sum to fanny at some future time</s>  he positivelyrefused to take the note at present protesting that he had nochange and that he would not burden himself with the responsibilityof carrying so much money about with him in his pocket</s>  then he askedwhether if he went into the house he would be able to say a word ortwo to the women before dinner</s>  he had made up his mind that he wouldmake no further attempt at reconciling the father to his daughter</s>  hehad often declared to his wife that there could be nothing so hatefulto a man as the constant interference of a selfconstituted adviser</s> i so often feel that i am making myself odious when i am tellingthem to do this or that and then i ask myself what i should sayif anybody were to come and advise me how to manage you and thebairns</s>  and he had told his wife more than once how very natural andreasonable had been the expression of the ladys wrath at startupwhen he had taken upon himself to give her advice</s>  people know whatis good for them to do well enough without being dictated to by aclergyman</s>  he had repeated the words to himself and to his wife adozen times and talked of having them put up in big red letters overthe fireplace in his own study</s>  he had therefore quite determined tosay never another word to old brattle in reference to his daughtercarry</s>  but now the miller himself began upon the subject</s> you can see em muster fenwick in course</s>  it dont make no oddsabout dinner</s>  but i was wanting just to say a word to you about thatpoor young ooman there</s>  this he said in a slow halfhesitatingvoice as though he could hardly bring himself to speak of theunfortunate one to whom he alluded</s>  the vicar muttered some word ofassent and then the miller went on</s>  you knows of course as howshe be back here at the mill</s> certainly i do</s>  ive seen her more than once</s> muster fenwick i dont suppose as any one as asnt tried it knowswhat it is</s>  i hopes you maynt never know it nor it aint likely</s> muster fenwick id sooner see her dead body stretched afore meandi loved her amost as well as any father ever loved his dateridsooner a seed her brought home to the door stiff and stark than knowher to be the thing she is</s>  his hesitation had now given way toemphasis and he raised his hand as he spoke</s>  the vicar caught it andheld it in his own and strove to find some word to say as the oldman paused in his speech</s>  but to jacob brattle it was hard for aclergyman to find any word to say on such an occasion</s>  of what usecould it be to preach of repentance to one who believed nothing orto tell of the opportunity which forgiveness by an earthly parentmight afford to the sinner of obtaining lasting forgivenesselsewhere</s>  but let him have said what he might the miller would nothave listened</s>  he was full of that which lay upon his own heart</s>  ifthey only knowd what them as cares for em d has to bear maybetheyd think a little</s>  but it aint natural they should know musterfenwick and ones amost tempted to say that a man d better have nochild at all</s> think of your son george mr</s>  brattle and of mrs</s>  jay</s> whats them

of her always musterfenwickday and night</s>  when the mills agoing its all the same</s> its just as though there warnt nothing else in the whole world as iminded to think on</s>  ive been a man all my life muster fenwick andnow i aint a man no more</s> illustration its in here muster fenwickin here</s> our friend the vicar never before felt himself so utterly unable toadminister comfort in affliction</s>  there was nothing on which he couldtake hold</s>  he could tell the man no doubt that beyond all thisthere might be everlasting joy not only for him but for him and thegirl togetherjoy which would be sullied by no touch of disgrace</s> but there was a stubborn strength in the infidelity of this old paganwhich was utterly impervious to any adjuration on that side</s>  thatwhich he saw and knew and felt he would believe but he wouldbelieve nothing else</s>  he knew now that he was wounded and sore andwretched and he understood the cause</s>  he knew that he must bear hismisery to the last and he struggled to make his back broad for theload</s>  but even the desire for ease which is natural to all menwould not make him flinch in his infidelity</s>  as he would not believewhen things went well with him and when the comfort of hope for thefuture was not imperatively needed for his daily solaceso would henot believe now when his need for such comfort was so pressing</s> the upshot of it all was that the miller thought that he would takehis own daughter into salisbury and was desirous of breaking thematter in this way to the friend of his family</s>  the vicar of courseapplauded him much</s>  indeed he applauded too muchfor the millerturned on him and declared that he was by no means certain that hewas doing right</s>  and when the vicar asked him to be gentle with thegirl he turned upon him again</s> why aint she been gentle along of me</s>  i hates such gentilitymuster fenwick</s>  ill be honest with her any way</s>  but he thoughtbetter of it before he let the vicar go</s>  i shant do her no hurtmuster fenwick</s>  bad as shes been shes my own flesh and bloodstill</s> after what he had heard mr</s>  fenwick declined going into themillhouse and returned home without seeing mrs</s>  brattle and herdaughters</s>  the millers determination should be told by himself andthe vicar felt that he could hardly keep the secret were he now tosee the women</s> chapter lxiv</s> if i were your sister</s> mr</s>  gilmore in his last words to his friend fenwick declared that hewould not accept the message which the vicar delivered to him as thesufficient expression of marys decision</s>  he would see mary lowtherherself and force her to confess her own treachery face to face withhimto confess it or else to deny it</s>  so much she could not refuseto grant him</s>  fenwick had indeed said that as long as the young ladywas his guest she must be allowed to please herself as to whom shewould see or not see</s>  gilmore should not be encouraged to forcehimself upon her at the vicarage</s>  but the squire was quite sure thatso much as that must be granted to him</s>  it was impossible that evenmary lowther should refuse to see him after what had passed betweenthem</s>  and then as he walked about his own fields thinking ofit all he allowed himself to feel a certain amount of hope thatafter all she might be made to marry him</s>  his love for her had notdwindledor rather his desire to call her his own and to makeher his wife but it had taken an altered form out of which all itsnative tenderness had been pressed by the usage to which he had beensubjected</s>  it was his honour rather than his love that he now desiredto satisfy</s>  all those who knew him best were aware that he had sethis heart upon this marriage and it was necessary to him that heshould show them that he was not to be disappointed</s>  marys conductto him from the day on which she had first engaged herself to him hadbeen of such a kind as naturally to mar his tenderness and to banishfrom him all those prettinesses of courtship in which he would haveindulged as pleasantly as any other man</s>  she had told him in so manywords that she intended to marry him without loving him and on theseterms he had accepted her</s>  but in doing so he had unconsciouslyflattered himself that she would be better than her wordsthatas she submitted herself to him as his affianced bride she wouldgradually become soft and loving in his hands</s>  she had if possiblebeen harder to him even than her words</s>  she had made him understandthoroughly that his presence was not a joy to her and that herengagement to him was a burden on her which she had taken on hershoulders simply because the romance of her life had been nippedin the bud in reference to the man whom she did love</s>  still he hadpersevered</s>  he had set his heart sturdily on marrying this girland marry her he would if after any fashion such marriage shouldcome within his power</s>  mrs</s>  fenwick by whose judgment and affectionhe had been swayed through all this matter had told him again andagain that such a girl as mary lowther must love her husbandifher husband loved her and treated her with tenderness</s>  i think ican answer for myself gilmore had once replied and his friendhad thoroughly believed in him</s>  trusting to the assurance he hadpersevered he had persevered even when his trust in that assurancehad been weakened by the girls hardness</s>  anything would be betterthan breaking from an engagement on which he had so long rested allhis hopes of happiness</s>  she was pledged to be his wife and thatbeing so he could reform his gardens and decorate his house andemploy himself about his place with some amount of satisfaction</s>  hehad at least a purpose in his life</s>  then by degrees there grew uponhim a fear that she still meant to escape from him and he sworeto himselfwithout any tendernessthat this should not beso</s>  let her once be his wife and she should be treated with allconsiderationwith all affection if she would accept it but sheshould not make a fool of him now</s>  then the vicar had come with hismessage and he had been simply told that the engagement between themwas over</s> of course he would see herand that at once</s>  as soon as fenwick hadleft him he went with rapid steps over his whole place and set themen again upon their work</s>  this took place on a wednesday and themen should be continued at their work at any rate till saturday</s>  heexplained this clearly to ambrose his gardener and to the foremanin the house</s> it may be said he to ambrose that i shall change my mindaltogether about the placebut as i am still in doubt leteverything go on till saturday</s> of course they all knew why it was that the conduct of the squire wasso like the conduct of a madman</s> he sent down a note to mary lowther that evening</s>  dear mary i have seen fenwick and of course i must see you</s>  will you name an hour

mrs</s>  fenwick was with her friend up to the moment at which the bellwas heard at the front door</s>  there was no coming up across the lawnnow</s> dear janet mary said when they were alone how i wish that i hadnever come to trouble you here at the vicarage</s> mrs</s>  fenwick was not without a feeling that much of all thisunhappiness had come from her own persistency on behalf of herhusbands

as she looked into hisface but he spoke no word as he passed on to the room which she hadjust left</s>  mary was standing in the middle of the floor halfwaybetween the window and the door to receive him</s>  when she heardthe doorbell she put her hand to her heart and there she held ittill he was approaching but then she dropped it and stood withoutsupport with her face upraised to meet him</s>  he came up to her veryquickly and took her by the hand</s>  mary he said i am not tobelieve this message that has been sent to me</s>  i do not believeit</s>  i will not believe it</s>  i will not

she did not quail before his eyes</s>  nevertheless she would havegiven the world to have been elsewhere and to have been free fromthe necessity of answering him</s>  she had been fortifying herselfthroughout the morning with selfexpressed protests that on noaccount would she yield whether she had been right before orwrongof this she was convinced that she must be right now to saveherself

know how to do now</s> why is it to be done now</s>  what is it that has changed you</s> she withdrew her hand from him and waited a while before sheanswered</s>  it was necessary that she should tell him all the tidingsthat had been conveyed to her in the letter which she had receivedfrom her cousin walter but in order that he should perfectlyunderstand them and be made to know their force upon herself she mustremind him of the stipulation which she had made when she consentedto her engagement</s>  but how could she speak words which would seemto him to be spoken only to remind him of the abjectness of hissubmission to her</s> i was brokenhearted when i came here she said</s> and therefore you would leave me brokenhearted now</s> you should spare me mr</s>  gilmore</s>  you remember

time had now come in which she must indeed speak up</s>  and speechseemed to be easier with her now that he had allowed himself toexpress his anger</s>  he had expressed more than his anger</s>  he had daredto shower his scorn upon her and the pelting of the storm gave hercourage</s>  you are unjust upon me mr</s>  gilmoreunjust and cruel</s>  youknow in your heart that i have not changed</s> were you not betrothed to me</s> i wasbut in what way</s>  have i told you any untruth</s>  have iconcealed anything</s>  when i accepted you did i not explain toyou how and why it was soagainst my

be justified from a gentleman to a lady</s>  and certainly hehad not intended to insult her as he was coming down to the vicarage</s> as far as any settled purpose had been formed in his mind he hadmeant to force her back to her engagement with himself by showing toher how manifest would be her injustice and how great her treacheryif she persisted in leaving him</s>  but he knew her character wellenough to be aware that any word of insult addressed to her as awoman would create offence which she herself would be unable toquell</s>  but his anger had got the better of his judgment and whenthe suggestion was made to him of a sister of his own he took theopportunity which was offered to him of hitting her with all hisforce</s>  she had felt the blow and had determined that she would neverencounter another</s> he was left alone and he must retreat</s>  he waited a while thinkingthat perhaps mrs</s>  fenwick or the vicar would come to him but nobodycame</s>  the window of the room

offer for the girls handas it were with his last gasp</s>  but as he went he told himself thatit was impossible that it should be accepted</s>  every chance had nowgone from him and he must look his condition in the face as besthe could</s>  it had been bad enough with him before when no hope hadever been held out to him when the answers of the girl he loved hadalways been adverse to him when no

derangement of the outer tranquillity ofhis life</s>  even then he had been unable so to live that men should notknow that his sorrow had disturbed him</s>  when he had gone to loringtravelling with a forlorn hope into the neighbourhood of the girlhe loved he had himself been aware that he had lacked strength tocontrol himself in his misfortune</s>  but if his state then had beengrievous what must

afford to let prudence go by theboard</s>  true that his pleasure in doing this had been sorely marred byher coldness by her indifference even by her selfabnegation buthe had continued to buoy himself up with the idea that all would comeright when she should be his wife</s>  now she had told him that shewould never willingly speak to him againand he believed her</s> he went up to his house and into his bedroom and then he satthinking of it all</s>  and as he thought he heard the voices and thetools of the men at their work and knew that things were beingdone which for him would never be of

cornicescompleted and the woodwork painted</s>  but as for the furniturehangings and such like they should be left till further ordersshould be received from the owner</s>  as for the mud and muck in

writewithout a feeling of shame</s>  and then how could she be happy whenshe had caused so much misery</s>  and how could she write her letterwithout expressing her happiness</s>  she wished that her own identitymight be divided so that she might rejoice over walters love withthe one moiety and grieve with the other at all the trouble she hadbrought upon the man whose love to her had been so

then she read it again</s>  if you bid me i will be with you early nextweek</s>  what if she told him nothing but only bade him come to her</s> after all would it not be best to write no more than

was required in salisbury for the trialof john burrows and lawrence acorn on wednesday the 22nd of august</s> our vicar who had learned that the judges would come into the cityonly late on the previous evening and that the day following theirentrance would doubtless be so fully occupied with other matters asto render it very improbable that the affair of the murder wouldthen come up had endeavoured to get permission to postpone carrysjourney but the little men in authority are always stern on suchpoints and witnesses are usually treated as persons who are notentitled to have any views as to their own personal comfort orwelfare</s>  lawyers who are paid for their presence may plead otherengagements and their pleas will be considered and if a witness bea lord it may perhaps be thought very hard that he should be draggedaway from his amusements</s>  but the ordinary commonplace witness mustsimply listen and obeyat his peril</s>  it was thus decided that carrymust be in salisbury on the wednesday and remain there hangingabout the court till her services should be wanted</s>  fenwick who hadbeen in salisbury had seen that accommodation should be provided forher and for the miller at the house of mrs</s>  stiggs</s> the miller had decided upon going with his daughter</s>  the vicar didnot go down to the mill again but mrs</s>  fenwick had seen brattle andhad learned that such was to be the case</s>  the old man said nothing tohis own people about it till the monday afternoon up to which timefanny was prepared to accompany her sister</s>  he was then told when hecame in from the mill for his tea that word had come down from thevicarage that there would be two bedrooms for them at mrs</s>  stiggshouse</s>  i dont know why there should be the cost of a second roomsaid fanny carry and i wont want two beds</s> up to this time there had been no reconciliation between the millerand his younger daughter</s>  carry would ask her father whether sheshould do this or that and the miller would answer her as a surlymaster will answer a servant whom he does not like but the fatheras a father had never spoken to the child nor up to this momenthad he said a word even to his wife of his intended journey tosalisbury</s>  but now he was driven to speak</s>  he had placed himself inthe arm chair and was sitting with his hands on his knees gazinginto the empty firegrate</s>  carry was standing at the open windowpulling the dead leaves off three or four geraniums which her motherkept there in pots</s>  fanny was passing in and out from the backkitchen in which the water for their tea was being boiled and mrs</s> brattle was in her usual place with her spectacles on and a darningneedle in her hand</s>  a minute was allowed to pass by before the milleranswered his eldest daughter</s> therell be two beds wanted he said i told muster fenwick as idgo with the girl myselfand so i wull</s> carry started so that she broke the flower which she was touching</s> mrs</s>  brattle immediately stopped her needle and withdrew herspectacles from her nose</s>  fanny who was that instant bringing theteapot out of the back kitchen put it down among the tea cups andstood still to consider what she had heard</s> dear dear dear</s>  said the mother</s> father said fanny coming up to him and just touching him withher hand twill be best for you to go much best</s>  i am heartilyglad on it and so will carry be</s> i knows nowt about that said the miller but i mean to go andthats all about it</s>  i aint a been to salsbry these fifteen year andmore and i shant be there never again</s> theres no saying that father said fanny</s> and it aint for no pleasure as im agoing now</s>  nobody ll spectthat of me</s>  id liever let the millstone come on my foot</s> there was nothing more said about it that evening nothing more atleast in the millers hearing</s>  carry and her sister were discussingit nearly the whole night</s>  it was very soon plain to fanny that carryhad heard the tidings with dismay</s>  to be alone with her father fortwo three or perhaps four days seemed to her to be so terriblethat she hardly knew how to face the misery and gloom of hiscompanyin addition to the fears she had as to what they would sayand do to her in the court</s>  since she had been home she had learnedalmost to tremble at the sound of her fathers foot and yet she hadknown that he would not harm her would hardly notice her would notdo more than look at her</s>  but now for three long frightful days tocome she would be subject to his wrath during every moment of herlife</s> will he speak to me fanny dye think</s>  she asked</s> of course hell speak to you child</s> but he hasnt you knownot since ive been home not once not ashe does to you and mother</s>  i know he hates me and wishes i was dead</s> and fanny i wishes it myself every day of my life</s> he wishes nothing of the kind carry</s> why dont he say one kind word to me then</s>  i know ive been bad</s> but i aint a done a single thing since ive been home as d a madehim angry if he seed it or said a word as he mightnt a heard</s> i dont think you have dear</s> then why cant he come round if it was ever so little</s>  id soonerhed beat me that i would</s> hell never do that carry</s>  i dont know as he ever laid a hand uponone of us since we was little things</s> it d be better than never speaking to a girl</s>  only for you andmother fan id be off again</s> you would not</s>  you know you would not</s>  how dare you say that</s> but why shouldnt he say a word to one so that one shouldnt goabout like a dead body in the house</s> carry dear listen to this</s>  if youll manage well if youll be goodto him and patient while you are with him if youll bear with himand yet be gentle when hei am gentlealwaysnow</s> you are dear but when he speaks as hell have to speak whenyoure all alone like be very gentle</s>  maybe carry when youve comeback he will be gentle with you</s> they had ever so much more to discuss</s>  would sam be at the trial</s> and if so would he and his father speak to each other</s>  they hadboth been told that sam had been summoned and that the police wouldenforce his attendance but they were neither of them sure whetherhe would be there in custody or as a free man</s>  at last they went tosleep but carrys slumbers were not very sound</s>  as has been toldbefore it was the millers custom to be up every morning at five</s> the two girls would afterwards rise at six and then an hour afterthat mrs</s>  brattle would be instructed that her time had come</s>  onthe tuesday morning however the miller was not the first of thefamily to leave his bed</s>  carry crept out of hers by the earliestdawn of daylight without waking her sister and put on her clothesstealthily</s>  then she made her way silently to the front door whichshe opened and stood there outside waiting till her father shouldcome</s>  the morning though it was in august was chill and the timeseemed to be very long</s>  she had managed to look at the old clock asshe passed and had seen that it wanted a quarter to five</s>  she knewthat her father was never later than five</s>  what if on this specialmorning he should not come just because she had resolved after manyinward struggles to make one great effort to obtain his pardon</s> at last he was coming</s>  she heard his step in the passage and thenshe was aware that he had stopped when he found the fastenings ofthe door unloosed</s>  she perceived too that he delayed to examine thelockas it was natural that he should do and she had forgottenthat he would be arrested by the open door</s>  thinking of this in themoment of time that was allowed to her she hurried forward andencountered him</s> father she said it is i</s> he was angry that she should have dared to unbolt the door or towithdraw the bars</s>  what was she that she should be trusted to openor to close the house</s>  and there came upon him some idea of wantonand improper conduct</s>  why was she there at that hour</s>  must it be thathe should put her again from the shelter of his roof</s> carry was clever enough to perceive in a moment what was passing inthe old mans mind</s>  father she said it was to see you</s>  and ithoughtperhapsi might say it out here</s>  he believed her atonce</s>  in whatever spirit he might accept her present effort thatother idea had already vanished</s>  she was there that they two might bealone together in the fresh morning air and he knew that it was so</s> father she said looking up into his face</s>  then she fell on theground at his feet and embraced his knees and lay there sobbing</s> she had intended to ask him for forgiveness but she was not able tosay a word</s>  nor did he speak for awhile but he stooped and raisedher up tenderly and then when she was again standing by him hestepped on as though he were going to the mill without a word</s>  but hehad not rebuked her and his touch had been very gentle</s>  fathershe said following him if you could forgive me</s>  i know i have beenbad but if you could forgive me</s> he went to the very door of the mill before he turned and she whenshe saw that he did not come back to her paused upon the bridge</s>  shehad used all her eloquence</s>  she knew no other words with which tomove him</s>  she felt that she had failed but she could do no more</s>  buthe stopped again without entering the mill</s> child he said at last come here then</s>  she ran at once to meethim</s>  i will forgive thee</s>  there</s>  i will forgive thee and trust thoumayst be a better girl than thou hast been</s> she flew to him and threw her arms round his neck and kissed his faceand breast</s>  oh father she said i will be good</s>  i will try to begood</s>  only you will speak to me</s> illustration oh father she said i will be good</s> get thee into the house now</s>  i have forgiven thee</s>  so saying hepassed on to his mornings work</s> carry running into the house at once roused her sister</s>  fannyshe exclaimed he has forgiven me at last he has said that he willforgive me</s> but to the millers mind and to his sense of justice theforgiveness thus spoken did not suffice</s>  when he returned tobreakfast mrs</s>  brattle had of course been told of the morningswork and had rejoiced greatly</s>  it was to her as though the greatestburden of her life had now been taken from her weary back</s>  her girlto her loving motherly heart now that he who had in all things beenthe lord of her life had vouchsafed his pardon to the poor sinnerwould be as pure as when she had played about the mill in all hergirlish innocence</s>  the mother had known that her child was stillunder a cloud but the cloud to her had consisted in the fatherswrath rather than in the feeling of any public shame</s>  to her a sinrepented was a sin no more and her love for her child made her sureof the sincerity of that repentance</s>  but there could be no joy overthe sinner in this world till the head of the house should again havetaken her to his heart</s>  when the miller came in to his breakfast thethree women were standing together not without some outward marks ofcontentment</s>  mrs</s>  brattles cap was clean and even fanny who wasever tidy and never smart had managed in some way to add somethingbright to her appearance</s>  where is the woman who when she has beenpleased will not show her pleasure by some sign in her outwardgarniture</s>  but still there was anxiety</s>  will he call me carry</s>  thegirl had asked</s>  he had not done so when he pronounced her pardonat the mill door</s>  though they were standing together they had notdecided on any line of action</s>  the pardon had been spoken and theywere sure that it would not be revoked but how it would operate atfirst none of them had even guessed</s> the miller when he had entered the room and come among them stoodwith his two hands resting on the round table and thus he addressedthem it was a bad time with us when the girl whom we had all lovedamost too well forgot herself and us and brought us to shamewewho had never known shame aforeand became a thing so vile as iwont name it</s>  it was well nigh the death o me i know</s> oh father</s>  exclaimed fanny</s> hold your peace fanny and let me say my say out</s>  it was verybad then and when she come back to us and was took in so thatshe might have her bit to eat under an honest roof it was badstillfor she was a shame to us as had never been shamed afore</s>  formyself i felt so that though she was allays near me my heart wasaway from her and she was not one with me not as her sister is oneand her mother who never knowd a thought in her heart as wasnt fitfor a woman to have there</s>  by this time carry was sobbing on hermothers bosom and it would be difficult to say whose affliction wasthe sharpest</s>  but them as falls may right themselves unless they bechance killed as they falls</s>  if my child be sorry for her sinoh father i am sorry</s> i will bring myself to forgive her</s>  that it wont stick here andthe miller struck his heart violently with his open palm i wont besuch a liar as to say</s>  for there aint no good in a lie</s>  but thereshall be never a word about it more out o my mouthand she maycome to me again as my child</s> there was a solemnity about the old mans speech which struck themall with so much awe that none of them for a while knew how to moveor to speak</s>  fanny was the first to stir and she came to him and puther arm through his and leaned her head upon his shoulder</s> get me my breakfast girl he said to her</s>  but before he had movedcarry had thrown herself weeping on his bosom</s>  that will do hesaid</s>  that will do</s>  sit down and eat thy victuals</s>  then there wasnot another word said and the breakfast passed off in silence</s> though the women talked of what had occurred throughout the day nota word more dropped from the millers mouth upon the subject</s>  whenhe came in to dinner he took his food from carrys hand and thankedheras he would have thanked his elder daughterbut he did notcall her by her name</s>  much had to be done in preparing for themorrows journey and for the days through which they two might bedetained at the assizes</s>  the miller had borrowed a cart in whichhe was to drive himself and his daughter to the bullhampton roadstation and when he went to bed he expressed his determination ofstarting at nine so as to catch a certain train into salisbury</s>  theyhad been told that it would be sufficient if they were in the citythat day at one oclock</s> on the next morning the miller was in his mill as usual in themorning</s>  he said nothing about the work but the women knew that itmust in the main stand still</s>  everything could not be trusted to oneman and that man a hireling</s>  but nothing was said of this</s>  he wentinto his mill and the women prepared his breakfast and the cleanshirt and the tidy sunday coat in which he was to travel</s>  and carrywas ready dressed for the journeyso pretty with her bright curlsand sweet dimpled cheeks but still with that look of fear and sorrowwhich the coming ordeal could not but produce</s>  the miller returneddressed himself as he was desired and took his place at the table inthe kitchen when the front door was again openedand sam brattlestood among them</s> father said he ive turned up just in time</s> of course the consternation among them was great but no referencewas made to the quarrel which had divided the father and son whenlast they had parted</s>  sam explained that he had come across thecountry from the north travelling chiefly by railway but that hehad walked from the swindon station to marlborough on the precedingevening and from thence to bullhampton that morning</s>  he had come bybirmingham and gloucester and thence to swindon</s> and now mother if youll give me a mouthful of someat to eat youwont find that im above eating of it</s> he had been summoned to salisbury he said for that day but nothingshould induce him to go there till the friday</s>  he surmised that heknew a thing or two and as the trial wouldnt come off before fridayat the earliest he wouldnt show his face in salisbury before thatday</s>  he strongly urged carry to be equally sagacious and used someenergetic arguments to the same effect on his father when he foundthat his father was also to be at the assizes but the miller did notlike to be taught by his son and declared that as the legal documentsaid wednesday on the wednesday his daughter should be there</s> and what about the mill</s>  asked sam</s>  the miller only shook his head</s> then theres only so much more call for me to stay them two dayssaid sam</s>  ill be at it hammer and tongs father till its time forme to start o friday</s>  you tell em as how im coming</s>  ill be thereafore they want me</s>  and when theyve got me they wont get much outof me i guess</s> to all this the miller made no reply not forbidding his son to workthe mill nor thanking him for the offer</s>  but mrs</s>  brattle and fannywho could read every line in his face knew that he was wellpleased</s> and then there was the confusion of the start</s>  fanny in hersolicitude for her father brought out a little cushion for hisseat</s>  i dont want no cushion to sit on said he give it here tocarry</s>  it was the first time that he had called her by her name andit was not lost on the poor girl</s> chapter lxvii</s> sir gregory marrable has a headache</s> mary lowther in her letter to her aunt had in one line told thestory of her rupture with mr</s>  gilmore</s>  this line had formed apostscript and the writer had hesitated much before she added it</s> she had not intended to write to her aunt on this subject but shehad remembered at the last moment how much easier it would be to tellthe remainder of her story on her arrival at loring if so much hadalready been told beforehand</s>  therefore it was that she had addedthese words</s>  everything has been broken off between me and mr</s> gilmorefor ever</s> this was a terrible blow upon poor miss marrable who up to themoment of her receiving that letter thought that her niece wasdisposed of in the manner that had seemed most desirable to all herfriends</s>  aunt sarah loved her niece dearly and by no means lookedforward to improved happiness in her own old age when she should beleft alone in the house at uphill but she entertained the view aboutyoung women which is usual with old women who have young women undertheir charge and she thought it much best that this special youngwoman should get herself married</s>  the old women are right in theirviews on this matter and the young women who on this point are notoften refractory are right also</s>  miss marrable who entertained avery strong opinion on the subject abovementioned was very unhappywhen she was thus abruptly told by her own peculiar young woman thatthis second engagement had been broken off and sent to the winds</s>  ithad become a theory on the part of marys friends that the gilmorematch was the proper thing for her</s>  at last after many difficultiesthe gilmore match had been arranged</s>  the anxiety as to marys futurelife was at an end and the theory of the elders concerned withher welfare was to be carried out</s>  then there came a short noteproclaiming her return home and simply telling as a fact almostindifferentin a single linethat all the trouble hitherto takenas to her own disposition had entirely been thrown away</s>  everythinghas been broken off between me and mr</s>  gilmore</s>  it was a cruel and aheartrending postscript</s> poor miss marrable knew very well that she was armed with no parentalauthority</s>  she could hold her theory and could advise but she coulddo no more</s>  she could not even scold</s>  and there had been some qualmof conscience on her part as to walter marrable now that waltermarrable had been taken in hand and made much of by the baronetandnow also that poor gregory had been removed from the path</s>  no doubtshe aunt sarah had done all in her power to aid the difficultieswhich had separated the two cousinsand while she thought that thegilmore match had been the consequence of such aiding on her partshe was happy enough in reflecting upon what she had done</s>  old sirgregory would not have taken walter by the hand unless walter hadbeen free to marry edith brownlow and though she could not quiteresolve that the death of the younger gregory had been part of thefamily arrangement due to the happy policy of the elder marrablesgenerally still she was quite sure that walters present positionat dunripple had come entirely from the favour with which he hadregarded the baronets wishes as to edith</s>  mary was provided for withthe squire who was in immediate possession and walter with hisbride would become as it were the eldest son of dunripple</s>  it wasall as comfortable as could be till there came this unfortunatepostscript</s> the letter reached her on friday and on saturday mary arrived</s>  missmarrable determined that she would not complain</s>  as regarded her owncomfort it was doubtless all for the best</s>  but old women are neverselfish in regard to the marriage of young women</s>  that the youngwomen belonging to them should be settledand thus got rid ofisno doubt the great desire but whether the old woman be herselfmarried or a spinster the desire is founded on an adamantineconfidence that marriage is the most proper and the happiest thingfor the young woman</s>  the belief is so thorough that the woman wouldcease to be a woman would already have become a brute who woulddesire to keep any girl belonging to her out of matrimony for thesake of companionship to herself</s>  but no woman does so desire inregard to those who are dear and near to her</s>  a dependant distantin blood or a paid assistant may find here and there a want of thetrue feminine sympathy but in regard to a daughter or one held asa daughter it is never wanting</s>  as the pelican loveth her young doi love thee and therefore will i give thee away in marriage to someone strong enough to hold thee even though my heartstrings be tornasunder by the parting</s>  such is always the hearts declaration ofthe mother respecting her daughter</s>  the matchmaking of mothers isthe natural result of mothers love for the ambition of one womanfor another is never other than thisthat the one loved by hershall be given to a man to be loved more worthily</s>  poor aunt sarahconsidering of these things during those two lonely days came to theconclusion that if ever mary were to be so loved again that she mightbe given away a long time might first elapse and then she was awarethat such gifts given late lose much of their value and have to begiven cheaply</s> mary herself as she was driven slowly up the hill to her auntsdoor did not share her aunts melancholy</s>  to be returned as a badshilling which has been presented over the counter and found to bebad must be very disagreeable to a young womans feelings</s>  that wasnot the case with mary lowther</s>  she had no doubt a great sorrowat heart</s>  she had created a shipwreck which she did regret mostbitterly</s>  but the sorrow and the regret were not humiliating as theywould have been had they been caused by failure on her own part</s>  andthen she had behind her the strong comfort of her own rock of whichnothing should now rob herwhich should be a rock for rest andsafety and not a rock for shipwreck and as to the disposition ofwhich aunt sarahs present ideas were so very erroneous</s> it was impossible that the first evening should pass without a wordor two about poor gilmore</s>  mary knew well enough that she had toldher aunt nothing of her renewed engagement with her cousin butshe

said aunt sarah after a pause</s> this certainly was not the most exhilarating view which might havebeen taken of the matter as far as mary was concerned but as it didnot suggest any open opposition to her scheme and as there was norefusal to see walter when he should again appear at uphill as herlover she made no complaint</s>  miss marrable went on to inquire howsir gregory would like these plans which were so diametricallyopposed to his own</s>  as to that mary could say nothing</s>  no doubtwalter would make a clean breast of it to sir gregory before he leftdunripple and would be able to tell them what had passed when hecame to loring</s>  mary however did not forget to argue that theground on which walter marrable stood was his own ground</s>  after thedeath of two men the

shortand there was not a word in it about sir gregory or edith brownlow</s> it only said that he was the happiest man in the world and that hewould be at loring on the following saturday</s>  he must return at onceto birmingham but would certainly be at loring on saturday</s>  he hadwritten to his uncle to ask for hospitality</s>  he did not suppose thatparson john would refuse but should this be

brother say</s>
sir gregory you mean</s> of course i mean sir gregory</s>
 i dont suppose youd ask yourfather</s> i never had the slightest intention sir of asking either one orthe other</s>  i dont suppose that i am to ask his leave to be marriedlike a young girl and it

made beyond that</s>  the sunday had been wet frommorning to night and nothing could possibly be more disconsolatethan the aspect of things round the house or more disreputable ifthey were to be left in their present condition</s>  the barrows and theplanks and the pickaxes had been taken away which things thoughthey are not in themselves beautiful are safeguards against theilleffects of ugliness

paths had become the beds of stagnant pools</s> the vicar then went into the house and though there was still aworkman and a boy who were listlessly pulling about some rolls ofpaper there were ample signs that misfortune had come and thatneglect was the consequence</s>  and all this said fenwick to himselfbecause the man cannot get the idea of a certain woman out of hishead</s>  then he thought of himself and his own character and askedhimself whether in any position of life he could have been thusoverruled to misery by circumstances altogether outside himself</s> misfortunes might come which would be very heavy his wife orchildren might die or he might become a pauper or subject to somecrushing disease</s>  but gilmores trouble had not fallen upon him fromthe hands of providence</s>  he had set his heart upon the gaining of athing and was now absolutely brokenhearted because he could nothave it</s>  and the thing was a woman</s>  fenwick admitted to himself thatthe thing itself was the most worthy for which a man can strugglebut would not admit that even in his search for that a man shouldallow his heart to give way or his strength to be broken down</s> he went up to the house again on the wednesday and again on thethursdaybut nothing had been heard from the squire</s>  the bailiffwas very unhappy</s>  even though there might come a cheque on thesaturday morning which both fenwick and the bailiff thought to beprobable still there would be grave difficulties</s> herell be the first of september on us afore we know where we aresaid the bailiff and is we to go on with the horses</s> for the squire was of all men the most regular and began to gethis horses into condition on the first of september as regularly ashe began to shoot partridges</s>  the vicar went home and then made uphis mind that he would go up to london after his friend</s>  he mustprovide for his next sundays duty but he could do that out of aneighbouring parish and he would start on the morrow</s>  he arrangedthe matter with his wife and with his friends curate and on thefriday he started</s> he drove himself into salisbury instead of to the bullhampton roadstation in order that he might travel by the express train</s>  that atleast was the reason which he gave to himself and to his wife</s>  butthere was present to his mind the idea that he might look into thecourt and see how

witness against a man whom she had once been engaged tomarry would certainly meet with no mercy from a crossexaminingbarrister</s>  the broad landmarks between the respectable and thedisreputable may guide the tone of a lawyer somewhat when he has awitness in his power but the finer lines which separate that whichis at the moment good and true from that which is false and badcannot be discerned amidst the turmoil of a trial unless the eyesand the ears and the inner touch of him who has the handling of thevictim be of a quality more than ordinarily high</s> the vicar drove himself over to salisbury and had an hour there forstrolling into the court</s>  he had heard on the previous day that thecase would be brought on the first thing on the friday and it washalfpast eleven when he made his way in through the crowd</s>  the trainby which he was to be taken on to london did not start till halfpasttwelve</s>  at that moment the court was occupied in deciding whethera certain tradesman

entrusted with an affair of life and death</s>  to aproposition in itself so reasonable no direct answer was made but itwas argued with great power on behalf of the crown which seemed tothink at the

soon as the club was open</s>  he did not eat his breakfastin the house nor as far as the porters memory went did he evenenter the club</s>  fenwick had lodged himself at an hotel in theimmediate neighbourhood of pallmall and he made up his mind thathis only chance of catching his friend was to be at the steps ofthe club door when it was opened at nine oclock</s>  so he eat hisdinnervery much in solitude for on the 28th of august it is notoften that the coffee rooms of clubs are fulland in the eveningtook himself to one of the theatres which was still open</s>  his clubhad been deserted and it had seemed to him that the streets alsowere empty</s>  one old gentleman who together with himself hademployed the forces of the establishment that evening had told himthat there wasnt a single

dropped down to deans yard to see a clericalfriendbut the house was shut up and he could not even get ananswer</s>  he sauntered into the abbey and found them mending theorgan</s>  he got into a cab and was driven hither and thither becauseall the streets were pulled up</s>  he called at the waroffice tosee a young clerk and found one old messenger fast asleep inhis armchair</s>  gone for his holiday sir said the man in thearmchair speaking amidst his dreams without waiting to hear theparticular name of the young clerk who was wanted</s>  and yet when hegot to the theatre it was so full that he could hardly find a seaton which to sit</s>  in all the world around us there is nothing moresingular than the emptiness and the fullness of london</s> he was up early the next morning and breakfasted before he went outthinking that even should he succeed in catching the squire he wouldnot be able to persuade the unhappy man to come and breakfast withhim</s>  at a little before nine he was in pallmall walking up and downbefore the club and as the clocks struck the hour he began to beimpatient</s>  the porter had said that gilmore always came exactly atnine and within two minutes after that hour the vicar began to feelthat his friend was breaking an engagement and behaving badly to him</s> by ten minutes past the idea had got into his head that all thepeople in pallmall were watching him and at the quarter he wasangry and unhappy</s>  he had just counted the seconds up to twentyminutes and had begun to consider that it would be absurd for him towalk there all the day when he saw the squire coming slowly alongthe street</s>  he had been afraid to make himself comfortable within theclub and there to wait for his friends coming lest gilmore shouldhave escaped him not choosing to be thus caught by any oneandeven now he had his fear lest his quarry should slip through hisfingers</s>  he waited till the squire had gone up to the porter andreturned to the street and

back to the privets</s>  this headded after a pause during which the vicar had been thinking whatnew arguments he could bring up to urge his friends return</s> fenwick learned that gilmore had sent a cheque to his bailiff by thepost of the preceding night</s>  he acknowledged that in sending thecheque he had said no more than to bid the man pay what wages weredue</s>  he had not as yet made up his mind as to any further steps</s>  asthey walked round the enclosure of st</s>  jamess park together and asthe warmth of their old friendship produced freedom of intercoursegilmore acknowledged a dozen wild schemes that had passed through hisbrain</s>  that to which he was most wedded was a plan for meeting waltermarrable and cudgelling him pretty well to death</s>  fenwick pointedout three or four objections to this</s>  in the first place marrablehad committed no offence whatever against gilmore</s>  and then in allprobability marrable might be as good at cudgelling as the squirehimself</s>  and thirdly when the cudgelling was over the man who beganthe row would certainly be put into prison and in atonement for thatwould receive no public sympathy</s>  you cant throw yourself on thepublic pity as a woman might said the vicar</s> d the public pity said the squire who was not often driven tomake his language forcible after that fashion</s> another scheme was that he would publish the whole transaction</s>  andhere again his friend was obliged to remind him that a man in hisposition should be reticent rather than outspoken</s>  you have alreadydeclared said the vicar that you cant endure failure and yetyou want to make your failure known to all the world</s>  his thirdproposition was more absurd still</s>  he would write such a letter tomary lowther as would cover her head with red hot coals</s>  he wouldtell her that she had made the world utterly unbearable to him andthat she might have the privets for herself and go and live there</s>  ido not doubt but that such a letter would annoy her said the vicar</s> why should i care how much she is annoyed</s> just sobut everyone who saw the letter would know that it waspretence and bombast</s>  of course you will do nothing of the kind</s> they were together pretty nearly the whole day</s>  gilmore no doubtwould have avoided the vicar in the morning had it been possiblebut now that he had been caught and had been made to undergohis friends lectures he was rather grateful than otherwise forsomething in the shape of society</s>  it was fenwicks desire to inducehim to return to bullhampton</s>  if this could not be done it would nodoubt be well that some authority should be obtained from him as tothe management of the place</s>  but this subject had not been mootedas yet because fenwick felt that if he once acknowledged that therunaway might continue to be a runaway his chance of bringing theman back to his own home would be much lessened</s>  as yet however hehad made no impression in that direction</s>  at last they parted on anunderstanding that they were to breakfast together the next morningat fenwicks hotel and then go to the eleven oclock sunday serviceat a certain noted metropolitan church</s>  at breakfast and duringthe walk to church fenwick said not a word to his friend aboutbullhampton</s>  he talked of church services of ritual of thequietness of a sunday in london and of the sunday occupations ofthree millions of people not a fourth of whom attend divine service</s> he chose any subject other than that of which gilmore was thinking</s> but as soon as they were out of church he made another attack uponhim</s>  after that harry dont you feel like trying to do your duty</s> i feel that i cant fly because my wing is broken said the squire</s> they spent the whole of the afternoon and evening together but nogood was done</s>  gilmore as far as he had a plan intended to goabroad travel to the east or to the westor to the south if soit came about</s>  the privets might be let if any would choose to takethe place</s>  as far as he was concerned his income from his tenantswould be more than he wanted</s>  as for doing them any good i neverdid them any good he said as he parted from the vicar for thenight</s>  if they cant live on the land without my being at home i amsure they wont if i stay there</s> chapter lxix</s> the trial</s> the miller as he was starting from his house door had calledhis daughter by her own name for the first time since her returnhomeand carry had been comforted</s>  but no further comfort cameto her during her journey to salisbury from her fathers speech</s> he hardly spoke the whole morning and when he did say a word asto any matter on the work they had in hand his voice was low andmelancholy</s>  carry knew well as did every one at bullhampton thather father was a man not much given to conversation and she had notexpected him to talk to her but the silence together with the loadat her heart as to the ordeal of her examination was very heavy onher</s>  if she could have asked questions and received encouragementshe could have borne her position comparatively with ease</s> the instructions with which the miller was furnished required thatcarry brattle should present herself at a certain office in salisburyat a certain hour on that wednesday</s>  exactly at that hour she andher father were at the place indicated already having visited theirlodgings at mrs</s>  stiggs</s>  they were then told that they would not beagain wanted on that day but that they must infallibly be in thecourt the next morning at halfpast nine</s>  the attorneys clerk whomthey saw when he learned that sam brattle was not yet in salisburyexpressed an opinion as to that young mans iniquity which led carryto think that he was certainly in more danger than either of theprisoners</s>  as they left the office she suggested to her father thata message should be immediately sent to bullhampton after sam</s>  letun be said the miller and it was all that he did say</s>  on thatevening they retired to the interior of one of the bedrooms attrotters buildings at four oclock in the afternoon and did notleave the house again</s>  anything more dreary than those hours couldnot be imagined</s>  the miller who was accustomed to work hard allday and then to rest did not know what to do with his limbs</s> carry seeing his misery and thinking rather of that than her ownsuggested to him that they should go out and walk round the town</s> bide as thee be said the miller it aint no time now for showingtheeself</s>  carry took the rebuke without a word but turned her headto hide her tears</s> and the next day was worse because it was longer</s>  exactly athalfpast nine they were down at the court and there they hung abouttill halfpast ten</s>  then they were told that their affair would notbe brought on till the friday but that at halfpast nine on thatday it would undoubtedly be commenced and that if sam was not therethen it would go very hard with sam</s>  the miller who was beginningto lose his respect for the young man from whom he received thesecommunications muttered something about sam being all right</s>  youllfind he wont be all right if he isnt here at halfpast ninetomorrow said the young man</s>  there is them as their bark is worsethan their bite said the miller</s>  then they went back to trottersbuildings and did not stir outside of mrs</s>  stiggs house throughoutthe whole day</s> on the friday which was in truth to be the day of the trial theywere again in court at halfpast nine and there as we have seenthey were found two hours later by mr</s>  fenwick waiting patientlywhile the great preliminary affair of the dealer in meat was beingsettled</s>  at that hour sam had not made his appearance but betweentwelve and one he sauntered into the comfortless room in which carrywas still sitting with her father</s>  the sight of him was a joy to poorcarry as he would speak to her and tell her something of what wasgoing on</s>  im about in time for the play father he said comingup to them</s>  the miller picked up his hat and scratched his head andmuttered something</s>  but there had been a sparkle in his eye when hesaw sam</s>  in truth the sight in all the world most agreeable to theold mans eyes was the figure of his youngest son</s>  to the miller noapollo could have

inform them thatthe big swell of all was making a speech in which he was tellingeverybody every varsal thing about it</s>  and what do you thinkfather</s> i dont think nothing said the miller</s>

they smash it into atoms</s> them as goes crooked in big things is like to go crooked in littlesaid the miller</s> at about two sam and carry were told to go into court and waywas made for the old man to accompany them</s>  at that moment thecrossexamination was being continued of the man who early on thesunday morning had seen the grinder with his companion in the carton the road leading towards pycroft common</s>  a big burly barristerwith a broad forehead and grey eyes was questioning this witness asto the identity of the men in the cart and at every answer that hereceived he turned round to the jury as though he would say therethen what do you think of the case now when such a man as that isbrought before you to give evidence</s>  you will swear then thatthese two men who are here in the dock were the two men you saw thatmorning in that cart</s>  the witness said that he would so swear</s>  youknew them both before of course</s>  the witness declared that he hadnever seen either of them before in his life</s>  and you expect thejury to believe now that the lives of these men depend on theirbelieving it that after the lapse of a year you can identify thesetwo men whom you had never seen before and who were at that timebeing carried along the road at the rate of eight or ten miles anhour</s>  the witness who had already encountered a good many of thesequestions and who was inclined to be rough rather than timid saidthat he didnt care twopence what the jury believed</s>  it was simplyhis business to tell what he knew</s>  then the judge looked at thatwicked witnesswho had talked in this wretched jeering way abouttwopence</s> looked at him over his spectacles and shaking his head asthough with pity at that witnesss wickedness cautioned him as tothe peril of his body

that any man should be hung for any offence against whomsuch a witness as this was brought up to give testimony</s>  it was themanifest feeling of the crowd in the court that the witness himselfought to be hung immediately</s>  you may go down sir said the burlybarrister giving an impression to those who looked on but did notunderstand that the case was over as far as it depended on thatmans evidence</s>  the burly barrister himself was not so sanguine</s> he knew very well that the judge who had wagged his head in somelancholy a way at the iniquity of a witness who had dared tosay that he didnt care twopence would when he was summing uprefer to the presence of the two prisoners in the cart as a thingfairly supported by evidence</s>  the amount of the burly barristersachievement was simply thisthat for the moment a sort of sympathywas excited on behalf of the prisoners by the disapprobation whichwas aroused against the wicked man who hadnt cared twopence</s> sympathy like electricity will run so quick that no man may stopit</s>  if sympathy might be made to run through the jurybox there mightperchance be a man or two there weak enough to entertain it to theprejudice of his duty on that day</s>  the hopes of the burly barristerin this matter did not go further than that</s> then there was another man put forward who had seen neither of theprisoners but had seen the cart and pony at pycroft common and hadknown that the cart and pony were for the time in the possession ofthe grinder</s>  he was questioned by the burly barrister about himselfrather than about his evidence and when he had been made to own thathe had been five times in prison the burly barrister was almostjustified in the look he gave to the jury and he shook his head asthough in sorrow that his learned friend on the other side shouldhave dared to bring such a man as that before them as a witness</s> various others were brought up and examined before poor carrys turnhad come and on each

she so dreaded the moment when itshould come there was a sense of wretched disappointment in thatshe was kept waiting</s>  it was now between four and five and whispersbegan to be rife that the crown

the heart of the mouthpiece was tender and hewas beginning to hate the burly barrister</s>  my dear said the burlybarrister the jury must have the information from you</s> then gradually there was

ingeneral</s>  it did not matter where the people of the lord met hesaid so long as they did meet to worship the lord in a properspirit of independent resistance to any authority that had not cometo them from revelation</s>  any hedgeside was a sufficient tabernaclefor a devout christian</s>  but and then without naming any name hedescribed the church of england as a upas tree which by its poisondestroyed those beautiful flowers which strove to spring up amidstthe rank grass beneath it and to make the air sweet within itsneighbourhood</s>  something he said too of a weak sister tottering toits base only to be followed in its ruin by the speedy prostrationof its elder brother</s>  all this was of course told in detail to thevicar but the vicar refused even to be interested by it</s>  of coursehe did said the vicar</s>  if a man is to preach what can he preachbut his own views</s> the tidings to be made in a pleasant spirit were not long waitedforor at any rate the first instalment of them</s>  on the 2nd ofseptember there arrived a large hamper full of partridges addressedto mrs</s>  fenwick in the earls own handwriting</s>  the very firstfruits said the vicar as he went down to inspect the plentifulprovision thus made for the vicarage larder</s>  wellit was certainlybetter to have partridges from turnover than accusations ofimmorality and infidelity</s>  the vicar so declared at once but hiswife would not at first agree with him</s>  i really should have suchpleasure in packing them up and sending them back said she</s> indeed you shall do nothing of the kind</s> the idea of a basket of birds to atone for such insults and calumnyas that man has heaped on you</s> the birds will be only a first instalment said the vicarandthen there were more quips and quirks about that</s>  it was presumed bymr</s>  fenwick that the second instalment would be the first pheasantsshot in october</s>  but the second instalment came before september wasover in the shape of the following note turnover park 20th september 186</s>  the marquis of trowbridge and the ladies sophie and carolina stowte request that mr</s>  and mrs</s>  fenwick will do them the honour of coming to turnover park on monday the 6th october and staying till saturday the 11th</s> thats an instalment indeed said mrs</s>  fenwick</s>  and now what onearth are we to do</s>  the vicar admitted that it had become veryserious</s>  we must either go and endure a terrible time of itcontinued mrs</s>  fenwick or we must show him very plainly that wewill have nothing more to do with him</s>  i dont see why we are to beannoyed merely because he is a marquis</s> it wont be because he is a marquis</s> why then</s>  you cant say that you love the old man or that theladies sophie and carolina stowte are the women youd have me choosefor companions or that that soapy silky humbugging lord st</s>  georgeis to your taste</s> i am not sure about st</s>  george</s>  he can be everything to everybodyand would make an excellent bishop</s> you know you dont like him and you know also that you will have avery bad time of it at turnover</s> i could shoot pheasants all the week</s> yeswith a conviction at the time that the ladies sophie andcarolina were calling you an infidel behind your back for doing so</s> as for myself i feel perfectly certain that i should spar with them</s> it isnt because hes a marquis said the vicar carrying on hisargument after a long pause</s>  if i know myself i think i may saythat that has no allurement for me</s>  and to tell the truth had hebeen simply a marquis and had i been at liberty to indulge my ownwishes i would never have allowed myself to be talked out of myrighteous anger by that softtongued son of his</s>  but to us he is aman of the very greatest importance because he owns the land onwhich the people live with whom we are concerned</s>  it is for theirwelfare that he and i should be on good terms together and thereforeif you dont mind the sacrifice i think well go</s> whatfor the whole week frank</s> the vicar was of opinion that the week might be judiciouslycurtailed by two days and consequently mrs</s>  fenwick presented hercompliments to the ladies sophie and carolina stowte and expressedthe great pleasure which she and mr</s>  fenwick would have in going toturnover park on the tuesday and staying till the friday</s> so that i shall only be shooting two days said the vicar whichwill modify the aspect of my infidelity considerably</s> they went to turnover castle</s>  the poor old marquis had rather a badtime of it for the hour or two previous to their arrival</s>  it hadbecome an acknowledged fact now in the county that sam brattle hadhad nothing to do with the murder of farmer trumbull and that hisacquaintance with the murderers had sprung from his desire to see hisunfortunate sister settled in marriage with a man whom he at the timedid not know to be disreputable</s>  there had therefore been a reactionin favour of sam brattle whom the county now began to regard assomething of a hero</s>  the marquis understanding all that had come tobe aware that he had wronged the vicar in that matter of the murder</s> and then though he had been told upon very good authorityno lessthan that of his daughters who had been so informed by the sistersof a most exemplary neighbouring curatethat mr</s>  fenwick was a manwho believed just next to nothing and would just as soon associatewith a downright pagan like old brattle as with any professingchristianstill there was the fact of the bishops good opinionand though the marquis was a selfwilled man to him a bishop wasalways a bishop</s>  it was also clear to him that he had been misled inthose charges which he had made against the vicar in that matter ofpoor carry brattles residence at salisbury</s>  something of the truthof the girls history had come to the ears of the marquis and hehad been made to believe that he had been wrong</s>  then there was theaffair of the chapel in which under his sons advice he was atthis moment expending 700 in rectifying the mistake which he hadmade</s>  in giving the marquis his due we must acknowledge that he caredbut little about the money</s>  marquises though they may have largeproperties are not always in possession of any number of loosehundreds which they can throw away without feeling the loss</s>  nor wasthe marquis of trowbridge so circumstanced now</s>  but that trouble didnot gall him nearly so severely as the necessity which was on him torectify an error made by himself</s>  he had done a foolish thing</s>  underno circumstances should the chapel have been built on that spot</s>  heknew it now and he knew that he must apologise</s>  noblesse oblige</s> the old lord was very stupid very wrongheaded and sometimes veryarrogant but he would not do a wrong if he knew it and nothing onearth would make him tell a wilful lie</s>  the epithet indeed might havebeen omitted for a lie is not a lie unless it be wilful</s> lord trowbridge passed the hours of this tuesday morning underthe frightful sense of the necessity for apologisingand yet heremembered well the impudence of the man how he had ventured toallude to the ladies stowte likening them tototo</s>  it wasterrible to be thought of</s>  and his lordship remembered too howthis man had written about the principal entrance to his own mansionas though it had been no more than the entrance to any other manshouse</s>  though the thorns still rankled in his own flesh he had toown that he himself had been wrong</s> and he did itwith an honesty that was beyond the reach of his muchmore clever son</s>  when the fenwicks arrived they were taken into thedrawingroom in which were sitting the ladies sophie and carolinawith various guests already assembled at the castle</s>  in a minute ortwo the marquis shuffled in and shook hands with the two new comers</s> then he shuffled about the room for another minute or two and atlast got his arm through that of the vicar and led him away into hisown sanctum</s>  mr</s>  fenwick he said i think it best to express myregret at once for two things that have occurred</s> illustration the drawingroom at turnover castle</s> it does not signify my lord</s> but it does signify to me and if you will listen to me for a momenti shall take your doing so as a favour added to that which you haveconferred upon me in coming here</s>  the vicar could only bow andlisten</s>  i am sorry mr</s>  fenwick that i should have written to thebishop of this diocese in reference to your conduct</s>  fenwick foundit very difficult to hold his tongue when this was said</s>  he imaginedthat the marquis was going to excuse himself about the chapelandabout the chapel he cared nothing at all</s>  but as to that letter tothe bishop he did feel that the less said about it the better</s>  herestrained himself however and the marquis went on</s>  things hadbeen told me mr</s>  fenwickand i thought that i was doing my duty</s> it did me no harm my lord</s> i believe not</s>  i had been misinformedand i apologise</s>  themarquis paused and the vicar bowed</s>  it is probable that the vicardid not at all know how deep at that moment were the sufferings ofthe marquis</s>  and now as to the chapel continued the marquis</s> my lord that is such a trifle that you must let me say that it isnot and has not been of the slightest consequence</s> i was misled as to that bit of ground</s> i only wish my lord that the chapel could stand there</s> that is impossible</s>  the land has been appropriated to otherpurposes and though we have all been a little in the dark aboutour own rights right must be done</s>  i will only add that i have thegreatest satisfaction in seeing you and mrs</s>  fenwick at turnover andthat i hope the satisfaction may often be repeated</s>  then he led theway back into the drawingroom and the evil hour had passed over hishead</s> upon the whole things went very well with both the vicar and hiswife during their visit</s>  he did go out shooting one day and wastreated very civilly by the turnover gamekeeper though he wasprepared with no fivepound note at the end of his days amusement</s> when he returned to the house his host congratulated him on hisperformance just as cordially as though he had been one of the laity</s> on the next day he rode over with lord st</s>  george to see the countyhunt kennels which were then at charleycoats and nobody seemed tothink him very wicked because he ventured to have an opinion abouthounds</s>  mrs</s>  fenwicks amusements were perhaps less exciting butshe went through them with equanimity</s>  she was taken to see theparish schools and was walked into the parish churchin which thestowte family were possessed of an enormous recess called a pewbut which was in truth a room with a fireplace in it</s>  mrs</s>  fenwickthought it did not look very much like a church but as the ladiesstowte were clearly very proud of it she held her peace as to thatidea</s>  and so the visit to turnover park was made and the fenwickswere driven home</s> after all theres nothing like burying the hatchet said he</s> but who sharpened the hatchet</s>  asked mrs</s>  fenwick</s> never mind who sharpened it</s>  weve buried it</s> chapter lxxiii</s> conclusion</s> there is nothing further left to be told of this story of the villageof bullhampton and its vicar beyond what may be necessary to satisfythe reader as to the condition and future prospects of the brattlefamily</s>  the writer of these pages ventures to hope that whatever mayhave been the fate in the readers mind of that couple which areabout to settle themselves peaceably at dunripple and to wait therein comfort till their own time for reigning shall have come somesympathy may have been felt with those humbler personages who havelived with orderly industry at the millas also with those wholed away by disorderly passions have strayed away from it and havecome back again to the old home</s> for a couple of days after the return of the miller with his daughterand son very little was said about the pastvery little atleast in which either the father or sam took any part</s>  between thetwo sisters there were no doubt questions and answers by the hourtogether as to every smallest detail of the occurrences at salisbury</s> and the mother almost sang hymns of joy over her child in that thehour which she had so much dreaded had passed by</s>  but the miller saidnot a wordand sam was almost equally silent</s>  but it be all oversam</s>  asked his mother anxiously one day</s>  for certain sure it beall over now</s> theres one mother for whom it aint all over yetpoor devil</s> but he was themurderer sam</s> so was tother fellow</s>  there werent no difference</s>  if one was morespry to kill told chap than tother acorn was the spryest</s>  thatswhat i think</s>  but its done now and there aint been much justice init</s>  as far as i sees there never aint much justice</s>  they was nighahanging o me and if those chaps had thought o bringing toldmans box nigh the mill instead of over by told womans cottagethey would a hung meoutright</s>  and then they was twelve monthsabout it</s>  i dont think much on em</s>  when his mother tried tocontinue the conversationwhich she would have loved to do withthat morbid interest which we always take in a matter which has beennearly fatal to us but from which we have escapedsam turned intothe mill saying that he had had enough of it and wouldnt have anymore</s> then on the third day a report of the trial in a county newspaperreached them</s>  this the miller read all through painfully from thebeginning to the end omitting no detail of the official occurrences</s> at last when he came to the account of sams evidence he got upfrom the chair on which he was sitting close to the window andstriking his fist upon the table made his first and last commentupon the trial</s>  it was well said sam</s>  yes though thou beest myown it was well said</s>  then he put the paper down and walked out ofdoors and they could see that his eyes were full of tears</s> but from that time forth there came a great change in his manner tohis youngest daughter</s>  well carry he would say to her in themorning with as much outward sign of affection as he ever showed toany one and at night when she came and stood over him before helifted his weary limbs out of his chair to take himself away to hisbed he turned his forehead to her to be kissed as he did to thatbetter daughter who had needed no forgiveness from him</s>  neverthelessthey who knew himand there were none who knew him better thanfanny didwere aware that he never for a moment forgot the disgracewhich had fallen upon his household</s>  he had forgiven the sinner butthe shame of the sin was always on him and he carried himself as aman who was bound to hide himself from the eyes of his neighboursbecause there had come upon him a misfortune which made it fit thathe should live in retirement</s> sam took up his abode in the house and worked daily in the milland for weeks nothing was said either of his going away or of hisreturn</s>  he would talk to his sisters of the manner in which he hadworked among the machinery of the durham mine at which he had foundemployment but he said nothing for awhile of the cause which hadtaken him north or of his purpose of remaining where he was</s>  he ateand drank in the house and from time to time his father paid himsmall sums as wages</s>  at last sitting one evening after the work ofthe day was done he spoke out his mind</s>  father said he imabout minded to get me a wife</s>  his mother and sisters were all thereand heard the proposition made</s> and who is the girl as is to have thee sam</s>  asked his mother</s> as sam did not answer at once carry replied for him</s>  who should itbe motherbut only agnes pope</s> it aint that un</s>  said the miller surlily</s> and why shouldnt it be that un father</s>  it is that un and noother</s>  if she be not liked here why well just go further andperhaps not fare worse</s> there was nothing to be said against poor agnes popeonly thisthat she had been in trumbulls house on the night of the murder andhad for awhile been suspected by the police of having communicatedto her lover the tidings of the farmers box of money</s>  evil thingshad of course been said of her then but the words spoken of her hadbeen proved to be untrue</s>  she had been taken from the farmers houseinto that of the vicarwho had indeed been somewhat abused bythe puddlehamites for harbouring her but as the belief in samsguilt had gradually been abandoned so of course had the grounddisappeared for supposing that poor agnes had had ought to do inbringing about the murder of her late master</s>  for two days the millerwas very gloomy and made no reply when sam declared his purpose ofleaving the mill before christmas unless agnes should be receivedthere as his wifebut at last he gave way</s>  as the old uns go intotheir graves he said its no more than nature that the young unsshould become masters</s>  and so sam was married and was taken withhis wife to live with the other brattles at the mill</s>  it was wellfor the miller that it should be so for sam was a man who wouldsurely earn money when he put his shoulder in earnest to the wheel</s> as for carry she lived still with them doomed by her beauty as washer elder sister by the want of it to expect that no lover shouldcome and ask her to establish with him a homestead of their own</s> our friend the vicar married sam and his sweetheart and is stilloften at the mill</s>  from time to time he has made
