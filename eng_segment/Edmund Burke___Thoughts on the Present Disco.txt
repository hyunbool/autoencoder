 it was directed chiefly against court influence that hadfirst been used successfully against the rockingham ministry</s>  allegianceto rockingham caused burke to write the pamphlet but he based hisargument upon essentials of his own faith as a statesman</s>  it was thebeginning of the larger utterance of his political mind</s> court influence was strengthened in those days by the large

show by what pilotage he wouldhave men weather the storm</s> h</s>  m</s> thoughts on the present discontentsit is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the causeof public disorders</s>  if a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiryhe will be thought weak and visionary if he touches the true grievancethere is a danger that he may come near to persons of weight andconsequence who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of theirerrors than thankful for the occasion of correcting them</s>  if he shouldbe obliged to blame the favourites of the people he will be consideredas the tool of power if he censures those in power he will be looked onas an instrument of faction</s>  but in all exertions of duty something isto be hazarded</s>  in cases of

may lookinto them narrowly they may reason upon them liberally and if theyshould be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischiefand to suggest any probable method of removing it though they maydisplease the rulers for the day they are certainly of service to thecause of government</s>  government is deeply interested in everythingwhich even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness may tendfinally to compose the minds of the subjects and to conciliate theiraffections</s>  i have nothing to do here with the abstract value of thevoice of the people</s>  but as long as reputation the most preciouspossession of every individual and as long as opinion the great supportof the state depend entirely upon that voice it can never be consideredas a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to government</s> nations are not primarily ruled by laws less by violence</s>  whateveroriginal energy may be supposed either in force or regulation theoperation of both is in truth merely instrumental</s>  nations aregoverned by the same methods and on the same principles by which anindividual without authority is often able to govern those who are hisequals or his superiors by a knowledge of their temper and by ajudicious management of it i mean when public affairs are steadily andquietly conducted not when government is nothing but a continued scufflebetween the magistrate and the multitude in which sometimes the one andsometimes the other is uppermostin which they alternately yield andprevail in a series of contemptible victories and scandaloussubmissions</s>  the temper of the people amongst whom he presides oughttherefore to be the first study of a statesman</s>  and the knowledge ofthis temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain if he has notan interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn</s> to complain of the age we live in to murmur at the present possessors ofpower to lament the past to conceive extravagant hopes of the futureare the common dispositions of the greater part of mankindindeed thenecessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar</s>  suchcomplaints and humours have existed in all times yet as all times havenot been alike true political sagacity manifests itself indistinguishing that complaint which only characterises the generalinfirmity of human nature

is something particularly alarming inthe present conjuncture</s>  there is hardly a man in or out of power whoholds any other language</s>  that government is at once dreaded andcontemned that the laws are despoiled of all their respected andsalutary terrors that their inaction is a subject of ridicule and theirexertion of abhorrence that rank and office and title and all thesolemn plausibilities of the world have lost their reverence and effectthat our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economythat our dependencies are slackened in their affection and loosened fromtheir obedience that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforcethat hardly anything above or below abroad or at home is sound andentire but that disconnection and confusion in

easilypervert our judgment and our minds sore from the loss of nationalglory might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in government</s>     it is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should notsometimes become a subject of discourse</s>  it is a compliment due andwhich i willingly pay to those who administer our affairs to takenotice in the first place of their speculation</s>  our ministers are ofopinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures that our growthby colonisation and by conquest have concurred to accumulate immensewealth in the hands of some individuals and this again being dispersedamongst the people has rendered them universally proud ferocious andungovernable that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth andthe boldness of others from a guilty poverty have rendered them capableof the most atrocious attempts so that they have trampled upon allsubordination and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a freegovernmentbarriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierceand licentious as ours</s>  they contend that no adequate provocation hasbeen given for so spreading a discontent our affairs having beenconducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom</s>  thewicked industry of some libellers joined to the intrigues of a fewdisappointed politicians have in their opinion been able to producethis unnatural ferment in the nation</s> nothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of thiscountry if the above account be a true one</s>  i confess i shall assent toit with great reluctance and only on the compulsion of the clearest andfirmest proofs because their account resolves itself into this short butdiscouraging proposition that we have a very good ministry but that weare a very bad people that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feedsus that with a malignant insanity we oppose the measures andungratefully vilify the persons of those whose sole object is our ownpeace and prosperity</s>  if a few puny libellers acting under a knot offactious politicians without virtue parts or character such they areconstantly represented by these gentlemen are sufficient to excite thisdisturbance very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongstwhom such a disturbance can be excited by such means</s>  it is besides nosmall aggravation of the public misfortune that the disease on thishypothesis appears to be without remedy</s>  if the wealth of the nation bethe cause of its turbulence i imagine it is not proposed to introducepoverty as a constable to keep the peace</s>  if our dominions abroad arethe roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition it is notintended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit</s>  if our libertyhas enfeebled the executive power there is no design i hope to call inthe aid of despotism to fill up the deficiencies of law</s>  whatever may beintended these things are not yet professed</s>  we seem therefore to bedriven to absolute despair for we have no other materials to work uponbut those out of which god has been pleased to form the inhabitants ofthis island</s>  if these be radically and essentially vicious all that canbe said is that those men are very unhappy to whose fortune or duty itfalls to administer the affairs of this untoward people</s>  i hear itindeed sometimes asserted that a steady perseverance in the presentmeasures and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them will incourse of time infallibly put an end to these disorders</s>  but this in myopinion is said without much observation of our present disposition andwithout any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind</s>  if thematter of which this nation is composed be so very fermentable as thesegentlemen describe it leaven never will be wanting to work it up aslong as discontent revenge and ambition have existence in the world</s> particular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in thestate they inflame rather than allay those heats which arise from thesettled mismanagement of the government or from a natural illdisposition in the people</s>  it is of the utmost moment not to makemistakes in the use of strong measures and firmness is then only avirtue when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom</s>  in truthinconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance</s> i am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong</s> they have been so frequently and outrageously both in other countriesand in this</s>  but i do say that in all disputes between them and theirrulers the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people</s> experience may perhaps justify me in going further</s>  when populardiscontents have been very prevalent it may well be affirmed andsupported that there has been generally something found amiss in theconstitution or in the conduct of government</s>  the people have nointerest in disorder</s>  when they do wrong it is their error and nottheir crime</s>  but with the governing part of the state it is farotherwise</s>  they certainly may act ill by design as

more probable i am sure it is the more comfortable speculationbecause it is more easy to change an administration than to reform apeople</s>     upon a supposition therefore that in the opening of the cause thepresumptions stand equally balanced between the parties there seemssufficient ground to entitle any person to a fair hearing who attemptssome other scheme besides that easy one which is fashionable in somefashionable companies to account for the present discontents</s>  it is notto be argued that we endure no grievance because our grievances are notof the same sort with those under which we laboured formerlynotprecisely those which we bore from the tudors or vindicated on thestuarts</s>  a great change has taken place in the affairs of this country</s> for in the silent lapse of events as material alterations have beeninsensibly brought about in the policy and character of governments andnations as those which have been marked by the tumult of publicrevolutions</s> it is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerningpublic misconduct as rare to be right in their speculation upon thecause of it</s>  i have constantly observed that the generality of peopleare fifty years at least behindhand in their politics</s>  there are butvery few who are capable of comparing and digesting what passes beforetheir eyes at different times and occasions so as to form the whole intoa distinct system</s>  but in books everything is settled for them withoutthe exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity</s>  for which reasonmen are wise with but little reflection and good with littleselfdenial in the business of all times except their own</s>  we are veryuncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of pastages where no passions deceive and where the whole train ofcircumstances from the trifling cause to the tragical event is set inan orderly series before us</s>  few are the partisans of departed tyrannyand to be a whig on the business of a hundred years ago is veryconsistent with every advantage of present servility</s>  this retrospectivewisdom and historical patriotism are things of wonderful convenience andserve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between speculation andpractice</s>  many a stern republican after gorging himself with a fullfeast of admiration of the grecian commonwealths and of our true saxonconstitution and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuousindignation on king john and king james sits down perfectly satisfied tothe coarsest work and homeliest job of the day he lives in</s>  i believethere was no professed admirer of henry the eighth among the instrumentsof the last king james nor in the court of henry the eighth was there idare say to be found a single advocate for the favourites of richard thesecond</s> no complaisance to our court or to our age can make me believe natureto be so changed but that public liberty will be among us as among ourancestors obnoxious to some person or other and that opportunities willbe furnished for attempting at least some alteration to the prejudiceof our constitution</s>  these attempts will naturally vary in their modeaccording to times and circumstances</s>  for ambition though it has everthe same general views has not at all times the same means nor the sameparticular objects</s>  a great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny isworn to rags the rest is entirely out of fashion</s>  besides there arefew statesmen so very clumsy and awkward in their business as to fallinto the identical snare which has proved fatal to their predecessors</s> when an arbitrary imposition is attempted upon the subject undoubtedlyit will not bear on its forehead the name of shipmoney</s>  there is nodanger that an extension of the forest laws should be the chosen modeof oppression in this age</s>  and when we hear any instance of ministerialrapacity to the prejudice of the rights of private life it willcertainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets from a woman offashion for leave to lie with her own husband</s> every age has its own manners and its politics dependent upon them andthe same attempts will not be made against a constitution fully formedand matured that were used to destroy it in the cradle or to resist itsgrowth during its infancy</s> against the being of parliament i am satisfied no designs have everbeen entertained since the revolution</s>  every one must perceive that itis strongly the interest of the court to have some second causeinterposed between the ministers and the people</s>  the gentlemen of thehouse of commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the partof that intermediate cause</s>  however they may hire out the usufruct oftheir voices they never will part with the fee and inheritance</s> accordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the willand pleasure of a court have at the same time been most forward inasserting a high authority in the house of commons</s>  when they knew whowere to use that authority and how it was to be employed they thoughtit never could be carried too far</s>  it must be always the wish of anunconstitutional statesman that a house of commons who are entirelydependent upon him should have every right of the people entirelydependent upon their pleasure</s>  it was soon discovered that the forms ofa free and the ends of an arbitrary government were things notaltogether incompatible</s> the power of the crown almost dead and rotten as prerogative has grownup anew with much more strength and far less odium under the name ofinfluence</s>  an influence which operated without noise and withoutviolence an influence which converted the very antagonist into theinstrument of power which contained in itself a perpetual principle ofgrowth and renovation and which the distresses and the prosperity of thecountry equally tended to augment was an admirable substitute for aprerogative that being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices hadmoulded in its original stamina irresistible principles of decay anddissolution</s>  the ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporarysystem the interest of active men in the state is a foundation perpetualand infallible</s>  however some circumstances arising it must beconfessed in a great degree from accident prevented the effects of thisinfluence for a long time from breaking out in a manner capable ofexciting any serious apprehensions</s>  although government was strong andflourished exceedingly the court had drawn far less advantage than onewould imagine from this great source of power</s>     at the revolution the crown deprived for the ends of the revolutionitself of many prerogatives was found too weak to struggle against allthe difficulties which pressed so new and unsettled a government</s>  thecourt was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men ofsuch interest as could support and of such fidelity as would adhere toits establishment</s>  such men were able to draw in a greater number to aconcurrence in the common defence</s>  this connection necessary at firstcontinued long after convenient and properly conducted might indeed inall situations be a useful instrument of government</s>  at the same timethrough the intervention of men of popular weight and character thepeople possessed a security for their just proportion of importance inthe state</s>  but as the title to the crown grew stronger by longpossession and by the constant increase of its influence these helpshave of late seemed to certain persons no better than incumbrances</s>  thepowerful managers for government were not sufficiently submissive to thepleasure of the possessors of immediate and personal favour sometimesfrom a confidence in their own strength natural and acquired sometimesfrom a fear of offending their friends and weakening that lead in thecountry which gave them a consideration independent of the court</s>  menacted as if the court could receive as well as confer an obligation</s> the influence of government thus divided in appearance between the courtand the leaders of parties became in many cases an accession rather tothe popular than to the royal scale and some part of that influencewhich would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of mortmain andunalienable domain returned again to the great ocean from whence itarose and circulated among the people</s>  this method therefore ofgoverning by men of great natural interest or great acquiredconsideration was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers ofabsolute monarchy</s>  it is the nature of despotism to abhor power held byany means but its own momentary pleasure and to annihilate allintermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part andtotal debility on the part of the people</s> to get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance and tosecure to the court the unlimited and uncontrolled use of its own vastinfluence under the sole direction of its own private favour has forsome years past been the great object of policy</s>  if this were compassedthe influence of the crown must of course produce all the effects whichthe most sanguine partisans of the court could possibly desire</s> government might then be carried on without any concurrence on the partof the people without any attention to the dignity of the greater or tothe affections of the lower sorts</s>  a new project was therefore devisedby a certain set of intriguing men totally different from the system ofadministration which had prevailed since the accession of the house ofbrunswick</s>  this project i have heard was first conceived by somepersons in the court of frederick prince of wales</s> the earliest attempt in the execution of this design was to set up forminister a person in rank indeed respectable and very ample in fortunebut who to the moment of this vast and sudden elevation was littleknown or considered in the kingdom</s>  to him the whole nation was to yieldan immediate and implicit submission</s>  but whether it was from want offirmness to bear up against the first opposition or that things were notyet fully ripened or that this method was not found the most eligiblethat idea was soon abandoned</s>  the instrumental part of the project was alittle altered to accommodate it to the time and to bring things moregradually and more surely to the one great end proposed</s> the first part of the reformed plan was to draw a line which shouldseparate the court from the ministry</s>  hitherto these names had beenlooked upon as synonymous but for the future court and administrationwere to be considered as things totally distinct</s>  by this operation twosystems of administration were to be formed one which should be in thereal secret and confidence the other merely ostensible to perform theofficial and executory duties of government</s>  the latter were alone to beresponsible whilst the real advisers who enjoyed all the power wereeffectually removed from all the danger</s> secondly a party under these leaders was to be formed in favour of thecourt against the ministry this party was to have a large share in theemoluments of government and to hold it totally separate from andindependent of ostensible administration</s> the third point and that on which the success of the whole schemeultimately depended was to bring parliament to an acquiescence in thisproject</s>  parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a totalindifference to the persons rank influence abilities connections andcharacter of the ministers of the crown</s>  by means of a discipline onwhich i shall say more hereafter that body was to be habituated to themost opposite interests and the most discordant politics</s>  allconnections and dependencies among subjects were to be entirelydissolved</s>  as hitherto business had gone through the hands of leaders ofwhigs or tories men of talents to conciliate the people and to engagetheir confidence now the method was to be altered and the lead was tobe given to men of no sort of consideration or credit in the country</s> this want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegatedpower</s>  members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibilityto pride as well as to duty</s>  those high and haughty sentiments whichare the great support of independence were to be let down gradually</s> point of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded inparliamentary decorum than in a turkish army</s>  it was to be avowed as aconstitutional maxim that the king might appoint one of his footmen orone of your footmen for minister and that he ought to be and that hewould be as well followed as the first name for rank or wisdom in thenation</s>  thus parliament was to look on as if perfectly unconcernedwhile a cabal of the closet and backstairs was substituted in the placeof a national administration</s> with such a degree of acquiescence any measure of any court might wellbe deemed thoroughly secure</s>  the capital objects and by much the mostflattering characteristics of arbitrary power would be obtained</s> everything would be drawn from its holdings in the country to thepersonal favour and inclination of the prince</s>  this favour would be thesole introduction to power and the only tenure by which it was to beheld so that no person looking towards another and all looking towardsthe court it was impossible but that the motive which solely influencedevery mans hopes must come in time to govern every mans conduct tillat last the servility became universal in spite of the dead letter ofany laws or institutions whatsoever</s> how it should happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon such aproject of government may at first view appear surprising</s>  but the factis that opportunities very inviting to such an attempt have offered andthe scheme itself was not destitute of some arguments not whollyunplausible to recommend it</s>  these opportunities and these argumentsthe use that has been made of both the plan for carrying this new schemeof government into execution and the effects which it has produced arein my opinion worthy of our serious consideration</s> his majesty came to the throne of these kingdoms with more advantagesthan any of his predecessors since the revolution</s>  fourth in descentand third in succession of his royal family even the zealots ofhereditary right in him saw something to flatter their favouriteprejudices and to justify a transfer of their attachments without achange in their principles</s>  the person and cause of the pretender werebecome contemptible his title disowned throughout europe his partydisbanded in england</s>  his majesty came indeed to the inheritance of amighty war but victorious in every part of the globe peace was alwaysin his power not to negotiate but to dictate</s>  no foreign habitudes orattachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home</s>  hisrevenue for the civil establishment fixed as it was then thought at alarge but definite sum was ample without being invidious hisinfluence by additions from conquest by an augmentation of debt by anincrease of military and naval establishment much strengthened andextended</s>  and coming to the throne in the prime and full vigour ofyouth as from affection there was a strong dislike so from dread thereseemed to be a general averseness from giving anything like offence to amonarch against whose resentment opposition could not look for a refugein any sort of reversionary hope</s> these singular advantages inspired his majesty only with a more ardentdesire to preserve unimpaired the spirit of that national freedom towhich he owed a situation so full of glory</s>  but to others it suggestedsentiments of a very different nature</s>  they thought they now beheld anopportunity by a certain sort of statesman never long undiscovered orunemployed of drawing to themselves by the aggrandisement of a courtfaction a degree of power which they could never hope to derive fromnatural influence or from honourable service and which it was impossiblethey could hold with the least security whilst the system ofadministration rested upon its former bottom</s>  in order to facilitate theexecution of their design it was necessary to make many alterations inpolitical arrangement and a signal change in the opinions habits andconnections of the greater part of those who at that time acted inpublic</s> in the first place they proceeded gradually but not slowly to destroyeverything of strength which did not derive its principal nourishmentfrom the immediate pleasure of the court</s>  the greatest weight of popularopinion and party connection were then with the duke of newcastle and mr</s> pitt</s>  neither of these held his importance by the new tenure of thecourt they were not therefore thought to be so proper as others forthe services which were required by that tenure</s>  it happened veryfavourably for the new system that under a forced coalition thererankled an incurable alienation and disgust between the parties whichcomposed the administration</s>  mr</s>  pitt was first attacked</s>  not satisfiedwith removing him from power they endeavoured by various artifices toruin his character</s>  the other party seemed rather pleased to get rid ofso oppressive a support not perceiving that their own fall was preparedby his and involved in it</s>  many other reasons prevented them fromdaring to look their true situation in the face</s>  to the great whigfamilies it was extremely disagreeable and seemed almost unnatural tooppose the administration of a prince of the house of brunswick</s>  dayafter day they hesitated and doubted and lingered expecting that othercounsels would take place and were slow to be persuaded that all whichhad been done by the cabal was the effect not of humour but of system</s> it was more strongly and evidently the interest of the new court factionto get rid of the great whig connections than to destroy mr</s>  pitt</s>  thepower of that gentleman was vast indeed and merited but it was in agreat degree personal and therefore transient</s>  theirs was rooted in thecountry</s>  for with a good deal less of popularity they possessed a farmore natural and fixed influence</s>  long possession of government vastproperty obligations of favours given and received connection ofoffice ties of blood of alliance of friendship things at that timesupposed of some force the name of whig dear to the majority of thepeople the zeal early begun and steadily continued to the royal familyall these together formed a body of power in the nation which wascriminal and devoted</s>  the great ruling principle of the cabal and thatwhich animated and harmonised all their proceedings how various soeverthey may have been was to signify to the world that the court wouldproceed upon its own proper forces only and that the pretence ofbringing any other into its service was an affront to it and not asupport</s>  therefore when the chiefs were removed in order to go to theroot the whole party was put under a proscription so general and severeas to take their hardearned bread from the lowest officers in a mannerwhich had never been known before even in general revolutions</s>  but itwas thought necessary effectually to destroy all dependencies but oneand to show an example of the firmness and rigour with which the newsystem was to be supported</s> thus for the time were pulled down in the persons of the whig leadersand of mr</s>  pitt in spite of the services of the one at the accession ofthe royal family and the recent services of the other in the war thetwo only securities for the importance of the people power arisingfrom popularity and power arising from connection</s>  here and thereindeed a few individuals were left standing who gave security for theirtotal estrangement from the odious principles of party connection andpersonal attachment and it must be confessed that most of them havereligiously kept their faith</s>  such a change could not however be madewithout a mighty shock to government</s> to reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements

the personal consideration of lord butewholly out of the question</s>  he communicates very little in a directmanner with the greater part of our men of business</s>  this has never beenhis custom</s>  it is enough for him that he surrounds them with hiscreatures</s>  several imagine therefore that they have a very good excusefor doing all the work of this faction when they have no personalconnection with lord bute</s>  but whoever becomes a party to anadministration composed of insulated individuals without faithplighted tie or common principle an administration

shortly as i am able the effects of this systemon our foreign affairs on the policy of our government with regard toour dependencies and on the interior economy of the commonwealth thereremains only in this part of my design to say something of the grandprinciple which first recommended this system at court</s>  the pretence wasto prevent the king from being enslaved by a faction and made a prisonerin his closet</s>  this scheme might have been expected to answer at leastits own end and to indemnify the king in his personal capacity for allthe confusion into which it has thrown his government</s>  but has it inreality answered this purpose</s>  i am sure if it had every affectionatesubject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evilswhich attend it</s> in order to come at the truth in this matter it may not be amiss toconsider it somewhat in detail</s>  i speak here of the king and not of thecrown the interests of which we have already touched</s>  independent ofthat greatness which a king possesses merely by being a representative ofthe national dignity the things in which he may have an individualinterest seem to be these wealth accumulated wealth spent inmagnificence pleasure or beneficence personal respect and attentionand above all private ease and repose of mind</s>  these compose theinventory of prosperous circumstances whether they regard a prince or asubject their enjoyments differing only in the scale upon which they areformed</s> suppose then we were to ask whether the king has been richer than hispredecessors in accumulated wealth since the establishment of the planof favouritism</s>  i believe it will be found that the picture of royalindigence which our court has presented until this year has been trulyhumiliating</s>  nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress butby means which have hazarded the affection of the people and shakentheir confidence in parliament</s>  if the public treasures had beenexhausted in magnificence and splendour this distress would have beenaccounted for and in some measure justified</s>  nothing would be moreunworthy of this nation than with a mean and mechanical rule to meteout the splendour of the crown</s>  indeed i have found very few personsdisposed to so ungenerous a procedure</s>  but the generality of people itmust be confessed do feel a good deal mortified when they compare thewants of the court with its expenses</s>  they do not behold the cause ofthis distress in any part of the apparatus of royal magnificence</s>  in allthis they see nothing but the operations of parsimony attended with allthe consequences of profusion</s>  nothing expended nothing saved</s>  theirwonder is increased by their knowledge that besides the revenue settledon his majestys civil list to the amount of 800000 pounds a year hehas a farther aid from a large pension list near 90000 pounds a yearin ireland from the produce of the duchy of lancaster which we are toldhas been greatly improved from the revenue of the duchy of cornwallfrom the american quitrents from the four and a half per cent</s>
 the whole is certainly not much short of a millionannually</s> these are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our nationalcouncils</s>  we have no direct right to examine into the receipts from hismajestys german dominions and the bishopric of osnaburg</s>  this isunquestionably true</s>  but that which is not within the province ofparliament is yet within the sphere of every mans own reflection</s>  if aforeign prince resided amongst us the state of his revenues could notfail of becoming the subject of our speculation</s>  filled with an anxiousconcern for whatever regards the welfare of our sovereign it isimpossible in considering the miserable circumstances into which he hasbeen brought that this obvious topic should be entirely passed over</s> there is an opinion universal that these revenues produce something notinconsiderable clear of all charges and establishments</s>  this producethe people do not believe to be hoarded nor perceive to be spent</s>  it isaccounted for in the only manner it can by supposing that it is drawnaway for the support of that court faction which whilst it distressesthe nation impoverishes the prince in every one of his resources</s>  ionce more caution the reader that i do not urge this considerationconcerning the foreign revenue as if i supposed we had a direct right toexamine into the expenditure of any part of it but solely for thepurpose of showing how little this system of favouritism has beenadvantageous to the monarch himself which without magnificence hassunk him into a state of unnatural poverty at the same time that hepossessed every means of affluence from ample revenues both in thiscountry and in other parts of his dominions</s> has this system provided better for the treatment becoming his high andsacred character and secured the king from those disgusts attached tothe necessity of employing men who are not personally agreeable</s>  this isa topic upon which for many reasons i could wish to be silent but thepretence of securing against such causes of uneasiness is the cornerstone of the court party</s>  it has however so happened that if i were tofix upon any one point in which this system has been more particularlyand shamefully blameable the effects which it has produced would justifyme in choosing for that point its tendency to degrade the personaldignity of the sovereign and to expose him to a thousand contradictionsand mortifications</s>  it is but too evident in what manner theseprojectors of royal greatness have fulfilled all their magnificentpromises</s>  without recapitulating all the circumstances of the reignevery one of which is more or less a melancholy proof of the truth ofwhat i have advanced let us consider the language of the court but a fewyears ago concerning most of the persons now in the externaladministration let me ask whether any enemy to the personal feelings ofthe sovereign could possibly contrive a keener instrument ofmortification and degradation of all dignity than almost every part andmember of the present arrangement</s>  nor in the whole course of ourhistory has any compliance with the will of the people ever been knownto extort from any prince a greater contradiction to all his own declaredaffections and dislikes than that which is now adopted in directopposition to every thing the people approve and desire</s> an opinion prevails that greatness has been more than once advised tosubmit to certain condescensions towards individuals which have beendenied to the entreaties of a nation</s>  for the meanest and most dependentinstrument of this system knows that there are hours when its existencemay depend upon his adherence to it and he takes his advantageaccordingly</s>  indeed it is a law of nature that whoever is necessary towhat we have made our object is sure in some way or in some time orother to become our master</s>  all this however is submitted to in orderto avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinionof the people</s>  for it seems to be laid down as a maxim that a king hassome sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects that all whoare pleasing to them are to be of course disagreeable to him that assoon as the persons who are odious at court are known to be odious to thepeople it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon themall kinds of emoluments and honours</s>  none are considered as wellwishersto the crown but those who advised to some unpopular course of actionnone capable of serving it but those who are obliged to call at everyinstant upon all its power for the safety of their lives</s>  none aresupposed to be fit priests in the temple of government but the personswho are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary</s>  such is the effect ofthis refined project such is ever the result of all the contrivanceswhich are used to free men from the servitude of their reason and fromthe necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evidentinterests</s>  these contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinousservitude in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attendedwith advantage</s> if therefore this system has so ill answered its own grand pretence ofsaving the king from the necessity of employing persons disagreeable tohim has it given more peace and tranquillity to his majestys privatehours</s>  no most certainly</s>  the father of his people cannot possiblyenjoy repose while his family is in such a state of distraction</s>  thenwhat has the crown or the king profited by all this finewrought scheme</s> is he more rich or more splendid or more powerful or more at his easeby so many labours and contrivances</s>  have they not beggared hisexchequer tarnished the splendour of his court sunk his dignity galledhis feelings discomposed the whole order and happiness of his privatelife</s> it will be very hard i believe to state in what respect the king hasprofited by that faction which presumptuously choose to call themselveshis friends</s> if particular men had grown into an attachment by the distinguishedhonour of the society of their sovereign and by being the partakers ofhis amusements came sometimes to prefer the gratification of hispersonal inclinations to the support of his high character the thingwould be very natural and it would be excusable enough</s>
 they are only known to their sovereign bykissing his hand for the offices pensions and grants into which theyhave deceived his benignity</s>  may no storm ever come which will put thefirmness of their attachment to the proof and which in the midst ofconfusions and terrors and sufferings may demonstrate the eternaldifference between a true and severe friend to the monarchy and aslippery sycophant of the court quantum infido scurrae distabitamicus</s>     so far i have considered the effect of the court system chiefly as itoperates upon the executive government on the temper of the people andon the happiness of the sovereign</s>  it remains that we should considerwith a little attention its operation upon parliament</s> parliament was indeed the great object of all these politics the end atwhich they aimed as well as the instrument by which they were tooperate</s>  but before parliament could be made subservient to a systemby which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national councilinto a mere member of the court it must be greatly changed from itsoriginal character</s> in speaking of this body i have my eye chiefly on the house of commons</s> i hope i shall be indulged in a few observations on the nature andcharacter of that assembly not with regard to its legal form andpower but to its spirit and to the purposes it is meant to answer inthe constitution</s> the house of commons was supposed originally to be no part of thestanding government of this country</s>  it was considered as a controlissuing immediately from the people and speedily to be resolved into themass from whence it arose</s>  in this respect it was in the higher part ofgovernment what juries are in the lower</s>  the capacity of a magistratebeing transitory and that of a citizen permanent the latter capacity itwas hoped would of course preponderate in all discussions not onlybetween the people and the standing authority of the crown but betweenthe people and the fleeting authority of the house of commons itself</s>  itwas hoped that being of a middle nature between subject and governmentthey would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest everything thatconcerned the people than the other remoter and more permanent parts oflegislature</s> whatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business mayhave introduced this character can never be sustained unless the houseof commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition ofthe people at large</s>  it would among public misfortunes be an evil morenatural and tolerable that the house of commons should be infected withevery epidemical frenzy of the people as this would indicate someconsanguinity some sympathy of nature with their constituents than thatthey should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelingsof the people out of doors</s>  by this want of sympathy they would cease tobe a house of commons</s>  for it is not the derivation of the power of thathouse from the people which makes it in a distinct sense theirrepresentative</s>  the king is the representative of the people so are thelords so are the judges</s>  they all are trustees for the people as wellas the commons because no power is given for the sole sake of theholder and although government certainly is an institution of divineauthority yet its forms and the persons who administer it alloriginate from the people</s> a popular origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction ofa popular representative</s>  this belongs equally to all parts ofgovernment and in all forms</s>  the virtue spirit and essence of a houseof commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of thenation</s>  it was not instituted to be a control upon the people as oflate it has been taught by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency</s> it was designed as a control for the people</s>  other institutions havebeen formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses and they are iapprehend fully adequate to their object</s>  if not they ought to be madeso</s>  the house of commons as it was never intended for the support ofpeace and subordination is miserably appointed for that service havingno stronger weapon than its mace and no better officer than its serjeantatarms which it can command of its own proper authority</s>  a vigilantand jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy an anxious careof public money an openness approaching towards facility to publiccomplaint these seem to be the true characteristics of a house ofcommons</s>  but an addressing house of commons and a petitioning nation ahouse of commons full of confidence when the nation is plunged indespair in the utmost harmony with ministers whom the people regardwith the utmost abhorrence who vote thanks when the public opinioncalls upon them for impeachments who are eager to grant when thegeneral voice demands account who in all disputes between the peopleand administration presume against the people who punish theirdisorder but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them thisis an unnatural a monstrous state of things in this constitution</s>  suchan assembly may be a great wise awful senate but it is not to anypopular purpose a house of commons</s>  this change from an immediate stateof procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from originalpower is the way in which all the popular magistracies in the world havebeen perverted from their purposes</s>  it is indeed their greatest andsometimes their incurable corruption</s>  for there is a materialdistinction between that corruption by which particular points arecarried against reason this is a thing which cannot be prevented byhuman wisdom and is of less consequence and the corruption of theprinciple itself</s>  for then the evil is not accidental but settled</s>  thedistemper becomes the natural habit</s> for my part i shall be compelled to conclude the principle of parliamentto be totally corrupted and therefore its ends entirely defeated when isee two symptoms first a rule of indiscriminate support to allministers because this destroys the very end of parliament as a controland is a general previous sanction to misgovernment and secondly thesetting up any claims adverse to the right of free election for thistends to subvert the legal authority by which the house of commons sits</s> i know that since the revolution along with many dangerous many usefulpowers of government have been weakened</s>  it is absolutely necessary tohave frequent recourse to the legislature</s>
 the dreadful disordersof frequent elections have also necessitated a septennial instead of atriennial duration</s>  these circumstances i mean the constant habit ofauthority and the infrequency of elections have tended very much todraw the house of commons towards the character of a standing senate</s>  itis a disorder which has arisen from the cure of greater disorders it hasarisen from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under amonarchical government with external strength and with internaltranquillity</s> it is very clear that we cannot free ourselves entirely from this greatinconvenience but i would not increase an evil because i was not ableto remove it and because it was not in my power to keep the house ofcommons religiously true to its first principles i would not argue forcarrying it to a total oblivion of them</s>  this has been the great schemeof power in our time</s>  they who will not conform their conduct to thepublic good and cannot support it by the prerogative of the crown haveadopted a new plan</s>  they have totally abandoned the shattered and oldfashioned fortress of prerogative and made a lodgment in the strongholdof parliament itself</s>  if they have any evil design to which there is noordinary legal power commensurate they bring it into parliament</s>  inparliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end</s>  inparliament the power of obtaining their object is absolute and thesafety in the proceeding perfect no rules to confine no afterreckonings to terrify</s>  parliament cannot with any great propriety punishothers for things in which they themselves have been accomplices</s>  thusthe control of parliament upon the executory power is lost becauseparliament is made to partake in every considerable act of government</s> impeachment that great guardian of the purity of the constitutionis in danger of being lost even to the idea of it</s> by this plan several important ends are answered to the cabal</s>  if theauthority of parliament supports itself the credit of every act ofgovernment which they contrive is saved but if the act be so veryodious that the whole strength of parliament is insufficient to recommendit then parliament is itself discredited and this discredit increasesmore and more that indifference to the constitution which it is theconstant aim of its enemies by their abuse of parliamentary powers torender general among the people</s>  whenever parliament is persuaded toassume the offices of executive government it will lose all theconfidence love and veneration which it has ever enjoyed whilst it wassupposed the corrective and control of the acting powers of thestate</s>  this would be the event though its conduct in such a perversionof its functions should be tolerably just and moderate but if it shouldbe iniquitous violent full of passion and full of faction it would beconsidered as the most intolerable of all the modes of tyranny</s> for a considerable time this separation of the representatives from theirconstituents went on with a silent progress and had those who conductedthe plan for their total separation been persons of temper and abilitiesany way equal to the magnitude of their design the success would havebeen infallible but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in allits nakedness the nation is alarmed at it and the event may not bepleasant to the contrivers of the scheme</s>  in the last session the corpscalled the kings friends made a hardy attempt all at once to alterthe right of election itself to put it into the power of the house ofcommons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting inparliament without any other rule than their own pleasure to makeincapacities either general for descriptions of men or particular forindividuals and to take into their body persons who avowedly had neverbeen chosen by the majority of legal electors nor agreeably to any knownrule of law</s> the arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated are not mybusiness here</s>  never has a subject been more amply and more learnedlyhandled nor upon one side in my opinion more satisfactorily they whoare not convinced by what is already written would not receive convictionthough one arose from the dead</s> i too have thought on this subject but my purpose here is only toconsider it as a part of the favourite project of government to observeon the motives which led to it and to trace its political consequences</s> a violent rage for the punishment of mr</s>  wilkes was the pretence of thewhole</s>  this gentleman by setting himself strongly in opposition to thecourt cabal had become at once an object of their persecution and ofthe popular favour</s>  the hatred of the court party pursuing and thecountenance of the people protecting him it very soon became not at alla question on the man but a trial of strength between the two parties</s> the advantage of the victory in this particular contest was the presentbut not the only nor by any means the principal object</s>  its operationupon the character of the house of commons was the great point in view</s> the point to be gained by the cabal was this that a precedent should beestablished tending to show that the favour of the people was not sosure a road as the favour of the court even to popular honours andpopular trusts</s>  a strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawlesspower a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm aninquisitive character to discover and a bold one to display

disposition a dispositionto think charitably of all the actions of men in power and to live in amutual intercourse of favours with them an inclination rather tocountenance a strong use of authority than to bear any sort oflicentiousness on the part of the people these are unfavourablequalities in an open election for members of parliament</s> the instinct which carries the people towards the choice of the formeris justified by reason because a man of such a character even in itsexorbitancies does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust theend of which is a control on power</s>  the latter character even when itis not in its extreme will execute this trust but very imperfectly andif deviating to the least excess will certainly frustrate instead offorwarding the purposes of a control on government</s>  but when the houseof commons was to be new modelled this principle was not only to bechanged but reversed</s>  whist any errors committed in support of powerwere left to the law with every advantage of favourable construction ofmitigation and finally of pardon all excesses on the side of libertyor in pursuit of popular favour or in defence of popular rights andprivileges

and holding those honours which ought tobe in the disposal of the people</s> it signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away</s>  examplethe only argument of effect in civil life demonstrates the truth of myproposition</s>  nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicioustendency of this example until i see some man for his indiscretion inthe support of power for his

country are for the most part constitutedand wisely so for the general ends of government rather than for thepreservation of our particular liberties</s>  whatever therefore is done insupport of liberty by persons not in public trust or not acting merelyin that trust is liable to be more or less out of the ordinary course ofthe law and the law itself is sufficient to animadvert upon it

and do not desire this kind intervention of the house ofcommons to free them from the burthen</s>  they are certainly in the right</s> they ought not to trust the house of commons with a power over theirfranchises because the constitution which placed two other coordinatepowers to control it reposed no such confidence in that body</s>  it were afolly well deserving servitude for its punishment to be full ofconfidence where the laws are full of distrust and to give to an houseof commons arrogating to its sole resolution the most harsh and odiouspart of legislative authority that degree of submission which is dueonly to the legislature itself</s> when the house of commons in an endeavour to obtain new advantages atthe expense of the other orders of the state for the benefits of thecommons at large have pursued strong measures if it were not just itwas at least natural that the constituents should connive at all theirproceedings because we were ourselves ultimately to profit</s>  but whenthis submission is urged to us in a contest between the representativesand ourselves and where nothing can be put into their scale which is nottaken from ours they fancy us to be children when they tell us they areour representatives our own flesh and blood and that all the stripesthey give us are for our good</s>  the very desire of that body to have sucha trust contrary to

their own body have always abused it and i see no particular sanctityin our times that is at all likely by a miraculous operation tooverrule the course of nature</s> but we must purposely shut our eyes if we consider this matter merely asa contest between the house of commons and the electors</s>  the truecontest is between the electors of the kingdom and the crown the crownacting by an instrumental house of commons</s>  it is precisely the samewhether the ministers of the crown can disqualify by a dependent house ofcommons or by a dependent court of star chamber or by a dependentcourt of kings bench</s>  if once members of parliament can be practicallyconvinced that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of thepeople for their political being they will give themselves over withouteven an appearance of reserve to the influence of the court</s> indeed a parliament unconnected with the people is essential to aministry unconnected with the people and therefore those who saw throughwhat mighty difficulties the interior ministry waded and the exteriorwere dragged in this business will conceive of what prodigiousimportance the new corps of kings men held this principle ofoccasional and personal incapacitation to the whole body of theirdesign</s> when the house of commons was thus made to consider itself as the masterof its constituents there wanted but one thing to secure that houseagainst all possible future deviation towards popularity an unlimitedfund of money to be laid out according to the pleasure of the court</s>     to complete the scheme of bringing our court to a resemblance to theneighbouring monarchies it was necessary in effect to destroy thoseappropriations of revenue which seem to limit the property as the otherlaws had done the powers of the crown</s>  an opportunity for this purposewas taken upon an application to parliament for payment of the debts ofthe civil list which in 1769 had amounted to 513000 pounds</s>  suchapplication had been made upon former occasions but to do it in theformer manner would by no means answer the present purpose</s> whenever the crown had come to the commons to desire a supply for thedischarging of debts due on the civil list it was always asked andgranted with one of the three following qualifications sometimes withall of them</s>  either it was stated that the revenue had been divertedfrom its purposes by parliament or that those duties had fallen short ofthe sum for which they were given by parliament and that the intentionof the legislature had not been fulfilled or that the money required todischarge the civil list debt was to be raised chargeable on the civillist duties</s>  in the reign of queen anne the crown was found in debt</s> the lessening and granting away some part of her revenue by parliamentwas alleged as the cause of that debt and pleaded as an equitable groundsuch it certainly was for discharging it</s>
 it does not appear that theduties which wore then applied to the ordinary government produced clearabove 580000 pounds a year because when they were afterwards grantedto george the first 120000 pounds was added to complete the whole to700000 pounds a year</s>  indeed it was then asserted and i have nodoubt truly that for many years the nett produce did not amount toabove 550000 pounds</s>
 the queens extraordinary charges were besidesvery considerable equal at least to any we have known in our time</s>  theapplication to parliament was not for an absolute grant of money but toempower the queen to raise it by borrowing upon the civil list funds</s> the civil list debt was twice paid in the reign of george the first</s>  themoney was granted upon the same plan which had been followed in the reignof queen anne</s>  the civil list revenues were then mortgaged for the sumto be raised and stood charged with the ransom of their own deliverance</s> george the second received an addition to his civil list</s>
 duties weregranted for the purpose of raising 800000 pounds a year</s>  it was notuntil he had reigned nineteen years and after the last rebellion thathe called upon parliament for a discharge of the civil list debt</s>  theextraordinary charges brought on by the rebellion account fully for thenecessities of the crown</s>  however the extraordinary charges ofgovernment were not thought a ground fit to be relied on</s>  a deficiencyof the civil list duties for several years before was stated as theprincipal if not the sole ground on which an application to parliamentcould be justified</s>  about this time the produce of these duties hadfallen pretty low and even upon an average of the whole reign they neverproduced 800000 pounds a year clear to the treasury</s>
that prince reigned fourteen years afterwards not only no new demandswere made but with so much good order were his revenues and expensesregulated that although many parts of the establishment of the courtwere upon a larger and more liberal scale than they have been sincethere was a considerable sum in hand on his decease amounting to about170000 pounds applicable to the service of the civil list of hispresent majesty</s>  so that if this reign commenced with a greater chargethan usual there was enough and more than enough abundantly to supplyall the extraordinary expense</s>  that the civil list should have beenexceeded in the two former reigns especially in the reign of george thefirst was not at all surprising</s>  his revenue was but 700000 poundsannually if it ever produced so much clear</s>  the prodigious anddangerous disaffection to the very being of the establishment and thecause of a pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad produced manydemands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home</s>  muchmanagement and great expenses were necessary</s>  but the throne of noprince has stood upon more unshaken foundations than that of his presentmajesty</s> to have exceeded the sum given for the civil list and to have incurred adebt without special authority of parliament was prima facie acriminal act as such ministers ought naturally rather to have withdrawnit from the inspection than to have exposed it to the scrutiny ofparliament</s>  certainly they ought of themselves officially to have comearmed with every sort of argument which by explaining could excuse amatter in itself of presumptive guilt</s>  but the terrors of the house ofcommons are no longer for ministers</s> on the other hand the peculiar character of the house of commons astrustee of the public purse would have led them to call with apunctilious solicitude for every public account and to have examinedinto them with the most rigorous accuracy</s> the capital use of an account is that the reality of the charge thereason of incurring it and the justice and necessity of discharging itshould all appear antecedent to the payment</s>  no man ever pays first andcalls for his account afterwards because he would thereby let out of hishands the principal and indeed only effectual means of compelling afull and fair one</s>  but in national business there is an additionalreason for a previous production of every account</s>  it is a cheekperhaps the only one upon a corrupt and prodigal use of public money</s>  anaccount after payment is to no rational purpose an account</s>  however thehouse of commons thought all these to be antiquated principles they wereof opinion that the most parliamentary way of proceeding was to payfirst what the court thought proper to demand and to take its chance foran examination into accounts at some time of greater leisure</s> the nation had settled 800000 pounds a year on the crown as sufficientfor the purpose of its dignity upon the estimate of its own ministers</s> when ministers came to parliament and said that this allowance had notbeen sufficient for the purpose and that they had incurred a debt of500000 pounds would it not have been natural for parliament first tohave asked how and by what means their appropriated allowance came tobe insufficient</s>  would it not have savoured of some attention tojustice to have seen in what periods of administration this debt hadbeen originally incurred that they might discover and if need wereanimadvert on the persons who were found the most culpable</s>  to put theirhands upon such articles of expenditure as they thought improper orexcessive and to secure in future against such misapplication orexceeding</s>  accounts for any other purposes are but a matter ofcuriosity and no genuine parliamentary object</s>  all the accounts whichcould answer any parliamentary end were refused or postponed by previousquestions</s>  every idea of prevention was rejected as conveying animproper suspicion of the ministers of the crown</s> when every leading account had been refused many others were grantedwith sufficient facility</s> but with great candour also the house was informed that hardly any ofthem could be ready until the next session some of them perhaps not sosoon</s>  but in order firmly to establish the precedent of paymentprevious to account and to form it into a settled rule of the housethe god in the machine was brought down nothing less than the wonderworking law of parliament</s>  it was alleged that it is the law ofparliament when any demand comes from the crown that the house must goimmediately into the committee of supply in which committee it wasallowed that the production and examination of accounts would be quiteproper and regular</s>  it was therefore carried that they should go intothe committee without delay and without accounts in order to examinewith great order and regularity things that could not possibly comebefore them</s>  after this stroke of orderly and parliamentary wit andhumour they went into the committee and very generously voted thepayment</s> there was a circumstance in that debate too remarkable to be overlooked</s> this debt of the civil list was all along argued upon the same footing asa debt of the state contracted upon national authority</s>  its payment wasurged as equally pressing upon the public faith and honour and when thewhole years account was stated in what is called the budget theministry valued themselves on the payment of so much public debt just asif they had discharged 500000 pounds of navy or exchequer bills</s>  thoughin truth their payment from the sinking fund of debt which was nevercontracted by parliamentary authority was to all intents and purposesso much debt incurred</s>  but such is the present notion of public creditand payment of debt</s>  no wonder that it produces such effects</s> nor was the house at all more attentive to a provident security againstfuture than it had been to a vindictive retrospect to pastmismanagements</s>  i should have thought indeed that a ministerial promiseduring their own continuance in office might have been given thoughthis would have been but a poor security for the public</s>  mr</s>  pelham gavesuch an assurance and he kept his word</s>  but nothing was capable ofextorting from our ministers anything which had the least resemblance toa promise of confining the expenses of the civil list within the limitswhich had been settled by parliament</s>  this reserve of theirs i look uponto be equivalent to the clearest declaration that they were resolved upona contrary course</s> however to put the matter beyond all doubt in the speech from thethrone after thanking parliament for the relief so liberally grantedthe ministers inform the two houses that they will endeavour to confinethe expenses of the civil governmentwithin what limits think you</s> those which the law had prescribed</s>  not in the leastsuch limits asthe honour of the crown can possibly admit</s> thus they established an arbitrary standard for that dignity whichparliament had defined and limited to a legal standard</s>  they gavethemselves under the lax and indeterminate idea of the honour of thecrown a full loose for all manner of dissipation and all manner ofcorruption</s>  this arbitrary standard they were not afraid to hold out toboth houses while an idle and inoperative act of parliament estimatingthe dignity of the crown at 800000 pounds and confining it to that sumadds to the number of obsolete statutes which load the shelves oflibraries without any sort of advantage to the people</s> after this proceeding i suppose that no man can be so weak as to thinkthat the crown is limited to any settled allowance whatsoever</s>  for ifthe ministry has 800000 pounds a year by the law of the land and if bythe law of parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paidprevious to the production of any account i presume that this isequivalent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of thesubject and the moderation of the courtthat is to say it is such inincome as is possessed by every absolute monarch in europe</s>  it amountsas a person of great ability said in the debate to an unlimited power ofdrawing upon the sinking fund</s>  its effect on the public credit of thiskingdom must be obvious for in vain is the sinking fund the greatbuttress of all the rest if it be in the power of the ministry to resortto it for the payment of any debts which they may choose to incur underthe name of the civil list and through the medium of a committee whichthinks itself obliged by law to vote supplies without any other accountthan that of the more existence of the debt</s> five hundred thousand pounds is a serious sum</s>  but it is nothing to theprolific principle upon which the sum was voteda principle that may bewell called the fruitful mother of a hundred more</s>  neither is thedamage to public credit of very great consequence when compared with thatwhich results to public morals and to the safety of the constitutionfrom the exhaustless mine of corruption opened by the precedent and tobe wrought by the principle of the late payment of the debts of the civillist</s>  the power of discretionary disqualification by one law ofparliament and the necessity of paying every debt of the civil list byanother law of parliament if suffered to pass unnoticed must establishsuch a fund of rewards and terrors as will make parliament

accurately on whose cure they can say butvery little</s> the first ideas which generally suggest themselves for the cure ofparliamentary disorders are to shorten the duration of parliaments andto disqualify all or a great number of placemen from a seat in thehouse of commons</s>  whatever efficacy there may be in those remedies i amsure in the present state of things it is impossible to apply them</s>  arestoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indispensableto every other reformation</s>  what alterations ought afterwards to be madein the constitution is a matter of deep and difficult research</s> if i wrote merely to please the popular palate it would indeed be aslittle troublesome to me as to another to extol these remedies so famousin speculation but to which their greatest admirers have never attemptedseriously to resort in practice</s>  i confess them that i have no sort ofreliance upon either a triennial parliament or a placebill</s>  with regardto the former

befearful of committing every three years the independent gentlemen ofthe country into a contest with the treasury</s>  it is easy to see which ofthe contending parties would be ruined first</s>  whoever has taken acareful view of public proceedings so as to endeavour to ground hisspeculations on his experience must have observed how prodigiouslygreater the power of ministry is in the first and last session of aparliament than it is in the intermediate periods when members sit alittle on their seats</s>  the persons of the greatest parliamentaryexperience with whom i have conversed did constantly in canvassing thefate of questions allow something to the court side upon account of theelections depending or imminent</s>  the evil complained of if it exists inthe present state of things would hardly be removed by a triennialparliament for unless the influence of government in elections can beentirely taken away the more frequently they return the more they willharass private

to be done towards lessening that influence in elections andthis will be necessary upon a plan either of longer or shorter durationof parliament</s>  but nothing can so perfectly remove the evil as not torender such contentions foot frequently repeated utterly ruinous firstto independence of fortune and then to independence of spirit</s>  as i amonly giving an opinion on this point and not at all debating it in anadverse line i hope i may be excused in another observation</s>  with greattruth i may aver that i never remember to have talked on this subjectwith any man much conversant with public business who considered shortparliaments as a real improvement of the constitution</s>  gentlemen warmin a popular cause are ready enough to attribute all the declarations ofsuch persons to

public distempers</s> without being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident iwill only say that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious andmature reflection</s>  it is not easy to foresee what the effect would be ofdisconnecting with parliament the greatest part of those who hold civilemployments and of such mighty and important bodies as the military andnaval establishments</s>  it were better perhaps that they should have acorrupt interest in the forms of the constitution than they should havenone at all</s>  this is a question altogether different from

 that is what the bill proposes</s> first on this head i lay it down as a fundamental rule in the law andconstitution of this country that this house has not by itself alone alegislative authority in any case whatsoever</s>  i know that the contrarywas the doctrine of the usurping house of commons which threw down thefences and bulwarks of law which annihilated first the lords then thecrown then its constituents</s>  but the first thing that was done on therestoration of the constitution was to settle this point</s>  secondly ilay it down as a rule that the power of occasional incapacitation ondiscretionary grounds is a legislative power</s>  in order to establishthis principle if it should not be sufficiently proved by being statedtell me what are the criteria the characteristics by which youdistinguish between a legislative and a juridical act</s>  it will benecessary to state shortly the difference between a legislative and ajuridical act</s>  a legislative act has no reference to any rule but thesetwo original justice and discretionary application</s>  therefore it cangive rights rights where no rights existed before and it can take awayrights where they were before established</s>  for the law which binds allothers does not and cannot bind the lawmaker he and he alone isabove the law</s>  but a judge a person exercising a judicial capacity isneither to apply to original justice nor to a discretionary applicationof it</s>  he goes to justice and discretion only at second hand andthrough the medium of some superiors</s>  he is to work neither upon hisopinion of the one nor of the other but upon a fixed rule of which hehas not the making but singly and solely the application to the case</s> the power assumed by the house neither is nor can be judicial powerexercised according to known law</s>  the properties of law are first thatit should be known secondly that it should be fixed and not occasional</s> first this power cannot be according to the first property of lawbecause no man does or can know it nor do you yourselves know upon whatgrounds you will vote the incapacity of any man</s>

sir i know not the court has norule but its own discretion they will determine</s>  it is not a fixedlaw because you profess you vary it according to the occasion exerciseit according to your discretion no man can call for it as a right</s>  itis argued that the incapacity is not originally voted but a consequenceof a power of expulsion but if you expel not upon legal but uponarbitrary that is upon discretionary grounds and the incapacity is exvi termini and inclusively comprehended in the expulsion is not theincapacity voted in the expulsion</s>  are they not convertible terms</s>  andif incapacity is voted to be inherent in expulsion if expulsion bearbitrary incapacity is arbitrary also</s>  i have therefore shown thatthe power of incapacitation is a legislative power i have shown thatlegislative power does not belong to the house of commons andtherefore it follows that the house of commons has not a power ofincapacitation</s> i know not the origin of the house of commons but am very sure that itdid not create itself the electors wore prior to the elected whoserights originated either from the people at large or from some otherform of legislature which never could intend for the chosen a power ofsuperseding the choosers</s> if you have not a power of declaring an incapacity simply by the mere actof declaring it it is evident to the most ordinary reason you cannothave a right of expulsion inferring or rather including anincapacity for as the law when it gives any direct right gives also asnecessary incidents all the means of acquiring the possession of thatright so where it does not give a right directly it refuses all themeans by which such a right may by any mediums be exercised or in effectbe indirectly acquired</s>  else it is very obvious that the intention ofthe law in refusing that right might be entirely frustrated and thewhole power of the legislature baffled</s>  if there be no certaininvariable rule of eligibility it were better to get simplicity ifcertainty is not to be had and to resolve all the franchises of thesubject into this one short propositionthe will and pleasure of thehouse of commons</s> the argument drawn from the courts of law applying the principles oflaw to new cases as they emerge is altogether frivolous inapplicableand arises from a total ignorance of the bounds between civil andcriminal jurisdiction and of the separate maxims that govern these twoprovinces of law that are eternally separate</s>  undoubtedly the courts oflaw where a new case comes before them as they do every hour thenthat there may be no defect in justice call in similar principles andthe example of the nearest determination and do everything to draw thelaw to as near a conformity to general equity and right reason as theycan

incapacity arising from the supposed incongruity of two dutiesin the commonwealth secondly an incapacity arising from unfitness byinfirmity of nature or the criminality of conduct</s>  as to the firstclass of incapacities they have no hardship annexed to them</s>  thepersons so incapacitated are paid by one dignity for what they abandon inanother and for the most part the situation arises from their ownchoice</s>  but as to the second arising from an unfitness not fixed bynature but superinduced by some positive acts or arising fromhonourable motives such as an occasional personal

question is over if this is shown not to be a legislativeact</s>  but what is very usual and natural is to corrupt judicature intolegislature</s>  on this point it is proper to inquire whether a court ofjudicature which decides without appeal has it as a necessary incidentof such judicature that whatever it decides de jure is law</s>  nobodywill i hope assert this because the direct consequence would be theentire extinction of the difference between true and false judgments</s> for if the judgment makes the law and not the law directs the judgmentit is impossible there could be such a thing

question is by the constitution of thiscountry what degree of submission is due to the authoritative acts of alimited power</s>  this question of submission determine it how you pleasehas nothing to

courts is proper and constitutional and therefore should not bealtered</s>  2</s>  that it is neither proper nor constitutional but that itwill be rendered worse by your interference</s>  3</s>  that it is wrong butthat the only remedy is a bill of retrospect</s>  4</s>  the opinion of thosewho bring in the bill that the thing is wrong but that it is enough todirect the judgment of the court in future</s> the bill brought in is for the purpose of asserting and securing a greatobject in the juridical constitution of this kingdom which from a longseries of practices and opinions in our judges has in one point and inone very essential point deviated from the true principle</s> it is the very ancient privilege of the people of england that they shallbe tried except in the known exceptions not by judges appointed by thecrown but by their own fellowsubjects the peers of that county courtat which they owe their suit and service out of this principle trial byjuries has grown</s>  this principle has not that i can find beencontested in any case by any authority whatsoever but there is onecase in which without directly contesting the principle the wholesubstance energy acid virtue of the privilege is taken out of it thatis in the case of a trial by indictment or information for libel</s>  thedoctrine in that case laid down by several judges amounts to this thatthe jury have no competence where a libel is alleged except to find thegross corporeal facts of the writing and the publication together withthe identity of the things and persons to which it refers but that theintent and the tendency of the work in which intent and tendency thewhole criminality consists is the sole and exclusive province of thejudge</s>  thus having reduced the jury to the cognisance of facts not inthemselves presumptively criminal but actions neutral and indifferentthe whole matter in which the subject has any concern or interest istaken out of the hands of the jury and if the jury take more uponthemselves what they so take is contrary to their duty it is no moralbut a merely natural power the same by which they may do any otherimproper act the same by which they may even prejudice themselves withregard to any other part of the issue before them</s>  such is the matter asit now stands in possession of your highest criminal courts handed downto them from very respectable legal ancestors</s>  if this can once beestablished in this case the application in principle to other caseswill be easy and the practice will run upon a descent until theprogress of an encroaching jurisdiction for it is in its nature toencroach when once it has passed its limits coming to confine thejuries case after case to the corporeal fact and to that alone andexcluding the intention of mind the only source of merit and demerit ofreward or punishment juries become a dead letter in the constitution</s> for which reason it is high time to take this matter into theconsideration of parliament and for that purpose it will be necessary toexamine first whether there is anything in the peculiar nature of thiscrime that makes it necessary to exclude the jury from considering theintention in it more than in others</s>  so far from it that i take it tobe much less so from the analogy of other criminal cases where no suchrestraint is ordinarily put upon them</s>  the act of homicide is primafacie criminal</s>  the intention is afterwards to appear for the jury toacquit or condemn</s>  in burglary do they insist that the jury have nothingto do but to find the taking of goods and that if they do they mustnecessarily find the party guilty and leave the rest to the judge andthat they have nothing to do with the word felonice in the indictment</s> the next point is to consider it as a question of constitutional policythat is whether the decision of the question of libel ought to be leftto the judges as a presumption of law rather than to the jury as matterof popular judgment as the malice in the case of murder the felony inthe case of stealing</s>  if the intent and tendency are not matters withinthe province of popular judgment but legal and technical conclusionsformed upon general principles of law let us see what they are</s> certainly they are most unfavourable indeed totally adverse to theconstitution of this country</s> here we must have recourse to analogies for we cannot argue on ruledcases one way or the other</s>  see the history</s>  the old books deficientin general in crown cases furnish us with little on this head</s>  as to

representation in the house of commonsjune 1784mr</s>  speakerwe have now discovered at the close of the eighteenthcentury that the constitution of england which for a series of ages hadbeen the proud

gross imposition upon the understanding of mankind an insultto their feelings and acting by contrivances destructive to the best andmost valuable interests of the people</s>  our political architects havetaken a survey of the fabric of the british constitution</s>  it is singularthat they report nothing against the crown nothing against the lordsbut in the house of commons everything is unsound it is ruinous in everypart</s>  it is infested by the dry rot and ready to tumble about our earswithout their immediate help</s>  you know by the faults they find what aretheir ideas of the alteration</s>  as all government stands upon opinionthey know that the way utterly to destroy it is to remove that opinionto take away all reverence all confidence from it and then at thefirst blast of public discontent and popular tumult it tumbles to theground</s>
in considering this question they who oppose it oppose it on differentgrounds one is in the nature of a previous questionthat somealterations may be expedient but that this is not the time for makingthem</s>  the other is that no essential alterations are at all wantingand that neither now nor at any time is it prudent or safe to bemeddling with the fundamental principles and ancient tried usages of ourconstitutionthat our representation is as nearly perfect as thenecessary imperfection of human affairs and of human creatures willsuffer it to be and that it is a subject of prudent and honest use andthankful enjoyment and not of captious criticism and rash experiment</s> on the other side there are two parties who proceed on two groundsinmy opinion as they state them utterly irreconcilable</s>  the one isjuridical the other political</s>  the one is in the nature of a claim ofright on the supposed rights of man as man this party desire thedecision of a suit</s>  the other ground as far as i can divine what itdirectly means is that the representation is not so politically framedas to answer the theory of its institution</s>  as to the claim of rightthe meanest petitioner the most gross and ignorant is as good as thebest in some respects his claim is more favourable on account of hisignorance his weakness his poverty and distress only add to his titleshe sues in forma pauperis he ought to be a favourite of the court</s>  butwhen the other ground is taken when the question is political when anew constitution is to be made on a sound theory of government then thepresumptuous pride of didactic ignorance is to be excluded from thecouncil in this high and arduous matter which often bids defiance to theexperience of the wisest</s>  the first claims a personal representationthe latter rejects it with scorn and fervour</s>  the language of the firstparty is plain and intelligible they who plead an absolute right cannotbe satisfied with anything short of personal representation because allnatural rights must be the rights of individuals as by nature there isno such thing as politic or corporate personality all these ideas aremere fictions of law they are creatures of voluntary institution men asmen are individuals and nothing else</s>  they therefore who reject theprinciple of natural and personal representation are essentially andeternally at variance with those who claim it</s>  as to the first sort ofreformers it is ridiculous to talk to them of the british constitutionupon any or all of its bases for they lay it down that every man oughtto govern himself and that where he cannot go himself he must send hisrepresentative that all other government is usurpation and is so farfrom having a claim to our obedience that it is not only our right butour duty to resist it</s>  ninetenths of the reformers argue thusthatis on the natural right</s>  it is impossible not to make some reflectionon the nature of this claim or avoid a comparison between the extent ofthe principle and the present object of the demand</s>  if this claim befounded it is clear to what it goes</s>  the house of commons in thatlight undoubtedly is no representative of the people as a collection ofindividuals</s>  nobody pretends it nobody can justify such an assertion</s> when you come to examine into this claim of

havealways claimed them and on no other title</s>  the house of commons is alegislative body corporate by prescription not made upon any giventheory but existing prescriptivelyjust like the rest</s>  thisprescription has made it essentially what it isan aggregate collectionof three partsknights citizens burgesses</s>  the question is whetherthis has been always so since the house of commons has taken its presentshape and circumstances and has been an essential operative part of theconstitution which i take it it has been for at least five hundredyears</s> this i resolve to myself in the affirmative and then another questionarises whether this house stands firm upon its ancient foundations andis not by time and accidents so declined from its perpendicular as towant the hand of the
