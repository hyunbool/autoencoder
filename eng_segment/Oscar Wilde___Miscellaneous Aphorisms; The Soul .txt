 jesus moved in a community that allowedthe accumulation of private property just as ours does and the gospelthat he preached was not that in such a community it is an advantage fora man to live on

reads history not in theexpurgated editions written for schoolboys and passmen but in theoriginal authorities of each time one is absolutely sickened not bythe crimes that the wicked have committed but by the punishments thatthe good have inflicted and a community is infinitely more brutalisedby the habitual employment of punishment than it is by the occurrenceof crime</s>  it obviously follows that the more punishment is inflicted themore crime is produced and most modern legislation has clearlyrecognised this and has made it its task to diminish punishment as faras it thinks it can</s>  wherever it has really diminished it the resultshave always been extremely good</s>
when there is no punishment at all crime will either cease to existor if it occurs will be treated by physicians as a very distressingform of dementia to be cured by care and kindness</s>  for what

worsethan penal servitude a point on which our criminals i believedisagree</s>  but though a crime may not be against property it may springfrom the misery and rage and depression produced by our

entirely vanishes or becomes stereotyped ordegenerates into a low and ignoble form of craft</s>  a work of art is theunique result of a unique temperament</s>  its beauty comes from the factthat the author is what he is</s>  it has nothing to do with the fact thatother people want what they want</s>  indeed the moment that an artisttakes notice of what other people want and tries to supply the demandhe ceases to be an artist and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsmanan honest or a dishonest tradesman</s>  he has no further claim to beconsidered as an artist</s>  art is the most intense mode of individualismthat the world has known</s>  i am inclined to say that it is the only realmode of individualism that the world has known</s>  crime which undercertain conditions may seem to have created individualism must takecognisance of other people and interfere with them</s>  it belongs to thesphere of action</s>  but alone without any reference to his neighbourswithout any interference the artist can fashion a beautiful thing andif he does not do it solely for his own pleasure he is not an artist atall</s> and it is to be noted that it is the fact that art is this intense formof individualism that makes the public try to exercise over it anauthority that is as immoral as it is ridiculous and as corrupting asit is contemptible</s>  it is not quite their fault</s>  the public has alwaysand in every age been badly brought up</s>  they are continually asking artto be popular to please their want of taste to flatter their absurdvanity to tell them what they have been told before to show them whatthey ought to be tired of seeing to amuse them when they feel heavyafter eating too much and to distract their thoughts when they arewearied of their own stupidity</s>  now art should never try to be popular</s> the public should try to make itself artistic</s>  there is a very widedifference</s>  if a man of science were told that the results of hisexperiments and the conclusions that he arrived at should be of such acharacter that they would not upset the received popular notions on thesubject or disturb popular prejudice or hurt the sensibilities ofpeople who knew nothing about science if a philosopher were told thathe had a perfect right to speculate in the highest spheres of thoughtprovided that he arrived at the same conclusions as were held by thosewho had never thought in any sphere at allwell nowadays the man ofscience and the philosopher would be considerably amused</s>  yet it isreally a very few years since both philosophy and science were subjectedto brutal popular control to authority in factthe authority ofeither the general ignorance of the community or the terror and greedfor power of an ecclesiastical or governmental class</s>  of course we haveto a very great extent got rid of any attempt on the part of thecommunity or the church or the government to interfere with theindividualism of speculative thought but the attempt to interfere withthe individualism of imaginative art still lingers</s>  in fact it doesmore than linger it is aggressive offensive and brutalising</s> in england the arts that have escaped best are the arts in which thepublic take no interest</s>  poetry is an instance of what i mean</s>  we havebeen able to have fine poetry in england because the public do not readit and consequently do not influence it</s>  the public like to insultpoets because they are individual but once they have insulted themthey leave them alone</s>  in the case of the novel and the drama arts inwhich the public do take an interest the result of the exercise ofpopular authority has been absolutely ridiculous</s>  no country producessuch badlywritten fiction such tedious common work in the novel formsuch silly vulgar plays as england</s>  it must necessarily be so</s>  thepopular standard is of such a character that no artist can get to it</s>  itis at once too easy and too difficult to be a popular novelist</s>  it istoo easy because the requirements of the public as far as plot stylepsychology treatment of life and treatment of literature are concernedare within the reach of the very meanest capacity and the mostuncultivated mind</s>  it is too difficult because to meet suchrequirements the artist would have to do violence to his temperamentwould have to write not for the artistic joy of writing but for theamusement of halfeducated people and so would have to suppress hisindividualism forget his culture annihilate his style and surrendereverything that is valuable in him</s>  in the case of the drama things area little better the theatregoing public like the obvious it is truebut they do not like the tedious and burlesque and farcical comedy thetwo most popular forms are distinct forms of art</s>  delightful work maybe produced under burlesque and farcical conditions and in work of thiskind the artist in england is allowed very great freedom</s>  it is when onecomes to the higher forms of the drama that the result of popularcontrol is seen</s>  the one thing that the public dislike is novelty</s>  anyattempt to extend the subjectmatter of art is extremely distasteful tothe public and yet the vitality and progress of art depend in a largemeasure on the continual extension of subjectmatter</s>  the public dislikenovelty because they are afraid of it</s>  it represents to them a mode ofindividualism an assertion on the part of the artist that he selectshis own subject and treats it as he chooses</s>  the public are quite rightin their attitude</s>  art is individualism and individualism is adisturbing and disintegrating force</s>  therein lies its immense value</s>  forwhat it seeks to disturb is monotony of type slavery of custom tyrannyof habit and the reduction of man to the level of a machine</s>  in artthe public accept what has been because they cannot alter it notbecause they appreciate it</s>  they swallow their classics whole and nevertaste them</s>  they endure them as the inevitable and as they cannot marthem they mouth about them</s>  strangely enough or not strangelyaccording to ones own views this acceptance of the classics does agreat deal of harm</s>
 with regard to thebible considerations of ecclesiastical authority enter into the matterso that i need not dwell upon the point</s> but in the case of shakespeare it is quite obvious that the publicreally see neither the beauties nor the defects of his plays</s>  if theysaw the beauties they would not object to the development of the dramaand if they saw the defects they would not object to the development ofthe drama either</s>  the fact is the public make use of the classics of acountry as a means of checking the progress of art</s>  they degrade theclassics into authorities</s>  they use them as bludgeons for preventing thefree expression of beauty in new forms</s>  they are always asking a writerwhy he does not write like somebody else or a painter why he does notpaint like somebody else quite oblivious of the fact that if either ofthem did anything of the kind he would cease to be an artist</s>
 a freshmode of beauty is absolutely distasteful to them and whenever itappears they get so angry and bewildered that they always use twostupid expressionsone is that the work of art is grosslyunintelligible the other that the work of art is grossly immoral</s>  whatthey mean by these words seems to me to be this</s>  when they say a work isgrossly unintelligible they mean that the artist has said or made abeautiful thing that is new when they describe a work as grosslyimmoral they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thingthat is true</s>
 the former expression has reference to style the latterto subjectmatter</s>  but they probably use the words very vaguely as anordinary mob will use readymade pavingstones</s>  there is not a singlereal poet or prosewriter of this century for instance on whom thebritish public have not solemnly conferred diplomas of immorality andthese diplomas practically take the place with us of what in franceis the formal recognition of an academy of letters and fortunately makethe establishment of such an institution quite unnecessary in england</s> of course the public are very reckless in their use of the word</s>  thatthey should have called wordsworth an immoral poet was only to beexpected</s>  wordsworth was a poet</s>  but that they should have calledcharles kingsley an immoral novelist is extraordinary</s>  kingsleys prosewas not of a very fine quality</s>  still there is the word and they useit as best they can</s>  an artist is of course not disturbed by it</s>  thetrue artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself because he isabsolutely himself</s>  but i can fancy that if an artist produced a work ofart in england that immediately on its appearance was recognised by thepublic through their medium which is the public press as a work thatwas quite intelligible and highly moral he would begin to seriouslyquestion whether in its creation he had really been himself at all andconsequently whether the work was not quite unworthy of him and eitherof a thoroughly secondrate order or of no artistic value whatsoever</s> perhaps however i have wronged the public in limiting them to suchwords as immoral unintelligible exotic and unhealthy</s>  thereis one other word that they use</s>  that word is morbid</s>  they do not useit often</s>  the meaning of the word is so simple that they are afraid ofusing it</s>  still they use it sometimes and now and then one comesacross it in popular newspapers</s>  it is of course a ridiculous word toapply to a work of art</s>  for what is morbidity but a mood of emotion or amode of thought that one cannot express</s>  the public are all morbidbecause the public can never find expression for anything</s>  the artist isnever morbid</s>  he expresses everything</s>  he stands outside his subjectand through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects</s>  tocall an artist morbid because he deals with morbidity as hissubjectmatter is as silly as if one called shakespeare mad because hewrote king lear</s> on the whole an artist in england gains something by being attacked</s> his individuality is intensified</s>  he becomes more completely himself</s>  ofcourse the attacks are very gross very impertinent and verycontemptible</s>  but then no artist expects grace from the vulgar mind orstyle from the suburban intellect</s>  vulgarity and stupidity are two veryvivid facts in modern life</s>  one regrets them naturally</s>  but there theyare</s>  they are subjects for study like everything else</s>  and it is onlyfair to state with regard to modern journalists that they alwaysapologise to one in private for what they have written against one inpublic</s> within the last few years two other adjectives it may be mentionedhave been added to the very limited vocabulary of artabuse that is atthe disposal of the public</s>  one is the word unhealthy the other isthe word exotic</s>  the latter merely expresses the rage of the momentarymushroom against the immortal entrancing and exquisitely lovelyorchid</s>  it is a tribute but a tribute of no importance</s>  the wordunhealthy however admits of analysis</s>  it is a rather interestingword</s>
 in fact it is so interesting that the people who use it do notknow what it means</s> what does it mean</s>
 what is a healthy or an unhealthy work of art</s>  allterms that one applies to a work of art provided that one applies themrationally have reference to either its style or its subject or toboth together</s>  from the point of view of style a healthy work of art isone whose style recognises the beauty of the material it employs bethat material one of words or of bronze of colour or of ivory and usesthat beauty as a factor in producing the sthetic effect</s>  from the pointof view of subject a healthy work of art is one the choice of whosesubject is conditioned by the temperament of the artist and comesdirectly out of it</s>  in fine a healthy work of art is one that has bothperfection and personality</s>  of course form and substance cannot beseparated in a work of art they are always one</s>  but for purposes ofanalysis and setting the wholeness of sthetic impression aside for amoment we can intellectually so separate them</s>  an unhealthy work ofart on the other hand is a work whose style is obvious oldfashionedand common and whose subject is deliberately chosen not because theartist has any pleasure in it but because he thinks that the publicwill pay him for it</s>
 in fact the popular novel that the public callshealthy is always a thoroughly unhealthy production and what the publiccall an unhealthy novel is always a beautiful and healthy work of art</s> i need hardly say that i am not for a single moment complaining thatthe public and the public press misuse these words</s>  i do not see howwith their lack of comprehension of what art is they could possibly usethem in the proper sense</s>  i am merely pointing out the misuse and asfor the origin of the misuse and the meaning that lies behind it allthe explanation is very simple</s>  it comes from the barbarous conceptionof authority</s>  it comes from the natural inability of a communitycorrupted by authority to understand or appreciate individualism</s>  in aword it comes from that monstrous and

compulsion</s>  there are possibly some journalists who take a realpleasure in publishing horrible things or who being poor look toscandals as forming a sort of permanent basis for an income</s>  but thereare other journalists i feel certain men of education and cultivationwho really dislike publishing these things who know that it is wrong todo so and only do it because the unhealthy conditions

popular appetite as possible</s> it is a very degrading position for any body of educated men to beplaced in and i have no doubt that most of them feel it acutely</s> however let us leave what is really a very sordid side of the subjectand return to the question of popular control in the matter of art bywhich i mean public opinion dictating to the artist the form which he isto use the mode in which he is to use it and the materials with whichhe is to work</s>  i have pointed out that the arts which have escaped bestin england are the arts in which the public have not been interested</s> they are however interested in the drama and as a certain advance hasbeen made in the drama within the last ten or fifteen years it isimportant to point out that this advance is entirely due to a

it ornot the fact however remains that taste and temperament have to acertain extent been created in the public and that the public iscapable of developing these qualities</s>  the problem then is why

 what stopsthem</s> the thing that stops them it must be said again is their desire toexercise authority over the artist and over works of art</s>  to certaintheatres such as the lyceum and the haymarket the public seem to comein a proper mood</s>  in both of these theatres there have been individualartists who have succeeded in creating in their audiencesand everytheatre in london has its own audiencethe temperament to which artappeals</s>  and what is that temperament</s>  it is the temperament ofreceptivity</s>  that is all</s> if a man approaches a work of art with any desire to exercise authorityover it and the artist he approaches it in such a spirit that he cannotreceive any artistic impression from it at all</s>  the work of art is todominate the spectator the spectator is not to dominate the work ofart</s>  the spectator is to be receptive</s>  he is to be the violin on whichthe master is to play</s>  and the more completely he can suppress his ownsilly views his own foolish prejudices his own absurd ideas of whatart should be or should not be the more likely he is to understand andappreciate the work of art in question</s>  this is of course quiteobvious in the case of the vulgar theatregoing public of english menand women</s>  but it is equally true of what are called educated people</s> for an educated persons ideas of art are drawn naturally from what arthas been whereas the new work of art is beautiful by being what art hasnever been and to measure it by the standard of the past is to measureit by a standard on the rejection of which its real perfection depends</s> a temperament capable of receiving through an imaginative medium andunder imaginative conditions new and beautiful impressions is the onlytemperament that can appreciate a work of art</s>  and true as this is inthe case of the appreciation of sculpture and painting it is still moretrue of the appreciation of such arts as the drama</s>  for a picture and astatue are not at war with time</s>  they take no count of its succession</s> in one moment their unity may be apprehended</s>  in the case of literatureit is different</s>  time must be traversed before the unity of effect isrealised</s>  and so in the drama there may occur in the first act of theplay something whose real artistic value may not be evident to thespectator till the third or fourth act is reached</s>  is the silly fellowto get angry and call out and disturb the play and annoy the artists</s> no the honest man is to sit quietly and know the delightful emotionsof wonder curiosity and suspense</s>  he is not to go to the play to losea vulgar temper</s>  he is to go to the play to realise an artistictemperament</s>  he is to go to the play to gain an artistic temperament</s>  heis not the arbiter of the work of art</s>  he is one who is admitted tocontemplate the work of art and if the work be fine to forget in itscontemplation all the egotism that mars himthe egotism of hisignorance or the egotism of his information</s>  this point about the dramais hardly i think sufficiently recognised</s>  i can quite understand thatwere macbeth produced for the first time before a modern londonaudience many of the people present would strongly and vigorouslyobject to the introduction of the witches in the first act with theirgrotesque phrases and their ridiculous words</s>  but when the play is overone realises that the laughter of the witches in macbeth is asterrible as the laughter of madness in lear more terrible than thedaughter of iago in the tragedy of the moor</s>  no spectator of art needs amore perfect mood of receptivity than the spectator of a play</s>  themoment he seeks to exercise authority he becomes the avowed enemy of artand of himself</s>  art does not mind</s>  it is he who suffers</s> with the novel it is the same thing</s>  popular authority and therecognition of popular authority are fatal</s>  thackerays esmond is abeautiful work of art because he wrote it to please himself</s>  in hisother novels in pendennis in philip in vanity fair even attimes he is too conscious of the public and spoils his work byappealing directly to the sympathies of the public or by directlymocking at them</s>  a true artist takes no notice whatever of the public</s>

taught them the trick of tyranny</s> there are many other things that one might point out</s>  one might pointout how the renaissance was great because it sought to solve no socialproblem and busied itself not about such things but suffered theindividual to develop freely beautifully and naturally and so hadgreat and individual artists and great and individual men</s>  one mightpoint out how louis xiv</s>  by creating the modern state destroyed theindividualism of the artist and made things monstrous in their monotonyof repetition and contemptible in their conformity to rule anddestroyed throughout all france all those fine freedoms of expressionthat had made tradition new in beauty and new modes one with antiqueform</s>  but the past is of no importance</s>  the present is of no importance</s> it is with the future that we have to deal</s>  for the past is what manshould not have been</s>  the present is what man ought not to be</s>  thefuture is what artists are</s> it will of course be said that such a scheme as is set forth here isquite unpractical and goes against human nature</s>  this is perfectlytrue</s>  it is unpractical and it goes against human nature</s>  this is whyit is worth carrying out and that is why one proposes it</s>  for what is apractical scheme</s>  a practical scheme is either a scheme that is alreadyin existence or a scheme that could be carried out under existingconditions</s>  but it is exactly the existing conditions that one objectsto and any scheme that could accept these conditions is wrong andfoolish</s>  the conditions will be done away with and human nature willchange</s>  the only thing that one really knows about human nature is thatit changes</s>  change is the one quality we can predicate of it</s>  thesystems that fail are those that rely on the permanency of human natureand not on its growth and development</s>  the error of louis xiv</s>  was thathe thought human nature would always be the same</s>  the result of hiserror was the french revolution</s>  it was an admirable result</s>  all theresults of the mistakes of governments are quite admirable</s> it is to be noted also that individualism does not come to man with anysickly cant about duty which merely means doing what other people wantbecause they want it or any hideous cant about selfsacrifice which ismerely a survival of savage mutilation</s>  in fact it does not come to manwith any claims upon him at all</s>  it comes naturally and inevitably outof man</s>  it is the point to which all development tends</s>  it is thedifferentiation to which all organisms grow</s>  it is the perfection thatis inherent in every mode of life and towards which every mode of lifequickens</s>  and so individualism exercises no compulsion over man</s>  on thecontrary it says to man that he should suffer no compulsion to beexercised over him</s>  it does not try to force people to be good</s>  it knowsthat people are good when they are let alone</s>  man will developindividualism out of himself</s>  man is now so developing individualism</s>  toask whether individualism is practical is like asking whether evolutionis practical</s>  evolution is the law of life and there is no evolutionexcept towards individualism</s>  where this tendency is not expressed itis a case of artificiallyarrested growth or of disease or of death</s> individualism will also be unselfish and unaffected</s>  it has been pointedout that one of the results of the extraordinary tyranny of authority isthat words are absolutely distorted from their proper and simplemeaning and are used to express the obverse of their rightsignification</s>  what is true about art is true about life</s>  a man iscalled affected nowadays if he dresses as he likes to dress</s>  but indoing that he is acting in a perfectly natural manner</s>  affectation insuch matters consists in dressing according to the views of onesneighbour whose views as they are the views of the majority willprobably be extremely stupid</s>  or a man is called selfish if he lives inthe manner that seems to him most suitable for the full realisation ofhis own personality if in fact the primary aim of his life isselfdevelopment</s>  but this is the way in which everyone should live</s> selfishness is not living as one wishes to live it is asking others tolive as one wishes to live</s>  and unselfishness is letting other peopleslives alone not interfering with them</s>  selfishness always aims atcreating around it an absolute uniformity of type</s>  unselfishnessrecognises infinite variety of type as a delightful thing accepts itacquiesces in it enjoys it</s>  it is not selfish to think for oneself</s>  aman who does not think for himself does not think at all</s>  it is grosslyselfish to require of ones neighbour that he should think in the sameway and hold the same opinions</s>  why should he</s>  if he can think he willprobably think differently</s>  if he cannot think it is monstrous torequire thought of any kind from him</s>  a red rose is not selfish becauseit wants to be a red rose</s>  it would be horribly selfish if it wanted allthe other flowers in the garden to be both red and roses</s>  underindividualism people will be quite natural and absolutely unselfish andwill know the meanings of the words and realise them in their freebeautiful lives</s>  nor will men be egotistic as they are now</s>  for theegotist is he who makes claims upon others and the individualist willnot desire to do that</s>  it will not give him pleasure</s>  when man hasrealised individualism he will also realise sympathy and exercise itfreely and spontaneously</s>  up to the present man has hardly cultivatedsympathy at all</s>  he has merely sympathy with pain and sympathy withpain is not the highest form of sympathy</s>  all sympathy is fine butsympathy with suffering is the least fine mode</s>  it is tainted withegotism</s>  it is apt to become morbid</s>  there is in it a certain element ofterror for our own safety</s>  we become afraid that we ourselves might beas the leper or as the blind and that no man would have care of us</s>  itis curiously limiting too</s>  one should sympathise with the entirety oflife not with lifes sores and maladies merely but with lifes joy andbeauty and energy and health and freedom</s>  the wider sympathy is ofcourse the more difficult</s>  it requires more unselfishness</s>  anybody cansympathise with the sufferings of a friend but it requires a very finenatureit requires in fact the nature of a true individualisttosympathise with a friends success</s> in the modern stress of competition and struggle for place suchsympathy is naturally rare and is also very much stifled by the immoralideal of uniformity of type and conformity to rule which is so prevalenteverywhere and is perhaps most obnoxious in england</s> sympathy with pain there will of course always be</s>  it is one of thefirst instincts of man</s>  the animals which are individual the higheranimals that is to say share it with us</s>  but it must be rememberedthat while sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the worldsympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain</s>  it maymake man better able to endure evil but the evil remains</s>
 sympathy withconsumption does not cure consumption that is what science does</s>  andwhen socialism has solved the problem of poverty and science solved theproblem of disease the area of the sentimentalists will be lessenedand the sympathy of man will be large healthy and spontaneous</s>  manwill have joy in the contemplation of the joyous life of others</s> for it is through joy that the
