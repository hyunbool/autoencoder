from their hereditary trade of war to match himselfagainst the british strength</s>  i learned it all by personal observationin the seventies or from the lips of the great shepstone my chief andfriend and from my colleagues osborn fynney clarke and others everyone of them long since gone down</s> perhaps it may be as well that this is so at any rate in the case ofone who desires to write of the zulus as a reigning nation which nowthey have ceased to be and to try to show them as they were in alltheir superstitious madness and bloodstained grandeur</s> yet then they had virtues as well as vices</s>  to serve their country inarms to die for it and for the king such was their primitive ideal</s>  ifthey were fierce they were loyal and feared neither wounds nor doom ifthey listened to the

ofcivilised men not to the kraals of bantu savages where at any rate ofold they might be sought in vain</s> now everything is changed or so i hear and doubtless in the balancethis is best</s>  still we may wonder what are the thoughts that passthrough the mind of some ancient warrior of chakas or dingaans timeas he suns himself crouched on the ground for example where once stoodthe royal kraal

the differences between these sons of his became intolerablebecause of the tumult which they were causing in his country kingpanda their father the son of senzangakona and the brother of thegreat

the time of theannexation of the transvaal in 1877 who as zulu border agent with theexceptions of the late sir theophilus shepstone and the late sir melmothosborn perhaps knew more of that land and people than anyone else ofhis period</s> as a result of this hint given by a maddened king the great battle ofthe tugela was fought at endondakusuka in december 1856 between theusutu party commanded by cetewayo and the adherents of umbelazithe handsome his brother who was known among the zulus asindhlovuenesihlonti or the elephant with the tuft of hair from alittle lock of hair which grew low

sir melmothosborn gave them was the greys or upunga</s> whatever their exact title may have been however they made a greatstand</s>  at least he told me that when umbelazis impi or army began togive before the usutu onslaught these greys moved forward above 3000strong drawn up in a triple line and were charged by one of cetewayosregiments</s> the opposing forces met and the noise of their clashing shields saidsir melmoth was like the roll of heavy thunder</s>  then while he watchedthe veteran greys passed over the opposing regiment as a wave passesover a rockthese were his exact wordsand leaving about a third oftheir number dead or wounded among the bodies of the annihilated foecharged on to meet a second regiment sent against them by cetewayo</s>  withthese the struggle was repeated but again the greys conquered</s>  onlynow there were not more than five or six hundred of them left upon theirfeet</s> these survivors ran to a mound round which they formed a ring andhere for a long while withstood the attack of a third regiment untilat length they perished almost to a man buried beneath heaps of theirslain assailants the usutu</s> truly they made a noble end fighting thus against tremendous odds</s> as for the number who fell at this battle of endondakusuka mr</s>  fynneyin a pamphlet which he wrote says that six of umbelazis brothers diedwhilst it is estimated that upwards of 100000 of the peoplemenwomen and childrenwere slaina high and indeed an impossibleestimate</s> that curious personage named john dunn an englishman who became azulu chief and who actually fought in this battle as narrated by mr</s> quatermain however puts the number much lower</s>  what the true total waswill never be known but sir melmoth osborn told me that when he swamhis horse back across the tugela that night it was black with bodiesand sir theophilus shepstone also told me that when he visited the scenea day or two later the banks of the river were strewn with multitudes ofthem male and female</s> it was from mr</s>  fynney that i heard the story of the execution bycetewayo of the man who appeared before him with the ornaments ofumbelazi announcing that he had killed the prince with his own hand</s> of course this tale as mr</s>  quatermain points out bears a strikingresemblance to that recorded in the old testament in connection with thedeath of king saul</s> it by no means follows however that it is therefore apocryphalindeed mr</s>  fynney assured me that it was quite true although if hegave me his authorities i cannot remember them after a lapse of morethan thirty years</s> the exact circumstances of umbelazis death are unknown but the generalreport was that he died not by the assegais of the usutu but of abroken heart</s>  another story declares that he was drowned</s>  his body wasnever found and it is therefore probable that it sank in the tugela asis suggested in the following pages</s> i have only to add that it is quite in accordance with zulu beliefsthat a man should be haunted by the ghost of one whom he has murderedor betrayed or to be more accurate that the spirit umoya shouldenter into the slayer and drive him

trappings and accessories seen dimly through theglass of our conventions leaving out those aspects of it which we haveforgotten or do not think it polite to mention</s>  but i allan quatermainreflecting upon these matters in my ignorant and uneducated fashionhave always held that no one really understands human nature who hasnot studied it in the rough</s>  well that is the aspect of it with which ihave been best acquainted</s> for most of the years of my life i have handled the raw material thevirgin ore not the finished ornament that is smelted out of itifindeed it is finished yet which i greatly doubt</s>  i dare say that atime may come when the perfected generationsif civilisation as weunderstand it really has a future and any such should be allowedto enjoy their hour on the worldwill look back to us as crudehalfdeveloped creatures whose only merit was that we handed on theflame of life</s> maybe maybe for everything goes by comparison and at one end of theladder is the apeman and at the other as we hope the angel</s>  no notthe angel he belongs to a different sphere but that last expressionof humanity upon which i will not speculate</s>  while man is manthat isbefore he suffers the magical deathchange into spirit if such shouldbe his destinywell he will remain man</s>  i mean that the same passionswill sway him he will aim at the same ambitions he will know the samejoys and be oppressed by the same fears whether he lives in a kafirhut or in a golden palace whether he walks upon his two feet or as foraught i know he may do one day flies through the air</s>  this is certainthat in the flesh he can never escape from our atmosphere and whilehe breathes it in the main with some variations prescribed by climatelocal law and religion he

interesting peoples who if they should survive inthe savage competition of the nations probably are doomed to undergogreat changes</s>  therefore i tell of them before they began to change</s> now although i take it out of its strict chronological order the firstof these histories that i wish to preserve is in the main that of anextremely beautiful womanwith the exception of a certain nada

attractive namefor it wasvery attractive as the zulus said it especially those of them who werein love with herwas mameena daughter of umbezi</s>  her other namewas child of storm inganeyesipepo or more freely and shortlyowezulu but the word mameena had its origin in the sound of thewind that wailed about the hut when she was born</s>   the zulu word meenaor more correctly minameans  come here and would therefore be a name not unsuitable to  one of the heroines proclivities but mr</s>  quatermain does  not seem to accept this interpretation</s> editor</s> since i have been settled in england i have readof course in atranslationthe story of helen of troy as told by the greek poethomer</s>  well mameena reminds me very much of helen or rather helenreminds me of mameena</s>  at any rate there was this in common betweenthem although one of them was black or rather coppercolouredand the other whitethey both were lovely moreover they both werefaithless and brought men by hundreds to their deaths</s>  there perhapsthe resemblance ends since mameena had much more fire and grit thanhelen could boast who unless homer misrepresents her must have beenbut a poor thing after all</s>  beauty itself which those old rascals ofgreek gods made use of to bait their snares set for the lives and honourof men such was helen no more that is as i understand her who havenot had the advantage of a classical education</s>  now mameena althoughshe was superstitiousa common weakness of great mindsacknowledgingno gods in particular as we understand them set her own snares withvarying success

shouldchance to cast his eye upon this history</s> it was in the year 1854 that i first met mameena and my acquaintancewith her continued off and on until 1856 when it came to an end in afashion that

out of it the art of traffic being in truth repugnantto me</s>  but hunting was always the breath of my nostrilsnot that i amfond of killing creatures for any humane man soon wearies of slaughter</s> no it is the excitement of sport which before breechloaders came inwas acute enough i can assure you the lonely existence in wild placesoften with only the sun and the stars for companions the continualadventures the strange tribes with whom i came in contact in shortthe change the danger the hope always of finding something great andnew that attracted and still attracts me even now when i have foundthe great and the new</s>  there i must not go on writing like this or ishall throw down my pen and book a passage for africa and incidentallyto the next world no doubtthat world of the

the goods and some ivory that i hadtraded</s> this umbezi was a stout and genialmannered man of about sixty years ofage and what is rare among these people one who loved sport for itsown sake</s>  being aware of his tastes also that he knew the countryand was skilled in finding game i had promised him a gun if he wouldaccompany me and bring a few hunters</s>  it was a particularly bad gun thathad seen much service and one which had an unpleasing habit of goingoff at halfcock but even after he had seen it and i in my honesty hadexplained its weaknesses he jumped at the offer</s> o macumazana that is my native name often abbreviated intomacumazahn which means one who stands out or as many interpret it idont know how watcherbynighta gun that goes off sometimes whenyou do not expect it is much better than no gun at all and you are achief with a great heart to promise it to me for when i own the whitemans weapon i shall be looked up to and feared by everyone between thetwo

examininggingerly as though he thought it might go off again while unloaded andnodding towards someone who stood behind him</s> i turned and for the first time saw saduko whom i recognised at onceas a person quite out of the ordinary run of natives</s> he was a tall and magnificently formed young man who although hisbreast was scarred with assegai wounds showing that he was a warriorhad not yet attained to the honour of the ring of polished wax laidover strips of rush bound round with sinew and sewn to the hair theisicoco which at a certain age or dignity determined by the kingzulus are allowed to assume</s>  but his face struck me more even than hisgrace strength and stature</s>  undoubtedly it was a very fine face withlittle or nothing of the negroid type about it indeed he might havebeen a rather darkcoloured arab to which stock he probably threw back</s> the eyes too were large and rather melancholy and in his reserveddignified air there was something that showed him to be no commonfellow but one of breeding and intellect</s> siyakubona that is we see you anglice good morrow saduko isaid eyeing him curiously</s>  tell me who is mameena</s> inkoosi he answered in his deep voice lifting his delicately shapedhand in salutation a courtesy that pleased me who after all wasnothing but a white hunter inkoosi has not her father said that sheis his daughter</s> aye answered the jolly old umbezi but what her father has not saidis that saduko is her lover or rather would like to be</s>  wow</s>  sadukohe went on shaking his fat finger at him are you mad man that

she loves me o umbezi answered saduko looking down and that ismore than cattle</s> for you perhaps saduko but not for me who am poor and want cows</s> also he added glancing at him shrewdly are you so sure that mameenaloves you though you be such a fine man</s>  now i should have thought thatwhatever her eyes may say her heart loves no one but herself andthat in the end she will follow her heart and not her eyes</s>  mameena thebeautiful does not seek to be a poor mans wife and do all the hoeing</s> but bring me the hundred cattle and we will see for speaking truthfrom my heart if you were a big chief there is no one i should likebetter as a soninlaw unless it were macumazahn here he saiddigging me in the ribs with his elbow who would lift up my house onhis white back</s> now at this speech saduko shifted his feet uneasily it seemed to meas though he felt there was truth in umbezis estimate of his daughterscharacter</s>  but he only saidcattle can be acquired</s> or stolen suggested umbezi</s> or taken in war corrected saduko</s>  when i have a hundred head i willhold you to your word o father of mameena</s> and then what would you live on fool if you gave all your

lady who just then broke through the clouds</s> but great chief bangu lord loved by the son of senzangakona brotherof the black one chaka who has ridden hence on the assegai whatis the meaning of this play</s>  and he pointed to me and to the twosoldiers who held out my little arms</s> i kill the wizards cub zikali that is all answered bangu</s> i see i see laughed zikali</s>  a gallant deed</s>  you have butchered thefather and the mother and now you would butcher the child who has slainone of your grown warriors in fair fight</s>  a very gallant deed wellworthy of the chief of the amakoba</s>  well loose his spiritonly hestopped and took a pinch of snuff from a box which he drew from a slitin the lobe of his great ear</s> only what</s>  asked bangu hesitating</s> only i wonder bangu what you will think of the world in which youwill find yourself before tomorrows moon arises</s>  come back thence andtell me bangu for there are so many worlds beyond the sun and i wouldlearn for certain which of them such a one as you inhabits a man whofor hatred and for gain murders the father and the mother and thenbutchers the childthe child that could slay a warrior who has seenwarwith the spear hot from his mothers heart</s> do you mean that i shall die if i kill this lad</s>  shouted bangu in agreat voice</s> what else</s>  answered zikali taking another pinch of snuff</s> this wizard that we will go together</s> good good</s>  laughed the dwarf</s>  let us go together</s>  long have iwished to die and what better companion could i find than bangu chiefof the amakoba slayer of children to guard me on a dark and terribleroad</s>  come brave bangu come kill me if you can and again he laughedat him</s> now macumazahn the people of bangu fell back muttering for theyfound this business horrible</s>  yes even those who held my arms let go ofthem</s> what will happen to me wizard if i spare the boy</s>  asked bangu</s> zikali stretched out his hand and touched the scratch that the assegaihad made in me here</s>  then he held up his finger red with my bloodand looked at it in the light of the moon yes and tasted it with histongue</s> i think this will happen to you bangu he said</s>  if you spare thisboy he will grow into a man who will kill you and many others one day</s> but if you do not spare him i think that his spirit working as spiritscan do will kill you tomorrow</s>  therefore the question is willyou live a while or will you die at once taking me with you as yourcompanion</s>  for you must not leave me behind brother bangu</s> now bangu turned and walked away stepping over the body of my motherand all his people walked away after him so that presently zikali thewise and little and i were left alone</s> what</s>  have they gone</s>  said zikali lifting up his eyes from theground</s>  then we had better be going also son of matiwane lest heshould change his mind and come back</s>  live on son of matiwane that youmay avenge matiwane</s> a nice tale i said</s>  but what happened afterwards</s> zikali took me away and nurtured me at his kraal in the black kloofwhere he lived alone save for his servants for in that kraal he wouldsuffer no woman to set foot macumazahn</s>  he taught me much wisdom andmany secret things and would have made a great doctor of me had i sowilled</s>  but i willed it not who find spirits ill company and there aremany of them about the black kloof macumazahn</s>  so in the end he saidgo where your heart calls and be a warrior saduko</s>  but know thisyou have opened a door that can never be shut again and across thethreshold of that door spirits will pass in and out for all your lifewhether you seek them or seek them not</s> it was you who opened the door zikali i answered angrily</s> mayhap said zikali laughing after his fashion for i open when imust and shut when i must</s>  indeed in my youth before the zulus were apeople they named me opener of doors and now looking through one ofthose doors i see something about you o son of matiwane</s> what do you see my father</s>  i asked</s> i see two roads saduko the road of medicine that is the spiritroad and the road of spears that is the blood road</s>  i see youtravelling on the road of medicine that is my own road saduko andgrowing wise and great till at last far far away you vanish over theprecipice to which it leads full of years and honour and wealth fearedyet beloved by all men white and black</s>  only that road you must travelalone since such wisdom may have no friends and above all no womanto share its secrets</s>  then i look at the road of spears and see yousaduko travelling on that road and your feet are red with blood andwomen wind their arms about your neck and one by one your enemies godown before you</s>  you love much and sin much for the sake of the loveand she for whom you sin comes and goes and comes again</s>  and the road isshort saduko and near the end of it are many spirits and though youshut your eyes you see them and though you fill your ears with clay youhear them for they are the ghosts of your slain</s>  but the end of yourjourneying i see not</s>  now choose which road you will son of matiwaneand choose swiftly for i speak no more of this matter</s> then macumazahn i thought a while of the safe and lonely path ofwisdom also of the bloodred path of spears where i should find loveand war and my youth rose up in me andi chose the path of spears andthe love and the sin and the unknown death</s> a foolish choice saduko supposing that there is any truth in thistale of roads which there is not</s> nay a wise one macumazahn for since then i have seen mameena andknow why i chose that path</s> ah</s>  i said</s>  mameenai forgot her</s>  well after all perhaps there issome truth in your tale of roads</s>  when i have seen mameena i will tellyou what i think</s> when you have seen mameena macumazahn you will say that the choicewas very wise</s>  well zikali opener of doors laughed loudly when heheard it</s>  the ox seeks the fat pasture but the young bull the roughmountainside where the heifers graze he said and after all abull is better than an ox</s>  now begin to travel your own road son ofmatiwane and from time to time return to the black kloof and tell mehow it fares with you</s>  i will promise you not to die before i know theend of it</s> now macumazahn i have told you things that hitherto have lived in myown heart only</s>  and macumazahn bangu is in ill favour with panda whomhe defies in his mountain and i have a promisenever mind howthat hewho kills him will be called to no account and may keep his cattle</s>  willyou come with me and share those cattle o watcherbynight</s> get thee behind me satan i said in english then added in zulu idont know</s>  if your story is true i should have no objection to helpingto kill bangu but i must learn lots more about this business first</s> meanwhile i am going on a shooting trip tomorrow with umbezi the fatand i like you o chooser of the road of spears and blood</s>  will you bemy companion and earn the gun with two mouths in payment</s> inkoosi he said lifting his hand in salute with a flash of his darkeyes you are generous you honour me</s>  what is there that i should lovebetter</s>  yet he added and his face fell first i must ask zikali thelittle zikali my fosterfather</s> oh</s>  i said so you are still tied to the wizards girdle are you</s> not so macumazahn but i promised him not long ago that i wouldundertake no enterprise save that you know of until i had spoken withhim</s> how far off does zikali live</s>  i asked saduko</s> one days journeying</s>  starting at sunrise i can be there by sunset</s> good</s>  then i will put off the shooting for three days and come with youif you think that this wonderful old dwarf will receive me</s> i believe that he will macumazahn for this reasonhe told me thati should meet you and love you and that you would be mixed up in myfortunes</s> then he poured moonshine into your gourd instead of beer i answered</s> would you keep me here till midnight listening to such foolishness whenwe must start at dawn</s>  begone now and let me sleep</s> i go he answered with a little smile</s>  but if this is so omacumazana why do you also wish to drink of the moonshine of zikali</s> and he went</s> yet i did not sleep very well that night for saduko and his strange andterrible story had taken a hold of my imagination</s>  also for reasons ofmy own i greatly wished to see this zikali of whom i had heard a greatdeal in past years</s>  i wished further to find out if he was a commonhumbug like so many witchdoctors this dwarf who announced that myfortunes were mixed up with those of his fosterson and who at leastcould tell me something true or false about the history and positionof bangu a person for whom i had conceived a strong dislike possiblyquite unjustified by the facts</s>  but more than all did i wish to seemameena whose beauty or talents produced so much impression upon thenative mind</s>  perhaps if i went to see zikali she would be back at herfathers kraal before we started on our shooting trip</s> thus it was then that fate wove me and my doings into the web of somevery strange events terrible tragic and complete indeed as those of agreek play as it has often done both before and since those days</s> chapter ii</s>  the moonshine of zikalion the following morning i awoke as a good hunter always should dojust at that time when on looking out of the wagon nothing can be seenbut a little grey glint of light which he knows is reflected from thehorns of the cattle tied to the trektow</s>  presently however i sawanother glint of light which i guessed came from the spear of sadukowho was seated by the ashes of the cooking fire wrapped in his karossof wildcat skins</s>  slipping from the voorkisse or drivingbox i camebehind him softly and touched him on the shoulder</s>  he leapt up with astart which revealed his nervous nature then recognising me through thesoft grey gloom saidyou are early macumazahn</s> of course i answered am i not named watcherbynight</s>  now let usgo to umbezi and tell him that i shall be ready to start on our huntingtrip on the third morning from today</s> so we went to find that umbezi was in a hut with his last wife andasleep</s>  fortunately enough however as under the circumstances i didnot wish to disturb him outside the hut we found the old cow whosesore ear had kept her very wide awake who for purposes of her ownalthough etiquette did not allow her to enter the hut was waiting forher husband to emerge</s> having examined her wound and rubbed some ointment on it with her ileft my message</s>  next i woke up my servant scowl and told him that iwas going on a short journey and that he must guard all things until myreturn and while i did so took a nip of raw rum and made ready a bagof biltong that is sundried flesh and biscuits</s> then taking with me a singlebarrelled gun that same little purdeyrifle with which i shot the vultures on the hill of slaughter atdingaans kraal we started on foot for i would not risk my onlyhorse on such a journey</s>   for the story of this shooting of the vultures by allan  quatermain see the book called marie</s> editor</s> a rough journey it proved to be indeed over a series of bushclad hillsthat at their crests were covered with rugged stones among which nohorse could have travelled</s>  up and down these hills we went and acrossthe valleys that divided them following some path which i could notsee for all that livelong day</s>  i have always been held a good walkerbeing by nature very light and active but i am bound to say that mycompanion taxed my powers to the utmost for on he marched for hourafter hour striding ahead of me at such a rate that at times i wasforced to break into a run to keep up with him</s>  although my pride wouldnot suffer me to complain since as a matter of principle i would neveradmit to a kafir that he was my master at anything glad enough was iwhen towards evening saduko sat himself down on a stone at the top ofa hill and saidbehold the black kloof macumazahn which were almost the first wordshe had uttered since we started</s> truly the spot was well named for there cut out by water from theheart of a mountain in some primeval age lay one of the most gloomyplaces that ever i had beheld</s>  it was a vast cleft in which graniteboulders were piled up fantastically perched one upon another in greatcolumns and upon its sides grew dark trees set sparsely among therocks</s>  it faced towards the west but the light of the sinking sun thatflowed up it served only to accentuate its vast loneliness for it was abig cleft the best part of a mile wide at its mouth</s> up this dreary gorge we marched mocked at by chattering baboons andfollowing a little path not a foot wide that led us at length to a largehut and several smaller ones set within a reed fence and overhung by agigantic mass of rock that looked as though it might fall at any moment</s> at the gate of the fence two natives of i know not what tribe men offierce and forbidding appearance suddenly sprang out and thrust theirspears towards my breast</s> whom bring you here saduko</s>  asked one of them sternly</s> a white man that i vouch for he answered</s>  tell zikali that we waiton him</s> what need to tell zikali that which he knows already</s>  said the sentry</s> your food and that of your companion is already cooked in yonder hut</s> enter saduko with him for whom you vouch</s> so we went into the hut and ate also i washed myself for it was abeautifully clean hut and the stools wooden bowls etc</s>  were finelycarved out of red ivory wood this work saduko informed me being doneby zikalis own hand</s>  just as we were finishing our meal a messengercame to tell us that zikali waited our presence</s>  we followed him acrossan open space to a kind of door in the tall reed fence passing which iset eyes for the first time upon the famous old witchdoctor of whom somany tales were told</s> certainly he was a curious sight in those strange surroundings for theywere very strange and i think their complete simplicity added to theeffect</s>  in front of us was a kind of courtyard with a black floor madeof polished antheap earth and cowdung twothirds of which at leastwas practically roofed in by the huge overhanging mass of rock whereofi have spoken its arch bending above at a height of not less thansixty or seventy feet from the ground</s>  into this great precipicebackedcavity poured the fierce light of the setting sun turning it and allwithin it even the large straw hut in the background to the deep hueof blood</s>  seeing the wonderful effect of the sunset in that dark andforbidding place it occurred to me at once that the old wizard musthave chosen this moment to receive us because of its impressiveness</s> then i forgot these scenic accessories in the sight of the man himself</s> there he sat on a stool in front of his hut quite unattended andwearing only a cloak of leopard skins open in front for he wasunadorned with the usual hideous trappings of a witchdoctor such assnakeskins human bones bladders full of unholy compounds and soforth</s> what a man he was if indeed he could be called quite human</s>  hisstature though stout was only that of a child his head was enormousand from it plaited white hair fell down on to his shoulders</s>  his eyeswere deep and sunken his face was broad and very stern</s>  except for thissnowwhite hair however he did not look ancient for his flesh wasfirm and plump and the skin on his cheeks and neck unwrinkled whichsuggested to me that the story of his great antiquity was false</s>  a manwho was over a hundred years old for instance surely could not boastsuch a beautiful set of teeth for even at that distance i could seethem gleaming</s>  on the other hand evidently middle age was far behindhim indeed from his appearance it was quite impossible to guess evenapproximately the number of his years</s>  there he sat red in the redlight perfectly still and staring without a blink of his eyes at thefurious ball of the setting sun as an eagle is said to be able to do</s> saduko advanced and i walked after him</s>  my stature is not great andi have never considered myself an imposing person but somehow i do notthink that i ever felt more insignificant than on this occasion</s>  thetall and splendid native beside or rather behind whom i walked thegloomy magnificence of the place the bloodred light in which it wasbathed and the solemn solitary little figure with wisdom stamped uponits face before me all tended to induce humility in a man not naturallyvain</s>  i felt myself growing smaller and smaller both in a moral and aphysical sense i wished that my curiosity had not prompted me to seekan interview with yonder uncanny being</s> well it was too late to retreat indeed saduko was already standingbefore the dwarf and lifting his right arm above his head as he gave himthe salute of makosi</s>  whereon feeling that something was expectedof me i took off my shabby cloth hat and bowed then remembering mywhite mans pride replaced it on my head</s>   makosi the plural of inkoosi is the salute given  to zulu wizards because they are not one but many since in  them as in the possessed demoniac in the bible dwell an  unnumbered horde of spirits</s> editor</s> the wizard suddenly seemed to become aware of our presence for ceasinghis contemplation of the sinking sun he scanned us both with his slowthoughtful eyes which somehow reminded me of those of a chameleonalthough they were not prominent but as i have said sunken</s> greeting son saduko</s>  he said in a deep rumbling voice</s>  why are youback here so soon and why do you bring this flea of a white man withyou</s> now this was more than i could bear so without waiting for mycompanions answer i broke inyou give me a poor name o zikali</s>  what would you think of me if icalled you a beetle of a wizard</s> i should think you clever he answered after reflection for afterall i must look something like a beetle with a white head</s>  but whyshould you mind being compared to a flea</s>  a flea works by night and sodo you macumazahn a flea is active and so are you a flea is very hardto catch and kill and so are you and lastly a flea drinks its fill ofthat which it desires the blood of man and beast and so you have donedo and will macumazahn and he broke into a great laugh that rolledand echoed about the rocky roof above</s> once long years before i had heard that laugh when i was a prisonerin dingaans kraal after the massacre of retief and his company and irecognised it again</s> while i was searching for some answer in the same vein and not findingit though i thought of plenty afterwards ceasing of a sudden from hisunseemly mirth he went ondo not let us waste time in jests for it is a precious thing andthere is but little of it left for any one of us</s>  your business sonsaduko</s> baba</s>  that is the zulu for father said saduko this white inkoosifor as you know well enough he is a chief by nature a man of a greatheart and doubtless of high blood this i believe is true for i havebeen told that my ancestors were more or less distinguishedalthough if this is so their talents did not lie in the direction ofmoneymaking has offered to take me upon a shooting expedition and togive me a good gun with two mouths in payment of my services</s>  but i toldhim i could not engage in any fresh venture without your leave andheis come to see whether you will grant it my father</s> indeed answered the dwarf nodding his great head</s>  this clever whiteman has taken the trouble of a long walk in the sun to come here toask me whether he may be allowed the privilege of presenting you with aweapon of great value in return for a service that any man of your yearsin zululand would love to give for nothing in such company</s> son saduko because my eyeholes are hollow do you think it your partto try to fill them up with dust</s>  nay the white man has come becausehe desires to see him who is named openerofroads of whom he heard agreat deal when he was but a lad and to judge whether in truth he haswisdom or is but a common cheat</s>  and you have come to learn whether orno your friendship with him will be fortunate whether or no he will aidyou in a certain enterprise that you have in your mind</s> true o zikali i said</s>  that is so far as i am concerned</s> but saduko answered nothing</s> well went on the dwarf since i am in the mood i will try to answerboth your questions for i should be a poor nyanga that is doctorif i did not when you have travelled so far to ask them</s>  moreover omacumazana be happy for i seek no fee who having made such fortuneas i need long ago before your father was born across the black watermacumazahn no longer work for a rewardunless it be from the hand ofone of the house of senzangakonaand therefore as you may guess workbut seldom</s> then he clapped his hands and a servant appeared from somewhere behindthe hut one of those fiercelooking men who had stopped us at the gate</s> he saluted the dwarf and stood before him in silence and with bowedhead</s> make two fires said zikali and give me my medicine</s> the man fetched wood which he built into two little piles in front ofzikali</s>  these piles he fired with a brand brought from behind the hut</s> then he handed his master a catskin bag</s> withdraw said zikali and return no more till i summon you for i amabout to prophesy</s>  if however i should seem to die bury me tomorrowin the place you know of and give this white man a safeconduct from mykraal</s> the man saluted again and went without a word</s> when he had gone the dwarf drew from the bag a bundle of twisted rootsalso some pebbles from which he selected two one white and the otherblack</s> into this stone he said holding up the white pebble so that thelight from the fire shone on itsince save for the lingering redglow it was now growing darkinto this stone i am about to drawyour spirit o macumazana and into this oneand he held up the blackpebbleyours o son of matiwane</s>  why do you look frightened o bravewhite man who keep saying in your heart he is nothing but an uglyold kafir cheat</s>  if i am a cheat why do you look frightened</s>  is yourspirit already in your throat and does it choke you as this littlestone might do if you tried to swallow it</s>  and he burst into one of hisgreat uncanny laughs</s> i tried to protest that i was not in the least frightened but failedfor in fact i suppose my nerves were acted on by his suggestion andi did feel exactly as though that stone were in my throat only comingupwards not going downwards</s>  hysteria thought i to myself theresult of being overtired and as i could not speak sat still asthough i treated his gibes with silent contempt</s> now went on the dwarf perhaps i shall seem to die and if so do nottouch me lest you should really die</s>  wait till i wake up again and tellyou what your spirits have told me</s>  or if i do not wake upfor a timemust come when i shall go on sleepingwellfor as long as i havelivedafter the fires are quite out not before lay your hands uponmy breast and if you find me turning cold get you gone to some othernyanga as fast as the spirits of this place will let you o ye who wouldpeep into the future</s> as he spoke he threw a big handful of the roots that i have mentionedon to each of the fires whereon tall flames leapt up from them veryunholylooking flames which were followed by columns of dense whitesmoke that emitted a most powerful and choking odour quite unlikeanything that i had ever smelt before</s>  it seemed to penetrate allthrough me and that accursed stone in my throat grew as large as anapple and felt as though someone were poking it upwards with a stick</s> next he threw the white pebble into the righthand fire that which wasopposite to me sayingenter macumazahn and look and the black pebble he threw into thelefthand fire saying enter son of matiwane and look</s>  then come backboth of you and make report to me your master</s> now it is a fact that as he said these words i experienced a sensationas though a stone had come out of my throat so readily do our nervesdeceive us that i even thought it grated against my teeth as i opened mymouth to give it passage</s>  at any rate the choking was gone only now ifelt as though i were quite empty and floating on air as though i werenot i in short but a mere shell of a thing all of which doubtless wascaused by the stench of those burning roots</s>  still i could look and takenote for i distinctly saw zikali thrust his huge head first into thesmoke of what i will call my fire next into that of sadukos fire andthen lean back blowing the stuff in clouds from his mouth and nostrils</s> afterwards i saw him roll over on to his side and lie quite still withhis arms outstretched indeed i noticed that one of his fingers seemedto be in the lefthand fire and reflected that it would be burnt off</s>  inthis however i must have been mistaken since i observed subsequentlythat it was not even scorched</s> thus zikali lay for a long while till i began to wonder whether he werenot really dead</s>  dead enough he seemed to be for no corpse could havestayed more stirless</s>  but that night i could not keep my thoughtsfixed on zikali or anything</s>  i merely noted these circumstances in amechanical way as might one with whom they had nothing whatsoever todo</s>  they did not interest me at all for there appeared to be nothingin me to be interested as i gathered according to zikali because i wasnot there but in a warmer place than i hope ever to occupy namely inthe stone in that unpleasantlooking little righthand fire</s> so matters went as they might in a dream</s>  the sun had sunk completelynot even an afterglow was left</s>  the only light remaining was thatfrom the smouldering fires which just sufficed to illumine the bulk ofzikali lying on his side his squat shape looking like that of a deadhippopotamus calf</s>  what was left of my consciousness grew heartily sickof the whole affair i was tired of being so empty</s> at length the dwarf stirred</s>  he sat up yawned sneezed shook himselfand began to rake among the burning embers of my fire with his nakedhand</s>  presently he found the white stone which was now redhotat anyrate it glowed as though it wereand after examining it for a momentfinally popped it into his mouth</s>  then he hunted in the other fire forthe black stone which he treated in a similar fashion</s>  the next thing iremember was that the fires which had died away almost to nothing wereburning very brightly again i suppose because someone had put fuel onthem and zikali was speaking</s> come here o macumazana and o son of matiwane he said and i willrepeat to you what your spirits have been telling me</s> we drew near into the light of the fires which for some reason or otherwas extremely vivid</s>  then he spat the white stone from his mouth intohis big hand and i saw that now it was covered with lines and patcheslike a birds egg</s> you cannot read the signs</s>  he said holding it towards me and when ishook my head went on well i can as you white men read a book</s>  allyour history is written here macumazahn but there is no need to tellyou that since you know it as i do well enough having learned it inother days the days of dingaan macumazahn</s>  all your future also avery strange future and he scanned the stone with interest</s>  yes yesa wonderful life and a noble death far away</s>  but of these matters youhave not asked me and therefore i may not tell them even if i wishednor would you believe if i did</s>  it is of your hunting trip that you haveasked me and my answer is that if you seek your own comfort you will dowell not to go</s>  a pool in a dry riverbed a buffalo bull with thetip of one horn shattered</s>  yourself and the bull in the pool</s>  sadukoyonder also in the pool and a little halfbred man with a gun jumpingabout upon the bank</s>  then a litter made of boughs and you in it and thefather of mameena walking lamely at your side</s>  then a hut and you in itand the maiden called mameena sitting at your side</s> macumazahn your spirit has written on this stone that you shouldbeware of mameena since she is more dangerous than any buffalo</s>  if youare wise you will not go out hunting with umbezi although it is truethat hunt will not cost you your life</s>  there away stone and takeyour writings with you</s>  and as he spoke he jerked his arm and i heardsomething whiz past my face</s> next he spat out the black stone and examined it in similar fashion</s> your expedition will be successful son of matiwane he said</s> together with macumazahn you will win many cattle at the cost of sundrylives</s>  but for the restwell you did not ask me of it did you</s>  alsoi have told you something of that story before today</s>  away stone</s>  andthe black pebble followed the white out into the surrounding gloom</s> we sat quite still until the dwarf broke the deep silence with one ofhis great laughs</s> my witchcraft is done he said</s>  a poor tale was it not</s>  well huntfor those stones tomorrow and read the rest of it if you can</s>  why didyou not ask me to tell you everything while i was about it white man</s> it would have interested you more but now it has all gone from me backinto your spirit with the stones</s>  saduko get you to sleep</s>  macumazahnyou who are a watcherbynight come and sit with me awhile in my hutand we will talk of other things</s>  all this business of the stones isnothing more than a kafir trick is it macumazahn</s>  when you meet thebuffalo with the split horn in the pool of a dried river remember it isbut a cheating trick and now come into my hut and drink a kamba bowlof beer and let us talk of other things more interesting</s> so he took me into the hut which was a fine one very well lighted bya fire in its centre and gave me kafir beer to drink that i swallowedgratefully for my throat was dry and still felt as though it had beenscraped</s> who are you father</s>  i asked pointblank when i had taken my seat upona low stool with my back resting against the wall of the hut and litmy pipe</s> he lifted his big head from the pile of karosses on which he was lyingand peered at me across the fire</s>
 you know as muchas that dont you</s>  he answered</s>  my father went down so long agothat his does not matter</s>  i am a dwarf very ugly with some learningas we of the black house understand it and very old</s>  is there anythingelse you would like to learn</s> yes zikali how old</s> there there macumazahn as you know we poor kafirs cannot count verywell</s>  how old</s>  well when i was young i came down towards the coast fromthe great river you call it the zambesi i think with undwandwe wholived in the north in those days</s>  they have forgotten it now because itis some time ago and if i could write i would set down the history ofthat march for we fought some great battles with the people who used tolive in this country</s>  afterwards i was the friend of the father of thezulus he whom they still call inkoosi umkuluthe mighty chiefyou mayhave heard tell of him</s>  i carved that stool on which you sit for him andhe left it back to me when he died</s> inkoosi umkulu</s>  i exclaimed</s>  why they say he lived hundreds of yearsago</s> do they macumazahn</s>  if so have i not told you that we black peoplecannot count as well as you do</s>  really it was only the other day</s> anyhow after his death the zulus began to maltreat us undwandwe and thequabies and the tetwas with usyou may remember that they called usthe amatefula making a mock of us</s>  so i quarrelled with the zulus andespecially with chaka he whom they named uhlanya the mad one</s> you see macumazahn it pleased him to laugh at me becausei am not as other men are</s>  he gave me a name which meansthethingwhichshouldneverhavebeenborn</s>  i will not speak thatname it is secret to me it may not pass my lips</s>  yet at times hesought my wisdom and i paid him back for his names for i gave him veryill counsel and he took it and i brought him to his death althoughnone ever saw my finger in that business</s>  but when he was dead at thehands of his brothers dingaan and umhlangana and of umbopa umbopa whoalso had a score to settle with him and his body was cast out of thekraal like that of an evildoer why i who because i was a dwarf wasnot sent with the men against sotshangana went and sat on it atnight and laughed thus and he broke into one of his hideous peals ofmerriment</s> i laughed thrice once for my wives whom he had taken once for mychildren whom he had slain and once for the mocking name that he hadgiven me</s>  then i became the counsellor of dingaan whom i hated worsethan i had hated chaka for he was chaka again without his greatnessand you know the end of dingaan for you had a share in that war and ofumhlangana his brother and fellowmurderer whom i counselled dingaanto slay</s>  this i did through the lips of the old princess menkabayijamas daughter senzangakonas sister the oracle before whom all menbowed causing her to say that this land of the zulus cannot be ruledby a crimson assegai</s>  for macumazahn it was umhlangana who firststruck chaka with the spear</s>  now panda reigns the last of the sons ofsenzangakona my enemy panda the fool and i hold my hand from pandabecause he tried to save the life of a child of mine whom chaka slew</s> but panda has sons who are as chaka was and against them i work as iworked against those who went before them</s> why</s>  i asked</s> why</s>  oh</s>  if i were to tell you all my story you would understand whymacumazahn</s>  well perhaps i will one day</s>  here i may state that as amatter of fact he did and a very wonderful tale it is but as it hasnothing to do with this history i will not write it here</s> i dare say i answered</s>  chaka and dingaan and umhlangana and theothers were not nice people</s>  but another question</s>  why do you tellme all this o zikali seeing that were i but to repeat it to atalkingbird you would be smelt out and a single moon would not diebefore you do</s> oh</s>  i should be smelt out and killed before one moon dies should i</s> then i wonder that this has not happened during all the moons that aregone</s>  well i tell the story to you macumazahn who have had so much todo with the tale of the zulus since the days of dingaan because i wishthat someone should know it and perhaps write it down when everythingis finished</s>  because too i have just been reading your spirit and seethat it is still a white spirit and that you will not whisper it to atalkingbird</s> now i leant forward and looked at him</s> what is the end at which you aim o zikali</s>  i asked</s>  you are not onewho beats the air with a stick on whom do you wish the stick to fall atlast</s> on whom</s>  he answered in a new voice a low hissing voice</s>  why onthese proud zulus this little family of men who call themselves thepeople of heaven and swallow other tribes

stamp the zulus flat</s> well i thethingwhoshouldnothavebeenborn live on until thatday comes and when it comes i think that you and i macumazahn shallnot be far apart and that is why i have opened out my heart to you iwho have knowledge of the future</s>  there i speak no more of these thingsthat are to be who perchance have already said too much of them</s>  yet donot forget my words</s>  or forget them if you will for i shall remindyou of them macumazahn when the feet of your people have avenged thendwandes and others whom it pleases the zulus to treat as dirt</s> now this strange man who had sat up in his excitement shook his longwhite hair which after the fashion of wizards he wore plaited intothin ropes till it hung like a veil about him hiding his broad faceand deep eyes</s>  presently he spoke again through this veil of hairsayingyou are wondering macumazahn what saduko has to do with all thesegreat events that are to be</s>  i answer that he must play his part inthem not a very great part but still a part and it is for thispurpose that i saved him as a child from bangu dingaans man andreared him up to be a warrior although since i cannot lie i warnedhim that he would do well to leave spears alone and follow after wisdom</s> well he will slay bangu who now has quarrelled with panda and a womanwill come into the story one mameena and that woman will bring aboutwar between the sons of panda and from this war shall spring the ruinof the zulus for he who wins will be an evil king to them andbring down on them the wrath of a mightier race</s>  and sothethingthatshouldnothavebeenborn and the ndwandes and thequabies and twetwas whom it has pleased the conquering zulus to nameamatefula shall be avenged</s>  yes yes my spirit tells me all

since time will tell you the story</s>  and now go torest macumazahn as i must who am old and feeble</s>  and when it pleasesyou to visit me again we will talk further</s>  meanwhile remember alwaysthat i am nothing but an old kafir cheat who pretends to a knowledgethat belongs to no man</s>  remember it especially macumazahn when youmeet a buffalo with a split horn in the pool of a driedup river andafterwards when a woman named mameena makes a certain offer to youwhich you may be tempted to accept</s>  good night to you watcherbynightwith the white heart and the strange destiny good night to you and trynot to think too hardly of the old kafir cheat who just now is calledopenerofroads</s>  my servant waits without to lead you to your hutand if you wish to be back at umbezis kraal by nightfall tomorrowyou will do well to start ere sunrise since as you found in comingsaduko although he may be a fool is a very good walker and you do notlike to be left behind macumazahn do you</s> so i rose to go but as i went some impulse seemed to take him and hecalled me back and made me sit down again</s> macumazahn he said i would add a word</s>  when you were quite a ladyou came into this country with retief did you not</s> yes i answered slowly for this matter of the massacre of retief isone of which i have seldom cared to speak for sundry reasons althoughi have made a record of it in writing</s>  even my friends sir henrycurtis and captain good have heard little of the part i played in thattragedy</s>  but what do you know of that business zikali</s>   published under the title of marie</s> editor</s> all that there is to know i think macumazahn seeing that i was atthe bottom of it and that dingaan killed those boers on my advicejustas he killed chaka and umhlangana</s> you coldblooded old murderer i began but he interrupted me atonce</s> why do you throw evil names at me macumazahn as i threw the stone ofyour fate at you just now</s>  why am i a murderer because i brought aboutthe death of some white men that chanced to be your friends who hadcome here to cheat us black folk of our country</s> was it for this reason that you brought about their deaths zikali</s> i asked staring him in the face for i felt that he was lying to me</s> not altogether macumazahn he answered letting his eyes thosestrange eyes that could look at the sun without blinking fall beforemy gaze</s>  have i not told you that i hate the house of senzangakona</s> and when retief and his companions were killed did not the spilling oftheir blood mean war to the end between the zulus and the white men</s>  didit not mean the death of dingaan and of thousands of his people whichis but a beginning of deaths</s>  now do you understand</s> i understand that you are a very wicked man i answered withindignation</s> at least you should not say so macumazahn he replied in a newvoice one with the ring of truth in it</s> why not</s> because i saved your life on that day</s>  you escaped alone of the whitemen did you not</s>  and you never could understand why could you</s> no i could not zikali</s>  i put it down to what you would call thespirits</s> well i will tell you</s>  those spirits of yours wore my kaross andhe laughed</s>  i saw you with the boers and saw too that you were ofanother peoplethe people of the english</s>  you may have heard at thetime that i was doctoring at the great place although i kept out of theway and we did not meet or at least you never knew that we met for youwereasleep</s>  also i pitied your youth for although you do not believeit i had a little bit of heart left in those days</s>  also i knew that weshould come together again in the after years as you see we have donetoday and shall often do until the end</s>  so i told dingaan that whoeverdied you must be spared or he would bring up the people of georgei</s> e</s>  the english to avenge you and your ghost would enter into himand pour out a curse upon him</s>  he believed me who did not understandthat already so many curses were gathered about his head that one moreor less made no matter</s>  so you see you were spared macumazahn andafterwards you helped to pour out a curse upon dingaan without becominga ghost which is the reason why panda likes you so well today pandathe enemy of dingaan his brother</s>  you remember the woman who helpedyou</s>  well i made her do so</s>  how did it go with you afterwardsmacumazahn with you and the boer maiden across the buffalo river towhom you were making love in those days</s> never mind how it went i replied springing up for the old wizardstalk had stirred sad and bitter memories in my heart</s>  that time isdead zikali</s> is it macumazahn</s>  now from the look upon your face i should have saidthat it was still very much alive as things that happened in our youthhave a way of keeping alive</s>  but doubtless i am mistaken and it is allas dead as dingaan and as retief and as the others your companions</s> at least although you do not believe it i saved your life on thatred day for my own purposes of course not because one white life wasanything among so many in my count</s>  and now go to rest macumazahngo to rest for although your heart has been awakened by memories thisevening i promise that you shall sleep well tonight and throwing thelong hair back off his eyes he looked at me keenly wagging his big headto and fro and burst into another of his great laughs</s> so i went</s>  but ah</s>  as i went i wept</s> anyone who knew all that story would understand why</s>  but this is not theplace to tell it that tale of my first love and of the terrible eventswhich befell us in the time of dingaan</s>  still as i say i have writtenit down and perhaps one day it will be read</s> chapter iii</s>  the buffalo with the cleft horni slept very well that night i suppose because i was so dogtiredi could not help it but next day on our long walk back to umbeziskraal i thought a great deal</s> without doubt i had seen and heard very strange things both of thepast and the presentthings that i could not in the least understand</s> moreover they were mixed up with all sorts of questions of high zulupolicy and threw a new light upon events that happened to me and othersin my youth</s> now in the clear sunlight was the time to analyse these things andthis i did in the most logical fashion i could command although withoutthe slightest assistance from saduko who when i asked him questionsmerely shrugged his shoulders</s> these questions he said did not interest him i had wished to see themagic of zikali and zikali had been pleased to show me some very goodmagic quite of his best indeed</s>
 i could form my own conclusions in the light of the whitemans wisdom which everyone knew was great</s> i replied shortly that i could for sadukos tone irritated me</s>  ofcourse the truth was that he felt aggrieved at being sent off tobed like a little boy while his fosterfather the old dwarf madeconfidences to me</s>  one of sadukos faults was that he had always a verygood opinion of himself</s>  also he was by nature terribly jealous even inlittle things as the readers of his history if any will learn</s> we trudged on for several hours in silence broken at length by mycompanion</s> do you still mean to go on a shooting expedition with umbezi inkoosi</s> he asked or are you afraid</s> of what should i be afraid</s>  i answered tartly</s> of the buffalo with the split horn of which zikali told you</s>  whatelse</s> now i fear i used strong language about the buffalo with the splithorn a beast in which i declared i had no belief whatsoever eitherwith or without its accessories of dried riverbeds and waterholes</s> if all this old womans talk has made you afraid however i addedyou can stop at the kraal with mameena</s> why should the talk make me afraid macumazahn</s>  zikali did not say thatthis evil spirit of a buffalo would hurt me</s>  if i fear it is for youseeing that if you are hurt you may not be able to go with me to lookfor bangus cattle</s> oh</s>  i replied sarcastically it seems that you are somewhat selfishfriend saduko since it is of your welfare and not of my safety that youare thinking</s> if i were as selfish as you seem to believe inkoosi should i adviseyou to stop with your wagons and thereby lose the good gun with twomouths that you have promised me</s>  still it is true that i should likewell enough to stay at umbezis kraal with mameena especially if umbeziwere away</s> now as there is nothing more uninteresting than to listen toother peoples love affairs and as i saw that with the slightestencouragement saduko was ready to tell me all the history of hiscourtship over again i did not continue the argument</s>  so we finishedour journey in silence and arrived at umbezis kraal a little aftersundown to find to the disappointment of both of us that mameena wasstill away</s> upon the following morning we started on our shooting expedition theparty consisting of myself my servant scowl who as i think i saidhailed from the cape and was half a hottentot saduko the merry oldzulu umbezi and a number of his men to serve as bearers and beaters</s> it proved a very successful tripthat is until the end of itfor inthose days the game in this part of the country was extremely plentiful</s> before the end of the second week i killed four elephants two of themwith large tusks while saduko who soon developed into a very fairshot bagged another with the doublebarrelled gun that i had promisedhim</s>  also umbezihow i have never discovered for the thing partookof the nature of a miraclemanaged to slay an elephant cow with fairivories using the old rifle that went off at halfcock</s> never have i seen a man black or white so delighted as was thatvainglorious kafir</s>  for whole hours he danced and sang and took snuffand saluted with his hand telling me the story of his deed over andover again no single version of which tale agreed with the other</s>  hetook a new title also that meant eaterupofelephants he allowedone of his men to bongathat is praisehim all through the nightpreventing us from getting a wink of sleep until at last the poorfellow dropped in a kind of fit from exhaustion and so forth</s>  it reallywas very amusing until it became a bore</s> besides the elephants we killed lots of other things including twolions which i got almost with a right and left and three whiterhinoceroses that now alas</s>  are nearly extinct</s>  at last towards theend of the third week we had as much as our men could carry in theshape of ivory rhinoceros horns skins and sundried buckflesh orbiltong and determined to start back for umbezis kraal next day</s> indeed this could not be long delayed as our powder and lead wererunning low for in those days it will be remembered breechloaders hadnot come in and ammunition therefore had to be carried in bulk</s> to tell the truth i was very glad that our trip had come to such asatisfactory conclusion for although i would not admit it even tomyself i could not get rid of a kind of sneaking dread lest afterall there might be something in the old dwarfs prophecy about adisagreeable adventure with a buffalo which was in store for me</s>  wellas it chanced we had not so much as seen a buffalo and as the roadwhich we were going to take back to the kraal ran over high barecountry that these animals did not frequent there was now littleprospect of our doing soall of which of course showed what i alreadyknew that only weakheaded superstitious idiots would put the slightestfaith in the drivelling nonsense of deceiving or selfdeceived kafirmedicinemen</s>  these things indeed i pointed out with much vigour tosaduko before we turned in on the last night of the hunt</s> saduko listened in silence and said nothing at all except that he wouldnot keep me up any longer as i must be tired</s> now whatever may be the reason for it my experience in life is that itis never wise to brag about anything</s>  at any rate on a hunting trip tocome to a particular instance wait until you are safe at home till youbegin to do so</s>  of the truth of this ancient adage i was now destined toexperience a particularly fine and concrete example</s> the place where we had camped was in scattered bush overlooking a greatextent of dry reeds that in the wet season was doubtless a swamp fed bya small river which ran into it on the side opposite to our camp</s>  duringthe night i woke up thinking that i heard some big beasts moving inthese reeds but as no further sounds reached my ears i went to sleepagain</s> shortly after dawn i was awakened by a voice calling me which in a hazyfashion i recognised as that of umbezi</s> macumazahn said the voice in a hoarse whisper the reeds below usare full of buffalo</s>  get up</s>  get up at once</s> what for</s>  i answered</s>  if the buffalo came into the reeds they will goout of them</s>  we do not want meat</s> no macumazahn but i want their hides</s>  panda the king has demandedfifty shields of me and without killing oxen that i can ill spare ihave not the skins whereof to make them</s>  now these buffalo are in atrap</s>  this swamp is like a dish with one mouth</s>  they cannot get outat the sides of the dish and the mouth by which they came in is verynarrow</s>  if we station ourselves at either side of it we can kill many ofthem</s> by this time i was thoroughly awake and had arisen from my blankets</s> throwing a kaross over my shoulders i left the hut made of boughsin which i was sleeping and walked a few paces to the crest of a rockyridge whence i could see the dry vlei below</s>  here the mists of dawnstill clung but from it rose sounds of grunts bellows and tramplingswhich i an old hunter could not mistake</s>  evidently a herd of buffaloone or two hundred of them had established themselves in those reeds</s> just then my bastard servant scowl and saduko joined us both of themfull of excitement</s> it appeared that scowl who never seemed to sleep at any natural timehad seen the buffalo entering the reeds and estimated their number attwo or three hundred</s>  saduko had examined the cleft through which theypassed and reported it to be so narrow that we could kill any number ofthem as they rushed out to escape</s> quite so</s>  i understand i said</s>  well my opinion is that we hadbetter let them escape</s>  only four of us counting umbezi are armed withguns and assegais are not of much use against buffalo</s>  let them go isay</s> umbezi thinking of a cheap raw material for the shields which had beenrequisitioned by the king who would surely be pleased if they were madeof such a rare and tough hide as that of buffalo protestedviolently and saduko either to please one whom he hoped might be hisfatherinlaw or from sheer love of sport for which he always had apositive passion backed him up</s>  only scowlwhose dash of hottentotblood made him cunning and cautioustook my side pointing out that wewere very short of powder and that buffalo ate up much lead</s>  at lastsaduko saidthe lord macumazana is our captain we must obey him although it is apity</s>  but doubtless the prophesying of zikali weighs upon his mind sothere is nothing to be done</s> zikali</s>  exclaimed umbezi</s>  what has the old dwarf to do with thismatter</s> never mind what he has or has not to do with it i broke in foralthough i do not think that he meant them as a taunt but merely as astatement of fact sadukos words stung me to the quick especially asmy conscience told me that they were not altogether without foundation</s> we will try to kill some of these buffalo i went on althoughunless the herd should get bogged which is not likely as the swamp isvery dry i do not think that we can hope for more than eight or ten atthe most which wont be of much use for shields</s>  come let us make aplan</s>  we have no time to lose for i think they will begin to move againbefore the sun is well up</s> half an hour later the four of us who were armed with guns were postedbehind rocks on either side of the steep natural roadway cut by waterwhich led down to the vlei and with us some of umbezis men</s>  that chiefhimself was at my sidea post of honour which he had insisted upontaking</s>  to tell the truth i did not dissuade him for i thought thati should be safer so than if he were opposite to me since even if theold rifle did not go off of its own accord umbezi when excited was amost uncertain shot</s>  the herd of buffalo appeared to have lain down inthe reeds so being careful to post ourselves first we sent three ofthe native bearers to the farther side of the vlei with instructions torouse the beasts by shouting</s>  the remainder of the zulusthere were tenor a dozen of them armed with stabbing spearswe kept with us</s> but what did these scoundrels do</s>  instead of disturbing the herdby making a noise as we told them for some reason best known tothemselvesi expect it was because they were afraid to go into thevlei where they might meet the horn of a buffalo at any momenttheyfired the dry reeds in three or four places at once and this if youplease with a strong wind blowing from them to us</s>  in a minute or twothe farther side of the swamp was a sheet of crackling flame that gaveoff clouds of dense white smoke</s>  then pandemonium began</s> the sleeping buffalo leapt to their feet and after a few moments ofindecision crashed towards us the whole huge herd of them snortingand bellowing like mad things</s>  seeing what was about to happen i nippedbehind a big boulder while scowl shinned up a mimosa with the swiftnessof a cat and heedless of its thorns sat himself in an eagles nestat the top</s>  the zulus with the spears bolted to take cover where theycould</s>  what became of saduko i did not see but old umbezi bewilderedwith excitement jumped into the exact middle of the roadway shoutingthey come</s>  they come</s>  charge buffalo folk if you will</s>  theeaterupofelephants awaits you</s> you etceterad old fool</s>  i shouted but got no farther for just atthis moment the first of the buffalo which i could see was an enormousbull probably the leader of the herd accepted umbezis invitation andcame with its nose stuck straight out in front of it</s>  umbezis gun wentoff and next instant he went up</s>  through the smoke i saw his black bulkin the air and then heard it alight with a thud on the top of the rockbehind which i was crouching</s> exit umbezi i said to myself and by way of a requiem let the bullwhich had hoisted him as i thought to heaven have an ounce of leadin the ribs as it passed me</s>  after that i did not fire any more for itoccurred to me that it was as well not to further advertise my presence</s> in all my hunting experience i cannot remember ever seeing such a sightas that which followed</s>  out of the vlei rushed the buffalo by dozensevery one of them making remarks in its own language as it came</s>  theyjammed in the narrow roadway they leapt on to each others backs</s>  theysquealed they kicked they bellowed</s>  they charged my friendly rock tilli felt it shake</s>  they knocked over scowls mimosa thorn and would haveshot him out of his eagles nest

at last</s>  with the exception of some calves which had beentrampled to death in the rush the herd had gone</s>  now like the romanemperori think he was an emperori began to wonder what had become ofmy legions</s> umbezi i shouted or rather sneezed through the smoke are youdead umbezi</s> yes yes macumazahn replied a choking and melancholy voice from thetop of the rock i am dead quite dead</s>  that evil spirit of a silwanai</s> e</s>  wild beast has killed me</s>  oh</s>  why did i think i was a hunter whydid i not stop at my kraal and count my cattle</s> i am sure i dont know you old lunatic i answered as i scrambled upthe rock to bid him goodbye</s> it was a rock with a razor top like the ridge of a house andthere hanging across this ridge like a pair of nether garments on aclothesline i found the eaterupofelephants</s> where did he get you umbezi</s>  i asked for i could not see his woundsbecause of the smoke</s> behind macumazahn behind</s>  he groaned for i had turned to fly butalas</s>  too late</s> on the contrary i replied for one so heavy you flew very well likea bird umbezi like a bird</s> look and see what the evil beast has done to me macumazahn</s>  it will beeasy for my moocha has gone</s> so i looked examining umbezis ample proportions with care but coulddiscover nothing except a large smudge of black mud as though he hadsat down in a halfdried puddle</s>  then i guessed the truth</s>  the buffaloshorns had missed him</s>  he had been struck only with its muddy nosewhich being almost as broad as that portion of umbezi with which itcame in contact had inflicted nothing worse than a bruise</s>  when i wassure he had received no serious injury my temper already sorely triedgave out and i administered to him the soundest smackinghis positionbeing very convenientthat he had ever received since he was a littleboy</s> get up you idiot</s>  i shouted and let us look for the others</s>  thisis the end of your folly in making me attack a herd of buffalo in reeds</s> get up</s>  am i to stop here till i choke</s> do you mean to tell me that i have no mortal wound macumazahn</s>  heasked with a return of cheerfulness accepting the castigation in goodpart for he was not one who bore malice</s>  oh i am glad to hear it fornow i shall live to make those cowards who fired the reeds sorry thatthey are not dead also to finish off that wild beast for i hit himmacumazahn i hit him</s> i dont know whether you hit him i know he hit you i replied as ishoved him off the rock and ran towards the tilted tree where i had lastseen scowl</s> here i beheld another strange sight</s>  scowl was still seated in theeagles nest that he shared with two nearly fledged young birds one ofwhich having been injured was uttering piteous cries</s>  nor did it cryin vain for its parents which were of that great variety of kite thatthe boers call lammefange or lamblifters had just arrived to itsassistance and were giving their new nestling scowl the best doingthat man ever received at the beak and claws of feathered kind</s>  seenthrough those rushing smoke wreaths the combat looked perfectlytitanic also it was one of the noisiest to which i ever listened fori dont know which shrieked the more loudly the infuriated eagles ortheir victim</s> seeing how things stood i burst into a roar of laughter and just thenscowl grabbed the leg of the male bird that was planted in his breastwhile it removed tufts of his wool with its hooked beak and leaptboldly from the nest which had become too hot to hold him</s>  the eaglesoutspread wings broke his fall for they acted as a parachute and sodid umbezi upon whom he chanced to land</s>  springing from the prostrateshape of the chief who now had a bruise in front to match that behindscowl covered with pecks and scratches ran like a lamplighterleaving me to collect my second gun which he had dropped at the bottomof the tree but fortunately without injuring it</s>  the kafirsgave him another name after that encounter which meanthewhofightsbirdsandgetstheworstofit</s> well we escaped from the line of the smoke a dishevelled trioindeedumbezi had nothing left on him except his head ringand shouted for theothers if perchance they had not been trodden to death in the rush</s>  thefirst to arrive was saduko who looked quite calm and untroubled butstared at us in astonishment and asked coolly what we had been doingto get in such a state</s>  i replied in appropriate language and asked inturn how he had managed to remain so nicely dressed</s> he did not answer but i believe the truth was that he had crept intoa large antbears holesmall blame to him to be frank</s>  then theremainder of our party turned up one by one some of them looking veryblown as though they had run a long way</s>  none were missing exceptthose who had fired the reeds and they thought it well to keep clearfor a good many hours</s>  i believe that afterwards they regretted nothaving taken a longer leave of absence but when they finally didarrive i was in no condition to note what passed between them and theiroutraged chief</s> being collected the question arose what we should do</s>  of course iwished to return to camp and get out of this illomened place as soonas possible</s>  but i had reckoned without the vanity of umbezi</s>  umbezistretched over the edge of a sharp rock whither he had been hoisted bythe nose of a buffalo and imagining himself to be mortally woundedwas one thing but umbezi in a borrowed moocha although because ofhis bruises he supported his

one of themechoedyes by all means let us follow it eaterupofelephants</s> macumazahn the clever white man will show us how for where is thebuffalo that he fears</s> of course after this there was nothing else to be done so havingsummoned the scratched scowl who seemed to have no heart in thebusiness we started on the spoor of the herd which was as easy totrack as a wagon road</s> never mind baas said scowl they are two hours march off by now</s> i hope so i answered but as it happened luck was against me forbefore we had covered half a mile some overzealous fellow struck ablood spoor</s> i marched on that spoor for twenty minutes or so till we came to apatch of bush that sloped downwards to a riverbed</s>  right to this riveri followed it till i reached the edge of a big pool that was still fullof water although the river itself had gone dry</s>  here i stood lookingat the spoor and consulting with saduko as to whether the beast couldhave swum the pool for the tracks that went to its very verge hadbecome confused and uncertain</s>  suddenly our doubts were ended sinceout of a patch of dense bush which we had passedfor it had played thecommon trick of doubling back on its own

hut of zikali rose beforemethe old dwarf his words everything</s>  i lifted my rifle and fired atthe charging beast but knew that the bullet glanced from its skull</s>  ithrew down the gunfor the buffalo was right on meand tried to jumpaside</s> almost i did so but that cleft horn to which hung the remainsof umbezis moocha scooped me up and hurled me off the river bankbackwards and sideways into the deep pool below</s>  as i departed thither isaw saduko spring forward and heard a shot fired that caused the bull tocollapse for a moment</s>  then with a slow sliding motion it followed meinto the pool</s> now we were together and there was no room for both so after a certainamount of dodging i went under as the lighter dog always does in afight</s>  that buffalo seemed to do everything to me which a buffalocould do under the circumstances</s>  it tried to horn me and partiallysucceeded although i ducked at each swoop</s>  then it struck me with itsnose and drove me to the bottom of the pool although i got hold of itslip and twisted it</s>  then it calmly knelt on me and sank me deeper anddeeper into the mud</s>  i remember kicking it in the stomach</s>  after this iremember no more except a kind of wild dream in which i rehearsedall the scene in the dwarfs hut and his request that when i met thebuffalo with the cleft horn in the pool of a dried river i shouldremember that he was nothing but a poor old kafir cheat</s> after this i saw my mother bending over a little child in my bed in theold house in oxfordshire where i was born and thenblackness</s> i came to myself again and saw instead of my mother the stately figureof saduko bending over me upon one side and on the other that of scowlthe halfbred hottentot who was weeping for his hot tears

gave it up as before and since that day i have found itnecessary to do in the case of many other events in life</s>  indeedthe question is one that i often have had cause to ask where kafirwitchdoctors or prophets are concerned notably in the instance of acertain mavovo of whom i hope to tell one day whose predictions savedmy life and those of my companions</s> just then i heard the sound of someone creeping through the beeholeof the hut and halfclosed my eyes as i did not feel inclined forconversation</s>  the person came and stood over me and somehowbyinstinct i supposei became aware that my visitor was a woman</s>  veryslowly i lifted my eyelids just enough to enable me to see her</s> there standing in a beam of golden light that passing through thesmokehole pierced the soft gloom of the hut stood the most beautifulcreature that i had ever seenthat is if it be admitted that a personwho is black or rather coppercoloured can be beautiful</s> she was a little above the medium height not more with a figure thatso far as i am a judge of such matters was absolutely perfectthat ofa greek statue indeed</s>  on this point i had an opportunity of forming anopinion since except for her little bead apron and a single stringof large blue beads about her throat her costume waswell that ofa greek statue</s>  her features showed no trace of the negro type on thecontrary they were singularly well cut the nose being straight andfine and the pouting mouth that just showed the ivory teeth betweenvery small</s>  then the eyes large dark and liquid like those of abuck set beneath a smooth broad forehead on which the curling but notwoolly hair grew low</s>  this hair by the way was not dressed up in anyof the eccentric native fashions but simply parted in the middle andtied in a big knot over the nape of the neck the little ears peepingout through its tresses</s>  the hands like the feet were very small anddelicate and the curves of the bust soft and full without being coarseor even showing the promise of coarseness</s> a lovely woman truly and yet there was something not quite pleasingabout that beautiful face something notwithstanding its childlikeoutline which reminded me of a flower breaking into bloom that onedoes not associate with youth and innocence</s>  i tried to analyse whatthis might be and came to the conclusion that without being hard itwas too clever and in a sense too reflective</s>  i felt even then thatthe brain within the shapely head was keen and bright as polished steelthat this woman was one made to rule not to be mans toy or even hisloving companion but to use him for her ends</s> she dropped her chin till it hid the little dimplelike depressionbelow her throat which was one of her charms and began not to look atbut to study me seeing which i shut my eyes tight and waited</s>  evidentlyshe thought that i was still in my swoon for now she spoke to herselfin a low voice that was soft and sweet as honey</s>
a small man she said saduko would make two of him and theotherwho was he i wonderedthree</s>  his hair too is ugly he cutsit short and it sticks up like that on a cats back</s>  iya</s>  i</s> e</s> piff</s>  and she moved her hand contemptuously a feather of a man</s>  butwhitewhite one of those who rule</s>  why they all of them know that heis their master</s>  they call him hewhoneversleeps</s>  they say that hehas the courage of a lioness with younghe who got away when dingaankilled piti retief and the boers they say that he is quick andcunning as a snake and that panda and his great indunas think more ofhim than of any white man they know</s>  he is unmarried also though theysay too that twice he had a wife who died and now he does not turnto look at women which is strange in any man and shows that he willescape trouble and succeed</s>  still it must be remembered that they areall ugly down here in zululand cows or heifers who will be cows</s>  piff</s> no more</s> she paused for a little while then went on in her dreamy reflectivevoicenow if he met a woman who is not merely a cow or a heifer a womancleverer than himself even if she were not white i wonderat this point i thought it well to wake up</s>  turning my head i yawnedopened my eyes and looked at her vaguely seeing which her expressionchanged in a flash from that of brooding power to one of moved andanxious girlhood in short it became most sweetly feminine</s> you are mameena</s>  i said is it not so</s> oh yes inkoosi she answered that is my poor name</s>  but how did youhear it and how do you know me</s> i heard it from one sadukohere she frowned a littleand othersand i knew you because you are so beautifulan incautious speech atwhich she broke into a dazzling smile and tossed her deerlike head</s> am i</s>  she asked</s>  i never knew it who am only a common zulu girl towhom it pleases the great white chief to say kind things for which ithank him and she made a graceful little reverence just bendingone knee</s>  but she went on quickly whatever else i be i am of noknowledge not fit to tend you who are hurt</s>  shall i go and send myoldest mother</s> do you mean her whom your father calls the wornoutoldcow andwhose ear he shot off</s> yes it must be she from the description she answered with a littleshake of laughter though i never heard him give her that name</s> or if you did you have forgotten it i said dryly</s>  well i thinknot thank you</s>  why trouble her when you will do quite as well</s>  ifthere is milk in that gourd perhaps you will give me a drink of it</s> she flew to the bowl like a swallow and next moment was kneeling at myside and holding it to my lips with one hand while with the other shesupported my head</s> i am honoured she said</s>  i only came to the hut the moment beforeyou woke and seeing you still lost in swoon i weptlook my eyes arestill wet they were though how she made them so i do not knowfor ifeared lest that sleep should be but the beginning of the last</s> quite so i said it is very good of you</s>  and now since your fearsare groundlessthanks be to the heavenssit down if you will andtell me the story of how i came here</s> she sat down not i noted as a kafir woman ordinarily does in a kindof kneeling position but on a stool</s> you were carried into the kraal inkoosi she said on a litter ofboughs</s>  my heart stood still when i saw that litter coming it was nomore heart it was cold iron because i thought the dead or injured manwas and she paused</s> saduko</s>  i suggested</s> not at all inkoosimy father</s> well it wasnt either of them i said so you must have felt happy</s> happy</s>  inkoosi when the guest of our house had been wounded perhapsto deaththe guest of whom i have heard so much although by misfortunei was absent when he arrived</s> a difference of opinion with your eldest mother</s>  i suggested</s> yes inkoosi my own is dead and i am not too well treated here</s>  shecalled me a witch</s> did she</s>  i answered</s>  well i do not altogether wonder at it butplease continue your story</s> there is none inkoosi</s>  they brought you here they told me how theevil brute of a buffalo had nearly killed you in the pool that is all</s> yes yes mameena but how did i get out of the pool</s> oh it seems that your servant sikauli the bastard leapt into thewater and engaged the attention of the buffalo which was kneading youinto the mud while saduko got on to its back and drove his assegai downbetween its shoulders to the heart so that it died</s>  then they pulledyou out of the mud crushed and almost drowned with water and broughtyou to life again</s>  but afterwards you became senseless and so laywandering in your speech until this hour</s> ah he is a brave man is saduko</s> like others neither more nor less she replied with a shrug of herrounded shoulders</s>  would you have had him let you die</s>  i think thebrave man was he who got in front of the bull and twisted its nose nothe who sat on its back and poked at it with a spear</s> at this period in our conversation i became suddenly faint and lostcount of things even of the interesting mameena</s>  when i awoke again shewas gone and in her place was old umbezi who i noticed took downa mat from the side of the hut and folded it up to serve as a cushionbefore he sat himself upon the stool</s> greeting macumazahn he said when he saw that i was awake how areyou</s> as well as can be hoped i answered and how are you umbezi</s> oh bad macumazahn even now i can scarcely sit down for that bullhad a very hard nose also i am swollen up in front where sikauli struckme when he tumbled out of the tree</s>  also my heart is cut in two becauseof our losses</s> what losses umbezi</s> wow</s>  macumazahn the fire that those low fellows of mine lit got to ourcamp and burned up nearly everythingthe meat the skins and even theivory which it cracked so that it is useless</s>  that was an unlucky huntfor although it began so well we have come out of it quite naked yeswith nothing at all except the head of the bull with the cleft hornthat i thought you might like to keep</s> well umbezi let us be thankful that we have come out with ourlivesthat is if i am going to live i added</s> oh macumazahn you will live without doubt and be none the worse</s>  twoof our doctorsvery clever menhave looked at you and said so</s>  one ofthem tied you up in all those skins and i promised him a heifer for thebusiness if he cured you and gave him a goat on account</s>  but you mustlie here for a month or more so he says</s>  meanwhile panda has sent forthe hides which he demanded of me to be made into shields and i havebeen obliged to kill twentyfive of my beasts to provide themthat isof my own and of those of my headmen</s> then i wish you and your headmen had killed them before we met thosebuffalo umbezi i groaned for my ribs were paining me very much</s> send saduko and sikauli here i would thank them for saving my life</s> so they came next morning i think and i thanked them warmly enough</s> there there baas said scowl who was literally weeping tears of joyat my return from delirium and coma to the light of life and reason nottears of mameenas sort but real ones for i saw them running down hissnub nose that still bore marks of the eagles claws</s>  there theresay no more i beseech you</s>  if you were going to die i wished to dietoo who if you had left it should only have wandered through theworld without a heart</s>  that is why i jumped into the pool not because iam brave</s> when i heard this my own eyes grew moist</s>  oh it is the fashion to abusenatives but from whom do we meet with more fidelity and love than fromthese poor wild kafirs that so many of us talk of as black dirt whichchances to be fashioned to the shape of man</s> as for myself inkoosi added saduko i only did my duty</s>  how couldi have held up my head again if the bull had killed you while i walkedaway alive</s>  why the very girls would have mocked at me</s>  but oh hisskin was tough</s>  i thought that assegai would never get through it</s> observe the difference between these two mens characters</s>  the onealthough no hero in daily life imperils himself from sheer doglikefidelity to a master who had given him many hard words and sometimesa flogging in punishment for drunkenness and the other to gratify hispride also perhaps because my death would have interfered with hisplans and ambitions in which i had a part to play</s>  no that is a hardsaying still there is no doubt that saduko always first took his owninterests into consideration and how what he did would reflect uponhis prospects and repute or influence the attainment of his desires</s>  ithink this was so even when mameena was concernedat any rate in thebeginningalthough certainly he always loved her with a singleheartedpassion that is very rare among zulus</s> presently scowl left the hut to prepare me some broth whereon saduko atonce turned the talk to this subject of mameena</s> he understood that i had seen her</s>  did i not think her very beautiful</s> yes very beautiful i answered indeed the most beautiful zuluwoman i have ever seen</s> and very cleveralmost as clever as a white</s> yes and very clevermuch cleverer than most whites</s> andanything else</s> yes very dangerous and one who could turn like the wind and blow hotand blow cold</s> ah</s>  he said thought a while then added well what do i care howshe blows to others so long as she blows hot to me</s> well saduko and does she blow hot for you</s> not altogether macumazahn</s>  another pause</s>  i think she blows ratherlike the wind before a great storm</s> that is a biting wind saduko and when we feel it we know that thestorm will follow</s> i dare say that the storm will follow inkoosi for she was born in astorm and storm goes with her but what of that if she and i stand itout together</s>  i love her and i had rather die with her than live withany other woman</s> the question is saduko whether she would rather die with you thanlive with any other man</s>  does she say so</s> inkoosi mameenas thought works in the dark it is like a white ant inits tunnel of mud</s>  you see the tunnel which shows that she is thinkingbut you do not see the thought within</s>  still sometimes when shebelieves that no one beholds or hears herhere i bethought me of theyoung ladys soliloquy over my apparently senseless selfor when sheis surprised the true thought peeps out of its tunnel</s>  it did so theother day when i pleaded with her after she had heard that i killed thebuffalo with the cleft horn</s> do i love you</s>  she said</s>  i know not for sure</s>  how can i tell</s>  it isnot our custom that a maiden should love before she is married forif she did so most marriages would be things of the heart and not ofcattle and then half the fathers of zululand would grow poor and refuseto rear girlchildren who would bring them nothing</s>  you are brave youare handsome you are wellborn i would sooner live with you thanwith any other man i knowthat is if you were rich and better stillpowerful</s>  become rich and powerful saduko and i think that i shalllove you</s> i will mameena i answered but you must wait</s>  the zulu nation wasnot fashioned from nothing in a day</s>  first chaka had to come</s> ah</s>  she said and my father her eyes flashed</s>  ah</s>  chaka</s>  there wasa man</s>  be another chaka saduko and i will love you moremore than youcan dream ofthus and thus and she flung her arms about me and kissedme as i was never kissed before which as you know among us is astrange thing for a girl to do</s>  then she thrust me from her with alaugh and added as for the waiting you must ask my father of that</s> am i not his heifer to be sold and can i disobey my father</s>  and shewas gone leaving me empty for it seemed as though she took my vitalswith her</s>  nor will she talk thus any more the white ant who has goneback into its tunnel</s> and did you speak to her father</s> yes i spoke to him but in an evil moment for he had but just killedthe cattle to furnish pandas shields</s>  he answered me very roughly</s>  hesaid you see these dead beasts which i and my people must slay forthe king or fall under his displeasure</s>  well bring me five times theirnumber and we will talk of your marriage with my daughter who is amaid in some request</s> i answered that i understood and would try my best whereon he becamemore gentle for umbezi has a kindly heart</s> my son he said i like you well and since i saw you savemacumazahn my friend from that mad wild beast of a buffalo i likeyou better than before</s>  yet you know my case</s>  i have an old name andam called the chief of a tribe and many live on me</s>  but i am poor andthis daughter of mine is worth much</s>  such a woman few men have bred</s> well i must make the best of her</s>  my soninlaw must be one who willprop up my old age one to whom in my need or trouble i could alwaysgo as to a dry log to break off some of its bark to make a fire tocomfort me not one who treads me into the mire as the buffalo did tomacumazahn</s>  now i have spoken and i do not love such talk</s>  come backwith the cattle and i will listen to you but meanwhile understand thati am not bound to you or to anyone i shall take what my spirit sendsme which if i may judge the future by the past will not be much</s>  oneword more do not linger about this kraal too long lest it should besaid that you are the accepted suitor of mameena</s>  go hence and do amans work and return with a mans reward or not at all</s>   in zululand a soninlaw is known as isigodo so  mkwenyana the soninlaw log for the reason stated in  the text</s> editor</s> well saduko that spear has an edge on it has it not</s>  i answered</s> and now what is your plan</s> my plan is macumazahn he said rising from his seat to go henceand gather those who are friendly to me because i am my fathers sonand still the chief of the amangwane or those who are left of themalthough i have no kraal and no hoof of kine</s>  then within a moon ihope i shall return here to find you strong again and once more a manand we will start out against bangu as i have whispered to you withthe leave of a high one who has said that if i can take any cattle imay keep them for my pains</s> i dont know about that saduko</s>  i never promised you that i would makewar upon banguwith or without the kings leave</s> no you never promised but zikali the dwarf the wise little one saidthat you wouldand does zikali lie</s>  ask yourself who will remember acertain saying of his about a buffalo with a cleft horn a pool and adry riverbed</s>  farewell o my father macumazahn i walk with the dawnand i leave mameena in your keeping</s> you mean that you leave me in mameenas keeping i began but alreadyhe was crawling through the hole in the hut</s> well mameena kept me very comfortably</s>  she was always in evidence yetnot too much so</s> heedless of her malice and abuse she headed off the wornoutoldcowwhom she knew i detested from my presence</s>  she saw personally to mybandages as well as to the cooking of my food over which matter shehad several quarrels with the bastard scowl who did not like herfor on him she never wasted any of her sweet looks</s>  also as i grewstronger she sat with me a good deal talking since by commonconsent mameena the fair was exempted from all the field and eventhe ordinary household labours that fall to the lot of kafir women</s>  herplace was to be the ornament and i may add the advertisement of herfathers kraal</s>  others might do the work and she saw that they did it</s> we discussed all sorts of things from the christian and other religionsand european policy down for her thirst for knowledge seemed to beinsatiable</s>  but what really interested her was the state of affairs inzululand with which she knew i was well acquainted as a person whohad played a part in its history and who was received and trusted at thegreat house and as a white man who understood the designs and plans ofthe boers and of the governor of natal</s> now if the old king panda should chance to die she would ask mewhich of his sons did i think would succeed himumbelazi or cetewayoor another</s>  or if he did not chance to die which of them would he namehis heir</s> i replied that i was not a prophet and that she had better ask zikalithe wise</s> that is a very good idea she said only i have no one to take me tohim since my father would not allow me to go with saduko his ward</s> then she clapped her hands and added oh macumazahn will you take me</s> my father would trust me with you</s> yes i dare say i answered but the question is could i trustmyself with you</s> what do you mean</s>  she asked</s>  oh i understand</s>  then after all i ammore to you than a black stone to play with</s> i think it was that unlucky joke of mine which first set mameenathinking like a white ant in its tunnel as saduko said</s>  at leastafter it her manner towards me changed she became very deferentialshe listened to my words as though they were all wisdom i caught herlooking at me with her soft eyes as though i were quite an admirableobject</s>  she began to talk to me of her difficulties her troubles andher ambitions</s>  she asked me for my advice as to saduko</s>  on this pointi replied to her that if she loved him and her father would allow itpresumably she had better marry him</s> i like him well enough macumazahn although he wearies me at timesbut love oh tell me what is love</s>  then she clasped her slim handsand gazed at me like a fawn</s> upon my word young woman i replied that is a matter upon which ishould have thought you more competent to instruct me</s> oh macumazahn she said almost in a whisper and letting her headdroop like a fading lily you have never given me the chance haveyou</s>  and she laughed a little looking extremely attractive</s> good gracious</s> or rather its zulu equivalenti answered for ibegan to feel nervous</s>
 what do you mean mameena</s>  how could i therei stopped</s> i do not know what i mean macumazahn she exclaimed wildly buti know well enough what you meanthat you are white as snow and i amblack as soot and that snow and soot dont mix well together</s> no i answered gravely snow is good to look at and so is soot butmingled they make an ugly colour</s>
 not that you are like soot i addedhastily fearing to hurt her feelings</s>  that is your hueand i toucheda copper bangle she was wearinga very lovely hue mameena likeeverything else about you</s> lovely she said beginning to weep a little which upset me verymuch for if there is one thing i hate it is to see a woman cry</s>  howcan a poor zulu girl be lovely</s>  oh macumazahn the spirits have dealthardly with me who have given me the colour of my people and theheart of yours</s>  if i were white now what you are pleased to call thisloveliness of mine would be of some use to me for then then ohcannot you guess macumazahn</s> i shook my head and said that i could not and next moment was sorryfor she proceeded to explain</s> sinking to her kneesfor we were quite alone in the big hut and therewas no one else about all the other women being engaged on rural ordomestic tasks for which mameena declared she had no time as herbusiness was to look after meshe rested her shapely head upon my kneesand began to talk in a low sweet voice that sometimes broke into a sob</s> then i will tell youi will tell you yes even if you hate meafterwards</s>  i could teach you what love is very well macumazahn youare quite rightbecause i love you</s>  sob</s>  no you shall not stirtill you have heard me out</s>  here she flung her arms about my legs andheld them tight so that without using great violence it was absolutelyimpossible for me to move</s>  when i saw you first all shattered andsenseless snow seemed to fall upon my heart and it stopped for alittle while and has never been the same since</s>  i think that somethingis growing in it macumazahn that makes it big</s>  sob</s>  i used to likesaduko before that but afterwards i did not like him at allnonor masapo eitheryou know

knewnot what to say</s>  moreover i will confess my weaknessi was strangelymoved</s>  this beautiful girl with the fire in her heart this woman whowas different from all other women that i had ever known seemed to havetwisted her slender fingers into my heartstrings and to be drawingme towards her</s>  it was a great temptation and i bethought me of oldzikalis saying in the black kloof and seemed to hear his giant laugh</s> she glided up to me she threw her arms about me and kissed me on thelips and i think i kissed her back but really i am not sure what idid or said for my head

i wondered had she first made a fool of meand then thrown away the fruits of my folly</s>  to this hour i cannot quiteanswer the question though i believe the explanation to be that she didreally care for me and was anxious not to involve me in trouble and herplottings also she may have been wise enough to see that our natureswere as oil and water and would never blend</s> chapter v</s>  two bucks and the doeit may be thought that as a sequel to this somewhat remarkable scene inwhich i was absolutely bowled overperhaps bowled out would be a bettertermby a kafir girl who after bending me to her will had the geniusto drop me before i repented as she knew i would do so soon as her backwas turned thereby making me look the worst of fools that my relationswith that young lady would have been strained</s>  but not a bit of it</s>  whennext we met which was on the following morning she was just her easynatural self attending to my hurts which by now were almost welljoking about this and that inquiring as to the contents of certainletters which i had received from natal and of some newspapers thatcame with themfor on all such matters she was very curiousand soforth</s> impossible the clever critic will sayimpossible that a savage couldact with such finish</s>  well friend critic that is just where you arewrong</s>  when you come to add it up theres very little difference in allmain and essential matters between the savage and yourself</s> to begin with by what exact right do we call people like the zulussavages</s>  setting aside the habit of polygamy which after all iscommon among very highly civilised peoples in the east they have asocial system not unlike our own</s>  they have or had their king theirnobles and their commons</s>  they have an ancient and elaborate law anda system of morality in some ways as high as our own and certainly moregenerally obeyed</s>  they have their priests and their doctors they arestrictly upright and observe the rites of hospitality</s> where they differ from us mainly is that they do not get drunk until thewhite man teaches them so to do they wear less clothing the climatebeing more genial their towns at night are not disgraced by thesights that distinguish ours they cherish and are never cruel to theirchildren although they may occasionally put a deformed infant or a twinout of the way and when they go to war which is often they carry outthe business with a terrible thoroughness almost as terrible as thatwhich prevailed in every nation in europe a few generations ago</s> of course there remain their witchcraft and the cruelties which resultfrom their almost universal belief in the power and efficiency of magic</s> well since i lived in england i have been reading up this subject andi find that quite recently similar cruelties were practised throughouteuropethat is in a part of the world which for over a thousand yearshas enjoyed the advantages of the knowledge and profession of thechristian faith</s> now let him who is highly cultured take up a stone to throw at thepoor untaught zulu which i notice the most dissolute and drunkenwretch of a white man is often ready to do generally because he covetshis land his labour or whatever else may be his</s> but i wander from my point which is that a clever man or woman amongthe people whom we call savages is in all essentials very much the sameas a clever man or woman anywhere else</s> here in england every child is educated at the expense of the countrybut i have not observed that the system results in the production ofmore really able individuals</s>  ability is the gift of nature and thatuniversal mother sheds her favours impartially over all who breathe</s> no not quite impartially perhaps for the old greeks and others wereexamples to the contrary</s>  still the general rule obtains</s> to return</s>  mameena was a very able person as she chanced to be a verylovely one a person who had she been favoured by opportunity woulddoubtless have played the part of a cleopatra with equal or greatersuccess since she shared the beauty and the unscrupulousness of thatfamous lady and was i believe capable of her passion</s> i scarcely like to mention the matter since it affects myself andthe natural vanity of man makes him prone to conclude that he is theparticular object of sole and undying devotion</s>  could he know all thefacts of the case or cases probably he would be much undeceived andfeel about as small as i did when mameena walked or rather crawled outof the hut she could even crawl gracefully</s>  still to be honestandwhy should i not since all this business went beyond so longago</s> i do believe that there was a certain amount of truth in what shesaidthat for heaven knows what reason she did take a fancy to mewhich fancy continued during her short and stormy life</s>  but the readerof her story may judge for himself</s> within a fortnight of the day of my discomfiture in the hut i was quitewell and strong again my ribs or whatever part of me it was that thebuffalo had injured with his iron knees having mended up</s>  also i wasanxious to be going having business to attend to in natal and as nomore had been seen or heard of saduko i determined to trek homewardsleaving a message that he knew where to find me if he wanted me</s>  thetruth is that i was by no means keen on being involved in his privatewar with bangu</s>  indeed i wished to wash my hands of the whole matterincluding the fair mameena and her mocking eyes</s> so one morning having already got up my oxen i told scowl to inspantheman order which he received with joy for he and the other boyswished to be off to civilisation and its delights</s>  just as the operationwas beginning however a message came to me from old umbezi who beggedme to delay my departure till after noon as a friend of his a bigchief had come to visit him who wished much to have the honour ofmaking my acquaintance</s>  now i wished the big chief farther off but asit seemed rude to refuse the request of one who had been so kind to mei ordered the oxen to be unyoked but kept at hand and in an irritableframe of mind walked up to the kraal</s>  this was about half a mile frommy place of outspan for as soon as i was sufficiently recovered ihad begun to sleep in my wagon leaving the big hut to thewornoutoldcow</s> there was no particular reason why i should be irritated since timein those days was of no great account in zululand and it did not muchmatter to me whether i trekked in the morning or the afternoon</s>  but thefact was that i could not get over the prophecy of zikali the littleand wise that i was destined to share sadukos expedition againstbangu and although he had been right about the buffalo and mameena iwas determined to prove him wrong in this particular</s> if i had left the country obviously i could not go against bangu atany rate at present</s>  but while i remained in it saduko might return atany moment and then doubtless i should find it hard to escape fromthe kind of halfpromise that i had given to him</s> well as soon as i reached the kraal i saw that some kind of festivitywas in progress for an ox had been killed and was being cooked some ofit in pots and some by roasting also there were several strange zuluspresent</s>  within the fence of the kraal seated in its shadow i foundumbezi and some of his headmen and with them a great brawny ringednative who wore a tigerskin moocha as a mark of rank and some ofhis headmen</s>  also mameena was standing near the gate dressed in herbest beads and holding a gourd of kafir beer which evidently she hadjust been handing to the guests</s> would you have run away without saying goodbye to me macumazahn</s>  shewhispered to me as i came abreast of her</s>  that is unkind of you and ishould have wept much</s>  however it was not so fated</s> i was going to ride up and bid farewell when the oxen were inspannedi answered</s>  but who is that man</s> you will find out presently macumazahn</s>  look my father is beckoningto us</s> so i went on to the circle and as i advanced umbezi rose and taking meby the hand led me to the big man sayingthis is masapo chief of the amansomi of the quabe race who desiresto know you macumazahn</s> very kind of him i am sure i replied coolly as i threw my eye overmasapo</s>  he was as i have said a big man and of about fifty yearsof age for his hair was tinged with grey</s>  to be frank i took a greatdislike to him at once for there was something in his strong coarseface and his air of insolent pride which repelled me</s>  then i wassilent since among the zulus when two strangers of more or less equalrank meet he who speaks first acknowledges inferiority to the other</s> therefore i stood and contemplated this new suitor of mameena waitingon events</s> masapo also contemplated me then made some remark to one of hisattendants that i did not catch which caused the fellow to laugh</s> he has heard that you are an ipisi a great hunter broke in umbeziwho evidently felt that the situation was growing strained and that itwas necessary to say something</s> has he</s>  i answered</s>  then he is more fortunate than i am for i havenever heard of him or what he is</s>  this i am sorry to say was a fibfor it will be remembered that mameena had mentioned him in the hut asone of her suitors but among natives one must keep up ones dignitysomehow</s>  friend umbezi i went on i have come to bid you farewellas i am about to trek for durban</s> at this juncture masapo stretched out his great hand to me but withoutrising and saidsiyakubona that is goodday white man</s> siyakubona black man i answered just touching his fingers whilemameena who had come up again with her beer and was facing me made alittle grimace and tittered</s> now i turned on my heel to go whereon masapo said in a coarse growlingvoiceo macumazana before you leave us i wish to speak with you on a certainmatter</s>  will it please you to sit aside with me for a while</s> certainly o masapo</s>  and i walked away a few yards out of hearingwhither he followed me</s> macumazahn he said i give the gist of his remarks for he did notcome to the point at once i need guns and i am told that you canprovide them being a trader</s> yes masapo i dare say that i can at a price though it is a riskybusiness smuggling guns into zululand</s>  but might i ask what you needthem for</s>  is it to shoot elephants</s> yes to shoot elephants he replied rolling his big eyes round him</s> macumazahn i am told that you are discreet that you do not shoutfrom the top of a hut what you hear within it</s>  now hearken to me</s>  ourcountry is disturbed we do not all of us love the seed of senzangakonaof whom the present king panda is one</s>  for instance you may know thatwe quabiesfor my tribe the amansomi are of that racesuffered atthe spear of chaka</s>  well we think that a time may come when we who liveon shrubs like goats may again browse on treetops like giraffes forpanda is no strong king and he has sons who hate each other one ofwhom may need our spears</s>  do you understand</s> i understand that you want guns o masapo i answered dryly</s>  now asto the price and place of delivery</s> then we bargained for a while but the details of that businesstransaction of long ago will interest no one</s>  indeed i only mention thematter to show that masapo was plotting to bring trouble on the rulinghouse whereof panda was the representative at that time</s> when we had concluded our rather nefarious negotiations which were tothe effect that i was to receive so many cattle in return for so manyguns if i could deliver them at a certain spot namely umbezis kraali returned to the circle where umbezi his followers and guests weresitting purposing to bid him farewell</s>  by now however meat had beenserved and as i was hungry having had little breakfast that morningi stayed to eat</s>  when i had finished my meal and washed it down with adraught of tshwala that is kafir beer i rose to go but just at thatmoment who should walk through the gate but saduko</s> piff</s>  said mameena who was standing near me speaking in a voice thatnone but i could hear</s>  when two bucks meet what happens macumazahn</s> sometimes they fight and sometimes one runs away</s>  it depends very muchon the doe i answered in the same low voice looking at her</s> she shrugged her shoulders folded her arms beneath her breast noddedto saduko as he passed then leaned gracefully against the fence andawaited events</s> greeting umbezi said saduko in his proud manner</s>  i see that youfeast</s>  am i welcome here</s> of course you are always welcome saduko replied umbezi uneasilyalthough as it happens i am entertaining a great man</s>  and he lookedtowards masapo</s> i see said saduko eyeing the strangers</s>  but which of these may bethe great man</s>  i ask that i may salute him</s> you know well enough umfokazana that is low fellow exclaimedmasapo angrily</s> i know that if you were outside this fence masapo i would cram thatword down your throat at the point of my assegai replied saduko in afierce voice</s>  oh i can guess your business here masapo and you canguess mine and he glanced towards mameena</s>  tell me umbezi is thislittle chief of the amansomi your daughters accepted suitor</s> nay nay saduko said umbezi no one is her accepted suitor</s>  willyou not sit down and take food with us</s>  tell us where you have been andwhy you return here thus suddenly anduninvited</s> i return here o umbezi to speak with the white chief macumazahn</s>  asto where i have been that is my affair and not yours or masapos</s> now if i were chief of this kraal said masapo i would hunt out ofit this hyena with a mangy coat and without a hole who comes to devouryour meat and perhaps he added with meaning to steal away yourchild</s> did i not tell you macumazahn that when two bucks met they wouldfight</s>  whispered mameena suavely into my ear</s> yes mameena you didor rather i told you</s>  but you did not tell mewhat the doe would do</s> the doe macumazahn will crouch in her form and see what happensasis the fashion of does and again she laughed softly</s> why not do your own hunting masapo</s>  asked saduko</s>  come now iwill promise you good sport</s>  outside this kraal there are other hyenaswaiting who call me chiefa hundred or two of themassembled for acertain purpose by the royal leave of king panda whose house as we allknow you hate</s>  come leave that beef and beer and begin your hunting ofhyenas o masapo</s> now masapo sat silent for he saw that he who thought to snare a baboonhad caught a tiger</s> you do not speak o chief of the little amansomi went on saduko whowas beside himself with rage and jealousy</s>  you will not leave your beefand beer to hunt the hyenas who are captained by an umfokazana</s>  wellthen the umfokazana will speak and stepping up to masapo with thespear he carried poised in his right hand saduko grasped his rivalsshort beard with his left</s> listen chief he said</s>  you and i are enemies</s>  you seek the woman iseek and mayhap being rich you will buy her</s>  but if so i tell youthat i will kill you and all your house you sneaking halfbred dog</s> with these fierce words he spat in his face and tumbled him backwards</s> then before anyone could stop him for umbezi and even masaposheadmen seemed paralysed with surprise he stalked through the kraalgate saying as he passed meinkoosi i have words for you when you are at liberty</s> you shall pay for this roared umbezi after him turning almost greenwith rage for masapo still lay upon his broad back speechless youwho dare to insult my guest in my own house</s> somebody must pay cried back saduko from the gate but who it isonly the unborn moons will see</s> mameena i said as i followed him you have set fire to the grassand men will be burned in it</s> i meant to macumazahn she answered calmly</s>  did i not tell youthat there was a flame in me and it will break out sometimes</s>  butmacumazahn it is you who have set fire to the grass not i</s>  rememberthat when half zululand is in ashes</s>  farewell o macumazana till wemeet again and she added softly whoever else must burn may thespirits have you in their keeping</s> at the gate remembering my manners i turned to bid that company apolite farewell</s>  by now masapo had gained his feet and was roaring outlike a bullkill him</s>  kill the hyena</s>  umbezi will you sit still and see me yourguestme masapostruck and insulted under the shadow of your own hut</s> go forth and kill him i say</s> why not kill him yourself masapo asked the agitated umbezi orbid your headmen kill him</s>  who am i that i should take precedence ofso great a chief in a matter of the spear</s>  then he turned towards mesaying oh macumazahn the crafty if i have dealt well by you comehere and give me your counsel</s> i come eaterupofelephants i answered and i did</s> what shall i dowhat shall i do</s>  went on umbezi brushing theperspiration off his brow with one hand while he wrung the other in hisagitation</s>  there stands a friend of minehe pointed to the infuriatedmasapowho wishes me to kill another friend of mine and he jerkedhis thumb towards the kraal gate</s>  if i refuse i offend one friendand if i consent i bring blood upon my hands which will call for bloodsince although saduko is poor without doubt he has those who lovehim</s> yes i answered and perhaps you will bring blood upon other parts ofyourself besides your hands since saduko is not one to sit still like asheep while his throat is cut</s>  also did he not say that he is not quitealone</s>  umbezi if you will take my advice you will leave masapo to dohis own killing</s> it is good it is wise</s>  exclaimed umbezi</s>  masapo he called to thatwarrior if you wish to fight pray do not think of me</s>  i see nothingi hear nothing and i promise proper burial to any who fall</s>  only youhad best be swift for saduko is walking away all this time</s>  come youand your people have spears and the gate stands open</s> am i to go without my meat in order to knock that hyena on the head</s> asked masapo in a brave voice</s>  no he can wait my leisure</s>  sit stillmy people</s>  i tell you sit still</s>  tell him you macumazahn that i amcoming for him presently and be warned to keep yourself away from himlest you should tumble into his hole</s> i will tell him i answered though i know not who made me yourmessenger</s>  but listen to me you speaker of big words and doer ofsmall deeds if you dare to lift a finger against me i will teach yousomething about holes for there shall be one or more through that greatcarcass of yours</s> then walking up to him i looked him in the face and at the same timetapped the handle of the big doublebarrelled pistol i carried</s> he shrank back muttering something</s> oh dont apologise i said only be more careful in future</s>  andnow i wish you a good dinner chief masapo and peace upon your kraalfriend umbezi</s> after this speech i marched off followed by the clamour of masaposfurious attendants and the sound of mameenas light and mockinglaughter</s> i wonder which of them she will marry</s>  i thought to myself as i setout for the wagons</s> as i approached my camp i saw that the oxen were being inspanned as isupposed by the order of scowl who must have heard that there was a rowup at the kraal and thought it well to be ready to bolt</s>  in this i wasmistaken however for just then saduko strolled out of a patch of bushand saidi ordered your boys to yoke up the oxen inkoosi</s> have you</s>  thats cool</s>  i answered</s>  perhaps you will tell me why</s> because we must make a good trek to the northward before nightinkoosi</s> indeed</s>  i thought that i was heading southeast</s> bangu does not live in the south or the east he replied slowly</s> oh i had almost forgotten about bangu i said with a rather feebleattempt at evasion</s> is it so</s>  he answered in his haughty voice</s>  i never knew before thatmacumazahn was a man who broke a promise to his friend</s> would you be so kind as to explain your meaning saduko</s> is it needful</s>  he answered shrugging his shoulders</s>  unless my earsplayed me tricks you agreed to go up with me against bangu</s>  well ihave gathered the necessary menwith the kings leavethey await usyonder and he pointed with his spear towards a dense patch of bushthat lay some miles beneath us</s>  but he added if you desire tochange your mind i will go alone</s>  only then i think we had better bideach other goodbye since i love not friends who change their mindswhen the assegais begin to shake</s> now whether saduko spoke thus by design i do not know</s>  certainlyhowever he could have found no better way to ensure my companionshipfor what it was worth since although i had made no actual promise inthis case i have always prided myself on keeping even a halfbargainwith a native</s> i will go with you i said quietly and i hope that when it comes tothe pinch your spear will be as sharp as your tongue saduko</s>  only donot speak to me again like that lest we should quarrel</s> as i said this i saw a look of relief appear on his face of very greatrelief</s> i pray your pardon my lord macumazahn he said seizing my handbut oh</s>  there is a hole in my heart</s>  i think that mameena means toplay me false and now that has happened with yonder dog masapo whichwill make her father hate me</s> if you will take my advice saduko i replied earnestly you willlet this mameena fall out of the hole in your heart you will forget hername you will have done with her</s>  ask me not why</s> perhaps there is no need o macumazana</s>  perhaps she has been makinglove to you and you have turned her away as being what you are andmy friend of course you would do</s>  it is rather inconvenient to beset upon such a pedestal at times but i did not attempt to assent or todeny anything much less to enter into explanations</s> perhaps all this has happened he continued or perhaps it is she whohas sent for masapo the hog</s>  i do not ask because if you know you willnot tell me</s>  moreover it matters nothing</s>  while i have a heart mameenawill never drop out of it while i can remember names hers will neverbe forgotten by me</s>  moreover i mean that she shall be my wife</s>  now iam minded to take a few men and spear this hog masapo before we go upagainst bangu for then he at any rate will be out of my road</s> if you do anything of the sort saduko you will go up against bangualone for i trek east at once who will not be mixed up with murder</s> then let it be inkoosi unless he attacks me as my snake send thathe may the hog can wait</s>  after all he will only be growing a littlefatter</s>  now if it pleases you order the wagons to trek</s>  i will show theroad for we must camp in that bush tonight where my people waitme and there i will tell you my plans also you will find one with amessage for you</s>
chapter vi</s>  the ambushwe had reached the bush after six hours downhill trek over a pretty badtrack made by cattleof course there were no roads in zululand at thisdate</s>  i remember the place well</s>  it was a kind of spreading woodlandon a flat bottom where trees of no great size grew sparsely</s>  some weremimosa thorns others had deep green leaves and bore a kind of plum withan acid taste and a huge stone and others silvercoloured leaves intheir season</s>  a river too low at this time of the year wound throughit and in the scrub upon its banks were many guineafowl and otherbirds</s>  it was a pleasing lonely place with lots of game in it thatcame here in the winter to eat the grass which was lacking on thehigher veld</s>
 also it gave the idea of vastness since wherever onelooked there was nothing to be seen except a sea of trees</s> well we outspanned by the river of which i forget the name at a spotthat saduko showed us and set to work to cook our food that consistedof venison from a blue wildebeest one of a herd of these wildlookinganimals which i had been fortunate enough to shoot as they whisked pastus gambolling in and out between the trees</s> while we were eating i observed that armed zulus arrived continually inparties of from six to a score of men and as they arrived lifted theirspears though whether in salutation to saduko or to myself i didnot know and sat themselves down on an open space between us and theriverbank</s>  although it was difficult to say whence they came forthey appeared like ghosts out of the bush i thought it well to take nonotice of them since i guessed that their coming was prearranged</s> who are they</s>  i whispered to scowl as he brought me my tot ofsquareface</s> sadukos wild men he answered in the same low voice outlaws of histribe who live among the rocks</s> now i scanned them sideways while pretending to light my pipe and soforth and certainly they seemed a remarkably savage set of people</s> great gaunt fellows with tangled hair who wore tattered skins upontheir shoulders and seemed to have no possessions save some snuff a fewsleepingmats and an ample supply of large fighting shields hardwoodkerries or knobsticks and broad ixwas or stabbing assegais</s>  suchwas the look of them as they sat round us in silent semicircles likeaasvgelsas the dutch call vulturessit round a dying ox</s> still i smoked on and took no notice</s> at length as i expected saduko grew weary of my silence and spoke</s> these are men of the amangwane tribe macumazahn three hundred ofthem all that bangu left alive for when their fathers were killedthe women escaped with some of the children especially those of theoutlying kraals</s>  i have gathered them to be revenged upon bangu i whoam their chief by right of blood</s> quite so i answered</s>  i see that you have gathered them but do theywish to be revenged on bangu at the risk of their own lives</s> we do white inkoosi came the deepthroated answer from the threehundred</s> and do they acknowledge you saduko to be their chief</s> we do again came the answer</s>  then a spokesman stepped forward one ofthe few greyhaired men among them for most of these amangwane were ofthe age of saduko or even younger</s> o watcherbynight he said i am tshoza the brother of matiwanesadukos father the only one of his brothers that escaped the slaughteron the night of the great killing</s>  is it not so</s> it is so exclaimed the serried ranks behind him</s> i acknowledge saduko as my chief and so do we all went on tshoza</s> so do we all echoed the ranks</s> since matiwane died we have lived as we could o macumazana likebaboons among the rocks without cattle often without a hut to shelterus here one there one</s>  still we have lived awaiting the hour ofvengeance upon bangu that hour which zikali the wise who is of ourblood has promised to us</s>  now we believe that it has come and one andall from here from there from everywhere we have gathered at thesummons of saduko to be led against bangu and to conquer him or to die</s> is it not so amangwane</s> it is it is so</s>  came the deep unanimous answer that caused thestirless leaves to shake in the still air</s> i understand o tshoza brother of matiwane and uncle of saduko thechief i replied</s>  but bangu is a strong man living i am told in astrong place</s>  still let that go for have you not said that you comeout to conquer or to die you who have nothing to lose and if youconquer you conquer and if you die you die and the tale is told</s>  butsupposing that you conquer</s>  what will panda king of the zulus say toyou and to me also who stir up war in his country</s> now the amangwane looked behind them and saduko cried outappear messenger from panda the king</s> before his words had ceased to echo i saw a little withered manthreading his way between the tall gaunt forms of the amangwane</s>  hecame and stood before me sayinghail macumazahn</s>  do you remember me</s> aye i answered i remember you as maputa one of pandas indunas</s> quite so macumazahn i am maputa one of his indunas a member ofhis council a captain of his impis that is armies as i was to hisbrothers who are gone whose names it is not lawful that i should name</s> well panda the king has sent me to you at the request of saduko therewith a message</s> how do i know that you are a true messenger</s>  i asked</s>  have youbrought me any token</s> aye he answered and fumbling under his cloak he produced somethingwrapped in dried leaves which he undid and handed to me sayingthis is the token that panda sends to you macumazahn bidding meto tell you that you will certainly know it again also that you arewelcome to it since the two little bullets which he swallowed as youdirected made him very ill and he needs no more of them</s> i took the token and examining it in the moonlight recognised it atonce</s> it was a cardboard box of strong calomel pills on the top of which waswritten allan quatermain esq</s>  one only to be taken as directed</s> without entering into explanations i may state that i had taken one asdirected and subsequently presented the rest of the box to king pandawho was very anxious to taste the white mans medicine</s> do you recognise the token macumazahn</s>  asked the induna</s> yes i replied gravely and let the king return thanks to the spiritsof his ancestors that he did not swallow three of the balls for ifhe had done so by now there would have been another head in zululand</s> well speak on messenger</s> but to myself i reflected not for the first time how strangely thesenatives could mix up the sublime with the ridiculous</s>  here was a matterthat must involve the death of many men and the token sent to me by theautocrat who stood at the back of it all to prove the good faith of hismessenger was a box of calomel pills</s>  however it served the purpose aswell as anything else</s> maputa and i drew aside for i saw that he wished to speak with mealone</s> o macumazana he said when we were out of hearing of the othersthese are the words of panda to you i understand that youmacumazahn have promised to accompany saduko son of matiwane on anexpedition of his against bangu chief of the amakoba</s>  now were anyoneelse concerned i should forbid this expedition and especially should iforbid you a white man in my country to share therein</s>  but this dog ofa bangu is an evildoer</s>  many years ago he worked on the black one whowent before me to send him to destroy matiwane my friend fillingthe black ones ears with false accusations and thereafter he didtreacherously destroy him and all his tribe save saduko his son andsome of the people and children who escaped</s>  moreover of late he hasbeen working against me the king striving to stir up rebellion againstme because he knows that i hate him for his crimes</s>  now i pandaunlike those who went before me am a man of peace who do not wish tolight the fire of civil war in the land for who knows where such fireswill stop or whose kraals they will consume</s>  yet i do wish to see bangupunished for his wickedness and his pride abated</s>  therefore i givesaduko leave and those people of the amangwane who remain to himto avenge their private wrongs upon bangu if they can and i give youleave macumazahn to be of his party</s>  moreover if any cattle aretaken i shall ask no account of them you and saduko may divide them asyou wish</s>  but understand o macumazana that if you or your peopleare killed or wounded or robbed of your goods i know nothing of thematter and am not responsible to you or to the white house of natal itis your own matter</s>  these are my words</s>  i have spoken</s> i see i answered</s>  i am to pull pandas hot iron out of the fire andto extinguish the fire</s>  if i succeed i may keep a piece of the iron whenit gets cool and if i burn my fingers it is my own fault and i or myhouse must not come crying to panda</s> o watcherbynight you have speared the bull in the heart repliedmaputa the messenger nodding his shrewd old head</s>  well will you goup with saduko</s> say to the king o messenger that i will go up with saduko because ipromised him that i would being moved by the tale of his wrongs andnot for the sake of the cattle although it is true that if i hear anyof them lowing in my camp i may keep them</s>  say to panda also that ifaught of ill befalls me he shall hear nothing of it nor will i bringhis high name into this business but that he on his part must notblame me for anything that may happen afterwards</s>  have you the message</s> i have it word for word and may your spirit be with you macumazahnwhen you attack the strong mountain of bangu which were i you maputaadded reflectively i think i should do just at the dawn since theamakoba drink much beer and are heavy sleepers</s> then we took a pinch of snuff together and he departed at once fornodwengu pandas great place</s> fourteen days had gone by and saduko and i with our ragged band ofamangwane sat one morning after a long night march in the hillycountry looking across a broad vale which was sprinkled with trees likean english park at that mountain on the side of which bangu chief ofthe amakoba had his kraal</s> it was a very formidable mountain and as we had already observed thepaths leading up to the kraal were amply protected with stone walls inwhich the openings were quite narrow only just big enough to allow oneox to pass through them at a time</s>  moreover all these walls had beenstrengthened recently perhaps because bangu was aware that panda lookedupon him a northern chief dwelling on the confines of his dominionswith suspicion and even active enmity as he was also no doubt awarepanda had good cause to do</s> here in a dense patch of bush that grew in a kloof of the hills we helda council of war</s> so far as we knew our advance had been unobserved for i had left mywagons in the low veld thirty miles away giving it out among the localnatives that i was hunting game there and bringing on with me onlyscowl and four of my best hunters all wellarmed natives who couldshoot</s>  the three hundred amangwane also had advanced in small partiesseparated from each other pretending to be kafirs marching towardsdelagoa bay</s>  now however we had all met in this bush</s>  among our numberwere three amangwane who on the slaughter of their tribe had fled withtheir mothers to this district and been brought up among the people ofbangu but who at his summons had come back to saduko</s>  it was on thesemen that we relied at this juncture for they alone knew the country</s> long and anxiously did we consult with them</s>  first they explained andso far as the moonlight would allow for as yet the dawn had not brokenpointed out to us the various paths that led to bangus kraal</s> how many men are there in the town</s>  i asked</s> about seven hundred who carry spears they answered together withothers in outlying kraals</s>  moreover watchmen are always set at thegateways in the walls</s> and where are the cattle</s>  i asked again</s> here in the valley beneath macumazahn answered the spokesman</s>  ifyou listen you will hear them lowing</s>  fifty men not less watch them atnighttwo thousand head of them or more</s> then it would not be difficult to get round these cattle and drive themoff leaving bangu to breed up a new herd</s> it might not be difficult interrupted saduko but i came here tokill bangu as well as to seize his cattle since with him i have ablood feud</s> very good i answered but that mountain cannot be stormed with threehundred men fortified as it is with walls and schanzes</s>  our band wouldbe destroyed before ever we came to the kraal since owing to thesentries who are set everywhere it would be impossible to surprise theplace</s>  also you have forgotten the dogs saduko</s>  moreover even if itwere possible i will have nothing to do with the massacre of women andchildren which must happen in an assault</s>  now listen to me o saduko</s> i say let us leave the kraal of bangu alone and this coming night sendfifty of our men under the leadership of the guides down to yonderbush where they will lie hid</s>  then after moonrise when all areasleep these fifty must rush the cattle kraal killing any who mayoppose them should they be seen and driving the herd out throughyonder great pass by which we have entered the land</s>  bangu and hispeople thinking that those who have taken the cattle are but commonthieves of some wild tribe will gather and follow the beasts torecapture them</s>  but we with the rest of the amangwane can set anambush in the narrowest part of the pass among the rocks where thegrass is high and the euphorbia trees grow thick and there when theyhave passed the nek which i and my hunters will hold with our guns wewill give them battle</s>  what say you</s> now saduko answered that he would rather attack the kraal which hewished to burn</s>  but the old amangwane tshoza brother of the deadmatiwane saidno macumazahn watcherbynight is wise</s>  why should we waste ourstrength on stone walls of which none know the number or can find thegates in the darkness and thereby leave our skulls to be set up asornaments on the fences of the accursed amakoba</s>  let us draw the amakobaout into the pass of the mountains where they have no walls to protectthem and there fall on them when they are bewildered and settlethe matter with them man to man</s>  as for the women and children withmacumazahn i say let them go afterwards perhaps they will becomeour women and children</s> aye answered the amangwane the plan of the white inkoosi is goodhe is clever as a weasel we will have his plan and no other</s> so saduko was overruled and my counsel adopted</s> all that day we rested lighting no fires and remaining still as thedead in the dense bush</s>  it was a very anxious day for although theplace was so wild and lonely there was always the fear lest we shouldbe discovered</s>  it was true that we had travelled mostly by night insmall parties to avoid leaving a spoor and avoided all kraals stillsome rumour of our approach might have reached the amakoba or a partyof hunters might stumble on us or those who sought for lost cattle</s> indeed something of this sort did happen for about midday we heard afootfall and perceived the figure of a man whom by his headdress weknew for an amakoba threading his way through the bush</s>  before he sawus he was in our midst</s>  for a moment he hesitated ere he turned to flyand that moment was his last for three of the amangwane leapt on himsilently as leopards leap upon a buck and where he stood there he died</s> poor fellow</s>  evidently he had been on a visit to some witchdoctor forin his blanket we found medicine and love charms</s>  this doctor cannothave been one of the stamp of zikali the dwarf i thought to myselfat least he had not warned him that he would never live to dose hisbeloved with that foolish medicine</s> meanwhile a few of us who had the quickest eyes climbed trees andthence watched the town of bangu and the valley that lay between us andit</s>  soon we saw that so far at any rate fortune was playing into ourhands since herd after herd of kine were driven into the valley duringthe afternoon and enclosed in the stockkraals</s>  doubtless bangu intendedon the morrow to make his halfyearly inspection of all the cattle ofthe tribe many of which were herded at a distance from his town</s> at length the long day drew to its close and the shadows of the eveningthickened</s>  then we made ready for our dreadful game of which the stakewas the lives of all of us since should we fail we could expect nomercy</s>  the fifty picked men were gathered and ate food in silence</s> these men were placed under the command of tshoza for he was the mostexperienced of the amangwane and led by the three guides who had dweltamong the amakoba and who knew every antheap in the land or sothey swore</s>  their duty it will be remembered was to cross the valleyseparate themselves into small parties unbar the various cattle kraalskill or hunt off the herdsmen and drive the beasts back across thevalley into the pass</s>  a second fifty men under the command of sadukowere to be left just at the end of this pass where it opened out intothe valley in order to help and reinforce the cattlelifters or ifneed be to check the following amakoba while the great herds of beastswere got away and then fall back on the rest of us in our ambush nearlytwo miles distant</s>  the management of this ambush was to be my chargeaheavy one indeed</s> now the moon would not be up till midnight</s>  but two hours before thattime we began our moves since the cattle must be driven out of thekraals as soon as she appeared and gave the needful light</s>  otherwisethe fight in the pass would in all probability be delayed till aftersunrise when the amakoba would see how small was the number of theirfoes</s>  terror doubt darknessthese must be our allies if our desperateventure was to succeed</s> all was arranged at last and the time had come</s>  we the three captainsof our divided force bade each other farewell and passed the worddown the ranks that should we be separated by the accidents of war mywagons were the meetingplace of any who survived</s> tshoza and his fifty glided away into the shadow silently as ghostsand were gone</s>  presently the fiercefaced saduko departed also withhis fifty</s>  he carried the doublebarrelled gun i had given him andwas accompanied by one of my best hunters a natal native who was alsoarmed with a heavy smoothbore loaded with slugs</s>  our hope was that thesound of these guns might terrify the foe should there be occasion touse them before our forces joined up again and make them think theyhad to do with a body of raiding dutch white men of whose roersasthe heavy elephant guns of that day were calledall natives were muchafraid</s> so saduko went with his fifty leaving me wondering whether i shouldever see his face again</s>  then i my bearer scowl the two remaininghunters and the ten score amangwane who were left turned and soon werefollowing the road by which we had come down the rugged pass</s>  i callit a road but in fact it was nothing but a waterwashed gully strewnwith boulders through which we must pick our way as best we could inthe darkness having first removed the percussion cap from the nipple ofevery gun for fear lest the accidental discharge of one of them shouldwarn the amakoba confuse our other parties and bring all our deeplaidplans to nothing</s> well we accomplished that march somehow walking in three long linesso that each man might keep touch with him in front and just as themoon began to rise reached the spot that i had chosen for the ambush</s> certainly it was well suited to that purpose</s>  here the track or gullybed narrowed to a width of not more than a hundred feet while the steepslopes of the kloof on either side were clothed with scattered bushesand fingerlike euphorbias which grew among stones</s>  behind these stonesand bushes we hid ourselves a hundred men on one side and a hundred onthe other whilst i and my three hunters who were armed with guns tookup a position under shelter of a great boulder nearly five feet thickthat lay but a little to the right of the gully itself up which weexpected the cattle would come</s>  this place i chose for two reasonsfirst that i might keep touch with both wings of my force andsecondly that we might be able to fire straight down the path on thepursuing amakoba</s> these were the orders that i gave to the amangwane warning them that hewho disobeyed would be punished with death</s>  they were not to stir untili or if i should be killed one of my hunters fired a shot for myfear was lest growing excited they might leap out before the time andkill some of our own people who very likely would be mixed up with thefirst of the pursuing amakoba</s>  secondly when the cattle had passed andthe signal had been given they were to rush on the amakoba throwingthemselves across the gully so that the enemy would have to fightupwards on a steep slope</s> that was all i told them since it is not wise to confuse natives bygiving too many orders</s>  one thing i added howeverthat they mustconquer or they must die</s>  there was no mercy for them it was a caseof death or victory</s>  their spokesmanfor these people always finda spokesmananswered that they thanked me for my advice that theyunderstood and that they would do their best</s>  then they lifted theirspears to me in salute</s>  a wild lot of men they looked in the moonlightas they departed to take shelter behind the rocks and trees and wait</s> that waiting was long and i confess that before the end it got uponmy nerves</s>  i began to think of all sorts of things such as whetheri should live to see the sun rise again also i reflected upon thelegitimacy of this remarkable enterprise</s>  what right had i to involvemyself in a quarrel between these savages</s> why had i come here</s>  to gain cattle as a trader</s>  no for i was not atall sure that i would take them if gained</s>  because saduko had twitted mewith faithlessness to my words</s>  yes to a certain extent but that wasby no means the whole reason</s>  i had been moved by the recital of thecruel wrongs inflicted upon saduko and his tribe by this bangu andtherefore had not been loath to associate myself with his attemptedvengeance upon a wicked murderer</s>  well that was sound enough so faras it went but now a new consideration suggested itself to me</s>  thosewrongs had been worked many years ago probably most of the men who hadaided and abetted them by now were dead or very aged and it was theirsons upon whom the vengeance would be wreaked</s> what right had i to assist in visiting the sins of the fathers upon thesons</s>  frankly i could not say</s>  the thing seemed to me to be a part ofthe problem of life neither less nor more</s>  so i shrugged my shoulderssadly and consoled myself by reflecting that very likely the issue wouldgo against me and that my own existence would pay the price of theventure and expound its moral</s>  this consideration soothed my consciencesomewhat for when a man backs his actions with the risk of his liferight or wrong at any rate he plays no cowards part</s> the time went by very slowly and nothing happened</s>  the waning moon shonebrightly in a clear sky and as there was no wind the silence seemedpeculiarly intense</s>  save for the laugh of an occasional hyena and nowand again for a sound which i took for the coughing of a distant lionthere was no stir between sleeping earth and moonlit heaven in whichlittle clouds floated beneath the pale stars</s> at length i thought that i heard a noise a kind of murmur far away</s>  itgrew it developed</s> it sounded like a thousand sticks tapping upon something hard veryfaintly</s>  it continued to grow and i knew the sound for that of thebeating hoofs of animals galloping</s>  then there were isolated noisesvery faint and thin they might be shouts then something that i couldnot mistakeshots fired at a distance</s>  so the business was afoot thecattle were moving saduko and my hunter were firing</s>  there was nothingfor it but to wait</s> the excitement was very fierce it seemed to consume me to eat intomy brain</s>  the sound of the tapping upon the rocks grew louder untilit merged into a kind of rumble mixed with an echo as of that of verydistant thunder which presently i knew to be not thunder but thebellowing of a thousand frightened beasts</s> nearer and nearer came the galloping hoofs and the rumble of bellowingsnearer and nearer the shouts of men affronting the stillness of thesolemn night</s>  at length a single animal appeared a koodoo buck thatsomehow had got mixed up with the cattle</s>  it went past us like a flashand was followed a minute or so later by a bull that being young andlight had outrun its companions</s>  that too went by foam on its lipsand its tongue hanging from its jaws</s> then the herd appeareda countless herd it seemed to meplunging upthe inclinecows heifers calves bulls and oxen all mixed togetherin one inextricable mass and every one of them snorting bellowingor making some other kind of sound</s>  the din was fearful the sightbewildering for the beasts were of all colours and their long hornsflashed like ivory in the moonlight</s>  indeed the only thing in the leastlike it which i have ever seen was the rush of the buffaloes from thereed camp on that day when i got my injury</s> they were streaming past us now a mighty and moving mass so closelypacked that a man might have walked upon their backs</s>  in fact some ofthe calves which had been thrust up by the pressure were being carriedalong in this fashion</s>  glad was i that none of us were in their pathfor their advance seemed irresistible</s>  no fence or wall could have savedus and even stout trees that grew in the gully were snapped or thrustover</s> at length the long line began to thin for now it was composed ofstragglers and weak or injured beasts of which there were many</s>  othersounds too began to dominate the bellowings of the animals thoseof the excited cries of men</s>  the first of our companions thecattlelifters appeared weary and gasping but waving their spears intriumph</s>  among them was old tshoza</s>  i stepped upon my rock calling tohim by name</s>  he heard me and presently was lying at my side panting</s> we have got them all</s>  he gasped</s>  not a hoof is left save thosethat are trodden down</s>  saduko is not far behind with the rest of ourbrothers except some that have been killed</s>  all the amakoba tribe areafter us</s>  he holds them back to give the cattle time to get away</s> well done</s>  i answered</s>  it is very good</s>  now make your men hide amongthe others that they may find their breath before the fight</s> so he stopped them as they came</s>  scarcely had the last of them vanishedinto the bushes when the gathering volume of shouts amongst which iheard a gun go off told us that saduko and his band and the pursuingamakoba were not far away</s>  presently they too appearedthat is thehandful of amangwane didnot fighting now but running as hard as theycould for they knew they were approaching the ambush and wished to passit so as not to be mixed up with the amakoba</s>  we let them go through us</s> among the last of them came saduko who was wounded for the blood randown his side supporting my hunter who was also wounded more severelyas i feared</s> i called to him</s> saduko i said halt at the crest of the path and rest there so thatyou may be able to help us presently</s> he waved the gun in answer for he was too breathless to speak andwent on with those who were left of his followingperhaps thirty men inallin the track of the cattle</s>  before he was out of sight theamakoba arrived a mob of five or six hundred men mixed up togetherand advancing without order or discipline for they seemed to have losttheir heads as well as their cattle</s>  some of them had shields and somehad none some broad and some throwing assegais while many were quitenaked not having stayed to put on their moochas and much less their warfinery</s>  evidently they were mad with rage for the sounds that issuedfrom them seemed to concentrate into one mighty curse</s> the moment had come though to tell the truth i heartily wished thatit had not</s>  i wasnt exactly afraid although i never set up for greatcourage but i did not quite like the business</s>  after all we werestealing these peoples cattle and now were going to kill as manyof them as we could</s>  i had to recall sadukos dreadful story of themassacre of his tribe before i could make up my mind to give thesignal</s>  that hardened me and so did the reflection that after all theyoutnumbered us enormously and very likely would prove victors in theend</s>  anyhow it was too late to repent</s>  what a tricky and uncomfortablething is conscience that nearly always begins to trouble us at themoment of or after the event not before when it might be of someuse</s> i raised myself upon the rock and fired both barrels of my gun into theadvancing horde though whether i killed anyone or no i cannot say</s>  ihave always hoped that i did not but as the mark was large and i am afair shot i fear that is scarcely possible</s>  next moment with a howlthat sounded like that of wild beasts from either side of the gorge thefierce amangwane freespearsfor that is what they wereleapt out oftheir hidingplaces and hurled themselves upon their hereditary foes</s> they were fighting for more than cattle they were fighting for hate andfor revenge since these amakoba had slaughtered their fathers and theirmothers their sisters and their brothers and they alone remained topay them back blood for blood</s> great heaven</s>  how they did fight more like devils than human beings</s> after that first howl which shaped itself to the word saduko theywere silent as bulldogs</s>  though they were so few at first theirterrible rush drove back the amakoba</s>  then as these recovered fromtheir surprise the weight of numbers began to tell for they too werebrave men who did not give way to panic</s>  scores of them went down atonce but the remainder pushed the amangwane before them up the hill</s>  itook little share in the fight but was thrust backward with the othersonly firing when i was obliged to save my own life</s>  foot by foot we werepushed back till at length we drew near to the crest of the pass</s> then while the issue hung in the balance there was another shout ofsaduko</s>  and that chief himself followed by his thirty rushed uponthe amakoba</s> this charge decided the battle for not knowing how many more werecoming those who were left of the amakoba turned and fled nor did wepursue them far</s> we mustered on the hilltop not more than two hundred of us now therest were fallen or desperately wounded my poor hunter whom i had lentto saduko being among the dead</s>  although wounded he died fighting tothe last then fell down shouting to mechief have i done well</s>  and expired</s> i was breathless and spent but as in a dream i saw some amangwane dragup a gaunt old savage cryinghere is bangu bangu the butcher whom we have caught alive</s> saduko stepped up to him</s> ah</s>  bangu he said now say why should i not kill you as you wouldhave killed the little lad saduko long ago had not zikali saved him</s> see here is the mark of your spear</s> kill said bangu</s>  your spirit is stronger than mine</s>  did not zikaliforetell it</s>  kill saduko</s> nay answered saduko</s>  if you are weary i am weary too and woundedas well</s>  take a spear bangu and we will fight</s> so they fought there in the moonlight man to man fought fiercely whileall watched till presently i saw bangu throw his arms wide and fallbackwards</s> saduko was avenged</s>  i have always been glad that he slew his enemy thusand not as it might have been expected that he would do</s> chapter vii</s>  saduko brings the marriage giftwe reached my wagons in the early morning of the following day bringingwith us the cattle and our wounded</s>  thus encumbered it was a mosttoilsome march and an anxious one also for it was always possible thatthe remnant of the amakoba might attempt pursuit</s>  this however theydid not do for very many of them were dead or wounded and those whoremained had no heart left in them</s>  they went back to their mountainhome and lived there in shame and wretchedness for i do not believethere were fifty head of cattle left among the tribe and kafirs withoutcattle are nothing</s>  still they did not starve since there were plentyof women to work the fields and we had not touched their corn</s>  theend of them was that panda gave them to their conqueror saduko and heincorporated them with the amangwane</s>  but that did not happen until sometime afterwards</s> when we had rested a while at the wagons the captured beasts weremustered and on being counted were found to number a little over twelvehundred head not reckoning animals that had been badly hurt in theflight which we killed for beef</s>  it was a noble prize truly andnotwithstanding the wound in his thigh which hurt him a good deal nowthat it had stiffened saduko stood up and surveyed them with glisteningeyes</s>  no wonder for he who had been so poor was now rich and wouldremain so even after he had paid over whatever number of cows umbezichose to demand as the price of mameenas hand</s>  moreover he was sureand i shared his confidence that in these changed circumstances boththat young woman and her father would look upon his suit with veryfavourable eyes</s>  he had so to speak succeeded to the title and thefamily estates by means of a lawsuit brought in the court of theassegai and therefore there was hardly a father in zululand who wouldshut his kraal gate upon him</s>  we forgot both of us the proverb thatpoints out how numerous are the slips between the cup and the lipwhich by the way is one that has its zulu equivalents</s>  one of them ifi remember right at the moment is however loud the hen cackles thehousewife does not always get the egg</s> as it chanced although sadukos hen was cackling very loudly just atthis time he was not destined to find the coveted egg</s>  but of thatmatter i will speak in its place</s> i too looked at those cattle wondering whether saduko would rememberour bargain under which some six hundred head of them belonged to me</s> six hundred head</s>  why putting them at 5 apiece all roundand as oxenwere very scarce just at that time they were worth quite as much ifnot morethat meant 3000 a larger sum of money than i had ever ownedat one time in all my life</s>  truly the paths of violence were profitable</s> but would he remember</s>  on the whole i thought probably not since kafirsare not fond of parting with cattle</s> well i did him an injustice for presently he turned and said withsomething of an effortmacumazahn half of all these belong to you and truly you have earnedthem for it was your cunning and good counsel that gained us thevictory</s>  now we will choose them beast by beast</s> so i chose a fine ox then saduko chose one and so it went on till ihad eight of my number driven out</s>  as the eighth was taken i turned tosaduko and saidthere that will do</s>  these oxen i must have to replace those in myteams which died on the trek but i want no more</s> wow</s>  said saduko and all those who stood with him while one of themaddedi think it was old tshozahe refuses six hundred cattle which are fairly his</s>  he must be mad</s> no friends i answered i am not mad but neither am i bad</s>  iaccompanied saduko on this raid because he is dear to me and stood byme once in the hour of danger</s>  but i do not love killing men with whom ihave no quarrel and i will not take the price of blood</s> wow</s>  said old tshoza again for saduko seemed too astonished to speakhe is a spirit not a man</s>  he is holy</s> not a bit of it i answered</s>  if you think that ask mameenaa darksaying which they did not understand</s>  now listen</s>  i will not takethose cattle because i do not think as you kafirs think</s>  but as they aremine according to your law i am going to dispose of them</s>  i give tenhead to each of my hunters and fifteen head to the relations of himwho was killed</s>  the rest i give to tshoza and to the other men ofthe amangwane who fought with us to be divided among them in suchproportions as they may agree i being the judge in the event of anyquarrel arising</s> now these men raised a great cry of inkoosi</s>  and running up oldtshoza seized my hand and kissed it</s> your heart is big he cried you drop fatness</s>  although you areso small the spirit of a king lives in you and the wisdom of theheavens</s> thus he praised me while all the others joined in till the din wasawful</s>  saduko thanked me also in his magnificent manner</s>  yet i do notthink that he was altogether pleased although my great gift relievedhim from the necessity of sharing up the spoil with his companions</s> the truth was or so i believe that he understood that henceforth theamangwane would love me better than they loved him</s>  this indeed provedto be the case for i am sure that there was no man among all those wildfellows who would not have served me to the death and to this day myname is a power among them and their descendants</s>  also it has grown intosomething of a proverb among all those kafirs who know the story</s> they talk of any great act of liberality in an idiom as a gift ofmacumazana and in the same way of one who makes any remarkablerenunciation as a wearer of macumazanas blanket or as he who hasstolen macumazanas shadow</s> thus did i earn a great reputation very cheaply for really i could nothave taken those cattle also i am sure that had i done so they wouldhave brought me bad luck</s>  indeed one of the regrets of my life is thati had anything whatsoever to do with the business</s> our journey back to umbezis kraalfor thither we were headingwasvery slow hampered as we were with wounded and by a vast herd ofcattle</s>  of the latter indeed we got rid after a while for exceptthose which i had given to my men and a hundred or so of the bestbeasts that saduko took with him for a certain purpose they were sentaway to a place which he had chosen in charge of about half of hispeople under the command of his uncle tshoza there to await hiscoming</s> over a month had gone by since the night of the ambush when at last weoutspanned quite close to umbezis in that bush where first i had metthe amangwane freespears</s>  a very different set of men they looked onthis triumphant day to those fierce fellows who had slipped out of thetrees at the call of their chief</s>  as we went through the country sadukohad bought fine moochas and blankets for them also headdresses hadbeen made with the long black feathers of the sakabuli finch andshields and leglets of the hides and tails of oxen</s>  moreover having fedplentifully and travelled easily they were fat and wellfavoured asgiven good food natives soon become after a period of abstinence</s> the plan of saduko was to lie quiet in the bush that night and on thefollowing morning to advance in all his grandeur accompanied by hisspears present the hundred head of cattle that had been demanded andformally ask his daughters hand from umbezi</s>  as the reader may havegathered already there was a certain histrionic vein in saduko alsowhen he was in feather he liked to show off his plumage</s> well this plan was carried out to the letter</s>  on the following morningafter the sun was well up saduko as a great chief does sent forwardtwo bedizened heralds to announce his approach to umbezi after whomfollowed two other men to sing his deeds and praises</s>  by the way iobserved that they had clearly been instructed to avoid any mention of aperson called macumazahn</s>  then we advanced in force</s>  first went sadukosplendidly apparelled as a chief carrying a small assegai and adornedwith plumes leglets and a leopardskin kilt</s>  he was attended byabout half a dozen of the bestlooking of his followers who posed asindunas or councillors</s>  behind these i walked a dusty insignificantlittle fellow attended by the ugly snubnosed scowl in a very greasypair of trousers wornout european boots through which his toes peepedand nothing else and by my three surviving hunters whose appearancewas even more disreputable</s>  after us marched about four score of thetransformed amangwane and after them came the hundred picked cattledriven by a few herdsmen</s> in due course we arrived at the gate of the kraal where we found theheralds and the praisers prancing and shouting</s> have you seen umbezi</s>  asked saduko of them</s> no they answered he was asleep when we got here but his people saythat he is coming out presently</s> then tell his people that he had better be quick about it or i shallturn him out replied the proud saduko</s> just at this moment the kraal gate opened and through it appearedumbezi looking extremely fat and foolish also it struck mefrightened although this he tried to conceal</s> who visits me here he said with so muchumceremony</s>  and withthe carved dancingstick he carried he pointed doubtfully at the linesof armed men</s>
 oh it is you is it saduko</s>  and he looked him upand down adding how grand you are to be sure</s>  have you been robbinganybody</s>  and you too macumazahn</s>  well you do not look grand</s>  youlook like an old cow that has been suckling two calves on the winterveld</s>  but tell me what are all these warriors for</s>  i ask because i havenot food for so many especially as we have just had a feast here</s> fear nothing umbezi answered saduko in his grandest manner</s>  i havebrought food for my own men</s>  as for my business it is simple</s>  you askeda hundred head of cattle as the lobola that is the marriage gift ofyour daughter mameena</s>  they are there</s>  go send your servants to thekraal and count them</s> oh with pleasure umbezi replied nervously and he gave some ordersto certain men behind him</s>  i am glad to see that you have become richin this sudden fashion saduko though how you have done so i cannotunderstand</s> never mind how i have become rich answered saduko</s>  i am rich thatis enough for the present</s>  be pleased to send for mameena for i wouldtalk with her</s> yes yes saduko i understand that you would talk with mameenabutand he looked round him desperatelyi fear that she is stillasleep</s>  as you know mameena was always a late riser and what is moreshe hates to be disturbed</s>  dont you think that you could come backsay tomorrow morning</s>  she will be sure to be up by then or betterstill the day after</s> in which hut is mameena</s>  asked saduko sternly while i smelling arat began to chuckle to myself</s> i really do not know saduko replied umbezi</s>  sometimes she sleeps inone sometimes in another and sometimes she goes several hours journeyaway to her aunts kraal for a change</s>  i should not be in the leastsurprised if she had done so last night</s>  i have no control overmameena</s> before saduko could answer a shrill rasping voice broke upon our earswhich after some search i saw proceeded from an ugly and ancient femaleseated in the shadow in whom i recognised the lady who was known by thepleasing name of wornoutoldcow</s> he lies</s>  screeched the voice</s>  he lies</s>  thanks be to the spirit of myancestors that wild cat mameena has left this kraal for good</s>  she sleptlast night not with her aunt but with her husband masapo to whomumbezi gave her in marriage two days ago receiving in payment ahundred and twenty head of cattle which was twenty more than you bidsaduko</s> now when saduko heard these words i thought that he would really gomad with rage</s>  he turned quite grey under his dark skin and for a whiletrembled like a leaf looking as though he were about to fall to theground</s>  then he leapt as a lion leaps and seizing umbezi by the throathurled him backwards standing over him with raised spear</s> you dog</s>  he cried in a terrible voice</s>  tell me the truth or i willrip you up</s>  what have you done with mameena</s> oh</s>  saduko answered umbezi in choking tones mameena has chosen toget married</s>  it was no fault of mine she would have her way</s> he got no farther and had i not intervened by throwing my arms aboutsaduko and dragging him back that moment would have been umbezislast for saduko was about to pin him to the earth with his spear</s>  as itproved i was just in time and saduko being weak with emotion for ifelt his heart going like a sledgehammer could not break from my graspbefore his reason returned to him</s> at length he recovered himself a little and threw down his spear asthough to put himself out of temptation</s>  then he spoke always in thesame terrible voice askinghave you more to say about this business umbezi</s>  i would hear allbefore i answer you</s> only this saduko replied umbezi who had risen to his feet and wasshaking like a reed</s>  i did no more than any other father would havedone</s>  masapo is a very powerful chief one who will be a good stick forme to lean on in my old age</s>  mameena declared that she wished to marryhimhe lies</s>  screeched the old cow</s>  what mameena said was that she hadno will towards marriage with any zulu in the land so i suppose she islooking after a white man and she leered in my direction</s>  she saidhowever that if her father wished to marry her to masapo she must bea dutiful daughter and obey him but that if blood and trouble came ofthat marriage let it be on his head and not on hers</s> would you also stick your claws into me cat</s>  shouted umbezi catchingthe old woman a savage cut across the back with the light dancingstickwhich he still held in his hand whereon she fled away screeching andcursing him</s> oh saduko he went on let not your ears be poisoned by thesefalsehoods</s>  mameena never said anything of the sort or if she did itwas not to me</s>  well the moment that my daughter had consented to takemasapo as her husband his people drove a hundred and twenty of the mostbeautiful cattle over the hill and would you have had me refuse themsaduko</s>  i am sure that when you have seen them you will say that iwas quite right to accept such a splendid lobola in return for onesharptongued girl</s>  remember saduko that although you had promised ahundred head that is less by twenty at the time you did not own oneand where you were to get them from i could not guess</s>  moreover headded with a last desperate imaginative effort for i think he sawthat his arguments were making no impression some strangers who calledhere told me that both you and macumazahn had been killed by certainevildoers in the mountains</s>  there i have spoken and saduko if younow have cattle why on my part i have another daughter not quite sogoodlooking perhaps but a much better worker in the field</s>  come anddrink a sup of beer and i will send for her</s> stop talking about your other daughter and your beer and listen to mereplied saduko looking at the assegai which he had thrown to the groundso ominously that i set my foot on it</s>  i am now a greater chiefthan the boar masapo</s>  has masapo such a bodyguard as theseeatersupofenemies</s>  and he jerked his thumb backwards towards theserried lines of fiercefaced amangwane who stood listening behind us</s> has masapo as many cattle as i have whereof those which you see arebut a tithe brought as a lobola gift to the father of her

not desire tomix up with my quarrels i would bid my men take you and beat you todeath with the handles of their spears and then go on and serve theboar in the same fashion in his mountain sty</s>  as it is these thingsmust wait a little while especially as i have other matters to attendto first</s>  yet the day is not far off when i will attend to them also</s> therefore my counsel to you cheat is to make haste to die or to findcourage to fall upon a spear unless you would learn how it feels to bebrayed with sticks like a green hide until none can know that youwere once a man</s>  send now and tell my words to masapo the boar</s>  and tomameena say that soon i will come to take her with spears and not withcattle</s>  do you understand</s>  oh</s>  i see that you do since already you weepwith fear like a woman</s>  then farewell to you till that day when ireturn with the sticks o umbezi the cheat and the liar umbezieaterupofelephants and turning saduko stalked away</s> i was about to follow in a great hurry having had enough of this veryunpleasant scene when poor old umbezi sprang at me and clasped me bythe arm</s> o macumazana he exclaimed weeping in his terror o macumazanaif

macumazahnif she had been your daughter and a powerful chief had appeared with ahundred and twenty head of such beautiful cattle you would have givenher to him would you not although he is of mixed

this as in other matters you white men are madand macumazahn to tell you the truth i believe it is you she reallycares for she said as much to me once or twice</s>  well why did you nottake her away when i was not looking</s>  we could have settled mattersafterwards and i should have been free of her witcheries and not up tomy neck in this hole as i am now</s> because some people dont do that kind of thing umbezi</s> no no i forgot</s>  oh</s>  why can i not remember that you are quite madand therefore that it must not be expected of you to act as though youwere sane</s>  well at least you are that tiger sadukos friend whichagain shows that you must be very mad for most people would sooner tryto milk a cow buffalo than walk hand in hand with him</s>  dont you seemacumazahn that he means to kill me macumazahn to bray me like agreen hide</s>  ugh</s>  to beat me to death with sticks</s>  ugh</s>  and what is morethat unless you prevent him he will certainly do it perhaps tomorrowor the next day</s>  ugh</s>  ugh</s>  ugh</s> yes i see umbezi and i think that he will do it</s>  but what i do notsee is how i am to prevent him</s>  remember that you let mameena grow intohis heart and behaved badly to him umbezi</s> i never promised her to him macumazahn</s>  i only said that if he broughta hundred cattle then i might promise</s> well he has wiped out the amakoba the enemies of his house and thereare the hundred cattle whereof he has many more and now it is too latefor you to keep your share of the bargain</s>  so i think you must makeyourself as comfortable as you can in the hole that your hands dugumbezi which i would not share for all the cattle in zululand</s> truly you are not one from whom to seek comfort in the hour ofdistress groaned poor umbezi then added brightening up but perhapspanda will kill him because he has wiped out bangu in a time of peace</s> oh macumazahn can you not persuade panda to kill him</s>  if so i now havemore cattle than i really wantimpossible i answered</s>  panda is his friend and between ourselves imay tell you that he ate up the amakoba by his especial wish</s>  when theking hears of it he will call to saduko to sit in his shadow and makehim great one of his councillors probably with power of life and deathover little people like you and masapo</s> then it is finished said umbezi faintly and i will try to dielike a man</s>  but to be brayed like a hide</s>  and with thin sticks</s>  oh</s>  headded grinding his teeth if only i can get hold of mameena i willnot leave much of that pretty hair of hers upon her head</s>  i will tie herhands and shut her up with the old cow who loves her as a meercatloves a mouse</s>  no i will kill her</s>  theredo you hear macumazahnunless you do something to help me i will kill mameena and you wontlike that for i am sure she is dear to you although you were not manenough to run away with her as she wished</s> if you touch mameena i said be certain my friend that sadukossticks and your skin will not be far apart for i will report you topanda myself as an unnatural evildoer</s>  now hearken to me you old fool</s> saduko is so fond of your daughter on this point being mad as you sayi am that if only he could get her i think he might overlook the factof her having been married before</s>  what you have to do is to try tobuy her back from masapo</s>  mind you i say buy her backnot get herby bloodshedwhich you might do by persuading masapo to put her away</s> then if he knew that you were trying to do this i think that sadukomight leave his sticks uncut for a while</s> i will try</s>  i will indeed macumazahn</s>  i will try very hard</s>  it is truemasapo is an obstinate pig still if he knows that his own life isat stake he might give way</s>  moreover when she learns that sadukohas grown rich and great mameena might help me</s>  oh i thank youmacumazahn you are indeed the prop of my hut and it and all in it areyours</s>  farewell farewell macumazahn if you must go</s>  but whywhy didyou not run away with mameena and save me all this fear and trouble</s> so i and that old humbug umbezi eaterupofelephants parted fora while and never did i know him in a more chastened frame of mindexcept once as i shall tell</s> chapter viii</s>  the kings daughterwhen i got back to my wagons after this semitragical interview withthat bombastic and selfseeking old windbag umbezi it was to findthat saduko and his warriors had already marched for the kings kraalnodwengu</s>  a message awaited me however to the effect that it washoped that i would follow in order to make report of the affair of thedestruction of the amakoba</s>  this after reflection i determined todo really i think because of the intense human interest of the wholebusiness</s>  i wanted to see how it would work out</s> also in a way i read sadukos mind and understood that at the momenthe did not wish to discuss the matter of his hideous disappointment</s> whatever else may have been false in this mans nature one thingrang true namely his love or his infatuation for the girl mameena</s> throughout his life she was his guiding starabout as evil a star ascould have arisen upon any mans horizon the fatal star that was tolight him down to doom</s>  let me thank providence as i do that i wasso fortunate as to escape its baneful influences although i admit thatthey attracted me not a little</s> so seduced thither by my curiosity which has so often led me intotrouble i trekked to nodwengu full of many doubts not unmingled withamusement for i could not rid my mind of recollections of the utterterror of the eaterupofelephants when he was brought face to facewith the dreadful and concentrated rage of the robbed saduko and thepromise of his vengeance</s>  ultimately i arrived at the great placewithout experiencing any adventure that is worthy of record and campedin a spot that was appointed to me by some induna whose name i forgetbut who evidently knew of my approach for i found him awaiting me atsome distance from the town</s>  here i sat for quite a long while two orthree days if i remember right amusing myself with killing or missingturtledoves with a shotgun and similar pastimes until somethingshould happen or i grew tired and started for natal</s> in the end just as i was about to trek seawards an old friend maputaturned up at my wagonsthat same man who had brought me the messagefrom panda before we started to attack bangu</s> greeting macumazahn he said</s>  what of the amakoba</s>  i see they didnot kill you</s> no i answered handing him some snuff they did not quite kill mefor here i am</s>  what is your pleasure with me</s> o macumazana only that the king wishes to know whether you have any ofthose little balls left in the box which i brought back to you sinceif so he thinks he would like to swallow one of them in this hotweather</s> i proffered him the whole box but he would not take it saying that theking would like me to give it to him myself</s>  now i understood that thiswas a summons to an audience and asked when it would please pandato receive me and thelittleblackstonesthatworkwonders</s>  heansweredat once</s> so we started and within an hour i stood or rather sat before panda</s> like all his family the king was an enormous man but unlike chaka andthose of his brothers whom i had known one of a kindly countenance</s> i saluted him by lifting my cap and took my place upon a wooden stoolthat had been provided for me outside the great hut in the shadow ofwhich he sat within his isigohlo or private enclosure</s> greeting o macumazana he said</s>  i am glad to see you safe and wellfor i understand that you have been engaged upon a perilous adventuresince last we met</s> yes king i answered but to which adventure do you referthatof the buffalo when saduko helped me or that of the amakoba when ihelped saduko</s> the latter macumazahn of which i desire to hear all the story</s> so i told it to him he and i being alone for he commanded hiscouncillors and servants to retire out of hearing</s> wow</s>  he said when i had finished you are clever as a baboonmacumazahn</s>  that was a fine trick to set a trap for bangu and hisamakoba dogs and bait it with his own cattle</s>  but they tell me that yourefused your share of those cattle</s>  now why was that macumazahn</s> by way of answer i repeated to panda my reasons which i have set outalready</s> ah</s>  he exclaimed when i had finished</s>  every one seeks greatness inhis own way and perhaps yours is better than ours</s>  well the white manwalks one roador some of them doand the black man another</s>  they bothend at the same place and none will know which is the right road tillthe journey is done</s>  meanwhile what you lose saduko and his peoplegain</s>  he is a wise man saduko who knows how to choose his friends andhis wisdom has brought him victory and gifts</s>  but to you macumazahn ithas brought nothing but honour on which if a man feeds only he willgrow thin</s> i like to be thin o panda i answered slowly</s> yes yes i understand replied the king who in common with mostnatives was quick enough to seize a point and i too like people whokeep thin on such food as yours people also whose hands are alwaysclean</s>  we zulus trust you macumazahn as we trust few white men for wehave known for years that your lips say what your heart thinks andthat your heart always thinks the thing which is good</s>  you may be namedwatcherbynight but you love light not darkness</s> now at these somewhat unusual compliments i bowed and felt myselfcolouring a little as i did so even through my sunburn but i made noanswer to them since to do so would have involved a discussion of thepast and its tragical events into which i had no wish to enter</s>  pandatoo remained silent for a while</s>  then he called to a messenger tosummon the princes cetewayo and umbelazi and to bid saduko the son ofmatiwane to wait without in case he should wish to speak with him</s> a few minutes later the two princes arrived</s>  i watched their coming withinterest for they were the most important men in zululand and alreadythe nation debated fiercely which of them would succeed to the throne</s>  iwill try to describe them a little</s> they were both of much the same ageit is always difficult to arriveat a zulus exact yearsand both fine young men</s>  cetewayo however hadthe stronger countenance</s>  it was said that he resembled that fierce andable monster chaka the wild beast his uncle and certainly i perceivedin him a likeness to his other uncle dingaan umpandas predecessorwhom i had known but too well when i was a lad</s>  he had the same surlyeyes and haughty bearing also when he was angry his mouth shut itselfin the same iron fashion</s> of umbelazi it is difficult for me to speak without enthusiasm</s>  asmameena was the most beautiful woman i ever saw in zululandalthoughit is true that old wardog umslopogaas a friend of mine who does notcome into this story used to tell me that nada the lily whom i havementioned was even lovelierso umbelazi was by far the most splendidman</s>  indeed the zulus named him umbelazi the handsome and no wonder</s> to begin with he stood at least three inches above the tallest of themfrom a quarter of a mile away i have recognised him by his greatheight even through the dust of a desperate battle and his breadthwas proportionate to his stature</s>  then he was perfectly made his greatshapely limbs ending like sadukos in small hands and feet</s>  his facetoo was wellcut and open his colour lighter than cetewayos and hiseyes which always seemed to smile were large and dark</s> even before they passed the small gate of the inner fence it was easyfor me to see that this royal pair were not upon the best of termsfor each of them tried to get through it first to show his right ofprecedence</s>  the result was somewhat ludicrous for they jammed in thegateway</s>  here however umbelazis greater weight told for putting outhis strength he squeezed his brother into the reeds of the fence andwon through a foot or so in front of him</s> you grow too fat my brother i heard cetewayo say and saw him scowlas he spoke</s>  if i had held an assegai in my hand you would have beencut</s> i know it my brother answered umbelazi with a goodhumoured laughbut i knew also that none may appear before the king armed</s>  had it beenotherwise i would rather have followed after you</s> now at this hint of umbelazis that he would not trust his brotherbehind his back with a spear although it seemed to be conveyed in jesti saw panda shift uneasily on his seat while cetewayo scowled even moreominously than before</s>  however no further words passed between themand walking up to the king side by side they saluted him with raisedhands calling out baba</s> that is father</s> greeting my children said panda adding hastily for he foresaw aquarrel as to which of them should take the seat of honour on his rightsit there in front of me both of you and macumazahn do you comehither and he pointed to the coveted place</s>  i am a little deaf in myleft ear this morning</s> so these brothers sat themselves down in front of the king nor werethey i think grieved to find this way out of their rivalry but firstthey shook hands with me for i knew them both though not well andeven in this small matter the old trouble arose since there wassome difficulty as to which of them should first offer me his hand</s> ultimately i remember cetewayo won this trick</s> when these preliminaries were finished panda addressed the princessayingmy sons i have sent for you to ask your counsel upon a certainmatternot a large matter but one that may grow</s>  and he paused totake snuff whereon both of them ejaculatedwe hear you father</s> well my sons the matter is that of saduko the son of matiwane chiefof the amangwane whom bangu chief of the amakoba ate up years ago byleave of him who went before me</s>  now this bangu as you know has forsome time been a thorn in my foota thorn that caused it to festerandyet i did not wish to make war on him</s>  so i spoke a word in the ear ofsaduko saying he is yours if you can kill him and his cattle areyours</s>  well saduko is not dull</s>  with the help of this white manmacumazahn our friend from of old he has killed bangu and taken hiscattle and already my foot is beginning to heal</s> we have heard it said cetewayo</s> it was a great deed added umbelazi a more generous critic</s> yes continued panda i too think it was a great deed seeing thatsaduko had but a small regiment of wanderers to back himnay interrupted cetewayo it was not those eaters of rats who wonhim the day it was the wisdom of this macumazahn</s> macumazahns wisdom would have been of little use without the courageof saduko and his rats commented umbelazi and from this moment i sawthat the two brothers were taking sides for and against saduko as theydid upon every other matter not because they cared for the right ofwhatever was in question but because they wished to oppose each other</s> quite so went on the king i agree with both of you my sons</s>  butthe point is this i think saduko a man of promise and one who shouldbe advanced that he may learn to love us all especially as his househas suffered wrong from our house since hewhoisgone listened tothe evil counsel of bangu and allowed him to kill out matiwanes tribewithout just cause</s>  therefore in order to wipe away this stain andbind saduko to us i think it well to reestablish saduko in thechieftainship of the amangwane with the lands that his father held andto give him also the chieftainship of the amakoba of whom it seemsthat the women and children with some of the men remain although healready holds their cattle which he has captured in war</s> as the king pleases said umbelazi with a yawn for he was growingweary of listening to the case of saduko</s> but cetewayo said nothing for he appeared to be thinking of somethingelse</s> i think also went on panda in a rather uncertain voice in order tobind him so close that the bonds may never be broken it would be wiseto give him a woman of our family in marriage</s> why should this little amangwane be allowed to marry into the royalhouse</s>  asked cetewayo looking up</s>  if he is dangerous why not killhim and have done</s> for this reason my son</s>  there is trouble ahead in zululand and i donot wish to kill those who may help us in that hour nor do i wishthem to become our enemies</s>  i wish that they may be our friends andtherefore it seems to me wise when we find a seed of greatness towater it and not to dig it up or plant it in a neighbours garden</s>  fromhis deeds i believe that this saduko is such a seed</s> our father has spoken said umbelazi and i like saduko who is a manof mettle and good blood</s>  which of our sisters does our father proposeto give to him</s> she who is named after the mother of our race o umbelazi she whomyour own mother boreyour sister nandie in english the sweet</s> a great gift o my father since nandie is both fair and wise</s>  alsowhat does she think of this matter</s> she thinks well of it umbelazi for she has seen saduko and taken aliking to him</s>  she told me herself that she wishes no other husband</s> is it so</s>  replied umbelazi indifferently</s>  then if the king commandsand the kings daughter desires what more is there to be said</s> much i think broke in cetewayo</s>  i hold that it is out of place thatthis little man who has but conquered a little tribe by borrowingthe wit of macumazahn here should be rewarded not only with achieftainship but with the hand of the wisest and most beautiful of thekings daughters even though umbelazi he added with a sneer shouldbe willing to throw him his own sister like a bone to a passing dog</s> who threw the bone cetewayo</s>  asked umbelazi awaking out of hisindifference</s>  was it the king or was it i who never heard of thematter till this moment</s>  and who are we that we should question thekings decrees</s>  is it our business to judge or to obey</s> has saduko perchance made you a present of some of those cattle whichhe stole from the amakoba umbelazi</s>  asked cetewayo</s>  as our fatherasks no lobola perhaps you have taken the gift instead</s> the only gift that i have taken from saduko said umbelazi who icould see was hard pressed to keep his temper is that of his service</s> he is my friend which is why you hate him as you hate all my friends</s> must i then love every stray cur that licks your hand umbelazi</s>  oh noneed to tell me he is your friend for i know it was you who put itinto our fathers heart to allow him to kill bangu and steal his cattlewhich i hold to be an ill deed for now the great house is thatchedwith his reeds and bangus blood is on its doorposts</s>  moreover he whowrought the wrong is to come and dwell therein and for aught i knowto be called a prince like you and me</s>  why should he not since theprincess nandie is to be given to him in marriage</s>  certainly umbelaziyou would do well to take the cattle which this white trader hasrefused for all men know that you have earned them</s> now umbelazi sprang up straightening himself to the full of his greatheight and spoke in a voice that was thick with passion</s> i pray your leave to withdraw o king he said since if i stay herelonger i shall grow sorry that i have no spear in my hand</s>  yet before igo i will tell the truth</s>  cetewayo hates saduko because knowing himto be a chief of wit and courage who will grow great he sought him forhis man saying sit you in my shadow after he had promised to sit inmine</s>  therefore it is that he heaps these taunts upon me</s>  let him denyit if he can</s> that i shall not trouble to do umbelazi answered cetewayo with ascowl</s>  who are you that spy upon my doings and with a mouth full oflies call me to account before the king</s>  i will hear no more of it</s>  doyou bide here and pay saduko his price with the person of our sister</s> for as the king has promised her his word cannot be changed</s>  only letyour dog know that i keep a stick for him if he should snarl at me</s> farewell my father</s>  i go upon a journey to my own lordship the landof gikazi and there you will find me when you want me which i praymay not be till after this marriage is finished for on that i will nottrust my eyes to look</s> then with a salute he turned and departed bidding no goodbye to hisbrother</s> my hand however he shook in farewell for cetewayo was always friendlyto me perhaps because he thought i might be useful to him</s>  also as ilearned afterwards he was very pleased with me for the reason that ihad refused my share of the amakoba cattle and that he knew i had nopart in this proposed marriage between saduko and nandie of whichindeed i now heard for the first time</s> my father said umbelazi when cetewayo had gone is this to beborne</s>  am i to blame in the matter</s>  you have heard and seenanswer memy father</s> no you are not to blame this time umbelazi replied the king with aheavy sigh</s>  but oh</s>  my sons my sons where will your quarrelling end</s> i think that only a river of blood can quench so fierce a fire and thenwhich of you will live to reach its bank</s> for a while he looked at umbelazi and i saw love and fear in his eyefor towards him panda always had more affection than for any of hisother children</s> cetewayo has behaved ill he said at length and before a white manwho will report the matter which makes it worse</s>  he has no rightto dictate to me to whom i shall or shall not give my daughters inmarriage</s>  moreover i have spoken nor do i change my word because hethreatens me</s>  it is known throughout the land that i never change myword and the white men know it also do they not o macumazana</s> i answered yes they did</s>  also this was true for like most weak menpanda was very obstinate and honest too in his own fashion</s> he waved his hand to show that the subject was ended then badeumbelazi go to the gate and send a messenger to bring in the son ofmatiwane</s> presently saduko arrived looking very stately and composed as he liftedhis right hand and gave panda the baytethe royal salute</s> be seated said the king</s>  i have words for your ear</s> thereon with the most perfect grace without hurrying and without unduedelay saduko crouched himself down upon his knees with one of hiselbows resting on the ground as only a native knows how to do withoutlooking absurd and waited</s> son of matiwane said the king i have heard all the story of howwith a small company you destroyed bangu and most of the men of theamakoba and ate up their cattle every one</s> your pardon black one interrupted saduko</s>  i am but a boy i didnothing</s>  it was macumazahn watcherbynight who sits yonder</s>  hiswisdom taught me how to snare the amakoba after they were decoyed fromtheir mountain and it was tshoza my uncle who loosed the cattle fromthe kraals</s>  i say that i did nothing except to strike a blow or twowith a spear when i must just as a baboon throws stones at those whowould steal its young</s> i am glad to see that you are no boaster saduko said panda</s>  wouldthat more of the zulus were like you in that matter for then i must notlisten to so many loud songs about little things</s>  at least bangu waskilled and his proud tribe humbled and for reasons of state i am gladthat this happened without my moving a regiment or being mixed up withthe business for i tell you that there are some of my family who lovedbangu</s>  but ii loved your father matiwane whom bangu butchered forwe were brought up together as boysyes and served together in thesame regiment the amawombe when the wild one my brother ruledhe meant chaka for among the zulus the names of dead kings arehlonipathat is they must not be spoken if it can be avoided</s> therefore went on panda for this reason and for others i am gladthat bangu has been punished and that although vengeance has crawledafter him like a footsore bull at length he has been tossed with itshorns and crushed with its knees</s> yebo ngonyama</s>  yes o lion</s>  said saduko</s> now saduko went on panda because you are your fathers son andbecause you have shown yourself a man although you are still littlein the land i am minded to advance you</s>  therefore i give to you thechieftainship over those who remain of the amakoba and over all of theamangwane blood whom you can gather</s> bayte</s>  as the king pleases said saduko</s> and i give you leave to become a kehlaa wearer of theheadringalthough as you have said you are still but a boy and withit a place upon my council</s> bayte</s>  as the king pleases said saduko still apparently unmoved bythe honours that were being heaped upon him</s> and son of matiwane went on panda you are still unmarried are younot</s> now for the first time sadukos face changed</s>  yes black one hesaid hurriedly buthere he caught my eye and reading some warning in it was silent</s> but repeated panda after him doubtless you would like to be</s>  wellit is natural in a young man who wishes to found a house and thereforei give you leave to marry</s> yebo silo</s>  yes o wild beast</s>  i thank the king buthere i sneezed loudly and he ceased</s> but repeated panda of course you do not know where to find a wifebetween the time the hawk stoops and the rat squeaks in its claws</s>  howshould you who have never thought of the matter</s>  also he continuedwith a smile it is well that you have not thought of it since shewhom i shall give to you could not live in the second hut in your kraaland call another inkosikazi that is head lady or chieftainess</s> umbelazi my son go fetch her of whom we have thought as a bride forthis boy</s> now umbelazi rose and went with a broad smile upon his face whilepanda somewhat fatigued with all his speechmakingfor he was veryfat and the day was very hotleaned his head back against the hut andclosed his eyes</s> o black one</s>  o thou who consumeth with rage</s>  dhlangamandhla brokeout saduko who i could see was much disturbed</s>  i have something tosay to you</s> no doubt no doubt answered panda drowsily but save up your thankstill you have seen or you will have none left afterwards and hesnored slightly</s> now i perceiving that saduko was about to ruin himself thought it wellto interfere though what business of mine it was to do so i cannot say</s> at any rate if only i had held my tongue at this moment and allowedsaduko to make a fool of himself as he wished to dofor where mameenawas concerned he never could be wisei verily believe that all thehistory of zululand would have run a different course and that manythousands of men white and black who are now dead would be alivetoday</s>  but fate ordered it otherwise</s>  yes it was not i who spoke butfate</s>  the angel of doom used my throat as his trumpet</s> seeing that panda dozed i slipped behind saduko and gripped him by thearm</s> are you mad</s>  i whispered into his ear</s>  will you throw away yourfortune and your life also</s> but mameena he whispered back</s>  i would marry none save mameena</s> fool</s>  i answered</s>  mameena has betrayed and spat upon you</s>  take whatthe heavens send you and give thanks</s>  would you wear masapos soiledblanket</s> macumazahn he said in a hollow voice i will follow your head andnot my own heart</s>  yet you sow a strange seed macumazahn or so you maythink when you see its fruit</s>  and he gave me a wild looka look thatfrightened me</s> there was something in this look which caused me to reflect that i mightdo well to go away and leave saduko mameena nandie and the rest ofthem to dree their weirds as the scotch say for after all what wasmy finger doing in that very hot stew</s>  getting burnt i thought and notcollecting any stew</s> yet looking back on these events how could i foresee what would be theend of the madness of saduko of the fearful machinations of mameenaand of the weakness of umbelazi when she snared him in the net of herbeauty thus bringing about his ruin through the hate of saduko and theambition of cetewayo</s>  how could i know that at the back of all theseevents stood the old dwarf zikali the wise working night and dayto slake the enmity and fulfil the vengeance which long ago he hadconceived and planned against the royal house of senzangakona and thezulu people over whom it ruled</s> yes he stood there like a man behind a great stone upon the brow ofa mountain slowly remorselessly with infinite skill labour andpatience pushing that stone to the edge of the cliff whence at lengthin the appointed hour it would thunder down upon those who dweltbeneath to leave them crushed and no more a people</s>  how could i guessthat we the actors in this play were all the while helping him to pushthat stone and that he cared nothing how many of us were carried withit into the abyss if only we brought about the triumph of his secretunutterable rage and hate</s> now i see and understand all these things as it is easy to do but theni was blind nor did the voices reach my dull ears to warn me as howor why i cannot tell they did i believe reach those of zikali</s> oh what was the sum of it</s>  just this i think and nothing morethatas saduko and the others were mameenas tools and as all of them andtheir passions were zikalis tools so he himself was the tool of someunseen power that used him and us to accomplish its design</s>  which isuppose is fatalism or in other words all these things happenedbecause they must happen</s>  a poor conclusion to reach after so muchthought and striving and not complimentary to man and his boastedpowers of free will still one to which many of us are often drivenespecially if we have lived among savages where such dramas workthemselves out openly and swiftly unhidden from our eyes by the veilsand subterfuges of civilisation</s>  at least there is this comfortabout itthat if we are but feathers blown by the wind how can theindividual feather be blamed because it did not travel against turn orkeep back the wind</s> well let me return from these speculations to the history of the factsthat caused them</s> just asa little too latei had made up my mind that i would go aftermy own business and leave saduko to manage his through the fencegateway appeared the great tall umbelazi leading by the hand a woman</s> as i saw in a moment it did not need certain bangles of copperornaments of ivory and of very rare pink beads called infibinga whichonly those of the royal house were permitted to wear to proclaim hera person of rank for dignity and high blood were apparent in her faceher carriage her gestures and all that had to do with her</s> nandie the sweet was not a great beauty as was mameena althoughher figure was fine and her stature like that of all the race ofsenzangakonaconsiderably above the average</s>  to begin with she wasdarker in hue and her lips were rather thick as was her nose nor wereher eyes large and liquid like those of an antelope</s>  further she lackedthe informing mystery of mameenas face that at times was broken andlit up by flashes of alluring light and quick sympathetic perceptionas a heavy evening sky that seems to join the dim earth to the dimmerheavens is illuminated by pulsings of fire soft and manyhuedsuggesting but not revealing the strength and splendour that it veils</s> nandie had none of these attractions which after all anywhere uponthe earth belong only to a few women in each generation</s>  she was asimple honestnatured kindly affectionate young woman of high birthno more that is as these qualities are understood and expressed amongher people</s> umbelazi led her forward into the presence of the king to whom shebowed gracefully enough</s>  then after casting a swift sidelong glance atsaduko which i found it difficult to interpret and another of inquiryat me she folded her hands upon her breast and stood silent with benthead waiting to be addressed</s> the address was brief enough for panda was still sleepy</s> my daughter he said with a yawn there stands your husband andhe jerked his thumb towards saduko</s>  he is a young man and a brave andunmarried also one who should grow great in the shadow of our houseespecially as he is a friend of your brother umbelazi</s>  i understandalso that you have seen him and like him</s>  unless you have anything tosay against it for as not being a common father the king receives nocattleat least in this casei am not prejudiced but will listen toyour words and he chuckled in a drowsy fashion</s>  i propose thatthe marriage should take place tomorrow</s>  now my daughter have youanything to say</s>  for if so please say it at once as i am tired</s>  theeternal wranglings between your brethren cetewayo and umbelazi haveworn me out</s> now nandie looked about her in her open honest fashion her gazeresting first on saduko then on umbelazi and lastly upon me</s> my father she said at length in her soft steady voice tell me ibeseech you who proposes this marriage</s>  is it the chief saduko is itthe prince umbelazi or is it the white lord whose true name i do notknow but who is called macumazahn watcherbynight</s> i cant remember which of them proposed it yawned panda</s>  who cankeep on talking about things from night till morning</s>  at any rate ipropose it and i will make your husband a big man among our people</s> have you anything to say against it</s> i have nothing to say my father</s>  i have met saduko and like himwellfor the rest you are the judge</s>  but she added slowly doessaduko like me</s>  when he speaks my name does he feel it here</s>  and shepointed to her throat</s> i am sure i do not know what he feels in his throat panda repliedtestily but i feel that mine is dry</s>  well as no one says anythingthe matter is settled</s>  tomorrow saduko shall give the umqoliso theox of the girl that makes marriageif he has not got one here i willlend it to him and you can take the new big hut that i have built inthe outer kraal to dwell in for the present</s>  there will be a dance ifyou wish it if not i do not care for i have no wish for ceremony justnow who am too troubled with great matters</s>  now i am going to sleep</s> then sinking from his stool on to his knees panda crawled through thedoorway of his great hut which was close to him and vanished</s> umbelazi and i departed also through the gateway of the fence leavingsaduko and the princess nandie alone together for there were noattendants present</s>  what happened between them i am sure i do notknow but i gather that in one way or another saduko made himselfsufficiently agreeable to the princess to persuade her to take him tohusband</s>  perhaps being already enamoured of him she was not difficultto persuade</s>  at any rate on the morrow without any great feasting orfuss except the customary dance the umqoliso the ox of the girlwas slaughtered and saduko became the husband of a royal maiden of thehouse of senzangakona</s> certainly as i remember reflecting it was a remarkable rise in lifefor one who but a few months before had been without possessions or ahome</s> i may add that after our brief talk in the kings kraal while pandawas dozing i had no further words with saduko on this matter of hismarriage for between its proposal and the event he avoided me nor didi seek him out</s>  on the day of the marriage also i trekked for nataland for a whole year heard no more of saduko nandie and mameenaalthough to be frank i must admit i thought of the last of thesepersons more often perhaps than i should have done</s> the truth is that mameena was one of those women who sticks in a mansmind even more closely than a waitabit thorn does in his coat</s> chapter ix</s>  allan returns to zululanda whole year had gone by in which i did or tried to do various thingsthat have no connection with this story when once more i foundmyself in zululandat umbezis kraal indeed</s>  hither i had trekked infulfilment of a certain bargain already alluded to that was concernedwith ivory and guns which i had made with the old fellow or ratherwith masapo his soninlaw whom he represented in this matter</s>  intothe exact circumstances of that bargain i do not enter since at themoment i cannot recall whether i ever obtained the necessary permitto import those guns into zululand although now that i am older iearnestly hope that i did so since it is wrong to sell weapons tonatives that may be put to all sorts of unforeseen uses</s> at any rate there i was sitting alone with the headman in his hutdiscussing a dram of squareface that i had given to him for thetrade was finished to our mutual satisfaction and scowl my bodyservant with the hunters had just carried off the ivorya fine lot oftusksto my wagons</s> well umbezi i said and how has it fared with you since we parted ayear ago</s>  have you seen anything of saduko who you may remember leftyou in some wrath</s> thanks be to my spirit i have seen nothing of that wild manmacumazahn answered umbezi shaking his fat old head in a fashionwhich showed great anxiety</s>  yet i have heard of him for he sent me amessage the other day to tell me that he had not forgotten what he owedme</s> did he mean the sticks with which he promised to bray you like a greenhide</s>  i inquired innocently</s> i think so macumazahni think so for certainly he owes me nothingelse</s>  and the worst of it is that there at pandas kraal he has grownlike a pumpkin on a dung heapgreat great</s> and therefore is now one who can pay any debt that he owes umbezi isaid taking a pull at the squareface and looking at him over the topof the pannikin</s> doubtless he can macumazahn and between you and me that is the realreason why ior rather masapowas so anxious to get those guns</s>  theywere not for hunting as he told you by the messenger or for war butto protect us against saduko in case he should attack</s>  well now i hopewe shall be able to hold our own</s> you and masapo must teach your people to use them first umbezi</s>  buti expect saduko has forgotten all about both of you now that he is thehusband of a princess of the royal blood</s>  tell me how goes it withmameena</s> oh well well macumazahn</s>  for is she not the head lady of theamasomi</s>  there is nothing wrong with hernothing at all except that asyet she has no child also that and he paused</s> that what</s>  i asked</s> that she hates the very sight of her husband masapo and says thatshe would rather be married to a baboonyes to a baboonthan to himwhich gives him offence after he has paid so many cattle for her</s> but what of this macumazahn</s>  there is always a grain missing uponthe finest head of corn</s>  nothing is quite perfect in the worldmacumazahn and if mameena does not chance to love her husband and heshrugged his shoulders and drank some squareface</s> of course it does not matter in the least umbezi except to mameenaand her husband who no doubt will settle down in time now that sadukois married to a princess of the zulu house</s> i hope so macumazahn but to tell the truth i wish you had broughtmore guns for i live amongst a terrible lot of people</s>  masapo who isfurious with mameena because she will have none of him and thereforewith me as though i could control mameena mameena who is mad withmasapo and therefore with me because i gave her in marriage to himsaduko who foams at the mouth at the name of masapo because he hasmarried mameena whom it is said he still loves and therefore at mebecause i am her father and did my best to settle her in the world</s>  ohgive me some more of that firewater macumazahn for it makes me forgetall these things and especially that my guardian spirit made me thefather of mameena with whom you would not run away when you might havedone so</s>  oh macumazahn why did you not run away with mameena and turnher into a quiet white woman who ties herself up in sacks sings songsto the greatgreat in the skythat is hymns to the power aboveusand never thinks of any man who is not her husband</s> because if i had done so umbezi i should have ceased to be a quietwhite man</s>
 and now umbeziyou have had quite enough squareface so i will take the bottle awaywith me</s>  goodnight</s> on the following morning i trekked very early from umbeziskraalbefore he was up indeed for the squareface made him sleepsound</s>  my destination was nodwengu pandas great place where i hopedto do some trading but as i was in no particular hurry my plan wasto go round by masapos and see for myself how it fared between him andmameena</s>  indeed i reached the borders of the amasomi territory whereofmasapo was chief by evening and camped there</s>  but with the night camereflection and reflection told me that i should do well to keep clearof mameena and her domestic complications if she had any</s>  so i changedmy mind and next morning trekked on to nodwengu by the only routethat my guides reported to be practicable one which took me a long wayround</s> that day owing to the roughness of the roadif road it could becalledand an accident to one of the wagons we only covered aboutfifteen miles and as night fell were obliged to outspan at the firstspot where we could find water</s>  when the oxen had been unyoked ilooked about me and saw that we were in a place that although i hadapproached it from a somewhat different direction i recognised at onceas the mouth of the black kloof in which over a year before i hadinterviewed zikali the little and wise</s>  there was no mistaking thespot that blasted valley with the piledup columns of boulders and theoverhanging cliff at the end of it have so far as i am aware no exactcounterparts in africa</s> i sat upon the box of the first wagon eating my food which consistedof some biltong and biscuit for i had not bothered to shoot any gamethat day which was very hot and wondering whether zikali were stillalive also whether i should take the trouble to walk up the kloof andfind out</s>  on the whole i thought that i would not as the place repelledme and i did not particularly wish to hear any more of his propheciesand fierce illomened talk</s>  so i just sat there studying the wonderfuleffect of the red evening light pouring up between those walls offantastic rocks</s> presently i perceived far away a single human figurewhether it wereman or woman i could not tellwalking towards me along the path whichran at the bottom of the cleft</s>  in those gigantic surroundings itlooked extraordinarily small and lonely although perhaps because of theintense red light in which it was bathed or perhaps just because itwas human a living thing in the midst of all that still inanimategrandeur it caught and focused my attention</s>  i grew greatly interestedin it i wondered if it were that of man or woman and what it was doinghere in this haunted valley</s> the figure drew nearer and now i saw it was slender and tall like thatof a lad or of a wellgrown woman but to which sex it belonged i couldnot see because it was draped in a cloak of beautiful grey fur</s>  justthen scowl came to the other side of the wagon to speak to me aboutsomething which took off my attention for the next two minutes</s>  when ilooked round again it was to see the figure standing within three yardsof me its face hidden by a kind of hood which was attached to the furcloak</s> who are you and what is your business</s>  i asked whereon a gentlevoice answereddo you not know me o macumazana</s> how can i know one who is tied up like a gourd in a mat</s>  yet is itnotis it notyes it is mameena and i am very pleased that you should remember myvoice macumazahn after we have been separated for such a long longtime and with a sudden movement she threw back the kaross hood andall revealing herself in all her strange beauty</s> i jumped down off the wagonbox and took her hand</s> o macumazana she said while i still held itor to be accuratewhile she still held mineindeed my heart is glad to see a friendagain and she looked at me with her appealing eyes which in the redlight i could see appeared to float in tears</s> a friend mameena</s>  i exclaimed</s>  why now you are so rich and thewife of a big chief you must have plenty of friends</s> alas</s>  macumazahn i am rich in nothing except trouble for my husbandsaves like the ants for winter</s>  why he even grudged me this poorkaross and as for friends he is so jealous that he will not allow meany</s> he cannot be jealous of women mameena</s> oh women</s>  piff</s>  i do not care for women they are very unkind to mebecausebecausewell perhaps you can guess why macumazahnshe answered glancing at her own reflection in a little travellinglookingglass that hung from the woodwork of the wagon for i had beenusing it to brush my hair and smiled very sweetly</s> at least you have your husband mameena and i thought that perhaps bythis timeshe held up her hand</s> my husband</s>  oh i would that i had him not for i hate him macumazahnand as for the restnever</s>  the truth is that i never cared for any manexcept one whose name you may chance to remember macumazahn</s> i suppose you mean saduko i began</s> tell me macumazahn she inquired innocently are white people verystupid</s>  i ask because you do not seem as clever as you used to be</s>  orhave you perhaps a bad memory</s> now i felt myself turning red as the sky behind me and broke inhurriedlyif you did not like your husband mameena you should not have marriedhim</s>  you know you need not unless you wished</s> when one has only two thorn bushes to sit on macumazahn one choosesthat which seems to have the fewest prickles to discover sometimes thatthey are still there in hundreds although one did not see them</s>  youknow that at length everyone gets tired of standing</s> is that why you have taken to walking mameena</s>  i mean what are youdoing here alone</s> i</s>  oh i heard that you were passing this way and came to have a talkwith you</s>  no from you i cannot hide even the least bit of the truth</s>  icame to talk with you but also i came to see zikali and ask him what awife should do who hates her husband</s> indeed</s>  and what did he answer you</s> he answered that he thought she had better run away with another manif there were one whom she did not hateout of zululand of courseshe replied looking first at me and then at my wagon and the two horsesthat were tied to it</s> is that all he said mameena</s> no</s>  have i not told you that i cannot hide one grain of the truth fromyou</s>  he added that the only other thing to be done was to sit still anddrink my sour milk pretending that it is sweet until my spirit givesme a new cow</s>  he seemed to think that my spirit would be bountiful inthe matter of new cowsone day</s> anything more</s>  i inquired</s> one little thing</s>  have i not told you that you shall have allall thetruth</s>  zikali seemed to think also that at last every one of my herd ofcows old and new would come to a bad end</s>  he did not tell me to whatend</s> she turned her head aside and when she looked up again i saw that shewas weeping really weeping this time not just making her eyes swim asshe did before</s> of course they will come to a bad end macumazahn she went on in asoft thick voice for i and all with whom i have to do were torn outof the reeds i</s> e</s>  created that way</s>  and thats why i wont tempt youto run away with me any more as i meant to do when i saw you becauseit is true macumazahn you are the only man i ever liked or evershall like and you know i could make you run away with me if i chosealthough i am black and you are whiteoh yes before tomorrowmorning</s>  but i wont do it for why should i catch you in my unlucky weband bring you into all sorts of trouble among my people and your own</s>  goyou your road macumazahn and i will go mine as the wind blows me</s>  andnow give me a cup of water and let me be awaya cup of water no more</s> oh do not be afraid for me or melt too much lest i should melt also</s> i have an escort waiting over yonder hill</s>  there thank you for yourwater macumazahn and good night</s>  doubtless we shall meet again erelong and i forgot the little wise one said he would like to have atalk with you</s>  good night macumazahn good night</s>  i trust that you dida profitable trade with umbezi my father and masapo my husband</s>  i wonderwhy such men as these should have been chosen to be my father and myhusband</s>  think it over macumazahn and tell me when next we meet</s>  giveme that pretty mirror macumazahn when i look in it i shall see youas well as myself and that will please meyou dont know how much</s>  ithank you</s>  good night</s> in another minute i was watching her solitary little figure now wrappedagain in the hooded kaross as it vanished over the brow of the risebehind us and really as she went i felt a lump rising in my throat</s> notwithstanding all her wickednessand i suppose she was wickedtherewas something horribly attractive about mameena</s> when she had gone taking my only lookingglass with her and the lumpin my throat had gone also i began to wonder how much fact there was inher story</s>  she had protested so earnestly that she told me all the truththat i felt sure there must be something left behind</s>  also i rememberedshe had said zikali wanted to see me</s>  well the end of it was i took amoonlight walk up that dreadful gorge into which not even scowl wouldaccompany me because he declared that the place was well known to behaunted by imikovu or spectres who have been raised from the dead bywizards</s> it was a long and disagreeable walk and somehow i felt very depressedand insignificant as i trudged on between those gigantic cliffs passingnow through patches of bright moonlight and now through deep pools ofshadow threading my way among clumps of bush or round the bases of tallpillars of piledup stones till at length i came to the overhangingcliffs at the end which frowned down on me like the brows of sometitanic demon</s> well i got to the end at last and at the gate of the kraal fence wasmet by one of those fierce and huge men who served the dwarf as guards</s> suddenly he emerged from behind a stone and having scanned me fora moment in silence beckoned to me to follow him as though i wereexpected</s>  a minute later i found myself face to face with zikali whowas seated in the clear moonlight just outside the shadow of his hutand engaged apparently in his favourite occupation of carving woodwith a rough native knife of curious shape</s> for a while he took no notice of me then suddenly looked up shakingback his braided grey locks and broke into one of his great laughs</s> so it is you macumazahn he said</s>  well i knew you were passing myway and that mameena would send you here</s>  but why do you come to see thethingthatshouldnothavebeenborn</s>  to tell me how you fared withthe buffalo with the split horn eh</s> no zikali for why should i tell you what you know already</s>  mameenasaid you wished to talk with me that was all</s> then mameena lied he answered as is her nature in whose throatlive four false words for every one of truth</s>  still sit downmacumazahn</s>  there is beer made ready for you by that stool and give methe knife and a pinch of the white mans snuff that you have brought forme as a present</s> i produced these articles though how he knew that i had them with mei cannot tell nor did i think it worth while to inquire</s>  the snuff iremember pleased him very much but of the knife he said that it wasa pretty toy but he would not know how to use it</s>  then we fell totalking</s> what was mameena doing here</s>  i asked boldly</s> what was she doing at your wagons</s>  he asked</s>  oh do not stop to tellme i know i know</s>  that is a very good snake of yours macumazahnwhich always just lets you slip through her fingers when if shechose to close her hand well well i do not betray the secrets ofmy clients but i say this to yougo on to the kraal of the son ofsenzangakona and you will see things happen that will make you laughfor mameena will be there and the mongrel masapo her husband</s>  trulyshe hates him well and after all i would rather be loved than hatedby mameena though both are dangerous</s>  poor mongrel</s>  soon the jackalswill be chewing his bones</s> why do you say that</s>  i asked</s> only because mameena tells me that he is a great wizard and thejackals eat many wizards in zululand</s>  also he is an enemy of pandashouse is he not</s> you have been giving her some bad counsel zikali i said blurtingout the thought in my mind</s> perhaps perhaps macumazahn only i may call it good counsel</s>  i havemy own road to walk and if i can find some to clear away the thornsthat would prick my feet what of it</s>  also she will get her pay whofinds life dull up there among the amasomi with one she hates for ahutfellow</s>  go you and watch and afterwards when you have an hour tospare come and tell me what happensthat is if i do not chance to bethere to see for myself</s> is saduko well</s>  i asked to change the subject for i did not wish tobecome privy to the plots that filled the air</s> i am told that his tree grows great that it overshadows all the royalkraal</s>  i think that mameena wishes to sleep in the shade of it</s>  and nowyou are weary and so am i</s>  go back to your wagons macumazahn for ihave nothing more to say to you tonight</s>  but be sure to return and tellme what chances at pandas kraal</s>  or as i have said perhaps i shallmeet you there</s>  who knows who knows</s> now it will be observed that there was nothing very remarkable in thisconversation between zikali and myself</s>  he did not tell me any deepsecrets or make any great prophecy</s>  it may be wondered indeed whenthere is so much to record why i set it down at all</s> my answer is because of the extraordinary impression that it producedupon me</s>  although so little was said i felt all the while that thosefew words were a veil hiding terrible events to be</s>  i was sure thatsome dreadful scheme had been hatched between the old dwarf and mameenawhereof the issue would soon become apparent and that he had sent meaway in a hurry after he learned that she had told me nothing becausehe feared lest i should stumble on its cue and perhaps cause it to fail</s> at any rate as i walked back to my wagons by moonlight down thatdreadful gorge the hot thick air seemed to me to have a physical tasteand smell of blood and the dank foliage of the tropical trees that grewthere when now and again a puff of wind stirred them moaned like thefabled imikovu or as men might do in their last faint agony</s>  the effectupon my nerves was quite strange for when at last i reached my wagons iwas shaking like a reed and a cold perspiration unnatural enough uponthat hot night poured from my face and body</s> well i took a couple of stiff tots of squareface to pull myselftogether and at length went to sleep to awake before dawn with aheadache</s>  looking out of the wagon to my surprise i saw scowl and thehunters who should have been snoring standing in a group and talkingto each other in frightened whispers</s>  i called scowl to me and askedwhat was the matter</s> nothing baas he said with a shamefaced air only there are so manyspooks about this place</s>  they have been passing in and out of it allnight</s> spooks you idiot</s>  i answered</s>  probably they were people going tovisit the nyanga zikali</s> perhaps baas only then we do not know why they should all look likedead peopleprinces some of them by their dressand walk upon theair a mans height from the ground</s> pooh</s>  i replied</s>  do you not know the difference between owls in themist and dead kings</s>  make ready for we trek at once the air here isfull of fever</s> certainly baas he said springing off to obey and i do not think iever remember two wagons being got under way quicker than they were thatmorning</s> i merely mention this nonsense to show that the black kloof could affectother peoples nerves as well as my own</s> in due course i reached nodwengu without accident having sent forwardone of my hunters to report my approach to panda</s>  when my wagons arrivedoutside the great place they were met by none other than my old friendmaputa he who had brought me back the pills before our attack uponbangu</s> greeting macumazahn he said</s>  i am sent by the king to say that youare welcome and to point you out a good place to outspan also to giveyou permission to trade as much as you will in this town since he knowsthat your dealings are always fair</s> i returned my thanks in the usual fashion adding that i had brought alittle present for the king which i would deliver when it pleased himto receive me</s>  then i invited maputa to whom i also offered some triflewhich delighted him very much to ride with me on the wagonbox till wecame to the selected outspan</s> this by the way proved to be a very good place indeed a littlevalley full of grass for the cattlefor by the kings order it had notbeen grazedwith a stream of beautiful water running down it</s>  moreoverit overlooked a great open space immediately in front of the main gateof the town so that i could see everything that went on and all whoarrived or departed</s> you will be comfortable here macumazahn said maputa during yourstay which we hope will be long since although there will soon bea mighty crowd at nodwengu the king has given orders that none exceptyour own servants are to enter this valley</s> i thank the king but why will there be a crowd maputa</s> oh</s>  he answered with a shrug of the shoulders because of a newthing</s>  all the tribes of the zulus are to come up to be reviewed</s> some say that cetewayo has brought this about and some say that it isumbelazi</s>  but i am sure that it is the work of neither of these but ofsaduko your old friend though what his object is i cannot tell you</s> i only trust he added uneasily that it will not end in bloodshedbetween the great brothers</s> so saduko has grown tall maputa</s> tall as a tree macumazahn</s>  his whisper in the kings ear is louderthan the shouts of others</s>  moreover he has become a selfeater thatis a zulu term which means one who is very haughty</s>  you will have towait on him macumazahn he will not wait on you</s> is it so</s>  i answered</s>  well tall trees are blown down sometimes</s> he nodded his wise old head</s>  yes macumazahn i have seen plenty growand fall in my time for at last the swimmer goes with the stream</s> anyhow you will be able to do a good trade among so many and whateverhappens none will harm you whom all love</s>  and now farewell i bear yourmessages to the king who sends an ox for you to kill lest you shouldgrow hungry in his house</s> that same evening i saw saduko and the others as i shall tell</s>  i hadbeen up to visit the king and give him my present a case of englishtableknives with bone handles which pleased him greatly althoughhe did not in the least know how to use them</s>  indeed without theiraccompanying forks these are somewhat futile articles</s>  i found the oldfellow very tired and anxious but as he was surrounded by indunas ihad no private talk with him</s>  seeing that he was busy i took my leaveas soon as i could and when i walked away whom should i meet butsaduko</s> i saw him while he was a good way off advancing towards the inner gatewith a train of attendants like a royal personage and knew very wellthat he saw me</s>  making up my mind what to do at once i walked straighton to him forcing him to give me the path which he did not wish todo before so many people and brushed past him as though he were astranger</s>  as i expected this treatment had the desired effect forafter we had passed each other he turned and saiddo you not know me macumazahn</s> who calls</s>  i asked</s>  why friend your face is familiar to me</s>  how areyou named</s> have you forgotten saduko</s>  he said in a pained voice</s> no no of course not i answered</s>  i know you now although you seemsomewhat changed since we went out hunting and fighting togetherisuppose because you are fatter</s>  i trust that you are well saduko</s> goodbye</s>  i must be going back to my wagons</s>  if you wish to see me youwill find me there</s> these remarks i may add seemed to take saduko very much aback</s>  at anyrate he found no reply to them even when old maputa with whom i waswalking and some others sniggered aloud</s>  there is nothing that zulusenjoy so much as seeing one whom they consider an upstart set in hisplace</s> well a couple of hours afterwards just as the sun was sinking whoshould walk up to my wagons but saduko himself accompanied by a womanwhom i recognised at once as his wife the princess nandie who carrieda fine baby boy in her arms</s>  rising i saluted nandie and offered her mycampstool which she looked at suspiciously and declined preferring toseat herself on the ground after the native fashion</s>  so i took it backagain and after i had sat down on it not before stretched out my handto saduko who by this time was quite humble and polite</s> well we talked away and by degrees without seeming too muchinterested in them i was furnished with a list of all the advancementswhich it had pleased panda to heap upon saduko during the past year</s>  intheir way they were remarkable enough for it was much as though somepenniless country gentleman in england had been promoted in that shortspace of time to be one of the premier peers of the kingdom and endowedwith great offices and estates</s>  when he had finished the count of themhe paused evidently waiting for me to congratulate him</s>  but all i saidwasby the heavens above i am sorry for you saduko</s>  how many enemiesyou must have made</s>  what a long way there will be for you to fall onenight</s> a remark at which the quiet nandie broke into a low laugh thati think pleased her husband even less than my sarcasm</s>  well i wenton i see that you have got a baby which is much better than all thesetitles</s>  may i look at it inkosazana</s> of course she was delighted and we proceeded to inspect the babywhich evidently she loved more than anything on earth</s>  whilst we wereexamining the child and chatting about it saduko sitting by meanwhilein the sulks who on earth should appear but mameena and her fat andsullenlooking husband the chief masapo</s> oh macumazahn she said appearing to notice no one else howpleased i am to see you after a whole long year</s> i stared at her and my jaw dropped</s>  then i recovered myself thinkingshe must have made a mistake and meant to say week</s> twelve moons she went on and macumazahn not one of them has goneby but i have thought of you several times and wondered if we shouldever meet again</s>  where have you been all this while</s> in many places i answered amongst others at the black kloof wherei called upon the dwarf zikali and lost my lookingglass</s> the nyanga zikali</s>  oh how often have i wished to see him</s>  but ofcourse i cannot for i am told he will not receive any women</s> i dont know i am sure i replied but you might try perhaps hewould make an exception in your favour</s> i think i will macumazahn she murmured whereon i collapsed intosilence feeling that things were getting beyond me</s> when i recovered myself a little it was to hear mameena greeting sadukowith much effusion and complimenting him on his rise in life whichshe said she had always foreseen</s>  this remark seemed to bowl out sadukoalso for he made no answer to it although i noticed that he couldnot take his eyes off mameenas beautiful face</s>  presently howeverhe seemed to become aware of masapo and instantly his whole demeanourchanged for it grew proud and even terrible</s>  masapo tendered him somegreeting whereon saduko turned upon him and saidwhat chief of the amasomi do you give the goodday to an umfokazanaand a mangy hyena</s>  why do you do this</s>  is it because the low umfokazanahas become a noble and the mangy hyena has put on a tigers coat</s>  andhe glared at him like a veritable tiger</s> masapo made no answer that i could catch</s>  muttering some inaudiblewords he turned to depart and in doing soquite innocently ithinkstruck nandie knocking her over on to her back and causingthe child to fall out of her arms in such fashion that its tender headstruck against a pebble with sufficient force to cause it to bleed</s> saduko leapt at him smiting him across the shoulders with the littlestick that he carried</s>  for a moment masapo paused and i thought thathe was going to show fight</s>  if he had any such intention however hechanged his mind for without a word or showing any resentment at theinsult which he had received he broke into a heavy run and vanishedamong the evening shadows</s>  mameena who had observed all broke intosomething else namely a laugh</s> piff</s>  my husband is big yet not brave she said but i do not thinkhe meant to hurt you woman</s> do you speak to me wife of masapo</s>  asked nandie with gentle dignityas she gained her feet and picked up the stunned child</s>  if so my nameand titles are the inkosazana nandie daughter of the black one and wifeof the lord saduko</s> your pardon replied mameena humbly for she was cowed at once</s>  i didnot know who you were inkosazana</s> it is granted wife of masapo</s>  macumazahn give me water i pray youthat i may bathe the head of my child</s> the water was brought and presently when the little one seemed allright again for it had only received a scratch nandie thanked me anddeparted to her own huts saying with a smile to her husband as shepassed that there was no need for him to accompany her as she hadservants waiting at the kraal gate</s>  so saduko stayed behind and mameenastayed also</s>  he talked with me for quite a long while for he had muchto tell me although all the time i felt that his heart was not in histalk</s>  his heart was with mameena who sat there and smiled continuallyin her mysterious way only putting in a word now and again as thoughto excuse her presence</s> at length she rose and said with a sigh that she must be going back towhere the amasomi were in camp as masapo would need her to see to hisfood</s>  by now it was quite dark although i remember that from time totime the sky was lit up by sheet lightning for a storm was brewing</s>  asi expected saduko rose also saying that he would see me on the morrowand went away with mameena walking like one who dreams</s> a few minutes later i had occasion to leave the wagons in order toinspect one of the oxen which was tied up by itself at a distancebecause it had shown signs of some sickness that might or might not becatching</s>  moving quietly as i always do from a hunters habit i walkedalone to the place where the beast was tethered behind some mimosathorns</s>  just as i reached these thorns the broad lightning shone outvividly and showed me saduko holding the unresisting shape of mameenain his arms and kissing her passionately</s> then i turned and went back to the wagons even more quietly than i hadcome</s> i should add that on the morrow i found out that after all there wasnothing serious the matter with my ox</s> chapter x</s>  the smellingoutafter these events matters went on quietly for some time</s>  i visitedsadukos hutsvery fine hutsabout the doors of which sat quite anumber of his tribesmen who seemed glad to see me again</s>  here i learnedfrom the lady nandie that her babe whom she loved dearly was none theworse for its little accident</s>  also i learned from saduko himself whocame in before i left attended like a prince by several notable menthat he had made up his quarrel with masapo and indeed apologised tohim as he found that he had not really meant to insult the princesshis wife having only thrust her over by accident</s>  saduko added indeedthat now they were good friends which was well for masapo a man whomthe king had no cause to like</s>  i said that i was glad to hear it andwent on to call upon masapo who received me with enthusiasm as alsodid mameena</s> here i noted with pleasure that this pair seemed to be on much betterterms than i understood had been the case in the past for mameena evenaddressed her husband on two separate occasions in very affectionatelanguage and fetched something that he wanted without waiting to beasked</s>  masapo too was in excellent spirits because as he told methe old quarrel between him and saduko was thoroughly made up theirreconciliation having been sealed by an interchange of gifts</s>  he addedthat he was very glad that this was the case since saduko was now oneof the most powerful men in the country who could harm him much if hechose especially as some secret enemy had put it about of late that hemasapo was an enemy of the kings house and an evildoer who practisedwitchcraft</s>  in proof of his new friendship however saduko had promisedthat these slanders should be looked into and their originator punishedif he or she could be found</s> well i congratulated him and took my departure thinking furiouslyas the frenchman says</s>  that there was a tragedy pending i was surethis weather was too calm to last the water ran so still because it waspreparing to leap down some hidden precipice</s> yet what could i do</s>  tell masapo i had seen his wife being embraced byanother man</s>  surely that was not my business it was masapos businessto attend to her conduct</s>  also they would both deny it and i had nowitness</s>  tell him that sadukos reconciliation with him was not sincereand that he had better look to himself</s>  how did i know it was notsincere</s>  it might suit sadukos book to make friends with masapo andif i interfered i should only make enemies and be called a liar who wasworking for some secret end</s> go to panda and confide my suspicions to him</s>  he was far too anxiousand busy about great matters to listen to me and if he did would onlylaugh at this tale of a petty flirtation</s>  no there was nothing to bedone except sit still and wait</s>  very possibly i was mistaken after alland things would smooth themselves out as they generally do</s> meanwhile the reviewing or whatever it may have been was inprogress and i was busy with my own affairs making hay while the sunshone</s>  so great were the crowds of people who came up to nodwengu thatin a week i had sold everything i had to sell in the two wagons thatwere mostly laden with cloth beads knives and so forth</s>  moreover theprices i got were splendid since the buyers bid against each other andbefore i was cleared out i had collected quite a herd of cattle alsoa quantity of ivory</s>  these i sent on to natal with one of the wagonsremaining behind myself with the other partly because panda asked meto do sofor now and again he would seek my advice on sundryquestionsand partly from curiosity</s>
there was plenty to be curious about up at nodwengu just then sinceno one was sure that civil war would not break out between the princescetewayo and umbelazi whose factions were present in force</s> it was averted for the time however by umbelazi keeping away from thegreat gathering under pretext of being sick and leaving saduko and someothers to watch his interests</s>  also the rival regiments were not allowedto approach the town at the same time</s>  so that public cloud passed overto the enormous relief of everyone especially of panda the king</s>  as tothe private cloud whereof this history tells it was otherwise</s> as the tribes came up to the great place they were reviewed and sentaway since it was impossible to feed so vast a multitude as would havecollected had they all remained</s>  thus the amasomi a small people whowere amongst the first to arrive soon left</s>  only for some reason whichi never quite understood masapo mameena and a few of masapos childrenand headmen were detained there though perhaps if she had chosenmameena could have given an explanation</s> well things began to happen</s>  sundry personages were taken ill andsome of them died suddenly and soon it was noted that all these peopleeither lived near to where masapos family was lodged or had at sometime or other been on bad terms with him</s>  thus saduko himself was takenill or said he was at any rate he vanished from public gaze for threedays and reappeared looking very sorry for himself though i could notobserve that he had lost strength or weight</s>  these catastrophes i passover however in order to come to the greatest of them which is one ofthe turning points of this chronicle</s> after recovering from his alleged sickness saduko gave a kind ofthanksgiving feast at which several oxen were killed</s>  i was present atthis feast or rather at the last part of it for i only put in what maybe called a complimentary appearance having no taste for such nativegorgings</s>  as it drew near its close saduko sent for nandie who atfirst refused to come as there were no women presenti think because hewished to show his friends that he had a princess of the royal bloodfor his wife who had borne him a son that one day would be great in theland</s>  for saduko as i have said had become a selfeater and thisday his pride was inflamed by the adulation of the company and by thebeer that he had drunk</s> at length nandie did come carrying her babe from which she never wouldbe parted</s>  in her dignified ladylike fashion although it seems an oddterm to apply to a savage i know none that describes her better shegreeted first me and then sundry of the other guests saying a few wordsto each of them</s>  at length she came opposite to masapo who had dinednot wisely but too well and to him out of her natural courtesy spokerather longer than to the others inquiring after his wife mameena andothers</s>  at the moment it occurred to me that she did this in order toassure him that she bore no malice because of the accident of a whilebefore and was a party to her husbands reconciliation with him</s> masapo in a hazy way tried to reciprocate these kind intentions</s> rising to his feet his fat coarse body swaying to and fro because ofthe beer that he had drunk he expressed satisfaction at the feast thathad been prepared in her house</s>  then his eyes falling on the child hebegan to declaim about its size and beauty until he was stopped by themurmured protests of others since among natives it is held to be notfortunate to praise a young child</s>  indeed the person who does so is aptto be called an umtakati or bewitcher who will bring evil upon itshead a word that i heard murmured by several near to me</s>  not satisfiedwith this serious breach of etiquette the intoxicated masapo snatchedthe infant from its mothers arms under pretext of looking for the hurtthat had been caused to its brow when it fell to the ground at my campand finding none proceeded to kiss it with his thick lips</s> nandie dragged it from him sayingwould you bring death upon my son o chief of the amasomi</s> then turning she walked away from the feasters upon whom there fell acertain hush</s> fearing lest something unpleasant should ensue for i saw saduko bitinghis lips with rage not unmixed with fear and remembering masaposreputation as a wizard i took advantage of this pause to bid a generalgood night to the company and retire to my camp</s> what happened immediately after i left i do not know but just beforedawn on the following morning i was awakened from sleep in my wagon bymy servant scowl who said that a messenger had come from the huts ofsaduko begging that i would proceed there at once and bring the whitemans medicines as his child was very ill</s>  of course i got up and wenttaking with me some ipecacuanha and a few other remedies that i thoughtmight be suitable for infantile ailments</s> outside the huts which i reached just as the sun began to rise i wasmet by saduko himself who was coming to seek me as i saw at once in astate of terrible grief</s> what is the matter</s>  i asked</s> o macumazana he answered that dog masapo has bewitched my boy andunless you can save him he dies</s> nonsense i said why do you utter wind</s>  if the babe is sick it isfrom some natural cause</s> wait till you see it he replied</s> well i went into the big hut and there found nandie and some otherwomen also a native doctor or two</s>  nandie was seated on the floorlooking like a stone image of grief for she made no sound only pointedwith her finger to the infant that lay upon a mat in front of her</s> a single glance showed me that it was dying of some disease of whichi had no knowledge for its dusky little body was covered with redblotches and its tiny face twisted all awry</s>  i told the women to heatwater thinking that possibly this might be a case of convulsions whicha hot bath would mitigate but before it was ready the poor babe uttereda thin wail and died</s> then when she saw that her child was gone nandie spoke for the firsttime</s> the wizard has done his work well she said and flung herself facedownwards on the floor of the hut</s> as i did not know what to answer i went out followed by saduko</s> what has killed my son macumazahn</s>  he asked in a hollow voice thetears running down his handsome face for he had loved his firstborn</s> i cannot tell i replied but had he been older i should have thoughthe had eaten something poisonous which seems impossible</s> yes macumazahn and the poison that he has eaten came from the breathof a wizard whom you may chance to have seen kiss him last night</s>  wellhis life shall be avenged</s> saduko i exclaimed do not be unjust</s>  there are many sicknessesthat may have killed your son of which i have no knowledge who am not atrained doctor</s> i will not be unjust macumazahn</s>  the babe has died by witchcraftlike others in this town of late but the evildoer may not be he whom isuspect</s>  that is for the smellersout to decide and without more wordshe turned and left me</s> next day masapo was put upon his trial before a court of councillorsover which the king himself presided a very unusual thing for him todo and one which showed the great interest he took in the case</s> at this court i was summoned to give evidence and of course confinedmyself to answering such questions as were put to me</s>  practically thesewere but two</s>  what had passed at my wagons when masapo had knocked overnandie and her child and saduko had struck him and what had i seen atsadukos feast when masapo had kissed the infant</s>  i told them in as fewwords as i could and after some slight crossexamination by masapomade with a view to prove that the upsetting of nandie was an accidentand that he was drunk at sadukos feast to both of which suggestions iassented i rose to go</s>  panda however stopped me and bade me describethe aspect of the child when i was called in to give it medicine</s> i did so as accurately as possible and could see that my account madea deep impression on the mind of the court</s>  then panda asked me if i hadever seen any similar case to which i was obliged to replyno i have not</s> after this the councillors consulted privately and when we were calledback the king gave his judgment which was very brief</s>  it was evidenthe said that there had been events which might have caused enmity toarise in the mind of masapo against saduko by whom masapo had beenstruck with a stick</s>  therefore although a reconciliation had takenplace there seemed to be a possible motive for revenge</s>  but if masapokilled the child there was no evidence to show how he had done so</s> moreover that infant his own grandson had not died of any knowndisease</s>  he had however died of a similar disease to that which hadcarried off certain others with whom masapo had been mixed up whereasmore including saduko himself had been sick and recovered all ofwhich seemed to make a strong case against masapo</s> still he and his councillors wished not to condemn without full proof</s> that being so they had determined to call in the services of somegreat witchdoctor one who lived at a distance and knew nothing of thecircumstances</s>  who that doctor should be was not yet settled</s>  whenit was and he had arrived the case would be reopened and meanwhilemasapo would be kept a close prisoner</s>  finally he prayed that the whiteman macumazahn would remain at his town until the matter was settled</s> so masapo was led off looking very dejected and having saluted theking we all went away</s> i should add that except for the remission of the case to the courtof the witchdoctor which of course was an instance of pure kafirsuperstition this judgment of the kings seemed to me well reasoned andjust very different indeed from what would have been given by dingaanor chaka who were wont on less evidence to make a clean sweep notonly of the accused but of all his family and dependents</s> about eight days later during which time i had heard nothing of thematter and seen no one connected with it for the whole thing seemed tohave become zilathat is not to be talked abouti received a summonsto attend the smellingout and went wondering what witchdoctor hadbeen chosen for that bloody and barbarous ceremony</s>  indeed i had notfar to go since the place selected for the occasion was outside thefence of the town of nodwengu on that great open stretch of groundwhich lay at the mouth of the valley where i was camped</s>  here as iapproached i saw a vast multitude of people crowded together fiftydeep or more round a little oval space not much larger than the pitof a theatre</s>  on the inmost edge of this ring were seated many notablepeople male and female and as i was conducted to the side of it whichwas nearest to the gate of the town i observed among them sadukomasapo mameena and others and mixed up with them a number of soldierswho were evidently on duty</s> scarcely had i seated myself on a campstool carried by my servantscowl when through the gate of the kraal issued panda and certainof his council whose appearance the multitude greeted with the royalsalute of bayte that came from them in a deep and simultaneous roarof sound</s>  when its echoes died away in the midst of a deep silencepanda spoke sayingbring forth the nyanga doctor</s>  let the umhlahlo that is thewitchtrial begin</s> there was a long pause and then in the open gateway appeared a solitaryfigure that at first sight seemed to be scarcely human the figure ofa dwarf with a gigantic head from which hung long white hair plaitedinto locks</s>  it was zikali no other</s> quite unattended and naked save for his moocha for he had on him noneof the ordinary paraphernalia of the witchdoctor he waddled forwardwith a curious toadlike gait till he had passed through the councillorsand stood in the open space of the ring</s>  halting there he looked abouthim slowly with his deepset eyes turning as he looked till at lengthhis glance fell upon the king</s> what would you have of me son of senzangakona</s>  he asked</s>  many yearshave passed since last we met</s>  why do you drag me from my hut i whohave visited the kraal of the king of the zulus but twice since theblack one chaka sat upon the throneonce when the boers were killedby him who went before you and once when i was brought forth to seeall who were left of my race shoots of the royal dwandwe stock slainbefore my eyes</s>  do you bear me hither that i may follow them into thedarkness o child of senzangakona</s>  if so i am ready only then i havewords to say that it may not please you to hear</s> his deep rumbling voice echoed into silence while the great audiencewaited for the kings answer</s>  i could see that they were all afraid ofthis man yes even panda was afraid for he shifted uneasily upon hisstool</s>  at length he spoke sayingnot so o zikali</s>  who would wish to do hurt to the wisest and mostancient man in all the land to him who touches the far past with onehand and the present with the other to him who was old before ourgrandfathers began to be</s>  nay you are safe you on whom not even theblack one dared to lay a finger although you were his enemy and hehated you</s>  as for the reason why you have been brought here tell itto us o zikali</s>  who are we that we should instruct you in the ways ofwisdom</s> when the dwarf heard this he broke into one of his great laughs</s> so at last the house of senzangakona acknowledges that i have wisdom</s> then before all is done they will think me wise indeed</s> he laughed again in his illomened fashion and went on hurriedly asthough he feared that he should be called upon to explain his wordswhere is the fee</s>  where is the fee</s>  is the king so poor that he expectsan old dwandwe doctor to divine for nothing just as though he wereworking for a private friend</s> panda made a motion with his hand and ten fine heifers were driven intothe circle from some place where they had been kept in waiting</s> sorry beasts</s>  said zikali contemptuously compared to those we usedto breed before the time of senzangakonaa remark which caused a loudwow</s>  of astonishment to be uttered by the multitude that heard it</s> still such as they are let them be taken to my kraal with a bullfor i have none</s> the cattle were driven away and the ancient dwarf squatted himself downand stared at the ground looking like a great black toad</s>  for a longwhilequite ten minutes i should thinkhe stared thus till i forone watching him intently began to feel as though i were mesmerised</s> at length he looked up tossing back his grey locks and saidi see many things in the dust</s>  oh yes it is alive it is alive andtells me many things</s>  show that you are alive o dust</s>  look</s> as he spoke throwing his hands upwards there arose at his very feetone of those tiny and incomprehensible whirlwinds with which all whoknow south africa will be familiar</s>  it drove the dust together itlifted it in a tall spiral column that rose and rose to a height offifty feet or more</s>  then it died away as suddenly as it had come sothat the dust fell down again over zikali over the king and over threeof his sons who sat behind him</s>  those three sons i remember were namedtshonkweni dabulesinye and mantantashiya</s>  as it chanced by a strangecoincidence all of these were killed at the great battle of the tugelaof which i have to tell</s> now again an exclamation of fear and wonder rose from the audience whoset down this lifting of the dust at zikalis very feet not to naturalcauses but to the power of his magic</s>  moreover those on whom it hadfallen including the king rose hurriedly and shook and brushed itfrom their persons with a zeal that was not i think inspired by a meredesire for cleanliness</s>  but zikali only laughed again in his terriblefashion and let it lie on his freshoiled body which it turned to thedull dead hue of a grey adder</s> he rose and stepping here and there examined the newfallen dust</s>  thenhe put his hand into a pouch he wore and produced from it a dried humanfinger whereof the nail was so pink that i think it must have beencoloureda sight at which the circle shuddered</s> be clever he said o finger of her i loved best be clever and writein the dust as yonder macumazana can write and as some of the dwandweused to write before we became slaves and bowed ourselves down beforethe great heavens</s>  by this he meant the zulus whose name meansthe heavens</s>  be clever dear finger which caressed me once me thethingthatshouldnothavebeenborn as more will think before i dieand write those matters that it pleases the house of senzangakona toknow this day</s> then he bent down and with the dead finger at three separate spots madecertain markings in the fallen dust which to me seemed to consist ofcircles and dots and a strange and horrid sight it was to see him doit</s> i thank you dear finger</s>  now sleep sleep your work is done andslowly he wrapped the relic up in some soft material and restored it tohis pouch</s> then he studied the first of the markings and asked what am i herefor</s>  what am i here for</s>  does he who sits upon the throne desire to knowhow long he has to reign</s> now those of the inner circle of the spectators who at thesesmellingsout act as a kind of chorus looked at the king and seeingthat he shook his head vigorously stretched out their right handsholding the thumb downwards and said simultaneously in a cold lowvoiceizwa</s>  that is we hear you</s> zikali stamped upon this set of markings</s> it is well he said</s>  he who sits upon the throne does not desire toknow how long he has to reign and therefore the dust has forgotten andshows it not to me</s> then he walked to the next markings and studied them</s> does the child of senzangakona desire to know which of his sons shalllive and which shall die aye and which of them shall sleep in his hutwhen he is gone</s> now a great roar of izwa</s>  accompanied by the clapping of hands rosefrom all the outer multitude who heard for there was no informationthat the zulu people desired so earnestly as this at the time of which iwrite</s> but again panda who i saw was thoroughly alarmed at the turn thingswere taking shook his head vigorously whereon the obedient chorusnegatived the question in the same fashion as before</s> zikali stamped upon the second set of markings sayingthe people desire to know but the great ones are afraid to learn andtherefore the dust has forgotten who in the days to come shall sleep inthe hut of the king and who shall sleep in the bellies of the jackalsand the crops of the vultures after they have gone beyond by thebridge of spears</s> now at this awful speech which both because of all that it implied ofbloodshed and civil war and of the wild wailing voice in which it wasspoken that seemed quite different from zikalis caused everyone whoheard it including myself i am afraid to gasp and shiver the kingsprang from his stool as though to put a stop to such doctoring</s>  thenafter his fashion he changed his mind and sat down again</s>  but zikalitaking no heed went to the third set of marks and studied them</s> it would seem he said that i am awakened from sleep in my blackhouse yonder to tell of a very little matter that might well have beendealt with by any common nyanga born but yesterday</s>  well i have takenmy fee and i will earn it although i thought that i was brought hereto speak of great matters such as the death of princes and the fortunesof peoples</s>  is it desired that my spirit should speak of wizardries inthis town of nodwengu</s> izwa</s>  said the chorus in a loud voice</s> zikali nodded his great head and seemed to talk with the dust waitingnow and again for an answer</s> good he said they are many and the dust has told them all to me</s> oh they are very manyand he glared around himso many that if ispoke them all the hyenas of the hills would be full tonighthere the audience began to show signs of great apprehension</s> but looking down at the dust and turning his head sideways whatdo you say what do you say</s>  speak more plainly little voices for youknow i grow deaf</s>  oh</s>  now i understand</s>  the matter is even smaller thani thought</s>  just of one wizardizwa</s>  loudly</s> just of a few deaths and some sicknesses</s> izwa</s> just of one death one principal

child a child in whom ran the blood of the father of thezulus he who was my friend</s>  the blood of senzangakona the blood of theblack one the blood of panda</s> he stopped while both from the chorus and from the thousands of thecircle gathered around went up one roar of izwa</s>  emphasised by amighty movement of outstretched arms and downpointing thumbs</s> then silence during which zikali stamped upon all the remainingmarkings sayingi thank you o dust though i am sorry to have troubled you for sosmall a matter</s>  so so he went on presently a royal boychildis dead and you think by witchcraft</s>  let us find out if he died bywitchcraft or as others die by command of the heavens that need them</s> what</s>  here is one mark which i have left</s>  look</s>  it grows red it is fullof spots</s>  the child died with a twisted face</s> izwa</s>  izwa</s>  izwa</s>  crescendo</s> this death was not natural</s>  now was it witchcraft or was it poison</s> both i think both</s>  and whose was the child</s>  not that of a son of theking i think</s>  oh yes you hear me people you hear me but be silenti do not need your help</s>  no not of a son of a daughter then</s>  heturned and looked about him till his eye fell upon a group of womenamongst whom sat nandie dressed like a common person</s>  of a daughtera daughter he walked to the group of women</s>  why none of these areroyal they are the children of low people</s>  and yetand yet i seem tosmell the blood of senzangakona</s> he sniffed at the air as a dog does and as he sniffed drew ever nearerto nandie till at last he laughed and pointed to her</s> your child princess whose name i do not know</s>  your firstborn childwhom you loved more than your own heart</s> she rose</s> yes yes nyanga she cried</s>  i am the princess nandie and he was mychild whom i loved more than my own heart</s> haha</s>  said zikali</s>  dust you did not lie to me</s>  my spirit you didnot lie to me</s>  but now tell me dustand tell me my spiritwhokilled this child</s> he began to waddle round the circle an extraordinary sight coveredas he was with grey grime varied with streaks of black skin where theperspiration had washed the dust away</s> presently he came opposite to me and to my dismay paused sniffing atme as he had at nandie</s> ah</s>  ah</s>  o macumazana he said you have something to do with thismatter a saying at which all that audience pricked their ears</s> then i rose up in wrath and fear knowing my position to be one of somedanger</s> wizard or smellerout of wizards whichever you name yourself icalled

think that you who are wise like me know who did kill it</s> wont you tell me macumazahn</s>  no</s>  then i must find out for myself</s>  beat peace</s>  does not all the land know that your hands are white as yourheart</s> then to my great relief he passed on amidst a murmur of approbationfor as i have said the zulus liked me</s>  round and round he wanderedto my surprise passing both mameena and masapo without taking anyparticular note of them although he scanned them both and i thoughtthat i saw a swift glance of recognition pass between him and mameena</s> it was curious to watch his progress for as he went those in front ofhim swayed in their terror like corn before a puff of wind and when hehad passed they straightened themselves as the corn does when the windhas gone by</s> at length he had finished his journey and returned to hisstartingpoint to all appearance completely puzzled</s> you keep so many wizards at your kraal king he said addressingpanda that it is hard to say which of them wrought this deed</s>  it wouldhave been easier to tell you of greater matters</s>  yet i have taken yourfee and i must earn iti must earn it</s>  dust you are dumb</s>  now myidhlozi my spirit do you speak</s>  and holding his head sidewayshe turned his left ear up towards the sky then said presently in acurious matteroffact voiceah</s>  i thank you spirit</s>  well king your grandchild was killed by thehouse of masapo your enemy chief of the amasomi</s> now a roar of approbation went up from the audience among whom masaposguilt was a foregone conclusion</s> when this had died down panda spoke sayingthe house of masapo is a large house i believe that he has severalwives and many children</s>  it is not enough to smell out the house sincei am not as those who went before me were nor will i slay the innocentwith the guilty</s>  tell us o openerofroads who among the house ofmasapo has wrought this deed</s> thats just the question grumbled zikali in a deep voice</s>  all thati know is that it was done by poisoning and i smell the poison</s>  it ishere</s> then he walked to where mameena sat and cried outseize that woman and search her hair</s> executioners who were in waiting sprang forward but mameena waved themaway</s> friends she said with a little laugh there is no need to touchme and rising she stepped forward to the centre of the ring</s>  herewith a few swift motions of her hands she flung off first the cloak shewore then the moocha about her middle and lastly the fillet that boundher long hair and stood before that audience in all her naked beautyawondrous and a lovely sight</s> now she said let women come and search me and my garments and seeif there is any poison hid there</s> two old crones stepped forwardthough i do not know who sent themandcarried out a very thorough examination finally reporting that they hadfound nothing</s>  thereon mameena with a shrug of her shoulders resumedsuch clothes as she wore and returned to her place</s> zikali appeared to grow angry</s>  he stamped upon the ground with his bigfeet he shook his braided grey locks and cried outis my wisdom to be defeated in such a little matter</s>  one of you tie abandage over my eyes</s> now a manit was maputa the messengercame out and did so and inoted that he tied it well and tight</s>  zikali whirled round upon hisheels first one way and then another and crying aloud guide me myspirit</s>  marched forward in a zigzag fashion as a blindfolded man doeswith his arms stretched out in front of him</s>  first he went to the rightthen to the left and then straight forward till at length to myastonishment he came exactly opposite the spot where masapo sat andstretching out his great groping hands seized the kaross with which hewas covered and with a jerk tore it from him</s> search this</s>  he cried throwing it on the ground and a womansearched</s> presently she uttered an exclamation and from among the fur of one ofthe tails of the kaross produced a tiny bag that appeared to be made outof the bladder of a fish</s>  this she handed to zikali whose eyes had nowbeen unbandaged</s> he looked at it then gave it to maputa sayingthere is the poisonthere is the poison but who gave it i do not say</s> i am weary</s>  let me go</s> then none hindering him he walked away through the gate of the kraal</s> soldiers seized upon masapo while the multitude roared kill thewizard</s> masapo sprang up and running to where the king sat flung himself uponhis knees protesting his innocence and praying for mercy</s>  i also whohad doubts as to all this business ventured to rise and speak</s> o king i said as one who has known this man in the past i pleadwith you</s>  how that powder came into his kaross i know not but perchanceit is not poison only harmless dust</s> yes it is but wood dust which i use for the cleaning of my nailscried masapo for he was so terrified i think he knew not what he said</s> so you own to knowledge of the medicine</s>  exclaimed panda</s>  thereforenone hid it in your kaross through malice</s> masapo began to explain but what he said was lost in a mighty roar ofkill the wizard</s> panda held up his hand and there was silence</s> bring milk in a dish commanded the king and it was brought and ata further word from him dusted with the powder</s> now o macumazana said panda to me if you still think that yonderman is innocent will you drink this milk</s> i do not like milk o king i answered shaking my head whereon allwho heard me laughed</s> will mameena his wife drink it then</s>  asked panda</s> she also shook her head sayingo king i drink no milk that is mixed with dust</s> just then a lean white dog one of those homeless mangy beasts thatstray about kraals and live upon carrion wandered into the ring</s>  pandamade a sign and a servant going to where the poor beast stood staringabout it hungrily set down the wooden dish of milk in front of it</s> instantly the dog lapped it up for it was starving and as it finishedthe last drop the man slipped a leathern thong about its neck and heldit fast</s> now all eyes were fixed upon the dog mine among them</s>  presently thebeast uttered a long and melancholy howl which thrilled me through fori knew it to be masapos death warrant then began to scratch the groundand foam at the mouth</s>  guessing what would follow i rose bowed to theking and walked away to my camp which it will be remembered was setup in a little kloof commanding this place at a distance only of a fewhundred yards</s>  so intent was all the multitude upon watching the dogthat i doubt whether anyone saw me go</s>  as for that poor beast scowlwho stayed behind told me that it did not die for about ten minutessince before its end a red rash appeared upon it similar to that which ihad seen upon sadukos child and it was seized with convulsions</s> well i reached my tent unmolested and having lit my pipe engagedmyself in making business entries in my notebook in order to divert mymind as much as i could when suddenly i heard a most devilish clamour</s> looking up i saw masapo running towards me with a speed that i shouldhave thought impossible in so fat a man while after him raced thefiercefaced executioners and behind came the mob</s> kill the evildoer</s>  they shouted</s> masapo reached me</s>  he flung himself on his knees before me gaspingsave me macumazahn</s>  i am innocent</s>  mameena the witch</s>  mameenahe got no farther for the slayers had leapt on him like hounds upon abuck and dragged him from me</s> then i turned and covered up my eyes</s> next morning i left nodwengu without saying goodbye to anyone for whathad happened there made me desire a change</s>  my servant scowl and oneof my hunters remained however to collect some cattle that were stilldue to me</s> a month or more later when they joined me in natal bringing thecattle they told me that mameena the widow of masapo had entered thehouse of saduko as his second wife</s>  in answer to a question which i putto them they added that it was said that the princess nandie didnot approve of this choice of saduko which she thought would not befortunate for him or bring him happiness</s>  as her husband seemed to bemuch enamoured of mameena however she had waived her objections andwhen panda asked if she gave her consent had told him that although shewould prefer that saduko should choose some other woman who had not beenmixed up with the wizard who killed her child she was prepared to takemameena as her sister and would know how to keep her in her place</s> chapter xi</s>  the sin of umbelaziabout eighteen months had gone by and once again in the autumn of theyear 1856 i found myself at old umbezis kraal where there seemed tobe an extraordinary market for any kind of gaspipe that could be calleda gun</s>  well as a trader who could not afford to neglect profitablemarkets which are hard things to find there i was</s> now in eighteen months many things become a little obscured in onesmemory especially if they have to do with savages in whom after allone takes only a philosophical and a business

first person that i metat some distancefrom the kraal where i suppose she had been taking a country walkwasthe beautiful mameena herself</s>  there she was looking quite unchangedand as lovely as ever

old lover of mine has become a new husband</s>  youknow whom i meansaduko</s>  after the death of that evildoer masapo hegrew very urgent and the king also the inkosazana nandie pressed iton me and so i yielded</s>  also to be honest saduko was a good match orseemed to be so</s> by now we were walking side by side for the train of wagons had goneahead to the old outspan</s>  so i stopped and looked her in the face</s> seemed to be i repeated</s>
 areyou not happy this time</s> not altogether macumazahn she answered with a shrug of hershoulders</s>  saduko is very fond of mefonder than i like indeed sinceit causes him to neglect nandie who by the way has another son andalthough she says little that makes nandie cross</s>  in short she addedwith a burst of truth i am the plaything nandie is the great ladyand that place suits me ill</s> if you love saduko you should not mind mameena</s> love she said bitterly</s>  piff</s>  what is love</s>  but i have asked youthat question once before</s> why are you here mameena</s>  i inquired leaving it unanswered</s> because saduko is here and of course nandie for she never leaveshim and he will not leave me because the prince umbelazi is comingbecause there are plots afoot and the great war draws nearthat war inwhich so many must die</s> between cetewayo and umbelazi mameena</s> aye between cetewayo and umbelazi</s>  why do you suppose those wagons ofyours are loaded with guns for which so many cattle must be paid</s>  not toshoot game with i think</s>  well this little kraal of my fathers isjust now the headquarters of the umbelazi faction the isigqosa as theprincedom of gikazi is that of cetewayo</s>  my poor father</s>  she addedwith her characteristic shrug he thinks himself very great todayas he did after he had shot the elephantbefore i nursed youmacumazahnbut often i wonder what will be the end of itfor him andfor all of us macumazahn including yourself</s> i</s>  i answered</s>  what have i to do with your zulu quarrels</s> that you will know when you have done with them macumazahn</s>  but hereis the kraal and before we enter it i wish to thank you for trying toprotect that unlucky husband of mine masapo</s> i only did so mameena because i thought him innocent</s> i know macumazahn and so did i although as i always told you ihated him the man with whom my father forced me to marry</s>  but i amafraid from what i have learned since that he was not altogetherinnocent</s>  you see saduko had struck him which he could not forget</s> also he was jealous of saduko who had been my suitor and wished toinjure him</s>  but what i do not understand she added with a burst ofconfidence is why he did not kill saduko instead of his child</s> well mameena you may remember it was said he tried to do so</s> yes macumazahn i had forgotten that</s>  i suppose that he did try andfailed</s>  oh now i see things with both eyes</s>  look yonder is my father</s> i will go away</s>  but come and talk to me sometimes macumazahn forotherwise nandie will be careful that i should hear nothingi who amthe plaything the beautiful woman of the house who must sit and smilebut must not think</s> so she departed and i went on to meet old umbezi who came gambollingtowards me like an obese goat reflecting that whatever might be thetruth or otherwise of her story her advancement in the world did notseem to have brought mameena greater happiness and contentment</s> umbezi who greeted me warmly was in high spirits and full ofimportance</s>  he informed me that the marriage of mameena to saduko afterthe death of the wizard her husband whose tribe and cattle had beengiven to saduko in compensation for the loss of his son was a mostfortunate thing for him</s> i asked why</s> because as saduko grows great so i his fatherinlaw grow great withhim macumazahn especially as he has been liberal to me in the matterof cattle passing on to me a share of the herds of masapo so that iwho have been poor so long am getting rich at last</s>  moreover my kraalis to be honoured with a visit from umbelazi and some of his brotherstomorrow and saduko has promised to lift me up high when the prince isdeclared heir to the throne</s> which prince</s>  i asked</s> umbelazi macumazahn</s>  who else</s>  umbelazi who without doubt willconquer cetewayo</s> why without doubt umbezi</s>  cetewayo has a great following and if heshould conquer i think that you will only be lifted up in the crops ofthe vultures</s> at this rough suggestion umbezis fat face fell</s> o macumazana he said if i thought that i would go over tocetewayo although saduko is my soninlaw</s>  but it is not possiblesince the king loves umbelazis mother most of all his wives and as ichance to know has sworn to her that he favours umbelazis cause sincehe is the dearest to him of all his sons and will do everything thathe can to help him even to the sending of his own regiment to hisassistance if there should be need</s>  also it is said that zikaliopenerofroads who has all wisdom has prophesied that umbelazi willwin more than he ever hoped for</s> the king</s>  i said a straw blown hither and thither between two greatwinds waiting to be wafted to rest by that which is strongest</s>  theprophecy of zikali</s>  it seems to me that it can be read two ways ifindeed he ever made one</s>  well umbezi i hope that you are right foralthough it is no affair of mine who am but a white trader in yourcountry i like umbelazi better than cetewayo and think that he has akinder heart</s>  also as you have chosen his side i advise you to stickto it since traitors to a cause seldom come to any good whether itwins or loses</s>  and now will you take count of the guns and powder whichi have brought with me</s> ah</s>  better would it have been for umbezi if he had listened to my adviceand remained faithful to the leader he had chosen for then even if hehad lost his life at least he would have kept his good name</s>  but of himpresently as they say in pedigrees</s> next day i went to pay my respects to nandie whom i found engaged innursing her new baby and as quiet and stately in her demeanour as ever</s> still i think that she was very glad to see me because i had tried tosave the life of her first child whom she could not forget if for noother reason</s>  whilst i was talking to her of that sad matter also ofthe political state of the country as to which i think she wished tosay something to me mameena entered the hut without waiting to beasked and sat down whereon nandie became suddenly silent</s> this however did not trouble mameena who talked away about anythingand everything completely ignoring the headwife</s>  for a while nandiebore it with patience but at length she took advantage of a pause inthe conversation to say in her firm low voicethis is my hut daughter of umbezi a thing which you remember wellenough when it is a question whether saduko our husband shall visityou or me</s>  can you not remember it now when i would speak with the whitechief watcherbynight who has been so good as to take the trouble tocome to see me</s> on hearing these words mameena leapt up in a rage and i must say inever saw her look more lovely</s> you insult me daughter of panda as you always try to do because youare jealous of me</s> your pardon sister replied nandie</s>  why should i who am sadukosinkosikazi and as you say daughter of panda the king be jealousof the widow of the wizard masapo and the daughter of the headmanumbezi whom it has pleased our husband to take into his house to be thecompanion of his leisure</s> why</s>  because you know that saduko loves my little finger more thanhe does your whole body although you are of the kings blood and haveborne him brats she answered looking at the infant with no kindlyeye</s> it may be so daughter of umbezi for men have their fancies andwithout doubt you are fair</s>  yet i would ask you one thingif sadukoloves you so much how comes it he trusts you so little that you mustlearn any matter of weight by listening at my door as i found you doingthe other day</s> because you teach him not to do so o nandie</s>  because you are evertelling him not to consult with me since she who has betrayed onehusband may betray another</s>  because you make him believe my place isthat of his toy not that of his companion and this although i amcleverer than you and all your house tied into one bundle as you mayfind out some day</s> yes answered nandie quite undisturbed i do teach him these thingsand i am glad that in this matter saduko has a thinking head and listensto me</s>  also i agree that it is likely i shall learn many more ill thingsthrough and of you one day daughter of umbezi</s>  and now as it is notgood that we should wrangle before this white lord again i say to youthat this is my hut in which i wish to speak alone with my guest</s> i go i go</s>  gasped mameena but i tell you that saduko shall hear ofthis</s> certainly he will hear of it for i shall tell him when he comestonight</s> another instant and mameena was gone having shot out of the hut like arabbit from its burrow</s> i ask your pardon macumazahn for what has happened said nandiebut it had become necessary that i should teach my sister mameenaupon which stool she ought to sit</s>  i do not trust her macumazahn</s>  ithink that she knows more of the death of my child than she chooses tosay she who wished to be rid of masapo for a reason you can guess</s>  ithink also she will bring shame and trouble upon saduko whom shehas bewitched with her beauty as she bewitches all menperhaps evenyourself a little macumazahn</s>  and now let us talk of other matters</s> to this proposition i agreed cordially since to tell the truth if icould have managed to do so with any decent grace i should have beenout of that hut long before mameena</s>  so we fell to conversing on thecondition of zululand and the dangers that lay ahead for all who wereconnected with the royal housea state of affairs which troubled nandiemuch for she was a clearheaded woman and one who feared the future</s> ah</s>  macumazahn she said to me as we parted i would that i were thewife of some man who did not desire to grow great and that no royalblood ran in my veins</s> on the next day the prince umbelazi arrived and with him saduko anda few other notable men</s>  they came quite quietly and without anyostensible escort although scowl my servant told me he heard thatthe bush at a little distance was swarming with soldiers of the isigqosaparty</s>  if i remember rightly the excuse for the visit was that umbezihad some of a certain rare breed of white cattle whereof the princewished to secure young bulls and heifers to improve his herd</s> once inside the kraal however umbelazi who was a very opennaturedman threw off all pretence and after greeting me heartily enoughtold me with plainness that he was there because this was a convenientspot on which to arrange the consolidation of his party</s> almost every hour during the next two weeks messengersmany of whomwere chiefs disguisedcame and went</s>  i should have liked to followtheir examplethat is so far as their departure was concernedfori felt that i was being drawn into a very dangerous vortex</s>  but asa matter of fact i could not escape since i was obliged to wait toreceive payment for my stuff which as usual was made in cattle</s> umbelazi talked with me a good deal at that time impressing upon me howfriendly he was towards the english white men of natal as distinguishedfrom the boers and what good treatment he was prepared to promise tothem should he ever attain to authority in zululand</s>  it was during oneof the earliest of these conversations which of course i saw had anultimate object that he met mameena i think for the first time</s> we were walking together in a little natural glade of the bush thatbordered one side of the kraal when at the end of it looking likesome wood nymph of classic fable in the light of the setting sunappeared the lovely mameena clothed only in her girdle of fur hernecklace of blue beads and some copper ornaments and carrying upon herhead a gourd</s> umbelazi noted her at once and ceasing his political talk of which hewas obviously tired asked me who that beautiful intombi that is girlmight be</s> she is not an intombi prince i answered</s>  she is a widow who isagain a wife the second wife of your friend and councillor saduko andthe daughter of your host umbezi</s> is it so macumazahn</s>  oh then i have heard of her though as itchances i have never met her before</s>  no wonder that my sister nandie isjealous for she is beautiful indeed</s> yes i answered she looks pretty against the red sky does she not</s> by now we were drawing near to mameena and i greeted her asking if shewanted anything</s> nothing macumazahn she answered in her delicate modest way fornever did i know anyone who could seem quite so modest as mameena andwith a swift glance of her shy eyes at the tall and splendid umbelazinothing</s>  only she added i was passing with the milk of one of thefew cows my father gave me and saw you and i thought that perhaps asthe day has been so hot you might like a drink of it</s> then lifting the gourd from her head she held it out to me</s> i thanked her drank somewho could do less</s> and returned it to herwhereon she made as though she would hasten to depart</s> may i not drink also daughter of umbezi</s>  asked umbelazi who couldscarcely take his eyes off her</s> certainly sir if you are a friend of macumazahn she repliedhanding him the gourd</s> i am that lady and more than that since i am a friend of yourhusband saduko also as you will know when i tell you that my name isumbelazi</s> i thought it must be so she replied because of yourof yourstature</s>  let the prince accept the offering of his servant who one dayhopes to be his subject and dropping upon her knee she held out thegourd to him</s>  over it i saw their eyes meet</s>  he drank and as he handedback the vessel she saido prince may i be granted a word with you</s>  i have that to tell whichyou would perhaps do well to hear since news sometimes reaches the earsof humble women that escapes those of the men our masters</s> he bowed his head in assent whereon taking a hint which mameena gaveme with her eyes i muttered something about business and made myselfscarce</s>  i may add that mameena must have had a great deal to tellumbelazi</s>  fully an hour and a half had gone by before by the light ofthe moon from a point of vantage on my wagonbox whence according tomy custom i was keeping a lookout on things in general i saw her slipback to the kraal silently as a snake followed at a little distance bythe towering form of umbelazi</s> apparently mameena continued to be the recipient of information whichshe found it necessary to communicate in private to the prince</s>  at anyrate on sundry subsequent evenings the dullness of my vigil on thewagonbox was relieved by the sight of her graceful figure gliding homefrom the kloof that umbelazi seemed to find a very suitable spotfor reflection after sunset</s>  on one of the last of these occasions iremember that nandie chanced to be with me having come to my wagon forsome medicine for her baby</s> what does it mean macumazahn</s>  she asked when the pair had gone byas they thought unobserved since we were standing where they could notsee us</s> i dont know and i dont want to know i answered sharply</s> neither do i macumazahn but without doubt we shall learn in time</s>  ifthe crocodile is patient and silent the buck always drops into its jawsat last</s> on the day after nandie made this wise remark saduko started on amission as i understood to win over several doubtful chiefs to thecause of indhlovuenesihlonti the elephantwiththetuftofhair asthe prince umbelazi was called among the zulus though not to his face</s> this mission lasted ten days and before it was concluded an importantevent happened at umbezis kraal</s> one evening mameena came to me in a great rage and said that she couldbear her present life no longer</s>  presuming on her rank and position asheadwife nandie treated her like a servantnay like a little dog tobe beaten with a stick</s>  she wished that nandie would die</s> it will be very unlucky for you if she does i answered for thenperhaps zikali will be summoned to look into the matter as he wasbefore</s> what was she to do she went on ignoring my remark</s> eat the porridge that you have made in your own pot or break the poti</s> e</s>  go away i suggested</s>  there was no need for you to marry sadukoany more than there was for you to marry masapo</s> how can you talk to me like that macumazahn she answered stampingher foot when you know well it is your fault if i married anyone</s> piff</s>  i hate them all and since my father would only beat me if i tookmy troubles to him i will run off and live in the wilderness alone andbecome a witchdoctoress</s> i am afraid you will find it very dull mameena i began in abantering tone for to tell the truth i did not think it wise to showher too much sympathy while she was so excited</s> mameena never waited for the end of the sentence but sobbing out thati was false and cruel she turned and departed swiftly</s>  oh</s>  little did iforesee how and where we should meet again</s> next morning i was awakened shortly after sunrise by scowl whom i hadsent out with another man the night before to look for a lost ox</s> well have you found the ox</s>  i asked</s> yes baas but i did not waken you to tell you that</s>  i have a messagefor you baas from mameena wife of saduko whom i met about four hoursago upon the plain yonder</s> i bade him set it out</s> these were the words of mameena baas say to macumazahn your masterthat indhlovuenesihlonti taking pity on my wrongs and loving mewith his heart has offered to take me into his house and that i haveaccepted his offer since i think it better to become the inkosazana ofthe zulus as i shall one day than to remain a servant in the houseof nandie</s>  say to macumazahn that when saduko returns he is to tell himthat this is all his fault since if he had kept nandie in her place iwould have died rather than leave him</s>  let him say to saduko also thatalthough from henceforth we can be no more than friends my heart isstill tender towards him and that by day and by night i will strive towater his greatness so that it may grow into a tree that shall shadethe land</s>  let macumazahn bid him not to be angry with me since what ido i do for his good as he would have found no happiness while nandieand i dwelt in one house</s>  above all also let him not be angry with theprince who loves him more than any man and does but travel whither thewind that i breathe blows him</s>  bid macumazahn think of me kindly as ishall of him while my eyes are open</s> i listened to this amazing message in silence then asked if mameena wasalone</s> no baas umbelazi and some soldiers were with her but they didnot hear her words for she stepped aside to speak with me</s>  then shereturned to them and they walked away swiftly and were swallowed up inthe night</s> very good sikauli i said</s>  make me some coffee and make it strong</s> i dressed and drank several cups of the coffee all the while thinkingwith my head as the zulus say</s>  then i walked up to the kraal to seeumbezi whom i found just coming out of his hut yawning</s> why do you look so black upon this beautiful morning macumazahn</s> asked the genial old scamp</s>  have you lost your best cow or what</s> no my friend i answered but you and another have lost your bestcow</s>  and word for word i repeated to him mameenas message</s>  when i hadfinished really i thought that umbezi was about to faint</s> curses be on the head of this mameena</s>  he exclaimed</s>  surely some evilspirit must have been her father not i and well was she called childof storm</s>  what shall i do now macumazahn</s>  thanks be to my spirithe added with an air of relief she is too far gone for me to try tocatch her also if i did umbelazi and his soldiers would kill me</s>   that if i have not said so already was the meaning  which the zulus gave to the word mameena although as i  know the language i cannot get any such interpretation out  of the name i believe that it was given to her however  because she was born just before a terrible tempest when  the wind wailing round the hut made a sound like the word  mameena</s>  a</s>  q</s> and what will saduko do if you dont</s>  i asked</s> oh of course he will be angry for no doubt he is fond of her</s>  butafter all i am used to that</s>  you remember how he went mad when shemarried masapo</s>  at least he cannot say that i made her run away withumbelazi</s>  after all it is a matter which they must settle betweenthem</s> i think it may mean great trouble i said at a time when trouble isnot needed</s> oh why so macumazahn</s>  my daughter did not get on with the princessnandiewe could all see thatfor they would scarcely speak to eachother</s>  and if saduko is fond of herwell after all there are otherbeautiful women in zululand</s>  i know one or two of them myself whom iwill mention to sadukoor rather to nandie</s>  really as things were iam not sure but that he is well rid of her</s> but what do you think of the matter as her father</s>  i asked for iwanted to see to what length his accommodating morality would stretch</s> as her fatherwell of course macumazahn as her father i am sorrybecause it will mean talk will it not as the masapo businessdid</s>  still there is this to be said for mameena he added with abrightening face she always runs away up the tree not down</s>  when shegot rid of masapoi mean when masapo was killed for his witchcraftshemarried saduko who was a bigger mansaduko whom she would not marrywhen masapo was the bigger man</s>  and now when she has got rid of sadukoshe enters the hut of umbelazi who will one day be king of the zulusthe biggest man in all the world which means that she will be thebiggest woman for remember macumazahn she will walk round and roundthat great umbelazi till whatever way he looks he will see her and noone else</s>  oh she will grow great and carry up her poor old fatherin the blanket on her back</s>  oh the sun still shines behind the cloudmacumazahn so let us make the best of the cloud since we know that itwill break out presently</s>
you speak illomened words macumazahn words that take away myappetite which is generally excellent at this hour</s>  well if mameena isbad it is not my fault for i brought her up to be good</s>  after allhe added with an outburst of petulance why do you scold me when it isyour fault</s>  if you had run away with the girl when you might have doneso there would have been none of this trouble</s> perhaps not i answered only then i am sure i should have been deadtoday as i think that all who have to do with her will be ere long</s> and now umbezi i wish you a good breakfast</s> on the following morning saduko returned and was told the news bynandie whom i had carefully avoided</s>  on this occasion however i wasforced to be present as the person to whom the sinful mameena had senther farewell message</s>  it was a very painful experience of which i donot remember all the details</s>  for a while after he learned the truthsaduko sat still as a stone staring in front of him with a face thatseemed to have become suddenly old</s>  then he turned upon umbezi and in afew terrible words accused him of having arranged the matter in order toadvance his own fortunes at the price of his daughters dishonour</s>  nextwithout listening to his exfatherinlaws voluble explanations herose and said that he was going away to kill umbelazi the evildoer whohad robbed him of the wife he loved with the connivance of all three ofus and by a sweep of his hand he indicated umbezi the princess nandieand myself</s> this was more than i could stand so i too rose and asked him what hemeant adding in the irritation of the moment that if i had wished torob him of his beautiful mameena i thought i could have done so longagoa remark that staggered him a little</s> then nandie rose also and spoke in her quiet voice</s> saduko my husband she said i a princess of the zulu housemarried you who are not of royal blood because i loved you and althoughpanda the king and umbelazi the prince wished it for no other reasonwhatsoever</s>  well i have been faithful to you through some trials evenwhen you set the widow of a wizardif indeed as i have reason tosuspect she was not herself the wizardbefore me and although thatwizard had killed our son lived in her hut rather than in mine</s>  nowthis woman of whom you thought so much has deserted you for yourfriend and my brother the prince umbelaziumbelazi who is called thehandsome and who if the fortune of war goes with him as it may ormay not will succeed to panda my father</s>  this she has done because shealleges that i your inkosikazi and the kings daughter treated her asa servant which is a lie</s>  i kept her in her place no more who ifshe could have had her will would have ousted me from mine perhaps bydeath for the wives of wizards learn their arts</s>  on this pretext shehas left you but that is not her real reason</s>  she has left you becausethe prince my brother whom she has befooled with her tricks andbeauty as she has befooled others or tried toand she glanced atmeis a bigger man than you are</s>  you saduko may become great as myheart prays that you will but my brother may become a king</s>  she doesnot love him any more than she loved you but she does love the placethat may be his and therefore hersshe who would be the first doe ofthe herd</s>  my husband i think that you are well rid of mameena for ithink also that if she had stayed with us there would have been moredeaths in our house perhaps mine which would not matter and perhapsyours which would matter much</s>  all this i say to you not from jealousyof one who is fairer than i but because it is the truth</s>  therefore mycounsel to you is to let this business pass over and keep silent</s>  aboveall seek not to avenge yourself upon umbelazi since i am sure that hehas taken vengeance to dwell with him in his own hut</s>  i have spoken</s> that this moderate and reasoned speech of nandies produced a greateffect upon saduko i could see but at the time the only answer he madeto it waslet the name of mameena be spoken no more within hearing of my ears</s> mameena is dead</s> so her name was heard no more in the houses of saduko and of umbezi andwhen it was necessary for any reason to refer to her she was given anew name a composite zulu word owezulu i think it was which isstormchild shortly translated for zulu means a storm as well asthe sky</s> i do not think that saduko spoke of her to me again until towards theclimax of this history and certainly i did not mention her to him</s>  butfrom that day forward i noted that he was a changed man</s>  his pride andopen pleasure in his great success which had caused the zulus to namehim the selfeater were no longer marked</s>  he became cold and silentlike a man who is thinking deeply but who shutters his thoughts lestsome should read them through the windows of his eyes</s>  moreover he paida visit to zikali the little and wise as i found out by accident butwhat advice that cunning old dwarf gave to him i did not find outthen</s> the only other event which happened in connection with this elopementwas that a message came from umbelazi to saduko brought by one of theprinces a brother of umbelazi who was of his party</s>  as i know fori heard it delivered it was a very humble message when the relativepositions of the two men are consideredthat of one who knew that hehad done wrong and if not repentant was heartily ashamed of himself</s> saduko it said i have stolen a cow of yours and i hope you willforgive me since that cow did not love the pasture in your kraal butin mine she grows fat and is content</s>  moreover in return i will giveyou many other cows</s>  everything that i have to give i will give to youwho are my friend and trusted councillor</s>  send me word o saduko thatthis wall which i have built between us is broken down since ere longyou and i must stand together in war</s> to this message sadukos answer waso prince you are troubled about a very little thing</s>  that cow whichyou have taken was of no worth to me for who wishes to keep a beastthat is ever tearing and lowing at the gates of the kraal disturbingthose who would sleep inside with her noise</s>  had you asked her of mei would have given her to you freely</s>  i thank you for your offer but ineed no more cows especially if like this one they have no calves</s> as for a wall between us there is none for how can two men who if thebattle is to be won must stand shoulder to shoulder fight if dividedby a wall</s>  o son of the king i am dreaming by day and night of thebattle and the victory and i have forgotten all about the barren cowthat ran away after you the great bull of the herd</s>  only do not besurprised if one day you find that this cow has a sharp horn</s> chapter xii</s>  pandas prayerabout six weeks later in the month of november 1856 i chanced tobe at nodwengu when the quarrel between the princes came to a head</s> although none of the regiments was actually allowed to enter thetownthat is as a regimentthe place was full of people all of themin a state of great excitement who came in during the daytime and wentto sleep in the neighbouring military kraals at night</s>  one eveningas some of these soldiersabout a thousand of them if i rememberrightwere returning to the ukubaza kraal a fight occurred betweenthem which led to the final outbreak</s> as it happened at that time there were two separate regiments stationedat this kraal</s>  i think that they were the imkulutshana and the hlabaone of which favoured cetewayo and the other umbelazi</s>  as certaincompanies of each of these regiments marched along together in parallellines two of their captains got into dispute on the eternal subject ofthe succession to the throne</s>  from words they came to blows and the endof it was that he who favoured umbelazi killed him who favoured cetewayowith his kerry</s>  thereon the comrades of the slain man raising a shoutof usutu which became the warcry of cetewayos party fell upon theothers and a dreadful combat ensued</s>  fortunately the soldiers were onlyarmed with sticks or the slaughter would have been very great but asit was after an indecisive engagement about fifty men were killed andmany more injured</s> now with my usual bad luck i who had gone out to shoot a few birdsfor the potpauw or bustard i think they werewas returning acrossthis very plain to my old encampment in the kloof where masapo had beenexecuted and so ran into the fight just as it was beginning</s>  i saw thecaptain killed and the subsequent engagement</s>  indeed as it happened idid more</s>  not knowing where to go or what to do for i was quite alonei pulled up my horse behind a tree and waited till i could escape thehorrors about me for i can assure anyone who may ever read these wordsthat it is a very horrible sight to see a thousand men engaged in fierceand deadly combat</s>  in truth the fact that they had no spears and couldonly batter each other to death with their heavy kerries made it worsesince the duels were more desperate and prolonged</s> everywhere men were rolling on the ground hitting at each othersheads until at last some blow went home and one of them threw out hisarms and lay still either dead or senseless</s>  well there i sat watchingall this shocking business from the saddle of my trained shooting ponywhich stood like a stone till presently i became aware of two greatfellows rushing at me with their eyes starting out of their heads andshouting as they camekill umbelazis white man</s>  kill</s>  kill</s> then seeing that the matter was urgent and that it was a question of mylife or theirs i came into action</s> in my hand i held a doublebarrelled shotgun loaded with what we usedto call loopers or b</s> b</s>  shot of which but a few went to each chargefor i had hoped to meet with a small buck on my way to camp</s>  so asthese soldiers came i lifted the gun and fired the right barrel atone of them and the left barrel at the other aiming in each case at thecentre of the small dancing shields which from force of habit they heldstretched out to protect their throats and breasts</s>  at that distance ofcourse the loopers sank through the soft hide of the shields and deepinto the bodies of those who carried them so that both of them droppeddead the lefthand man being so close that he fell against my pony hisuplifted kerry striking me upon the thigh and bruising me</s> when i saw what i had done and that my danger was over for the momentwithout waiting to reload i dug the spurs into my horses sides andgalloped off to nodwengu passing between the groups of struggling men</s> on arriving unharmed at the town i went instantly to the royal huts anddemanded to see the king who sent word that i was to be admitted</s> on coming before him i told him exactly what had happenedthat i hadkilled two of cetewayos men in order to save my own life and on thataccount submitted myself to his justice</s> o macumazana said panda in great distress i know well that youare not to blame and already i have sent out a regiment to stop thisfighting with command that those who caused it should be brought beforeme tomorrow for judgment</s>  i am glad indeed macumazahn that you haveescaped without harm but i must tell you that i fear henceforth yourlife will be in danger since all the usutu party will hold it forfeitif they can catch you</s>  while you are in my town i can protect you for iwill set a strong guard about your camp but here you will have tostay until these troubles are done with since if you leave you may bemurdered on the road</s> i thank you for your kindness king i answered but all this is veryawkward for me who hoped to trek for natal tomorrow</s> well there it is macumazahn you will have to stay here unlessyou wish to be killed</s>  he who walks into a storm must put up with thehailstones</s> so it came about that once again fate dragged me into the zulumaelstrom</s> on the morrow i was summoned to the trial half as a witness and halfas one of the offenders</s>  going to the head of the nodwengu kraal wherepanda was sitting in state with his council i found the whole greatspace in front of him crowded with a dense concourse of fiercefacedpartisans those who favoured cetewayothe usutusitting on the rightand those who favoured umbelazithe isigqosasitting on the left</s>  atthe head of the righthand section sat cetewayo his brethren and chiefmen</s>  at the head of the lefthand section sat umbelazi his brethren andhis chief men amongst whom i saw saduko take a place immediately behindthe prince so that he could whisper into his ear</s> to myself and my little band of eight hunters who by pandas expresspermission came armed with their guns as i did also for i wasdetermined that if the necessity arose we would sell our lives as dearlyas we could was appointed a place almost in front of the king andbetween the two factions</s>  when everyone was seated the trial beganpanda demanding to know who had caused the tumult of the previous night</s> i cannot set out what followed in all its details for it would be toolong also i have forgotten many of them</s>  i remember however thatcetewayos people said that umbelazis men were the aggressors and thatumbelazis people said that cetewayos men were the aggressors and thateach of their parties backed up these statements which were given atgreat length with loud shouts</s> how am i to know the truth</s>  exclaimed panda at last</s>  macumazahn youwere there step forward and tell it to me</s> so i stood out and told the king what i had seen namely that thecaptain who favoured cetewayo had begun the quarrel by striking thecaptain who favoured umbelazi but that in the end umbelazis man hadkilled cetewayos man after which the fighting commenced</s> then it would seem that the usutu are to blame said panda</s> upon what grounds do you say so my father</s>  asked cetewayo springingup</s>  upon the testimony of this white man who is well known to be thefriend of umbelazi and of his henchman saduko and who himself killedtwo of those who called me chief in the course of the fight</s> yes cetewayo i broke in because i thought it better that i shouldkill them than that they should kill me whom they attacked quiteunprovoked</s> at any rate you killed them little white man shouted cetewayo forwhich cause your blood is forfeit</s>  say did umbelazi give you leave toappear before the king accompanied by men armed with guns when we whoare his sons must come with sticks only</s>  if so let him protect you</s> that i will do if there is need</s>  exclaimed umbelazi</s> thank you prince i said but if there is need i will protect myselfas i did yesterday and cocking my doublebarrelled rifle i lookedfull at cetewayo</s> when you leave here then at least i will come even with youmacumazahn</s>  threatened cetewayo spitting through his teeth as was hisway when mad with passion</s> for he was beside himself and wished to vent his temper on someonealthough in truth he and i were always good friends</s> if so i shall stop where i am i answered coolly in the shadow ofthe king your father</s>  moreover are you so lost in folly cetewayothat you should wish to bring the english about your ears</s>  know that ifi am killed you will be asked to give account of my blood</s> aye interrupted panda and know that if anyone lays a finger onmacumazana who is my guest he shall die whether he be a common man ora prince and my son</s>  also cetewayo i fine you twenty head of cattleto be paid to macumazana because of the unprovoked attack which your menmade upon him when he rightly slew them</s> the fine shall be paid my father said cetewayo more quietly for hesaw that in threatening me he had pushed matters too far</s> then after some more talk panda gave judgment in the cause whichjudgment really amounted to nothing</s>  as it was impossible to decidewhich party was most to blame he fined both an equal number of cattleaccompanying the fine with a lecture on their illbehaviour which waslistened to indifferently</s> after this matter was disposed of the real business of the meetingbegan</s> rising to his feet cetewayo addressed panda</s> my father he said the land wanders and wanders in darkness and youalone can give light for its feet</s>  i and my brother umbelazi are atvariance and the quarrel is a great one namely as to which of us isto sit in your place when you are gone down when we call and youdo not answer</s>  some of the nation favour one of us and some favourthe other but you o king and you alone have the voice of judgment</s> still before you speak i and those who stand with me would bring thisto your mind</s>  my mother umqumbazi is your inkosikazi your headwifeand therefore according to our law i her eldest son should be yourheir</s>  moreover when you fled to the boers before the fall of him whosat in your place before you dingaan did not they the white amabunuask you which amongst your sons was your heir and did you not pointme out to the white men</s>  and thereon did not the amabunu clothe me in adress of honour because i was the king to be</s>  but now of late the motherof umbelazi has been whispering in your ear as have othersand helooked at saduko and some of umbelazis brethrenand your face hasgrown cold towards me so cold that many say that you will point outumbelazi to be king after you and stamp on my name</s>  if this is so myfather tell me at once that i may know what to do</s> having finished this speech which certainly did not lack force anddignity cetewayo sat down again awaiting the answer in sullen silence</s> but making none panda looked at umbelazi who on rising was greetedwith a great cheer for although cetewayo had the larger following inthe land especially among the distant chiefs the zulus individuallyloved umbelazi more perhaps because of his stature beauty and kindlydispositionphysical and moral qualities that naturally appeal to asavage nation</s> my father he said like my brother cetewayo i await your word</s> whatever you may have said to the amabunu in haste or fear i do notadmit that cetewayo was ever proclaimed your heir in the hearing of thezulu people</s>  i say that my right to the succession is as good as hisand that it lies with you and you alone to declare which of us shallput on the royal kaross in days that my heart prays may be distant</s> still to save bloodshed i am willing to divide the land with cetewayohere both panda and cetewayo shook their heads and the audience roarednay or if that does not please him i am willing to meet cetewayoman to man and spear to spear and fight till one of us be slain</s> a safe offer</s>  sneered cetewayo for is not my brother namedelephant and the strongest warrior among the zulus</s>  no i will notset the fortunes of those who cling to me on the chance of a singlestab or on the might of a mans muscles</s>  decide o father say whichof the two of us is to sit at the head of your kraal after you have goneover to the spirits and are but an ancestor to be worshipped</s> now panda looked much disturbed as was not wonderful since rushingout from the fence behind which they had been listening umqumbazicetewayos mother whispered into one of his ears while umbelazismother whispered into the other</s>  what advice each of them gave i do notknow although obviously it was not the same advice since the poor manrolled his eyes first at one and then at the other and finally put hishands over his ears that he might hear no more</s> choose choose o king</s>  shouted the audience</s>  who is to succeed youcetewayo or umbelazi</s> watching panda i saw that he fell into a kind of agony his fat sidesheaved and although the day was cold sweat ran from his brow</s> what would the white men do in such a case</s>  he said to me in a hoarselow voice whereon i answered looking at the ground and speaking sothat few could hear mei think o king that a white man would do nothing</s>  he would say thatothers might settle the matter after he was dead</s> would that i could say so too muttered panda but it is notpossible</s> then followed a long pause during which all were silent for every manthere felt that the hour was big with doom</s>  at length panda rose withdifficulty because of his unwieldy weight and uttered these fatefulwords that were none the less ominous because of the homely idiom inwhich they were couchedwhen two young bulls quarrel they must fight it out</s> instantly in one tremendous roar volleyed forth the royal salute ofbayte a signal of the acceptance of the kings wordthe word thatmeant civil war and the death of many thousands</s> then panda turned and so feebly that i thought he would fall walkedthrough the gateway behind him followed by the rival queens</s>  each ofthese ladies struggled to be first after him in the gate thinking thatit would be an omen of success for her son</s>  finally however to thedisappointment of the multitude they only succeeded in passing it sideby side</s> when they had gone the great audience began to break up the men ofeach party marching away together as though by common consent withoutoffering any insult or molestation to their adversaries</s>  i think thatthis peaceable attitude arose however from the knowledge that mattershad now passed from the stage of private quarrel into that of publicwar</s>  it was felt that their dispute awaited decision not with sticksoutside the nodwengu kraal but with spears upon some great battlefieldfor which they went to prepare</s> within two days except for those regiments which panda kept to guardhis person scarcely a soldier was to be seen in the neighbourhood ofnodwengu</s>  the princes also departed to muster their adherents cetewayoestablishing himself among the mandhlakazi that he commanded andumbelazi returning to the kraal of umbezi which happened to standalmost in the centre of that part of the nation which adhered to him</s> whether he took mameena with him there i am not certain</s>  i believehowever that fearing lest her welcome at her birthplace should bewarmer than she wished she settled herself at some retired and outlyingkraal in the neighbourhood and there awaited the crisis of her fortune</s> at any rate i saw nothing of her for she was careful to keep out of myway</s> with umbelazi and saduko however i did have an interview</s>  before theyleft nodwengu they called on me together apparently on the best ofterms and said in effect that they hoped for my support in the comingwar</s> i answered that however well i might like them personally a zulu civilwar was no affair of mine and that indeed for every reason includingthe supreme one of my own safety i had better get out of the way atonce</s> they argued with me for a long while making great offers and promisesof reward till at length when he saw that my determination could notbe shaken umbelazi saidcome saduko let us humble ourselves no more before this white man</s> after all he is right the business is none of his and why should weask him to risk his life in our quarrel knowing as we do that whitemen are not like us they think a great deal of their lives</s>  farewellmacumazahn</s>  if i conquer and grow great you will always be welcome inzululand whereas if i fail perhaps you will be best over the tugelariver</s> now i felt the hidden taunt in this speech very keenly</s>  still beingdetermined that for once i would be wise and not allow my naturalcuriosity and love of adventure to drag me into more risks and troublei repliedthe prince says that i am not brave and love my life and what he saysis true</s>  i fear fighting who by nature am a trader with the heart ofa trader not a warrior with the heart of a warrior like the greatindhlovuenesihlontiwords at which i saw the grave saduko smilefaintly</s>  so farewell to you prince and may good fortune attend you</s> of course to call the prince to his face by this nickname whichreferred to a defect in his person was something of an insult buti had been insulted and meant to give him a roland for his oliver</s> however he took it in good part</s> what is good fortune macumazahn</s>  umbelazi replied as he grasped myhand</s>  sometimes i think that to live and prosper is good fortune andsometimes i think that to die and sleep is good fortune for in sleepthere is neither hunger nor thirst of body or of spirit</s>  in sleep therecome no cares in sleep ambitions are at rest nor do those who look nomore upon the sun smart beneath the treacheries of false women or falsefriends</s>  should the battle turn against me macumazahn at least thatgood fortune will be mine for never will i live to be crushed beneathcetewayos heel</s> then he went</s>  saduko accompanied him for a little way but making someexcuse to the prince came back and said to memacumazahn my friend i dare say that we part for the last time andtherefore i make a request to you</s>  it is as to one who is dead to me</s> macumazahn i believe that umbelazi the thiefthese words broke fromhis lips with a hisshas given her many cattle and hidden her awayeither in the kloof of zikali the wise or near to it under his care</s> now if the war should go against umbelazi and i should be killed init i think evil will fall upon that womans head i who have grown surethat it was she who was the wizard and not masapo the boar</s>  also as oneconnected with umbelazi who has helped him in his plots she will bekilled if she is caught</s>  macumazahn hearken to me</s>  i will tell you thetruth</s>  my heart is still on fire for that woman</s>  she has bewitched meher eyes haunt my sleep and i hear her voice in the wind</s>  she is more tome than all the earth and all the sky and although she has wronged mei do not wish that harm should come to her</s>  macumazahn i pray you if idie do your best to befriend her even though it be only as a servantin your house for i think that she cares more for you than for anyonewho only ran away with himand he pointed in the direction thatumbelazi had takenbecause he is a prince who in her folly shebelieves will be a king</s>  at least take her to natal macumazahn whereif you wish to be free of her she can marry whom she will and will livesafe until night comes</s>  panda loves you much and whoever conquers inthe war will give you her life if you ask it of him</s> then this strange man drew the back of his hand across his eyes fromwhich i saw the tears were running and muttering if you would havegood fortune remember my prayer turned and left me before i couldanswer a single word</s> as for me i sat down upon an antheap and whistled a whole hymn tunethat my mother had taught me before i could think at all</s>  to be leftthe guardian of mameena</s>  talk of a damnosa hereditas a terrible andmischievous inheritancewhy this was the worst that ever i heard of</s> a servant in my house indeed knowing what i did about her</s>  why i hadsooner share the good fortune which umbelazi anticipated beneaththe sod</s>  however that was not in the question and without it thealternative of acting as her guardian was bad enough though i comfortedmyself with the reflection that the circumstances in which this wouldbecome necessary might never arise</s>  for alas</s>  i was sure that if theydid arise i should have to live up to them</s>  true i had made no promiseto saduko with my lips but i felt as i knew he felt that this promisehad passed from my heart to his</s> that thief umbelazi</s>  strange words to be uttered by a great vassal ofhis lord and both of them about to enter upon a desperate enterprise</s> a prince whom in her folly she believes will be a king</s>  stranger wordsstill</s>  then saduko did not believe that he would be a king</s>  and yet hewas about to share the fortunes of his fight for the throne he who saidthat his heart was still on fire for the woman whom umbelazi the thiefhad stolen</s>  well if i were umbelazi thought i to myself i wouldrather that saduko were not my chief councillor and general</s>  but thankheaven</s>  i was not umbelazi or saduko or any of them</s>  and thank heavenstill more i was going to begin my trek from zululand on the morrow</s> man proposes but god disposes</s>  i did not trek from zululand for many along day</s>  when i got back to my wagons it was to find that my oxen hadmysteriously disappeared from the veld on which they were accustomedto graze</s>  they were lost or perhaps they had felt the urgent need oftrekking from zululand back to a more peaceful country</s>  i sent all thehunters i had with me to look for them only scowl and i remainingat the wagons which in those disturbed times i did not like to leaveunguarded</s> four days went by a week went by and no sign of either hunters oroxen</s>  then at last a message which reached me in some roundaboutfashion to the effect that the hunters had found the oxen a long wayoff but on trying to return to nodwengu had been driven by some ofthe usututhat is by cetewayos partyacross the tugela into natalwhence they dared not attempt to return</s> for once in my life i went into a rage and cursed that nondescript kindof messenger sent by i know not whom in language that i think he willnot forget</s>  then realising the futility of swearing at a mere tool iwent up to the great house and demanded an audience with panda himself</s> presently the inceku or household servant to whom i gave my messagereturned saying that i was to be admitted at once and on entering theenclosure i found the king sitting at the head of the kraal quite aloneexcept for a man who was holding a large shield over him in order tokeep off the sun</s> he greeted me warmly and i told him my trouble about the oxen whereonhe sent away the shieldholder leaving us two together</s> watcherbynight he said why do you blame me for these events whenyou know that i am nobody in my own house</s>  i say that i am a dead manwhose sons fight for his inheritance</s>  i cannot tell you for certain whoit was that drove away your oxen</s>  still i am glad that they are gonesince i believe that if you had attempted to trek to natal just now youwould have been killed on the road by the usutu who believe you to be acouncillor of umbelazi</s> i understand o king i answered and i dare say that the accident ofthe loss of my oxen is fortunate for me</s>  but tell me now what am i todo</s>  i wish to follow the example of john dunn another white man in thecountry who was much mixed up with zulu politics and leave the land</s> will you give me more oxen to draw my wagons</s> i have none that are broken in macumazahn for as you know we zuluspossess few wagons and if i had i would not lend them to you who donot desire that your blood should be upon my head</s> you are hiding something from me o king i said bluntly</s>  what is itthat you want me to do</s>  stay here at nodwengu</s> no macumazahn</s>  when the trouble begins i want you to go with aregiment of my own that i shall send to the assistance of my sonumbelazi so that he may have the benefit of your wisdom</s>  o macumazanai will tell you the truth</s>  my heart loves umbelazi and i fear me thathe is overmatched by cetewayo</s>  if i could i would save his life but iknow not how to do so since i must not seem to take sides too openly</s> but i can send down a regiment as your escort if you choose to go toview the battle as my agent and make report to me</s>  say will you notgo</s> why should i go</s>  i answered seeing that whoever wins i may bekilled and that if cetewayo wins i shall certainly be killed and allfor no reward</s> nay macumazahn i will give orders that whoever conquers the man thatdares to lift a spear against you shall die</s>  in this matter at least ishall not be disobeyed</s>  oh</s>  i pray you do not desert me in my trouble</s> go down with the regiment that i shall send and breathe your wisdom intothe ear of my son umbelazi</s>  as for your reward i swear to you by thehead of the black one chaka that it shall be great</s>  i will see to itthat you do not leave zululand emptyhanded macumazahn</s> still i hesitated for i mistrusted me of this business</s> o watcherbynight exclaimed panda you will not desert me willyou</s>  i am afraid for the son of my heart umbelazi whom i love aboveall my children i am much afraid for umbelazi and he burst into tearsbefore me</s> it was foolish no doubt but the sight of the old king weeping for hisbestbeloved child whom he believed to be doomed moved me so much thati forgot my caution</s> if you wish it o panda i said i will go down to the battle withyour regiment and stand there by the side of the prince umbelazi</s> chapter xiii</s>  umbelazi the fallenso i stayed on at nodwengu who indeed had no choice in the matterand was very wretched and ill at ease</s>  the place was almost desertedexcept for a couple of regiments which were quartered there thesangqu and the amawombe</s>  this latter was the royal regiment a kindof household guards to which the kings chaka dingaan and panda allbelonged in turn</s>  most of the headmen had taken one side or the otherand were away raising forces to fight for cetewayo or umbelazi and eventhe greater part of the women and children had gone to hide themselvesin the bush or among the mountains since none knew what would happenor if the conquering army would not fall upon and destroy them</s> a few councillors however remained with panda among whom was oldmaputa the general who had once brought me the message of the pills</s> several times he visited me at night and told me the rumours that wereflying about</s>  from these i gathered that some skirmishes had taken placeand the battle could not be long delayed also that umbelazi had chosenhis fighting ground a plain near the banks of the tugela</s> why has he done this i asked seeing that then he will have abroad river behind him and if he is defeated water can kill as well asspears</s> i know not for certain answered maputa but it is said because of adream that saduko his general has dreamed thrice which dream declaresthat there and there alone umbelazi will find honour</s>  at any rate hehas chosen this place and i am told that all the women and children ofhis army by thousands are hidden in the bush along the banks of theriver so that they may fly into natal if there is need</s> have they wings i asked wherewith to fly over the tugela inwrath as it well may be after the rains</s>  oh surely his spirit hasturned from umbelazi</s> aye macumazahn he answered i too think that ufulatewe idhlozithat is his own spirit has turned its back on him</s>  also i think thatsaduko is no good councillor</s>  indeed were i the prince added the oldfellow shrewdly i would not keep him whose wife i had stolen as thewhisperer in my ear</s> nor i maputa i answered as i bade him goodbye</s> two days later early in the morning maputa came to me again and saidthat panda wished to see me</s>  i went to the head of the kraal where ifound the king seated and before him the captains of the royal amawomberegiment</s> watcherbynight he said i have news that the great battle betweenmy sons will take place within a few days</s>  therefore i am sending downthis my own royal regiment under the command of maputa the skilled inwar to spy out the battle and i pray that you will go with it thatyou may give to the general maputa and to the captains the help ofyour wisdom</s>  now these are my orders to you maputa and to you ocaptainsthat you take no part in the fight unless you should see thatthe elephant my son umbelazi is fallen into a pit and that then youshall drag him out if you can and save him alive</s>  now repeat my words tome</s> so they repeated the words speaking with one voice</s> your answer o macumazana he said when they had spoken</s> o king i have told you that i will gothough i do not like warand iwill keep my promise i replied</s> then make ready macumazahn and be back here within an hour for theregiment marches ere noon</s> so i went up to my wagons and handed them over to the care of some menwhom panda had sent to take charge of them</s>  also scowl and i saddled ourhorses for this faithful fellow insisted upon accompanying me althoughi advised him to stay behind and got out our rifles and as muchammunition as we could possibly need and with them a few othernecessaries</s>  these things done we rode back to the gatheringplacetaking farewell of the wagons with a sad heart since i for one neverexpected to see them again</s>
as we went i saw that the regiment of the amawombe picked men every oneof them all fifty years of age or over nearly four thousand strongwas marshalled on the dancingground where they stood companyby company</s>  a magnificent sight they were with their whitefightingshields their gleaming spears their otterskin caps theirkilts and armlets of white bulls tails and the snowy egret plumeswhich they wore upon their brows</s>  we rode to the head of them where isaw maputa and as i came they greeted me with a cheer of welcome forin those days a white man was a power in the land</s>  moreover as i havesaid the zulus knew and liked me well</s>  also the fact that i was towatch or perchance to fight with them put a good heart into theamawombe</s> there we stood until the lads several hundreds of them who borethe mats and cooking vessels and drove the cattle that were to beour commissariat had wended away in a long line</s>  then suddenly pandaappeared out of his hut accompanied by a few servants and seemedto utter some kind of prayer as he did so throwing dust or powderedmedicine towards us though what this ceremony meant i did notunderstand</s> when he had finished maputa raised a spear whereon the whole regimentin perfect time shouted out the royal salute bayte with asound like that of thunder</s>  thrice they repeated this tremendous andimpressive salute and then were silent</s>  again maputa raised his spearand all the four thousand voices broke out into the ingoma or nationalchant to which deep aweinspiring music we began our march</s>  as i donot think it has ever been written down i will quote the words</s>  theyran thus  ba ya mzonda  ba ya mloyisa  izizwe zonke  ba zond inkoosi</s>   literally translated this famous chant now i think  published for the

exact translation into english verse is almostimpossibleat any rate to me  loud on their lips is lying  rebels their king defying</s>   there shall be dead and dying  red are their eyes with hate  lo</s>  where our impis wait  vengeance insatiate</s> it was early on the morning of the 2nd of december a cold miserablemorning that came with wind and driving mist that i found myself withthe amawombe at the place known as endondakusuka a plain with somekopjes in it that lies within six miles of the natal border from whichit is separated by the tugela river</s> as the orders of the amawombe were to keep out of the fray if that werepossible we had taken up a position about a mile to the right of whatproved to be the actual battlefield choosing as our camping grounda rising knoll that looked like a huge tumulus and was fronted at adistance of about five hundred yards by another smaller knoll</s>  behind usstretched bushland or rather broken land where mimosa thorns grew inscattered groups sloping down to the banks of the tugela about fourmiles away</s> shortly after dawn i was roused from the place where i slept wrappedup in some blankets under a mimosa treefor of course we had notentsby a messenger who said that the prince umbelazi and the whiteman john dunn wished to see me</s>  i rose and tidied myself as best icould since if i can avoid it i never like to appear before nativesin a dishevelled condition</s>  i remember that i had just finished brushingmy hair when umbelazi arrived</s> i can see him now looking a veritable giant in that morning mist</s> indeed there was something quite unearthly about his appearance ashe arose out of those rolling vapours such light as there was beingconcentrated upon the blade of his big spear which was well known asthe broadest carried by any warrior in zululand and a copper torque hewore about his throat</s> there he stood rolling his eyes and hugging his kaross around himbecause of the cold and something in his anxious indeterminateexpression told me at once that he knew himself to be a man in terribledanger</s>  just behind him dark and brooding his arms folded onhis breast his eyes fixed upon the ground looking to my movedimagination like an evil genius stood the stately and graceful saduko</s> on his left was a young and sturdy white man carrying a rifle andsmoking a pipe whom i guessed to be john dunn a gentleman whom as itchanced i had never met while behind were a force of natal governmentzulus clad in some kind of uniform and armed with guns and with them anumber of natives also from natalkraal kafirs who carried stabbingassegais</s>  one of these led john dunns horse</s> of those government men there may have been thirty or forty and of thekraal kafirs anything between two and three hundred</s> i shook umbelazis hand and gave him goodday</s> that is an ill day upon which no sun shines o macumazana heansweredwords that struck me as ominous</s>  then he introduced me to johndunn who seemed glad to meet another white man</s>  next not knowing whatto say i asked the exact object of their visit whereon dunn began totalk</s>  he said that he had been sent over on the previous afternoon bycaptain walmsley who was an officer of the natal government stationedacross the border to try to make peace between the zulu factions butthat when he spoke of peace one of umbelazis brothersi think it wasmantantashiyahad mocked at him saying that they were quite strongenough to cope with the usututhat was cetewayos party</s>  also headded that when he suggested that the thousands of women and childrenand the cattle should be got across the tugela drift during the previousnight into safety in natal mantantashiya would not listen and umbelazibeing absent seeking the aid of the natal government he could donothing</s> quem deus vult perdere prius dementat whom god wishes to destroy hefirst makes mad quoted i to myself beneath my breath</s>  this was one ofthe latin

were talking in english</s>  cant you getumbelazi to do it now</s>  i meant to send the women and children acrossthe river</s> i fear it is too late mr</s>  quatermain he answered</s>  the usutu arein sight</s>  look for yourself</s>  and he handed me a telescope which he hadwith him</s> i climbed on to some rocks and scanned the plain in front of us fromwhich just then a puff of wind rolled away the mist</s>  it was black withadvancing men</s>  as yet they were a considerable distance awayquite twomiles i should thinkand coming on very slowly in a great halfmoonwith thin horns and a deep breast but a ray from the sun glittered upontheir countless spears</s>  it seemed to me that there must be quite twentyor thirty thousand of them in this breast which was in three divisionscommanded as i learned afterwards by cetewayo uzimela and by a youngboer named groening</s> there they are right enough i said climbing down from my rocks</s> what are you going to do mr</s>  dunn</s> obey orders and try to make peace if i can find anyone to make peacewith and if i cantwell fight i suppose</s>  and you mr</s>  quatermain</s> oh obey orders and stop here i suppose</s>  unless i added

your own business best but i hopeyou will come out of it safely that is all</s> same to you i replied</s> then john dunn turned and in my hearing asked umbelazi what he knew ofthe movements of the usutu and of their plan of battle</s> the prince replied with a shrug of his shouldersnothing at present son of mr</s>  dunn but doubtless before the sun ishigh i shall know much</s> as he spoke a sudden gust of wind struck us and tore the noddingostrich plume from its fastening on umbelazis headring</s>  whilst amurmur of dismay rose from all who saw what they considered this veryillomened accident away it floated into the air to fall gently to theground at the feet of saduko</s>  he stooped picked it up and reset itin its place saying as he did so with that ready wit for which somekafirs are remarkableso may i live o prince to set the crown upon the head of pandasfavoured son</s> this apt speech served to dispel the general gloom caused by theincident for those who heard it cheered while umbelazi thanked hiscaptain with a nod and a smile</s>  only i noted that saduko did not mentionthe name of pandas favoured son upon whose head he hoped to live toset the crown</s>  now panda had many sons and that day would show whichof them was favoured</s> a minute or two later john dunn and his following departed as he saidto try to make peace with the advancing usutu</s>  umbelazi saduko andtheir escort departed also towards the main body of the host of theisigqosa which was massed to our left sitting on their spears asthe natives say and awaiting the attack</s>  as for me i remained alonewith the amawombe drinking some coffee that scowl had brewed for meand forcing myself to swallow food</s> i can say honestly that i do not ever remember partaking of a moreunhappy meal</s>  not only did i believe that i was looking on the last suni should ever seethough by the way there was uncommonly little ofthat orb visiblebut what made the matter worse was that

and i was evenmean enough to wish that i had broken my word to panda and gone off withjohn dunn when he invited me although now i thank goodness that i didnot yield to that temptation and thereby sacrifice my selfrespect</s> soon however things grew so exciting that i forgot these and othermelancholy reflections in watching the development of events from thesummit of our tumuluslike knoll whence i had a magnificent view of thewhole battle</s>  here after seeing that his regiment made a full mealas a good general should old maputa joined me whom i asked whether hethought there would be any fighting for him that day</s> i think so i think so he answered cheerfully</s>  it seems to me thatthe usutu greatly outnumber umbelazi and the isigqosa and of courseas you know pandas orders are that if he is in danger we must helphim</s>  oh keep a good heart macumazahn for i believe i can promise youthat you will see our spears grow red today</s>  you will not go hungryfrom this battle to tell the white people that the amawombe are cowardswhom you could not flog into the fight</s>  no no macumazahn my spiritlooks towards me this morning and i who am old and who thought thati should die at length like a cow shall see one more great fightmytwentieth macumazahn for i fought with this same amawombe in all theblack ones big battles and for panda against dingaan also</s> perhaps it will be your last i suggested</s> i dare say macumazahn but what does that matter if only i and theroyal regiment can make an end that shall be spoken of</s>  oh cheer upcheer up macumazahn your spirit too looks towards you as i promisethat we all will do when the shields meet for know macumazahn that wepoor black soldiers expect that you will show us how to fight this dayand if need be how to fall hidden in a heap of the foe</s> oh</s>  i replied so this is what you zulus mean by the giving ofcounsel is it</s> you infernal bloodthirsty old scoundrel i added inenglish</s> but i think maputa never heard me</s>  at any rate he only seized my armand pointed in front a little to the left where the horn of the greatusutu army was coming up fast a long thin line alive with twinklingspears their moving arms and legs causing them to look like spiders ofwhich the bodies were formed by the great war shields</s> see their plan</s>  he said</s>  they would close on umbelazi and gore himwith their horns and then charge with their head</s>  the horn will passbetween us and the right flank of the isigqosa</s>  oh</s>  awake awakeelephant</s>  are you asleep with mameena in a hut</s>  unloose your spearschild of the king and at them as they mount the slope</s>  behold</s>  he wenton it is the son of dunn that begins the battle</s>  did i not tell youthat we must look to the white men to show us the way</s>  peep through yourtube macumazahn and tell me what passes</s> so i peeped and the telescope which john dunn had kindly left withme being good though small saw everything clearly enough</s>  he rodeup almost to the point of the left horn of the usutu waving a whitehandkerchief and followed by his small force of police and natal kafirs</s> then from somewhere among the usutu rose a puff of smoke</s>  dunn had beenfired at</s> he dropped the handkerchief and leapt to the ground</s>  now he and hispolice were firing rapidly in reply and men fell fast among the usutu</s> they raised their war shout and came on though slowly for they fearedthe bullets</s>  step by step john dunn and his people were thrust backfighting gallantly against overwhelming odds</s>  they were level with usnot a quarter of a mile to our left</s>  they were pushed past us</s>  theyvanished among the bush behind us and a long while passed before ever iheard what became of them for we met no more that day</s> now the horns having done their work and wrapped themselves roundumbelazis army as the nippers of a wasp close about a fly why didnot umbelazi cut off those horns i wondered the usutu bull beganhis charge</s>  twenty or thirty thousand strong regiment after regimentcetewayos men rushed up the slope and there near the crest ofit were met by umbelazis regiments springing forward to repel theonslaught and shouting their battlecry of laba</s>  laba</s>  laba</s>  laba</s> the noise of their meeting shields came to our ears like that of theroll of thunder and the sheen of their stabbingspears shone as shinesthe broad summer lightning</s>  they hung and wavered on the slope thenfrom the amawombe ranks rose a roar ofumbelazi wins</s> watching intently we saw the usutu giving back</s>  down the slope theywent leaving the ground in front of them covered with black spots whichwe knew to be dead or wounded men</s> why does not the elephant charge home</s>  said maputa in a perplexedvoice</s>  the usutu bull is on his back</s>  why does he not trample him</s> because he is afraid i suppose i answered and went on watching</s> there was plenty to see as it happened</s>  finding that they were notpursued cetewayos impi reformed swiftly at the bottom of the slopein preparation for another charge</s>  among that of umbelazi above themrapid movements took place of which i could not guess the meaningwhich movements were accompanied by much noise of angry shouting</s>  thensuddenly from the midst of the isigqosa army emerged a great body ofmen thousands strong which ran swiftly but in open order down theslope towards the usutu holding their spears reversed</s>  at first ithought that they were charging independently till i saw the usuturanks open to receive them with a shout of welcome</s> treachery</s>  i said</s>  who is it</s> saduko with the amakoba and amangwane soldiers and others</s>  i know themby their headdresses answered maputa in a cold voice</s> do you mean that saduko has gone over to cetewayo with all hisfollowing</s>  i asked excitedly</s> what else macumazahn</s>  saduko is a traitor umbelazi is finished andhe passed his hand swiftly across his moutha gesture that has only onemeaning among the zulus</s> as for me i sat down upon a stone and groaned for now i understoodeverything</s> presently the usutu raised fierce triumphant shouts and once againtheir impi swelled with sadukos power began to advance up the slope</s> umbelazi and those of the isigqosa party who clung to himnow ishould judge not more than eight thousand mennever stayed to wait theonslaught</s>  they broke</s>  they fled in a hideous rout crashing throughthe thin left horn of the usutu by mere weight of numbers andpassing behind us obliquely on their road to the banks of the tugela</s>  amessenger rushed up to us panting</s> these are the words of umbelazi he gasped</s>  o watcherbynight and omaputa indhlovuenesihlonti prays that you will hold back the usutuas the king bade you do in case of need and so give to him and thosewho cling to him time to escape with the women and children intonatal</s>  his general saduko has betrayed him and gone over with threeregiments to cetewayo and therefore we can no longer stand against thethousands of the usutu</s> go tell the prince that macumazahn maputa and the amawombe regimentwill do their best answered maputa calmly</s>  still this is our adviceto him that he should cross the tugela swiftly with the women and thechildren seeing that we are few and cetewayo is many</s> the messenger leapt away but as i heard afterwards he never foundumbelazi since the poor man was killed within five hundred yards ofwhere we stood</s> then maputa gave an order and the amawombe formed themselves into atriple line thirteen hundred men in the first line thirteen hundredmen in the second line and about a thousand in the third behind whomwere the carrier boys three or four hundred of them</s>  the place assignedto me was in the exact centre of the second line where being mountedon a horse it was thought as i gathered that i should serve as aconvenient rallyingpoint</s> in this formation we advanced a few hundred yards to our left evidentlywith the object of interposing ourselves between the routed impi and thepursuing usutu or if the latter should elect to go round us with thatof threatening their flank</s>  cetewayos generals did not leave us long indoubt as to what they would do</s>  the main body of their army bore awayto the right in pursuit of the flying foe but three regiments eachof about two thousand five hundred spears halted</s>  five minutes passedperhaps while they marshalled with a distance of some six hundred yardsbetween them</s>  each regiment was in a triple line like our own</s> to me that seemed a very long five minutes but reflecting that it wasprobably my last on earth i tried to make the best of it in a fashionthat can be guessed</s>  strange to say however i found it impossible tokeep my mind fixed upon those matters with which it ought to have beenfilled</s>  my eyes and thoughts would roam</s>  i looked at the ranks of theveteran amawombe and noted that they were still and solemn as men aboutto die should be although they showed no sign of fear</s>  indeed isaw some of those near me passing their snuffboxes to each other</s>  twogreyhaired men also who evidently were old friends shook hands aspeople do who are parting before a journey while two others discussedin a low voice the possibility of our wiping out most of the usutubefore we were wiped out ourselves</s> it depends said one of them whether they attack us regiment byregiment or all together as they will do if they are wise</s> then an officer bade them be silent and conversation ceased</s>  maputapassed through the ranks giving orders to the captains</s>  from a distancehis withered old body with a fighting shield held in front of itlooked like that of a huge black ant carrying something in its mouth</s>  hecame to where scowl and i sat upon our horses</s> ah</s>  i see that you are ready macumazahn he said in a cheerful voice</s> i told you that you should not go away hungry did i not</s> maputa i said in remonstrance what is the use of this</s>  umbelazi isdefeated you are not of his impi why send all theseand i waved myhanddown into the darkness</s>  why not go to the river and try to savethe women and children</s> because we shall take many of those down into the darkness with usmacumazahn and he pointed to the dense masses of the usutu</s>  yet headded with a touch of compunction this is not your quarrel</s>  you andyour servant have horses</s>  slip out if you will and gallop hard to thelower drift</s>  you may get away with your lives</s> then my white mans pride came to my aid</s> nay i answered i will not run while others stay to fight</s> i never thought you would macumazahn who i am sure do not wish toearn a new and ugly name</s>  well neither will the amawombe run to becomea mock among their people</s>  the kings orders were that we should try tohelp umbelazi if the battle went against him</s>  we obey the kings ordersby dying where we stand</s>  macumazahn do you think that you could hitthat big fellow who is shouting insults at us there</s>  if so i should beobliged to you as i dislike him very much and he showed me a captainwho was swaggering about in front of the lines of the first of the usuturegiments about six hundred yards away</s> i will try i answered but its a long shot</s>  dismounting i climbeda pile of stones and resting my rifle on the topmost of them tooka very full sight aimed held my breath and pressed the trigger</s>  asecond afterwards the shouter of insults threw his arms wide lettingfall his spear and pitched forward on to his face</s> a roar of delight rose from the watching amawombe while old maputaclapped his thin brown hands and grinned from ear to ear</s> thank you macumazahn</s>  a very good omen</s>  now i am sure that whateverthose isigqosa dogs of umbelazis may do we kings men shall make anexcellent end which is all that we can hope</s>  oh what a beautiful shot</s> it will be something to think of when i am an idhlozi a spiritsnakecrawling about my own kraal</s>  farewell macumazahn and he took myhand and pressed it</s>  the time has come</s>  i go to lead the charge</s>  theamawombe have orders to defend you to the last for i wish you to seethe finish of this fight</s>  farewell</s> then off he hurried followed by his orderlies and staffofficers</s> i never saw him again alive though i think that once in after years idid meet his idhlozi in his kraal under strange circumstances</s>  but thathas nothing to do with this history</s> as for me having reloaded i mounted my horse again being afraid lestif i went on shooting i should miss and spoil my reputation</s>  besideswhat was the use of killing more men unless i was obliged</s>  there wereplenty ready to do that</s> another minute and the regiment in front of us began to move while theother two behind it ostentatiously sat themselves down in their ranksto show that they did not mean to spoil sport</s>  the fight was to beginwith a duel between about six thousand men</s> good</s>  muttered the warrior who was nearest me</s>  they are in our bag</s> aye answered another those little boys used as a term ofcontempt are going to learn their last lesson</s> for a few seconds there was silence while the long ranks leant forwardbetween the hedges of lean and cruel spears</s>  a whisper went down theline it sounded like the noise of wind among trees and was the signalto prepare</s>  next a faroff voice shouted some word which was repeatedagain and again by other voices before and behind me</s>  i became awarethat we were moving quite slowly at first then more quickly</s>  beinglifted above the ranks upon my horse i could see the whole advanceand the general aspect of it was that of a triple black wave each wavecrowned with foamthe white plumes and shields of the amawombe werethe foamand alive with sparkles of lighttheir broad spears were thelight</s> we were charging nowand oh</s>  the awful and glorious excitement of thatcharge</s>  oh the rush of the bending plumes and the dull thudding ofeight thousand feet</s>  the usutu came up the slope to meet us</s>  in silencewe went and in silence they came</s>  we drew near to each other</s>  now wecould see their faces peering over the tops of their mottled shieldsand now we could see their fierce and rolling eyes</s> then a roara rolling roar such as at that time i had never heardthe thunder of the roar of the meeting shieldsand a flasha swiftsimultaneous flash the flash of the lightning of the stabbing spears</s> up went the cry ofkill amawombe kill</s>  answered by another cry oftoss usutu toss</s> after that what happened</s>  heaven knows aloneor at least i do not</s> but in later years mr</s>  osborn afterwards the resident magistrate atnewcastle in natal who being young and foolish in those days hadswum his horse over the tugela and hidden in a little kopje quite nearto us in order to see the battle told me that it looked as thoughsome huge breakerthat breaker being the splendid amawomberolling intowards the shore with the weight of the ocean behind it had suddenlystruck a ridge of rock and rearing itself up submerged and hidden it</s> at least within three minutes that usutu regiment was no more</s>  wehad killed them every one and from all along our lines rose a fiercehissing sound of sgee sgee zhi in the zulu uttered as thespears went home in the bodies of the conquered</s> that regiment had gone taking nearly a third of our number with it forin such a battle as this the wounded were as good as dead</s>
 before it was well over the second usutu regiment sprang up andcharged</s>  with a yell of victory we rushed down the slope towards them</s> again there was the roar of the meeting shields but this time the fightwas more prolonged and being in the front rank now i had my share ofit</s>  i remember shooting two usutu who stabbed at me after which my gunwas wrenched from my hand</s>  i remember the mle swinging backwards andforwards the groans of the wounded the shouts of victory and despairand then scowls voice sayingwe have beat them baas but here come the others</s> the third regiment was on our shattered lines</s>  we closed up we foughtlike devils even the bearer boys rushed into the fray</s>  from all sidesthey poured down upon us for we had made a ring every minute men diedby hundreds and though their numbers grew few not one of the amawombeyielded</s>  i was fighting with a spear now though how it came into myhand i cannot remember for certain</s>  i think however i wrenched it froma man who rushed at me and was stabbed before he could strike</s>  i killeda captain with this spear for as he fell i recognised his face</s>  it wasthat of one of cetewayos companions to whom i had sold some cloth atnodwengu</s>  the fallen were piled up quite thick around mewe were usingthem as a breastwork friend and foe together</s>  i saw scowls horse rearinto the air and fall</s>  he slipped over its tail and next instant wasfighting at my side also with a spear muttering dutch and englishoaths as he struck</s> beetje varm</s>  a little hot beetje varm baas</s>  i heard him say</s>  thenmy horse screamed aloud and something hit me hard upon the headisuppose it was a thrown kerryafter which i remember nothing for awhile except a sensation of passing through the air</s> i came to myself again and found that i was still on the horse whichwas ambling forward across the veld at a rate of about eight miles anhour and that scowl was clinging to my stirrup leather and running atmy side</s>  he was covered with blood so was the horse and so was i</s>  itmay have been our own blood for all three were more or less wounded orit may have been that of others i am sure i do not know but we werea terrible sight</s>  i pulled upon the reins and the horse stopped amongsome thorns</s>  scowl felt in the saddlebags and found a large flask ofhollands gin and waterhalf gin and half waterwhich he had placedthere before the battle</s>  he uncorked and gave it to me</s>  i took a longpull at the stuff that tasted like veritable nectar then handed it tohim who did likewise</s>  new life seemed to flow into my veins</s>  whateverteetotallers may say alcohol is good at such a moment</s> where are the amawombe</s>  i asked</s> all dead by now i think baas as we should be had not your horsebolted</s>  wow</s>  but they made a great fightone that will be told of</s>  theyhave carried those three regiments away upon their spears</s> thats good i said</s>  but where are we going</s> to natal i hope baas</s>  i have had enough of the zulus for the present</s> the tugela is not far away and we will swim it</s>  come on before ourhurts grow stiff</s> so we went on till presently we reached the crest of a rise of groundoverlooking the river and there saw and heard dreadful things forbeneath us those devilish usutu were massacring the fugitives and thecampfollowers</s>  these were being driven by the hundred to the edge ofthe water there to perish on the banks or in the stream which wasblack with drowned or drowning forms</s> and oh</s>  the sounds</s>  well these i will not attempt to describe</s> keep up stream i said shortly and we struggled across a kind ofdonga where only a few wounded men were hidden into a somewhat denserpatch of bush that had scarcely been entered by the flying isigqosaperhaps because here the banks of the river were very steep anddifficult also between them its waters ran swiftly for this was abovethe drift</s> for a while we went on in safety then suddenly i heard a noise</s>  a greatman plunged past me breaking through the bush like a buffalo and cameto a halt upon a rock which overhung the tugela for the floods hadeaten away the soil beneath</s> umbelazi</s>  said scowl and as he spoke we saw another man following asa wild dog follows a buck</s> saduko</s>  said scowl</s> i rode on</s>  i could not help riding on although i knew it would be saferto keep away</s>  i reached the edge of that big rock</s>  saduko and umbelaziwere fighting there</s> in ordinary circumstances strong and active as he was saduko wouldhave had no chance against the most powerful zulu living</s>  but the princewas utterly exhausted his sides were going like a blacksmiths bellowsor those of a fat eland bull that has been galloped to a standstill</s> moreover he seemed to me to be distraught with grief and lastly hehad no shield left nothing but an assegai</s> a stab from sadukos spear which he partially parried wounded himslightly on the head and cut loose the fillet of his ostrich plumethat same plume which i had seen blown off in the morning so thatit fell to the ground</s>  another stab pierced his right arm makingit helpless</s>  he snatched the assegai with his left hand striving tocontinue the fight and just at that moment we came up</s> what are you doing saduko</s>  i cried</s>  does a dog bite his own master</s> he turned and stared at me both of them stared at me</s> aye macumazahn he answered in an icy voice sometimes when it isstarving and that fullfed master has snatched away its bone</s>  nay standaside macumazahn for although i was quite unarmed i had steppedbetween them lest you should share the fate of this womanthief</s> not i saduko i cried for this sight made me mad unless you murderme</s> then umbelazi spoke in a hollow voice sobbing out his wordsi thank you white man yet do as this snake bids youthis snake thathas lived in my kraal and fed out of my cup</s>  let him have his fill ofvengeance because of the woman who bewitched meyes because of thesorceress who has brought me and thousands to the dust</s>  have you heardmacumazahn of the great deed of this son of matiwane</s>  have you heardthat all the while he was a traitor in the pay of cetewayo and that hewent over with the regiments of his command to the usutu just when thebattle hung upon

though i put up the best fight that i could inmy injured state got his hands about my throat and began to chokeme</s>  scowl ran to help me but his woundfor he was hurtor his utterexhaustion took

now dog why do i notkill you as would have been easy but now</s>  i will tell you</s>  because iwill not mix the blood of a traitor with my own</s>  see</s>  he set the haftof his broad spear upon the

he uttered thebattlecry of laba</s>  laba</s>  and let his weight fall upon the point ofthe spear</s> it pierced him through and through</s>  he fell on to his hands and knees</s> he looked up at usoh the piteousness of that look</s> and then rolledsideways from the edge of the rock</s> a heavy splash and that was the end of umbelazi the fallenumbelaziabout whom mameena had cast her net</s> a sad story in truth</s>  although it happened so many years ago i weep as iwrite iti weep as umbelazi wept</s> chapter xiv</s>  umbezi and the blood royalafter this i think that some of the usutu came up

they carried away upona shield</s> when i came to i found myself in a little cave or rather beneath someoverhanging rocks at the side of a kopje and with me scowl who hadrecovered from his fit but seemed in a very bewildered condition</s> indeed neither then nor afterwards did he remember anything of thedeath of umbelazi nor did i ever tell him that tale</s>  like many othershe thought that the prince had been drowned in trying to swim thetugela</s> are they going to kill us</s>  i asked of him since from the triumphantshouting without i knew that we must be in the midst of the victorioususutu</s> i dont know baas he answered</s>  i hope not after we have gonethrough so much it would be a pity</s>  better to have died at the beginningof the battle</s> i nodded my head in assent and just at that moment a zulu who had veryevidently been fighting entered the place carrying a dish of toastedlumps of beef and a gourd of water</s> cetewayo sends you these macumazahn he said and is sorry thatthere is no milk or beer</s>  when you have eaten a guard waits without toescort you to him</s>  and he went</s> well i said to scowl if they were going to kill us they wouldscarcely take the trouble to feed us first</s>  so let us keep up our heartsand eat</s> who knows</s>  answered poor scowl as he crammed a lump of beef intohis big mouth</s>  still it is better to die on a full than on an emptystomach</s> so we ate and drank and as we were suffering more from exhaustion thanfrom our hurts which were not really serious our strength came backto us</s>  as we finished the last lump of meat which although it had beenonly half cooked upon the point of an assegai tasted very good thezulu put his head into the mouth of the shelter and asked if we wereready</s>  i nodded and supporting each other scowl and i limped from theplace</s>  outside were about fifty soldiers who greeted us with a shoutthat although it was mixed with laughter at our pitiable appearancestruck me as not altogether unfriendly</s>  amongst these men was my horsewhich stood with its head hanging down looking very depressed</s>  i washelped on to its back and scowl clinging to the stirrup leather wewere led a distance of about a quarter of a mile to cetewayo</s> we found him seated in the full blaze of the evening sun on theeastern slope of one of the landwaves of the veld with the openplain in front of him</s>  it was a strange and savage scene</s>
 izimbongi alsothat is professionalpraiserswere running up and down before him dressed in all sorts offinery telling his deeds calling him eaterupoftheearth andyelling out the names of those great ones who had been killed in thebattle</s> meanwhile parties of bearers were coming up continually carrying deadmen of distinction upon shields and laying them out in rows as gameis laid out at the end of a days shooting in england</s>  it seems thatcetewayo had taken a fancy to see them and being too tired to walkover the field of battle ordered that this should be done</s>  among theseby the way i saw the body of my old friend maputa the general of theamawombe and noted that it was literally riddled with spear thrustsevery one of them in front also that his quaint face still wore asmile</s> at the head of these lines of corpses were laid six dead all men oflarge size in whom i recognised the brothers of umbelazi who hadfought on his side and the halfbrothers of cetewayo</s>  among them werethose three princes upon whom the dust had fallen when zikali theprophet smelt out masapo the husband of mameena</s> dismounting from my horse with the help of scowl i limped through andover the corpses of these fallen royalties cut in the zulu fashion tofree their spirits which otherwise as they believed would haunt theslayers and stood in front of cetewayo</s> siyakubona macumazahn he said

quarrelled</s>  still i am pleased that they did sowell and i have given orders that every one of them who remains aliveis to be spared that they may be officers of a new amawombe which ishall

had itnot been for the loyaltythis word was spoken with just a tinge ofsarcasmof saduko yonder you would have won the day for umbelazi</s> well now that this quarrel is finished if you will stay with me iwill make you general of a whole division of the kings army sincehenceforth i shall have a voice in affairs</s> you are mistaken o son of panda i answered the splendour of theamawombes great stand

fight as a soldier in his ranks</s> oh yes we know that we know all that macumazahn and maputa was aclever monkey in his way but we know also that you taught him how tojump</s>  well he is dead and nearly all the amawombe are dead and ofmy three regiments but a handful is left the vultures have the restof them</s>  that is all finished and forgotten macumazahn though by goodfortune the spears went wide of you who doubtless are a magician sinceotherwise you and your servant and your horse would not have escapedwith a few scratches when everyone else was killed</s>  but you did escapeas you have done before in zululand and now you see here lie certainmen who were born of my father</s>  yet one is missinghe against whom ifought aye and he whom although we fought i loved the best of allof them</s>  now it has been whispered in my ear that you alone know whatbecame of him and macumazahn i would learn whether he lives or isdead also if he is dead by whose hand he died who would reward thathand</s> now i looked round me wondering whether i should tell the truth orhold my tongue and as i looked my eyes met those of saduko who coldand unconcerned was seated among the captains but at a little distancefrom any of thema man apart and i remembered that he and i alone knewthe truth of the end of umbelazi</s> why i do not know but it came into my mind that i would keep thesecret</s>  why should i tell the triumphant cetewayo that umbelazi had beendriven to die by his own hand why should i lay bare sadukos victoryand shame</s>  all these matters had passed into the court of a differenttribunal</s>  who was i that i should reveal them or judge the actors ofthis terrible drama</s> o cetewayo i said as it chanced i saw the end of umbelazi</s>  no enemykilled him</s>  he died

died of a broken heart</s> so in truth he did for before his spear pierced it his heart wasbroken</s> now seeing that cetewayo was in one of his soft moods and that heseemed to look upon me kindly though i had fought against him ireflected that this would be a good opportunity to ask his leave todepart</s>  to tell the truth my nerves were quite shattered with all i hadgone through and i longed to be away from the sights and sounds of thatterrible battlefield on and about which so many thousand people hadperished this fateful day as i had seldom longed for anything before</s> but while i was making up my mind as to the best way to approach himsomething happened which caused me to lose my chance</s> hearing a noise behind me i looked round to see a stout man arrayedin a very fine war dress

father of mameena whom the dead dogumbelazi took away from your master saduko the cunning</s> this o mighty one this o shaker of the earth that well am i namedeaterupofelephants who have eaten up indhlovuenesihlontitheelephant himself</s> now saduko seemed to awake from his brooding and started from his placebut cetewayo sharply bade him be silent whereon umbezi the foolnoting nothing continued his tale</s> o prince i met umbelazi in the battle and when he saw me he fled fromme yes his heart grew soft as water at the sight of me the warriorwhom he had wronged whose daughter he had stolen</s> i hear you said cetewayo</s>  umbelazis heart turned to water at thesight of you because he had wronged youyou who until this morningwhen you deserted him with saduko were one of his jackals</s>  well andwhat happened then</s> he fled o lion with the black mane he fled like the wind and i iflew after him likea stronger wind</s>  far into the bush he fled till atlength he came to a rock above the river and was obliged to stand</s>  thenthere we fought</s>  he thrust at me but i leapt over his spear thusand he gambolled into the air</s>  he thrust at me again but i bent myselfthus and he ducked his great head</s>  then he grew tired and my timecame</s>  he turned and ran round the rock and i i ran after him stabbinghim through the back thus and thus and thus till he fellcrying for mercy and rolled off the rock into the river and as herolled i snatched away his plume</s>  see is it not the plume of the deaddog umbelazi</s> cetewayo took the ornament and examined it showing it to one or two ofthe captains near him who nodded their heads gravely</s> yes he said this is the war plume of umbelazi beloved of the kingstrong and shining pillar of the great house we know it well that warplume at the sight of which many a knee has loosened</s>  and so you killedhim eaterupofelephants father of mameena you who this morningwere one of the meanest of his jackals</s>  now what reward shall i giveyou for this mighty deed o umbezi</s> a great reward o terrible one began umbezi but in an awful voicecetewayo bade him be silent</s> yes he said a great reward</s>  hearken jackal and traitor</s>  your ownwords bear witness against you</s>  you you have dared to lift your handagainst the bloodroyal and with your foul tongue to heap lies andinsults upon the name of the mighty dead</s> now understanding at last umbezi began to babble excuses yes and todeclare that all his tale was false</s>  his fat cheeks fell in he sank tohis knees</s> but cetewayo only spat towards the man after his fashion when enragedand looked round him till his eye fell upon saduko</s> saduko he said take away this slayer of the prince who boasts thathe is red with my own blood and when he is dead cast him into the riverfrom that rock on which he says he stabbed pandas son</s> saduko looked round him wildly and hesitated</s> take him away thundered cetewayo and return ere dark to make reportto me</s> then at a sign from the prince soldiers flung themselves upon themiserable umbezi and dragged him thence saduko going with them nor wasthe poor liar ever seen again</s>  as he passed by me he called to me formameenas sake to save him but i could only shake my head and bethinkme of the warning i had once given to him as to the fate of traitors</s> it may be said that this story comes straight from the history of sauland david but i can only answer that it happened</s>  circumstances thatwere not unlike ended in a similar tragedy that is all</s>  what davidsexact motives were naturally i cannot tell but it is easy to guessthose of cetewayo who although he could make war upon his brother tosecure the throne did not think it wise to let it go abroad that theroyal blood might be lightly spilt</s>  also knowing that i was a witnessof the princes death he was well aware that umbezi was but aboastful liar who hoped thus to ingratiate himself with an allpowerfulconqueror</s> well this tragic incident had its sequel</s>  it seemsto his honour beit saidthat saduko refused to be the executioner of his fatherinlawumbezi so those with him performed this office and brought him back aprisoner to cetewayo</s> when the prince learned that his direct order spoken in the accustomedand fearful formula of take him away had been disobeyed his ragewas or seemed to be great</s>  my own conviction is that he was onlyseeking a cause of quarrel against saduko who he thought was a verypowerful man who would probably treat him should opportunity arise ashe had treated umbelazi and perhaps now that the most of pandas sonswere dead except himself and the lads mtonga sikota and mkungo whohad fled into natal might even in future days aspire to the throneas the husband of the kings daughter</s>  still he was afraid or did notthink it politic at once to put out of his path this master of manylegions who had played so important a part in the battle</s>  therefore heordered him to be kept under guard and taken back to nodwengu that thewhole matter might be investigated by panda the king who still ruledthe land though henceforth only in name</s>  also he refused to allow me todepart into natal saying that i too must come to nodwengu as theremy testimony might be needed</s> so having no choice i went it being fated that i should see the endof the drama</s> chapter xv</s>  mameena claims the kisswhen i reached nodwengu i was taken ill and laid up in my wagon forabout a fortnight</s>  what my exact sickness was i do not know for i hadno doctor at hand to tell me as even the missionaries had fled thecountry</s>  fever resulting from fatigue exposure and excitement andcomplicated with fearful headachecaused i presume by the blow whichi received in the battlewere its principal symptoms</s> when i began to get better scowl and some zulu friends who came to seeme informed me that the whole land was in a fearful state of disorderand that umbelazis adherents the isigqosa were still being huntedout and killed</s>  it seems that it was even suggested by some of theusutu that i should share their fate but on this point panda was firm</s> indeed he appears to have said publicly that whoever lifted a spearagainst me his friend and guest lifted it against him and would bethe cause of a new war</s>  so the usutu left me alone perhaps because theywere satisfied with fighting for a while and thought it wisest to becontent with what they had won</s> indeed they had won everything for cetewayo was now supremeby rightof the assegaiand his father but a cipher</s>  although he remained thehead of the nation cetewayo was publicly declared to be its feetand strength was in these active feet not in the bowed and sleepinghead</s>  in fact so little power was left to panda that he could notprotect his own household</s>  thus one day i heard a great tumult andshouting proceeding apparently from the isigodhlo or royal enclosureand on inquiring what it was afterwards was told that cetewayo had comefrom the amangwe kraal and denounced nomantshali the kings wifeas umtakati or a witch</s>  more in spite of his fathers prayers andtears he had caused her to be put to death before his eyesa dreadfuland a savage deed</s>  at this distance of time i cannot remember whethernomantshali was the mother of umbelazi or of one of the other fallenprinces</s>   on rereading this history it comes back to me that she  was the mother of mtonga who was much younger than  umbelazi</s>  a</s>  q</s> a few days later when i was up and about again although i had notventured into the kraal panda sent a messenger to me with a present ofan ox</s>  on his behalf this man congratulated me on my recovery and toldme that whatever might have happened to others i was to have no fearfor my own safety</s>  he added that cetewayo had sworn to the king that nota hair of my head should be harmed in these wordshad i wished to kill watcherbynight because he fought against me icould have done so down at endondakusuka but then i ought to kill youalso my father since you sent him thither against his will with yourown regiment</s>  but i like him well who is brave and who brought me goodtidings that the prince my enemy was dead of a broken heart</s>  moreoveri wish to have no quarrel with the white house the english on accountof macumazahn so tell him that he may sleep in peace</s> the messenger said further that saduko the husband of the kingsdaughter nandie and umbelazis chief induna was to be put upon histrial on the morrow before the king and his council together withmameena daughter of umbezi and that my presence was desired at thistrial</s> i asked what was the charge against them</s>  he replied that so far assaduko was concerned there were two first that he had stirred upcivil war in the land and secondly that having pushed on umbelaziinto a fight in which many thousands perished he had played thetraitor deserting him in the midst of the battle with all hisfollowinga very heinous offence in the eyes of zulus to whateverparty they may belong</s> against mameena there were three counts of indictment</s>  first that itwas she who had poisoned sadukos child and others not masapo herfirst husband who had suffered for that crime</s>  secondly that she haddeserted saduko her second husband and gone to live with another mannamely the late prince umbelazi</s>  thirdly that she was a witch who hadenmeshed umbelazi in the web of her sorceries and thereby caused him toaspire to the succession to the throne to which he had no right andmade the isililo or cry of mourning for the dead to be heard in everykraal in zululand</s> with three such pitfalls in her narrow path mameena will have to walkcarefully if she would escape them all i said</s> yes inkoosi especially as the pitfalls are dug from side to side ofthe path and have a pointed stake set at the bottom of each of them</s>  ohmameena is already as good as dead as she deserves to be who withoutdoubt is the greatest umtakati north of the tugela</s> i sighed for somehow i was sorry for mameena though why she shouldescape when so many better people had perished because of her i did notknow and the messenger went onthe black one that is panda sent me to tell saduko that he would beallowed to see you macumazahn before the trial if he wished for heknew that you had been a friend of his and thought that you might beable to give evidence in his favour</s> and what did saduko say to that</s>  i asked</s> he said that he thanked the king but that it was not needful for himto talk with macumazahn whose heart was white like his skin and whoselips if they spoke at all would tell neither more nor less than thetruth</s>  the princess nandie who is with himfor she will not leavehim in his trouble as all others have doneon hearing these words ofsadukos said that they were true and that for this reason althoughyou were her friend she did not hold it necessary to see you either</s> upon this intimation i made no comment but my head thought as thenatives say that sadukos real reason for not wishing to see me wasthat he felt ashamed to do so and nandies that she feared to learnmore about her husbands perfidies than she knew already</s> with mameena it is otherwise went on the messenger for as soonas she was brought here with zikali the little and wise with whom itseems she has been sheltering and learned that you macumazahn wereat the kraal she asked leave to see youand is it granted</s>  i broke in hurriedly for i did not at all wish fora private interview with mameena</s> nay have no fear inkoosi replied the messenger with a smile itis refused because the king said that if once she saw you she wouldbewitch you and bring trouble on you as she does on all men</s>  it is forthis reason that she is guarded by women only no man being allowed togo near to her for on women her witcheries will not bite</s>  still theysay that she is merry and laughs and sings a great deal declaring thather life has been dull up at old zikalis and that now she is going toa place as gay as the veld in spring after the first warm rain wherethere will be plenty of men to quarrel for her and make her great andhappy</s>  that is what she says the witch who knows perhaps what the placeof spirits is like</s> then as i made no remarks or suggestions the messenger departedsaying that he would return on the morrow to lead me to the place oftrial</s> next morning after the cows had been milked and the cattle loosed fromtheir kraals he came accordingly with a guard of about thirty men allof them soldiers who had survived the great fight of the amawombe</s>  thesewarriors some of whom had wounds that were scarcely healed saluted mewith loud cries of inkoosi</s>  and baba as i stepped out of the wagonwhere i had spent a wretched night of unpleasant anticipation showingme that there were at least some zulus with whom i remained popular</s> indeed their delight at seeing me whom they looked upon as a comradeand one of the few survivors of the great adventure was quite touching</s> as we went which we did slowly their captain told me of their fearsthat i had been killed with the others and how rejoiced they were whenthey learned that i was safe</s>  he told me also that after the thirdregiment had attacked them and broken up their ring a small body ofthem from eighty to a hundred only managed to cut a way through andescape running not towards the tugela where so many thousands hadperished but up to nodwengu where they reported themselves to panda asthe only survivors of the amawombe</s> and are you safe now</s>  i asked of the captain</s> oh yes he answered</s>  you see we were the kings men notumbelazis so cetewayo bears us no grudge</s>  indeed he is obliged to usbecause we gave the usutu their stomachs full of good fighting whichis more than did those cows of umbelazis</s>  it is towards saduko thathe bears a grudge for you know my father one should never pull adrowning man out of the streamwhich is what saduko did for had it notbeen for his treachery cetewayo would have sunk beneath the water ofdeathespecially if it is only to spite a woman who hates him</s>  stillperhaps saduko will escape with his life because he is nandieshusband and cetewayo fears nandie his sister if he does not love her</s> but here we are and those who have to watch the sky all day will beable to tell of the evening weather in other words those who livewill learn</s> as he spoke we passed into the private enclosure of the isigohlooutside of which a great many people were gathered shouting talkingand quarrelling for in those days all the usual discipline of the greatplace was relaxed</s>  within the fence however that was strongly guardedon its exterior side were only about a score of councillors theking the prince cetewayo who sat upon his right the princess nandiesadukos wife a few attendants two great silent fellows armed withclubs whom i guessed to be executioners and seated in the shade in acorner that ancient dwarf zikali though how he came to be there i didnot know</s> obviously the trial was to be quite a private affair which accountedfor the unusual presence of the two slayers</s>  even my amawombe guardwas left outside the gate although i was significantly informed that ifi chose to call upon them they would hear me which was another way ofsaying that in such a small gathering i was absolutely safe</s> walking forward boldly towards panda who though he was as fat as everlooked very worn and much older than when i had last seen him i mademy bow whereon he took my hand and asked after my health</s>  then i shookcetewayos hand also as i saw that it was stretched out to me</s>  heseized the opportunity to remark that he was told that i had suffereda knock on the head in some scrimmage down by the tugela and he hopedthat i felt no ill effects</s>  i answered no though i feared that therewere a few others who had not been so fortunate especially those whohad stumbled against the amawombe regiment with whom i chanced to betravelling upon a peaceful mission of inquiry</s> it was a bold speech to make but i was determined to give him aquid pro quo and as a matter of fact he took it in very good partlaughing heartily at the joke</s> after this i saluted such of the councillors present as i knew whichwas not many for most of my old friends were dead and sat down uponthe stool that was placed for me not very far from the dwarf zikali whostared at me in a stony fashion as though he had never seen me before</s> there followed a pause</s>  then at some sign from panda a side gate inthe fence was opened and through it appeared saduko who walkedproudly to the space in front of the king to whom he gave the saluteof bayte and at a sign sat himself down upon the ground</s>  nextthrough the same gate to which she was conducted by some women camemameena quite unchanged and i think more beautiful than she had everbeen</s>  so lovely did she look indeed in her cloak of grey fur hernecklet of blue beads and the gleaming rings of copper which she woreupon her wrists and ankles that every eye was fixed upon her as sheglided gracefully forward to make her obeisance to panda</s> this done she turned and saw nandie to whom she also bowed as shedid so inquiring after the health of her child</s>  without waiting for ananswer which she knew would not be vouchsafed she advanced to me andgrasped my hand which she pressed warmly saying how glad she was tosee me safe after going through so many dangers though she thought ilooked even thinner than i used to be</s> only of saduko who was watching her with his intent and melancholyeyes she took no heed whatsoever</s>  indeed for a while i thought thatshe could not have seen him</s>  nor did she appear to recognise cetewayoalthough he stared at her hard enough</s>  but as her glance fell upon thetwo executioners i thought i saw her shudder like a shaken reed</s>  thenshe sat down in the place appointed to her and the trial began</s> the case of saduko was taken first</s>  an officer learned in zululawwhich i can assure the reader is a very intricate andwellestablished lawi suppose that he might be called a kind ofattorneygeneral rose and stated the case against the prisoner</s>  he toldhow saduko from a nobody had been lifted to a great place by theking and given his daughter the princess nandie in marriage</s>  then healleged that as would be proved in evidence the said saduko had urgedon umbelazi the prince to whose party he had attached himself tomake war upon cetewayo</s>  this war having begun at the great battle ofendondakusuka he had treacherously deserted umbelazi together withthree regiments under his command and gone over to cetewayo therebybringing umbelazi to defeat and death</s> this brief statement of the case for the prosecution being finishedpanda asked saduko whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty</s> guilty o king he answered and was silent</s> then panda asked him if he had anything to say in excuse of his conduct</s> nothing o king except that i was umbelazis man and when you oking had given the word that he and the prince yonder might fight ilike many others some of whom are dead and some alive worked for himwith all my ten fingers that he might have the victory</s> then why did you desert my son the prince in the battle</s>  asked panda</s> because i saw that the prince cetewayo was the stronger bull and wishedto be on the winning side as all men dofor no other reason answeredsaduko calmly</s> now everyone present stared not excepting cetewayo</s>  panda wholike the rest of us had heard a very different tale looked extremelypuzzled while zikali in his corner set up one of his great laughs</s> after a long pause at length the king as supreme judge began to passsentence</s>  at least i suppose that was his intention but before threewords had left his lips nandie rose and saidmy father ere you speak that which cannot be unspoken hear me</s>  it iswell known that saduko my husband was my brother umbelazis generaland councillor and if he is to be killed for clinging to the princethen i should be killed also and countless others in zululand who stillremain alive because they were not in or escaped the battle</s>  it is wellknown also my father that during that battle saduko went over tomy brother cetewayo though whether this brought about the defeat ofumbelazi i cannot say</s>  why did he go over</s>  he tells you because hewished to be on the winning side</s>  it is not true</s>  he went over in orderto be revenged upon umbelazi who had taken from him yonder witchandshe pointed with her finger at mameenayonder witch whom he loved andstill loves and whom even now he would shield even though to do sohe must make his own name shameful</s>  saduko sinned i do not deny itmy father but there sits the real traitress red with the blood ofumbelazi and with that of thousands of others who have tshoniledgone down to keep him company among the ghosts</s>  therefore o king ibeseech you spare the life of saduko my husband or if he must dielearn that i your daughter will die with him</s>  i have spoken o king</s> and very proudly and quietly she sat herself down again waiting for thefateful words</s> but those words were not spoken since panda only said let us try thecase of this woman mameena</s> thereon the law officer rose again and set out the charges againstmameena namely that it was she who had poisoned sadukos child andnot masapo that after marrying saduko she had deserted him and goneto live with the prince umbelazi and that finally she had bewitched thesaid umbelazi and caused him to make civil war in the land</s> the second charge if proved namely that this woman deserted herhusband for another man is a crime of death broke in panda abruptlyas the officer finished speaking therefore what need is there to hearthe first and the third until that is examined</s>  what do you plead tothat charge woman</s> now understanding that the king did not wish to stir up these othermatters of murder and witchcraft for some reason of his own we allturned to hear mameenas answer</s> o king she said in her low silvery voice i cannot deny that i leftsaduko for umbelazi the handsome any more than saduko can deny that heleft umbelazi the beaten for cetewayo the conqueror</s> why did you leave saduko</s>  asked panda</s> o king perhaps because i loved umbelazi for was he not called thehandsome</s>  also you know that the prince your son was one to beloved</s>  here she paused looking at poor panda who winced</s>  orperhaps because i wished to be great for was he not of the bloodroyal and had it not been for saduko would he not one day have been aking</s>  or perhaps because i could no longer bear the treatment that theprincess nandie dealt out to me she who was cruel to me and threatenedto beat me because saduko loved my hut better than her own</s>  asksaduko he knows more of these matters than i do and she gazed at himsteadily</s>  then she went on how can a woman tell her reasons o kingwhen she never knows them herself</s> a question at which some of herhearers smiled</s> now saduko rose and said slowlyhear me o king and i will give the reason that mameena hides</s>  sheleft me for umbelazi because i bade her to do so for i knew thatumbelazi desired her and i wished to tie the cord tighter which boundme to one who at that time i thought would inherit the throne</s>  alsoi was weary of mameena who quarrelled night and day with the princessnandie my inkosikazi</s> now nandie gasped in astonishment and so did i but mameena laughedand saidyes o king those were the two real reasons that i had forgotten</s>  ileft saduko because he bade me as he wished to make a present to theprince</s>  also he was tired of me for many days at a time he wouldscarcely speak to me because however kind she might be i could nothelp quarrelling with the princess nandie</s>  moreover there was anotherreason which i have forgotten i had no child and not having anychild i did not think it mattered whether i went or stayed</s>  if sadukosearches he will remember that i told him so and that he agreed withme</s> again she looked at saduko who said hurriedlyyes yes i told her so i told her that i wished for no barren cows inmy kraal</s> now some of the audience laughed outright but panda frowned</s> it seems he said that my ears are being stuffed with lies thoughwhich of these two tells them i cannot say</s>  well if the woman left theman by his own wish and that his ends might be furthered as he sayshe had put her away and therefore the fault if any is his not hers</s> so that charge is ended</s>  now woman what have you to tell us of thewitchcraft which it is said you practised upon the prince who is gonethereby causing him to make war in the land</s> little that you would wish to hear o king or that it would be seemlyfor me to speak she answered drooping her head modestly</s>  the onlywitchcraft that ever i practised upon umbelazi lies hereand shetouched her beautiful eyesand hereand she touched her curvinglipsand in this poor shape of mine which some have thought so fair</s> as for the war what had i to do with war who never spoke to umbelaziwho was so dear to meand she looked up with tears running down herfacesave of love</s>  o king is there a man among you all who wouldfear the witcheries of such a one as i and because the heavens made mebeautiful with the beauty that men must follow am i also to be killedas a sorceress</s> now to this argument neither panda nor anyone else seemed to find ananswer especially as it was well known that umbelazi had cherished hisambition to the succession long before he met mameena</s>  so that chargewas dropped and the first and greatest of the three proceeded withnamely that it was she mameena and not her husband masapo who hadmurdered nandies child</s> when this accusation was made against her for the first time i saw alittle shade of trouble flit across mameenas soft eyes</s> surely o king she said that matter was settled long ago when thendwande zikali the great nyanga smelt out masapo the wizard he whowas my husband and brought him to his death for this crime</s>  must i thenbe tried for it again</s> not so woman answered panda</s>  all that zikali smelt out was thepoison that wrought the crime and as some of that poison was found uponmasapo he was killed as a wizard</s>  yet it may be that it was not he whoused the poison</s> then surely the king should have thought of that before he diedmurmured mameena</s>  but i forget it is known that masapo was alwayshostile to the house of senzangakona</s> to this remark panda made no answer perhaps because it wasunanswerable even in a land where it was customary to kill the supposedwizard first and inquire as to his actual guilt afterwards or not atall</s>  or perhaps he thought it politic to ignore the suggestion that hehad been inspired by personal enmity</s>  only he looked at his daughternandie who rose and saidhave i leave to call a witness on this matter of the poison myfather</s> panda nodded whereon nandie said to one of the councillorsbe pleased to summon my woman nahana who waits without</s> the man went and presently returned with an elderly female who itappeared had been nandies nurse and never having married owing tosome physical defect had always remained in her service a person wellknown and much respected in her humble walk of life</s> nahana said nandie you are brought here that you may repeat to theking and his council a tale which you told to me as to the coming ofa certain woman into my hut before the death of my firstborn son andwhat she did there</s>  say first is this woman present here</s> aye inkosazana answered nahana yonder she sits</s>  who could mistakeher</s>  and she pointed to mameena who was listening to every wordintently as a dog listens at the mouth of an antbear hole when thebeast is stirring beneath</s> then what of the woman and her deeds</s>  asked panda</s> only this o king</s>  two nights before the child that is dead was takenill i saw mameena creep into the hut of the lady nandie i who wasasleep alone in a corner of the big hut out of reach of the light of thefire</s>  at the time the lady nandie was away from the hut with her son</s> knowing the woman for mameena the wife of masapo who was on friendlyterms with the inkosazana whom i supposed she had come to visit i didnot declare myself nor did i take any particular note when i saw hersprinkle a little mat upon which the babe sadukos son was wont tobe laid with some medicine because i had heard her promise to theinkosazana a powder which she said would drive away insects</s>  only wheni saw her throw some of this powder into the vessel of warm water thatstood by the fire to be used for the washing of the child and placesomething muttering certain words that i could not catch in the strawof the doorway i thought it strange and was about to question her whenshe left the hut</s>  as it happened o king but a little while afterwardsbefore one could count ten tens indeed a messenger came to the hut totell me that my old mother lay dying at her kraal four days journeyfrom nodwengu and prayed to see me before she died</s>  then i forgot allabout mameena and the powder and running out to seek the princessnandie i craved her leave to go with the messenger to my motherskraal which she granted to me saying that i need not return until mymother was buried</s> so i went</s>  but oh</s>  my mother took long to die</s>  whole moons passedbefore i shut her eyes and all this while she would not let me go norindeed did i wish to leave her whom i loved</s>  at length it was over andthen came the days of mourning and after those some more days of restand after them again the days of the division of the cattle so that inthe end six moons or more had gone by before i returned to the serviceof the princess nandie and found that mameena was now the second wifeof the lord saduko</s>  also i found that the child of the lady nandie wasdead and that masapo the first husband of mameena had been smelt outand killed as the murderer of the child</s>  but as all these things wereover and done with and as mameena was very kind to me giving me giftsand sparing me tasks and as i saw that saduko my lord loved her muchit never came into my head to say anything of the matter of the powderthat i saw her sprinkle on the mat</s> after she had run away with the prince who is dead however i did tellthe lady nandie</s>  moreover the lady nandie in my presence searchedin the straw of the doorway of the hut and found there wrapped in softhide certain medicines such as the nyangas sell wherewith those whoconsult them can bewitch their enemies or cause those whom they desireto love them or to hate their wives or husbands</s>  that is all i know ofthe story o king</s> do my ears hear a true tale nandie</s>  asked panda</s>  or is this woman aliar like others</s> i think not my father see here is the muti medicine which nahanaand i found hid in the doorway of the hut that i have kept unopened tillthis day</s> and she laid on the ground a little leather bag very neatly sewn withsinews and fastened round its neck with a fibre string</s> panda directed one of the councillors to open the bag which the mandid unwillingly enough since evidently he feared its evil influencepouring out its contents on to the back of a hide shield which wasthen carried round so that we might all look at them</s>  these so far asi could see consisted of some withered roots a small piece of humanthigh bone such as might have come from the skeleton of an infant thathad a little stopper of wood in its orifice and what i took to be thefang of a snake</s> panda looked at them and shrank away sayingcome hither zikali the old you who are skilled in magic and tell uswhat is this medicine</s> then zikali rose from the corner where he had been sitting so silentlyand waddled heavily across the open space to where the shield lay infront of the king</s>  as he passed mameena she bent down over the dwarfand began to whisper to him swiftly but he placed his hands upon hisbig head covering up his ears as i suppose that he might not hear herwords</s> what have i to do with this matter o king</s>  he asked</s> much it seems o openerofroads said panda sternly seeing thatyou were the doctor who smelt out masapo and that it was in your kraalthat yonder woman hid herself while her lover the prince my son whois dead went down to the battle and that she was brought thence withyou</s>  tell us now the nature of this muti and being wise as you arebe careful to tell us truly lest it should be said o zikali that youare not a nyanga only but an umtakati as well</s>  for then he added withmeaning and choosing his words carefully perchance o zikali i mightbe tempted to make trial of whether or no it is true that you cannotbe killed like other men especially as i have heard of late that yourheart is evil towards me and my house</s> for a moment zikali hesitatedi think to give his quick brain timeto work for he saw his great danger</s>  then he laughed in his dreadfulfashion and saidoho</s>  the king thinks that the otter is in the trap and he glancedat the fence of the isigohlo and at the fierce executioners who stoodwatching him sternly</s>  well many times before has this otter seemed tobe in a trap yes ere your father saw light o son of senzangakonaand after it also</s>  yet here he stands living</s>  make no trial o king ofwhether or no i be mortal lest if death should come to such a one as ihe should take many others with him also</s>  have you not heard the sayingthat when the openerofroads comes to the end of his road there will beno more a king of the zulus as when he began his road there was no kingof the zulus since the days of his manhood are the days of all thezulu kings</s> thus he spoke glaring at panda and at cetewayo who shrank before hisgaze</s> remember he went on that the black one who is gone down long agothe wild beast who fathered the zulu herd threatened him whom he namedthe thingthatshouldnothavebeenborn aye and slew those whom heloved and afterwards was slain by others who also are gone downand that you alone o panda did not threaten him and that you aloneo panda have not been slain</s>  now if you would make trial of whether idie as other men die bid your dogs fall on for zikali is ready andhe folded his arms and waited</s> indeed all of us waited breathlessly for we understood that theterrible dwarf was matching himself against panda and cetewayo anddefying them both</s>  presently it became obvious that he had won the gamesince panda only saidwhy should i slay one whom i have befriended in the past and why doyou speak such heavy words of death in my ears o zikali the wisewhich of late have heard so much of death</s>  he sighed adding bepleased now to tell us of this medicine or if you will not go and iwill send for other nyangas</s> why should i not tell you when you ask me softly and without threatso king</s>  seeand zikali took up some of the twisted rootsthese arethe roots of a certain poisonous herb that blooms at night on the topsof mountains and woe be to the ox that eats thereof</s>  they have beenboiled in gall and blood and ill will befall the hut in which they arehidden by one who can speak the words of power</s>  this is the bone of ababe that has never lived to cut its

serpent that after it has been doctored isused by women to change the heart of a man from another to herself</s>  ihave spoken</s> and he turned to go</s> stay</s>  said the king</s>  who set these foul charms in the doorway ofsadukos hut</s> how can i tell o king unless i make preparation and cast the bonesand smell out the evildoer</s>  you have heard the story of the womannahana</s>  accept it or reject it as your heart tells you</s> if that story be true o zikali how comes it that you yourself smeltout not mameena the wife of masapo but masapo her husband himselfand caused him to be slain because of the poisoning of the child ofnandie</s> you err o king</s>  i zikali smelt out the house of masapo</s>  then ismelt out the poison searching for it first in the hair of mameena andfinding it in the kaross of masapo</s>  i never smelt out that it was masapowho gave the poison</s>  that was the judgment of you and of your councilo king</s>  nay i knew well that there was more in the matter and had youpaid me another fee and bade me to continue to use my wisdom withoutdoubt i should have found this magic stuff hidden in the hut and mayhaphave learned the name of the hider</s>  but i was weary who am very oldand what was it to me if you chose to kill masapo or chose to let himgo</s>  masapo who being your secret enemy was a man who deserved todieif not for this matter then for others</s> now all this while i had been watching mameena who sat in the zulufashion listening to this deadly evidence a slight smile upon herface and without attempting any interruption or comment</s>  only i sawthat while zikali was examining the medicine her eyes were seekingthe eyes of saduko who remained in his place also silent and to allappearance the least interested of anyone present</s>  he tried to avoidher glance turning his head uneasily but at length her eyes caught hisand held them</s>  then his heart began to beat quickly his breast heavedand on his face there grew a look of dreamy content even of happiness</s> from that moment forward till the end of the scene saduko never tookhis eyes off this strange woman though i think that with the exceptionof the dwarf zikali who saw everything and of myself who am trainedto observation none noted this curious byplay of the drama</s> the king began to speak</s>  mameena he said you have heard</s>  haveyou aught to say</s>  for if not it would seem that you are a witch and amurderess and one who must die</s> yea a little word o king she answered quietly</s>  nahana speakstruth</s>  it is true that i entered the hut of nandie and set the medicinethere</s>  i say it because by nature i am not one who hides the truth orwould attempt to throw discredit even upon a humble servingwoman andshe glanced at nahana</s> then from between your own teeth it is finished said panda</s> not altogether o king</s>  i have said that i set the medicine in the hut</s> i have not said and i will not say how and why i set it there</s>  thattale i call upon saduko yonder to tell to you he who was my husbandthat i left for umbelazi and who being a man must therefore hate me</s> by the words he says i will abide</s>  if he declares that i am guilty theni am guilty and prepared to pay the price of guilt</s>  but if he declaresthat i am innocent then o king and o prince cetewayo without feari trust myself to your justness</s>  now speak o saduko speak the wholetruth whatever it may be if that is the kings will</s> it is my will said panda</s> and mine also added cetewayo who i could see like everyone elsewas much interested in this matter</s> saduko rose to his feet the same saduko that i had always known andyet so changed</s>  all the life and fire had gone from him his pridein himself was no more none could have known him for that ambitiousconfident man who in his day of power the zulus named theselfeater</s>  he was a mere mask of the old saduko informed by somenew some alien spirit</s>  with dull lacklustre eyes fixed always uponthe lovely eyes of mameena in slow and hesitating tones he began histale</s> it is true o lion he said that mameena spread the poison upon mychilds mat</s>  it is true that she set the deadly charms in the doorway ofnandies hut</s>  these things she did not knowing what she did and it wasi who instructed her to do them</s>  this is the case</s>  from the beginning ihave always loved mameena as i have loved no other woman and as no otherwoman was ever loved</s>  but while i was away with macumazahn who sitsyonder to destroy bangu chief of the amakoba he who had killed myfather umbezi the father of mameena he whom the prince cetewayo gaveto the vultures the other day because he had lied as to the death ofumbelazi he i say forced mameena against her will to marry masapothe boar who afterwards was executed for wizardry</s>  now here at yourfeast when you reviewed the people of the zulus o king after you hadgiven me the lady nandie as wife mameena and i met again and loved eachother more than we had ever done before</s>  but being an upright womanmameena thrust me away from her sayingi have a husband who if he is not dear to me still is my husbandand while he lives to him i will be true</s>  then o king i took counselwith the evil in my heart and made a plot in myself to be rid of theboar masapo so that when he was dead i might marry mameena</s>  thiswas the plot that i madethat my son and princess nandies should bepoisoned and that masapo should seem to poison him so that he might bekilled as a wizard and i marry mameena</s> now at this astounding statement which was something beyond theexperience of the most cunning and cruel savage present there a gasp ofastonishment went up from the audience even old zikali lifted his headand stared</s>  nandie too shaken out of her usual calm rose as thoughto speak then looking first at saduko and next at mameena sat herselfdown again and waited</s>  but saduko went on again in the same coldmeasured voicei gave mameena a powder which i had bought for two heifers from a greatdoctor who lived beyond the tugela but who is now dead which powderi told her was desired by nandie my inkosikazi to destroy the littlebeetles than ran about the hut and directed her where she was to spreadit</s>  also i gave her the bag of medicine telling her to thrust it intothe doorway of the hut that it might bring a blessing upon my house</s> these things she did ignorantly to please me not knowing that thepowder was poison not knowing that the medicine was bewitched</s>  somy child died as i wished it to die and indeed i myself fell sickbecause by accident i touched the powder</s> afterwards masapo was smelt out as a wizard by old zikali i havingcaused a bag of the poison to be sewn in his kaross in order to deceivezikali and killed by your order o king and mameena was given to me asa wife also by your order o king which was what i desired</s>  later onas i have told you i wearied of her and wishing to please the princewho has wandered away i commanded her to yield herself to him whichmameena did out of her love for me and to advance my fortunes she whois blameless in all things</s> saduko finished speaking and sat down again as an automaton might dowhen a wire is pulled his lacklustre eyes still fixed upon mameenasface</s> you have heard o king said mameena</s>  now pass judgment knowingthat if it be your will i am ready to die for sadukos sake</s> but panda sprang up in a rage</s> take him away</s>  he said pointing to saduko</s>  take away that dog whois not fit to live a dog who eats his own child that thereby he maycause another to be slain unjustly and steal his wife</s> the executioners leapt forward and having something to say for icould bear this business no longer i began to rise to my feet</s>  before igained them however zikali was speaking</s> o king he said it seems that you have killed one man unjustly onthis matter namely masapo</s>  would you do the same by another</s>
 and hepointed to saduko</s> what do you mean</s>
 asked panda angrily</s>  have you not heard thislow fellow whom i made great giving him the rule over tribes and mydaughter in marriage confess with his own lips that he murdered hischild the child of my blood in order that he might eat a fruitwhich grew by the roadside for all men to nibble at</s>  and he glared atmameena</s> aye child of senzangakona answered zikali i heard saduko say thiswith his own lips but the voice that spoke from the lips was not thevoice of saduko as were you a skilled nyanga like me you wouldhave known as well as i do and as well as does the white manwatcherbynight who is a reader of hearts</s> hearken now o king and you great ones around the king and i willtell you a story</s>  matiwane the father of saduko was my friend as hewas yours o king and when bangu slew him and his people by leave ofthe wild beast chaka i saved the child his son aye and brought himup in my own house having learned to love him</s>  then when he became aman i the openerofroads showed him two roads down either of whichhe might choose to walkthe road of wisdom and the road of war andwomen the white road that runs through peace to knowledge and the redroad that runs through blood to death</s> but already there stood one upon this red road who beckoned him shewho sits yonder and he followed after her as i knew he would</s>  fromthe beginning she was false to him taking a richer man for her husband</s> then when saduko grew great she grew sorry and came to ask my counselas to how she might be rid of masapo whom she swore she hated</s>  i toldher that she could leave him for another man or wait till her spiritmoved him from her path but i never put evil into her heart seeingthat it was there already</s> then she and no other having first made saduko love her more thanever murdered the child of nandie his inkosikazi and so broughtabout the death of masapo and crept into sadukos arms</s>  hereshe slept a while till a new shadow fell upon her that of theelephantwiththetuftofhair who will walk the woods no more</s>  himshe beguiled that she might grow great the quicker and left the houseof saduko taking his heart with her she who was destined to be thedoom of men</s> now into sadukos breast where his heart had been entered an evilspirit of jealousy and of revenge and in the battle of endondakusukathat spirit rode him as a white man rides a horse</s>  as he had arrangedto do with the prince cetewayo yondernay deny it not o prince for iknow all did you not make a bargain together on the third night beforethe battle among the bushes and start apart when the buck leapt outbetween you</s>  here cetewayo who had been about to speak threw thecorner of his kaross over his face</s>  as he had arranged to do i sayhe went over with his regiments from the isigqosa to the usutu and sobrought about the fall of umbelazi and the death of many thousands</s>  yesand this he did for one reason onlybecause yonder woman had left himfor the prince and he cared more for her than for all the world couldgive him for her who had filled him with madness as a bowl is filledwith milk</s>  and now o king you have heard this man tell you a storyyou have heard him shout out that he is viler than any man in all theland that he murdered his own child the child he loved so well to winthis witch that afterwards he gave her to his friend and lord to buymore of his favour and that lastly he deserted that lord because hethought that there was another lord from whom he could buy more favour</s> is it not so o king</s> it is so answered panda and therefore must saduko be thrown out tothe jackals</s> wait a while o king</s>  i say that saduko has spoken not with his ownvoice but with the voice of mameena</s>  i say that she is the greatestwitch in all the land and that she has drugged him with the medicineof her eyes so that he knows not what he says even as she drugged theprince who is dead</s> then prove it or he dies</s>  exclaimed the king</s> now the dwarf went to panda and whispered in his ear whereon pandawhispered in turn into the ears of two of his councillors</s>  these menwho were unarmed rose and made as though to leave the isigohlo</s>  butas they passed mameena one of them suddenly threw his arms about herpinioning her arms the other tearing off the kaross he worefor theweather was coldflung it over her head and knotted it behind her sothat she was hidden except for her ankles and feet</s>  then although shedid not move or struggle they caught hold of her and stood still</s> now zikali hobbled to saduko and bade him rise which he did</s>  then helooked at him for a long while and made certain movements with his handsbefore his face after which saduko uttered a great sigh and staredabout him</s> saduko said zikali i pray you tell me your fosterfather whetherit is true as men say that you sold your wife mameena to the princeumbelazi in order that his favour might fall on you like heavy rain</s> wow</s>  zikali said saduko with a start of rage if were you as othersare i would kill you you toad who dare to spit slander on my name</s> she ran away with the prince having beguiled him with the magic of herbeauty</s> strike me not saduko went on zikali or at least wait to strikeuntil you have answered one more question</s>  is it true as men say thatin the battle of endondakusuka you went over to the usutu with yourregiments because you thought that indhlovuenesihlonti would bebeaten and wished to be on the side of him who won</s> what toad</s>  more slander</s>  cried saduko</s>  i went over for one reasononlyto be revenged upon the prince because he had taken from meher who was more to me than life or honour</s>  aye and when i went overumbelazi was winning it was because i went that he lost and died as imeant that he should die though now he added sadly i would that ihad not brought him to ruin and the dust who think that like myselfhe was but wet clay in a womans fingers</s> o king he added turning to panda kill me i pray you who am notworthy to live since to him whose hand is red with the blood of hisfriend death alone is left who while he breathes must share hissleep with ghosts that watch him with their angry eyes</s> then nandie sprang up and saidnay father listen not to him who is mad and therefore holy</s> what he has done he has done who as he has said was but a tool inanothers hand</s>  as for our babe i know well that he would have diedsooner than harm it for he loved it much and when it was taken awayfor three whole days and nights

insane people are inspired</s>  a</s> q</s> be silent daughter said the king and you o zikali the nyanga besilent also</s> they obeyed and after thinking awhile panda made a motion with hishand whereon the two councillors lifted the kaross from off mameenawho looked about her calmly and asked if she were taking part in somechilds game</s> aye woman answered panda you are taking part in a great game butnot i think such as is played by childrena game of life and death</s> now have you heard the tale of zikali the little and wise and thewords of saduko who was once your husband or must they be repeated toyou</s> there is no need o king my ears are too quick to be muffled by a furbag and i would not waste your time</s> then what have you to say woman</s> not much she answered with a shrug of her shoulders except that ihave lost in this game</s>  you will not believe me but if you had left mealone i should have told you so who did not wish to see that poor foolsaduko killed for

zulus and as it chances by the weight of a hair i have lost</s> i thought that i had counted everything but the hairs weight whichturned the balance against me was the mad jealousy of this fool

cattle of the bangu and we had fought the battle in the pass</s> oh</s>  i said is it so</s>  then lead me to tshoza and i will give youa scotchman</s>  that is a twoshilling piece so called because someenterprising emigrant from scotland passed off a vast number of themamong the simple natives of natal as substitutes for halfcrowns</s> tempted by this liberal offerand it was very liberal because i wasanxious to get to tshozas kraal before its inhabitants went to bedthemeditative kafir consented to guide me by a dark and devious path thatran through bush and dripping fields of corn</s>  at length we arrivedforif the kraal was only half a mile away the path to it covered fully twomilesand glad enough was i when we had waded the last stream and foundourselves at its gate</s> in response to the usual inquiries conducted amid a chorus of yappingdogs i was informed that tshoza did not live there but somewhere elsethat he was too old to see anyone that he had gone to sleep and couldnot be disturbed that he was dead and had been buried last week and soforth</s> look here my friend i said at last to the fellow who was telling meall these lies you go to tshoza in his grave and say to him that if hedoes not come out alive instantly macumazahn will deal with his cattleas once he dealt with those of bangu</s> impressed with the strangeness of this message the man departed andpresently in the dim light of the rainwashed moon i perceived alittle old man running towards me for tshoza who was pretty ancientat the beginning of this history had not been made younger by a severewound at the battle of the tugela and many other troubles</s> macumazahn he said is that really you</s>  why i heard that youwere dead long ago yes and sacrificed an ox for the welfare of yourspirit</s> and ate it afterwards ill be bound i answered</s> oh</s>  it must be you he went on who cannot be deceived for it istrue we ate that ox combining the sacrifice to your spirit with

spoke</s>  oh</s>  of course heis here</s>  you know i came away with him from zululand</s>  why</s>  well totell the truth because after the part we had playedagainst my willmacumazahnat the battle of endondakusuka i thought it safer to beaway from a country where those who have worn their karosses inside outfind many enemies and few friends</s> quite so i said</s>  but about saduko</s> oh i told you did i not</s>  he is in the next hut and dying</s> dying</s>  what of tshoza</s> i dont know he answered mysteriously but i think he must bebewitched</s>  for a long while a year or more he has eaten little andcannot bear to be alone in the dark indeed ever since he left zululandhe has been very strange and moody</s> now i remembered what old zikali had said to me years before to theeffect that saduko was living with a ghost which would kill him</s> does he think much about umbelazi tshoza</s>  i asked</s> o macumazana he thinks of nothing else the spirit of umbelazi is inhim day and night</s> indeed i said</s>  can i see him</s> i dont know macumazahn</s>  i will go and ask the lady nandie at oncefor if you can i believe there is no time to lose</s>  and he left thehut</s> ten minutes later he returned with a woman nandie the sweet herselfthe same quiet dignified nandie whom i used to know only now somewhatworn with trouble and looking older than her years</s> greeting macumazahn she said</s>  i am pleased to see you although itis strange very strange that you should come here just at this time</s> saduko is leaving uson a long journey macumazahn</s> i answered that i had heard so with grief and wondered whether he wouldlike to see me</s> yes very much macumazahn only be prepared to find him different fromthe saduko whom you knew</s>  be pleased to follow me</s> so we went out of tshozas hut across a courtyard to another large hutwhich we entered</s>  it was lit with a good lamp of european make also abright fire burned upon the hearth so that the place was as light asday</s>  at the side of the hut a man lay upon some blankets watched by awoman</s>  his eyes were covered with his hand and he was moaningdrive him away</s>  drive him away</s>  cannot he suffer me to die in peace</s> would you drive away your old friend macumazahn saduko</s>  asked nandievery gently macumazahn who has come from far to see you</s> he sat up and the blankets falling off him showed me that he wasnothing but a living skeleton</s>  oh</s>  how changed from that lithe andhandsome chief whom i used to know</s>  moreover his lips quivered and hiseyes were full of terrors</s> is it really you macumazahn</s>  he said in a weak voice</s>  come thenand stand quite close to me so that he may not get between us and hestretched out his bony hand</s> i took the hand it was icy cold</s> yes yes it is i saduko i said in a cheerful voice and there isno man to get between us only the lady nandie your wife and myselfare in the hut she who watched you has gone</s> oh no macumazahn there is another in the hut whom you cannot see</s> there he stands and he pointed towards the hearth</s>  look</s>  the spear isthrough him and his
