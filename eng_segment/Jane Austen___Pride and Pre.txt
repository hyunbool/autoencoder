hewas much handsomer than mr</s>  bingley and he was looked at with greatadmiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgustwhich turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to beproud to be above his company and above being pleased and not allhis large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a mostforbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be comparedwith his friend</s> mr</s>  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principalpeople in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dancewas angry that the

mrs</s>  bennet whose dislike ofhis general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by hishaving slighted one of her daughters</s> elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sitdown for two dances and during part of that time mr</s>  darcy had beenstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr</s> bingley who came from the dance for a

certainly shall not</s>  you know how i detest it unless i amparticularly acquainted with my partner</s>  at such an assembly as thisit would be insupportable</s>  your sisters are engaged and there

had agood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raisedsuch splendid expectations</s>  he had rather hoped that his wifes views onthe stranger would be disappointed but he soon found out that he had adifferent story to hear</s> oh</s>  my dear mr</s>  bennet as she entered the room we have had a mostdelightful evening a most excellent ball</s>  i wish you had been there</s> jane was so admired nothing could be like it</s>  everybody said how wellshe looked and mr</s>  bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced withher twice</s>  only think of that my dear he actually danced with hertwice</s>  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a secondtime</s>  first of all he asked miss lucas</s>  i was so vexed to see him standup with her</s>  but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobodycan you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was goingdown the dance</s>  so he inquired who she was and got introduced andasked her for the two next</s>  then the two third he danced with miss kingand the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane againand the two sixth with lizzy and the boulangerif he had had any compassion for

quite delighted with him</s>  he is so excessivelyhandsome</s>  and his sisters are charming women</s>  i never in my life sawanything more elegant than their dresses</s>  i dare say the lace upon mrs</s> hursts gownhere she was interrupted again</s>  mr</s>  bennet protested against anydescription of finery</s>  she was therefore obliged to seek another branchof the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and someexaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr</s>  darcy</s> but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by notsuiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not atall worth pleasing</s>
 he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so verygreat</s>  not handsome enough to dance with</s>  i wish you had been there mydear to have given him one of your setdowns</s>  i quite detest the man</s> chapter 4when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious inher praise of mr</s>  bingley before expressed to her sister just how verymuch she admired him</s> he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensiblegoodhumoured lively and i never saw such happy manners</s> so muchease with such perfect good breeding</s> he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man oughtlikewise to be if he possibly can</s>  his character is thereby complete</s> i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time</s>  idid not expect such a compliment</s> did not you</s>  i did for you</s>  but that is one great difference betweenus</s>  compliments always take you by surprise and me never</s>  whatcould be more natural than his asking you again</s>  he could not helpseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other womanin the room</s>  no thanks to his gallantry for that</s>  well he certainly isvery agreeable and i give you leave to like him</s>  you have liked many astupider person</s> dear lizzy</s> oh</s>  you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general</s> you never see a fault in anybody</s>  all the world are good and agreeablein your eyes</s>  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in yourlife</s> i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone but i always speakwhat i think</s> i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder</s>  with yourgood sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense ofothers</s>  affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with iteverywhere</s>  but to be candid without ostentation or designto take thegood of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothingof the badbelongs to you alone</s>  and so you like this mans sisterstoo do you</s>
 their manners are not equal to his</s> certainly notat first</s>  but they are very pleasing women when youconverse with them</s>  miss bingley is to live with her brother and keephis house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charmingneighbour in her</s> elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour atthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with morequickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sisterand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself shewas very little disposed to approve them</s>  they were in fact very fineladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in thepower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it but proud andconceited</s>  they were rather handsome

therefore in every respectentitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others</s>  they were ofa respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeplyimpressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and theirown had been acquired by trade</s> mr</s>  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundredthousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase anestate but did not live to do it</s>  mr</s>  bingley intended it likewise andsometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with agood house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of thosewho best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend theremainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation topurchase</s> his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own butthough he was now only established as a tenant miss bingley was by nomeans unwilling to preside at his tablenor was mrs</s>  hurst who hadmarried a man

his judgement the highest opinion</s> in understanding darcy was the superior</s>  bingley was by no meansdeficient but darcy was clever</s>  he was at the same time haughtyreserved and fastidious and his manners though wellbred were notinviting</s>  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage</s>  bingleywas sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continuallygiving offense</s> the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficientlycharacteristic</s>  bingley had never met with more pleasant people orprettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentiveto him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon feltacquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could notconceive an angel more beautiful</s>  darcy on the contrary had seen acollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion fornone of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none receivedeither attention or pleasure</s>  miss bennet he acknowledged to be prettybut she smiled too much</s> mrs</s>  hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admiredher and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and onewhom they would not object to know more of</s>  miss bennet was thereforeestablished as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorized by suchcommendation to think of her as he chose</s> chapter 5within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennetswere particularly intimate</s>  sir william lucas had been formerly in tradein meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to thehonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty</s> the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly</s>  it had given him adisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market townand in quitting them both he had removed with his family to a houseabout a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodgewhere he could think with pleasure of his own

miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks muchunless among his intimate acquaintances</s>  with them he is remarkablyagreeable</s> i do not believe a word of it my dear</s>  if he had been so veryagreeable he would have talked to mrs</s>  long</s>  but i can guess how itwas everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he hadheard somehow that mrs</s>  long does not keep a

that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgivehis pride if he had not mortified mine</s> pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of herreflections is a very common failing i believe</s>  by all that i haveever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that humannature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of uswho do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of somequality or other real or imaginary</s>  vanity and pride are differentthings though the words are often used synonymously</s>  a person maybe proud

were to see you at it i should take away your bottledirectly</s> the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that shewould and the argument ended only with the visit</s> chapter 6the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield</s>  the visitwas soon returned in due form</s>  miss bennets pleasing manners grew onthe goodwill of mrs</s>  hurst and miss bingley and though the mother wasfound to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking toa wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towardsthe two eldest</s>  by jane this attention was received with the greatestpleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatmentof everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like themthough their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising inall probability from the influence of their brothers admiration</s>  itwas generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her andto her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preferencewhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in away to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that itwas not likely to be discovered by the world in general since janeunited with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and auniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicionsof the impertinent</s>  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas</s> it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to imposeon the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to beso very guarded</s>  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skillfrom the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him andit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally inthe dark</s>  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost everyattachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself</s>  we can allbegin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there arevery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love withoutencouragement</s>  in nine cases out of ten a women had better show moreaffection than she feels</s>  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but hemay never do more than like her if she does not help him on</s> but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow</s>  if i canperceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not todiscover it too</s> remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do</s> but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to concealit he must find it out</s> perhaps he must if he sees enough of her</s>  but though bingley and janemeet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as theyalways see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible thatevery moment should be employed in conversing together</s>  jane shouldtherefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command hisattention</s>  when she is secure of him there will be more leisure forfalling in love as much as she chooses</s> your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is inquestion but the desire of being well married and if i were determinedto get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it</s>  butthese are not janes feelings she is not acting by design</s>  as yetshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of itsreasonableness</s>  she has known him only a fortnight</s>  she danced fourdances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own houseand has since dined with him in company four times</s>  this is not quiteenough to make her understand his character</s> not as you represent it</s>  had she merely dined with him she mightonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you mustremember that four evenings have also been spent togetherand fourevenings may do a great deal</s> yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that theyboth like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any otherleading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded</s> well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart andif she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good achance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for atwelvemonth</s>  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance</s>  ifthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other orever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in theleast</s>  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards tohave their share of vexation and it is better to know as little aspossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass yourlife</s> you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound</s>  you know it is notsound and that you would never act in this way yourself</s> occupied in observing mr</s>  bingleys attentions to her sister elizabethwas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of someinterest in the eyes of his friend</s>  mr</s>  darcy had at first scarcelyallowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at theball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise</s>  but nosooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardlyhad a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendereduncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes</s>  tothis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying</s>  though he haddetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetryin her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light andpleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not thoseof the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness</s>  ofthis she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who madehimself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enoughto dance with</s> he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversingwith her himself attended to her conversation with others</s>  his doing sodrew her notice</s>  it was at sir william lucass where a

on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to haveany intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention sucha subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it sheturned to him and saiddid you not think mr</s>  darcy that i expressed myself uncommonlywell just now when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball atmeryton</s> with great energy but it

certainly not</s> to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it isabove her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone</s>  what could she mean byit</s>  it seems to me to show an

miss bingley in a half whisper thatthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes</s> not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise</s>  ashort pause followed this speech and mrs</s>  hurst began againi have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a verysweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled</s>  but withsuch a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there isno chance of it</s> i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney inmeryton</s> yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside</s> that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily</s> if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley itwould not make them one jot less agreeable</s> but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of anyconsideration in the world replied darcy</s> to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it theirhearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense oftheir dear friends vulgar relations</s> with a renewal of tenderness however they returned to her room onleaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee</s> she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all tilllate in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep andwhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should godownstairs herself</s>  on entering the drawingroom she found the wholeparty at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspectingthem to be playing high she declined it and making her sister theexcuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could staybelow with a book</s>  mr</s>  hurst looked at her with astonishment</s> do you prefer reading to cards</s>  said he that is rather singular</s> miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards</s>  she is a greatreader and has no pleasure in anything else</s> i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i amnot a great reader and i have pleasure in many things</s> in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley andi hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well</s> elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards thetable where a few books were lying</s>  he immediately offered to fetch herothersall that his library afforded</s> and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my owncredit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have morethan i ever looked into</s> elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with thosein the room</s> i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have leftso small a collection of books</s>  what a delightful library you have atpemberley mr</s>  darcy</s> it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of manygenerations</s> and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buyingbooks</s> i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days asthese</s> neglect</s>  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties ofthat noble place</s>  charles when you build your house i wish it may behalf as delightful as pemberley</s> i wish it may</s> but i would really advise you to make your purchase in thatneighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model</s>  there is not afiner county in england than derbyshire</s> with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it</s> i am talking of possibilities charles</s> upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to getpemberley by purchase than by imitation</s> elizabeth was so much caught with what passed as to leave her verylittle attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drewnear the cardtable and stationed herself between mr</s>  bingley and hiseldest sister to observe the game</s> is miss darcy much grown since the spring</s>  said miss bingley willshe be as tall as i am</s> i think she will</s>  she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height orrather taller</s> how i long to see her again</s>  i never met with anybody who delighted meso much</s>  such a countenance such manners</s>  and so extremely accomplishedfor her age</s>  her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite</s> it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patienceto be so very accomplished as they all are</s> all young ladies accomplished</s>  my dear charles what do you mean</s> yes all of them i think</s>  they all paint tables cover screens andnet purses</s>  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this and i am surei never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without beinginformed that she was very accomplished</s> your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy hastoo much truth</s>  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it nootherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen</s>  but i am veryfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general</s>  icannot boast of knowing more than halfadozen in the whole range of myacquaintance that are really accomplished</s> nor i i am sure said miss bingley</s> then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in youridea of an accomplished woman</s> yes i do comprehend a great deal in it</s> oh</s>  certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be reallyesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually metwith</s>  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawingdancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besidesall this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner ofwalking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the wordwill be but halfdeserved</s> all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she mustyet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind byextensive reading</s> i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women</s> i rather wonder now at your knowing any</s> are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of allthis</s> i never saw such a woman</s>  i never saw such capacity and taste andapplication and elegance as you describe united</s> mrs</s>  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of herimplied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women whoanswered this description when mr</s>  hurst called them to order withbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward</s>  as allconversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left theroom</s> elizabeth bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on heris one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to theother sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say itsucceeds</s>  but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art</s> undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressedthere is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescendto employ for captivation</s>  whatever bears affinity to cunning isdespicable</s> miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as tocontinue the subject</s> elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse andthat she could not leave her</s>  bingley urged mr</s>  jones being sent forimmediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice couldbe of any service recommended an express to town for one of the mosteminent physicians</s>  this she would not hear of but she was not sounwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settledthat mr</s>  jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennetwere not decidedly better</s>  bingley was quite uncomfortable his sistersdeclared that they were miserable</s>  they solaced their wretchednesshowever by duets after supper while he could find no better reliefto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that everyattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister</s> chapter 9elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in themorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to theinquiries which she very early received from mr</s>  bingley by a housemaidand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on hissisters</s>  in spite of this amendment however she requested to have anote sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form herown judgement of her situation</s>  the note was immediately dispatched andits contents as quickly complied with</s>  mrs</s>  bennet accompanied by hertwo youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast</s> had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs</s>  bennet would have beenvery miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness wasnot alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as herrestoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield</s>  shewould not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carriedhome neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time thinkit at all advisable</s>  after sitting a little while with jane on missbingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters allattended her into the breakfast parlour</s>  bingley met them with hopesthat mrs</s>  bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected</s> indeed i have sir was her answer</s>  she is a great deal too ill to bemoved</s>  mr</s>  jones says we must not think of moving her</s>  we must trespassa little longer on your kindness</s> removed</s>  cried bingley</s>  it must not be thought of</s>  my sister i amsure will not hear of her removal</s> you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civilitythat miss bennet will receive every possible attention while sheremains with us</s> mrs</s>  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments</s> i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do notknow what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffersa vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which isalways the way with her for she has

should have supposed of you said elizabeth</s> you begin to comprehend me do you</s>  cried he turning towards her</s> oh</s>  yesi understand you perfectly</s> i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seenthrough i am afraid is pitiful</s> that is as it happens</s>  it does not follow that a deep intricatecharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours</s> lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on inthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home</s> i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were astudier of character</s>  it must be an amusing study</s>
yes but intricate characters are the most amusing</s>  they have atleast that advantage</s> the country said darcy can in general supply but a few subjects forsuch a study</s>  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined andunvarying society</s> but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to beobserved in them for ever</s> yes indeed cried mrs</s>  bennet offended by his manner of mentioninga country neighbourhood</s>  i assure you there is quite as much of thatgoing on in the country as in town</s> everybody was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a momentturned silently away</s>  mrs</s>  bennet who fancied she had gained a completevictory over him continued her triumph</s> i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country formy part except the shops and public places</s>  the country is a vast dealpleasanter is it not mr</s>  bingley</s> when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave itand when i am in town it is pretty much the same</s>  they have each theiradvantages and i can be equally happy in either</s> ayethat is because you have the right disposition</s>  but thatgentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothingat all</s> indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for hermother</s>  you quite mistook mr</s>  darcy</s>  he only meant that there was notsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the townwhich you must acknowledge to be true</s>
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meetingwith many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are fewneighbourhoods larger</s>  i know we dine with fourandtwenty families</s> nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep hiscountenance</s>  his sister was less delicate and directed her eyes towardsmr</s>  darcy with a very expressive smile</s>  elizabeth for the sake ofsaying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her ifcharlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away</s> yes she called yesterday with her father</s>  what an agreeable man sirwilliam is mr</s>  bingley is not he</s>  so much the man of fashion</s>  sogenteel and easy</s>  he has always something to say to everybody</s>  thatis my idea of good breeding

not often see anybodybetter looking</s>  it is what everybody says</s>  i do not trust my ownpartiality</s>  when she was only fifteen there was a man at my brothergardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw wassure he would make her an offer before we came away</s>  but however hedid not</s>  perhaps he thought her too young</s>  however he wrote some verseson her and very pretty they were</s> and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently</s>  there hasbeen many a one i fancy overcome in the same way</s>  i wonder who firstdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love</s> i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy</s> of a fine stout healthy love it may</s>  everything nourishes what isstrong already</s>  but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away</s> darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabethtremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again</s>  she longed tospeak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs</s> bennet began repeating her thanks to mr</s>  bingley for his kindness tojane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy</s>  mr</s>  bingley wasunaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to becivil also and say what the occasion required</s>  she performed her partindeed without much graciousness but mrs</s>  bennet was satisfied andsoon afterwards ordered her carriage</s>  upon this signal the youngest ofher daughters put herself forward</s>  the two girls had been whispering toeach other during the whole visit and the result of it was that theyoungest should tax mr</s>  bingley with having promised on his first cominginto the country to give a ball at netherfield</s> lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexionand goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whoseaffection had brought her into public at an early age</s>  she had highanimal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which theattention of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her owneasy manners recommended her had increased into assurance</s>  she was veryequal therefore to address mr</s>  bingley on the subject of the ball andabruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the mostshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it</s>  his answer to thissudden attack was delightful to their mothers eari am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and whenyour sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day ofthe ball</s>  but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill</s> lydia declared herself satisfied</s>  oh</s>  yesit would be much better towait till jane

the day before had done</s>  mrs</s>  hurst and missbingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid whocontinued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joinedtheir party in

bymessages to his sister</s>  mr</s>  hurst and mr</s>  bingley were at piquet andmrs</s>  hurst was observing their game</s> elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused inattending to what passed between darcy and his companion</s>  the perpetualcommendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evennessof his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcernwith which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and wasexactly in union with her opinion of each</s> how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter</s> he made no

january</s>  but do youalways write such charming long letters to her mr</s>  darcy</s> they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for meto determine</s> it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter withease cannot write ill</s> that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried herbrother because he does not write with ease</s>  he studies too much forwords of four syllables</s>  do not you darcy</s> my style of writing is very different from yours</s> oh</s>  cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless wayimaginable</s>  he leaves out half his words and blots the rest</s> my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby whichmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents</s> your humility mr</s>  bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof</s> nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance ofhumility</s>  it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes anindirect boast</s> and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty</s> the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects inwriting because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity ofthought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable youthink at least highly interesting</s>  the power of doing anything withquickness is always prized much by the possessor and often without anyattention to the imperfection of the performance</s>  when you told mrs</s> bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfieldyou should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort ofpanegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so verylaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary businessundone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else</s> nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all thefoolish things that were said in the morning</s>  and yet upon my honouri believe what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at thismoment</s>  at least therefore i did not assume the character of needlessprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies</s> i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced thatyou would be gone with such celerity</s>  your conduct would be quite asdependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you weremounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had betterstay till next week you would probably do it you would probably notgoand at another word might stay a month</s> you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr</s>  bingley didnot do justice to his own disposition</s>  you have shown him off now muchmore than he did himself</s> i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what myfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper</s>  but i amafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no meansintend for he would certainly think better of me if under such acircumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as icould</s> would mr</s>  darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentionsas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it</s> upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak forhimself</s> you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call minebut which i have never acknowledged</s>  allowing the case however tostand according to your representation you must remember miss bennetthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house andthe delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offeringone argument in favour of its propriety</s> to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no meritwith you</s> to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding ofeither</s> you appear to me mr</s>  darcy to allow nothing for the influence offriendship and affection</s>  a regard for the requester would often makeone readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reasonone into it</s>  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you havesupposed about mr</s>  bingley</s>  we may as well wait perhaps till thecircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviourthereupon</s>  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friendwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of novery great moment should you think ill of that person for complyingwith the desire without waiting to be argued into it</s> will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject toarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is toappertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsistingbetween the parties</s> by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars notforgetting their comparative height and size for that will have moreweight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of</s>  i assureyou that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison withmyself i should not pay him half so much deference</s>  i declare i do notknow a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and inparticular places at his own house especially and of a sunday eveningwhen he has nothing to do</s> mr</s>  darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he wasrather offended and therefore checked her laugh</s>  miss bingley warmlyresented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with herbrother for talking such nonsense</s> i see your design bingley said his friend</s>  you dislike an argumentand want to silence this</s> perhaps i do</s>  arguments are too much like disputes</s>  if you and missbennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be verythankful and then you may say whatever you like of me</s> what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr</s> darcy had much better finish his letter</s> mr</s>  darcy took her advice and did finish his letter</s> when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabethfor an indulgence of some music</s>  miss bingley moved with some alacrityto the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would leadthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived sheseated herself</s> mrs</s>  hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employedelizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooksthat lay on the instrument how frequently mr</s>  darcys eyes were fixedon her</s>  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object ofadmiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at herbecause he disliked her was still more strange</s>  she could only imaginehowever at last that she drew his notice because there was somethingmore wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than inany other person present</s>  the supposition did not pain her</s>  she likedhim too little to care for his approbation</s> after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm bya lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr</s>  darcy drawing nearelizabeth said to herdo not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such anopportunity of dancing a reel</s> she smiled but made no answer</s>  he repeated the question with somesurprise at her silence</s> oh</s>  said she i heard you before but i could not immediatelydetermine what to say in reply</s>  you wanted me i know to say yesthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i alwaysdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person oftheir premeditated contempt</s>  i have therefore made up my mind to tellyou that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me ifyou dare</s> indeed i do not dare</s> elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at hisgallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in hermanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcyhad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her</s>  he reallybelieved that were it not for the inferiority of her connections heshould be in some danger</s> miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her greatanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received someassistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth</s> she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking oftheir supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance</s> i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubberythe next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when thisdesirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongueand if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running afterofficers</s>  and if

not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in someconfusion lest they had been overheard</s> you used us abominably ill answered mrs</s>  hurst running away withouttelling us that you were

walk is not wide enough for our party</s>  we had better go into theavenue</s> but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with themlaughingly answeredno no stay where you are</s>  you are charmingly grouped and appearto uncommon advantage</s>  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting afourth</s>  goodbye</s> she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope ofbeing at home again in a day or two</s>  jane was already so much recoveredas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening</s> chapter 11when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to hersister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into thedrawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with manyprofessions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeableas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared</s> their powers of conversation were considerable</s>  they could describe anentertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laughat their acquaintance with spirit</s> but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first objectmiss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she hadsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps</s>  he addressedhimself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr</s>  hurst alsomade her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffusenessand warmth remained for bingleys salutation</s>  he was full of joy andattention</s>  the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest sheshould suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desireto the other side of the fireplace that she might be further fromthe door</s>  he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyoneelse</s>  elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with greatdelight</s> when tea was over mr</s>  hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of thecardtablebut in vain</s>  she had obtained private intelligence that mr</s> darcy did not wish for cards and mr</s>  hurst soon found even his openpetition rejected</s>  she assured him that no one intended to play andthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her</s>  mr</s> hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of thesofas and go to sleep</s>  darcy took up a book miss bingley did the sameand mrs</s>  hurst principally occupied in playing with her braceletsand rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with missbennet</s> miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr</s> darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and shewas perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page</s>  shecould not win him however to any conversation he merely answered herquestion and read on</s>  at length quite exhausted by the attempt to beamused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was thesecond volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasantit is to spend an evening in this way</s>  i declare after all there is noenjoyment like reading</s>  how much sooner one tires of anything than of abook</s>  when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have notan excellent library</s> no one made any reply</s>  she then yawned again threw aside her book andcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearingher brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenlytowards him and saidby the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance atnetherfield</s>  i would advise you before you determine on it to consultthe wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there arenot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than apleasure</s> if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if hechooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settledthing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall sendround my cards</s> i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they werecarried on in a different manner but there is something insufferablytedious in the usual process of such a meeting</s>  it would surely be muchmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order ofthe day</s> much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not benear so much like a ball</s> miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walkedabout the room</s>  her figure was elegant and she walked well butdarcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious</s>  inthe desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more andturning to elizabeth saidmiss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take aturn about the room</s>  i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting solong in one attitude</s> elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately</s>  miss bingleysucceeded no less in the real object of her civility mr</s>  darcy lookedup</s>  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter aselizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book</s>  he wasdirectly invited to join their party but he declined it observing thathe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and downthe room together with either of which motives his joining them wouldinterfere</s>  what could he mean</s>  she was dying to know what could be hismeaning</s> and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him</s> not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severeon us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothingabout it</s> miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr</s>  darcy inanything and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of histwo motives</s> i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soonas she allowed him to speak</s>  you either choose this method of passingthe evening because you are in each others confidence and have secretaffairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figuresappear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would becompletely in your way and if the second i can admire you much

housekeepers room</s> in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansionwith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode andthe improvements it was receiving he was

mr</s>  darcy often acknowledged himself tobe under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendenceand when immediately before my fathers death mr</s>  darcy gave him avoluntary promise

assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the leastimportance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and beggedthat she would not make herself uneasy</s> i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to acardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily iam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object</s>
 thereare undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to ladycatherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regardinglittle matters</s> mr</s>  wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr</s>  collins fora few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relationwas very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh</s> lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given hima living</s>  i hardly know how mr</s>  collins was first introduced to hernotice but he certainly has not known her long</s> you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcywere sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr</s>  darcy</s> no indeed i did not</s>  i knew nothing at all of lady catherinesconnections</s>  i never heard of her existence till the day beforeyesterday</s> her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it isbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates</s>

passed between mr</s> wickham and herself</s>  jane listened with astonishment and concern sheknew not how to believe that mr</s>  darcy could be so unworthy of mr</s> bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question theveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham</s>  thepossibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough tointerest all her tender feelings

the officers and thoughthis was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence waspronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and whotold them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business theday before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smilei do not imagine his business would have called him away just now ifhe had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here</s> this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught byelizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable forwickhams absence than if her first surmise

recommenced however and darcy approached to claim herhand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be asimpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasantin the

replied and was againsilent</s>  after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second timewithit is your turn to say something now mr</s>  darcy</s>  i talkedabout the dance and you ought to make

one must speak a little you know</s>  it would look odd to beentirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage ofsome conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have thetrouble of saying as little as possible</s> are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do youimagine that you are gratifying mine</s> both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a greatsimilarity in the turn of our minds</s>  we are each of an unsocialtaciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to saysomething that will amaze the whole room and be

youthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly</s> i must not decide on my own performance</s> he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone downthe dance when he asked her if she and

acquaintance</s> the effect was immediate</s>  a deeper shade of hauteur overspread hisfeatures but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herselffor her own weakness could not go on</s>  at

of changing the subject</s>  atthat moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to passthrough the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr</s> darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him onhis dancing and his partner</s> i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir</s>  such verysuperior dancing is not often seen</s>  it is evident that you

detaining you from the bewitching converse of thatyoung lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me</s> the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sirwilliams allusion to his

partner and said sir williams interruption has mademe forget what we were talking of</s> i do not think we were speaking at all</s>  sir william could not haveinterrupted two people in the room who

do not get on at all</s>  i hear such differentaccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly</s> i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may varygreatly with respect to me and i could wish

may never have anotheropportunity</s> i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied</s> she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted insilence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degreefor in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towardsher which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger againstanother</s> they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her andwith an expression of civil disdain accosted herso miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham</s> your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousandquestions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you amonghis other communication that he was the son of old wickham the latemr</s>  darcys steward</s>  let me recommend you however as a friend not togive implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr</s>  darcysusing him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he hasalways been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treatedmr</s>  darcy in a most infamous manner</s>  i do not know the particulars buti know very well that mr</s>  darcy is not in the least to blame that hecannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brotherthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation tothe officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himselfout of the way</s>  his coming into the country at all is a most insolentthing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it</s>  i pity youmiss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but reallyconsidering his descent one could not expect much better</s> his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same saidelizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worsethan of being the son of mr</s>  darcys steward and of that i canassure you he informed me himself</s> i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer</s> excuse my interferenceit was kindly meant</s> insolent girl</s>  said elizabeth to herself</s>  you are much mistakenif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this</s>  i seenothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr</s> darcy</s>  she then sought her eldest sister who has undertaken to makeinquiries on the same subject of bingley</s>  jane met her with a smile ofsuch sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficientlymarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening</s> elizabeth instantly read her feelings

from mr</s>  darcy than he hasreceived and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sistersmr</s>  wickham is by no means a respectable young man</s>  i am afraid he hasbeen very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr</s>  darcys regard</s> mr</s>  bingley does not know mr</s>  wickham himself</s> no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton</s> this account then is what he has received from mr</s>  darcy</s>  i amsatisfied</s>  but what does he say of the living</s> he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heardthem from mr</s>  darcy more than once but he believes that it was left tohim conditionally only</s> i have not a doubt of mr</s>  bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmlybut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only</s>  mr</s> bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say butsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learntthe rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think ofboth gentlemen as i did before</s> she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and onwhich there could be no difference of sentiment</s>  elizabeth listened withdelight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr</s> bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidencein it</s>  on their being joined by mr</s>  bingley himself

 how wonderfully these sort of things occur</s>  who would havethought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine debourgh in this assembly</s>  i am most thankful that the discovery is madein time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going todo and trust he will excuse my not having done it before</s>  my totalignorance of the connection must plead my apology</s> you are not going to introduce yourself to mr</s>  darcy</s> indeed i am</s>  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier</s> i believe him to be lady catherines nephew</s>  it will be in my power toassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight</s> elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring himthat mr</s>  darcy would consider his addressing him without introductionas an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt thatit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on eitherside and that if it were it must belong to mr</s>  darcy the superior inconsequence to begin the acquaintance</s>  mr</s>  collins listened to herwith the determined air of following his own inclination and when sheceased speaking replied thusmy dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world inyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of yourunderstanding but permit me to say that there must be a widedifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laityand those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe thati consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity withthe highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility ofbehaviour is at the same time maintained</s>  you must therefore allow me tofollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me toperform what i look on as a point of duty</s>  pardon me for neglecting toprofit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constantguide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted byeducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a younglady like yourself</s>
darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whoseastonishment at being so addressed was very evident</s>  her cousin prefacedhis speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word ofit she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips thewords apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh</s>  it vexedher to see him expose himself to such a man</s>
 mr</s>  darcy was eyeing himwith unrestrained wonder and when at last mr</s>
 collins allowed him timeto speak replied with an air of distant civility</s>  mr</s>  collins howeverwas not discouraged from speaking again and mr</s>  darcys contempt seemedabundantly increasing

be dissatisfied with myreception</s>  mr</s>  darcy seemed much pleased with the attention</s>  he answeredme with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of sayingthat he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to becertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily</s>  it was really a veryhandsome thought</s>  upon the whole i am much pleased with him</s> as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turnedher attention almost entirely on her sister and mr</s>  bingley and thetrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave

circumstances ofendeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters</s>  her mothers thoughtsshe plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not toventure near her lest she might hear too much</s>  when they sat down tosupper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness whichplaced them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to findthat her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freelyopenly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soonbe married to mr</s>  bingley</s>  it was an animating subject and mrs</s>  bennetseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of thematch</s>  his being such a charming young man and so rich and living butthree miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation andthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were ofjane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much asshe could do</s>  it was moreover such a promising thing for her youngerdaughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way ofother rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to beable to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister thatshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked</s>  it wasnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because onsuch occasions it is the etiquette but no

expressionof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed andsteady gravity</s> at length however mrs</s>  bennet had no more to say and lady lucas whohad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw nolikelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham andchicken</s>  elizabeth now began to revive</s>  but not long was the interval oftranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of andshe had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreatypreparing to oblige the company</s>  by many significant looks and silententreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity ofexhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song</s>  elizabethseyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched herprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was veryill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the

that i think it a right thing forevery clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the exampleof matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it willadd very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i oughtto have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice andrecommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of callingpatroness</s>  twice has

remains to be told why my viewswere directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where ican assure you there are many amiable young women</s>  but the fact is thatbeing as i am to

to receive a more favourable answer than you have now givenme though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because iknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man onthe first application and perhaps you have even now said as much toencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of thefemale character</s> really mr</s>  collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle meexceedingly</s>  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the formof encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way asto convince you of its being one</s> you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that yourrefusal of my addresses is merely words of course</s>  my reasons forbelieving it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand isunworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer wouldbe any other than highly desirable</s>  my situation in life my connectionswith the family of de bourgh and my

when sanctioned by the expressauthority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail ofbeing acceptable</s> to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would makeno reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined ifhe persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flatteringencouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be utteredin such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least couldnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female</s> chapter 20mr</s>  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of

felicitations with equal pleasure and thenproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the resultof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since therefusal which his

be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encouragehim by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe itand could not help saying so</s> but depend upon it mr</s>  collins she added that lizzy shall bebrought to reason</s>  i will speak to her about it directly</s>  she is a veryheadstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i willmake her know it</s> pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr</s>  collins but ifshe is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she wouldaltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation whonaturally

had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarilyattending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of hermother</s>  as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chieflyexpressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid herbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence</s>  he scarcely ever spoketo her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible ofhimself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whosecivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all andespecially to her friend</s> the morrow produced no abatement of mrs</s>  bennets illhumour or illhealth</s>  mr</s>  collins was also in the same state of angry pride</s>  elizabethhad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan didnot appear in the least affected by it</s>  he was always to have gone onsaturday and to saturday he meant to stay</s> after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr</s>  wickhamwere returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball</s> he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to theiraunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody waswell talked over</s>  to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledgedthat the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed</s> i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meetmr</s>  darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for somany hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenesmight arise unpleasant to more than myself</s> she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a fulldiscussion of it and for all the commendation which they civillybestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back withthem to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended toher</s>  his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all thecompliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as anoccasion of introducing him to her father and mother</s> soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it camefrom netherfield</s>  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant littlehotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand andelizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and sawher dwelling intently on some particular passages</s>  jane recollectedherself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usualcheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxietyon the subject which drew off her attention

towardsherself</s>  such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were sofavourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almostsecure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so verysoon</s>  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of hischaracter for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the nextmorning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throwhimself at her feet</s>  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousinsfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail toconjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt knowntill its success might be known likewise for though feeling almostsecure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraginghe was comparatively diffident since the

information herself and therefore charged mr</s>  collinswhen he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what hadpassed before any of the family</s>  a promise of secrecy was of course verydutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for thecuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very directquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade

a friend disgracing herselfand sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that itwas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she hadchosen</s> chapter 23elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on whatshe had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mentionit when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter toannounce her

astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happinessnor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable</s>  kittyand lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr</s>  collins was only aclergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of newsto spread at meryton</s> lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retorton mrs</s>  bennet the comfort

complete</s> the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wonderingvisitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and hiswife was exactly what he had wished for and that

to hearme</s>  i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well</s>  thereis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at thewill of others</s>  my courage always rises at

acquaintance long enough to know that you findgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact arenot your own</s> elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said

something very dreadful</s> the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must knowwas at a balland at this ball what do you think he did</s>  he dancedonly four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certainknowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of apartner</s>  mr</s>  darcy you cannot deny the fact</s> i had not at that time the honour of knowing any

darcy i should have judged better had i sought anintroduction but i am illqualified to recommend myself to strangers</s> shall we ask your cousin the reason of this</s>  said elizabeth stilladdressing colonel fitzwilliam</s>  shall we ask him why a man of sense andeducation and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommendhimself to strangers</s> i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying tohim</s>  it is because he will not give himself the trouble</s> i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcyof conversing easily with those i

will not take thetrouble of practising</s>  it is not that i do not believe my fingers ascapable as any other womans of superior execution</s> darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right</s>  you have employed yourtime much better</s>  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you canthink anything wanting</s>  we neither of us perform to strangers</s> here they were interrupted by lady

would not play at all amiss if she practised more andcould have the advantage of a london master</s>  she has a very good notionof fingering though her taste is not equal to annes</s>  anne would havebeen a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn</s> elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to hiscousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could shediscern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to missde bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might havebeen just as likely to marry her had she been his relation</s> lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixingwith them many instructions on execution and taste</s>  elizabeth receivedthem with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of thegentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage wasready to take them all home</s> chapter 32elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to janewhile mrs</s>  collins and maria were gone on business into the villagewhen she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of avisitor</s>  as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely tobe lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away herhalffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questionswhen the door opened and to her very great surprise mr</s>  darcy andmr</s>  darcy only entered the room</s> he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for hisintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies wereto be within</s> they then sat down and when her inquiries after rosings were madeseemed in danger of sinking into total silence</s>  it was absolutelynecessary therefore to think of something and in this emergencerecollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire andfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hastydeparture she observedhow very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr</s>  darcy</s> it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr</s>  bingley to see youall after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the daybefore</s>  he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london</s> perfectly so i thank you</s> she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a shortpause addedi think i have understood that mr</s>  bingley has not much idea of everreturning to netherfield again</s> i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spendvery little of his time there in the future</s>  he has many friends andis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continuallyincreasing</s> if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better forthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then wemight possibly get a settled family there</s>  but perhaps mr</s>  bingley didnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood asfor his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the sameprinciple</s> i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up assoon as any eligible purchase offers</s> elizabeth made no answer</s>  she was afraid of talking longer of hisfriend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave thetrouble of finding a subject to him</s> he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortablehouse</s>  lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr</s> collins first came to hunsford</s> i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed herkindness on a more grateful object</s> mr</s>  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife</s> yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with oneof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have madehim happy if they had</s>  my friend has an excellent understandingthoughi am not certain that i consider her marrying mr</s>  collins as thewisest thing she ever did</s>  she seems perfectly happy however and in aprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her</s> it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy adistance of her own family and friends</s> an easy distance do you call it</s>  it is nearly fifty miles</s> and what is fifty miles of good road</s>  little more than half a daysjourney</s>  yes i call it a very easy distance</s> i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantagesof the match cried elizabeth</s>  i should never have said mrs</s>  collinswas settled near her family</s> it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire</s>  anything beyondthe very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far</s> as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied sheunderstood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane andnetherfield and she blushed as she answeredi do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near herfamily</s>  the far and the near must be relative and depend on manyvarying circumstances</s>  where there is fortune to make the expenses oftravelling unimportant distance becomes no evil</s>  but that is not thecase here</s>  mr</s>  and mrs</s>  collins have a comfortable income but notsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded myfriend would not call herself near her family under less than halfthe present distance</s> mr</s>  darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannothave a right to such very strong local attachment</s>  you cannot havebeen always at longbourn</s> elizabeth looked surprised</s>  the gentleman experienced some change offeeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table andglancing over it said in a colder voiceare you pleased with kent</s> a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either sidecalm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotteand her sister just returned from her walk</s>  the teteatete surprisedthem</s>  mr</s>  darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intrudingon miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without sayingmuch to anybody went away</s> what can be the meaning of this</s>  said charlotte as soon as he wasgone</s>  my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would neverhave called us in this familiar way</s> but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likelyeven to charlottes wishes to be the case and after variousconjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed fromthe difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probablefrom the time of year</s>  all field sports were over</s>  within doors therewas lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannotalways be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or thepleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it thetwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thitheralmost every day</s>  they called at various times of the morning sometimesseparately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by theiraunt</s>  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because hehad pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommendedhim still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction inbeing with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of herformer favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she sawthere was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams mannersshe believed he might have the best informed mind</s> but why mr</s>  darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficultto understand</s>  it could not be for society as he frequently sat thereten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speakit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrificeto propriety not a pleasure to himself</s>  he seldom appeared reallyanimated</s>  mrs</s>  collins knew not what to make of him</s>  colonelfitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he wasgenerally different which her own knowledge of him could not have toldher and as she would liked to have believed this

much admiration in it and sometimes itseemed nothing but absence of mind</s> she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of hisbeing partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs</s> collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger ofraising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in heropinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike wouldvanish if she could suppose him to be in her power</s> in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marryingcolonel fitzwilliam</s>  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man hecertainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible butto counterbalance these advantages mr</s>  darcy had considerable patronagein the church and his cousin could have none at all</s> chapter 33more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the parkunexpectedly meet mr</s>  darcy</s>  she felt all the perverseness of themischance that should bring him

odd</s>  yet it did and even a third</s>  it seemed likewilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it wasnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then awaybut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her</s>  henever said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talkingor of listening much but it struck her in the course of their thirdrencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabouther pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and heropinion of mr</s>  and mrs</s>  collinss happiness and that in speaking ofrosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed toexpect that whenever she came into kent again she would be stayingthere too</s>  his words seemed to imply it</s>  could he have colonelfitzwilliam in his thoughts</s>  she supposed if he meant anything he mustmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter</s>  it distressedher a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in thepales opposite the parsonage</s> she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letterand dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written

not know before that you ever walked this way</s> i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generallydo every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage</s>  areyou going much farther</s> no i should have turned in a moment</s> and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonagetogether</s> do you certainly leave kent on saturday</s>  said she</s> yesif darcy does not put it off again</s>  but i am at his disposal</s>  hearranges the business just as he pleases</s> and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at leastpleasure in the great power of choice</s>  i do not know anybody who seemsmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr</s>  darcy</s> he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam</s> but so we all do</s>  it is only that he has better means of having itthan many others because he is rich and many others are poor</s>  i speakfeelingly</s>  a younger son you know must be inured to

oftendo</s> our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not manyin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention tomoney</s> is this thought elizabeth meant for me</s>  and she coloured at theidea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray whatis the usual price of an earls younger son</s>  unless the elder brother isvery sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds</s> he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped</s>  to interrupta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passedshe soon afterwards saidi imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake ofhaving someone at his disposal</s>  i wonder he does not marry to secure alasting convenience of that kind</s>  but perhaps his sister does as wellfor the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what helikes with her</s> no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he mustdivide with me</s>  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy</s> are you indeed</s>  and pray what sort of guardians do you make</s>  does yourcharge give you much trouble</s>  young ladies of her age are sometimes alittle difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit shemay like to have her own way</s> as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the mannerin which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely togive them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or othergot pretty near the truth</s>  she directly repliedyou need not be frightened</s>  i never heard any harm of her and i daresay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world</s>  she is avery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs</s>  hurst

elizabeth drily mr</s>  darcy is uncommonly kind to mr</s> bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him</s> care of him</s>  yes i really believe darcy does take care of him inthose points where he most wants care</s>  from something that he told me inour journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted tohim</s>  but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose thatbingley was the person meant</s>  it was all conjecture</s>
it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally knownbecause if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be anunpleasant thing</s> you may depend upon my not mentioning it</s> and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to bebingley</s>  what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himselfon having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a mostimprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any otherparticulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believinghim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and fromknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer</s> did mr</s>  darcy give you reasons for this interference</s> i understood that there were some very strong objections against thelady</s> and what arts did he use to separate them</s> he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling</s>  heonly told me what i have now told you</s> elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling withindignation</s>  after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why shewas so thoughtful</s> i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she</s>  yourcousins conduct does not suit my feelings</s>  why was he to be the judge</s> you are rather disposed to call his interference officious</s> i do not see what right mr</s>  darcy had to decide on the propriety of hisfriends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was todetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy</s> but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of theparticulars it is not fair to condemn him</s>  it is not to be supposedthat there was much affection in the case</s> that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is alessening of the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly</s> this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a pictureof mr</s>  darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer andtherefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferentmatters until they reached the parsonage</s>  there shut into her own roomas soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruptionof all that she had heard</s>  it was not to be supposed that any otherpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected</s>  therecould not exist in the world two men over whom mr</s>  darcy could havesuch boundless influence</s>  that he had been concerned in the measurestaken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she hadalways attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangementof them</s>  if his own vanity however did not mislead him he wasthe cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane hadsuffered and still continued to suffer</s>  he had ruined for a whileevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in theworld and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted</s> there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonelfitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were herhaving one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was inbusiness in london</s> to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility ofobjection all loveliness and goodness as she is</s> her understandingexcellent her mind improved and her manners

reach</s>  when she thought ofher mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allowthat any objections there had material weight with mr</s>  darcy whosepride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want ofimportance in his friends connections than from their want of senseand she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governedby this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr</s> bingley for his sister</s> the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on aheadache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added toher unwillingness to see mr</s>  darcy it determined her not to attend hercousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea</s>  mrs</s>  collinsseeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as muchas possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr</s>  collinscould not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being ratherdispleased by her staying at home</s> chapter 34when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herselfas much as possible against mr</s>  darcy chose for her employment theexamination of all the letters which jane had written to her since herbeing in kent</s>  they contained no actual complaint nor was there anyrevival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering</s> but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of thatcheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and whichproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindlydisposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded</s>  elizabethnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with anattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal</s>  mr</s>  darcysshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave hera keener sense of her sisters sufferings</s>  it was some consolationto think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after thenextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she shouldherself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery ofher spirits by all that affection could do</s> she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering thathis cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clearthat he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did notmean to be unhappy about him</s> while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of thedoorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of itsbeing colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late inthe evening and might now come to inquire particularly after her</s> but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differentlyaffected when to her utter amazement she saw mr</s>  darcy walk into theroom</s>  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after herhealth imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better</s> she answered him with cold civility</s>  he sat down for a few moments andthen getting up walked about the room</s>  elizabeth was surprised butsaid not a word</s>  after a silence of several minutes he came towards herin an agitated manner and thus beganin vain i have struggled</s>  it will not do</s>  my feelings will not berepressed</s>  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and loveyou</s> elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression</s>  she stared coloureddoubted and was silent</s>  this he considered sufficient encouragementand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for herimmediately followed</s>  he spoke well but there were feelings besidesthose of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on thesubject of tenderness than of pride</s>  his sense of her inferiorityofits being a degradationof the family obstacles which had alwaysopposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due tothe consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend hissuit</s> in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible tothe compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions didnot vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was toreceive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language shelost all compassion in anger</s>  she tried however to compose herself toanswer him with patience when he should have done</s>  he concluded withrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spiteof all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and withexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance ofhis hand</s>  as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubtof a favourable answer</s>  he spoke of apprehension and anxiety buthis countenance expressed real security</s>  such a circumstance couldonly exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into hercheeks and she saidin such cases as this it is i believe the established mode toexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed howeverunequally they may be returned</s>  it is natural that obligation shouldbe felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you</s>  but icannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainlybestowed it most unwillingly</s>  i am sorry to have occasioned pain toanyone</s>  it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will beof short duration</s>  the feelings which you tell me have long preventedthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty inovercoming it after this explanation</s> mr</s>  darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixedon her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment thansurprise</s>  his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbanceof his mind was visible in every feature</s>  he was struggling for theappearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believedhimself to have attained it</s>  the pause was to elizabeths feelingsdreadful</s>  at length with a voice of forced calmness he saidand this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting</s> i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour atcivility i am thus rejected</s>  but it is of small importance</s> i might as well inquire replied she why with so evident a desireof offending and insulting me you chose to tell

have</s>  had not my feelings decided againstyouhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do youthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who hasbeen the means of

her while shecontinuedi have every reason in the world to think ill of you</s>  no motive canexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there</s>  you dare notyou cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only meansof dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of theworld for caprice and instability and the other to its derision fordisappointed hopes and

even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity</s> can you deny that you have done it</s>  she repeated</s> with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denyingthat i did everything in my power to separate my friend from yoursister or that i rejoice in my success</s>  towards him i have beenkinder than towards myself</s> elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing

estimation in which you hold me</s> i thank you for explaining it so fully</s>  my faults according to thiscalculation are heavy indeed</s>  but perhaps added he stopping inhis walk and turning towards her these offenses might have beenoverlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of thescruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design</s>  thesebitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greaterpolicy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief ofmy being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason byreflection

have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a moregentlemanlike manner</s> she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continuedyou could not have made the offer of your hand in any

up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad</s>  thepark paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed oneof the gates into the ground</s> after walking two or three times

repetition of those sentiments or renewal of thoseoffers which were last night so disgusting to you</s>  i write without anyintention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wisheswhich for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and theeffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasionshould have been spared had not my character required it to be writtenand read</s>  you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demandyour attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but idemand it of your justice</s> two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equalmagnitude you last night laid to my charge</s>  the first mentioned wasthat regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr</s>  bingleyfrom your sister and the other that i had in defiance of variousclaims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediateprosperity and blasted the prospects of mr</s>  wickham</s>  wilfully andwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledgedfavourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any otherdependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expectits exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two youngpersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks couldbear no comparison</s>  but from the severity of that blame which was lastnight so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hopeto be in the future secured when the following account of my actionsand their motives has been read</s>  if in the explanation of them whichis due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings whichmay be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry</s>  the necessitymust be obeyed and further apology would be absurd</s> i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common withothers that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other youngwoman in the country</s>  but it was not till the evening of the danceat netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a seriousattachment</s>  i had often seen him in love before</s>  at that ball while ihad the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sirwilliam lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions toyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage</s> he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone couldbe undecided</s>  from that moment i observed my friends behaviourattentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for missbennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him</s>  your sister i alsowatched</s>  her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as everbut without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convincedfrom the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentionswith pleasure she did not invite them by any participation ofsentiment</s>  if you have not been mistaken here i must have beenin error</s>  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latterprobable</s>  if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflictpain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable</s>  but i shall notscruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance andair was such as might have given the most acute observer a convictionthat however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to beeasily touched</s>  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent iscertainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisionsare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears</s>  i did not believeher to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartialconviction as truly as i wished it in reason</s>  my objections to themarriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to havethe utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want ofconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me</s>  butthere were other causes of repugnance causes which though stillexisting and existing to an equal degree in both instances i hadmyself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately beforeme</s>  these causes must be stated though briefly</s>  the situation of yourmothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to thattotal want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed byherself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by yourfather</s>  pardon me</s>  it pains me to offend you</s>  but amidst your concernfor the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at thisrepresentation of them let it give you consolation to consider that tohave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censureis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister thanit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both</s>  i will only sayfarther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all partieswas confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have ledme before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappyconnection</s>  he left netherfield for london on the day following asyou i am certain remember with the design of soon returning</s> the part which i acted is now to be explained</s>  his sisters uneasinesshad been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling wassoon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost indetaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly inlondon</s>  we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the officeof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice</s>  idescribed and enforced them earnestly</s>  but however this remonstrancemight have staggered or delayed his determination i do not supposethat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not beenseconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of yoursisters indifference</s>  he had before believed her to return hisaffection with sincere if not with equal regard</s>  but bingley has greatnatural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on hisown</s>  to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself wasno very difficult point</s>  to persuade him against returning intohertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely thework of a moment</s>  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much</s>  thereis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do notreflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt themeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being intown</s>  i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but herbrother is even yet ignorant of it</s>  that they might have met withoutill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to meenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger</s>  perhaps thisconcealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and itwas done for the best</s>  on this subject i have nothing more to say noother apology to offer</s>  if i have wounded your sisters feelings itwas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may toyou very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemnthem</s> with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injuredmr</s>  wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of hisconnection with my family</s>  of what he has particularly accused me iam ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon morethan one witness of undoubted veracity</s> mr</s>  wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for manyyears the management of all the pemberley estates and whose goodconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father tobe of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson hiskindness was therefore liberally bestowed</s>  my father supported him atschool and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as hisown father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would havebeen unable to give him a gentlemans education</s>  my father was not onlyfond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging hehad also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would behis profession intended to provide for him in it</s>  as for myself it ismany many years since i first began to think of him in a very differentmanner</s>  the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he wascareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escapethe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himselfand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr</s> darcy could not have</s>  here again i shall give you painto what degreeyou only can tell</s>  but whatever may be the sentiments which mr</s>  wickhamhas created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me fromunfolding his real characterit adds even another motive</s> my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment tomr</s>  wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularlyrecommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best mannerthat his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that avaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant</s>  therewas also a legacy of one thousand pounds</s>  his own father did not longsurvive mine and within half a year from these events mr</s>  wickhamwrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking ordershe hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some moreimmediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which hecould not be benefited</s>  he had some intention he added of studyinglaw and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds wouldbe a very insufficient support therein</s>  i rather wished than believedhim to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede tohis proposal</s>  i knew that mr</s>  wickham ought not to be a clergyman thebusiness was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistancein the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation toreceive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds</s>  all connectionbetween us seemed now dissolved</s>  i thought too ill of him to invite himto pemberley or admit his society in town</s>  in town i believe he chieflylived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now freefrom all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation</s> for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of theincumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied tome again by letter for the presentation</s>  his circumstances he assuredme and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad</s>  hehad found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutelyresolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living inquestionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he waswell assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could nothave forgotten my revered fathers intentions</s>  you will hardly blameme for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting everyrepetition to it</s>  his resentment was in proportion to the distress ofhis circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of meto others as in his reproaches to myself</s>  after this period everyappearance of acquaintance was dropped</s>  how he lived i know not</s>  butlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice</s> i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myselfand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfoldto any human being</s>  having said thus much i feel no doubt of yoursecrecy</s>
 my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left tothe guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself</s> about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formedfor her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presidedover it to ramsgate and thither also went mr</s>  wickham undoubtedly bydesign for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between himand mrs</s>
 younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived andby her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgianawhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness toher as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love andto consent to an elopement</s>  she was then but fifteen which must be herexcuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owedthe knowledge of it to herself</s>  i joined them unexpectedly a day or twobefore the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support theidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to asa father acknowledged the whole to me</s>  you may imagine what i felt andhow i acted</s>  regard for my sisters credit and feelings preventedany public exposure but i wrote to mr</s>  wickham who left the placeimmediately and mrs</s>  younge was of course removed from her charge</s>  mr</s> wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune whichis thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope ofrevenging himself on me was a strong inducement</s>  his revenge would havebeen complete indeed</s> this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we havebeen concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it asfalse you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr</s> wickham</s>  i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood hehad imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wonderedat</s>  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning eitherdetection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not inyour inclination</s> you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night buti was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought tobe revealed</s>  for the truth of everything here related i can appeal moreparticularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from ournear relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one ofthe executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquaintedwith every particular of these transactions</s>  if your abhorrence of meshould make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented bythe same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may bethe possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find someopportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of themorning</s>  i will only add god bless you</s> fitzwilliam darcychapter 36if elizabeth when mr</s>  darcy gave her the letter did not expect it tocontain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all ofits contents</s>  but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerlyshe went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited</s> her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined</s>  with amazement didshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his powerand steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanationto give which a just sense of shame would not conceal</s>  with a strongprejudice against everything he might say she began his account of whathad happened at netherfield</s>  she read with an eagerness which hardlyleft her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what thenext sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense ofthe one before her eyes</s>  his belief of her sisters insensibility sheinstantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worstobjections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doinghim justice</s>  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfiedher his style was not penitent but haughty</s>  it was all pride andinsolence</s> but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr</s>  wickhamwhenshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events whichif true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and whichbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfherfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition</s> astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her</s>  she wishedto discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false</s> this cannot be</s>  this must be the grossest falsehood</s> and when she hadgone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of thelast page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would notregard it that she would never look in it again</s> in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest onnothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letterwas unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could sheagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham andcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence</s> the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly whathe had related himself and the kindness of the late mr</s>  darcy thoughshe had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his ownwords</s>  so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to thewill the difference was great</s>  what wickham had said of the livingwas fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it wasimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or theother and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes didnot err</s>  but when she read and reread with the closest attention theparticulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensionsto the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as threethousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate</s>  she put downthe letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to beimpartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut withlittle success</s>  on both sides it was only assertion</s>  again she readon but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she hadbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as torender mr</s>  darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of aturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole</s> the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay atmr</s>  wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she couldbring no proof of its injustice</s>  she had never heard of him before hisentrance into the shire militia in which

recollection befriended her</s>  she could see him instantly beforeher in every charm of air and address but she could remember no moresubstantial good than the general approbation of the

followed of his designs on missdarcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonelfitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she wasreferred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliamhimselffrom whom she had previously received the information of hisnear concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had noreason to question</s>  at one time she had almost resolved on applying tohim but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application andat length wholly banished by the conviction that mr</s>  darcy would neverhave hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of hiscousins corroboration</s> she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversationbetween wickham and herself in their first evening at mr</s>  phillipss</s> many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory</s>  she was nowstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger andwondered it had escaped her before</s>  she saw the indelicacy of puttinghimself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professionswith his conduct</s>  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fearof seeing mr</s>  darcythat mr</s>  darcy might leave the country but thathe should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ballthe very next week</s>  she remembered also that till the netherfieldfamily had quitted the country he had told his story to no one butherself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussedthat he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr</s>

by a situation of such double danger as awateringplace and a camp</s>  upon the whole therefore she found whathas been sometimes found before that an event to which she had beenlooking with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all thesatisfaction she had promised herself</s>  it was consequently necessary toname some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto havesome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and byagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for thepresent and prepare for another disappointment</s>  her tour to the lakeswas now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolationfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her motherand kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in

but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in mysisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations ofpleasure realised</s>  a scheme of which every part promises delight cannever be successful and general disappointment is only warded off bythe defence of some little peculiar vexation</s> when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutelyto her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected andalways very short</s>  those to her mother contained little else than thatthey were just returned from the library where such and such officershad attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments asmade her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol whichshe would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in aviolent hurry as mrs</s>  forster called her and they were going off tothe camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was stillless to be learntfor her letters to

at longbourn</s>  everything worea happier aspect</s>  the families who had been in town for the winter cameback again and summer finery and summer engagements arose</s>  mrs</s>  bennetwas restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle ofjune kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton withouttears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that bythe following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not tomention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and maliciousarrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered inmeryton</s> the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fastapproaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letterarrived from mrs</s>  gardiner which at once delayed its commencement andcurtailed its extent</s>  mr</s>  gardiner would be prevented by business fromsetting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london againwithin a month and as that left too short a period for them to go sofar and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it withthe leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give upthe lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to thepresent plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire</s>  in thatcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their threeweeks and to mrs</s>  gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction</s>  thetown where she had formerly passed some years of her life and wherethey were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object ofher curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworthdovedale or the peak</s> elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeingthe lakes and still thought there might have been time enough</s>  but itwas her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happyand all was soon right again</s> with the mention of derbyshire there were many

gardiner with their four children did at length appear atlongbourn</s>  the children two girls of six and eight years old and twoyounger boys were to be left under the particular care of theircousin

 it was notin their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it</s>  intalking over their route the evening before mrs</s>  gardiner expressedan inclination to see the place again</s>  mr</s>  gardiner declared hiswillingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation</s> my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heardso much</s>  said her aunt a place too with which so many of youracquaintances are connected</s>  wickham passed all his youth there youknow</s> elizabeth was distressed</s>  she felt that she had no business atpemberley and was obliged to

gardiner abused her stupidity</s>  if it were merely a fine houserichly furnished said she i should not care about it myself butthe grounds are delightful</s>  they have some of the finest woods in

at the very idea andthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run sucha risk</s>  but against this there were objections and she finally resolvedthat it could be the last resource if her private inquiries to theabsence of the family were unfavourably answered</s> accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaidwhether pemberley were not a very fine place</s>  what was the name of itsproprietor</s>  and with no little alarm whether the family were down forthe summer</s>  a most welcome negative followed the last questionand heralarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal ofcuriosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived thenext morning and she was again applied to could readily answer andwith a proper air of indifference that she had not really any disliketo the scheme</s>  to pemberley therefore they were to go</s>
the park was very large and contained great variety of ground</s>  theyentered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time througha beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent</s> elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admiredevery remarkable spot and point of view</s>  they gradually ascended forhalfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerableeminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught bypemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into whichthe road with some abruptness wound</s>  it was a large handsome stonebuilding standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge ofhigh woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance wasswelled into greater but without any artificial appearance</s>
 its bankswere neither formal nor falsely adorned</s>  elizabeth was delighted</s>  shehad never seen a place for which nature had done more or where naturalbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste</s>  they wereall of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt thatto be mistress of pemberley might be something</s> they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door andwhile examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension ofmeeting its owner returned</s>  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had beenmistaken</s>  on applying to see the place they were admitted into thehall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure towonder at her being where she was</s> the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much lessfine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her</s>  theyfollowed her into the diningparlour</s>  it was a large well proportionedroom handsomely fitted up</s>  elizabeth after slightly surveying it wentto a window to enjoy its prospect</s>  the hill crowned with wood whichthey had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distancewas a beautiful object</s>  every disposition of the ground was good andshe looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on itsbanks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace itwith delight</s>  as they passed into other rooms these objects were takingdifferent positions but from every window there were beauties to beseen</s>  the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable tothe fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration ofhis taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less ofsplendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings</s> and of this place thought she i might have been mistress</s>  withthese rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted</s>  instead ofviewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own andwelcomed to

questionwas asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs</s> reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow witha large party of friends</s>  how rejoiced was elizabeth that their ownjourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day</s> her aunt now called her to look at a picture</s>  she approached and saw thelikeness of mr</s>  wickham suspended amongst several other miniaturesover the mantelpiece</s>  her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it</s> the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a younggentleman the son of her late

smile but elizabeth could notreturn it</s> and that said mrs</s>  reynolds pointing to another of the miniaturesis my masterand very like him</s>  it was drawn at the same time as theotherabout eight

the housekeeper added i havenever known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him eversince he was four years old</s> this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to herideas</s>  that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion</s> her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and wasgrateful to her uncle for sayingthere are very few

fancy it is only because he does not rattle awaylike other young men</s> in what an amiable light does this place him</s>  thought elizabeth</s> this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is notquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend</s> perhaps we might be deceived</s> that is not very likely our authority was too good</s> on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very prettysittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness thanthe apartments below and were informed that it was but just done togive pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room whenlast at pemberley</s> he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towardsone of the windows</s> mrs</s>  reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight

her</s> the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms wereall that remained to be shown</s>  in the former were many good paintingsbut elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been alreadyvisible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of missdarcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting andalso more intelligible</s> in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could havelittle to fix the attention of a stranger</s>  elizabeth walked in quest ofthe only face whose features would be known to her</s>  at last it arrestedherand she beheld a striking resemblance to mr</s>  darcy with such asmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when helooked at her</s>  she stood several minutes before the picture in earnestcontemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery</s> mrs</s>  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fatherslifetime</s> there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentlesensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height oftheir acquaintance</s>  the commendation bestowed on him by mrs</s>  reynoldswas of no trifling nature</s>  what praise is more valuable than the praiseof an intelligent servant</s>  as a brother a landlord a master sheconsidered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship</s> howmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow</s> how much ofgood or evil must be done by him</s>  every idea that had been broughtforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as shestood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed hiseyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment ofgratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth andsoftened its impropriety of expression</s> when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seenthey returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper wereconsigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor</s> as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned backto look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the formerwas conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himselfsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables</s> they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was hisappearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight</s>  their eyesinstantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepestblush</s>  he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable fromsurprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the partyand spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at leastof perfect civility</s> she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approachreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to beovercome</s>  had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picturethey had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other twothat they now saw mr</s>  darcy the gardeners expression of surprise onbeholding his master must immediately have told it</s>  they stood a littlealoof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confusedscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answershe returned to his civil inquiries after her family</s>  amazed at thealteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence thathe uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of theimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the fewminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable inher life</s>  nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accenthad none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his inquiries asto the time of her having left longbourn and of her having stayed inderbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke thedistraction of his thoughts</s> at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a fewmoments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and tookleave</s> the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure

it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alightedfrom his horse or his carriage</s>  she blushed again and again overthe perverseness of the meeting</s>  and his behaviour so strikinglyalteredwhat could it mean</s>  that he should even speak to her wasamazing</s> but to speak with such civility to inquire after her family</s> never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified neverhad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting</s>  whata contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he puthis letter into her hand</s>  she knew not what to think or how to accountfor it</s> they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water andevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finerreach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some timebefore elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answeredmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt andseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out shedistinguished no part of the scene</s>  her thoughts were all fixed on thatone spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr</s>  darcy thenwas</s>  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindinwhat manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everythingshe was still dear to him</s>  perhaps he had been civil only because hefelt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which wasnot like ease</s>  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure inseeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her withcomposure</s> at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mindaroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself</s> they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a whileascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening ofthe trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of thevalley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreadingmany and occasionally part of the stream</s>  mr</s>  gardiner expressed a wishof going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk</s> with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round</s> it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit whichbrought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woodsto the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts</s>  they crossedit by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the sceneit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and thevalley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the streamand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it</s> elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed thebridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs</s>  gardinerwho was not a great walker could go no farther and thought onlyof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible</s>  her niece wastherefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the houseon the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but theirprogress was slow for mr</s>  gardiner though seldom able to indulge thetaste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching theoccasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to theman about them that he advanced but little</s>  whilst wandering on in thisslow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishmentwas quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr</s>  darcyapproaching them and at no great distance</s>  the walk being hereless sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him beforethey met</s>  elizabeth however astonished was at least more preparedfor an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak withcalmness if he really intended to meet them</s>  for a few moments indeedshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path</s>  the idealasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view theturning past he was immediately before them</s>  with a glance she sawthat he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate hispoliteness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the placebut she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming whensome unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise ofpemberley from her might be mischievously construed</s>  her colour changedand she said no more</s> mrs</s>  gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he askedher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends</s> this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unpreparedand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking theacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride hadrevolted in his offer to herself</s>  what will be his surprise thoughtshe when he knows who they are</s>  he takes them now for people offashion</s> the introduction however was immediately made and as she named theirrelationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he boreit and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as hecould from such disgraceful companions</s>  that he was surprised by theconnection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude andso far from going away turned back with them and entered intoconversation with mr</s>  gardiner</s>  elizabeth could not but be pleasedcould not but triumph</s>  it was consoling that he should know she hadsome relations for whom there was no need to blush</s>  she listened mostattentively to all that passed between them and gloried in everyexpression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligencehis taste or his good manners</s> the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr</s>  darcyinvite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as hechose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same timeto supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts ofthe stream where there was usually most sport</s>  mrs</s>  gardiner who waswalking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder</s> elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the complimentmust be all for herself</s>  her astonishment however was extreme andcontinually was she repeating why is he so altered</s>  from what canit proceed</s>  it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that hismanners are thus softened</s>  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such achange as this</s>  it is impossible that he should still love me</s> after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the twogentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending tothe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curiouswaterplant there chanced to be a little alteration</s>  it originatedin mrs</s>  gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning foundelizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferredher husbands</s>  mr</s>  darcy took her place by her niece and they walked ontogether</s>  after a short silence the lady first spoke</s>  she wished himto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to theplace and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had beenvery unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us thatyou would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before weleft bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expectedin the country</s>  he acknowledged the truth of it all and said thatbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hoursbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling</s>  theywill join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are somewho will claim an acquaintance with youmr</s>  bingley and his sisters</s> elizabeth answered only by a slight bow</s>  her thoughts were instantlydriven back to the time when mr</s>  bingleys name had been the lastmentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion hismind was not very differently engaged</s> there is also one other person in the party he continued after apause who more particularly wishes to be known to you</s>  will you allowme or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintanceduring your stay at lambton</s> the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too greatfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it</s>  she immediately feltthat whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with hermust be the work of her brother and without looking farther it wassatisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not madehim think really ill of her</s> they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought</s>  elizabethwas not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered andpleased</s>  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment ofthe highest kind</s>  they soon outstripped the others and when they hadreached the carriage mr</s>  and mrs</s>  gardiner were half a quarter of amile behind</s> he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself nottired and they stood together on the lawn</s>  at such a time much mighthave been said and silence was very awkward</s>  she wanted to talk butthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject</s>  at last she recollectedthat she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dalewith great perseverance</s>  yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand herpatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the teteatete wasover</s>  on mr</s>  and mrs</s>  gardiners coming up they were all pressed to gointo the house and take some refreshment but this was declined andthey parted on each side with utmost politeness</s>  mr</s>  darcy handed theladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw himwalking slowly towards the house</s> the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of thempronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected</s> he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle</s> there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied heraunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming</s>  i can nowsay with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud ihave seen nothing of it</s> i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us</s>  it was morethan civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for suchattention</s>  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling</s> to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickhamor rather he has not wickhams countenance for his featuresare perfectly good</s>  but how came you to tell me that he was sodisagreeable</s> elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had likedhim better when they had met in kent than before and that she had neverseen him so pleasant as this morning</s> but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities repliedher uncle</s>  your great men often are and therefore i shall not take himat his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me offhis grounds</s> elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character butsaid nothing</s> from what we have seen of him continued mrs</s>  gardiner i reallyshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way byanybody as he has done by poor wickham</s>  he has not an illnatured look</s> on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when hespeaks</s>  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that wouldnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart</s>  but to be sure thegood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character</s> i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes</s>  but he is a liberalmaster i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends everyvirtue</s> elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication ofhis behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand inas guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard fromhis relations in kent his actions were capable of a very differentconstruction and that his character was by no means so faulty norwickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire</s>  inconfirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniarytransactions in which they had been connected without actually namingher authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on</s> mrs</s>  gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were nowapproaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way tothe charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing outto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think ofanything else</s>  fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk theyhad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her formeracquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of aintercourse renewed after many years discontinuance</s> the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabethmuch attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothingbut think and think with wonder of mr</s>  darcys civility and aboveall of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister</s> chapter 44elizabeth had settled it that mr</s>  darcy would bring his sister to visither the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequentlyresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning</s> but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after theirarrival at lambton these visitors came</s>  they had been walking about theplace with some of their new friends and were just returning to the innto dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of acarriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady ina curricle driving up the street</s>  elizabeth immediately recognizingthe livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of hersurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which sheexpected</s>  her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassmentof her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and manyof the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea onthe business</s>  nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt thatthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such aquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece</s>  while thesenewlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation ofelizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing</s>  she was quiteamazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquietshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too muchin her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturallysuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her</s> she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walkedup and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks ofinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse</s> miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introductiontook place</s>  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her newacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself</s>  since herbeing at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proudbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she wasonly exceedingly shy</s>  she found it difficult to obtain even a word fromher beyond a monosyllable</s> miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and thoughlittle more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearancewomanly and graceful</s>  she was less handsome than her brother but therewas sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectlyunassuming and gentle</s>  elizabeth who had expected to find in her asacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr</s>  darcy had been was

between the aunt and the niece thatsuch a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on thevery day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to alate breakfast ought to be

bingley known whatpain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly wouldhave refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discomposeelizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man

certainly formed such a plan and withoutmeaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from missbennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concernfor the welfare of

miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was notthe best method of recommending herself but angry people are not alwayswise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all

yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believehim capable of it</s> not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every otherneglect i can believe him capable</s>  if indeed it should be so</s>  but idare not hope it</s>  why should they not go on to scotland if that had beenthe case</s> in the first place replied mr</s>  gardiner there is no absolute proofthat they are not gone to scotland</s> oh</s>  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is sucha presumption</s>  and besides no traces of them were to be found on thebarnet road</s> well thensupposing them to be in london</s>  they may be there thoughfor the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose</s>  it isnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side and itmight strike them that they could be more economically though lessexpeditiously married in london than in scotland</s> but why all this secrecy</s>  why any fear of detection</s>  why must theirmarriage be private</s>  oh no nothis is not likely</s>  his most particularfriend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intendingto marry her</s>  wickham will never marry a woman without some money</s>  hecannot afford it</s>  and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has shebeyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sakeforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well</s>  as to whatrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on adishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i knownothing of the effects that such a step might produce</s>  but as to yourother objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good</s>  lydia hasno brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathersbehaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has everseemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he woulddo as little and think as little about it as any father could do insuch a matter</s> but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of himas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage</s> it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth withtears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in sucha point should admit of doubt</s>  but really i know not what to say</s> perhaps i am not doing her justice</s>  but she is very young she has neverbeen taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyearnay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusementand vanity</s>  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idleand frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way</s> since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but loveflirtation and officers have been in her head</s>  she has been doingeverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to givegreaterwhat shall i call it</s>  susceptibility to her feelings which arenaturally lively enough</s>  and we all know that wickham has every charm ofperson and address that can captivate a woman</s> but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so very ill ofwickham as to believe him capable of the attempt</s> of whom does jane ever think ill</s>  and who is there whatever might betheir former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempttill it were proved against them</s>  but jane knows as well as i do whatwickham really is</s>  we both know that he has been profligate in everysense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he isas false and deceitful as he is insinuating</s> and do you really know all this</s>  cried mrs</s>  gardiner whose curiosityas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive</s> i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring</s>  i told you the other dayof his infamous behaviour to mr</s>  darcy and you yourself when last atlongbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behavedwith such forbearance and liberality towards him</s>  and there are othercircumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while torelate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless</s>  fromwhat he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proudreserved disagreeable girl</s>  yet he knew to the contrary himself</s>  hemust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have foundher</s> but does lydia know nothing of this</s>  can she be ignorant of what youand jane seem so well to understand</s> oh yes</s> that that is the worst of all</s>  till i was in kent and sawso much both of mr</s>  darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i wasignorant of the truth myself</s>  and when i returned home the shirewas to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time</s>  as that was thecase neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought itnecessary to make our knowledge public for of what use couldit apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all theneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown</s>  and even when it wassettled that lydia should go with mrs</s>  forster the necessity of openingher eyes to his character never occurred to me</s>  that she could bein any danger from the deception never entered my head</s>  that such aconsequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was farenough from my thoughts</s> when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason isuppose to believe them fond of each other</s> not the slightest</s>  i can remember no symptom of affection on eitherside and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be awarethat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away</s>  when firsthe entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we allwere</s>  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him forthe first two months but he never distinguished her by any particularattention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant andwild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regimentwho treated her with more distinction again became her favourites</s>          it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be addedto their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject byits repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long duringthe whole of the journey</s>  from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent</s> fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could findno interval of ease or forgetfulness</s> they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one nighton the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day</s>  it was acomfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been weariedby long expectations</s> the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standingon the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when thecarriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up theirfaces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety ofcapers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome</s> elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kisshurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down from hermothers apartment immediately met her</s> elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled theeyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether anything had beenheard of the fugitives</s> not yet replied jane</s>  but now that my dear uncle is come i hopeeverything will be well</s> is my father in town</s> yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word</s> and have you heard from him often</s> we have heard only twice</s>  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to saythat he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which iparticularly begged him to do</s>  he merely added that he should not writeagain till he had something of importance to mention</s> and my motherhow is she</s>  how are you all</s> my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatlyshaken</s>  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing youall</s>  she does not yet leave her dressingroom</s>  mary and kitty thankheaven are quite well</s> but youhow are you</s>  cried elizabeth</s>  you look pale</s>  how much youmust have gone through</s> her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and theirconversation which had been passing while mr</s>  and mrs</s>  gardiner wereengaged with their children was now put an end to by the approachof the whole party</s>  jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed andthanked them both with alternate smiles and tears</s> when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabethhad already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soonfound that jane had no intelligence to give</s>  the sanguine hope ofgood however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yetdeserted her she still expected that it would all end well and thatevery morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her fatherto explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage</s> mrs</s>  bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutesconversation together received them exactly as might be expected withtears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainousconduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusageblaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence theerrors of her daughter must principally be owing</s> if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brightonwith all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydiahad nobody to take care of her</s>  why did the forsters ever let her go outof their sight</s>  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on theirside for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had beenwell looked after</s>  i always thought they were very unfit to have thecharge of her but i was overruled as i always am</s>  poor dear child</s> and now heres mr</s>  bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickhamwherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to becomeof us all</s>  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in hisgrave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what weshall do</s> they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr</s>  gardiner aftergeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family told herthat he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr</s> bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia</s> do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to beprepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain</s> it is not quite a week since they left brighton</s>  in a few days more wemay gain some news of them and till we know that they are not marriedand have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over aslost</s>  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and makehim come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consulttogether as to what is to be done</s> oh</s>  my dear brother replied mrs</s>  bennet that is exactly what icould most wish for</s>  and now do when you get to town find them outwherever they may be and if they are not married already make themmarry</s>  and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that buttell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy themafter they are married</s>  and above all keep mr</s>  bennet from fighting</s> tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of mywitsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuchspasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart thati can get no rest by night nor by day</s>  and tell my dear lydia not togive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she doesnot know which are the best warehouses</s>  oh brother how kind you are</s>  iknow you will contrive it all</s> but mr</s>  gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavoursin the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as wellin her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner tilldinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings onthe housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters</s> though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no realoccasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt tooppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold hertongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged itbetter that one only of the household and the one whom they couldmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on thesubject</s> in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had beentoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearancebefore</s>  one came from her books and the other from her toilette</s>  thefaces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visiblein either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the angerwhich she had herself incurred in this business had given more offretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty</s>  as for mary she wasmistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenanceof grave reflection soon after they were seated at tablethis is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of</s> but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms ofeach other the balm of sisterly consolation</s> then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she addedunhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this usefullesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that onefalse step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no lessbrittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded inher behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex</s> elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressedto make any reply</s>  mary however continued to console herself with suchkind of moral extractions from the evil before them</s> in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be forhalfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself ofthe opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager tosatisfy</s>  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequelof this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and missbennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continuedthe subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it whichi have not already heard</s>  give me further particulars</s>  what did colonelforster say</s>  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopementtook place</s>  they must have seen them together for ever</s> colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partialityespecially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm</s>  i am sogrieved for him</s>  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost</s>  hewas coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he hadany idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehensionfirst got abroad it hastened his journey</s> and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry</s>  did he know oftheir intending to go off</s>  had colonel forster seen denny himself</s> yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything oftheir plans and would not give his real opinion about it</s>  he did notrepeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i aminclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before</s> and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained adoubt i suppose of their being really married</s> how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains</s>  i felta little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with himin marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quiteright</s>  my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt howimprudent a match it must be</s>  kitty then owned with a very naturaltriumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last lettershe had prepared her for such a step</s>  she had known it seems of theirbeing in love with each other many weeks</s> but not before they went to brighton</s> no i believe not</s> and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself</s>  doeshe know his real character</s> i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerlydid</s>  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant</s>  and since this sadaffair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debtbut i hope this may be false</s> oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of himthis could not have happened</s> perhaps it would have been better replied her sister</s>  but to exposethe former faults of any person without knowing what their presentfeelings were seemed unjustifiable</s>  we acted with the best intentions</s> could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to hiswife</s> he

assistance is impossible condolenceinsufferable</s>  let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied</s> she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father hadintended to pursue

nextmorning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him</s> his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent anddilatory correspondent but at such a time they had

letters before he set off</s> when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constantinformation of what was going on and their uncle promised at partingto prevail on mr</s>  bennet to

though she did not credit abovehalf of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance ofher sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still lessof it became almost hopeless more

longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received aletter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediatelyfound out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch streetthat mr</s>  bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrivalbut without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was nowdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr</s>

in her power to give any informationof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved</s>  she had neverheard of his having had any relations except a father and mother bothof whom had been dead

heard again from mr</s>  gardiner a letter arrived fortheir father from a different quarter from mr</s>  collins which as janehad received directions to open all that came for him in his absenceshe accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities hisletters always were looked over her and read it likewise</s>  it was asfollowsmy dear siri feel myself called upon by our relationship and

death of your daughter wouldhave been a blessing in comparison of this</s>  and it is the more tobe lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotteinforms me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter hasproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same timefor the consolation of yourself and mrs</s>  bennet i am inclined to thinkthat her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not beguilty of such an enormity at so early an age</s>  howsoever that may beyou are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joinedby mrs</s>  collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter towhom i have related the affair</s>  they agree with me in apprehending thatthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes

where she was</s>  she caredfor none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hearof leaving wickham</s>  she was sure they should be married some time orother and it did not much signify when</s>  since such were her feelingsit only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage whichin his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had neverbeen his design</s>  he confessed himself obliged to leave the regimenton account of some debts of honour which were very pressing andscrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on herown folly alone</s>  he meant to resign his commission immediately and asto his future situation he could conjecture very little about it</s>  hemust go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should havenothing to live on</s> mr</s>  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once</s>  thoughmr</s>  bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been ableto do something for him and his situation must have been benefited bymarriage</s>  but he found in reply to this question that wickham stillcherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage insome other country</s>  under such circumstances however he was not likelyto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief</s> they met several times for there was much to be discussed</s>  wickham ofcourse wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to bereasonable</s> every thing being settled between them mr</s>  darcys next step was tomake your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home</s>  but mr</s>  gardiner could not beseen and mr</s>  darcy found on further inquiry that your father wasstill with him but would quit town the next morning</s>  he did not judgeyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as youruncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after thedeparture of the former</s>  he did not leave his name and till the nextday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business</s> on saturday he came again</s>  your father was gone your uncle at homeand as i said before they had a great deal of talk together</s> they met again on sunday and then i saw him too</s>  it was not allsettled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off tolongbourn</s>  but our visitor was very obstinate</s>  i fancy lizzy thatobstinacy is the real defect of his character after all</s>  he has beenaccused of many faults at different times but this is the true one</s> nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure andi do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it youruncle would most readily have settled the whole</s> they battled it together for a long time which was more than eitherthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved</s>  but at last your unclewas forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to hisniece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of itwhich went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letterthis morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanationthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise whereit was due</s>  but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or janeat most</s> you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the youngpeople</s>  his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerablymore than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her ownsettled upon her and his commission purchased</s>  the reason why allthis was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above</s>  itwas owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration thatwickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that hehad been received and noticed as he was</s>  perhaps there was some truthin this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reservecan be answerable for the event</s>  but in spite of all this fine talkingmy dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle wouldnever have yielded if we had not given him credit for anotherinterest in the affair</s> when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends whowere still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be inlondon once more when the wedding took place and all money matters werethen to receive the last finish</s> i believe i have now told you every thing</s>  it is a relation whichyou tell me is to give you great surprise i hope

tell you how little i wassatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had notperceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on cominghome was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tellyou can give you no fresh pain</s>  i talked to her repeatedly in the mostserious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she haddone and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family</s>  if sheheard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen</s>  i wassometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth andjane and for their sakes had patience with her</s> mr</s>  darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed youattended the wedding</s>  he dined with us the next day and was to leavetown again on wednesday or thursday</s>  will you be very angry with me mydear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never boldenough to say before how much i like him</s>  his behaviour to us hasin every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire</s>  hisunderstanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a littlemore liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may

uncomfortableenough</s>  each felt for the other and of course for themselves and theirmother talked on of her dislike of mr</s>  darcy and her resolution to becivil to him only as mr</s>  bingleys

to relate her own change of sentiment towards him</s> to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refusedand whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensiveinformation he was the person to whom the whole family were indebtedfor the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with aninterest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just aswhat jane felt for bingley</s>  her astonishment at his comingat hiscoming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her againwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his alteredbehaviour in

that his affection andwishes must still be unshaken</s>  but she would not be secure</s> let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be earlyenough for expectation</s> she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring tolift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face ofher sister as the servant was approaching the door</s>  jane looked a littlepaler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected</s>  on thegentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them withtolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from

misfortune</s> chapter 56one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had beenformed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in thediningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by thesound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving upthe lawn</s>  it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides theequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours</s>  the horseswere post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant whopreceded it were familiar to them</s>  as it was certain however thatsomebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoidthe confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into theshrubbery</s>  they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining

they were of course all intending to be surprised but theirastonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs</s> bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them eveninferior

rational scheme to be sure</s>  but from what the reportof their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imaginetill she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingleyand her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when theexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supplythe idea</s>  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of
