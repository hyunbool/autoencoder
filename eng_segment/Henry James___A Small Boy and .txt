that our passage therein the early afternoon was beset with danger and our impression thatwe saw fragments of rock hurtle through the air and smite to the earthanother and yet another of the persons

descried from afar would enable or compel us torenew the feat</s>  that i didnt for myself inveterately renew it i seem toinfer from the memory of other perambulations of the periodas to whichi am divided between their still present freshness and my sense ofperhaps making too much of these tiny particles of history</s>  my strongerrule however i confess and the one by which i must here consistentlybe guided is that from the moment it is a question of projecting apicture no particle that counts for memory or is appreciable to thespirit can be too tiny and that experience in the name

contemplations and feel how the sense of my being sobeing at any rate master of my short steps such as they were throughall the beguiling streets was probably the very savour of each of mychance feasts</s>  which stirs in me at the same time some wonder at theliberty of range and opportunity of adventure allowed to my tender agethough the puzzle may very well drop after all as i ruefully

refinements on theindividual one still undeveloped welcomed almost any influence thatmight help at all to form their children to civility</s>  yet i rememberthat particular influence as more noisy and drowsy and dusty thananything elseas to which it must have partaken strongly of the generalnature of new brighton a neighbourhood that no apt agency whatever hadup to that time concerned itself to

was a very big newfoundland dog onwhose back i was put to ride</s>  that must have been my first vision of theliberal lifethough i further ask myself what my age could possiblyhave been when my weight was so fantastically far from hinting at laterdevelopments</s>  but the romance of the hour was particularly in what ihave called the eccentric note the fact that the children myentertainers riveted my gaze to stockingless and shoeless legs andfeet conveying somehow at the same time that they were not poor anddestitute but rich and providedjust as i took their gardenfeast for asign of overflowing

methodcertainly never quite raged among us but it was our fortunenevertheless that everything had its turn and that such indifferenceswere no more pedantic than certain rigours might perhaps have been

trying tobreathe again</s>  that definite reflection is that if we had not had in usto some degree the root of the matter no method however confessedly oraggressively pedantic would much have availed

of as great a dignity</s> it may be asked me i recognise of the root of what matter i socomplacently speak and if i say why of the matter of our having withconsiderable intensity proved educable or if

it is too much to say that our so preponderantly humanised andsocialised adolescence was to make us look out for these things with asubtle indirectness but i return to my proposition that there may

honorine she was clmentineor augustinewhich is a trifle since what i thus recover in any caseof these brushings of the strange parisian dew is those communities ofcontemplation that made us most hang

shutters of the shops seemed taken down at thathour for our especial benefit and i remember well how the dressingof so large a number of the compact and richly condensed fronts beingmore often than
