the room fronted the west but a black cloud barred with red robbedthe hour of twilights tranquil charm</s>  shadows haunted it lurking incorners like spies set there to watch the man who stood among them muteand motionless as if himself a shadow</s>  his eye turned often to thewindow with a glance both vigilant and eager yet saw nothing but atropical luxuriance of foliage scarcely stirred by the sultry air heavywith odors that seemed to oppress not refresh</s>  he listened with the sameintentness yet heard only the clamor of voices the tramp of feet thechime of bells the varied turmoil of a city when night is defrauded ofits peace by being turned to day</s>  he watched and waited for somethingpresently it came</s>  a viewless visitant welcomed by longing soul andbody as the man with extended arms and parted lips received thevoiceless greeting of the breeze that came winging its way across thebroad atlantic full of healthful cheer for a homesick heart</s>  far outhe leaned held back the thickleaved boughs already rustling with agrateful stir chid the shrill bird beating its flamecolored breastagainst its prison bars and drank deep draughts of the blessed windthat seemed to cool the fever of his blood and give him back the vigorhe had lost</s> a sudden light shone out behind him filling the room with a glow thatleft no shadow in it</s>  but he did not see the change nor hear the stepthat broke the hush nor turn to meet the woman who stood waiting for alovers welcome</s>  an indefinable air of sumptuous life surrounded herand made the brilliant room a fitting frame for the figure standingthere with warmhued muslins blowing in the wind</s>  a figure full of theaffluent beauty of womanhood in its prime bearing unmistakable marks ofthe polished pupil of the world in the grace that flowed through everymotion the art which taught each feature to play its part with the easeof second nature and made dress the foil to loveliness</s>  the face wasdelicate and dark as a fine bronze a low forehead set in shadowy wavesof hair eyes full of slumberous fire and a passionate yet haughtymouth that seemed shaped alike for caresses and commands</s> a moment she watched the man before her while over her countenancepassed rapid variations of pride resentment and tenderness</s>  then witha stealthy step an assured smile she went to him and touched his handsaying in a voice inured to that language which seems made for loverslipsonly a month betrothed and yet so cold and gloomy adam</s> with a slight recoil a glance of soft detestation veiled and yetvisible warwick

action swept her from him</s>  the smile died on her lips aforeboding fear looked out at her eyes and she asked incredulouslydo you mean it</s> yes now entirely and forever</s> if he had lifted his strong arm and struck her it would not havedaunted with such pale dismay</s>  an instant she stood like one who saw achasm widening before her which she had no power to cross</s>  then as

disdainful smile passed over warwicks face as with an eye that fixedand held her own he rapidly went on never pausing to choose smoothphrases or soften facts but seeming to find a relish in the utteranceof bitter truths after the honeyed falsehood he had listened to so long</s> yet through all the harshness glowed the courage of an upright soul thefervor of a generous heart</s> i know little

worse for it</s>  in melting frost i have kindledfire a fire that will burn all virtue out of me unless i quench it atonce</s>  i mean to do so because i will not keep the ten commandmentsbefore mens

draught is bitter</s>  hear me out for thisreminiscence is my justification you must listen to the one and acceptthe other</s>  you seemed all this but under the honest friendliness youshowed lurked

had said truly you shall see me at my best as at worst</s>  she didfor putting pride underneath his feet he showed her a brave sinceritywhich she could admire but never imitate and in owning a defeatachieved a victory</s> you think i shall deny this</s>  i do not but acknowledge to the uttermostthat in spite of all resistance i was conquered by a woman</s>  if itaffords you satisfaction to hear this to know that it is hard to sayharder still to feel take the ungenerous delight i give it to you asan alms</s>  but remember that if i have failed no less have you</s>  for inthat stormy

no respect for the passion youinspire own no allegiance to the dominion you assert</s> you cannot throw it off it is too late</s> it was a rash defiance she saw that as it passed her lips and wouldhave given much to have recalled it</s>  the stern gravity of warwicks faceflashed into a stern indignation</s>  his eye shone like steel but hisvoice dropped lower and his hand closed like a vice as he said with theair of one who cannot conceal but can control sudden wrath at a taunt towhich past weakness gives a double stingit never is too late</s>  if the priest stood ready and i had

atonement but i will hold fastmine integrity and obey a higher law than your world recognizes bothfor your sake and my own</s> she watched him as he spoke and to herself confessed a slavery moreabsolute than any he had known for with a pang she felt that she hadindeed fallen into the snare she spread for him and in this man whodared to own his weakness and her power she had found a master</s>  was ittoo late to keep him</s>  she knew that soft appeals were vain tears likewater on a rock and with the skill that had subdued him once sheendeavored to retrieve her blunder by an equanimity which had moreeffect than prayers or protestations</s>  warwick had read her well hadshown her herself stripped of all disguises and left her no defence buttardy candor</s>  she had the wisdom to see this the wit to use it andrestore the shadow of the power whose substance she had lost</s>  leavingher beauty to its silent work she fixed on him eyes whose lustre wasquenched in unshed

straight through the one vulnerable point in the mans pride went thisappeal to the mans pity</s>  indignation could not turn it aside contemptblunt its edge or wounded feeling lessen its force and yet it failedfor in adam warwick justice was stronger than mercy reason thanimpulse head than heart</s>  experience was a teacher whom he trusted hehad weighed this woman and found her wanting truth was not in her thepatient endeavor the hardwon success so possible to many was hardly soto her and a union between them could bring no lasting good to either</s> he knew this had decided it in a calmer

the same bitter draught ofselfcontempt that proved a tonic to my own weak will</s>  i can help pityand forgive you heartily but i dare not marry you</s>  the tie that bindsus is a passion of the senses not a love of the soul</s>  you lack themoral sentiment that makes all gifts and graces subservient to thevirtues that render womanhood a thing to honor as well as love</s>  i canrelinquish

gloom that was never wholly lost</s>  thevoice too which should have been a girlish treble was full and low asa matured womans with now and then a silvery ring to it as if anotherand a blither

fringed the shore she sprang up the bankand leaving a basket behind her by way of hint hurried to the sandyknoll where to her great satisfaction she found the vines heavy withberries</s>  as warwick joined her she held up a shining cluster sayingwith a touch of exultation in her voicemy faith is rewarded taste and believe</s> he accepted them with a nod and said pleasantlyas my prophecy has

the boat shot down the stream leaving a track of foam behindit as warwick rowed with the energy of one bent on outstripping someimportunate remembrance or dogging care</s>  sylvia marvelled greatly at thechange which came upon him but held fast with flying hair and lipsapart to catch the spray enjoying the breezy flight along a pathtessellated with broad bars of blue and gold</s>  the race ended as

whose passions as his virtues were in unisonwith the powerful body they inhabited and in such a crisis as thepresent but one of two reliefs were possible to him either wrathfuldenunciation expostulation and despair or the abandon of a child</s> against the former he had been struggling dumbly till sylvias words hadturned the tide and too entirely natural to feel a touch of shame atthat which is not a weakness but a strength too wise to reject so safean outlet for so dangerous a grief he yielded to it letting themerciful magic of tears quench the fire wash the first bitterness awayand leave reproaches only writ in water</s>  it was better so and sylviaacknowledged it within herself as she sat mute and motionless softlytouching the brown hair scattered on the moss her poor

would let me do thisbecause he has suffered as i suffer now</s> bending he gathered her to an embrace as different from that other asdespair is from delight and while he held her there crowding into
