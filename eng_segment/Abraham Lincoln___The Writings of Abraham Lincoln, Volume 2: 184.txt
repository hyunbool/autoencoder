precinctand that the whole shall take place on the same day i do not personallyobject</s>  they seem to me to be not unfair and i forbear to join inproposing them only because i choose to leave the

abolition movementto williamson durley</s> springfield october 3 1845when i saw you at home it was agreed that i should write to you and yourbrother madison</s>  until i then saw you i was not aware of your being whatis generally called an abolitionist or as you call yourself a libertyman though i well knew there were many such in your country</s> i was glad to hear that you intended to attempt to bring about at thenext election in putnam a union of the whigs proper and such of theliberty men as are whigs in principle on all questions save only that ofslavery</s>  so far as i can perceive by such union neither party needyield anything on the point in difference between them</s>  if the whigabolitionists of new york had voted with us last fall mr</s>  clay would nowbe president whig principles in the ascendant and texas not annexedwhereas by the division all that either had at stake in the contest waslost</s>  and indeed it was extremely probable beforehand that such wouldbe the result</s>  as i always understood the liberty men deprecated theannexation of texas extremely and this being so why they should refuseto cast their votes so as to prevent it even to me seemed wonderful</s> what was their process of reasoning i can only judge from what a singleone of them told me</s>  it was this we are not to do evil that good maycome</s>  this general proposition is doubtless correct but did it apply</s> if by your votes you could have prevented the extension etc</s>  of slaverywould it not have been good and not evil so to have used your voteseven though it involved the casting of them for a slaveholder</s>  by thefruit the tree is to be known</s>  an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit</s> if the fruit of electing mr</s>  clay would have been to prevent the extensionof slavery could the act of electing have been evil</s> but i will not argue further</s>  i perhaps ought to say that individually inever was much interested in the texas question</s>  i never could seemuch good to come of annexation inasmuch as they were already a freerepublican people on our own model</s>  on the other hand i never couldvery clearly see how the annexation would augment the evil of slavery</s> it always seemed to me that slaves would be taken there in about equalnumbers with or without annexation</s>  and if more were taken because ofannexation still there would be just so many the fewer left wherethey were taken from</s>  it is possibly true to some extent that withannexation some slaves may be sent to texas and continued in slavery thatotherwise might have been liberated</s>  to whatever extent this may be truei think annexation an evil</s>  i hold it to be a paramount duty of us in thefree states due to the union of the states and perhaps to liberty itselfparadox though it may seem to let the slavery of the other statesalone while on the other hand i hold it to be equally clear that weshould never knowingly lend ourselves directly or indirectly to preventthat slavery from dying a natural deathto find new places for it tolive in when it can no longer exist in the old</s>  of course i am not nowconsidering what would be our duty in cases of insurrection among theslaves</s>  to recur to the texas question i understand the liberty men tohave viewed annexation as a much greater evil than ever i did and i wouldlike to convince you if i could that they could have prevented it ifthey had chosen</s>  i intend this letter for you and madison together andif you and he or either shall think fit to drop me a

thisi would rather not submit to</s>  that hardin is talented energetic usuallygenerous and magnanimous i have before this affirmed to you and do notdeny</s>  you know that my only argument is that

morganor of morgan  scott</s>  i only had in my mind the fact that previous togeneral hardins withdrawal some of his friends and some of mine hadbecome a little warm and i felt and meant to say that

greater needof having their feelings corrected than mine were</s>  since i saw you atjacksonville i have had no more suspicion of the whigs of morgan thanof those of any other part of the district</s>

the blood of our fellowcitizens on our ownsoiland again in his message of december 8 1846 that we had ample cause ofwar against mexico long before the breaking out of hostilities but eventhen we forbore to take redress into our own hands until mexico herselfbecame the aggressor by invading our soil in hostile array and sheddingthe blood of our citizensand yet again in his message of december 7 1847 that the mexicangovernment refused even to hear the terms of adjustment which he ourminister of peace was authorized to propose and finally under whollyunjustifiable pretexts involved the two countries in war by invading theterritory of the state of texas striking the first blow and shedding theblood of our citizens on our own soiland whereas this house is desirous to obtain a full

begged to assure his friendson the other side of the house that no assault whatever was meant upon thepostmastergeneral and he was glad that what the gentleman had now saidmodified to a great extent

postoffice was composed of five whigs and four democrats andtheir report was understood as sustaining not impugning the positiontaken by the postmastergeneral</s>  that report had met with the approbationof all the whigs and of all the democrats also with the exceptionof one and he wanted to go even further than this</s>  intimation wasinformally given mr</s>  lincoln that it was not in

referred to the report made to thehouse by the postmastergeneral and had intimated an apprehension thatgentlemen would be disposed to rely on that report alone and derivetheir views of the case from

were not disputed</s>  if he wasright in this he supposed the house might assume the facts to be as theywere stated and thence proceed to draw their own conclusions</s> the gentleman had said that the postmastergeneral had got into a personalsquabble with the railroad company</s>  of this mr</s>  lincoln knew nothing nordid he need or desire to know anything because it had nothing whatever todo

lincoln would assure thegentleman that if there was a proper way of doing it no man was moreanxious than he that it should be done</s>  the report made by the committeehad been intended to yield much for the sake of removing that grievance</s> that the grievance was very great there was no dispute in any quarter</s>  hesupposed that the statements made by the gentleman from virginia to showthis

postmastergeneralsays he cannot give to this company more than two hundred and thirtysevendollars and fifty cents per railroad mile of transportation and twelveand a half per cent</s>  less for

asgood citizens and patriots remain silent on that point at least till thewar should be ended</s>  some leading democrats including expresident vanburen have taken this same view as i understand them and i adheredto it and acted upon it until since i took my seat here and i think ishould still adhere to it were it not that the president and his friendswill not allow it to be so</s>  besides the continual effort of the presidentto argue every silent vote given for supplies into an indorsement ofthe justice and wisdom of his conduct besides that singularly candidparagraph in his late message in which he tells us that congress withgreat unanimity had declared that by the act of the republic of mexicoa state of war exists between that government and the united states whenthe same journals that informed him of this also informed him thatwhen that declaration stood disconnected from the question of suppliessixtyseven in the house and not fourteen merely voted against itbesides this open attempt to prove by telling the truth what he could notprove by telling the whole truthdemanding of all who will not submit tobe misrepresented in justice to themselves to speak out besides allthis one of my colleagues mr</s>  richardson at a very early day in thesession brought in a set of resolutions expressly indorsing the originaljustice of the war on the part of the president</s>  upon these resolutionswhen they shall be put on their passage i shall be compelled to vote sothat i cannot be silent if i would</s>  seeing this i went about preparingmyself to give the vote understandingly when it should come</s>  i carefullyexamined the presidents message to ascertain what he himself had saidand proved upon the point</s>  the result of this examination was to make theimpression that taking for true all the president states as facts hefalls far short of proving his justification and that the president wouldhave gone further with his proof if it had not been for the small matterthat the truth would not permit him</s>  under the impression thus made i gavethe vote before mentioned</s>  i propose now to give concisely the processof the examination i made and how i reached the conclusion i did</s>
 thepresident in his first war message of may 1846 declares that the soilwas ours on which hostilities were commenced by mexico and he repeatsthat declaration almost in the same language in each successive annualmessage thus showing that he deems that point a highly essential one</s>  inthe importance of that point i entirely agree with the president</s>  tomy judgment it is the very point upon which he should be justified orcondemned</s>  in his message of december 1846 it seems to have occurred tohim as is certainly true that titleownershipto soil or anything elseis not a simple fact but is a conclusion following on one or more simplefacts and that it was incumbent upon him to present the facts from whichhe concluded the soil was ours on which the first blood of the war wasshed</s> accordingly a little below the middle of page twelve in the message lastreferred to he enters upon that task forming an issue and introducingtestimony extending the whole to a little below the middle of pagefourteen</s>  now i propose to try to show that the whole of thisissue andevidenceis from beginning to end the sheerest deception</s>  the issue ashe presents it is in these words but there are those who conceding allthis to be true assume the ground that the true western boundary of texasis the nueces instead of the rio grande and that therefore in marchingour army to the east bank of the latter river we passed the texas lineand invaded the territory of mexico</s>  now this issue is made up of twoaffirmatives and no negative</s>  the main deception of it is that it assumesas true that one river or the other is necessarily the boundary andcheats the superficial thinker entirely out of the idea that possiblythe boundary is somewhere between the two and not actually at either</s>  afurther deception is that it will let in evidence which a true issue wouldexclude</s>  a true issue made by the president would be about as follows isay the soil was ours on which the first blood was shed there are thosewho say it was not</s> i now proceed to examine the presidents evidence as applicable to such anissue</s>  when that evidence is analyzed it is all included in the followingpropositions1 that the rio grande was the western boundary of louisiana as wepurchased it of france in 1803</s> 2 that the republic of texas always claimed the rio grande as hereastern boundary</s> 3 that by various acts she had claimed it on paper</s> 4 that santa anna in his treaty with texas recognized the rio grande asher boundary</s> 5 that texas before and the united states after annexation hadexercised jurisdiction beyond the nuecesbetween the two rivers</s> 6 that our congress understood the boundary of texas to extend beyondthe nueces</s> now for each of these in its turn</s>  his first item is that the rio grandewas the western boundary of louisiana as we purchased it of france in1803 and seeming to expect this to be disputed he argues over the amountof nearly a page to prove it true at the end of which he lets us knowthat by the treaty of 1803 we sold to spain the whole country from the riogrande eastward to the sabine</s>  now admitting for the present that therio grande was the boundary of louisiana what under heaven had that todo with the present boundary between us and mexico</s>  how mr</s>
 chairmanthe line that once divided your land from mine can still be theboundary between us after i have sold my land to you is to me beyond allcomprehension</s>  and how any man with an honest purpose only of proving thetruth could ever have thought of introducing such a fact to prove such anissue is equally incomprehensible</s>  his next piece of evidence is that therepublic of texas always claimed this river rio grande as her westernboundary</s>  that is not true in fact</s>  texas has claimed it but she hasnot always claimed it</s>  there is at least one distinguished exception</s>  herstate constitution the republics most solemn and wellconsideredact that which may without impropriety be called her last will andtestament revoking all othersmakes no such claim</s>  but suppose she hadalways claimed it</s>  has not mexico always claimed the contrary</s>  so thatthere is but claim against claim leaving nothing proved until we get backof the claims and find which has the better foundation</s>  though not in theorder in which the president presents his evidence i now consider thatclass of his statements which are in substance nothing more than thattexas has by various acts of her convention and congress claimed therio grande as her boundary on paper</s>  i mean here what he says about thefixing of the rio grande as her boundary in her old constitution not herstate constitution about forming congressional districts counties etc</s> now all of this is but naked claim and what i have already said aboutclaims is strictly applicable to this</s>  if i should claim your land by wordof mouth that certainly would not make it mine and if i were to claim itby a deed which i had made myself and with which you had had nothing todo the claim would be quite the same in substanceor rather in utternothingness</s>  i next consider the presidents statement that santa anna inhis treaty with texas recognized the rio grande as the western boundaryof texas</s>  besides the position so often taken that santa anna while aprisoner of war a captive could not bind mexico by a treaty which ideem conclusivebesides this i wish to say something in relation to thistreaty so called by the president with santa anna</s>  if any man would liketo be amused by a sight of that little thing which the president calls bythat big name he can have it by turning to niless register vol</s>  1p</s>  336</s>  and if any one should suppose that niless register is a curiousrepository of so mighty a document as a solemn treaty between nations ican only say that i learned to a tolerable degree of certainty by inquiryat the state department that the president himself never saw it anywhereelse</s>  by the way i believe i should not err if i were to declare thatduring the first ten years of the existence of that document it wasnever by anybody called a treatythat it was never so called till thepresident in his extremity attempted by so calling it to wring somethingfrom it in justification of himself in connection with the mexican war</s> it has none of the distinguishing features of a treaty</s>  it does not callitself a treaty</s>  santa anna does not therein assume to bind mexico heassumes only to act as the presidentcommanderinchief of the mexicanarmy and navy stipulates that the then present hostilities should ceaseand that he would not himself take up arms nor influence the mexicanpeople to take up arms against texas during the existence of the war ofindependence</s>  he did not recognize the independence of texas he did notassume to put an end to the war but clearly indicated his expectationof its continuance he did not say one word about boundary and mostprobably never thought of it</s>  it is stipulated therein that the mexicanforces should evacuate the territory of texas passing to the otherside of the rio grande and in another article it is stipulated that toprevent collisions between the armies the texas army should not approachnearer than within five leaguesof what is not said but clearly fromthe object stated it is of the rio grande</s>  now if this is a treatyrecognizing the rio grande as the boundary of texas it contains thesingular feature of stipulating that texas shall not go within fiveleagues of her own boundary</s> next comes the evidence of texas before annexation and the united statesafterwards exercising jurisdiction beyond the nueces and between the tworivers</s>  this actual exercise of jurisdiction is the very class or qualityof evidence we want</s>  it is excellent so far as it goes but does it go farenough</s>  he tells us it went beyond the nueces but he does not tell us itwent to the rio grande</s>  he tells us jurisdiction was exercised betweenthe two rivers but he does not tell us it was exercised over all theterritory between them</s>  some simpleminded people think it is possible tocross one river and go beyond it without going all the way to the nextthat jurisdiction may be exercised between two rivers without coveringall the country between them</s>  i know a man not very unlike myself whoexercises jurisdiction over a piece of land between the wabash and themississippi and yet so far is this from being all there is between thoserivers that it is just one hundred and fiftytwo feet long by fifty feetwide and no part of it much within a hundred miles of either</s>  he has aneighbor between him and the mississippithat is just across the streetin that directionwhom i am sure he could neither persuade nor force togive up his habitation but which nevertheless he could certainly annexif it were to be done by merely standing on his own side of the street andclaiming it or even sitting down and writing a deed for it</s> but next the president tells us the congress of the united statesunderstood the state of texas they admitted into the union to extendbeyond the nueces</s>  well i suppose they did</s>  i certainly so understood it</s> but how far beyond</s>  that congress did not understand it to extend clearto the rio grande is quite certain by the fact of their joint resolutionsfor admission expressly leaving all questions of boundary to futureadjustment</s>  and it may be added that texas herself is proven to have hadthe same understanding of it that our congress had by the fact of theexact conformity of her new constitution to those resolutions</s> i am now through the whole of the presidents evidence and it is asingular fact that if any one should declare the president sent the armyinto the midst of a settlement of mexican people who had never submittedby consent or by force to the authority of texas or of the united statesand that there and thereby the first blood of the war was shed there isnot one word in all the which would either admit or deny the declaration</s> this strange omission it does seem to me could not have occurred but bydesign</s>  my way of living leads me to be about the courts of justice andthere i have sometimes seen a good lawyer struggling for his clientsneck in a desperate case employing every artifice to work round befogand cover up with many words some point arising in the case which he darednot admit and yet could not deny</s>  party bias may help to make it appearso but with all the allowance i can make for such bias it stilldoes appear to me that just such and from just such necessity is thepresidents struggle in this case</s> sometime after my colleague mr</s>  richardson introduced the resolutions ihave mentioned i introduced a preamble resolution and interrogationsintended to draw the president out if possible on this hithertountrodden ground</s>  to show their relevancy i propose to state myunderstanding of the true rule for ascertaining the boundary between texasand mexico</s>  it is that wherever texas was exercising jurisdiction washers and wherever mexico was exercising jurisdiction was hers and thatwhatever separated the actual exercise of jurisdiction of the one fromthat of the other was the true boundary between them</s>  if as is probablytrue texas was exercising jurisdiction along the western bank of thenueces and mexico was exercising it along the eastern bank of the riogrande then neither river was the boundary but the uninhabited countrybetween the two was</s>  the extent of our territory in that region dependednot on any treatyfixed boundary for no treaty had attempted it but onrevolution</s>  any people anywhere being inclined and having the power havethe right to rise up and shake off the existing government and form anew one that suits them better</s>  this is a most valuable a most sacredrighta right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world</s>  noris this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existinggovernment may choose to exercise it</s>  any portion of such people that canmay revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as theyinhabit</s>  more than this a majority of any portion of such people mayrevolutionize putting down a minority intermingled with or near aboutthem who may oppose this movement</s>  such minority was precisely the caseof the tories of our own revolution</s>  it is a quality of revolutions not togo by old lines or old laws but to break up both and make new ones</s> as to the country now in question we bought it of france in 1803 andsold it to spain in 1819 according to the presidents statements</s>  afterthis all mexico including texas revolutionized against spain and stilllater texas revolutionized against mexico</s>  in my view just so far asshe carried her resolution by obtaining the actual willing or unwillingsubmission of the people so far the country was hers and no farther</s> now sir for the purpose of obtaining the very best evidence as towhether texas had actually carried her revolution to the place where thehostilities of the present war commenced let the president answer theinterrogatories i proposed as before mentioned or some other similarones</s>  let him answer fully fairly and candidly</s>  let him answer withfacts and not with arguments</s>  let him remember he sits where washingtonsat and so remembering let him answer as washington would answer</s>  asa nation should not and the almighty will not be evaded so let himattempt no evasionno equivocation</s>  and if so answering he can showthat the soil was ours where the first blood of the war was shedthatit was not within an inhabited country or if within such that theinhabitants had submitted themselves to the civil authority of texas orof the united states and that the same is true of the site of fort brownthen i am with him for his justification</s>  in that case i shall be mosthappy to reverse the vote i gave the other day</s>  i have a selfish motivefor desiring that the president may do thisi expect to gain some votesin connection with the war which without his so doing will be ofdoubtful propriety in my own judgment but which will be free from thedoubt if he does so</s>  but if he can not or will not do thisif on anypretence or no pretence he shall refuse or omit it then i shall be fullyconvinced of what i more than suspect already that he is deeply consciousof being in the wrong that he feels the blood of this war like the bloodof abel is crying to heaven against him that originally having somestrong motivewhat i will not stop now to give my opinion concerningto involve the two countries in a war and trusting to escape scrutinyby fixing the public gaze upon the exceeding brightness of militaryglorythat attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood thatserpents eye that charms to destroyhe plunged into it and was swepton and on till disappointed in his calculation of the ease with whichmexico might be subdued he now finds himself he knows not where</s>  how likethe half insane mumbling of a fever dream is the whole war part of hislate message</s>  at one time telling us that mexico has nothing whatever thatwe can getbut territory at another showing us how we can support thewar by levying contributions on mexico</s>  at one time urging the nationalhonor the security of the future the prevention of foreign interferenceand even the good of mexico herself as among the objects of the war atanother telling us that to reject indemnity by refusing to accept acession of territory would be to abandon all our just demands and towage the war bearing all its expenses without a purpose or definiteobject</s>  so then this national honor security of the future andeverything but territorial indemnity may be considered the nopurposes andindefinite objects of the war</s>  but having it now settled that territorialindemnity is the only object we are urged to seize by legislation hereall that he was content to take a few months ago and the whole provinceof lower california to boot and to still carry on the war to take allwe are fighting for and still fight on</s>  again the president is resolvedunder all circumstances to have full territorial indemnity for theexpenses of the war but he forgets to tell us how we are to get theexcess after those expenses shall have surpassed the value of the wholeof the mexican territory</s>  so again he insists that the separate nationalexistence of mexico shall be maintained but he does not tell us howthis can be done after we shall have taken all her territory</s>  lest thequestions i have suggested be considered speculative merely let me beindulged a moment in trying to show they are not</s>  the war has gone on sometwenty months for the expenses of which together with an inconsiderableold score the president now claims about one half of the mexicanterritory and that by far the better half so far as concerns our abilityto make anything out of it</s>  it is comparatively uninhabited so that wecould establish landoffices in it and raise some money in that way</s>  butthe other half is already inhabited as i understand it tolerablydensely for the nature of the country and all its lands or all that arevaluable already appropriated as private property</s>  how then are we tomake anything out of these lands with this encumbrance on them</s>  or howremove the encumbrance</s>  i suppose no one would say we should kill thepeople or drive them out or make slaves of them or confiscate theirproperty</s>  how then can we make much out of this part of the territory</s> if the prosecution of the war has in expenses already equalled the betterhalf of the country how long its future prosecution will be in equallingthe less valuable half is not a speculative but a practical questionpressing closely upon us</s>  and yet it is a question which the presidentseems never to have thought of</s>  as to the mode of terminating the war andsecuring peace the president is equally wandering and indefinite</s>  firstit is to be done by a more vigorous prosecution of the war in the vitalparts of the enemys country and after apparently talking himself tiredon this point the president drops down into a halfdespairing toneand tells us that with a people distracted and divided by contendingfactions and a government subject to constant changes by successiverevolutions the continued success of our arms may fail to secure asatisfactory peace</s>  then he suggests the propriety of wheedling themexican people to desert the counsels of their own leaders and trustingin our protestations to set up a government from which we can securea satisfactory peace telling us that this may become the only mode ofobtaining such a peace</s>  but soon he falls into doubt of this too andthen drops back on to the already halfabandoned ground of more vigorousprosecution</s>  all this shows that the president is in nowise satisfiedwith his own positions</s>  first he takes up one and in attempting to argueus into it he argues himself out of it then seizes another and goesthrough the same process and then confused at being able to think ofnothing new he snatches up the old one again which he has some timebefore cast off</s>  his mind taxed beyond its power is running hither andthither like some tortured creature on a burning surface finding noposition on which it can settle down and be at ease</s> again it is a singular omission in this message that it nowhere intimateswhen the president expects the war to terminate</s>  at its beginning generalscott was by this same president driven into disfavor if not disgrace forintimating that peace could not be conquered in less than three or fourmonths</s>  but now at the end of about twenty months during which time ourarms have given us the most splendid successes every department and everypart land and water officers and privates regulars and volunteersdoing all that men could do and hundreds of things which it had everbefore been thought men could not doafter all this this same presidentgives a long message without showing us that as to the end he himself haseven an imaginary conception</s>  as i have before said he knows not where heis</s>  he is a bewildered confounded and miserably perplexed man</s>  god granthe may be able to show there is not something about his conscience morepainful than his mental perplexity</s> the following is a copy of the socalled treaty referred to in

however has not been insensible to its duty of guarding thepostoffice department against injurious sacrifices for the accomplishmentof this object whereby its ordinary efficacy might be impaired orembarrassed</s>  it has therefore been a subject of much consideration butit is now confidently hoped that the bill herewith submitted effectuallyobviates all objections which might exist with regard to a less maturedproposition</s> the committee learned upon inquiry that the postoffice departmentin view of meeting the general wish on this subject made the experimentthrough one if its own internal regulations when the new postage systemwent into operation on the first of july 1845 and that it was continueduntil the thirtieth of september 1847</s>  but this experiment for reasonshereafter stated proved unsatisfactory and it was discontinued byorder of the postmastergeneral</s>  as far as the committee can at presentascertain the following seem to have been the principal grounds ofdissatisfaction in this experiment1 the legal responsibility of postmasters receiving newspapersubscriptions or of their sureties was not defined</s> 2 the authority was open to all postmasters instead of being limited tothose of specific offices</s> 3 the consequence of this extension of authority was that ininnumerable instances the money without the previous knowledge orcontrol of the officers of the department who are responsible for the goodmanagement of its finances was deposited in offices where it was impropersuch funds should be placed and the repayment was ordered not bythe financial officers but by the postmasters at points where it wasinconvenient to the department so to disburse its funds</s> 4 the inconvenience of accumulating uncertain and fluctuating sums atsmall offices was felt seriously in consequent overpayments to contractorson their quarterly collecting orders and in case of private mail routesin litigation concerning the misapplication of such funds to the specialservice of supplying mails</s> 5 the accumulation of such funds on draft offices could not be knownto the financial clerks of the department in time to control it and toooften this rendered uncertain all their calculations of funds in hand</s> 6 the orders of payment were for the most part issued upon the principaloffices such as new york philadelphia boston baltimore etc</s>  wherethe large offices of publishers are located causing an illimitable anduncontrollable drain of the department funds from those points whereit was essential to husband them for its own regular disbursements</s>  inphiladelphia alone this drain averaged 5000 per quarter and in othercities of the seaboard it was proportionate</s> 7 the embarrassment of the department was increased by the illimitableuncontrollable and irresponsible scattering of its funds fromconcentrated points suitable for its distributions to remote unsafe andinconvenient offices where they could not be again made available tillcollected by special agents or were transferred at considerable expenseinto the principal disbursing offices again</s> 8 there was a vast increase of duties thrown upon the limited forcebefore necessary to conduct the business of the department and from thedelay of obtaining vouchers impediments arose to the speedy settlement ofaccounts with present or retired postmasters causing postponements whichendangered the liability of sureties under the act of limitations andcausing much danger of an increase of such cases</s> 9 the most responsible postmasters at the large offices were orderedby the least responsible at small offices to make payments upon theirvouchers without having the means of ascertaining whether these voucherswere genuine or forged or if genuine whether the signers were in or outof office or solvent or defaulters</s> 10 the transaction of this business for subscribers and publishers atthe public expense an the embarrassment inconvenience and delay ofthe departments own business occasioned by it were not justified by anysufficient remuneration of revenue to sustain the department as requiredin every other respect with regard to its agency</s> the committee in view of these objections has been solicitous to framea bill which would not be obnoxious to them in principle or in practicaleffect</s> it is confidently believed that by limiting the offices for receivingsubscriptions to less than one tenth of the number authorized by theexperiment already tried and designating the county seat in eachcounty for the purpose the control of the department will be renderedsatisfactory particularly as it will be in the power of the auditorwho is the officer required by law to check the accounts to approve ordisapprove of the deposits and to sanction not only the payments but topoint out the place of payment</s>  if these payments should cause a drainon the principal offices of the seaboard it will be compensated by theaccumulation of funds at county seats where the contractors on thoseroutes can be paid to that extent by the departments drafts with morelocal convenience to themselves than by drafts on the seaboard offices</s> the legal responsibility for these deposits is defined and theaccumulation of funds at the point of deposit and the repayment atpoints drawn upon being known to and controlled by the auditor will notoccasion any such embarrassments as were before felt the record keptby the auditor on the passing of the certificates through his hands willenable him to settle accounts without the delay occasioned by vouchersbeing withheld all doubt or uncertainty as to the genuineness ofcertificates or the propriety of their issue will be removed by theauditors examination and approval and there can be no risk of lossof funds by transmission as the certificate will not be payable tillsanctioned by the auditor and after his sanction the payor need not payit unless it is presented by the publisher or his known clerk or agent</s> the main principle of equivalent for the agency of the department issecured by the postage required to be paid upon the transmission of thecertificates augmenting adequately the postoffice revenue</s> the committee conceiving that in this report all the difficulties of thesubject have been fully and fairly stated and that these difficultieshave been obviated by the plan proposed in the accompanying bill andbelieving that the measure will satisfactorily meet the wants and wishesof a very large portion of the community beg leave to recommend itsadoption</s> report in the house of representativesmarch 9 1848</s> mr</s>  lincoln from the committee on the postoffice and post roads made

he mr</s>  l</s>  did notsay there were many but he was very confident there were some</s>  his friendfrom kentucky near him mr</s>  gaines told him he himself was one</s> there was still another

11 1848</s> a bill for the admission of wisconsin into the union had been passed</s> mr</s>  lincoln moved to reconsider the vote by which the bill was passed</s> he stated to the house that he had made this motion for the purpose ofobtaining an opportunity to say a few words in relation to a point raisedin the course of the debate on this bill which he would now proceed tomake if in order</s>  the point in the case to which he referred arose on theamendment that was submitted by the gentleman from vermont mr</s>  collamerin committee of the whole on the state of the union and which wasafterward renewed in the house in relation to the question whether thereserved sections which by some bills heretofore passed by which anappropriation of land had been made to wisconsin had been enhanced invalue should be reduced to the minimum price of the public lands</s>  thequestion of the reduction in value of those sections was to him at thistime a matter very nearly of indifference</s>  he was inclined to desire thatwisconsin should be obliged by having it reduced</s>  but the gentleman fromindiana mr</s>  c</s>  b</s>  smith the chairman of the committee on territoriesyesterday associated that question with the general question which is nowto some extent agitated in congress of making appropriations of alternatesections of land to aid the states in making internal improvements andenhancing the price of the sections reserved and the gentleman fromindiana took ground against that policy</s>  he did not make any specialargument in favor of wisconsin but he took ground generally against thepolicy of giving alternate sections of land and enhancing the price ofthe reserved sections</s>  now he mr</s>  lincoln did not at this time take thefloor for the purpose of attempting to make an argument on the generalsubject</s>  he rose simply to protest against the doctrine which thegentleman from indiana had avowed in the course of what he mr</s>  lincolncould not but consider an unsound argument</s> it might however be true for anything he knew that the gentlemanfrom indiana might convince him that his argument was sound but he mr</s> lincoln feared that gentleman would not be able to convince a majorityin congress that it was sound</s>  it was true the question appeared in adifferent aspect to persons in consequence of a difference in the pointfrom which they looked at it</s>  it did not look to persons residing east ofthe mountains as it did to those who lived among the public lands</s>  butfor his part he would state that if congress would make a donation ofalternate sections of public land for the purpose of internal improvementsin his state and forbid the reserved sections being sold at 1</s> 25 heshould be glad to see the appropriation made though he should preferit if the reserved sections were not enhanced in price</s>  he repeated heshould be glad to have such appropriations made even though the reservedsections should be enhanced in price</s>  he did not wish to be understoodas concurring in any intimation that they would refuse to receive such anappropriation of alternate sections of land because a condition enhancingthe price of the reserved sections should be attached thereto</s>  he believedhis position would now be understood if not he feared he should not beable to make himself understood</s> but before he took his seat he would remark that the senate during thepresent session had passed a bill making appropriations of land on thatprinciple for the benefit of the state in which he resided the stateof illinois</s>  the alternate sections were to be given for the purpose ofconstructing roads and the reserved sections were to be enhanced in valuein consequence</s>  when that bill came here for the action of this houseithad been received and was now before the committee on public landshedesired much to see it passed as it was if it could be put in no morefavorable form for the state of illinois</s>  when it should be before thishouse if any member from a section of the union in which these landsdid not lie whose interest might be less than that which he felt shouldpropose a reduction of the price of the reserved sections to 1</s> 25 heshould be much obliged but he did not think it would be well for thosewho came from the section of the union in which the lands lay to doso</s> he wished it then to be understood that he did not join in thewarfare against the principle which had engaged the minds of some membersof congress who were favorable to the improvements in the western country</s> there was a good deal of force he admitted in what fell from thechairman of the committee on territories</s>  it might be that there was noprecise justice in raising the price of the reserved sections to 2</s> 50 peracre</s>  it might be proper that the price should be enhanced to some extentthough not to double the usual price but he should be glad to have suchan appropriation with the reserved sections at 2</s> 50 he should be betterpleased to have the price of those sections at something less and heshould be still better pleased to have them without any enhancement atall</s> there was one portion of the argument of the gentleman from indiana thechairman of the committee on territories mr</s>  smith which he wished totake occasion to say that he did not view as unsound</s>  he alluded to thestatement that the general government was interested in these internalimprovements being made inasmuch as they increased the value of the landsthat were unsold and they enabled the government to sell the lands whichcould not be sold without them</s>  thus then the government gained byinternal improvements as well as by the general good which the peoplederived from them and it might be therefore that the lands shouldnot be sold for more than 1</s> 50 instead of the price being doubled</s>  hehowever merely mentioned this in passing for he only rose to stateas the principle of giving these lands for the purposes which he hadmentioned had been laid hold of and considered favorably and as therewere some gentlemen who had constitutional scruples about giving moneyfor these purchases who would not hesitate to give land that he wasnot willing to have it understood that he was one of those who madewar against that

mr</s>  lincoln at an early day of this session the president sent us whatmay properly be called an internal improvement veto message</s>  the latedemocratic convention which sat at baltimore and which nominated generalcass for the presidency adopted a set of resolutions now called thedemocratic platform among which is one in these wordsthat the constitution does not confer upon the general government thepower to commence and carry on a general system of internal improvements</s> general cass in his letter accepting the nomination holds this languagei have carefully read the resolutions of the democratic nationalconvention laying down the platform of our political faith and i adhereto them as firmly as i approve them cordially</s> these things taken together show that the question of internalimprovements is now more distinctly madehas become more intensethanat any former period</s>  the veto message and the baltimore resolution iunderstand to be in substance the same thing the latter being the moregeneral statement of which the former is the amplification the bill ofparticulars</s>  while i know there are many democrats on this floor andelsewhere who disapprove that message i understand that all who votedfor general cass will thereafter be counted as having approved it ashaving indorsed all its doctrines</s> i suppose all or nearly all the democrats will vote for him</s>  many ofthem will do so not because they like his position on this questionbut because they prefer him being wrong on this to another whom theyconsider farther wrong on other questions</s>  in this way the internalimprovement democrats are to be by a sort of forced consent carried overand arrayed against themselves on this measure of policy</s>  general cassonce elected will not trouble himself to make a constitutional argumentor perhaps any argument at all when he shall veto a river or harbor billhe will consider it a sufficient answer to all democratic murmurs to pointto mr</s>  polks message and to the democratic platform</s>  this being thecase the question of improvements is verging to a final crisis and thefriends of this policy must now battle and battle manfully or surrenderall</s>  in this view humble as i am i wish to review and contest as wellas i may the general positions of this veto message</s>  when i say generalpositions i mean to exclude from consideration so much as relates to thepresent embarrassed state of the treasury in consequence of the mexicanwar</s> those general positions are that internal improvements ought not to bemade by the general governmentfirst</s>  because they would overwhelm thetreasury second</s>  because while their burdens would be general theirbenefits would be local and partial involving an obnoxious inequalityand third</s>  because they would be unconstitutional</s>  fourth</s>  because thestates may do enough by the levy and collection of tonnage duties or ifnotfifth</s>  that the constitution may be amended</s>  do nothing at all lestyou do something wrong is the sum of these positions is the sum ofthis message</s>  and this with the exception of what is said aboutconstitutionality applying as forcibly to what is said about makingimprovements by state authority as by the national authority so that wemust abandon the improvements of the country altogether by any and everyauthority or we must resist and repudiate the doctrines of this message</s> let us attempt the latter</s> the first position is that a system of internal improvements wouldoverwhelm the treasury</s>  that in such a system there is a tendency to undueexpansion is not to be denied</s>  such tendency is founded in the natureof the subject</s>  a member of congress will prefer voting for a bill whichcontains an appropriation for his district to voting for one whichdoes not and when a bill shall be expanded till every district shall beprovided for that it will be too greatly expanded is obvious</s>  but isthis any more true in congress than in a state legislature</s>  if a memberof congress must have an appropriation for his district so a member ofa legislature must have one for his county</s>  and if one will overwhelmthe national treasury so the other will overwhelm the state treasury</s>  gowhere we will the difficulty is the same</s>  allow it to drive us from thehalls of congress and it will just as easily drive us from the statelegislatures</s>  let us then grapple with it and test its strength</s>  letus judging of the future by the past ascertain whether there may not bein the discretion of congress a sufficient power to limit and restrainthis expansive tendency within reasonable and proper bounds</s>  the presidenthimself values the evidence of the past</s>  he tells us that at a certainpoint of our history more than two hundred millions of dollars had beenapplied for to make improvements and this he does to prove that thetreasury would be overwhelmed by such a system</s>  why did he not tell us howmuch was granted</s>  would not that have been better evidence</s>  let us turnto it and see what it proves</s>  in the message the president tells usthat during the four succeeding years embraced by the administration ofpresident adams the power not only to appropriate money but to apply itunder the direction and authority of the general government as well tothe construction of roads as to the improvement of harbors and riverswas fully asserted and exercised</s>  this then was the period of greatestenormity</s>  these if any must have been the days of the two hundredmillions</s>  and how much do you suppose was really expended for improvementsduring that four years</s>  two hundred millions</s>  one hundred</s>  fifty</s>  ten</s> five</s>  no sir less than two millions</s>  as shown by authentic documentsthe expenditures on improvements during 1825 1826 1827 and 1828amounted to one million eight hundred and seventynine thousand sixhundred and twentyseven dollars and one cent</s>  these four years were theperiod of mr</s>  adamss administration nearly and substantially</s>  this factshows that when the power to make improvements was fully asserted andexercised the congress did keep within reasonable limits and what hasbeen done it seems to me can be done again</s> now for the second portion of the messagenamely that the burdens ofimprovements would be general while their benefits would be local andpartial involving an obnoxious inequality</s>  that there is some degreeof truth in this position i shall not deny</s>  no commercial object ofgovernment patronage can be so exclusively general as to not be of somepeculiar local advantage</s>  the navy as i understand it was establishedand is maintained at a great annual expense partly to be ready forwar when war shall come and partly also and perhaps chiefly for theprotection of our commerce on the high seas</s>  this latter object is forall i can see in principle the same as internal improvements</s>  the drivinga pirate from the track of commerce on the broad ocean and the removingof a snag from its more narrow path in the mississippi river cannoti think be distinguished in principle</s>  each is done to save life andproperty and for nothing else</s> the navy then is the most general in its benefits of all this classof objects and yet even the navy is of some peculiar advantage tocharleston baltimore philadelphia new york and boston beyond what itis to the interior towns of illinois</s>  the next most general object ican think of would be improvements on the mississippi river and itstributaries</s>  they touch thirteen of our statespennsylvania virginiakentucky tennessee mississippi louisiana arkansas missouri illinoisindiana ohio wisconsin and iowa</s>  now i suppose it will not be deniedthat these thirteen states are a little more interested in improvements onthat great river than are the remaining seventeen</s>  these instances of thenavy and the mississippi river show clearly that there is something oflocal advantage in the most general objects</s>  but the converse is alsotrue</s>  nothing is so local as to not be of some general benefit</s>  takefor instance the illinois and michigan canal</s>  considered apart from itseffects it is perfectly local</s>  every inch of it is within the state ofillinois</s>  that canal was first opened for business last april</s>  in a veryfew days we were all gratified to learn among other things that sugarhad been carried from new orleans through this canal to buffalo in newyork</s>  this sugar took this route doubtless because it was cheaper thanthe old route</s>  supposing benefit of the reduction in the cost of carriageto be shared between seller and the buyer result is that the new orleansmerchant sold his sugar a little dearer and the people of buffalosweetened their coffee a little cheaper than beforea benefit resultingfrom the canal not to illinois where the canal is but to louisiana andnew york where it is not</s>  in other transactions illinois will of coursehave her share and perhaps the larger share too of the benefits of thecanal but this instance of the sugar clearly shows that the benefits ofan improvement are by no means confined to the particular locality ofthe improvement itself</s>  the just conclusion from all this is that if thenation refuse to make improvements of the more general kind because theirbenefits may be somewhat local a state may for the same reason refuse tomake an improvement of a local kind because its benefits may be somewhatgeneral</s>  a state may well say to the nation if you will do nothing forme i will do nothing for you</s>  thus it is seen that if this argument ofinequality is sufficient anywhere it is sufficient everywhere and putsan end to improvements altogether</s>  i hope and believe that if both thenation and the states would in good faith in their respective spheresdo what they could in the way of improvements what of inequality might beproduced in one place might be compensated in another and the sum of thewhole might not be very unequal</s> but suppose after all there should be some degree of inequality</s> inequality is certainly never to be embraced for its own sake but isevery good thing to be discarded which may be inseparably connected withsome degree of it</s>  if so we must discard all government</s>  this capitolis built at the public expense for the public benefit but does any onedoubt that it is of some peculiar local advantage to the propertyholdersand business people of washington</s>  shall we remove it for this reason</s> and if so where shall we set it down and be free from the difficulty</s> to make sure of our object shall we locate it nowhere and have congresshereafter to hold its sessions as the loafer lodged in spots about</s> i make no allusion to the present president when i say there are fewstronger cases in this world of burden to the many and benefit to thefew of inequality than the presidency itself is by some thought tobe</s>  an honest laborer digs coal at about seventy cents a day while thepresident digs abstractions at about seventy dollars a day</s>  the coalis clearly worth more than the abstractions and yet what a monstrousinequality in the prices</s>  does the president for this reason propose toabolish the presidency</s>  he does not and he ought not</s>  the true rule indetermining to embrace or reject anything is not whether it have any evilin it but whether it have more of evil than of good</s>  there are few thingswholly evil or wholly good</s>  almost everything especially of governmentpolicy is an inseparable compound of the two so that our best judgmentof the preponderance between them is continually demanded</s>  on thisprinciple the president his friends and the world generally act onmost subjects</s>  why not apply it then upon this question</s>  why as toimprovements magnify the evil and stoutly refuse to see any good inthem</s> mr</s>  chairman on the third position of the message the constitutionalquestioni have not much to say</s>  being the man i am and speaking wherei do i feel that in any attempt at an original constitutional argumenti should not be and ought not to be listened to patiently</s>  the ablest andthe best of men have gone over the whole ground long ago</s>  i shall attemptbut little more than a brief notice of what some of them have said</s>  inrelation to mr</s>  jeffersons views i read from mr</s>  polks veto messagepresident jefferson in his message to congress in 1806 recommended anamendment of the constitution with a view to apply an anticipated surplusin the treasury to the great purposes of the public education roadsrivers canals and such other objects of public improvement as it maybe thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of the federalpowers and he adds i suppose an amendment to the constitution byconsent of the states necessary because the objects now recommended arenot among those enumerated in the constitution and to which it permitsthe public moneys to be applied</s>  in 1825 he repeated in his publishedletters the opinion that no such power has been conferred upon congress</s> i introduce this not to controvert just now the constitutional opinionbut to show that on the question of expediency mr</s>  jeffersons opinionwas against the present president that this opinion of mr</s>  jeffersonin one branch at least is in the hands of mr</s>  polk like mcfingalsgunbears wide and kicks the owner over</s> but to the constitutional question</s>  in 1826 chancellor kent firstpublished his commentaries on american law</s>  he devoted a portion of one ofthe lectures to the question of the authority of congress to appropriatepublic moneys for internal improvements</s>  he mentions that the subject hadnever been brought under judicial consideration and proceeds to give abrief

power tillthe period of mr</s>  j</s> q</s>  adamss administration at which point he considersthe executive influence as withdrawn from opposition and added to thesupport of the power</s>
 in 1844 the chancellor published a new edition ofhis commentaries in which he adds some notes of what had transpired onthe question since 1826</s>  i have not time to read the original text onthe notes but the whole may be found on page 267 and the two or threefollowing pages of the first volume of the edition of 1844</s>  as to whatchancellor kent seems to consider the sum of the whole i read from one ofthe notesmr</s>  justice story in his commentaries on the constitution of the unitedstates vol</s>  ii</s>  pp</s>  429440 and again pp</s>

arguments as stated that every mind which hastaken no part in the discussion and felt no prejudice or territorial biason either side of the question would deem the arguments in favor of

question as this purelyis be at all compared or set in opposition to that of such a man insuch an attitude as chancellor kent</s>  this constitutional question willprobably never be better settled than it is until it shall pass underjudicial consideration but i do think no man who is clear on thequestions of expediency need feel his conscience much pricked upon this</s> mr</s>  chairman the president seems to think that enough may be done inthe way of improvements by means of tonnage duties under state authoritywith the consent of the general government</s>  now i suppose this matterof tonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere</s>  i suppose it may beefficient and perhaps sufficient to make slight improvements and repairsin harbors already in use and not much out of repair</s>  but if i have anycorrect general idea of it it must be wholly inefficient for any generalbeneficent purposes of improvement</s>  i know very little or rather nothingat all of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnageduties but i suppose one of its principles must be to lay a duty for theimprovement of any particular harbor upon the tonnage coming into thatharbor to do otherwiseto collect money in one harbor to be expendedon improvements in anotherwould be an extremely aggravated form of thatinequality which the president so much deprecates</s>  if i be right in thishow could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties</s> how make a road a canal or clear a greatly obstructed river</s>  the ideathat we could involves the same absurdity as the irish bull about the newboots</s>  i shall niver git em on says patrick till i wear em a dayor two and stretch em a little</s>  we shall never make a canal by tonnageduties until it shall already have been made awhile so the tonnage canget into it</s> after all the president concludes that possibly there may be some greatobjects of improvement which cannot be effected by tonnage duties andwhich it therefore may be expedient for the general government to takein hand</s>  accordingly he suggests in case any such be discovered thepropriety of amending the constitution</s>  amend it for what</s>  if likemr</s>  jefferson the president thought improvements expedient but notconstitutional it would be natural enough for him to recommend such anamendment</s>  but hear what he says in this very messagein view of these portentous consequences i cannot but think that thiscourse of legislation should be arrested even were there nothing toforbid it in the fundamental laws of our union</s> for what then would he have the constitution amended</s>  with him it is aproposition to remove one impediment merely to be met by others whichin his opinion cannot be removed to enable congress to do what in hisopinion they ought not to do if they could</s> here mr</s>  meade of virginia inquired if mr</s>  lincoln understood thepresident to be opposed on grounds of expediency to any and everyimprovement</s> mr</s>  lincoln answered in the very part of his message of which i amspeaking i understand him as giving some vague expression in favor ofsome possible objects of improvement but in doing so i understand himto be directly on the teeth of his own arguments in other parts of it</s> neither the president nor any one can possibly specify an improvementwhich shall not be clearly liable to one or another of the objections hehas urged on the score of expediency</s>  i have shown and might show againthat no workno objectcan be so general as to dispense its benefitswith precise equality and this inequality is chief among the portentousconsequences for which he declares that improvements should be arrested</s> no sir</s>  when the president intimates that something in the way ofimprovements may properly be done by the general government he isshrinking from the conclusions to which his own arguments would force him</s> he feels that the improvements of this broad and goodly land are a mightyinterest and he is unwilling to confess to the people or perhapsto himself that he has built an argument which when pressed to itsconclusions entirely annihilates this interest</s> i have already said that no one who is satisfied of the expediency ofmaking improvements needs be much uneasy in his conscience about itsconstitutionality</s>  i wish now to submit a few remarks on the generalproposition of amending the constitution</s>  as a general rule i think wewould much better let it alone</s>  no slight occasion should tempt us totouch it</s>  better not take the first step

arguments as well as i could and reduced them to the propositionsi have stated</s>  i have now examined them in detail</s>  i wish to detain thecommittee only a little while longer with some general remarks upon thesubject of improvements</s>  that the subject is a difficult one cannotbe denied</s>  still it is no more difficult in congress than in the statelegislatures in the counties or in the smallest municipal districtswhich anywhere exist</s>  all can recur to instances of this difficulty in thecase of county roads bridges and the like</s>  one man is offended becausea road passes over his land and another is offended because it does notpass over his one is dissatisfied because the bridge for which he istaxed crosses the river on a different road from that which leads from hishouse to town another cannot bear that the county should be got in debtfor these same roads and bridges while not a few struggle hard to haveroads located over their lands and then stoutly refuse to let them beopened until they are first paid the damages</s>  even between the differentwards and streets of towns and cities we find this same wrangling anddifficulty</s>  now these are no other than the very difficulties againstwhich and out of which the president constructs his objections ofinequality speculation and crushing the treasury</s>  there is but asingle alternative about them they are sufficient or they are not</s>  ifsufficient they are sufficient out of congress as well as in it andthere is the end</s>  we must reject them as insufficient or lie down and donothing by any

clear this difficulty let ushave that same statistical information which the gentleman from ohio mr</s> vinton suggested at the beginning of this session</s>  in that information weshall have a stern unbending basis of factsa basis in no wise subjectto whim caprice or local interest</s>  the prelimited amount of means willsave us from doing too much and the statistics will save us from doingwhat

would allow them to have improvements which their owncandidate if elected will not</s> mr</s>  speaker i have said general taylors position is as well defined asis that of general cass</s>  in saying

know to be against the extension of slavery</s>  as suchand with what information i have i hope and believe general taylor ifelected would not veto the proviso</s>  but i do not know it</s>  yet if iknew he would i still would vote for him</s>  i should do so because in myjudgment his election alone can defeat general cass and becauseshould slavery thereby go to the territory we now have just so

thamesand as you said in 1840 harrison was picking huckleberries two miles offwhile the battle was fought i suppose it is a just conclusion with youto say cass was aiding harrison to pick huckleberries</s>  this is about allexcept the mooted question of the broken sword</s>  some authors say he brokeit some say he threw it away and some others who ought to know saynothing about it</s>  perhaps it would be a fair historical compromise to sayif he did not break it he did not do anything else with it</s> by the way mr</s>  speaker did you know i am a military hero</s>  yes sir inthe days of the black hawk war i fought bled and came away</s>  speakingof general casss career reminds me of my own</s>  i was not at stilimansdefeat but i was about as near it as cass was to hulls

his sword the idea is he broke itin desperation i bent the musket by accident</s>  if general cass went inadvance of me in picking huckleberries i guess i surpassed him in chargesupon the wild onions</s>  if he saw any live fighting indians it was morethan i did but i had a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoesand although i never fainted from the loss of blood i can truly say i wasoften very hungry</s>  mr</s>  speaker if i should ever conclude to doff whateverour democratic friends may suppose there is of blackcockade federalismabout me and therefore they shall take me up as their candidate forthe presidency i protest they shall not make fun of me as they have ofgeneral cass by attempting to write me into a military hero</s> while i have general cass in hand i wish to say a word about hispolitical principles</s>  as a specimen i take the record of his progress inthe wilmot proviso</s>  in the washington union of march 2 1847 there is areport of a speech of general

great surprise at the change in the sentimentsof the senator from michigan who had been regarded as the great championof freedom in the northwest of which he was a distinguished ornament</s> last year

then and that indecember 1847 he was against it altogether</s>  this is a true index to thewhole man</s>  when the question was raised in 1846 he was in a blusteringhurry to take ground for it</s>  he sought to be in advance and to avoidthe uninteresting position of a mere follower but soon he began to seeglimpses of the great democratic oxgoad waving in his face and to hearindistinctly a voice

general cass is ageneral of splendidly successful chargescharges to be sure notupon the public enemy but upon the public treasury</s>
 he was governor ofmichigan territory and exofficio superintendent of indian affairsfrom the 9th of october 1813 till the 31st of july 1831a period ofseventeen years nine months and twentytwo days</s>  during this periodhe received from the united states treasury for personal services andpersonal expenses the aggregate sum of ninetysix thousand and twentyeight dollars being an average of fourteen dollars and seventynine centsper day for every day of the time</s>  this large sum was reached by assumingthat he was doing service at several different places and in severaldifferent capacities in the same place all at the same time</s>  by a correctanalysis of his accounts during that period the following propositionsmay be deducedfirst</s>  he was paid in three different capacities during the whole of thetime that is to say1 as governor a salary at the rate per yearof 2000</s>  2 as estimated for office rent clerk hire fuel etc</s>  insuperintendence of indian affairs in michigan at the rate per year of1500</s>  3 as compensation and expenses for various miscellaneous items ofindian service out of michigan an average per year of 625</s> second</s>  during part of the timethat is from the 9th of october 1813to the 29th of may 1822 he was paid in four different capacities that isto say the three as above and in addition thereto the commutation often rations per day amounting per year to 730</s> third</s>  during another part of the timethat is from the beginningof 1822 to the 31st of july 83 he was also paid in four differentcapacities that is to say the first three as above the rations beingdropped after the 29th of may 1822 and in addition thereto forsuperintending indian agencies at piqua ohio fort wayne indiana andchicago illinois at the rate per year of 1500</s>  it should be observedhere that the last item commencing at the beginning of 1822 and the itemof rations ending on the 29th of may 1822 lap on each other during somuch of the time as lies between those two dates</s> fourth</s>  still another part of the timethat is from the 31st of october1821 to the 29th of may 1822he was paid in six different capacitiesthat is to say the three first as above the item of rations as aboveand in addition thereto another item of ten rations per day while atwashington settling his accounts being at the rate per year of 730 andalso an allowance for expenses traveling to and from washington and whilethere of 1022 being at the rate per year of 1793</s> fifth</s>  and yet during the little portion of the time which lies betweenthe 1st of january 1822 and the 29th of may 1822 he was paid in sevendifferent capacities that is to say the six last mentioned and alsoat the rate of 1500 per year for the piqua fort wayne and chicagoservice as mentioned above</s>
these accounts have already been discussed some here but when we areamongst them as when we are in the patent office we must peep about agood deal before we can see all the curiosities</s>  i shall not be tediouswith them</s>  as to the large item of 1500 per yearamounting in theaggregate to 26715 for office rent clerk hire fuel etc</s>  i barelywish to remark that so far as i can discover in the public documentsthere is no evidence by word or inference either from any disinterestedwitness or of general cass himself that he ever rented or kept a separateoffice ever hired or kept a clerk or even used any extra amount of fueletc</s>  in consequence of his indian services</s>  indeed general casss entiresilence in regard to these items in his two long letters urging hisclaims upon the government is to my mind almost conclusive that no suchclaims had any real existence</s> but i have introduced general casss accounts here chiefly to show thewonderful physical capacities of the man</s>  they show that he not only didthe labor of several men at the same time but that he often did it atseveral places many hundreds of miles apart at the same time</s>  and ateating too his capacities are shown to be quite as wonderful</s>  fromoctober 1821 to may 1822 he eat ten rations a day in michigan tenrations a day here in washington and near five dollars worth a day onthe road between the two places</s>  and then there is an important discoveryin his examplethe art of being paid for what one eats instead of havingto pay for it</s>  hereafter if any nice young man should owe a bill whichhe cannot pay in any other way he can just board it out</s>  mr</s>  speaker wehave all heard of the animal standing in doubt between two stacks of hayand starving to death</s>  the like of that would never happen to generalcass</s>  place the stacks a thousand miles apart he would stand stockstillmidway between them and eat them both at once and the green grass alongthe line would be apt to suffer some too at the same time</s>  by all meansmake him president gentlemen</s>  he will feed you bounteouslyifif thereis any left after he shall have helped himself</s> but as general taylor is par excellence the hero of the mexican warand as you democrats say we whigs have always opposed the war you thinkit must be very awkward and embarrassing for us to go for general taylor</s> the declaration that we have always opposed the war is true or falseaccording as one may understand the term oppose the war</s>  if to say thewar was unnecessarily and unconstitutionally commenced by the presidentby opposing the war then the whigs have very generally opposed it</s> whenever they have spoken at all they have said this and they have saidit on what has appeared good reason to them</s>  the marching an army into themidst of a peaceful mexican settlement frightening the inhabitants awayleaving their growing crops and other property to destruction to you mayappear a perfectly amiable peaceful unprovoking procedure but it doesnot appear so to us</s>  so to call such an act to us appears no other thana naked impudent absurdity and we speak of it accordingly</s>  but if whenthe war had begun and had become the cause of the country the givingof our money and our blood in common with yours was support of thewar then it is not true that we have always opposed the war</s>  with fewindividual exceptions you have constantly had our votes here for all thenecessary supplies</s>  and more than this you have had the services theblood and the lives of our political

bloodybreathless struggle at buena vista where each mans hard task was to beatback five foes or die himself of the five high officers who perishedfour were whigs</s> in speaking of this i mean no odious comparison between the lionheartedwhigs and the democrats who fought there</s>  on other occasions andamong the lower officers and privates on that occasion i doubt not theproportion was different</s>  i wish to do justice to all</s>  i think of allthose brave men as americans in whose proud fame as an american i toohave a share</s>  many of them whigs and democrats are my constituents andpersonal friends and i thank themmore than thank themone and allfor the high imperishable honor they have conferred on our common state</s> but the distinction between the cause of the president in beginning thewar and the cause of the country after it was begun is a distinctionwhich you cannot perceive</s>  to you the president and the country seem tobe all one</s>  you are interested to see no distinction between them and iventure to suggest that probably your interest blinds you a little</s>  wesee the distinction as we think clearly enough and our friends who havefought in the war have no difficulty in seeing it also</s>  what those whohave fallen would say were they alive and here of course we can neverknow but with those who have returned there is no difficulty</s>  colonelhaskell and major gaines members here both fought in the war and bothof them underwent extraordinary perils and hardships still they like allother whigs here vote on the record that the war was unnecessarily andunconstitutionally commenced by the president</s>  and even general taylorhimself the noblest roman of them all has declared that as a citizenand particularly as a soldier it is sufficient for him to know that hiscountry is at war with a foreign nation to do all in his power tobring it to a speedy and honorable termination by the most vigorous andenergetic operations without inquiry about its justice or anything elseconnected with it</s> mr</s>  speaker let our democratic friends be comforted with the assurancethat we are content with our position

arguments and brilliant illustrationsonlyinterrupted by warm and frequent applause</s>  he began by expressing a realfeeling of modesty in addressing an audience this side of the mountainsa part of the country where in the opinion of the people of his sectioneverybody was supposed to be instructed and wise</s>  but he had devoted hisattention to the question of the coming presidential election and wasnot unwilling to exchange with all whom he might the ideas to which hehad arrived</s>  he then began to show the fallacy of some of the argumentsagainst gen</s>  taylor making his chief theme the fashionable statement ofall those who oppose him the old locofocos as well as the new that hehas no principles and that the whig party have abandoned their principlesby adopting him as their candidate</s>  he maintained that gen</s>  tayloroccupied a high and unexceptionable whig ground and took for his firstinstance and proof of this the statement in the allison letterwithregard to the bank tariff rivers and harbors etc</s> that the will of thepeople should produce its own results without executive influence</s>  theprinciple that the people should do whatunder the constitutionas theyplease is a whig principle</s>  all that gen</s>  taylor is not only to consentto but appeal to the people to judge and act for themselves</s>  and this wasno new doctrine for whigs</s>  it was the platform on which they hadfought all their battles the resistance of executive influence and theprinciple of enabling the people to frame the government according totheir will</s>  gen</s>  taylor consents to be the candidate and to assist thepeople to do what they think to be their duty and think to be best intheir national affairs but because he dont want to tell what we ought todo he is accused of having no principles</s>  the whigs here maintained foryears that neither the influence the duress or the prohibition of theexecutive should control the legitimately expressed will of the peopleand now that on that very ground gen</s>  taylor says that he should use thepower given him by the people to do to the best of his judgment the willof the people he is accused of want of principle and of inconsistency inposition</s> mr</s>  lincoln proceeded to examine the absurdity of an attempt to make aplatform or creed for a national party to all parts of which allmust consent and agree when it was clearly the intention and the truephilosophy of our government that in congress all opinions and principlesshould be represented and that when the wisdom of all had been comparedand united the will of the majority should be carried out</s>  on this groundhe conceived and the audience seemed to go with him that gen</s>  taylorheld correct sound republican principles</s> mr</s>  lincoln then passed to the subject of slavery in the statessaying that the people of illinois agreed entirely with the people ofmassachusetts on this subject except perhaps that they did not keep soconstantly thinking about it</s>  all agreed that slavery was an evil butthat we were not responsible for it and cannot affect it in states of thisunion where we do not live</s>  but the question of the extension of slaveryto new territories of this country is a part of our responsibility andcare and is under our control</s>  in opposition to this mr</s>  l</s>  believed thatthe selfnamed free soil party was far behind the whigs</s>  both partiesopposed the extension</s>  as he understood it the new party had no principleexcept this opposition</s>  if their platform held any other it was in sucha general way that it was like the pair of pantaloons the yankee pedlaroffered for sale large enough for any man small enough for any boy</s> they therefore had taken a position calculated to break down their singleimportant declared object</s>  they were working for the election of eithergen</s>  cass or gen</s>  taylor</s>  the speaker then went on to show clearly andeloquently the danger of extension of slavery likely to result from theelection of gen</s>  cass</s>  to unite with those who annexed the new territoryto prevent the extension of slavery in that territory seemed to him tobe in the highest degree absurd and ridiculous</s>  suppose these gentlemensucceed in electing mr</s>  van buren they had no specific means to preventthe extension of slavery to new mexico and california and gen</s>  taylor heconfidently believed would not encourage it and would not prohibit itsrestriction</s>  but if gen</s>  cass was elected he felt certain that the plansof farther extension of territory would be encouraged and those of theextension of slavery would meet no check</s>  the free soil mart in claimingthat name indirectly attempts a deception by implying that whigs werenot free soil men</s>  declaring that they would do their duty and leave theconsequences to god merely gave an excuse for taking a course they werenot able to maintain by a fair and full argument</s>  to make this declarationdid not show what their duty was</s>  if it did we should have no use forjudgment we might as well be made without intellect and when divine orhuman law does not clearly point out what is our duty we have no means offinding out what it is but by using our most intelligent judgment of theconsequences</s>  if there were divine law or human law for voting for martinvan buren or if a fair examination of the consequences and just reasoningwould show that voting for him would bring about the ends they pretendedto wishthen he would give up the argument</s>  but since there was no fixedlaw on the subject and since the whole probable result of their actionwould be an assistance in electing gen</s>  cass he must say that they werebehind the whigs in their advocacy of the freedom of the soil</s> mr</s>  lincoln proceeded to rally the buffalo convention for forbearing tosay anythingafter all the previous declarations of those members whowere formerly whigson the subject of the mexican war because the vanburens had been known to have supported it</s>  he declared that of all theparties asking the confidence of the country this new one had less

 lincoln said he had not risen for the purpose of making a speech butonly for the purpose of meeting some of the objections to the bill</s>  if heunderstood those objections the first was that if the bill were to becomea law it would be used to lock large portions of the public lands fromsale without at last effecting the ostensible object of the billtheconstruction of railroads in the new states and secondly that congresswould be forced to the abandonment of large portions of the public landsto the states for which they might be reserved without their paying forthem</s>  this he understood to be the substance of the objections of thegentleman from ohio to the passage of the bill</s> if he could get the attention of the house for a few minutes he would askgentlemen to tell us what motive could induce any state legislature orindividual or company of individuals of the new states to expend moneyin surveying roads which they might know they could not make</s> a voice they are not required to make the road</s> mr</s>  lincoln continued that was not the case he was making</s>  what motivewould tempt any set of men to go into an extensive survey of a railroadwhich they did not intend to make</s>  what good would it do</s>  did men actwithout motive</s>  did business men commonly go into an expenditure of moneywhich could be of no account to them</s>  he generally found that men who havemoney were disposed to hold on to it unless they could see something tobe made by its investment</s>  he could not see what motive of advantage tothe new states could be subserved by merely keeping the public lands outof market and preventing their settlement</s>  as far as he could see thenew states were wholly without any motive to do such a thing</s>  this thenhe took to be a good answer to the first objection</s> in relation to the fact assumed that after a while the new states havinggot hold of the public lands to a certain extent they would turn roundand compel congress to relinquish all claim to them he had a word to sayby way of recurring to the history of the past</s>  when was the time to comehe asked when the states in which the public lands were situated

example</s>  he was referring to a plain principlein the nature of things</s>  the state of ohio had now grown to be a giant</s> she had a large delegation on that floor but was she now in favor ofgranting lands to the new states as she used to be</s>  the new englandstates new york and the old thirteen were all rather quiet upon thesubject and it was seen just now that a member from one of the new stateswas the first man to rise up in opposition</s>  and such would be with thehistory of this question for the future</s>  there never would come a timewhen the people residing in the states embracing the public lands wouldhave the entire control of this subject and so it was a matter ofcertainty that congress would never do more in this respect than whatwould be dictated by a just

 in his twentythirdyear mr</s>  clay was licensed to practise law and emigrated to lexingtonkentucky</s>  here he commenced and continued the practice till the year1803 when he was first elected to the kentucky legislature</s>  by successiveelections he was continued in the legislature till the latter part of1806 when he was elected to fill a vacancy of a single session in theunited states senate</s>  in 1807 he was again elected to the kentucky houseof representatives and by that body chosen speaker</s>  in 1808 he wasreelected to the same body</s>  in 1809 he was again chosen to fill a vacancyof two years in the united states senate</s>  in 1811 he was elected to theunited states house of representatives and on the first day of taking hisseat in that body he was chosen its speaker</s>  in 1813 he was again electedspeaker</s>  early in 1814 being the period of our last british war mr</s>  claywas sent as commissioner with others to negotiate a treaty of peacewhich treaty was concluded in the latter part of the same year</s>  on hisreturn from europe he was again elected to the lower branch of congressand on taking his seat in december 1815 was called to his old postthespeakers chair a position in which he was retained by successiveelections with one brief intermission till the inauguration of johnquincy adams in march 1825</s>  he was then appointed secretary of stateand occupied that important station till the inauguration of generaljackson in march 1829</s>  after this he returned to kentucky resumed thepractice of law and continued it till the autumn of 1831 when he was bythe legislature of kentucky again placed in the united states senate</s>  bya reelection he was continued in the senate till he resigned his seat andretired in march 1848</s>  in december 1849 he again took his seat in thesenate which he again resigned only a few months before his death</s> by the foregoing it is perceived that the period from the beginning of mr</s> clays official life in 1803 to the end of 1852 is but one year shortof half a century and that the sum of all the intervals in it will notamount to ten years</s>  but mere duration of time in office constitutes thesmallest part of mr</s>

inall the great questions which have agitated the country and particularlyin those fearful crises the missouri question the nullificationquestion and the late slavery question as connected with the newlyacquired territory involving and endangering the stability of the unionhis has been the leading and most conspicuous part</s>  in 1824 he was firsta candidate for the presidency and was defeated and although he wassuccessively defeated for the same office in 1832 and in 1844 there hasnever been a moment since 1824 till after 1848 when a very large portionof the american people did not cling to him with an enthusiastic hope andpurpose of still elevating him to the presidency</s>  with other men tobe defeated was to be forgotten but with him defeat was but a triflingincident neither

many eloquent men fail utterly and they arenot as a class generally successful</s>  his judgment was excellentbut many men of good judgment live and die unnoticed</s>  his will wasindomitable but this quality often secures to its owner nothing betterthan a character for useless obstinacy</s>  these then were mr</s>  claysleading qualities</s>  no one of them is very uncommon but all together arerarely combined in a single individual and this is probably the reasonwhy such men as henry clay are so rare in the world</s> mr</s>  clays eloquence did not consist as many fine specimens of eloquencedo of types and figures of antithesis and elegant arrangement of wordsand sentences but rather of that deeply earnest and impassioned toneand manner which can proceed only from great

devotionto the cause of human libertya strong sympathy with the oppressedeverywhere and an ardent wish for their elevation</s>  with him this was aprimary and allcontrolling passion</s>  subsidiary to this was the conductof his whole life</s>  he loved his country partly because it was his owncountry and mostly because it was a free country and he burned with azeal for its advancement prosperity

half century the wisdom of his course on many is doubted anddenied by a large portion of his countrymen and of such it is not nowproper to speak particularly</s>  but there are many others about his courseupon which there is little or no disagreement amongst intelligent andpatriotic americans</s>  of these last are the war of 1812 the missouriquestion nullification and the now recent compromise

thecause of the injured sailor that it invoked the genius of the revolutionthat it apostrophized the names of otis of henry and of washington thatit appealed to the interests the pride the honor and the glory ofthe nation that it shamed and taunted the timidity of friends that itscorned and scouted and withered the temerity of domestic foes thatit bearded and defied the british lion and rising and swelling andmaddening in its course it sounded the onset till the charge the shockthe steady struggle and the glorious victory all passed in vivid reviewbefore the entranced hearers</s> important and exciting as was the war question of 1812 it never soalarmed the sagacious statesmen of the country for the safety of therepublic as afterward did the missouri question</s>  this sprang fromthat unfortunate source of discordnegro slavery</s>  when our federalconstitution was adopted we owned no territory beyond the limits orownership of the states except the territory northwest of the river ohioand east of the mississippi</s>  what has since been formed into the statesof maine kentucky and tennessee was i believe within the limits ofor owned by massachusetts virginia and north carolina</s>  as to thenorthwestern territory provision had been made even before the adoptionof the constitution that slavery should never go there</s>  on the admissionof states into the union carved from the territory we owned before theconstitution no question or at most no considerable question aroseabout slaverythose which were within the limits of or owned by the oldstates following respectively the condition of the parent state and thosewithin the northwest territory following the previously made provision</s> but in 1803 we purchased louisiana of the french and it included withmuch more what has since been formed into the state of missouri</s>  withregard to it nothing had been done to forestall the question of slavery</s> when therefore in 1819 missouri having formed a state constitutionwithout excluding slavery and with slavery already actually existingwithin its limits knocked at the door of the union for admission almostthe entire representation of the nonslaveholding states objected</s>  afearful and angry struggle instantly followed</s>  this alarmed thinkingmen more than any previous question because unlike all the formerit divided the country by geographical lines</s>  other questions had theiropposing partisans in all localities of the country and in almost everyfamily so that no division of the union could follow such without aseparation of

appealed to by members to renew his efforts atcompromise</s>  he did so and by some judicious modifications of his plancoupled with laborious efforts with individual members and his ownovermastering eloquence upon that floor he finally secured the admissionof the state</s>  brightly and captivating as it had previously shown it wasnow perceived that his great eloquence was a mere embellishment or

people have differed with mr</s>  clay and a majority evenappear generally to have been opposed to him on questions of ordinaryadministration he seems constantly to have been regarded by all as theman

clays efforts in behalf of the south americans and afterward inbehalf of the greeks in the times of their respective struggles for civilliberty are among the finest on record upon the noblest of all

i take ground which others havethought or may think narrow sectional and dangerous to the union ihope to give a reason which will appear sufficient at least to some whyi think differently</s> and as this subject is no other than part and parcel of the larger generalquestion of domestic slavery i wish to make and to keep the distinctionbetween the existing institution and the extension of it so broad andso clear that no honest man can misunderstand me and no dishonest onesuccessfully misrepresent me</s> in order to a clear understanding of what the missouri compromise is ashort history of the preceding kindred subjects will perhaps be proper</s> when we established our independence we did not own or claim thecountry to which this compromise applies</s>  indeed strictly speaking theconfederacy then owned no country at all the states respectively ownedthe country within their limits and some of them owned territorybeyond their strict state limits</s>  virginia thus owned the northwesternterritorythe country out of which the principal part of ohio allindiana all illinois all michigan and all wisconsin have since beenformed</s>  she also owned perhaps within her then limits what has sincebeen formed into the state of kentucky</s>  north carolina thus owned whatis now the state of tennessee and south carolina and georgia ownedin separate parts what are now mississippi and alabama</s>  connecticut ithink owned the little remaining part of ohio being the same where theynow send giddings to congress and beat all creation in making cheese</s> these territories together with the states themselves constitute all thecountry over which the confederacy then claimed any sort of jurisdiction</s> we were then living under the articles of confederation which weresuperseded by the constitution several years afterward</s>  the question ofceding the territories to the general government was set on foot</s>  mr</s> jeffersonthe author of the declaration of independence and otherwisea chief actor in the revolution then a delegate in congress afterwardtwice president who was is and perhaps will continue to be themost distinguished politician of our history a virginian by birth andcontinued residence and withal a slaveholderconceived the idea oftaking that occasion to prevent slavery ever going into the northwesternterritory</s>  he prevailed on the virginia legislature to adopt his viewsand to cede the territory making the prohibition of slavery thereina condition of the deed</s>  jefferson got only an understanding not acondition of the deed to this wish</s>  congress accepted the cession withthe condition and the first ordinance which the acts of congress werethen called for the government of the territory provided that slaveryshould never be permitted therein</s>  this is the famed ordinance of 87so often spoken of</s> thenceforward for sixtyone years and until in 1848 the last scrap ofthis territory came into the union as the state of wisconsin all partiesacted in quiet obedience to this ordinance</s>  it is now what jeffersonforesaw and intendedthe happy home of teeming millions of free whiteprosperous people and no slave among them</s> thus with the author of the declaration of independence the policy ofprohibiting slavery in new territory originated</s>  thus away back to theconstitution in the pure fresh free breath of the revolution the stateof virginia and the national congress put that policy into practice</s>  thusthrough more than sixty of the best years of the republic did that policysteadily work to its great and beneficent end</s>  and thus in those fivestates and in five millions of free enterprising people we have beforeus the rich fruits of this policy</s> but now new light breaks upon us</s>  now congress declares this ought neverto have been and the like of it must never be again</s>  the sacred right ofselfgovernment is grossly violated by it</s>  we even find some men who drewtheir first breathand every other breath of their livesunder this veryrestriction now live in dread of absolute suffocation if they shouldbe restricted in the sacred right of taking slaves to nebraska</s>  thatperfect liberty they sigh forthe liberty of making slaves of otherpeople jefferson never thought of their own fathers never thought ofthey never thought of themselves a year ago</s>  how fortunate for them theydid not sooner become sensible of their great misery</s>  oh how difficult itis to treat with respect such assaults upon all we have ever really heldsacred</s> but to return to history</s>  in 1803 we purchased what was then calledlouisiana of france</s>  it included the present states of louisianaarkansas missouri and iowa also the territory of minnesota and thepresent bone of contention kansas and nebraska</s>  slavery already existedamong the french at new orleans and to some extent at st</s>  louis</s>  in 1812louisiana came into the union as a slave state without controversy</s>  in1818 or 19 missouri showed signs of a wish to come in with slavery</s>  thiswas resisted by northern members of congress and thus began the firstgreat slavery agitation in the nation</s>  this controversy lasted severalmonths and became very angry and excitingthe house of representativesvoting steadily for the prohibition of slavery in missouri and the senatevoting as steadily against it</s>  threats of the breaking up of the unionwere freely made and the ablest public men of the day became seriouslyalarmed</s>  at length a compromise was made in which as in all compromisesboth sides yielded something</s>  it was a law passed on the 6th of march1820 providing that missouri might come into the union with slavery butthat in all the remaining part of the territory purchased of francewhich lies north of thirtysix degrees and thirty minutes north latitudeslavery should never be permitted</s>  this provision of law is the missouricompromise</s>  in excluding slavery north of the line the same languageis employed as in the ordinance of 1787</s>  it directly applied to iowaminnesota and to the present bone of contention kansas and nebraska</s> whether there should or should not be slavery south of that line nothingwas said in the law</s>  but arkansas constituted the principal remainingpart south of the line and it has since been admitted as a slave statewithout serious controversy</s>  more recently iowa north of the line camein as a free state without controversy</s>  still later minnesota northof the line had a territorial organization without controversy</s>  texasprincipally south of the line and west of arkansas though originallywithin the purchase from france had in 1819 been traded off to spainin our treaty for the acquisition of florida</s>  it had thus become a partof mexico</s>  mexico revolutionized and became independent of spain</s>  americancitizens began settling rapidly with their slaves in the southern partof texas</s>  soon they revolutionized against mexico and established anindependent government of their own adopting a constitution with slaverystrongly resembling the constitutions of our slave states</s>  by stillanother rapid move texas claiming a boundary much farther west than whenwe parted with her in 1819 was brought back to the united states andadmitted into the union as a slave state</s>  then there was little or nosettlement in the northern part of texas a considerable portion of whichlay north of the missouri line and in the resolutions admitting her intothe union the missouri restriction was expressly extended westward acrossher territory</s>  this was in 1845 only nine years ago</s> thus originated the missouri compromise and thus has it been respecteddown to 1845</s>  and even four years later in 1849 our distinguishedsenator in a public address held the following language in relation toitthe missouri compromise has been in practical operation for about aquarter of a century and has received the sanction and approbation of menof all parties in every section of the union</s>  it has allayed all sectionaljealousies and irritations growing out of this vexed question andharmonized and tranquillized the whole country</s>  it has given to henryclay as its prominent champion the proud sobriquet of the greatpacificator and by that title and for that service his politicalfriends had repeatedly appealed to the people to rally under his standardas a presidential candidate as the man who had exhibited the patriotismand power to suppress an unholy and treasonable agitation and preservethe union</s>  he was not aware that any man or any party from any sectionof the union had ever urged as an objection to mr</s>  clay that he was thegreat champion of the missouri compromise</s>  on the contrary the effort wasmade by the opponents of mr</s>  clay to prove that he was not entitled to theexclusive merit of that great patriotic measure and that the honor wasequally due to others as well as to him for securing its adoptionthat it had its origin in the hearts of all patriotic men who desiredto preserve and perpetuate the blessings of our glorious unionan originakin to that of the constitution of the united states conceived in thesame spirit of fraternal affection and calculated to remove forever theonly danger which seemed to threaten at some distant day to sever thesocial bond of union</s>  all the evidences of public opinion at that dayseemed to indicate that this compromise had been canonized in the heartsof the american people as a sacred thing which no ruthless hand wouldever be reckless enough to disturb</s> i do not read this extract to involve judge douglas in an inconsistency</s> if he afterward thought he had been wrong it was right for him to change</s> i bring this forward merely to show the high estimate placed on themissouri compromise by all parties up to so late as the year 1849</s> but going back a little in point of time</s>  our war with mexico broke outin 1846</s>  when congress was about adjourning that session president polkasked them to place two millions of dollars under his control to be usedby him in the recess if found practicable and expedient in negotiatinga treaty of peace with mexico and acquiring some part of her territory</s>  abill was duly gotten up for the purpose and was progressing swimmingly inthe house of representatives when a member by the name of david wilmot ademocrat from pennsylvania moved as an amendment provided that in anyterritory thus acquired there never shall be slavery</s> this is the origin of the farfamed wilmot proviso</s>  it created a greatflutter but it stuck like wax was voted into the bill and the billpassed with it through the house</s>  the senate however adjourned withoutfinal action on it and so both appropriation and proviso were lost forthe time</s>  the war continued and at the next session the president renewedhis request for the appropriation enlarging the amount i think tothree millions</s>  again came the proviso and defeated the measure</s>  congressadjourned again and the war went on</s>  in december 1847 the new congressassembled</s>  i was in the lower house that term</s>  the wilmot proviso or theprinciple of it was constantly coming up in some shape or other and ithink i may venture to say i voted for it at least forty times duringthe short time i was there</s>  the senate however held it in check and itnever became a law</s>  in the spring of 1848 a treaty of peace was madewith mexico by which we obtained that portion of her country which nowconstitutes the territories of new mexico and utah and the present stateof california</s>  by this treaty the wilmot proviso was defeated in so faras it was intended to be a condition of the acquisition of territory</s> its friends however were still determined to find some way to restrainslavery from getting into the new country</s>  this new acquisition laydirectly west of our old purchase from france and extended west to thepacific ocean and was so situated that if the missouri line should beextended straight west the new country would be divided by such extendedline leaving some north and some south of it</s>  on judge douglass motiona bill or provision of a bill passed the senate to so extend themissouri line</s>  the proviso men in the house including myself voted itdown because by implication it gave up the southern part to slaverywhile we were bent on having it all free</s> in the fall of 1848 the goldmines were discovered in california</s>  thisattracted people to it with unprecedented rapidity so that on or soonafter the meeting of the new congress in december 1849 she already hada population of nearly a hundred thousand had called a convention formeda state constitution excluding slavery and was knocking for admissioninto the union</s>  the proviso men of course were for letting her inbut the senate always true to the other side would not consent to heradmission and there california stood kept out of the union becauseshe would not let slavery into her borders</s>  under all the circumstancesperhaps this was not wrong</s>  there were other points of dispute connectedwith the general question of slavery which equally needed adjustment</s>  thesouth clamored for a more efficient fugitive slave law</s>  the north clamoredfor the abolition of a peculiar species of slave trade in the districtof columbia in connection with which in view from the windows of thecapitol a sort of negro liverystable where droves of negroes werecollected temporarily kept and finally taken to southern marketsprecisely like droves of horses had been openly maintained for fiftyyears</s>  utah and new mexico needed territorial governments and whetherslavery should or should not be prohibited within them was anotherquestion</s>  the indefinite western boundary of texas was to be settled</s>  shewas a slave state and consequently the farther west the slavery men couldpush her boundary the more slave country they secured and the farthereast the slavery opponents could thrust the boundary back the less slaveground was secured</s>  thus this was just as clearly a slavery question asany of the others</s> these points all needed adjustment and they were held up perhaps wiselyto make them help adjust one another</s>  the union now as in 1820 wasthought to be in danger and devotion to the union rightfully inclinedmen to yield somewhat in points where nothing else could have so inclinedthem</s>  a compromise was finally effected</s>  the south got their new fugitiveslave law and the north got california by far the best part of ouracquisition from mexico as a free state</s>  the south got a provision thatnew mexico and utah when admitted as states may come in with or withoutslavery as they may then choose and the north got the slave tradeabolished in the district of columbia</s> </s>  the north got the western boundaryof texas thrown farther back eastward than the south desired but inturn they gave texas ten millions of dollars with which to pay her olddebts</s>  this is the compromise of 1850</s> preceding the presidential election of 1852 each of the great politicalparties democrats and whigs met in convention and adopted resolutionsindorsing the compromise of 50 as a finality a final settlement sofar as these parties could make it so of all slavery agitation</s>  previousto this in 1851 the illinois legislature had indorsed it</s> during this long period of time nebraska the nebraska territory notthe state of as we know it now had remained substantially an uninhabitedcountry but now emigration to and settlement within it began to takeplace</s>  it is about one third as large as the present united statesand its importance so long overlooked begins to come into view</s>  therestriction of slavery by the missouri compromise directly applies toitin fact was first made and has since been maintained expressly forit</s>  in 1853 a bill to give it a territorial government passed the houseof representatives and in the hands of judge douglas failed of passingonly for want of time</s>  this bill contained no repeal of the missouricompromise</s>  indeed when it was assailed because it did not contain suchrepeal judge douglas defended it in its existing form</s>  on january 41854 judge douglas introduces a new bill to give nebraska territorialgovernment</s>  he accompanies this bill with a report in which last heexpressly recommends that the missouri compromise shall neither beaffirmed nor repealed</s>  before long the bill is so modified as to make twoterritories instead of one calling the southern one kansas</s> also about a month after the introduction of the bill on the judges ownmotion it is so amended as to declare the missouri compromise inoperativeand void and substantially that the people who go and settle there mayestablish slavery or exclude it as they may see fit</s>  in this shape thebill passed both branches of congress and became a law</s> this is the repeal of the missouri compromise</s>  the foregoing historymay not be precisely accurate in every particular but i am sure it issufficiently so for all the use i shall attempt to make of it and init we have before us the chief material enabling us to judge correctlywhether the repeal of the missouri compromise is right or wrong</s>  i thinkand shall try to show that it is wrongwrong in its direct effectletting slavery into kansas and nebraska and wrong in its prospectiveprinciple allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide worldwhere men can be found inclined to take it</s> this declared indifference but as i must think covert real zealfor the spread of slavery i cannot but hate</s>  i hate it because of themonstrous injustice of slavery itself</s>  i hate it because it deprives ourrepublican example of its just influence in the world enables the enemiesof free institutions with plausibility to taunt us as hypocrites causesthe real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity and especially becauseit forces so many good men among ourselves into an open war with the veryfundamental principles of civil liberty criticizing the declaration ofindependence and insisting that there is no right principle of action butselfinterest</s> before proceeding let me say that i think i have no prejudice against thesouthern people</s>  they are just what we would be in their situation</s>  ifslavery did not now exist among them they would not introduce it</s>  if itdid now exist among us we should not instantly give it up</s>  this i believeof the masses north and south</s>  doubtless there are individuals on bothsides who would not hold slaves under any circumstances and others whowould gladly introduce slavery anew if it were out of existence</s>  we knowthat some southern men do free their slaves go north and become tiptopabolitionists while some northern ones go south and become most cruelslave masters</s> when southern people tell us that they are no more responsible for theorigin of slavery than we are i acknowledge the fact</s>  when it is saidthat the institution exists and that it is very difficult to get rid ofit in any satisfactory way i can understand and appreciate the saying</s>  isurely will not blame them for not doing what i should not know how to domyself</s>  if all earthly power were given me i should not know what to doas to the existing institution</s>  my first impulse would be to free all theslaves and send them to liberia to their own native land</s>  but a momentsreflection would convince me that whatever of high hope as i thinkthere is there may be in this in the long run its sudden execution isimpossible</s>  if they were all landed there in a day they would all perishin the next ten days and there are not surplus shipping and surplus moneyenough to carry them there in many times ten days</s>  what then</s>  free themall and keep them among us as underlings</s>  is it quite certain that thisbetters their condition</s>  i think i would not hold one in slavery at anyrate yet the point is not clear enough for me to denounce people upon</s> what next</s>  free them and make them politically and socially our equals</s> my own feelings will not admit of this and if mine would we well knowthat those of the great mass of whites will not</s>  whether this feelingaccords with justice and sound judgment is not the sole question ifindeed it is any part of it</s>  a universal feeling whether well or illfounded cannot be safely disregarded</s>  we cannot then make them equals</s>  itdoes seem to me that systems of gradual emancipation might be adopted butfor their tardiness in this i will not undertake to judge our brethren ofthe south</s> when they remind us of their constitutional rights i acknowledgethemnot grudgingly but fully and fairly and i would give them anylegislation for the reclaiming of their fugitives which should not inits stringency be more likely to carry a free man into slavery than ourordinary criminal laws are to hang an innocent one</s> but all this to my judgment furnishes no more excuse for permittingslavery to go into our own free territory than it would for reviving theafrican slave trade by law</s>  the law which forbids the bringing of slavesfrom africa and that which has so long forbidden the taking of theminto nebraska can hardy be distinguished on any moral principle and therepeal of the former could find quite as plausible excuses as that of thelatter</s> the arguments by which the repeal of the missouri compromise is sought tobe justified are thesefirst</s>  that the nebraska country needed a territorial government</s> second</s>  that in various ways the public had repudiated that compromise anddemanded the repeal and therefore should not now complain of it</s>  and lastly that the repeal establishes a principle which isintrinsically right</s> i will attempt an answer to each of them in its turn</s> first then if that country was in need of a territorial organizationcould it not have had it as well without as with a repeal</s>  iowa andminnesota to both of which the missouri restriction applied had withoutits repeal each in succession territorial organizations</s>  and even theyear before a bill for nebraska itself was within an ace of passingwithout the repealing clause and this in the hands of the same men whoare now the champions of repeal</s>  why no necessity then for repeal</s>  butstill later when this very bill was first brought in it containedno repeal</s>  but say they because the people had demanded or rathercommanded the repeal the repeal was to accompany the organizationwhenever that should occur</s> now i deny that the public ever demanded any such thingever repudiatedthe missouri compromise ever commanded its repeal</s>  i deny it and callfor the proof</s>  it is not contended i believe that any such command hasever been given in express terms</s>  it is only said that it was done inprinciple</s>
 the support of the wilmot proviso is the first fact mentionedto prove that the missouri restriction was repudiated in principle andthe second is the refusal to extend the missouri line over the countryacquired from mexico</s>  these are near enough alike to be treated together</s> the one was to exclude the chances of slavery from the whole newacquisition by the lump and the other was to reject a division of it bywhich one half was to be given up to those chances</s>  now whether this wasa repudiation of the missouri line in principle depends upon whether themissouri law contained any principle requiring the line to be extendedover the country acquired from mexico</s>  i contend it did not</s>  i insistthat it contained no general principle but that it was in every sensespecific</s>  that its terms limit it to the country purchased from france isundenied and undeniable</s>  it could have no principle beyond the intentionof those who made it</s>  they did not intend to extend the line to countrywhich they did not own</s>  if they intended to extend it in the event ofacquiring additional territory why did they not say so</s>  it was just aseasy to say that in all the country west of the mississippi which we nowown or may hereafter acquire there shall never be slavery as to saywhat they did say and they would have said it if they had meant it</s>  anintention to extend the law is not only not mentioned in the law but isnot mentioned in any contemporaneous history</s>  both the law itself and thehistory of the times are a blank as to any principle of extension andby neither the known rules of construing statutes and contracts nor bycommon sense can any such principle be inferred</s> another fact showing the specific character of the missouri lawshowingthat it intended no more than it expressed showing that the line was notintended as a universal dividing line between free and slave territorypresent and prospective north of which slavery could never gois thefact that by that very law missouri came in as a slave state north of theline</s>  if that law contained any prospective principle the whole law mustbe looked to in order to ascertain what the principle was</s>  and by thisrule the south could fairly contend that inasmuch as they got one slavestate north of the line at the inception of the law they have the rightto have another given them north of it occasionally now and then in theindefinite westward extension of the line</s>  this demonstrates the absurdityof attempting to deduce a prospective principle from the missouricompromise line</s> when we voted for the wilmot proviso we were voting to keep slavery outof the whole mexican acquisition and little did we think we were therebyvoting to let it into nebraska lying several hundred miles distant</s>  whenwe voted against extending the missouri line little did we think we werevoting to destroy the old line then of near thirty years standing</s> to argue that we thus repudiated the missouri compromise is no less absurdthan it would be to argue that because we have so far forborne to acquirecuba we have thereby in principle repudiated our former acquisitionsand determined to throw them out of the union</s>  no less absurd than itwould be to say that because i may have refused to build an addition tomy house i thereby have decided to destroy the existing house</s>  and ifi catch you setting fire to my house you will turn upon me and say iinstructed you to do it</s> the most conclusive argument however that while for the wilmot provisoand while voting against the extension of the missouri line we neverthought of disturbing the original missouri compromise is found in thefact that there was then and still is an unorganized tract of finecountry nearly as large as the state of missouri lying immediately westof arkansas and south of the missouri compromise line and that we neverattempted to prohibit slavery as to it</s>  i wish particular attention tothis</s>  it adjoins the original missouri compromise line by its northernboundary and consequently is part of the country into which byimplication slavery was permitted to go by that compromise</s>  there it haslain open ever s and there it still lies and yet no effort has been madeat any time to wrest it from the south</s>  in all our struggles to prohibitslavery within our mexican acquisitions we never so much as lifted afinger to prohibit it as to this tract</s>  is not this entirely conclusivethat at all times we have held the missouri compromise as a sacred thingeven when against ourselves as well as when for us</s> senator douglas sometimes says the missouri line itself was in principleonly an extension of the line of the ordinance of 87that is to say anextension of the ohio river</s>
 i think this is weak enough on its face</s>  iwill remark however that as a glance at the map will show the missouriline is a long way farther south than the ohio and that if our senator inproposing his extension had stuck to the principle of jogging southwardperhaps it might not have been voted down so readily</s> but next it is said that the compromises of 50 and the ratification ofthem by both political parties in 52 established a new principle whichrequired the repeal of the missouri compromise</s>  this again i deny</s>  i denyit and demand the proof</s>  i have already stated fully what the compromisesof 50 are</s>  that particular part of those measures from which the virtualrepeal of the missouri compromise is sought to be inferred for it isadmitted they contain nothing about it in express terms is the provisionin the utah and new mexico laws which permits them when they seekadmission into the union as states to come in with or without slavery asthey shall then see fit</s>  now i insist this provision was made for utahand new mexico and for no other place whatever</s>  it had no more directreference to nebraska than it had to the territories of the moon</s>  butsay they it had reference to nebraska in principle</s>  let us see</s>  thenorth consented to this provision not because they considered it right initself but because they were compensatedpaid for it</s> they at the same time got california into the union as a free state</s>  thiswas far the best part of all they had struggled for by the wilmot proviso</s> they also got the area of slavery somewhat narrowed in the settlementof the boundary of texas</s>  also they got the slave trade abolished in thedistrict of columbia</s> for all these desirable objects the north could afford to yield somethingand they did yield to the south the utah and new mexico provision</s>  i donot mean that the whole north or even a majority yielded when the lawpassed but enough yieldedwhen added to the vote of the south tocarry the measure</s>  nor can it be pretended that the principle of thisarrangement requires us to permit the same provision to be applied tonebraska without any equivalent at all</s>  give us another free state pressthe boundary of texas still farther back give us another step toward thedestruction of slavery in the district and you present us a similar case</s> but ask us not to repeat for nothing what you paid for in the firstinstance</s>  if you wish the thing again pay again</s>  that is the principle ofthe compromises of 50 if indeed they had any principles beyond theirspecific termsit was the system of equivalents</s> again if congress at that time intended that all future territoriesshould when admitted as states come in with or without slavery at theirown option why did it not say so</s>  with such a universal provision allknow the bills could not have passed</s>  did they thencould theyestablisha principle contrary to their own intention</s>  still further if theyintended to establish the principle that whenever congress had controlit should be left to the people to do as they thought fit with slaverywhy did they not authorize the people of the district of columbia attheir option to abolish slavery within their limits</s> i personally know that this has not been left undone because it wasunthought of</s>  it was frequently spoken of by members of congress and bycitizens of washington six years ago and i heard no one express a doubtthat a system of gradual emancipation with compensation to ownerswould meet the approbation of a large majority of the white people of thedistrict</s>  but without the action of congress they could say nothing andcongress said no</s>  in the measures of 1850 congress had the subject ofslavery in the district expressly on hand</s>  if they were then establishingthe principle of allowing the people to do as they please with slaverywhy did they not apply the principle to that people</s> again it is claimed that by the resolutions of the illinois legislaturepassed in 1851 the repeal of the missouri compromise was demanded</s>  thisi deny also</s>  whatever may be worked out by a criticism of the language ofthose resolutions the people have never understood them as being anymore than an indorsement of the compromises of 1850 and a release of oursenators from voting for the wilmot proviso</s>  the whole people are livingwitnesses that this only was their view</s>  finally it is asked if wedid not mean to apply the utah and new mexico provision to all futureterritories what did we mean when we in 1852 indorsed the compromisesof 1850</s> for myself i can answer this question most easily</s>  i meant not to ask arepeal or modification of the fugitive slave law</s>  i meant not to askfor the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia</s>  i meant not toresist the admission of utah and new mexico even should they ask to comein as slave states</s>  i meant nothing about additional territories becauseas i understood we then had no territory whose character as to slaverywas not already settled</s>  as to nebraska i regarded its character as beingfixed by the missouri compromise for thirty yearsas unalterably fixedas that of my own home in illinois</s>  as to new acquisitions i saidsufficient unto the day is the evil thereof</s>  when we make newacquisitions we will as heretofore try to manage them somehow</s>  that ismy answer that is what i meant and said and i appeal to the people tosay each for himself whether that is not also the universal meaning of thefree states</s> and now in turn let me ask a few questions</s>  if by any or all thesematters the repeal of the missouri compromise was commanded why was notthe command sooner obeyed</s>  why was the repeal omitted in the nebraskabill of 1853</s>  why was it omitted in the original bill of 1854</s>  why in theaccompanying report was such a repeal characterized as a departure fromthe course pursued in 1850 and its continued omission recommended</s> i am aware judge douglas now argues that the subsequent express repeal isno substantial alteration of the bill</s>  this argument seems wonderful tome</s>  it is as if one should argue that white and black are not different</s> he admits however that there is a literal change in the bill and thathe made the change in deference to other senators who would not supportthe bill without</s>  this proves that those other senators thought thechange a substantial one and that the judge thought their opinions worthdeferring to</s>  his own opinions therefore seem not to rest on a very firmbasis even in his own mind and i suppose the world believes and willcontinue to believe that precisely on the substance of that change thiswhole agitation has arisen</s> i conclude then that the public never demanded the repeal of themissouri compromise</s> i now come to consider whether the appeal with its avowed principles isintrinsically right</s>  i insist that it is not</s>  take the particular case</s>  acontroversy had arisen between the advocates and opponents of slaveryin relation to its establishment within the country we had purchased offrance</s>  the southern and then best part of the purchase was already inas a slave state</s>  the controversy was settled by also letting missouriin as a slave state but with the agreement that within all the remainingpart of the purchase north of a certain line there should never beslavery</s>  as to what was to be done with the remaining part south of theline nothing was said but perhaps the fair implication was it shouldcome in with slavery if it should so choose</s>  the southern part except aportion heretofore mentioned afterward did come in with slavery as thestate of arkansas</s>  all these many years since 1820 the northern parthad remained a wilderness</s>  at length settlements began in it also</s>  in duecourse iowa came in as a free state and minnesota was given a territorialgovernment without removing the slavery restriction</s>  finally thesole remaining part north of the linekansas and nebraskawas to beorganized and it is proposed and carried to blot out the old dividingline of thirtyfour years standing and to open the whole of that countryto the introduction of slavery</s>  now this to my mind is manifestlyunjust</s>  after an angry and dangerous controversy the parties made friendsby dividing the bone of contention</s>  the one party first appropriates herown share beyond all power to be disturbed in the possession of it andthen seizes the share of the other party</s>  it is as if two starving men haddivided their only loaf the one had hastily swallowed his half and thengrabbed the others half just as he was putting it to his mouth</s> let me here drop the main argument to notice what i consider ratheran inferior matter</s>  it is argued that slavery will not go to kansas andnebraska in any event</s>  this is a palliation a lullaby</s>  i have some hopethat it will not but let us not be too confident</s>  as to climate a glanceat the map shows that there are five slave statesdelaware marylandvirginia kentucky and missouri and also the district of columbia allnorth of the missouri compromise line</s>  the census returns of 1850 showthat within these there are eight hundred and sixtyseven thousand twohundred and seventysix slaves being more than one fourth of all theslaves in the nation</s> it is not climate then that will keep slavery out of these territories</s> is there anything in the peculiar nature of the country</s>  missouri adjoinsthese territories by her entire western boundary and slavery is alreadywithin every one of her western counties</s>  i have even heard it said thatthere are more slaves in proportion to whites in the northwestern countyof missouri than within any other county in the state</s>  slavery pressedentirely up to the old western boundary of the state and when ratherrecently a part of that boundary at the northwest was moved out a littlefarther west slavery followed on quite up to the new line</s>  now when therestriction is removed what is to prevent it from going still farther</s> climate will not no peculiarity of the country will nothing in naturewill</s>  will the disposition of the people prevent it</s>  those nearest thescene are all in favor of the extension</s>  the yankees who are opposed to itmay be most flumerous but in military phrase the battlefield is too farfrom their base of operations</s> but it is said there now is no law in nebraska on the subject of slaveryand that in such case taking a slave there operates his freedom</s>  that isgood booklaw but it is not the rule of actual practice</s>  wherever slaveryis it has been first introduced without law</s>  the oldest laws we findconcerning it are not laws introducing it but regulating it as an alreadyexisting thing</s>  a white man takes his slave to nebraska now</s>  who willinform the negro that he is free</s>  who will take him before court to testthe question of his freedom</s>  in ignorance of his legal emancipation he iskept chopping splitting and plowing</s>  others are brought and move on inthe same track</s>  at last if ever the time for voting comes on the questionof slavery the institution already in fact exists in the country andcannot well be removed</s>  the fact of its presence and the difficulty ofits removal will carry the vote in its favor</s>  keep it out until a vote istaken and a vote in favor of it cannot be got in any population of fortythousand on earth who have been drawn together by the ordinary motives ofemigration and settlement</s>  to get slaves into the territory simultaneouslywith the whites in the incipient stages of settlement is the precise stakeplayed for and won in this nebraska measure</s> the question is asked us if slaves will go in notwithstanding thegeneral principle of law liberates them why would they not equally go inagainst positive statute lawgo in even if the missouri restriction weremaintained</s>  i answer because it takes a much bolder man to venturein with his property in the latter case than in the former because thepositive congressional enactment is known to and respected by all ornearly all whereas the negative principle that no law is free law is notmuch known except among lawyers</s>  we have some experience of this practicaldifference</s>  in spite of the ordinance of 87 a few negroes were broughtinto illinois and held in a state of quasislavery not enough howeverto carry a vote of the people in favor of the institution when they cameto form a constitution</s>  but into the adjoining missouri country wherethere was no ordinance of 87was no restrictionthey were carriedten times nay a hundred times as fast and actually made a slave state</s> this is factnaked fact</s> another lullaby argument is that taking slaves to new countries does notincrease their number does not make any one slave who would otherwisebe free</s>  there is some truth in this and i am glad of it but it is notwholly true</s>  the african slave trade is not yet effectually suppressedand if we make a reasonable deduction for the white people among us whoare foreigners and the descendants of foreigners arriving here since 1808we shall find the increase of the black population outrunning that of thewhite to an extent unaccountable except by supposing that some of themtoo have been coming from africa</s>  if this be so the opening of newcountries to the institution increases the demand for and augments theprice of slaves and so does in fact make slaves of freemen by causingthem to be brought from africa and sold into bondage</s> but however this may be we know the opening of new countries to slaverytends to the perpetuation of the institution and so does keep men inslavery who would otherwise be free</s>  this result we do not feel likefavoring and we are under no legal obligation to suppress our feelings inthis respect</s> equal justice to the south it is said requires us to consent to theextension of slavery to new countries</s>  that is to say inasmuch as you donot object to my taking my hog to nebraska therefore i must not objectto your taking your slave</s>  now i admit that this is perfectly logicalif there is no difference between hogs and negroes</s>  but while you thusrequire me to deny the humanity of the negro i wish to ask whether you ofthe south yourselves have ever been willing to do as much</s>  it is kindlyprovided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentageare natural tyrants</s>  that percentage is no larger in the slave statesthan in the free</s>  the great majority south as well as north have humansympathies of which they can no more divest themselves than they can oftheir sensibility to physical pain</s>  these sympathies in the bosoms ofthe southern people manifest in many ways their sense of the wrong ofslavery and their consciousness that after all there is humanity in thenegro</s>  if they deny this let me address them a few plain questions</s>  in1820 you the south joined the north almost unanimously in declaringthe african slave trade piracy and in annexing to it the punishment ofdeath</s>  why did you do this</s>  if you did not feel that it was wrong why didyou join in providing that men should be hung for it</s>  the practice was nomore than bringing wild negroes from africa to such as would buy them</s> but you never thought of hanging men for catching and selling wild horseswild buffaloes or wild bears</s> again you have among you a sneaking individual of the class of nativetyrants known as the slavedealer</s>  he watches your necessities andcrawls up to buy your slave at a speculating price</s>  if you cannot helpit you sell to him but if you can help it you drive him from your door</s> you despise him utterly</s>  you do not recognize him as a friend or evenas an honest man</s>  your children must not play with his they may rollickfreely with the little negroes but not with the slavedealers children</s> if you are obliged to deal with him you try to get through the jobwithout so much as touching him</s>  it is common with you to join handswith the men you meet but with the slavedealer you avoid theceremonyinstinctively shrinking from the snaky contact</s>  if he grows richand retires from business you still remember him and still keep up theban of nonintercourse upon him and his family</s>  now why is this</s>  you donot so treat the man who deals in corn cotton or tobacco</s> and yet again there are in the united states and territories includingthe district of columbia 433643 free blacks</s>  at five hundred dollars perhead they are worth over two hundred millions of dollars</s>  how comes thisvast amount of property to be running about without owners</s>  we do not seefree horses or free cattle running at large</s>  how is this</s>  all these freeblacks are the descendants of slaves or have been slaves themselves andthey would be slaves now but for something which has operated on theirwhite owners inducing them at vast pecuniary sacrifice to liberate them</s> what is that something</s>  is there any mistaking it</s>  in all these cases itis your sense of justice and human sympathy continually telling you thatthe poor negro has some natural right to himselfthat those who deny itand make mere merchandise of him deserve kickings contempt and death</s> and now why will you ask us to deny the humanity of the slave andestimate him as only the equal of the hog</s>  why ask us to do what you willnot do yourselves</s>  why ask us to do for nothing what two hundred millionsof dollars could not induce you to do</s> but one great argument in support of the repeal of the missouri compromiseis still to come</s>  that argument is the sacred right of selfgovernment</s> it seems our distinguished senator has found great difficulty in gettinghis antagonists even in the senate to meet him fairly on this argument</s> some poet has saidfools rush in where angels fear to tread</s> at the hazard of being thought one of the fools of this quotation imeet that argumenti rush ini take that bull by the horns</s>  i trust iunderstand and truly estimate the right of selfgovernment</s>  my faith inthe proposition that each man should do precisely as he pleases withall which is exclusively his own lies at the foundation of the sense ofjustice there is in me</s>  i extend the principle to communities of men aswell as to individuals</s>  i so extend it because it is politically wise aswell as naturally just politically wise in saving us from broils aboutmatters which do not concern us</s>  here or at washington i would nottrouble myself with the oyster laws of virginia or the cranberry lawsof indiana</s>  the doctrine of selfgovernment is rightabsolutely andeternally rightbut it has no just application as here attempted</s>  orperhaps i should rather say that whether it has such application dependsupon whether a negro is or is not a man</s>  if he is not a man in that casehe who is a man may as a matter of selfgovernment do just what he pleaseswith him</s>  but if the negro is a man is it not to that extent a totaldestruction of selfgovernment to say that he too shall not governhimself</s>  when the white man governs himself that is selfgovernment butwhen he governs himself and also governs another man that is more thanselfgovernmentthat is despotism</s>  if the negro is a man why then myancient faith teaches me that all men are created equal and that therecan be no moral right in connection with one mans making a slave ofanother</s> judge douglas frequently with bitter irony and sarcasm paraphrasesour argument by saying the white people of nebraska are good enough togovern themselves but they are not good enough to govern a few miserablenegroes</s> well i doubt not that the people of nebraska are and will continue tobe as good as the average of people elsewhere</s>  i do not say the contrary</s> what i do say is that no man is good enough to govern another manwithout that others consent</s>  i say this is the leading principle thesheetanchor of american republicanism</s>  our declaration of independencesayswe hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are created equalthat they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rightsthat among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness</s>  that tosecure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving theirjust powers prom the consent of the governed</s> i have quoted so much at this time merely to show that according to ourancient faith the just powers of government are derived from the consentof the governed</s>  now the relation of master and slave is pro tanto a totalviolation of this principle</s>  the master not only governs the slave withouthis consent but he governs him by a set of rules altogether differentfrom those which he prescribes for himself</s>  allow all the governedan equal voice in the government and that and that only isselfgovernment</s> let it not be said that i am contending for the establishment of politicaland social equality between the whites and blacks</s>  i have already said thecontrary</s>  i am not combating the argument of necessity arising from thefact that the blacks are already among us but i am combating what is setup as moral argument for allowing them to be taken where they have neveryet beenarguing against the extension of a bad thing which where italready exists we must of necessity manage as we best can</s> in support of his application of the doctrine of selfgovernment senatordouglas has sought to bring to his aid the opinions and examples of ourrevolutionary fathers</s>  i am glad he has done this</s>  i love the sentimentsof those oldtime men and shall be most happy to abide by their opinions</s> he shows us that when it was in contemplation for the colonies to breakoff from great britain and set up a new government for themselvesseveral of the states instructed their delegates to go for the measureprovided each state should be allowed to regulate its domestic concerns inits own way</s>  i do not quote but this in substance</s>  this was right i seenothing objectionable in it</s>  i also think it probable that it had somereference to the existence of slavery among them</s>  i will not deny thatit had</s>  but had it any reference to the carrying of slavery into newcountries</s>  that is the question and we will let the fathers themselvesanswer it</s> this same generation of men and mostly the same individuals of thegeneration who declared this principle who declared independencewho fought the war of the revolution through who afterward made theconstitution under which we still livethese same men passed theordinance of 87 declaring that slavery should never go to the northwestterritory</s> i have no doubt judge douglas thinks they were very inconsistent in this</s> it is a question of discrimination between them and him</s>  but there isnot an inch of ground left for his claiming that their opinions theirexample their authority are on his side in the controversy</s> again is not nebraska while a territory a part of us</s>  do we not own thecountry</s>  and if we surrender the control of it do we not surrender theright of selfgovernment</s>  it is part of ourselves</s>  if you say we shall notcontrol it because it is only part the same is true of every other partand when all the parts are gone what has become of the whole</s>  whatis then left of us</s>  what use for the general government when there isnothing left for it to govern</s> but you say this question should be left to the people of nebraskabecause they are more particularly interested</s>  if this be the rule youmust leave it to each individual to say for himself whether he will haveslaves</s>  what better moral right have thirtyone citizens of nebraska tosay that the thirtysecond shall not hold slaves than the people ofthe thirtyone states have to say that slavery shall not go into thethirtysecond state at all</s> but if it is a sacred right for the people of nebraska to take and holdslaves there it is equally their sacred right to buy them where they canbuy them cheapest and that undoubtedly will be on the coast of africaprovided you will consent not to hang them for going there to buythem</s>  you must remove this restriction too from the sacred right ofselfgovernment</s>  i am aware you say that taking slaves from the states tonebraska does not make slaves of freemen but the african slavetrader cansay just as much</s>  he does not catch free negroes and bring them here</s> he finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors and hehonestly buys them at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head</s> this is very cheap and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right ofselfgovernment to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade</s> another important objection to this application of the right ofselfgovernment is that it enables the first few to deprive the succeedingmany of a free exercise of the right of selfgovernment</s>  the first fewmay get slavery in and the subsequent many cannot easily get it out</s>  howcommon is the remark now in the slave states if we were only clearof our slaves how much better it would be for us</s>  they are actuallydeprived of the privilege of governing themselves as they would by theaction of a very few in the beginning</s>  the same thing was true of thewhole nation at the time our constitution was formed</s> whether slavery shall go into nebraska or other new territories is nota matter of exclusive concern to the people who may go there</s>  the wholenation is interested that the best use shall be made of these territories</s> we want them for homes of free white people</s>  this they cannot be to anyconsiderable extent if slavery shall be planted within them</s>  slave statesare places for poor white people to remove from not to remove to</s>  newfree states are the places for poor people to go to and better theircondition</s>  for this use the nation needs these territories</s> still further there are constitutional relations between the slaveand free states which are degrading to the latter</s>  we are under legalobligations to catch and return their runaway slaves to them a sortof dirty disagreeable job which i believe as a general rule theslaveholders will not perform for one another</s>  then again in the controlof the governmentthe management of the partnership affairsthey havegreatly the advantage of us</s>  by the constitution each state has twosenators each has a number of representatives in proportion to the numberof its people and each has a number of presidential electors equal tothe whole number of its senators and representatives together</s>  but inascertaining the number of the people for this purpose five slaves arecounted as being equal to three whites</s>  the slaves do not vote they areonly counted and so used as to swell the influence of the white peoplesvotes</s>  the practical effect of this is more aptly shown by a comparisonof the states of south carolina and maine</s>  south carolina has sixrepresentatives and so has maine south carolina has eight presidentialelectors and so has maine</s>  this is precise equality so far and of coursethey are equal in senators each having two</s>  thus in the control of thegovernment the two states are equals precisely</s>  but how are they in thenumber of their white people</s>  maine has 581813 while south carolina has274567 maine has twice as many as south carolina and 32679 over</s>  thuseach white man in south carolina is more than the double of any man inmaine</s>  this is all because south carolina besides her free people has384984 slaves</s>  the south carolinian has precisely the same advantage overthe white man in every other free state as well as in maine</s>  he is morethan the double of any one of us in this crowd</s>  the same advantage butnot to the same extent is held by all the citizens of the slave statesover those of the free and it is an absolute truth without an exceptionthat there is no voter in any slave state but who has more legal power inthe government than any voter in any free state</s>  there is no instanceof exact equality and the disadvantage is against us the whole chapterthrough</s>  this principle in the aggregate gives the slave states in thepresent congress twenty additional representatives being seven more thanthe whole majority by which they passed the nebraska bill</s> now all this is manifestly unfair yet i do not mention it to complain ofit in so far as it is already settled</s>  it is in the constitution and ido not for that cause or any other cause propose to destroy or alteror disregard the constitution</s>  i stand to it fairly fully and firmly</s> but when i am told i must leave it altogether to other people to saywhether new partners are to be bred up and brought into the firm onthe same degrading terms against me i respectfully demur</s>  i insist thatwhether i shall be a whole man or only the half of one in comparison withothers is a question in which i am somewhat concerned and one which noother man can have a sacred right of deciding for me</s>  if i am wrong inthis if it really be a sacred right of selfgovernment in the man whoshall go to nebraska to decide whether he will be the equal of me or thedouble of me then after he shall have exercised that right and therebyshall have reduced me to a still smaller fraction of a man than i alreadyam i should like for some gentleman deeply skilled in the mysteries ofsacred rights to provide himself with a microscope and peep about andfind out if he can what has become of my sacred rights</s>  they will surelybe too small for detection with the naked eye</s> finally i insist that if there is anything which it is the duty of thewhole people to never intrust to any hands but their own that thing isthe preservation and perpetuity of their own liberties and institutions</s> and if they shall think as i do that the extension of slavery endangersthem more than any or all other causes how recreant to themselves ifthey submit the question and with it the fate of their country to a merehandful of men bent only on seifinterest</s>  if this question of slaveryextension were an insignificant one one having no power to do harmitmight be shuffled aside in this way and being as it is the greatbehemoth of danger shall the strong grip of the nation be loosened uponhim to intrust him to the hands of such feeble keepers</s> i have done with this mighty argument of selfgovernment</s>  go sacredthing</s>  go in peace</s> but nebraska is urged as a great unionsaving measure</s>  well i too go forsaving the union</s>  much as i hate slavery i would consent to the extensionof it rather than see the union dissolved just as i would consent to anygreat evil to avoid a greater one</s>  but when i go to unionsaving i mustbelieve at least that the means i employ have some adaptation to theend</s>  to my mind nebraska has no such adaptation</s> it hath no relish of salvation in it</s> it is an aggravation rather of the only one thing which ever endangersthe union</s>  when it came upon us all was peace and quiet</s>  the nation waslooking to the forming of new bends of union and a long course of peaceand prosperity seemed to lie before us</s>  in the whole range of possibilitythere scarcely appears to me to have been anything out of which theslavery agitation could have been revived except the very project ofrepealing the missouri compromise</s>  every inch of territory we ownedalready had a definite settlement of the slavery question by which allparties were pledged to abide</s>  indeed there was no uninhabited country onthe continent which we could acquire if we except some extreme northernregions which are wholly out of the question</s> in this state of affairs the genius of discord himself could scarcely haveinvented a way of again setting us by the ears but by turning back anddestroying the peace measures of the past</s>  the counsels of that geniusseem to have prevailed</s>  the missouri compromise was repealed and herewe are in the midst of a new slavery

reason to know and in fact knowing it must and would beso resisted</s>  it could not but be expected by its author that it would belooked upon as a measure for the extension of slavery aggravated by agross breach of faith</s> argue as you will and long as you will this is the naked front and aspectof the measure</s>  and in this aspect it could not but produce agitation</s> slavery is founded in

bill is very peculiar</s>  the people areto decide the question of slavery for themselves but when they are todecide or how they are to decide or whether when the question isonce decided it is to remain so or is to be subject to an indefinitesuccession of new trials the law does not say</s>  is it to be decided by thefirst dozen settlers who arrive there or is it to await the arrival ofa hundred</s>  is it to be decided by a vote of the people or a vote of thelegislature or indeed by a vote of any sort</s>  to these questions the lawgives no answer</s>  there is a mystery about this for when a member proposedto give the legislature express authority to exclude slavery it washooted down by the friends of the bill</s>  this fact is worth remembering</s> some yankees in the east are sending emigrants to nebraska to excludeslavery from it and so far as i can judge they expect the question tobe decided by voting in some way or other</s>  but the missourians are awaketoo</s>  they are within a stonesthrow of the contested ground</s>  they holdmeetings and pass resolutions in which not the slightest allusion tovoting is made</s>  they resolve that slavery already exists in the

the constitution just as anafflicted man hides away a wen or cancer which he dares not cut out atonce lest he bleed to deathwith the promise nevertheless that thecutting may begin at a certain time</s>  less than this our fathers could notdo and more they would not do</s>  necessity drove them so far and fartherthey would not go</s>  but this is not all</s>  the earliest congress under theconstitution took the same view of slavery</s>  they hedged and hemmed it into the narrowest limits of necessity</s> in 1794 they prohibited an outgoing slave tradethat is the takingof slaves from the united states to sell</s>  in 1798 they prohibited thebringing of slaves from africa into the mississippi territory thisterritory then comprising what are now the states of mississippi andalabama</s>  this was ten years before they had the authority to do the samething as to the states existing at the adoption of the constitution</s>  in1800 they prohibited american citizens from trading in slaves betweenforeign countries as for instance from africa to brazil</s>  in 1803 theypassed a law in aid of one or two slavestate laws in restraint of theinternal slave trade</s>  in 1807 in apparent hot haste they passed the lawnearly a year in advanceto take effect the first day of 1808 the veryfirst day the constitution would permit prohibiting the african slavetrade by heavy pecuniary and corporal penalties</s>  in 1820 finding theseprovisions ineffectual they declared the slave trade piracy and annexedto it the extreme penalty of death</s>  while all this was passing in thegeneral government five or six of the original slave states had adoptedsystems of gradual emancipation by which the institution was rapidlybecoming extinct within their limits</s>  thus we see that the plainunmistakable spirit of that age toward slavery was hostility to theprinciple and toleration only by necessity</s> but now it is to be transformed into a sacred right</s>  nebraska brings

the ship ofstate</s>  little by little but steadily as mans march to the grave we havebeen giving up the old for the new faith</s>  near eighty years ago we beganby declaring that all men are created equal but now from that beginningwe have run down to the other declaration that for some men to enslaveothers is a sacred right of selfgovernment</s>  these principles cannotstand together</s>  they are as opposite as god and mammon and who ever holdsto the one must despise the other</s>  when pettit in connection with hissupport of the nebraska bill called the declaration of independence aselfevident lie he only did what consistency and candor require allother nebraska men to do</s>  of the fortyodd nebraska senators who satpresent and heard him no one rebuked him</s>  nor am i

we shall not only have saved the union but we shallhave so saved it as to make and to keep it forever worthy of the saving</s> we shall have so saved it that the succeeding millions of free happypeople the world over shall rise up and call us blessed to the latestgenerations</s> at springfield twelve days ago where i had spoken substantially as ihave here judge douglas replied to me and as he is to reply to me herei shall attempt to anticipate him by noticing some of the points he madethere</s>  he commenced by stating i had assumed all the way through that theprinciple of the nebraska bill would have the effect of extending slavery</s> he denied that this was intended or that this effect would follow</s> i will not reopen the argument upon this point</s>  that such was theintention the world believed at the start and will continue to believe</s> this was the countenance of the thing and both friends and enemiesinstantly recognized it as such</s>  that countenance cannot now be changed byargument</s>  you can as easily argue the color out of the negros skin</s>  likethe bloody hand you may wash it and wash it the red witness of guiltstill sticks and stares horribly at you</s> next he says that congressional intervention never prevented slaveryanywhere that it did not prevent it in the northwestern territory norin illinois that in fact illinois came into the union as a slave statethat the principle of the nebraska bill expelled it from illinois fromseveral old states from everywhere</s> now this is mere quibbling all the way through</s>  if the ordinance of 87did not keep slavery out of the northwest territory how happens it thatthe northwest shore of the ohio river is entirely free from it while thesoutheast shore less than a mile distant along nearly the whole lengthof the river is entirely covered with it</s> if that ordinance did not keep it out of illinois what was it that madethe difference between illinois and missouri</s>  they lie side by side themississippi river only dividing them while their early settlements werewithin the same latitude</s>
 between 1810 and 1820 the number of slaves inmissouri increased 7211 while in illinois in the same ten years theydecreased 51</s>  this appears by the census returns</s>  during nearly all ofthat ten years both were territories not states</s>  during this time theordinance forbade slavery to go into illinois and nothing forbade it togo into missouri</s>  it did go into missouri and did not go into illinois</s> that is the fact</s>  can any one doubt as to the reason of it</s>  but he saysillinois came into the union as a slave state</s>  silence perhaps wouldbe the best answer to this flat contradiction of the known history of thecountry</s>  what are the facts upon which this bold assertion is based</s>  whenwe first acquired the country as far back as 1787 there were some slaveswithin it held by the french inhabitants of kaskaskia</s>  the territoriallegislation admitted a few negroes from the slave states as indenturedservants</s>  one year after the adoption of the first state constitutionthe whole number of them waswhat do you think</s>  just one hundred andseventeen while the aggregate free population was 55094about fourhundred and seventy to one</s>  upon this state of facts the people framedtheir constitution prohibiting the further introduction of slavery witha sort of guaranty to the owners of the few indentured servants givingfreedom to their children to be born thereafter and making no mentionwhatever of any supposed slave for life</s>  out of this small matter thejudge manufactures his argument that illinois came into the union as aslave state</s>  let the facts be the answer to the argument</s> the principles of the nebraska bill he says expelled slavery fromillinois</s>  the principle of that bill first planted it herethat is itfirst came because there was no law to prevent it first came before weowned the country and finding it here and having the ordinance of 87 toprevent its increasing our people struggled along and finally got rid ofit as best they could</s> but the principle of the nebraska bill abolished slavery in several of theold states</s>  well it is true that several of the old states in the lastquarter of the last century did adopt systems of gradual emancipation bywhich the institution has finally become extinct within their limits butit may or may not be true that the principle of the nebraska bill wasthe cause that led to the adoption of these measures</s>  it is now morethan fifty years since the last of these states adopted its system ofemancipation</s> if the nebraska bill is the real author of the benevolent works itis rather deplorable that it has for so long a time ceased workingaltogether</s>  is there not some reason to suspect that it was the principleof the revolution and not the principle of the nebraska bill that ledto emancipation in these old states</s>
 leave it to the people of these oldemancipating states and i am quite certain they will decide that neitherthat nor any other good thing ever did or ever will come of the nebraskabill</s> in the course of my main argument judge douglas interrupted me to saythat the principle of the nebraska bill was very old that it originatedwhen god made man and placed good and evil before him allowing him tochoose for himself being responsible for the choice he should make</s>  atthe time i thought this was merely playful and i answered it accordingly</s> but in his reply to me he renewed it as a serious argument</s>  inseriousness then the facts of this proposition are not true as stated</s> god did not place good and evil before man telling him to make hischoice</s>  on the contrary he did tell him there was one tree of the fruitof which he should not eat upon pain of certain death</s>  i should scarcelywish so strong a prohibition against slavery in nebraska</s> but this argument strikes me as not a little remarkable in anotherparticularin its strong resemblance to the old argument for the divineright of kings</s>  by the latter the king is to do just as he pleases withhis white subjects being responsible to god alone</s>  by the formerthe white man is to do just as he pleases with his black slaves beingresponsible to god alone</s>  the two things are precisely alike and it isbut natural that they should find similar arguments to sustain them</s> i had argued that the application of the principle of selfgovernment ascontended for would require the revival of the african slave trade thatno argument could be made in favor of a mans right to take slaves tonebraska which could not be equally well made in favor of his rightto bring them from the coast of africa</s>  the judge replied that theconstitution requires the suppression of the foreign slave trade butdoes not require the prohibition of slavery in the territories</s>  that is amistake in point of fact</s>  the constitution does not require the action ofcongress in either case and it does authorize it in both</s>  and so there isstill no difference between the cases</s> in regard to what i have said of the advantage the slave states have overthe free in the matter of representation the judge replied that we inthe free states count five free negroes as five white people while inthe slave states they count five slaves as three whites only and that theadvantage at last was on the side of the free states</s> now in the slave states they count free negroes just as we do and it sohappens that besides their slaves they have as many free negroes as wehave and thirty thousand over</s>  thus their free negroes more than balanceours and their advantage over us in consequence of their slaves stillremains as i stated it</s> in reply to my argument that the compromise measures of 1850 were a systemof equivalents and that the provisions of no one of them could fairlybe carried to other subjects without its corresponding equivalent beingcarried with it the judge denied outright that these measures had anyconnection with or dependence upon each other</s>  this is mere desperation</s> if they had no connection why are they always spoken of in connection</s> why has he so spoken of them a thousand times</s>  why has he constantlycalled them a series of measures</s>  why does everybody call them acompromise</s>  why was california kept out of the union six or seven monthsif it was not because of its connection with the other measures</s>  webstersleading definition of the verb to compromise is to adjust and settlea difference by mutual agreement with concessions of claims by theparties</s>  this conveys precisely the popular understanding of the wordcompromise</s> we knew before the judge told us that these measures passed separatelyand in distinct bills and that no two of them were passed by the votes ofprecisely the same members</s>  but we also know and so does he know thatno one of them could have passed both branches of congress but for theunderstanding that the others were to pass also</s>  upon this understandingeach got votes which it could have got in no other way</s>  it is this factwhich gives to the measures their true character and it is the universalknowledge of this fact that has given them the name of compromises soexpressive of that true character</s> i had asked if in carrying the utah and new mexico laws to nebraskayou could clear away other objection how could you leave nebraskaperfectly free to introduce slavery before she forms a constitutionduring her territorial government while the utah and new mexico lawsonly authorize it when they form constitutions and are admitted into theunion</s>  to this judge douglas answered that the utah and new mexico lawsalso authorized it before and to prove this he read from one of theirlaws as follows that the legislative power of said territory shallextend to all rightful subjects of legislation consistent with theconstitution of the united states and the provisions of this act</s> now it is perceived from the reading of this that there is nothing expressupon the subject but that the authority is sought to be implied merelyfor the general provision of all rightful subjects of legislation</s>  inreply to this i insist as a legal rule of construction as well as theplain popular view of the matter that the express provision for utah andnew mexico coming in with slavery if they choose when they shall formconstitutions is an exclusion of all implied authority on the samesubject that congress having the subject distinctly in their mindswhen they made the express provision they therein expressed their wholemeaning on that subject</s> the judge rather insinuated that i had found it convenient to forget thewashington territorial law passed in 1853</s>  this was a division of oregonorganizing the northern part as the territory of washington</s>  he assertedthat by this act the ordinance of 87 theretofore existing in oregon wasrepealed that nearly all the members of congress voted for it beginningin the house of representatives with charles allen of massachusetts andending with richard yates of illinois and that he could not understandhow those who now opposed the nebraska bill so voted there unless it wasbecause it was then too soon after both the great political parties hadratified the compromises of 1850 and the ratification therefore was toofresh to be then repudiated</s> now i had seen the washington act before and i have carefully examined itsince and i aver that there is no repeal of the ordinance of 87 or ofany prohibition of slavery in it</s>  in express terms there is absolutelynothing in the whole law upon the subjectin fact nothing to lead areader to think of the subject</s>  to my judgment it is equally free fromeverything from which repeal can be legally implied but however thismay be are men now to be entrapped by a legal implication extracted fromcovert language introduced perhaps for the very purpose of entrappingthem</s>  i sincerely wish every man could read this law quite throughcarefully watching every sentence and every line for a repeal of theordinance of 87 or anything equivalent to it</s> another point on the washington act if it was intended to be modeledafter the utah and new mexico acts as judge douglas insists why was itnot inserted in it as in them that washington was to come in with orwithout slavery as she may choose at the adoption of her constitution</s> it has no such provision in it and i defy the ingenuity of man to give areason for the omission other than that it was not intended to follow theutah and new mexico laws in regard to the question of slavery</s> the washington act not only differs vitally from the utah and new mexicoacts but the nebraska act differs vitally from both</s>  by the latteract the people are left perfectly free to regulate their own domesticconcerns etc</s>  but in all the former all their laws are to be submittedto congress and if disapproved are to be null</s>  the washington act goeseven further it absolutely prohibits the territorial legislature by verystrong and guarded language from establishing banks or borrowing money onthe faith of the territory</s>  is this the sacred right of selfgovernmentwe hear vaunted so much</s>  no sir the nebraska bill finds no model in theacts of 50 or the washington act</s>  it finds no model in any law from adamtill today</s>  as phillips says of napoleon the nebraska act is grandgloomy and peculiar wrapped in the solitude of its own originalitywithout a model and without a shadow upon the earth</s> in the course of his reply senator douglas remarked in substance that hehad always considered this government was made for the white people andnot for the negroes</s>  why in point of mere fact i think so too</s>  but inthis remark of the judge there is a significance which i think is the keyto the great mistake if there is any such mistake which he has madein this nebraska measure</s>  it shows that the judge has no very vividimpression that the negro is human and consequently has no idea thatthere can be any moral question in legislating about him</s>  in his view thequestion of whether a new country shall be slave or free is a matter of asutter indifference as it is whether his neighbor shall plant his farm withtobacco or stock it with horned cattle</s>  now whether this view is rightor wrong it is very certain that the great mass of mankind take a totallydifferent view</s>  they consider slavery a great moral wrong and theirfeeling against it is not evanescent but eternal</s>  it lies at the veryfoundation of their sense of justice and it cannot be trifled with</s>  itis a great and durable element of popular action and i think no statesmancan safely disregard it</s> our senator also objects that those who oppose him in this matter do notentirely agree with one another</s>  he reminds me that in my firm adherenceto the constitutional rights of the slave states i differ widely fromothers who are cooperating with me in opposing the nebraska bill and hesays it is not quite fair to oppose him in this variety of ways</s>  he shouldremember that he took us by surpriseastounded us by this measure</s>  wewere thunderstruck and stunned and we reeled and fell in utter confusion</s> but we rose each fighting grasping whatever he could first reachascythe a pitchfork a choppingax or a butchers cleaver</s>  we struck inthe direction of the sound and we were rapidly closing in upon him</s>  hemust not think to divert us from our purpose by showing us that our drillour dress and our weapons are not entirely perfect and uniform</s>  when thestorm shall be past he shall find us still americans no less devoted tothe continued union and prosperity of the country than heretofore</s> finally the judge invokes against me the memory of clay and webster theywere great men and men of great deeds</s>  but where have i assailed them</s> for what is it that their lifelong enemy shall now make profit by assumingto defend them against me their lifelong friend</s>  i go against the repealof the missouri compromise did they ever go for it</s>  they went for thecompromise of 1850 did i ever go against them</s>  they were greatly devotedto the union to the small measure of my ability was i ever less so</s>  clayand webster were dead before this question arose by what authority shallour senator say they would espouse his side of it if alive</s>  mr</s>  clay wasthe leading spirit in making the missouri compromise is it very crediblethat if now alive he would take the lead in the breaking of it</s>  the truthis that some support from whigs is now a necessity with the judge and forthis it is that the names of clay and webster are invoked</s>  his old friendshave deserted him in such numbers as to leave too few to live by</s>  hecame to his own and his own received him not and lo</s>  he turns unto thegentiles</s> a word now as to the judges desperate assumption that the compromises of1850 had no connection with one another that illinois came into the unionas a slave state and some other similar ones</s>  this is no other than abold denial of the history of the country</s>  if we do not know that thecompromises of 1850 were dependent on each other if we do not know thatillinois came into the union as a free statewe do not know anything</s> if we do not know these things we do not know that we ever had arevolutionary war or such a chief as washington</s>  to deny these things isto deny our national axiomsor dogmas at leastand it puts an end toall argument</s>  if a man will stand up and assert and repeat and reassertthat two and two do not make four i know nothing in the power of argumentthat can stop him</s>  i think i can answer the judge so long as he sticks tothe premises but when he flies from them i cannot work any argument intothe consistency of a mental gag and actually close his mouth with it</s>  insuch a case i can only commend him to the seventy thousand answers just infrom

and they beg you to helpsave their property and you vote against your interests and principle toaccommodate a neighbor hoping that your vote will be on the losing side</s> and others do the same and in those ways slavery gets a sure foothold</s> and when that is done the whole mighty unionthe force of the nationiscommitted to its support</s>  and that very process is working in kansastoday</s>

truth at the bottom</s>  i do not mean that it istrue in essence as he would have us believe</s>  it could not be essentiallytrue if the ordinance of 87 was valid</s>  but in point of fact therewere some degraded beings called slaves in kaskaskia and the other frenchsettlements when our first state constitution was adopted that is a factand i dont deny it</s>  slaves were brought here as early as 1720 and werekept here in spite of the ordinance of 1787 against it</s>  but slavery didnot thrive here</s>  on the contrary under the influence of the ordinance thenumber decreased fiftyone from 1810 to 1820 while under the influence ofsquatter sovereignty right across the river in missouri they increasedseven thousand two hundred and eleven in the same time and slaveryfinally faded out in illinois under the influence of the law of freedomwhile it grew stronger and stronger in missouri under the law or practiceof popular sovereignty</s>  in point of fact there were but one hundred andseventeen slaves in illinois one year after its admission or one to everyfour hundred and seventy of its population or to state it in anotherway if illinois was a slave state in 1820 so were new york and newjersey much greater slave states from having had greater numbers slaveryhaving been established there in very early times</s>  but there is this vitaldifference between all these states and the judges kansas experimentthat they sought to disestablish slavery which had been alreadyestablished while the judge seeks so far as he can to disestablishfreedom which had been established

fellowcitizensi am here tonight partly by the invitation of some ofyou and partly by my own inclination</s>  two weeks ago judge douglas spokehere on the several subjects of kansas the dred scott decision and utah</s> i listened to the speech at the time and have the report of it since</s> it was intended to controvert opinions which i think just and to assailpolitically not personally those men who in common with me entertainthose opinions</s>  for this reason i wished then and still wish to makesome answer to it which i now take the opportunity of doing</s> i begin with utah</s>  if it prove to be true as is probable that the peopleof utah are in open rebellion to the united states then judge douglas isin favor of repealing their territorial organization and attaching themto the adjoining states for judicial purposes</s>  i say too if they are inrebellion they ought to be somehow coerced to obedience and i am not nowprepared to admit or deny that the judges mode of coercing them is notas good as any</s>  the republicans can fall in with it without taking backanything they have ever said</s>  to be sure it would be a considerablebacking down by judge douglas from his muchvaunted doctrine ofselfgovernment for the territories but this is only additional proofof what was very plain from the beginning that that doctrine was a meredeceitful pretense for the benefit of slavery</s>  those who could notsee that much in the nebraska act itself which forced governors andsecretaries and judges on the people of the territories without theirchoice or consent could not be made to see though one should rise fromthe dead</s> but in all this it is very plain the judge evades the only question therepublicans have ever pressed upon the democracy in regard to utah</s>  thatquestion the judge well knew to be this if the people of utah peacefullyform a state constitution tolerating polygamy will the democracy admitthem into the union</s>  there is nothing in the united states constitutionor law against polygamy and why is it not a part of the judges sacredright of selfgovernment for the people to have it or rather to keepit if they choose</s>  these questions so far as i know the judge neveranswers</s>  it might involve the democracy to answer them either way andthey go unanswered</s> as to kansas</s>  the substance of the judges speech on kansas is an effortto put the freestate men in the wrong for not voting at the election ofdelegates to the constitutional convention</s>  he saysthere is every reason to hope and believe that the law will be fairlyinterpreted and impartially executed so as to insure to every bona fideinhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise</s> it appears extraordinary that judge douglas should make such a statement</s> he knows that by the law no one can vote who has not been registeredand he knows that the freestate men place their refusal to vote on theground that but few of them have been registered</s>  it is possible that thisis not true but judge douglas knows it is asserted to be true in lettersnewspapers and public speeches and borne by every mail and blown byevery breeze to the eyes and ears of the world</s>  he knows it is boldlydeclared that the people of many whole counties and many wholeneighborhoods in others are left unregistered yet he does not ventureto contradict the declaration or to point out how they can vote withoutbeing registered but he just slips along not seeming to know there isany such question of fact and complacently declares there is every reason to hope and believe that the law will befairly and impartially executed so as to insure to every bona fideinhabitant the free and quiet exercise of the elective franchise</s> i readily agree that if all had a chance to vote they ought to have voted</s> if on the contrary as they allege and judge douglas ventures not toparticularly contradict few only of the freestate men had a chance tovote they were perfectly right in staying from the polls in a body</s> by the way since the judge spoke the kansas election has come off</s>  thejudge expressed his confidence that all the democrats in kansas woulddo their dutyincluding freestate democrats of course</s>  the returnsreceived here as yet are very incomplete but so far as they go theyindicate that only about one sixth of the registered voters have reallyvoted and this too when not more perhaps than one half of therightful voters have been registered thus showing the thing to havebeen altogether the most exquisite farce ever enacted</s>  i am watching withconsiderable interest to ascertain what figure the freestate democratscut in the concern</s>  of course they votedall democrats do theirdutyand of course they did not vote for slavestate candidates</s>  we soonshall know how many delegates they elected how many candidates they hadpledged to a free state and how many votes were cast for them</s> allow me to barely whisper my suspicion that there were no such things inkansas as freestate democratsthat they were altogether mythical goodonly to figure in newspapers and speeches in the free states</s>  if thereshould prove to be one real living freestate democrat in kansas isuggest that it might be well to catch him and stuff and preserve hisskin as an interesting specimen of that soontobe extinct variety of thegenus democrat</s> and now as to the dred scott decision</s>  that decision declares twopropositionsfirst that a negro cannot sue in the united states courtsand secondly that congress cannot prohibit slavery in the territories</s>  itwas made by a divided court dividing differently on the different points</s> judge douglas does not discuss the merits of the decision and in thatrespect i shall follow his example believing i could no more improve onmclean and curtis than he could on taney</s> he denounces all who question the correctness of that decision asoffering violent resistance to it</s>  but who resists it</s>  who has in spiteof the decision declared dred scott free and resisted the authority ofhis master over him</s> judicial decisions have two usesfirst to absolutely determine the casedecided and secondly to indicate to the public how other similar caseswill be decided when they arise</s>  for the latter use they are calledprecedents and authorities</s> we believe as much as judge douglas perhaps more in obedience to andrespect for the judicial department of government</s>  we think its decisionson constitutional questions when fully settled should control not onlythe particular cases decided but the general policy of the countrysubject to be disturbed only by amendments of the constitution as providedin that instrument itself</s>  more than this would be revolution</s>  but wethink the dred scott decision is erroneous</s>  we know the court that made ithas often overruled its own decisions and we shall do what we can to haveit to overrule this</s>  we offer no resistance to it</s> judicial decisions are of greater or less authority as precedentsaccording to circumstances</s>  that this should be so accords both withcommon sense and the customary understanding of the legal profession</s>
if this important decision had been made by the unanimous concurrence ofthe judges and without any apparent partisan bias and in accordance withlegal public expectation and with the steady practice of the departmentsthroughout our history and had been in no part based on assumedhistorical facts which are not really true or if wanting in some ofthese it had been before the court more than once and had there beenaffirmed and reaffirmed through a course of years it then might beperhaps would be factious nay even revolutionary not to acquiesce init as a precedent</s> but when as is true we find it wanting in all these claims to the publicconfidence it is not resistance it is not factious it is not evendisrespectful to treat it as not having yet quite established a settleddoctrine for the country</s>  but judge douglas considers this view awful</s> hear himthe courts are the tribunals prescribed by the constitution and createdby the authority of the people to determine expound and enforce the law</s> hence whoever resists the final decision of the highest judicial tribunalaims a deadly blow at our whole republican system of governmenta blowwhich if successful would place all our rights and liberties at themercy of passion anarchy and violence</s>  i repeat therefore that ifresistance to the decisions of the supreme court of the united states ina matter like the points decided in the dred scott case clearly withintheir jurisdiction as defined by the constitution shall be forced uponthe country as a political issue it will become a distinct and nakedissue between the friends and enemies of the constitutionthe friends andthe enemies of the supremacy of the laws</s> why this same supreme court once decided a national bank to beconstitutional but general jackson as president of the united statesdisregarded the decision and vetoed a bill for a recharter partly onconstitutional ground declaring that each public functionary must supportthe constitution as he understands it</s>  but hear the generals own words</s> here they are taken from his veto messageit is maintained by the advocates of the bank that its constitutionalityin all its features ought to be considered as settled by precedent andby the decision of the supreme court</s>  to this conclusion i cannot assent</s> mere precedent is a dangerous source of authority and should not beregarded as deciding questions of constitutional power except wherethe acquiescence of the people and the states can be considered as wellsettled</s>  so far from this being the case on this subject an argumentagainst the bank might be based on precedent</s>  one congress in 1791decided in favor of a bank another in 1811 decided against it</s>  onecongress in 1815 decided against a bank another in 1816 decided inits favor</s>  prior to the present congress therefore the precedents drawnfrom that course were equal</s>  if we resort to the states the expressionsof legislative judicial and executive opinions against the bank havebeen probably to those in its favor as four to one</s>  there is nothing inprecedent therefore which if its authority were admitted ought toweigh in favor of the act before me</s> i drop the quotations merely to remark that all there ever was in the wayof precedent up to the dred scott decision on the points therein decidedhad been against that decision</s>  but hear general jackson furtherif the opinion of the supreme court covered the whole ground of this actit ought not to control the coordinate authorities of this government</s>  thecongress the executive and the courts must each for itself be guidedby its own opinion of the constitution</s>  each public officer who takesan oath to support the constitution swears that he will support it as heunderstands it and not as it is understood by others</s> again and again have i heard judge douglas denounce that bank decision andapplaud general jackson for disregarding it</s>  it would be interestingfor him to look over his recent speech and see how exactly his fiercephilippics against us for resisting supreme court decisions fall upon hisown head</s>  it will call to mind a long and fierce political war in thiscountry upon an issue which in his own language and of course in hisown changeless estimation was a distinct issue between the friends andthe enemies of the constitution and in which war he fought in the ranksof the enemies of the constitution</s> i have said in substance that the dred scott decision was in part basedon assumed historical facts which were not really true and i ought not toleave the subject without giving some reasons for saying this i thereforegive an instance or two which i think fully sustain me</s>  chief justicetaney in delivering the opinion of the majority of the court insists atgreat length that negroes were no part of the people who made or forwhom was made the declaration of independence or the constitution of theunited states</s> on the contrary judge curtis in his dissenting opinion shows that infive of the then thirteen statesto wit new hampshire massachusettsnew york new jersey and north carolinafree negroes were voters and inproportion to their numbers had the same part in making the constitutionthat the white people had</s>  he shows this with so much particularity as toleave no doubt of its truth and as a sort of conclusion on that pointholds the following languagethe constitution was ordained and established by the people of the unitedstates through the action in each state of those persons who werequalified by its laws to act thereon in behalf of themselves and all othercitizens of the state</s>  in some of the states as we have seen coloredpersons were among those qualified by law to act on the subject</s>  thesecolored persons were not only included in the body of the people of theunited states by whom the constitution was ordained and established butin at least five of the states they had the power to act and doubtlessdid act by their suffrages upon the question of its adoption</s> again chief justice taney saysit is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion inrelation to that unfortunate race which prevailed in the civilizedand enlightened portions of the world at the time of the declaration ofindependence and when the constitution of the united states was framedand adopted</s> and again after quoting from the declaration he saysthe general words above quoted would seem to include the whole humanfamily and if they were used in a similar instrument at this day wouldbe so understood</s> in these the chief justice does not directly assert but plainly assumesas a fact that the public estimate of the black man is more favorable nowthan it was in the days of the revolution</s>  this assumption is a mistake</s> in some trifling particulars the condition of that race has beenameliorated but as a whole in this country the change between thenand now is decidedly the other way and their ultimate destiny has neverappeared so hopeless as in the last three or four years</s>  in two of thefive statesnew jersey and north carolinathat then gave the freenegro the right of voting the right has since been taken away and ina thirdnew yorkit has been greatly abridged while it has not beenextended so far as i know to a single additional state thoughthe number of the states has more than doubled</s>  in those days as iunderstand masters could at their own pleasure emancipate their slavesbut since then such legal restraints have been made upon emancipationas to amount almost to prohibition</s>  in those days legislatures held theunquestioned power to abolish slavery in their respective states but nowit is becoming quite fashionable for state constitutions to withhold thatpower from the legislatures</s>  in those days by common consent the spreadof the black mans bondage to the new countries was prohibited butnow congress decides that it will not continue the prohibition and thesupreme court decides that it could not if it would</s>  in those days ourdeclaration of independence was held sacred by all and thought to includeall but now to aid in making the bondage of the negro universal andeternal it is assailed and sneered at and construed and hawked at andtorn till if its framers could rise from their graves they could not atall recognize it</s>  all the powers of earth seem rapidly combining againsthim</s>  mammon is after him ambition follows philosophy follows and thetheology of the day fast joining the cry</s>  they have him in his prisonhouse they have searched his person and left no prying instrument withhim</s>  one after another they have closed the heavy iron doors upon himand now they have him as it were bolted in with a lock of hundred keyswhich can never be unlocked without the concurrence of every keythe keysin the hands of a hundred different men and they scattered to hundreddifferent and distant places and they stand musing as to what inventionin all the dominions of mind and matter can be produced to make theimpossibility of his escape more complete than it is</s> it is grossly incorrect to say or assume that the public estimate of thenegro is more favorable now than it was at the origin of the government</s> three years and a half ago judge douglas brought forward his famousnebraska bill</s>  the country was at once in a blaze</s>  he scorned allopposition and carried it through congress</s>  since then he has seenhimself superseded in a presidential nomination by one indorsing thegeneral doctrine of his measure but at the same time standing clearof the odium of its untimely agitation and its gross breach of nationalfaith and he has seen that successful rival constitutionally elected notby the strength of friends but by the division of adversaries being ina popular minority of nearly four hundred thousand votes</s>  he has seen hischief aids in his own state shields and richardson politically speakingsuccessively tried convicted and executed for an offence not their ownbut his</s>  and now he sees his own case standing next on the docket fortrial</s> there is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people at theidea of an indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races andjudge douglas evidently is basing his chief hope upon the chances of hisbeing able to appropriate the benefit of this disgust to himself</s>  if hecan by much drumming and repeating fasten the odium of that idea uponhis adversaries he thinks he can struggle through the storm</s>  he thereforeclings to this hope as a drowning man to the last plank</s>  he makes anoccasion for lugging it in from the opposition to the dred scott decision</s> he finds the republicans insisting that the declaration of independenceincludes all men black as well as white and forthwith he boldly deniesthat it includes negroes at all and proceeds to argue gravely that allwho contend it does do so only because they want to vote and eatand sleep and marry with negroes</s>  he will have it that they cannotbe consistent else</s>  now i protest against the counterfeit logic whichconcludes that because i do not want a black woman for a slave i mustnecessarily want her for a wife</s>  i need not have her for either</s>  i canjust leave her alone</s>  in some respects she certainly is not my equalbut in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own handswithout asking leave of any one else she is my equal and the equal of allothers</s> chief justice taney in his opinion in the dred scott case admits thatthe language of the declaration is broad enough to include the whole humanfamily but he and judge douglas argue that the authors of that instrumentdid not intend to include negroes by the fact that they did not atonce actually place them on an equality with the whites</s>  now this graveargument comes to just nothing at all by the other fact that they did notat once or ever afterward actually place all white people on an equalitywith one another</s>  and this is the staple argument of both the chiefjustice and the senator for doing this obvious violence to the plainunmistakable language of the declaration</s> i think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include allmen but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects</s> they did not mean to say all were equal in color size intellect moraldevelopments or social capacity</s>  they defined with tolerable distinctnessin what respects they did consider all men created equalequal withcertain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and thepursuit of happiness</s>  this they said and this they meant</s>  they did notmean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoyingthat equality nor yet that they were about to confer it immediately uponthem</s>  in fact they had no power to confer such a boon</s>  they meant simplyto declare the right so that enforcement of it might follow as fast ascircumstances should permit</s> they meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should befamiliar to all and revered by all constantly looked to constantlylabored for and even though never perfectly attained constantlyapproximated and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influenceand augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people of all colorseverywhere</s>  the assertion that all men are created equal was of nopractical use in effecting our separation from great britain and it wasplaced in the declaration not for that but for future use</s>  its authorsmeant it to beas thank god it is now proving itselfstumblingblockto all those who in after times might seek to turn a free people back intothe hateful paths of despotism</s>  they knew the proneness of prosperity tobreed tyrants and they meant when such should reappear in this fair landand commence their vocation they should find left for them at least onehard nut to crack</s> i have now briefly expressed my view of the meaning and object of thatpart of the declaration of independence which declares that all men arecreated equal</s> now let us hear judge douglass view of the same subject as i find it inthe printed report of his late speech</s>  here it isno man can vindicate the character motives and conduct of the signersof the declaration of independence except upon the hypothesis thatthey referred to the white race alone and not to the african when theydeclared all men to have been created equal that they were speaking ofbritish subjects on this continent being equal to british subjectsborn and residing in great britain that they were entitled to the sameinalienable rights and among them were enumerated life liberty andthe pursuit of happiness</s>  the declaration was adopted for the purpose ofjustifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized world in withdrawingtheir allegiance from the british crown and dissolving their connectionwith the mother country</s> my good friends read that carefully over some leisure hour and ponderwell upon it see what a mere wreckmangled ruinit makes of our onceglorious declaration</s> they were speaking of british subjects on this continent being equal tobritish subjects born and residing in great britain</s>  why accordingto this not only negroes but white people outside of great britain andamerica were not spoken of in that instrument</s>  the english irish andscotch along with white americans were included to be sure but thefrench germans and other white people of the world are all gone to potalong with the judges inferior races</s> i had thought the declaration promised something better than the conditionof british subjects but no it only meant that we should be equal to themin their own oppressed and unequal condition</s>  according to that it gaveno promise that having kicked off the king and lords of great britain weshould not at once be saddled with a king and lords of our own</s> i had thought the declaration contemplated the progressive improvement inthe condition of all men everywhere but no it merely was adopted forthe purpose of justifying the colonists in the eyes of the civilized worldin withdrawing their allegiance from the british crown and dissolvingtheir connection with the mother country</s>  why that object having beeneffected some eighty years ago the declaration is of no practical usenowmere rubbishold wadding left to rot on the battlefield after thevictory is won</s> i understand you are preparing to celebrate the fourth tomorrow week</s> what for</s>  the doings of that day had no reference to the present andquite half of you are not even descendants of those who were referred

douglass version</s>  itwill then run thuswe hold these truths to be selfevident that all british subjects whowere on this continent eightyone years ago were created equal to allbritish subjects born and then residing in great britain</s> and now i appeal to allto democrats as well as othersare you reallywilling that the declaration shall thus be frittered away</s> thus left nomore at most than an interesting memorial of the dead past</s> thus shornof its vitality and practical value and left without the germ or even thesuggestion of the individual rights of man in it</s> but judge douglas is especially horrified at the thought of the mixingof blood by the white and black races</s>  agreed for oncea thousand timesagreed</s>  there are white men enough to marry all the white women and blackmen enough to many all the black women and so let them be married</s>  onthis point we fully agree with the judge and when he shall show that hispolicy is better adapted to prevent amalgamation than ours we shall dropours and adopt his</s>  let us see</s>  in 1850 there were in the united states405751 mulattoes</s>  very few of these are the offspring of whites and freeblacks nearly all have sprung from black slaves and white masters</s>  aseparation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamationbut as an immediate separation is impossible the next best thing is tokeep them apart where they are not already together</s>  if white and blackpeople never get together in kansas they will never mix blood in kansas</s> that is at least one selfevident truth</s>  a few free colored personsmay get into the free states in any event but their number is tooinsignificant to amount to much in the way of mixing blood</s>  in 1850 therewere in the free states 56649 mulattoes but for the most part they werenot born therethey came from the slave states ready made up</s>  in thesame year the slave states had 348874 mulattoes all of home production</s> the proportion of free mulattoes to free blacksthe only colored classesin the free states is much greater in the slave than in the free states</s> it is worthy of note too that among the free states those which make

source of amalgamationand next to it not the elevation but the degradation of the freeblacks</s>  yet judge douglas dreads the slightest restraints on the spreadof slavery and the slightest human recognition of the negro as tendinghorribly to amalgamation</s> the very dred scott case affords a strong test as to which party mostfavors amalgamation the republicans or the dear unionsaving

whether they were free or not andthen also that they were in fact and in law really free</s>  could we havehad our way the chances of these black girls ever mixing their blood withthat of white people would have been diminished at least to the extentthat it could not have been without their consent</s>  but judge douglas isdelighted to have them decided to be slaves and not human enough to havea hearing even if they were free and thus left subject to the forcedconcubinage of their masters and liable to become the mothers ofmulattoes in spite of themselves the very state of case that producesnine tenths of all the mulattoes all the mixing of blood in the nation</s> of course i state this case as an illustration only not meaning to sayor intimate that the master of dred scott and his family or any morethan a percentage of masters generally are inclined to exercise thisparticular power which they hold over their female slaves</s> i have said that the separation of the races is

navigation was closed four days short of four months last year andduring this time while the river was of no use this road and bridge werevaluable</s>  there is too a considerable portion of time when floating orthin ice makes the river useless while the bridge is as useful as ever</s> this shows that this bridge must be treated with respect in this court andis not to be kicked about with contempt</s>  the other day judge wead alludedto the strike of the contending interest and even a dissolution of theunion</s>  the proper mode for all parties in this affair is to live and letlive and

measuredat the pier is seven degrees that is we would have to move the pierseven degrees to make it exactly straight with the current</s>  would thatmake the navigation better or worse</s>  the witnesses of the plaintiff seemto think it was only necessary to say that the pier formed an angle withthe current and that settled the matter</s>  our more careful and accuratewitnesses say that though they had been accustomed to seeing the piersplaced straight with the current yet they could see that here the currenthad been made straight by us in having made this slight angle that thewater

make himself acquainted with the place</s> mccammon says that the current and the swell coming from the long pierdrove her against the long pier</s>  in other words drove her toward the verypier from which the current came</s>  it is an absurdity an impossibility</s> the only recollection i can find for this contradiction is in a currentwhich white says strikes out from the long pier and then like a rams hornturns back and this might have acted somehow in this manner</s> it is agreed by all that the plaintiffs boat was destroyed and that itwas destroyed upon the head of the short pier that she moved from thechannel where she was with her bow above the head of the long pier tillshe struck the short one swung around under the bridge and there wascrowded and destroyed</s> i shall try to prove that the average velocity of the current through thedraw with the boat in it should be five and a half miles an hour that itis slowest at the head of the pier and swiftest at the foot of the pier</s>

the stern of the afton to the splash doorand thus it appears that she had but forty feet to go to clear the pier</s> how was it that the afton with all her power flanked over from the channelto the short pier without moving one foot ahead</s>  suppose she was in themiddle of the draw her wheel would have been 31 feet from the short pier</s> the reason she went over thus is her starboard wheel was not working</s>  ishall try to establish the fact that the wheel was not running and thatafter she struck she went ahead strong on this same wheel</s>  upon the lastpoint the witnesses agree that the starboard wheel was running after shestruck and no witnesses say that it was running while she was out in thedraw flanking over</s> mr</s>  lincoln read from the testimonies of various witnesses to prove thatthe starboard wheel was not working while the afton was out in the stream</s> other witnesses show that the captain said something of the machinery ofthe wheel and the inference is that he knew the wheel was not working</s> the fact is undisputed that she did not move one inch ahead while she wasmoving this 31 feet sideways</s>  there is evidence proving that the currentthere is only five miles an hour and the only explanation is that herpower was not all usedthat only one wheel was working</s>  the pilot sayshe ordered the engineers to back her up</s>  the engineers differ from himand said they kept on going ahead</s>  the bow was so swung that the currentpressed it over the pilot pressed the stern over with the rudder thoughnot so fast but that the bow gained on it and only one wheel beingin motion the boat nearly stood still so far as motion up and down isconcerned and thus she was thrown upon this pier</s>  the afton came into thedraw after she had just passed the carson and as the carson no doubt keptthe true course the afton going around her got out of the proper way gotacross the current into the eddy which is west of a straight line drawndown from the long pier was compelled to resort to these changes ofwheels which she did not do with sufficient adroitness to save her</s>  wasit not her own fault that she entered wrong so far wrong that she nevergot right</s>  is the defence to blame for that</s> for several days we were entertained with depositions about boatssmelling a bar</s>  why did the afton then after she had come up smellingso close to the long pier sheer off so strangely</s>  when she got to thecentre of the very nose she was smelling she seemed suddenly to have losther sense of smell and to have flanked over to the short pier</s> mr</s>  lincoln said there was no practicability in the project of buildinga tunnel under the river for there is not a tunnel that is a successfulproject in this world</s>  a suspension bridge cannot be built so high butthat the chimneys of the boats will grow up till they cannot pass</s>  thesteamboat men will take pains to make them grow</s>  the cars of a railroadcannot without immense expense rise high enough to get even with asuspension bridge or go low enough to get through a tunnel such expenseis unreasonable</s> the plaintiffs have to establish that the bridge is a materialobstruction and that they have managed their boat with reasonable care andskill</s>  as to the last point high winds have nothing to do with it for itwas not a windy day</s>  they must show due skill and care</s>  difficulties goingdown stream will not do for they were going up stream</s>  difficultieswith barges in tow have nothing to do with the accident for they had nobarge</s>  mr</s>  lincoln said he had
