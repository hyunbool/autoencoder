stopped on the summit of thatlong descent where the road pitches from the elevated plain of moudon inswitzerland to the level of the lake of geneva immediately above thelittle city of vvey</s>  the postilion had dismounted to chain a wheel andthe halt enabled those he conducted to catch a glimpse of the lovelyscenery of that remarkable view</s> the travellers were an american family which had long been wanderingabout europe and which was now destined it knew not whither having justtraversed a thousand miles of germany in its devious course</s>  four yearsbefore the same family had halted on the same spot nearly on the sameday of the month of october and for precisely the same object</s>  it wasthen journeying to italy and as its members hung over the view of theleman with its accessories of chillon chtelard blonay meillerie thepeaks of savoy and the wild ranges of the alps they had felt regret thatthe fairy scene was so soon to pass away</s>  the case was now different andyielding to the charm of a nature so noble and yet so soft within a fewhours the carriage was in remise a house was taken the baggageunpacked and the household gods of the travellers were erected for thetwentieth time in a strange land</s> our american for the family had its head was familiar with the oceanand the sight of water awoke old and pleasant recollections</s>  he washardly established in vvey as a housekeeper before he sought a boat</s> chance brought him to a certain jean descloux we give the spelling athazard with whom he soon struck up a bargain and they launched forth incompany upon the lake</s> this casual meeting was the commencement of an agreeable and friendlyintercourse</s>  jean descloux besides being a very good boatman was arespectable philosopher in his way possessing a tolerable stock ofgeneral information</s>  his knowledge of america in particular might bedeemed a little remarkable</s>  he knew it was a continent which lay west ofhis own quarter of the world that it had a place in it called new vveythat all the whites who had gone there were not yet black and that therewere plausible hopes it might one day be civilized</s>  finding jean soenlightened on a subject under which most of the eastern savans breakdown the american thought it well enough to prick him closely on othermatters</s>  the worthy boatman turned out to be a man of singularly justdiscrimination</s>  he was a reasonablygood judge of the weather had diversmarvels to relate concerning the doings of the lake thought the city verywrong for not making a port in the

singularly bad roads in vaud while those around its owncity were the best in europe and otherwise showed himself to be adiscreet and observant man</s>  in short honest jean descloux was a fairsample of that homebred upright commonsense which seems to form theinstinct of the mass and which it is greatly the fashion to deride inthose circles in which mystification passes for profound thinking boldassumption for evidence a simper for wit particular personal advantagesfor liberty and in which it is deemed a mortal offence against goodmanners to hint that adam and eve were the common parents of mankind</s> monsieur has chosen a good time to visit vvey observed jean desclouxone evening that they were drifting in front of the town the wholescenery resembling a fairy picture rather than a portion of thismuchabused earth it blows sometimes at this end of the lake in a way tofrighten the gulls out of it</s>  we shall see no more of the steamboat afterthe last of the month</s> the american cast a glance at the mountain drew upon his memory forsundry squalls and gales which he had seen himself and thought theboatmans figure of speech less extravagant than it had at first seemed</s> if your lake craft were better constructed they would make betterweather he quietly observed</s> monsieur descloux had no wish to quarrel with a customer who employed himevery evening and who preferred floating with the current to being rowedwith a crooked oar</s>  he manifested his prudence therefore by making areserved reply</s> no doubt monsieur he said that the people who live on the sea makebetter vessels and know how to sail them more skilfully</s>  we had a proofof that here at vvey he pronounced the word like vvais agreeablyto the sounds of the french vowels last summer

on his way back in the dark and it came on to blowhere from off the mountains and he stood on boldly towards our shoreheaving the lead as he drew near the land as if he had been beating intospithead

the lake has a bottom notwithstanding</s> your pardon monsieur</s>  the lake has no bottom</s>  the sea may have a bottombut we have no bottom here</s> there was little use in disputing the point</s> monsieur descloux then spoke of the revolutions he had seen</s>  he rememberedthe time when vaud was a province of berne</s>  his observations on thissubject were rational and were well seasoned with wholesome common sense</s> his doctrine was simply this</s>  if one man rule he will rule for his ownbenefit and that of his parasites if a minority rule we have manymasters instead of one honest jean had got hold here of a cant sayingof the privileged which he very ingeniously converted againstthemselves all of whom must be fed and served and if the majorityrule and ruled wrongfully why the minimum of harm is done</s>  he admittedthat the people might be deceived to their own injury but then he didnot think it was quite as likely to happen as that they should beoppressed when they were governed without any agency of their own</s>  onthese points the american and the vaudois were absolutely of the samemind</s> from politics the transition to poetry was natural for a commoningredient in both would seem to be fiction</s>  on the subject of hismountains monsieur descloux was a thorough swiss</s>  he expatiated on theirgrandeur their storms their height and their glaciers with eloquence</s> the worthy boatman had some such opinions of the superiority of his owncountry as all are apt to form who have never seen any other</s>  he dwelt onthe glories of an abbaye des vignerons too with the gusto of a vvaisanand seemed to think it would be a high stroke of state policy to get up anew fte of this kind as speedily as possible</s>  in short the world andits interests were pretty generally discussed between these twophilosophers during an intercourse that extended to a month</s> our american was not a man to let instruction of this nature easily escapehim</s>  he lay hours at a time on the seats of jean desclouxs boat lookingup at the mountains or watching some lazy sail on the lake andspeculating on the wisdom of which he was so accidentally made therepository</s>  his view on one side was limited by the glacier of mont vlana near neighbor of the celebrated col of st</s>  bernard and on the otherhis eye could range to the smiling fields that surround geneva</s>  withinthis setting is contained one of the most magnificent pictures that natureever drew and he bethought him of the human actions passions andinterests of which it might have been the scene</s>  by a connexion that wasnatural enough to the situation he imagined a fragment of life passedbetween these grand limits and the manner in which men could listen tothe neverwearied promptings of their impulses in the immediate presenceof the majesty of the creator</s>  he bethought him of the analogies thatexist between inanimate nature and our own wayward inequalities of thefearful admixture of good and evil of which we are composed of the mannerin which the best betray their submission to the devils and in which theworst have gleams of that eternal principle of right by which they havebeen endowed by god of those tempests which sometimes lie dormant in oursystems like the slumbering lake in the calm but which excited equalits fury when lashed by the winds of the strength of prejudices of theworthlessness and changeable character of the most cherished of ouropinions and of that strange incomprehensible and yet winning mlangeof contradictions of fallacies of

navigation of the lakes of italy and switzerland itis true but time even at this hour has done little towards changing thehabits and opinions of those who ply on these inland waters for asubsistence</s>  the winkelried had the two low diverging masts theattenuated and picturesquelypoised latine yards the light triangularsails the sweeping and projecting gangways the receding and

the hull was worthy of somuch goodly apparel being spacious commodious and according to thewants of the navigation of approved mould</s>  the freight which wassufficiently obvious much the greatest part being piled on the ampledeck consisted of what our own watermen would term an assorted cargo</s>  itwas however chiefly composed of those foreign luxuries as they werethen called though use has now rendered them nearly indispensable todomestic economy which were consumed in singular moderation by the moreaffluent of those who dwelt deeper among the mountains and of the twoprincipal products of the dairy the latter being destined to a market inthe less verdant countries of the south</s>  to these must be added thepersonal effects of an unusual number of passengers which were stowed onthe top of the heavier part of the cargo with an order and care thattheir value would scarcely seem to require</s>  the arrangement however wasnecessary to the convenience and even to the security of the bark havingbeen made by the patron with a view to posting each individual by hisparticular wallet in a manner to prevent confusion in the crowd and toleave the crew space and opportunity to discharge the necessary duties ofthe navigation</s> with a vessel stowed sails ready to drop the wind fair and the daydrawing on apace the patron of the winkelried who was also her ownerfelt a very natural wish to depart</s>  but an unlookedfor obstacle had justpresented itself at the watergate where the officer charged with theduty of looking into the characters of all who went and came was postedand around whom some fifty representatives of half as many nations werenow clustered in a clamorous throng filling the air with a confusion oftongues that had some probable affinity to the noises which deranged theworkmen of babel</s>  it appeared by parts of sentences and brokenremonstrances equally addressed to the patron whose name was baptisteand to the guardian of the genevese laws a rumor was rife among thesetruculent travellers that balthazar the headsman or executioner of thepowerful and aristocratical canton of berne was about to be smuggled intotheir company by the cupidity of the former contrary not only to whatwas due to the feelings and rights of men of more creditable callingsbut as it was vehemently and plausibly insisted to the very safety ofthose who were about to trust their fortunes to the vicissitudes of theelements</s> chance and the ingenuity of baptiste had collected on this occasion aspartycolored and heterogeneous an assemblage of human passionsinterests dialects

all fairrepresentationthe majority</s>  those who remained were of a differentcaste</s>  near the noisy crowd of tossing heads and brandished arms in andaround the gate was a party containing the venerable and still finefigure of a man in the travelling dress of one of superior condition andwho did not need the testimony of the two or three liveried menials thatstood near his person to give an assurance of his belonging to the morefortunate of his fellowcreatures as good and evil are usually estimatedin calculating the chances of life</s>  on his arm leaned a female so youngand yet so lovely as to cause regret in all who observed her fadingcolor the sweet but melancholy smile that occasionally lighted her mildand pleasing features at some of the more marked exuberances of follyamong the crowd and a form which notwithstanding her lessened bloom wasnearly perfect</s>  if these symptoms of delicate health did not prevent thisfair girl from being amused at the volubility

that from time to time were addressed to him bythe others in a manner to show he was an intimate acquaintance thoughthere were signs about his travelling equipage to prove he was not exactlyof their ordinary society</s>  of all who were not immediately engaged in theboisterous discussion at the gate this young soldier who was commonlyaddressed by those near him as monsieur sigismund was much the mostinterested in its progress</s>  though of herculean frame and evidently ofunusual physical force he was singularly agitated</s>  his cheek which hadnot yet lost the freshness due to the mountain air would at timesbecome pale as that of the wilting flower near him while at others theblood rushed across his brow in a torrent that seemed to threaten arupture of the starting vessels in which it so tumultuously flowed</s>  unlessaddressed however he said nothing his distress gradually subsidinguntil it was merely betrayed by the convulsive writhings of his fingerswhich unconsciously grasped the hilt of his sword</s> the uproar had now continued for some time throats were getting soretongues clammy voices hoarse and words incoherent when a sudden checkwas given to the useless clamor by an incident quite in unison with thedisturbance itself</s>  two enormous dogs were in attendance hard byapparently awaiting the movements of their respective masters who werelost to view in the mass of heads and bodies that stopped the passage ofthe gate</s>  one of these animals was covered with a short thick coating ofhair whose prevailing color was a dingy yellow but whose throat andlegs with most of the inferior parts of the body were of a dull white</s> nature on the other hand had given a dusky brownish shaggy dress tohis rival though his general hue was relieved by a few shades of a moredecided black</s>  as respects weight and force of body the differencebetween the brutes was not very obvious though perhaps it slightlyinclined in favor of the former who in length if not in strength oflimb however had more manifestly the advantage</s> it would much exceed the intelligence we have brought to this task toexplain how far the instincts of the dogs sympathised in the savagepassions of the human beings around them or whether they were consciousthat their masters had espoused opposite sides in the quarrel and that itbecame them as faithful esquires to tilt together by way of supportingthe honor of those they followed but after measuring each other for theusual period with the eye they came violently together body to body inthe manner of their species</s>  the collision was fearful and the strugglebeing between two creatures of so great size and strength of the fiercestkind</s>  the roar resembled that of lions effectually drowning the clamor ofhuman

furious brutes were on the pointof tearing each other in pieces the crowd was pushed violently open andtwo men burst side by side out of the mass</s>  one wore the black robesthe conical asiaticlooking tufted cap and the white belt of anaugustine monk and the other had the attire of a man addicted to theseas without however being so decidedly maritime as to leave hischaracter a matter

the other hand the italian did not stop to expostulate but throwinghimself with reckless hardihood on the dogs by dint of kicks and blowsof which much the heaviest portion fell on the follower of the

wellknownnewfoundland breed hung his head and made signs of contrition bydrawing nearer to his master with a tail that swept the ground while hislate adversary quietly seated himself with a species of monastic dignitylooking from the speaker to his foe as if endeavoring to comprehend therebuke which his powerful and gallant antagonist took so meekly</s> father said the italian our dogs are both too

we can count little more in favor of the dogthan a good intention</s>  valuing services on this scale i might ere thishave been the holy father himself or at least a cardinal but seven livessaved for

forthirteen drowning men have i myself seen him draw from the greedy jaws ofsharks and other monsters of deep water</s>  what dost thou say father shallwe make peace between the brutes</s> the augustine expressed his readiness as well as his desire to aid in aneffort so laudable and by dint of commands and persuasion the dogs whowere predisposed to peace from having had a mutual taste of the bitternessof war and who now felt for each other the respect which courage andforce are apt to create were soon on the usual terms of animals of theirkind that have no particular grounds for contention</s> the guardian of the city improved the calm produced by this littleincident to regain a portion of his lost authority</s>  beating back thecrowd with his cane he cleared a space around the gate into which butone of the travellers could enter at a time while he professed himselfnot only ready but determined to proceed with his duty without furtherprocrastination</s>  baptiste the patron who beheld the precious momentswasting and who in the delay foresaw a loss of wind which to one ofhis pursuits was loss of money now earnestly pressed the travellers tocomply with the necessary forms and to take their stations in his barkwith all convenient speed</s> of what matter is it continued the calculating waterman who was ratherconspicuously known for the love of thrift that is usually attributed tomost of the inhabitants of that region whether there be one headsman ortwenty in the bark so long as the good vessel can float and steer</s>  ourleman winds are fickle friends and the wise take them while in the humor</s> give me the breeze at west and i will load the winkelried to the watersedge with executioners or any other pernicious creatures thou wilt andthou mayest take the lightest bark that ever swam in the bise and letus see who will first make the haven of vvey</s> the loudest and in a sense that is very important in all suchdiscussions the principal speaker in the dispute was the leader of theneapolitan troupe who in virtue of good lungs an agility that had nocompetitor in any present and a certain mixture of superstition andbravado that formed nearly equal ingredients in his character was a manlikely to gain great influence with those who from their ignorance andhabits had an inherent love of the marvellous and a profound respect forall who possessed in acting more audacity and in believing morecredulity than themselves</s>  the vulgar like an excess even if it be offolly for in their eyes the abundance of any particular quality isvery apt to be taken as the standard of its excellence</s> this is well for him who receives but it may be death to him that payscried the son of the south gaining not a little among his auditors by thedistinction for the argument was sufficiently wily as between the buyerand the seller</s>  thou wilt get thy silver for the risk and we may getwatery graves for our weakness</s>  nought but mishaps can come of

fairly up</s>  santamadre</s>  i would not be the fellowtraveller of such a wretch across thiswild and changeable lake for the honor of leaping and showing my poorpowers in the presence of the holy father and the whole of the learnedconclave</s> this solemn declaration which was made with suitable gesticulation andan action of the countenance that was well adapted to prove the speakerssincerity produced a corresponding effect on most of the listeners whomurmured their applause in a manner sufficiently significant to convincethe patron he was not about to dispose of the difficulty simply by virtueof fair words</s>  in this dilemma he bethought him of a plan of overcomingthe scruples of all present in which he was warmly seconded by the agentof the police and to which after the usual number of cavillingobjections that were generated by distrust heated blood and theobstinacy of disputation the other parties were finally induced to givetheir consent</s>  it was agreed that the examination should no longer bedelayed but that a species of deputation from the crowd might take theirstand within the gate where all who passed would necessarily be subjectto their scrutiny and in the event of their vigilance detecting theabhorred and proscribed balthazar that the patron should return his moneyto the headsman and preclude him from forming one of a party that was soscrupulous of its association and apparently with so little reason</s>  theneapolitan whose name was pippo one of the indigent scholars for acentury since learning was rather the auxiliary than the foe ofsuperstition and a certain nicklaus wagner a fat bernese who was theowner of most of the cheeses in the bark were the chosen of the multitudeon this occasion</s>  the first owed his election to his vehemence andvolubility qualities that the ignoble vulgar are very apt to mistake forconviction and knowledge the second to his silence and a demureness ofair which pass with another class for the stillness of deep water and thelast to his substance as a man of known wealth an advantage which inspite of all that alarmists predict on one side and enthusiasts affirm onthe other will always carry greater weight with those who are lessfortunate in this respect than is either reasonable or morally healthfulprovided it is not abused by arrogance or by the assumption of veryextravagant and oppressive privileges</s>  as a matter of course thesedeputed guardians of the common rights were first obliged to submit theirown papers to the eye of the genevese</s> 1 footnote 1 as we have so often alluded to this examination it may be well to explain that the present system of gendarmerie and passports did not then prevail in europe taking their rise nearly a century later than that in which the events of this tale had place</s>  but geneva was a small and exposed state and the regulation to which there is reference here was one of the provisions which were resorted to from time to

morepetty wrongs did not present himself that day at the watergate wasregularly fortified by every precaution that the long experience of avagabond could suggest and he was permitted to pass forthwith</s>  the poorwestphalian student presented an instrument fairly written out inscholastic latin and escaped further trouble by the vanity of theunlettered agent of the police who hastily affirmed it was a pleasure toencounter documents so perfectly in form</s>  but the bernese was about totake his station by the side of the other two appearing to think inquiryin his case unnecessary</s>  while moving through the passage in statelysilence nicklaus wagner was occupied in securing the strings of a wellfilled purse which he had just lightened of a small copper coin toreward the varlet of the hostelry in which he had passed the night andwho had been obliged to follow him to the port to obtain even this scantyboon and the genevese was fain to believe that in the urgency of thisimportant concern he had overlooked those forms which all were justthen obliged to respect on quitting the town</s>

of vvey was peter hofmeister a member of one ofthose families of the brgerschaft or the municipal aristocracy of thecanton which found its institutions venerable just and and if onemight judge from

seventytwo years and a half the preciseperiod of the hard servitude of the hofmeisters and the rare merit oftheir selfdevotion to the common good it would seem that they were somany modern curtii

hersentiments which were however so lively as to have chased the rose fromher cheek in the endeavor to forget them and to have led her sensitivefather to apprehend that she was suffering under that premature decaywhich had already robbed him of his other children</s>  there was in truth noserious ground for this apprehension so natural to one in the place ofthe baron de willading for until thought and reflection paled hercheek a more blooming maiden than adelheid or one that united moreperfect health with feminine delicacy did not dwell among her nativemountains</s>  she had quietly consented to the italian journey in theexpectation that it might serve to divert her mind from brooding over whatshe had long considered hopeless and with the natural desire to see landsso celebrated

idea so grateful to her womanly affections and maidenpridethat the young soldier who was in the service of austria and whohad become known to her in one of his frequent visits to his native landhad gladly seized this favorable occasion to return to his colors</s> circumstances which it is not necessary to recount had enabled adelheidto make the youth acquainted with her father though the interdictions ofher aunt whose imprudence had led to the accident which nearly proved sofatal and from whose consequences she had been saved by sigismundprevented her from explaining all the causes she had for showing himrespect and esteem</s>  perhaps the manner in which this young and imaginativethough sensible girl was compelled to smother a portion of her feelingsgave them intensity and hastened that transition of sentiment fromgratitude to affection which in another case might have only beenproduced by a more open and prolonged association</s>  as it was she scarcelyknew herself how

suddenshades of melancholy there was a strong touch of the humorous in thenative character of the genoese which came so quick upon his more painfulrecollection as greatly to relieve their weight and

rarefied by the warmth of the sun</s>  thisdifference of temperament however so far from lessening their mutualkindness was most probably the real cause of its existence since it iswell known that friendship like love is more apt to be generated byqualities that vary a little from our own than by a perfect homogeneity ofcharacter and disposition which is more liable to give birth to rivalryand contention than when each party has some distinct capital of his ownon which to adventure and with which to keep alive the interest of himwho in that particular feature may be but indifferently

had beenreared with so much skill as to render it difficult to ascertain wherenature ceased and art commenced but it had been transferred a centurybefore the occurrences related in our tale to a more modern portion ofthe buildings that formed the southeastern angle of the wholeconstruction</s>  the room was spacious square simple for such is thefashion of the country and lighted by windows that looked on one sidetowards valais and on the other over the whole of the irregular butlovely declivity to the margin of the leman and along that beautifulsheet embracing hamlet village city castle and purple mountain untilthe view was limited by the hazy jura</s>  the window on the latter side ofthe knights hall had an iron balcony at a giddy height from the groundand in this airy lookout adelheid had taken her seat when afterquitting her father she mounted to the apartment common to all the guestsof the castle</s> we have already alluded generally to the personal appearance and to themoral qualities of the baron de willadings daughter but we now conceiveit necessary to make the reader more intimately acquainted with one who isdestined to act no mean part in the incidents of our tale</s>  it has beensaid that she was pleasing to the eye but her beauty was of a kind thatdepended more on expression on a union of character with feminine gracethan on the vulgar lines of regularity and symmetry</s>  while she had nofeature that was defective she had none that was absolutely faultlessthough all were combined with so much harmony and the soft expression ofthe mild blue eye accorded so well with the gentle play of a sweet mouththat the soul of their owner seemed ready at all times to appear throughthese ingenuous telltales of her thoughts</s>  still maidenly reserve satein constant watch over all and it was when the spectator thought himselfmost in communion with her spirit that he most felt its pure andcorrecting influence</s>  perhaps a cast of high intelligence of a naturalpower to discriminate which much surpassed the limited means accorded tofemales of that age contributed their share to hold those near her inrespect and served in some degree as a mild and wise repellant tocounteract the attractions of her gentleness and candor</s>  in short onecast unexpectedly in her society would not have been slow to infer and hewould have decided correctly that adelheid de willading was a girl ofwarm and tender affections of a playful but regulated fancy of a firmand lofty sense of all her duties whether natural or merely the result ofsocial obligations of melting pity and yet of a habit and quality tothink and act for herself in all those cases in which it was fitting fora maiden of her condition and years to assume such selfcontrol</s> it was now more than a year since adelheid had become fully sensible ofthe force of her attachment for sigismund steinbach and during all thattime she had struggled hard to overcome a feeling which she believed couldlead to no happy result</s>  the declaration of the young man himself adeclaration that was extorted involuntarily and in a moment of powerfulpassion was accompanied by an admission of its uselessness and folly andit first opened her eyes to the state of her own feelings</s>  though she hadlistened as all of her sex will listen even when the passion ishopeless to such words coming from lips they love it was with aselfcommand that enabled her to retain her own secret and with a settledand pious resolution to do that which she believed to be her duty toherself to her father and to sigismund</s>  from that hour she ceased to seehim unless under circumstances when it would have drawn suspicion on hermotives to refuse and while she never appeared to forget her heavyobligations to the youth she firmly denied herself the pleasure of evenmentioning his name when it could be avoided</s>  but of all ungrateful andreluctant tasks that of striving to forget is the least likely tosucceed</s>  adelheid was sustained only by her sense of duty and the desirenot to disappoint her fathers wishes to which habit and custom had givennearly the force of law with maidens of her condition though her reasonand judgment no less than her affections were both strongly enlisted onthe other side</s>  indeed with the single exception of the general unfitnessof a union between two of unequal stations there was nothing todiscredit her choice if that may be termed choice which after all wasmore the result of spontaneous feeling and secret sympathy than of anyother cause unless it were a certain equivocal reserve and a manifestuneasiness whenever allusion was made to the early history and to thefamily of the soldier</s>  this sensitiveness on the part of sigismund hadbeen observed and commented on by others as well as by herself and it hadbeen openly ascribed to the mortification of one who had been thrown bychance into an intimate association that was much superior to what he wasentitled to maintain by birth a weakness but too common and which fewhave strength of mind to resist or sufficient pride to overcome</s>  theintuitive watchfulness of affection however led adelheid to a differentconclusion she saw that he never affected to conceal while with equalgood taste he abstained from obtrusive allusions to the humble nature ofhis origin but she also perceived that there were points of his previoushistory on which he was acutely sensitive and which at first she fearedmust be attributed to the consciousness of acts that his clear perceptionof moral truth condemned and which he could wish forgotten</s>  for some timeadelheid clung to this discovery as to a healthful and proper antidote toher own truant inclinations but native rectitude banished a suspicionwhich had no sufficient ground as equally unworthy of them both</s>  theeffects of a ceaseless mental struggle and of the fruitlessness of herefforts to overcome her tenderness in behalf of sigismund have beendescribed in the fading of her bloom in the painful solicitude of acountenance naturally so sweet and in the settled melancholy of herplayful and mellow eye</s>  these were the real causes of the

elsewhere accorded to maidens of rank that sigismund at first stoodrooted to the ground for he could not imagine the waving of the hand wasmeant for him</s>  adelheid saw his embarrassment and the signal wasrepeated</s>  the young man sprang up the acclivity with the rapidity of thewind and disappeared behind the walls of the castle</s> the barrier of reserve so long and so success fully observed byadelheid was now passed and she felt as if a few short minutes mustdecide her fate</s>  the necessity of making a wide circuit in order to enterthe court still afforded a little time for reflection however and thisshe endeavored to improve by collecting her thoughts and recovering herselfpossession</s> when sigismund entered the knights hall he found the maiden still seatednear the

equal number of young shepherdsalso singing their pastorals the whole exhibiting an active and merrygroup of dancers accustomed to exercise their art on the sward of thealps for in this festival

magnates of the canton were particularly loud intheir plaudits on this repetition of the games for by a process thatwill be easily understood they who had been revelling and taking theirpotations in

inparticular as became his high office and determined character wasunusually talkative and decided both as respects the criticisms andencomiums he uttered on the various performances making as light

stipulated pricehe is to receive per line</s>  indeed the parallel would hold good in morerespects than that of knowledge for his language was unusually captiousand supercilious his tone authoritative

chiming in with the more regular artists a sort ofmusical enthusiasm seized upon all present who came of vaud and hervalleys</s>  the dogmatical but wellmeaning bailiff though usually jealousof his bernese origin and alive on system to the necessity of preservingthe superiority of the great canton by all the common observances ofdignity and reserve yielded to the general movement and shouted with therest under favor of a pair of lungs that nature had admirably fitted tosustain the chorus of a mountain song</s>  this condescension in the deputy ofberne was often spoken of afterwards with admiration the simplemindedand credulous ascribing the exaltation of peterchen to a generous warmthin their happiness and interests while the more wary and observant wereapt to impute the musical excess to a previous excess of anothercharacter in which the wines of the neighboring ctes were fairlyentitled to come in for a full share of the merit</s>  those who were nearestthe bailiff were secretly much divertedwith his awkward attempts atgraciousness which one fair and witty vaudoise likened to the antics ofone of the celebrated animals that are still fostered in the city whichruled so much of switzerland and from whom indeed the town and cantonare both vulgarly supposed to have derived their common name for whilethe authority of berne weighed so imperiously and heavily on itssubsidiary countries as is usual in such cases the people of the latterwere much addicted to taking an impotent revenge by whispering thepleasantest sarcasms they could invent against their masters</s> notwithstanding this and many more criticisms on his performance thebailiff enacted his part in the representation to his own entiresatisfaction and he resumed his seat with a consciousness of having atleast merited the applause of the people for having entered with so muchspirit into their games and with the hope that this act of grace might bethe means of causing them to forget some fifty or a hundred of his otheracts which certainly had not possessed the same melodious andcompanionable features</s> after this achievement the bailiff was reasonably quiet until bacchus andhis train again entered the square</s>  at the appearance of the laughingurchin who bestrode the cask he resumed his dissertations with aconfidence that all are apt to feel who are about to treat on a subjectwith which they have had occasion to be familiar</s> this is the god of good liquor said peterchen always speaking to anywho would listen although by an instinct of respect he chiefly preferredfavoring the signor grimaldi with his remarks as may plainly be seen byhis seat and these are dancing attendants to show that wine gladdens theheartyonder is the press at work extracting the

accompaniment during the time thatthe followers of bacchus were going through with their songs and pageantsand when they disappeared it gained a louder key like the rolling riverthat murmuring flows

separated from the world and amid thatmagnificent solitude where the passions and the vulgar interests of lifesank into corresponding insignificance as the majesty of god became hourlymore visible the baron had been gradually won upon to consent</s>  love forhis child aided by the fine moral and personal qualities of the young manhimself which here stood out in strong relief like one of the sternpiles of those alps that now appeared to his eyes so much superior intheir eternal beds to all the vineclad hills and teeming valleys of thelower world had been the immediate and efficient agents in producing thisdecision</s>  it is not pretended that the bernese made an easy conquest overhis prejudices which was in truth no other than a conquest over himselfhe being morally considered little other than a collection of the narrowopinions and exclusive doctrines which it was then the fashion to believenecessary to high civilization</s>  on the contrary the struggle had beensevere nor is it probable that the gentle blandishments of adelheid theeloquent but silent appeals to his reason that were constantly made bysigismund in his deportment or the arguments of his old comrade thesignor grimaldi who with a philosophy that is more often made apparentin our friendships than in our own practice dilated copiously on thewisdom of sacrificing a few worthless and antiquated opinions to thehappiness of an only child would have prevailed had the baron been in asituation less abstracted from the ordinary circumstances of his rank andhabits than that in which he had been so accidentally thrown</s>  the piousclavier too who had obtained some claims to the confidence of the guestsof the convent by his services and by the risks he had run in theircompany came to swell the number of sigismunds friends</s>  of humble originhimself and attached to the young man not only by his general merits butby his conduct on the lake he neglected no good occasion to work uponmelchiors mind

perishablenature of human hopes and on the frailty of human opinions</s>  he dwelt withpious fervor on the usefulness of recalling the thoughts from the turmoilof daily and contracted interests to a wider view of the truths ofexistence</s>  pointing to the wild scene around them he likened the confusedmasses of the mountains their sterility and their ruthless tempests tothe world with its want of happy fruits its disorders and its violence</s> then directing the attention of his companion to the azure vault abovethem which seen at that elevation and in that pure atmosphereresembled a benign

and imposing calm of that tranquil and inimitable void</s>  he drewhis moral in favor of a measured enjoyment of our advantages here as wellas of rendering love and justice to all who merited our esteem and to thedisadvantage of those iron prejudices which confine the best sentiments inthe fetters of opinions founded in the ordinances and provisions of theviolent and selfish</s> it was after one of these interesting dialogues that melchior dewillading his heart softened and his soul touched with the hopes ofheaven listened with a more indulgent ear to the firm declaration ofadelheid that unless she became the wife of sigismund her selfrespectno less than her affections must compel her to pass her life unmarried</s> we shall not say that the maiden herself philosophized on premises assublime as those of the good monk for with her the warm impulses of theheart lay at the bottom of her resolution but even she had therespectable support of reason to sustain her cause</s>  the baron had thatinnate desire to perpetuate his own existence in that of his descendantswhich appears to be a property of nature</s>  alarmed at a declaration whichthreatened annihilation to his line while at the same time he was morethan usually under the influence of his better feelings he promised thatif the charge of murder could be removed from balthazar he would nolonger oppose the union</s>  we should be giving the reader an opinion alittle too favorable of the herr von willading were we to say that hedid not repent having made this promise soon after it was uttered</s>  he wasin a state of mind that resembled the vanes of his own towers whichchanged their direction with every fresh current of air but he was byfar too honorable to think seriously of violating a faith that he hadonce fairly plighted</s>  he had moments of unpleasant misgivings as to thewisdom and propriety of his promise but they were of that species ofregret which is known to attend an unavoidable evil</s>  if he had anyexpectations of being released from his pledge they were bottomed oncertain vague impressions that balthazar would be found guilty though theconstant and earnest asseverations of sigismund in favor of his father hadgreatly succeeded in shaking his faith on this point</s>  adelheid hadstronger hopes than either the fears of the young man himself preventinghim from fully participating in her confidence while her father sharedher expectations on that tormenting principle which causes us to dreadthe worst</s>  when therefore the jewelry of jacques colis was found in thepossession of maso and balthazar was unanimously acquitted not only fromthis circumstance which went so conclusively to criminate another butfrom the want of any other evidence against him than the fact of his beingfound in the bonehouse instead of the refuge an accident that might wellhave happened to any other traveller in the storm the baron resolutelyprepared himself to redeem his pledge</s>  it is scarcely necessary to add howmuch this honorable sentiment was strengthened by the unexpecteddeclaration of the headsman concerning the birth of sigismund</s> notwithstanding the asseveration of maso that the whole was an inventionconceived to fervor the son of balthazar it was supported by proofs sosubstantial and palpable to say nothing of the natural and veraciousmanner in which the tale was related as to create a strong probabilityin the minds of the witnesses that it might be true</s>  although it remainedto be discovered who were the real parents of sigismund few now believedthat he owed his existence to the headsman</s> a short summary of the facts may aid the reader in better understandingthe circumstances on which so much dnouement depends</s> it has been revealed in the course of the narrative that the signorgrimaldi had wedded a lady younger than himself whose affections werealready in the possession of one that in moral qualities was unworthy ofher love but who in

the abduction of the child</s>  years had passed when the signor grimaldiwas first apprized of the existence of the latter</s>  he had received thisimportant information at a moment when the authorities of genoa were mostactive in pursuing those who had long and desperately trifled with thelaws and the avowed motive for the revelation was an appeal to hisnatural affection in behalf of a son who was likely to become the victimof his practices</s>  the recovery of a child under such circumstances was ablow severer than his loss and it will readily be supposed that the truthof the pretension of maso who then went by the name of bartolomeocontini was admitted with the greatest caution</s>  reference had been madeby the friends of the smuggler to a dying monk whose character was abovesuspicion and who corroborated with his latest breath the statement ofmaso by affirming before god and the saints that he knew him so far asman could know a fact like this to be the son of the signer grimaldithis grave testimony given under circumstances of such solemnity andsupported by the production of important papers that had been stolen withthe child removed the suspicions of the doge</s>  he secretly interposed hisinterest to save the criminal though after a fruitless attempt to effecta reformation of his habits by means of confidential agents he had neverconsented to see him</s> such then was the nature of the conflicting statements</s>  while hope and thepure delight of finding himself the father of a son like sigismund causedthe aged prince to cling to the claims of
