fiddle all day long if he likes saidmrs</s>  bhaer to herself as she saw the eager happy expression on hisface when tommy talked of the band</s> so after supper when the lads flocked into the

clatter in the room but as if deaf to any sounds butthose he made nat played softly to himself forgetting every thing inhis delight</s>  it was only a simple negro melody such as streetmusiciansplay but it caught the ears of the boys at once and silenced themtill they stood listening with surprise and pleasure</s>  gradually they gotnearer and nearer and mr</s>  bhaer came up to watch the boy for

you do that first rate cried tommy who considered nat hisprotege</s> you shall be the first fiddle in my band added franz with anapproving smile</s> mrs</s>  bhaer whispered to her husbandteddy is right theres something in the child</s>  and mr</s>  bhaer noddedhis head emphatically as he clapped nat on the shoulder sayingheartilyyou play well my son</s>  come now and play something which we can sing</s> it was the proudest happiest minute of the poor boys life when he wasled to the place of honor by the piano and the lads gathered roundnever heeding his poor clothes but eying him respectfully and waitingeagerly to hear him play again</s> they chose a song he knew and after one or two false starts they gotgoing and violin flute and piano led a chorus of boyish voices thatmade the old roof ring again</s>  it was too much for nat more feeble thanhe knew and as the final shout died away his face began to work hedropped the fiddle and turning to the wall sobbed like a little child</s> my dear what is it</s>  asked mrs</s>  bhaer who had been singing with allher might and trying to keep little rob from beating time with hisboots</s> you are all so kind and its so beautiful i cant help it sobbed natcoughing till he was breathless</s> come with me dear you must go to bed and rest you are worn out andthis is too noisy a place for you whispered mrs</s>  bhaer and took himaway to her own parlor where she let him cry himself quiet</s> then she won him to tell her all his troubles and listened to thelittle story with tears in her own eyes though it was not a new one

her cap forrays</s> this is nursey hummel and she will give you a nice bath and cut yourhair and make you all comfy as rob says</s>  thats the bathroom inthere and on saturday nights we scrub all the little lads first andpack them away in bed before the big ones get through singing</s>  now thenrob in with you</s> as she talked mrs</s>  bhaer had whipped off robs clothes and popped himinto a long bathtub in the little room opening into the nursery</s> there were two tubs besides footbaths basins douchepipes and allmanner of contrivances for cleanliness</s>  nat was soon luxuriating in theother bath and while simmering there he watched the performances ofthe two women who scrubbed clean nightgowned and bundled into bedfour or five small boys who of course cut up all sorts of capersduring the operation and kept every one in a gale of merriment tillthey were extinguished in their beds</s> by the time nat was washed and done up in a blanket by the fire whilenursey cut his hair a new detachment of boys arrived and were shut intothe bathroom where they made as much splashing and noise as a schoolof young whales at play</s> nat had better sleep here so that if his cough troubles him in thenight you can see that he takes a good draught of flaxseed tea saidmrs</s>  bhaer who was flying about like a distracted hen with a largebrood of lively ducklings</s> nursey approved the plan finished nat off with a flannel nightgown adrink of something warm and sweet and then tucked him into one of thethree little beds standing in the room where he lay looking like acontented mummy and feeling that nothing more in the way of luxurycould be offered him</s>  cleanliness in itself was a new and delightfulsensation flannel gowns were unknown comforts in his world sips ofgood stuff

directions hurled by white goblinswho came rioting out of their beds</s>  the battle raged in several roomsall down the upper hall and even surged at intervals into the nurserywhen some hardpressed warrior took refuge there</s>  no one seemed tomind this explosion in the least no one forbade it or even lookedsurprised</s>  nursey went on hanging up towels and mrs</s>  bhaer laid outclean clothes as calmly as if the most perfect order reigned</s>  nayshe even chased one daring boy out of the room and fired after him thepillow he had slyly thrown at her</s> wont they hurt em</s>  asked nat who

tried it and it worked well</s>  if they dontkeep their word no frolic if they do i just turn the glasses roundput the lamps in safe places and let them rampage as much as theylike</s> its a beautiful plan said nat feeling that he should like to joinin the fray but not venturing to propose it the first night</s>  so he layenjoying the spectacle which certainly was a lively one</s> tommy bangs led the assailing party and demi defended his own room witha dogged courage fine to see collecting pillows behind him as fast asthey were thrown till the besiegers were out of ammunition when theywould

with his face toward thepicture as if he had already learned to love the good man who lovedlittle children and was a faithful friend to the poor</s>  the boys facewas very placid and as she looked at it she felt that if a single dayof care and kindness had done so much a year of patient cultivationwould surely bring a grateful harvest from this neglected garden whichwas already sown with the best

the right feeling among them and nathad few hindrances to struggle against for every one was glad to givehim a boost up the ladder of learning</s> till he was stronger much study was not good for him however and mrs</s> jo found various amusements in the house for him while others were attheir books</s>  but his garden was his best medicine and he worked awaylike a beaver preparing his little farm sowing his beans watchingeagerly to see them grow and rejoicing over each green leaf and slenderstock that shot up and flourished in the warm spring weather</s>  neverwas a garden more faithfully hoed mr</s>  bhaer really feared that nothingwould find time to grow nat kept up such a stirring of the soil so hegave him easy jobs in the flower garden or among the strawberries wherehe worked and hummed

hearts</s>  feeling this thebhaers gathered up all the crumbs they could find to feed their flock ofhungry sparrows for they were not rich except in charity</s>  many ofmrs</s>  jos friends who had nurseries sent her they toys of which theirchildren so soon tired and in mending these nat found an employmentthat just suited him</s>  he was very neat and skillful with those slenderfingers of his and passed many a rainy afternoon with his gumbottlepaintbox and knife repairing furniture animals and games whiledaisy was dressmaker to the dilapidated dolls</s>  as fast as the toys weremended they were put carefully away in a certain drawer which wasto furnish forth a christmastree for all the poor children of theneighborhood that being the way the plumfield boys celebrated thebirthday of him who loved the poor and blessed the little ones</s> demi was never tired of reading and explaining his favorite books andmany a pleasant hour did they spend in the old willow revelling overrobinson crusoe arabian nights edgeworths tales and the otherdear immortal stories that will delight children for centuries to come</s> this opened a new world to nat and his eagerness to see what came nextin the story helped him on till he could read as well as anybody andfelt so rich and proud with his new accomplishment that there wasdanger of his being as much of a bookworm as demi</s> another helpful thing happened in a most unexpected and agreeablemanner</s>  several of the boys were in business as they called it formost of them were poor and knowing that they would have their own wayto make by

aturninglathe was set up for him in which he turned all sorts of usefulor pretty things and sold them while demi constructed watermillswhirligigs and unknown machines of an intricate and useless

readilygo and welcome</s>  it is an easy and a pleasant way to work and i amglad it is offered you</s> nat went and did so well that when he came home he had two dollars inhis pocket which he displayed with intense satisfaction as he told howmuch he had enjoyed the afternoon how kind the young people were andhow they had praised his dance music and promised to have him again</s> it is so much nicer than fiddling in the street for then i got noneof the money and now i have it all and a good time besides</s>  im inbusiness now as well as tommy and jack and i like it ever so muchsaid nat proudly patting the old pocketbook and feeling like amillionaire already</s> he was in business truly for picnics were plenty as summer openedand nats skill was in great demand</s>  he was always at liberty to go iflessons were not neglected and if the picnickers were respectable youngpeople</s>  for mr</s>  bhaer explained to him that a good plain education isnecessary for everyone and that no amount of money should hire him togo where he might be tempted to do wrong</s>  nat quite agreed to this andit was a pleasant sight to see the innocenthearted lad go driving awayin the gay wagons that stopped at the gate for him or to hear him comefiddling home tired but happy with his wellearned money in one pocketand some goodies from the feast for daisy or little ted whom he neverforgot</s> im going to save up till i get enough to buy a violin for myself andthen i can earn my own living cant i</s>  he used to say as he broughthis dollars to mr</s>  bhaer to keep</s> i hope so nat but we

you play in public</s> with much congenial work encouragement and hope nat found lifegetting easier and happier every day and made such progress in hismusic lessons that his teacher forgave his slowness in some otherthings knowing very well that where the heart is the mind works best</s> the only punishment the boy ever needed for neglect of more importantlessons was to hang up the fiddle and the bow for a day</s>  the fear oflosing his bosom friend entirely made him go at his books with a willand having proved that he could master the lessons what was the use ofsaying i cant</s> daisy had a great love of music and a great reverence for any one whocould make it and she was often found sitting on the stairs outsidenats door while he was practising</s>  this pleased him very much and heplayed his best for that one quiet little listener for she never wouldcome in but preferred to sit sewing her gay patchwork or tending oneof her many dolls with an expression of dreamy pleasure on her facethat made aunt jo say with tears in her eyes so like my beth andgo softly by lest even her familiar presence mar the childs sweetsatisfaction</s> nat was very fond of mrs</s>  bhaer but found something even moreattractive in the good professor who took fatherly care of the shyfeeble boy who had barely escaped with his life from the rough sea onwhich his little boat had been tossing rudderless for twelve years</s>  somegood angel must have been watching over him for though his body hadsuffered his soul seemed to have taken little harm and came ashore asinnocent as a shipwrecked

nats gave the bhaers much anxiety although they saw howit had been strengthened by fear and ignorance</s>  i regret to say thatnat sometimes told lies</s>  not very black ones seldom getting deeper

cannot be too careful watch your tongue and eyes and hands forit is easy to tell and look and act untruth said mr</s>  bhaer in oneof the talks he had with nat about his chief temptation</s> i know it and i dont mean to but its so much easier to get alongif you aint very fussy about being exactly true</s>  i used to tell embecause i was afraid of father and nicolo and now i do sometimesbecause the

when she laydying far away in nuremberg she prayed that little fritz might love godand tell the truth</s> i never had any grandmothers but if you think it will cure me illlet you snip my tongue said nat heroically for he dreaded pain yetdid wish to stop fibbing</s> mr</s>  bhaer smiled but shook his head</s> i have a better way than that i tried it once before and it workedwell</s>  see now when you tell a lie i will not punish you but you shallpunish me</s> how</s>  asked nat startled at the idea</s> you shall ferule me in the good oldfashioned way i seldom do itmyself but it may make you remember better to give me pain than to feelit yourself</s> strike you</s>  oh i couldnt</s>  cried nat</s> then mind that tripping tongue of thine</s>  i have no wish to be hurt buti would gladly bear much pain to cure this fault</s> this suggestion made such an impression on nat that for a long time heset a watch upon his lips and was desperately accurate for mr</s>  bhaerjudged rightly that love of him would be more powerful with nat thatfear for himself</s>  but alas</s>  one sad day nat was off his guard and whenpeppery emil threatened to thrash him if it was he who had run over hisgarden and broken down his best hills of corn nat declared he didntand then was ashamed to own up that he did do it when jack was chasinghim the night before</s> he thought no one would find it out

bhaer had just set down on the straw settee to enjoyhis frolic with teddy but when he heard tommy and saw nat turn scarletand look at him with a frightened face he put the little boy downsaying go to

 hes going to come down heavy on nat this time</s>  wish i hadnttold thought goodnatured tommy for to be feruled was the deepestdisgrace at this school</s> you remember what i told you last time</s>  said mr</s>  bhaer sorrowfullynot angrily</s> yes but please dont make me i cant bear it cried nat backingup against the door with both hands behind him and a face full ofdistress</s> why dont he up and take it like a man</s>  i would thought tommy thoughhis heart beat fast at the sight</s> i shall keep my word and you must remember to tell the truth</s>  obey menat take this and give me six good strokes</s> tommy was so staggered by this last speech that he nearly tumbled downthe bank but saved himself and hung onto the window ledge staring inwith eyes as round as the stuffed owls on the chimneypiece</s> nat took the rule for when mr</s>  bhaer spoke in that tone everyone obeyedhim and looking as scared and guilty as if about to stab his masterhe gave two feeble blows on the broad hand held out to him</s>  thenhe stopped and looked up halfblind with tears but mr</s>  bhaer saidsteadilygo on and strike harder</s> as if seeing that it must be done and eager to have the hard task soonover nat drew his sleeve across his eyes and gave two more quick hardstrokes that reddened the hand yet hurt the giver more</s> isnt that enough</s>  he asked in a breathless sort of tone</s> two more was all the answer and he gave them hardly seeing wherethey fell then threw the rule all across the room and hugging the kindhand in both his own laid his face down on it sobbing out in a

said ned collaring emil in a fit of righteouswrath</s> it was ever so long ago</s>  id rather have my head cut off than do itnow and emil mildly laid ned on his back instead of cuffing him as hewould

perhaps</s>  but when id hit uncle one good crackeverything he had ever done for me came into my head all at oncesomehow and i couldnt go on</s>  no sir</s>  if hed laid me down and walkedon me i wouldnt have minded i felt so mean and emil gave himself agood thump in the chest to express his sense of remorse for the past</s> nats crying like anything and feels no end sorry so dont lets saya

them go but no one followed for boys have a great dealmore delicacy than they get credit for and the lads instinctively feltthat when in disgrace gentle little daisy was their most congenialfriend</s> the walk did nat good and he came home quieter than usual but lookingcheerful again and hung all over with daisychains made by his littleplaymate while he lay on the grass and told her stories</s> no one said a word about the scene of the morning but its effect wasall the more lasting for that reason perhaps</s>  nat tried his very bestand found much help not only from the earnest little prayers

 cried daisy flying into mrs</s>  bhaers room</s> its all ready come on and tucking ted under one arm and herworkbasket under the other aunt jo promptly led the way upstairs</s> i dont see anything

joyful oh</s>  and thenstood gazing with delight at what do you think</s> a wide seat ran round the three sides of the window on one side hungand stood all sorts of little pots and pans gridirons and

ofdelight its a perfectly splendid play</s> old asia enjoyed the joke as much as daisy and laughed jollily as thelittle girl came flying into the room with her cap all on one side thelids of her

squash a little patof butter and a roll into the basket telling sally to be on the watchfor the butchers boy because he sometimes played tricks</s> who is he</s>  and daisy hoped it would be demi</s> youll see was all asia would say and sally went off in greatspirits singing a verse from dear mary howitts sweet story in rhyme  away went little mabel  with the wheaten cake so fine  the newmade pot of butter  and the little flask of wine</s> put everything but the apple into the storecloset for the presentsaid mrs</s>  jo when the cook got home</s> there was a cupboard under the middle shelf and on opening the doorfresh delights appeared</s>  one half was evidently the cellar for woodcoal and kindlings were piled there</s>  the other half was full of littlejars boxes and all sorts of droll contrivances for holding smallquantities of flour meal sugar salt and other household stores</s>  apot of jam was there a little tin box of gingerbread a cologne bottlefull of currant wine and a tiny canister of tea</s>  but the crowning charmwas two dolls pans of new milk with cream actually rising on it anda wee skimmer all ready to skim it with</s>  daisy clasped her hands atthis delicious spectacle and wanted to skim it immediately</s>  but aunt josaidnot yet you will want the cream to eat on your apple pie at dinnerand must not disturb it till then</s> am i going to have pie</s>  cried daisy hardly believing that such blisscould be in store for her</s> yes if your oven does well we will have two pies one apple and onestrawberry said mrs</s>  jo who was nearly as much interested in the newplay as daisy herself</s> oh what next</s>  asked sally all impatience to begin</s> shut the lower draught of the stove so that the oven may heat</s> then wash your hands and get out the flour sugar salt butter andcinnamon</s>  see if the pieboard is clean and pare your apple ready toput in</s> daisy got things together with as little noise and spilling as could beexpected from so young a cook</s> i really dont know how to measure for such tiny pies i must guessat it and if these dont succeed we must try again said mrs</s>  jolooking rather perplexed and very much amused with the small concernbefore her</s>  take that little pan full of flour put in a pinch of saltand then rub in as much butter as will go on that plate</s>  always rememberto put your dry things together first and then the wet</s>  it mixes betterso</s> i know how i saw asia do it</s>  dont i butter the pie plates too</s>  shedid the first thing said daisy whisking the flour about at a greatrate</s> quite right</s>  i do believe you have a gift for cooking you take to itso cleverly said aunt jo approvingly</s>  now a dash of cold waterjust enough to wet it then scatter some flour on the board work ina little and roll the paste out yes thats the way</s>  now put dabs ofbutter all over it and roll it out again</s>  we wont have our pastry veryrich or the dolls will get dyspeptic</s> daisy laughed at the idea and scattered the dabs with a liberal hand</s> then she rolled and rolled with her delightful little pin and havinggot her paste ready proceeded to cover the plates with it</s>  next theapple was sliced in sugar and cinnamon lavishly sprinkled over it andthen the top crust put on with breathless care</s> i always wanted to cut them round and asia never would let me</s>  hownice it is to do it all my ownty donty self</s>  said daisy as the littleknife went clipping round the dolls plate poised on her hand</s> all cooks even the best meet with mishaps sometimes and sallys firstone occurred then for the knife went so fast that the plate slippedturned a somersault in the air and landed the dear little pie upsidedown on the floor</s>  sally screamed mrs</s>  jo laughed teddy scrambled toget it and for a moment confusion reigned in the new kitchen</s> it didnt spill or break because i pinched the edges together so hardit isnt hurt a bit so ill prick holes in it and then it will beready said sally picking up the capsized treasure and putting it intoshape with a childlike disregard of the dust it had gathered in itsfall</s> my new cook has a good temper i see and that is such a comfort saidmrs</s>  jo</s>  now open the jar of strawberry jam fill the uncovered pieand put some strips of paste over the top as asia does</s> ill make a d in the middle and have zigzags all round that will beso interesting when i come to eat it said sally loading the pie withquirls and flourishes that would have driven a real pastry cook wild</s> now i put them in</s>  she exclaimed when the last grimy knob had beencarefully planted in the red field of jam and with an air of triumphshe shut them into the little oven</s> clear up your things a good cook never lets her utensils collect</s>  thenpare your squash and potatoes</s> there is only one potato giggled sally</s> cut it in four pieces so it will go into the little kettle and putthe bits into cold water till it is time to cook them</s> do i soak the squash too</s> no indeed</s>  just pare it and cut it up and put in into the steamerover the pot</s>  it is drier so though it takes longer to cook</s> here a scratching at the door caused sally to run and open it when kitappeared with a covered basket in his mouth</s> heres the butcher boy</s>  cried daisy much tickled at the idea as sherelieved him of his load whereat he licked his lips and began to begevidently thinking that it was his own dinner for he often carried itto his master in that way</s>  being undeceived he departed in great wrathand barked all the way downstairs to ease his wounded feelings</s> in the basket were two bits of steak dolls pounds a baked pear asmall cake and paper with them on which asia had

keep him quiet tilldinner was ready and returned to her housekeeping</s> put on your vegetables set the table and then have some coalskindling ready for the steak</s> what a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little potto peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer to whiskopen the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on andat last when the coals were red and glowing to put two real steaks ona fingerlong gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork</s>  the potatoeswere done first and no wonder for they had boiled frantically all thewhile</s>  the were pounded up with a little pestle had much butter and nosalt put in cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment then itwas made into a mound in a gay red dish smoothed over with a knifedipped in milk and put in the oven to brown</s> so absorbed in these last performances had sally been that she forgother pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato then a wailarose for alas</s>  alas</s>  the little pies were burnt black</s> oh my pies</s>  my darling pies</s>  they are all spoilt</s>  cried poor sallywringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work</s> the tart was especially pathetic for the quirls and zigzags stuck up inall directions from the blackened jelly like the walls and chimney of ahouse after a fire</s> dear dear i forgot to remind you to take them out its just myluck said aunt jo remorsefully</s>  dont cry darling it was my faultwell try again after dinner she added as a great tear dropped fromsallys eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart</s> more would have followed if the steak had not blazed up just thenand so occupied the attention of cook that she quickly forgot the lostpastry</s> put the meatdish and your own plates down to warm while you mash thesquash with butter salt and a little pepper on the top said mrs</s>  jodevoutly hoping that the dinner would meet with no further disasters</s> the cunning pepperpot soothed sallys feelings and she dished up hersquash in fine style</s>  the dinner was safely put upon the table the sixdolls were seated three on a side teddy took the bottom and sally thetop</s>  when all were settled it was a most imposing spectacle for onedoll was in full ball costume another in her nightgown jerry theworsted boy wore his red winter suit

and did not find a single fault</s>  daisybeamed upon her company like the weary warm but hospitable hostess sooften to be seen at larger tables than this and did the honors with anair of innocent satisfaction which we do not often see elsewhere</s> the steak was so tough that the little carvingknife would not cut itthe potato did not go round and the squash was very lumpy but theguests appeared politely unconscious of these trifles and the masterand mistress of the house cleared the table with appetites that anyonemight envy them</s>  the joy of skimming a jugfull of cream mitigated

and ate the leavings all round</s> you can cook things every day after lessons but i prefer that youshould eat your dishes at your regular meals and only have a bit ofgingerbread for lunch</s>  today

invited her to partake</s> do let me make flapjacks for demi he loves them so and its such funto turn them and put sugar in between cried daisy tenderly wiping ayellow stain off annabellas broken nose for bella had refused to eatsquash when it was pressed upon her as good for lumatism a complaintwhich it is no wonder she suffered from considering the lightness ofher attire</s> but if you give demi goodies all the others will expect some also andthen you will have your hands full</s> couldnt i have demi come up to tea alone just this one time</s>  and afterthat i could cook things for the others

daisy proudly showed her kitchen and rashly promised uncle fritz asmany flapjacks as he could eat</s>  she was just telling about the newrewards when the boys headed by demi burst into the room snuffing theair like a pack of hungry hounds for school was out dinner was notready and the fragrance of daisys steak led them straight to the spot</s> a prouder little damsel was never seen than sally as she displayed hertreasures and told the lads what was in store for them</s>  several ratherscoffed at the idea of her cooking anything fit to eat but stuffysheart was won at once</s>  nat and demi had firm faith in her skill and theothers said they would wait and see</s>  all admired the kitchen howeverand examined the stove with deep interest</s>  demi offered to buythe boiler on the spot to be used in a steamengine which he wasconstructing and ned declared that the best and biggest saucepan wasjust the thing to melt his lead in when he ran bullets hatchets andsuch trifles</s> daisy looked so alarmed at these proposals that mrs</s>  jo then andthere made and proclaimed a law that no boy should touch use oreven approach the sacred stove without a special permit from theowner thereof</s>  this increased its value immensely in the eyes of thegentlemen especially as any infringement of the law would be punishedby forfeiture of all right to partake of the delicacies promised to thevirtuous</s> at this point the bell rang and the entire population went down todinner which meal was enlivened by each of the boys giving daisy alist of things he would like to have cooked for him as fast as heearned them</s>  daisy whose faith in her stove was unlimited promisedeverything if aunt jo would tell her how to make them</s>  this suggestionrather alarmed mrs</s>  jo for some of the dishes were quite beyond herskill weddingcake for instance bullseye candy and cabbage soupwith herrings and cherries in it which mr</s>  bhaer proposed as hisfavorite and immediately reduced his wife to despair for germancookery was beyond her</s> daisy wanted to begin again the minute dinner was done but she was onlyallowed to clear up fill the kettle ready for tea and wash out herapron which looked as if she had a christmas feast</s>  she was then sentout to play till five oclock for uncle fritz said that too much studyeven at cooking stoves was bad for little minds and bodies and aunt joknew by long experience how soon new toys lose their charm if they arenot prudently used</s> everyone was very kind to daisy that afternoon</s>  tommy promised her thefirst fruits of his garden though the only visible crop just then waspigweed nat offered to supply her with wood free of charge stuffyquite worshipped her ned immediately fell to work on a littlerefrigerator for her kitchen and demi with a punctuality beautifulto see in one so young escorted her to the nursery just as the clockstruck five</s>  it was not time for the party to begin but he begged sohard to come in and help that he was allowed privileges few visitorsenjoy for he kindled the fire ran errands and watched the progressof his supper with intense interest</s>  mrs</s>  jo directed the affair as shecame and went being very busy putting up clean curtains all over thehouse</s> ask asia for a cup of sour cream then your cakes will be light withoutmuch soda which i dont like was the first order</s> demi tore downstairs and returned with the cream also a puckeredupface for he had tasted it on his way and found it so sour that hepredicted the cakes would be uneatable</s>  mrs</s>  jo took this occasion todeliver a short lecture from the stepladder on the chemical propertiesof soda to which daisy did not listen but demi did and understood itas he proved by the brief but comprehensive replyyes i see soda turns sour things sweet and the fizzling up makesthem light</s>  lets see you do it daisy</s> fill that bowl nearly full of flour and add a little salt to itcontinued mrs</s>  jo</s> oh dear everything has to have salt in it seems to me said sallywho was tired of opening the pillbox in which it was kept</s> salt is like goodhumor and nearly every thing is better for a pinchof it posy and uncle fritz stopped as he passed hammer in hand todrive up two or three nails for sallys little pans to hang on</s> you are not invited to tea but ill give you some cakes and i wontbe cross said daisy putting up her floury little face to thank himwith a kiss</s> fritz you must not interrupt my cooking class or ill come in andmoralize when you are teaching latin</s>  how would you like that</s>  saidmrs</s>  jo throwing a great chintz curtain down on his head</s> very much try it and see and the amiable father bhaer went singingand tapping about the house like a mammoth woodpecker</s> put the soda into the cream and when it fizzles as demi says stirit into the flour and beat it up as hard as ever you can</s>  have yourgriddle hot butter it well and then fry away till i come back andaunt jo vanished also</s> such a clatter as the little spoon made and such a beating as thebatter got it quite foamed i assure you and when daisy poured someon to the griddle it rose like magic into a puffy flapjack that madedemis mouth water</s>  to be sure the first one stuck and scorchedbecause she forgot the butter but after that first failure all wentwell and six capital little cakes were safely landed in a dish</s> i think i like maplesyrup better than sugar said demi from hisarmchair where he had settled himself after setting the table in a newand peculiar manner</s> then go and ask asia for some answered daisy going into thebathroom to wash her hands</s> while the nursery was empty something dreadful happened</s>  you see kithad been feeling hurt all day because he had carried meat safely and yetgot none to pay him</s>  he was not a bad dog but he had his little faultslike the rest of us and could not always resist temptation</s>  happeningto stroll into the nursery at that moment he smelt the cakes saw themunguarded on the low table and never stopping to think of consequencesswallowed all six at one mouthful</s>  i am glad to say that they were veryhot and burned him so badly that he could not repress a surprised yelp</s> daisy heard it ran in saw the empty dish also the end of a yellowtail disappearing under the bed</s>  without a word she seized that tailpulled out the thief and shook him till his ears flapped wildly thenbundled him downstairs to the shed where he spent a lonely evening inthe coalbin</s> cheered by the sympathy which demi gave her daisy made another bowlfulof batter and fried a dozen cakes which were even better than theothers</s>  indeed uncle fritz after eating two sent up word that he hadnever tasted any so nice and every boy at the table below envied demiat the flapjack party above</s> it was a truly delightful supper for the little teapot lid only felloff three times and the milk jug upset but once the cakes floated insyrup and the toast had a delicious beefsteak flavor owing to cooksusing the gridiron to make it on</s>  demi forgot philosophy and stuffedlike any carnal boy while daisy planned sumptuous banquets and thedolls looked on smiling affably</s> well dearies have you had a good time</s>  asked mrs</s>  jo coming up withteddy on her shoulder</s> a very good time</s>  i shall come again soon answered demi withemphasis</s> im afraid you have eaten too much by the look of that table</s> no i havent i only ate fifteen cakes and they were very littleones protested demi who had kept his sister busy

startled bythe coolness of the proposition</s> why i thought you liked to have poor boys come and live with youand be kind to em as you were to me said nat looking surprised andalarmed</s> so i do but i like to know something about them first</s>  i have tochoose them because there are so many</s>  i have not room for all</s>  i wishi had</s> i told him to come because i thought youd like it but if

hisshoulder and say in her kindest tonebring in your friend nat i think we must find room for him withoutgiving him your place</s> nat joyfully ran off and soon returned followed by a mostunprepossessing boy who slouched in and stood looking about him with ahalf bold half sullen look which made mrs</s>  bhaer say to herself afterone glancea bad specimen i am afraid</s> this is dan said nat presenting him as if sure of his welcome</s> nat tells me you would like to come and stay with us began mrs</s>  join a friendly tone</s> yes was the gruff reply</s> have you no friends to

fixed his big black eyes on herwith a hard suspicious expression sorrowfully unboyish</s> come on nat he said and slouched out again</s> thank you maam added nat as he followed him feeling without quiteunderstanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to hisungracious friend</s> the fellows are having a circus out in the barn dont you want to comeand see it</s>  he asked as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn</s> are they big fellows</s>  said dan</s> no the big ones are gone fishing</s> fire away then said dan</s> nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set who weredisporting themselves among the halfempty lofts</s>  a large circle wasmarked out with hay on the wide floor and in the middle stood demi witha long whip while tommy mounted on the muchenduring toby prancedabout the circle playing being a monkey</s> you must pay a pin apiece or you cant see the show said stuffywho stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band consisting of apocketcomb blown upon by ned and a toy drum beaten spasmodically byrob</s> hes company so ill pay for both said nat handsomely as he stucktwo crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as moneybox</s> with a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boardsand the performance went on</s>  after the monkey act ned gave them a finespecimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair and running upand down ladders sailor fashion</s>  then demi danced a jig with a gravitybeautiful to behold</s>  nat was called upon to wrestle with stuffy andspeedily laid that stout youth upon the ground</s>  after this tommyproudly advanced to turn a somersault an accomplishment which he hadacquired by painful perseverance practising in private till every jointof his little frame was black and blue</s>  his feats were received withgreat applause and he was about to retire flushed with pride and arush of blood to the head when a scornful voice in the audience washeard to sayho</s>  that aint any thing</s> say that again will you</s>  and tommy bristled up like an angryturkeycock</s> do you want to fight</s>  said dan promptly descending from the barreland doubling up his fists in a businesslike manner</s> no i dont and the candid thomas retired a step rather taken abackby the proposition</s> fighting isnt allowed</s>  cried the others much excited</s> youre a nice lot sneered dan</s> come if you dont behave you shant stay said nat firing up atthat insult to his friends</s> id like to see him do better than i did thats all observed tommywith a swagger</s> clear the way then and without the slightest preparation dan turnedthree somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet</s> you cant beat that tom you always hit your head and tumble flatsaid nat pleased at his friends success</s> before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three moresomersaults backwards and a short promenade on the hands head downfeet up</s>  this brought down the house and tommy joined in the admiringcries which greeted the accomplished gymnast as he righted himself andlooked at them with an air of calm superiority</s> do you think i could learn to do it without its hurting me very much</s> tom meekly asked as he rubbed the elbows which still smarted after thelast attempt</s> what will you give me if ill teach you</s>  said dan</s> my new jackknife its got five blades and only one is broken</s> give it here then</s> tommy handed it over with an affectionate look at its smooth handle</s> dan examined it carefully then putting it into his pocket walked offsaying with a winkkeep it up till you learn thats all</s> a howl of wrath from tommy was followed by a general uproar which didnot subside till dan finding himself in a minority proposed that theyshould play stickknife and whichever won should have the treasure</s> tommy agreed and the game was played in a circle of excited faceswhich all wore an expression of satisfaction when tommy won and securedthe knife in the depth of his safest pocket</s> you come off with me and ill show you round said nat feeling thathe must have a little serious conversation with his friend in private</s> what passed between them no one knew but when they appeared again danwas more respectful to every one though still gruff in his speech andrough in his manner and what else could be expected of the poor ladwho had been knocking about the world all his short life with no one toteach him any better</s> the boys had decided that they did not like him and so they left himto nat who soon felt rather oppressed by the responsibility but tookindhearted to desert him</s> tommy however felt that in spite of the jackknife transactionthere was a bond of sympathy between them and longed to return to theinteresting subject of somersaults</s>  he soon found an opportunity fordan seeing how much he admired him grew more amiable and by the endof the first week was quite intimate with the lively tom</s> mr</s>  bhaer when he heard the story and saw dan shook his head but onlysaid quietlythe experiment may cost us something but we will try it</s> if dan felt any gratitude for his protection he did not show it andtook without thanks all that was give him</s>  he was ignorant but veryquick to learn when he chose had sharp eyes to watch what went on abouthim a saucy tongue rough manners and a temper that was fierce andsullen by turns</s>  he played with all his might and played well at almostall the games</s>  he was silent and gruff before grown people and onlynow and then was thoroughly sociable among the lads</s>  few of them reallyliked him but few could help admiring his courage and strength fornothing daunted him and he knocked tall franz flat on one occasion withan ease that caused all the others to keep at a respectful distance fromhis fists</s>  mr</s>  bhaer watched him silently and did his best to tame thewild boy as they called him but in private the worthy man shook hishead and said soberly i hope the experiment will turn out well but iam a little afraid it may cost too much</s> mrs</s>  bhaer lost her patience with him half a dozen times a day yetnever gave him up and always insisted that there was something goodin the lad after all for he was kinder to animals than to people heliked to rove about in the woods and best of all little ted was fondof him</s>  what the secret was no one could discover but baby took to himat once gabbled and crowed whenever he saw him preferred his strong backto ride on to any of the others and called him my danny out of hisown little head</s>  teddy was the only creature to whom dan showed anaffection and this was only manifested when he thought no oneelse would see it but mothers eyes are quick and motherly heartsinstinctively divine who love their babies</s>  so mrs</s>  jo soon saw and feltthat there was a soft spot in rough dan and bided her time to touch andwin him</s> but an unexpected and decidedly alarming event upset all their plansand banished dan from plumfield</s> tommy nat and demi began by patronizing dan because the otherlads rather slighted him but soon they each felt there was a certainfascination about the bad boy and from looking down upon him they cameto looking up each for a different reason</s>  tommy admired his skill andcourage nat was grateful for past kindness and demi regarded him asa sort of animated story book for when he chose dan could tell hisadventures in a most interesting way</s>  it pleased dan to have the threefavorites like him and he exerted himself to be agreeable which wasthe secret of his success</s> the bhaers were surprised but hoped the lads would have a goodinfluence over dan and waited with some anxiety trusting that no harmwould come of it</s> dan felt they did not quite trust him and never showed them his bestside but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwartingtheir hopes as far as he dared</s> mr</s>  bhaer did not approve of fighting and did not think it a proof ofeither manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another forthe amusement of the rest</s>  all sorts of hardy games and exercises wereencouraged and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbleswithout whining but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of itwere forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play</s> dan laughed at this rule and told such exciting tales of his own valorand the many frays that he had been in that some of the lads were firedwith a desire to have a regular good mill</s> dont tell and ill show you how said dan and getting half a dozenof the lads together behind the barn he gave them a lesson in boxingwhich quite satisfied the ardor of most of them</s>  emil however couldnot submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself for emil waspast fourteen and a plucky fellow so he challenged dan to a fight</s>  danaccepted at once and the others looked on with intense interest</s> what little bird carried the news to headquarters no one ever knewbut in the very hottest of the fray when dan and emil were fightinglike a pair of young bulldogs and the others with fierce excitedfaces were cheering them on mr</s>  bhaer walked into the ring plucked thecombatants apart with a strong hand and said in the voice they seldomheardi cant allow this boys</s>  stop it at once and never let me see itagain</s>  i keep a school for boys not for wild beasts</s>  look at each otherand be ashamed of yourselves</s> you let me go and ill knock him down again shouted dan sparringaway in spite of the grip on his collar</s> come on come on i aint thrashed yet</s>  cried emil who had been downfive times but did not know when he was beaten</s> they are playing be gladdy whatyoucallems like the romans unclefritz called out demi whose eyes were bigger than ever with theexcitement of this new pastime</s> they were a fine set of brutes but we have learned something sincethen i hope and i cannot have you make my barn a colosseum</s>  whoproposed this</s>  asked mr</s>  bhaer</s> dan answered several voices</s> dont you know that it is forbidden</s> yes growled dan sullenly</s> then why break the rule</s> theyll all be mollycoddles if they dont know how to fight</s> have you found emil a mollycoddle</s>  he doesnt look much like oneand mr</s>  bhaer brought the two face to face</s>  dan had a black eye and hisjacket was torn to rags but emils face was covered with blood from acut lip and a bruised nose while a bump on his forehead was already aspurple as a plum</s>  in spite of his wounds however he still glared uponhis foe and evidently panted to renew the fight</s> hed make a firstrater if he was taught said dan unable to withholdthe praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best</s> hell be taught to fence and box by and by and till then i thinkhe will do very well without any lessons in mauling</s>  go and wash yourfaces and remember dan if you break any more of the rules again youwill be sent away</s>  that was the bargain do your part and we will doours</s> the lads went off and after a few more words to the spectators mr</s> bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators</s>  emil wentto bed sick and dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week</s> but the lawless lad had no thought of obeying and soon transgressedagain</s> one saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play tommysaidlets go down to the river and cut a lot of new fishpoles</s> take toby to drag them back and one of us can ride him down proposedstuffy who hated to walk</s> that means you i suppose well hurry up lazybones said dan</s> away they went and having got the poles were about to go home whendemi unluckily said

uneasilytrying not to groan lest any one should hear him for he was a bravelad and did bear pain like a little spartan as mr</s>  bhaer called him</s> mrs</s>  jo had a way of flitting about the house at night to shut thewindows if the wind grew chilly to draw mosquito curtains over teddyor look after tommy who occasionally walked in his sleep</s>  the leastnoise waked her and as she often heard imaginary robbers cats andconflagrations the doors stood open all about so her quick ear caughtthe sound of dans little moans and she was up in a minute</s>  he was justgiving his hot pillow a despairing thump when a light came glimmeringthrough the hall and mrs</s>  jo crept in looking like a droll ghostwith her hair in a great knob on the top of her head and a long graydressinggown

thirsty throat</s> there now sleep your best and dont be frightened if you see meagain for ill slip down by and by and give you another sprinkle</s> as she spoke mrs</s>  jo stooped to turn the pillow and smooth thebedclothes when to her great surprise dan put his arm around herneck drew her face down to his and kissed her with a broken thankyou maam which said more than the most eloquent speech could havedone for the hasty kiss the muttered words meant im sorry i willtry</s>  she understood it accepted the unspoken confession and did notspoil it by any token of surprise</s>  she only remembered that he had nomother kissed the brown cheek half hidden on the pillow as if ashamedof the little touch of tenderness and left him saying what he longremembered you are my boy now and if you choose you can make me proudand glad to say so</s> once again just at dawn she stole down to find him so fast asleepthat he did not wake and showed no sign of consciousness as she wet hisfoot except that the lines of pain smoothed themselves away and lefthis face quite peaceful</s> the day was sunday and the house so still that he never waked till nearnoon and looking round him saw an eager little face peering in atthe door</s>  he held out his arms and teddy tore across the room to casthimself bodily upon the bed shouting my dannys tum</s>  as he huggedand wriggled with delight</s>  mrs</s>  bhaer appeared next bringing breakfastand never seeming to see how shamefaced dan looked at the memory of thelittle scene last night</s>  teddy insisted on giving him his betfus andfed him like a baby which as he was not very hungry dan enjoyed verymuch</s> then came the doctor and the poor spartan had a bad time of it forsome of the little bones in his foot were injured and putting them torights was such a painful job that dans lips were white and greatdrops stood on his forehead though he never cried out and only heldmrs</s>  jos hand so tight that it was red long afterwards</s> you must keep this boy quiet for a week at least and not let him puthis foot to the ground</s>  by that time i shall know whether he may hop alittle with a crutch or stick to his bed for a while longer said dr</s> firth putting up the shining instruments that dan did not like to see</s> it will get well sometime wont it</s>  he asked looking alarmed at theword crutches</s> i hope so and with that the doctor departed leaving dan muchdepressed for the loss of a foot is a dreadful calamity to an activeboy</s> dont be troubled i am a famous nurse and we will have you trampingabout as well as ever in a month said mrs</s>  jo taking a hopeful viewof the case</s> but the fear of being lame haunted dan and even teddys caresses didnot cheer him so mrs</s>  jo proposed that one or two of the boys shouldcome in and pay him a little visit and asked whom he would like to see</s> nat and demi id like my hat too theres something in it i guesstheyd like to see</s>  i suppose you threw away my bundle of plunder</s>  saiddan looking rather anxious as he put the question</s> no i kept it for i thought they must be treasures of some kind youtook such care of them and mrs</s>  jo brought him his old straw hatstuck full of butterflies and beetles and a handkerchief containing acollection of odd things picked up on his way birds eggs carefullydone up in moss curious shells and stones bits of fungus and severallittle crabs in a state of great indignation at their imprisonment</s> could i have something to put these fellers in</s>  mr</s>  hyde and i foundem and they are firstrate ones so id like to keep and watch emcan i</s>  asked dan forgetting his foot and laughing to see the crabs gosidling and backing over the bed</s> of course you can pollys old cage will be just the thing</s>  dont letthem nip teddys toes while i get it and away went mrs</s>  jo leavingdan overjoyed to find that his treasures were not considered rubbishand thrown away</s> nat demi and the cage arrived together and the crabs were settledin their new house to the great delight of the boys who in theexcitement of the performance forgot any awkwardness they mightotherwise have felt in greeting the runaway</s>  to these admiring listenersdan related his adventures much more fully than he had done to thebhaers</s>  then he displayed his plunder and described each article sowell that mrs</s>  jo who had retired to the next room to leave themfree was surprised and interested as well as amused at their boyishchatter</s> how much the lad knows of these things</s>  how absorbed he is in them</s>  andwhat a mercy it is just now for he cares so little for books it wouldbe hard to amuse him while he is laid up but the boys can supply himwith beetles and stones to any extent and i am glad to find out thistaste of his it is a good one and may perhaps prove the making of him</s> if he should turn out a great naturalist and nat a musician i shouldhave cause to be proud of this years work and mrs</s>  jo sat smilingover her book as she built castles in the air just as she used to dowhen a girl only then they were for herself and now they were forother people which is the reason perhaps that some of them came topass in reality for charity is an excellent foundation to build anythingupon</s> nat was most interested in the adventures but demi enjoyed the beetlesand butterflies immensely drinking in the history of their changefullittle lives as if it were a new and lovely sort of fairy tale for evenin his plain way dan told it well and found great satisfaction in thethought that here at least the small philosopher could learn of him</s>  sointerested were they in the account of catching a musk rat whose skinwas among the treasures that mr</s>  bhaer had to come himself to tell natand demi it was time for the walk</s>  dan looked so wistfully after them asthey ran off that father bhaer proposed carrying him to the sofa in theparlor for a little change of air and scene</s> when he was established and the house quiet mrs</s>  jo who sat nearby showing teddy pictures said in an interested tone as she noddedtowards the treasures still in dans handswhere did you learn so much about these things</s> i always liked em but didnt know much till mr</s>  hyde told me</s> oh he was a man who lived round in the woods studying these things idont know what you call him and wrote about frogs and fishes and soon</s>  he stayed at pages and used to want me to go and help him and itwas great fun cause he told me ever so much and was uncommon jollyand wise</s>  hope ill see him again sometime</s> i hope you will said mrs</s>  jo for dans face had brightened up andhe was so interested in the matter that he forgot his usual taciturnity</s> why he could make birds come to him and rabbits and squirrels didntmind him any more than if he was a tree</s>  did you ever tickle a lizardwith a straw</s>  asked dan eagerly</s> no but i should like to try it</s> well ive done it and its so funny to see em turn over and stretchout they like it so much</s>  mr</s>  hyde used to do it and hed make snakeslisten to him while he whistled and he knew just when certain flowerswould blow and bees wouldnt sting him and hed tell the wonderfullestthings about fish and flies and the indians and the rocks</s> i think you were so fond of going with mr</s>  hyde you rather neglectedmr</s>
 page said mrs</s>  jo slyly</s> yes i did i hated to have to weed and hoe when i might be trampinground with mr</s>  hyde</s>  page thought such things silly and called mr</s>  hydecrazy because hed lay hours watching a trout or a bird</s> suppose you say lie instead of lay it is better grammar said mrs</s> jo very gently and then added yes page is a thorough farmer andwould not understand that a naturalists work was just as interestingand perhaps just as important as his own</s>
 now dan if you really lovethese things as i think you do and i am glad to see it you shall havetime to study them and books to help you but i want you to do somethingbesides and to do it faithfully else you will be sorry by and by andfind that you have got to begin again</s> yes maam said dan meekly and looked a little scared by theserious tone of the last remarks for he hated books yet had evidentlymade up his mind to study anything she proposed</s> do you see that cabinet with twelve drawers in it</s>  was the next veryunexpected question</s> dan did see two tall oldfashioned ones standing on either side of thepiano he knew them well and had often seen nice bits of string nailsbrown paper and such useful matters come out of the various drawers</s>  henodded and smiled</s>  mrs</s>  jo went onwell dont you think those drawers would be good places to put youreggs and stones and shells and lichens</s> oh splendid but you wouldnt like my things clutterin round asmr</s>  page used to say would you</s>  cried dan sitting up to survey theold piece of furniture with sparkling eyes</s> i like litter of that sort and if i didnt i should give you thedrawers because i have a

conquered faults and a promisewell kept</s>  shall we do this dan</s> the boys answered with one of the looks which said much for it showedthat he felt and understood her wish and words although he did not knowhow to express his interest and gratitude for such care and kindness</s> she understood the look and seeing by the color that flushed up to hisforehead that he was touched as she wished him to be she said no moreabout that side of the new plan but pulled out the upper drawer dustedit and set it on two chairs before the sofa saying brisklynow let us begin at once by putting those nice beetles in a safeplace</s>  these compartments will hold a good deal you see</s>  id pin thebutterflies and bugs round the sides they will be quite safe there andleave room for the heavy things

to give them to you arent theybeautiful ones</s>  panted demi all out of breath</s> dan laughed at the toad and said he had no place to put him but thebutterfly was a beauty and if mrs</s>  jo would give him a big pin hewould stick it right up in the drawer</s> i dont like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin if it must bekilled let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor

the pale green wings fluttered an instant and thengrew still</s> this dainty little execution was hardly over when teddy shouted from thebedroom oh the little trabs are out and the big ones eaten emall up</s>  demi and his aunt ran to the rescue and found teddy dancingexcitedly in a chair while two little crabs were scuttling about thefloor having got through the wires of the cage</s>  a third was clinging tothe top of the cage evidently in terror of his life for below appeareda sad yet funny sight</s>  the big crab had wedged himself into the littlerecess where pollys cup used to stand and there he sat eating one ofhis relations in the coolest way</s>  all the claws of the poor victim werepulled off and he was turned upside down his upper shell held inone claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish while heleisurely ate out of it with the other claw pausing now and then toturn his queer bulging eyes from side to side and to put out a slendertongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream withlaughter</s>  mrs</s>  jo carried the cage in for dan to see the sight whiledemi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted washbowl</s> ill have to let

to talk of the matterto ask pardon or express any remorse</s>  days passed and he went abouthis lessons and his work silent grim and unrepentant</s>  as if takingwarning by their treatment of nat he asked no sympathy of any onerejected the advances of the boys and spent his leisure hours roamingabout the fields and woods trying to find playmates in the birds andbeasts and succeeding better than

bhaers surprise and mrs</s>  jos great satisfaction</s>  the commodore didgrowl at dans promotion but was pacified by a superior padlock to hisnew boathouse and the thought that seamen were meant for

pummelling jack who wasroaring for mercy under his knee</s> why dan i thought you had given up fighting he said as he went tothe rescue</s> we aint fighting we are only wrestling answered dan leaving offreluctantly</s> it looks very much like it and feels like it hey jack</s>  said mr</s> bhaer as the defeated gentleman got upon his legs with difficulty</s> catch me wrestling with him again</s>  hes most knocked my head offsnarled jack holding on to that portion of his frame as if it reallywas loose upon his shoulders</s> the fact is we began in fun but when i got him down i couldnt

so if you dont want to be pounded youd better keep outof the way answered dan with a warning look in his black eyes thatmade jack sheer off in haste</s> if you want something to wrestle with i will give you a tougherspecimen than jack said mr</s>  bhaer and leading the way to thewoodyard he pointed out certain roots of trees that had been grubbedup in the spring and had been lying there waiting

toughroot and went at it so vigorously that the chips flew far and wideand mr</s>  bhaer fled for his life</s> to his great amusement dan took him at his word and was often seenwrestling with the ungainly knots hat and jacket off red face andwrathful eyes for he got into royal rages over some of his adversariesand swore at them under his breath till he had conquered them when heexulted and marched off to the shed with an armful of gnarled oakwoodin triumph</s>  he blistered his hands tired his back and dulled the axebut it did him good and he got more comfort out of the ugly roots

said mrs</s>  joto herself for no inspiration came and she was at the end of herresources</s> but dan found a new occupation for himself and enjoyed it some timebefore any one discovered the cause of his contentment</s>  a fine younghorse of mr</s>  lauries was kept at plumfield that summer running loosein a large pasture across the brook</s>  the boys were all interested in thehandsome spirited creature and for a time were fond of watching himgallop and frisk with his plumey tail flying and his handsome headin the air</s>  but they soon got tired of it and left prince charlie tohimself</s>  all but dan he never tired of looking at the horse and seldomfailed to visit him each day with a lump of sugar a bit of bread oran apple to make him welcome</s>  charlie was grateful accepted hisfriendship and the two loved one another as if they felt some tiebetween them inexplicable but strong</s>  in whatever part of the widefield he might be charlie always came at full speed when dan whistledat the bars and the boy was never happier than when the beautifulfleet creature put its head on his shoulder looking up at him with fineeyes full of intelligent affection</s> we understand one

is such a gentle finetempered brute</s>  ishall come out and try him with a saddle myself some day he said onone of these visits</s> he lets me put a halter on him but i dont believe he will bear

harshly treated so though he will be surprised at thenew performance i think he wont be frightened and his antics will dono harm</s> i wonder what he would do said dan to himself as mr</s>  laurie wentaway with the professor and charlie returned to the bars from which hehad retired when the gentlemen came up</s> a daring fancy to try the experiment took possession of the boy as hesat on the topmost rail with the glossy back temptingly near him</s> never thinking of danger he obeyed the impulse and while charlieunsuspectingly nibbled at the apple he held dan quickly and quietlytook his seat</s>  he did not keep it long however for with an astonishedsnort charlie reared straight up and deposited dan on the ground</s>  thefall did not hurt him for the turf was soft and he jumped up sayingwith a laughi did it anyway</s>  come here you rascal and ill try it again</s> but charlie declined to approach and dan left him resolving to succeedin the end for a struggle like this suited him exactly</s>  next time hetook a halter and having got it on he played with the horse for awhile leading him to and fro and putting him through various anticstill he was a little tired then dan sat on the wall and gave him breadbut watched his chance and getting a good grip of the halter slippedon to his back</s>  charlie tried the old trick but dan held on having hadpractice with toby who

he had not belonged to the class of boys who go through allsorts of dangers unscathed he would have broken his neck as it was hegot a heavy fall and lay still collecting his wits while charlie toreround the field tossing his head with every sign of satisfaction atthe discomfiture of his rider</s>  presently it seemed to occur to him thatsomething was wrong with dan and being of a magnanimous nature hewent to see what the matter was</s>  dan let him sniff about and perplexhimself for a few minutes then he looked up at him saying asdecidedly as if the horse could understandyou think you have beaten but you are mistaken old boy and ill rideyou yet see if i dont</s> he tried no more that day but soon after attempted a new method ofintroducing charlie to a burden</s>  he strapped a folded blanket on hisback and then let him race and rear and roll and fume as much ashe liked</s>  after a few fits of rebellion charlie submitted and in a fewdays permitted dan to mount him often stopped short to look round asif he said half patiently half reproachfully i dont understand itbut i suppose you mean no harm so i permit the liberty</s> dan patted and praised him and took a short turn every day gettingfrequent falls but persisting in spite of them and longing to try asaddle and bridle but not daring to confess what he had done</s>  he hadhis wish however for there had been a witness of his pranks who said agood word for him</s> do you know what that chap has ben doin lately</s>  asked silas of hismaster one evening as he received his orders for the next day</s>

to inquire into the matter</s> dan owned up at once and proudly proved that silas was right by showingoff his power over charlie for by dint of much coaxing many carrotsand infinite perseverance he really had succeeded in riding the coltwith a halter and blanket</s>  mr</s>  laurie was much amused and well pleasedwith dans courage and skill and let him have a hand in all futureperformances for he set about charlies education at once sayingthat he was not going to be outdone by a slip of a boy</s>  thanks to dancharlie took kindly to the saddle and bridle when he had once reconciledhimself to the indignity of the bit and after mr</s>  laurie had trainedhim a little dan was permitted to ride him to the great envy andadmiration of the other boys</s> isnt he handsome</s>  and dont he mind

it suited mrs</s>  jo becausejust then her heart was very tender and remembering that many of herboys were fatherless or motherless she yearned over them and foundcomfort in their blundering

she felt that she had done well for not only did themoment comfort her with the assurance that johns last lullaby was sungby the young voices he loved so well but in the faces of the boys shesaw that

good son andgave up his own plans to stay and live with his mother while she neededhim</s>  he was a good friend and taught laurie much beside his greek andlatin did it unconsciously perhaps by

bhaer stopped a minute and the boys sat like statues in themoonlight until he went on again in a subdued but earnest voice ashe lay dying i said to him have no care for meg and the little onesi will

inorder not a debt remained and safely put away was enough to keep megcomfortable and independent</s>  then we knew why he had lived so plainlydenied himself so many pleasures except that of charity and workedso hard that i fear he shortened his good life</s>  he never asked help forhimself though often for others but bore his own burden and workedout his own task bravely and quietly</s>  no one

when demi returned to school after some weeks at home he seemed tohave recovered from his loss with the blessed elasticity of childhoodand so he had in a measure but he did not forget for his was a natureinto which things sank deeply to be pondered over and absorbed intothe soil where the small virtues were growing fast</s>  he played andstudied worked and sang just as before and few suspected any changebut there was one and aunt jo saw it for she watched over the boy withher whole heart trying to fill johns place in her poor way</s>  he seldomspoke of his loss but aunt jo often heard a stifled sobbing in thelittle bed at night and when she went to comfort him all his cry wasi want my father</s>  oh i want my father</s>  for the tie between the twohad been a very tender one and the childs heart bled when it wasbroken</s>  but time was kind to him and slowly he came to feel that fatherwas not lost only invisible for a while and sure to be found againwell and strong and fond as ever even though his little son should seethe purple asters blossom on his grave many many times before they met</s> to this belief demi held fast and in it found both help and comfortbecause it led him unconsciously through a tender longing for the fatherwhom he had seen to a childlike trust in the father whom he had notseen</s>  both were in heaven and he prayed to both trying to be good forlove of them</s> the outward change corresponded to the inward for in those few weeksdemi seemed to have grown tall and began to drop his childish playsnot as if ashamed of them as some boys do but as if he had outgrownthem and wanted something manlier</s>  he took to the hated arithmeticand held on so steadily that his uncle was charmed though he could notunderstand the whim until demi saidi am going to be a bookkeeper when i grow up like papa and i mustknow about figures and things else i cant have nice neat ledgers likehis</s> at another time he came to his aunt with a very serious face

earn pennies sometimes</s> well then suppose you rake up all the dead leaves and cover thestrawberry bed</s>  ill pay you a dollar for the job said aunt jo</s> isnt that a great deal</s>  i could do it in one day</s>  you must be fairand no pay too much because i want to truly earn it</s> my little john i will be fair and not pay a penny too much</s>  dontwork too hard and when that is done i will have something else for youto do said mrs</s>  jo much touched by his desire to help and his senseof justice so like his scrupulous father</s> when the leaves were done many barrowloads of chips were wheeled fromthe wood to the shed and another dollar earned</s>  then demi helpedcover the schoolbooks working in the evenings under franzs directiontugging patiently away at each book letting no one help and receivinghis wages with such satisfaction that the dingy bills became quiteglorified in his sight</s> now i have a dollar for each of them and i should like to takemy money to mother all myself so she can see that i have minded myfather</s> so demi made a duteous pilgrimage to his mother who received his littleearnings as a treasure of great worth and would have kept it untouchedif demi had not begged her to buy some useful thing for herself and thewomenchildren whom he felt were left to his care</s> this made him very happy and though he often forgot hisresponsibilities for a

some one had stolen all the fruit out ofthem by lifting up the upper crust and then putting it down after thegooseberry had been scraped out</s> what a mean trick</s>  and nan looked at tommy as if to imply that hewould do the same</s> when she told the boys her plan and showed them the poor littlepatties all robbed of their sweetness the boys were much grieved anddisappointed and all declared that they knew nothing about the matter</s> perhaps the rats did it said lewis who was among the loudest to denyany knowledge of the tarts</s>  no rats would have nibbled crust and alland never lifted it up and scooped out the fruit</s>  hands did that saidmiss crane who was more troubled about the lie that some one must havetold than about her lost patties</s>  well they had supper and went to bedbut in the night miss crane heard some one groaning and going tosee who it was she found lewis in great pain</s>  he had evidently eatensomething that disagreed with him and was so sick that miss crane wasalarmed and was going to send for the doctor when lewis moaned outits the gooseberries i ate them and i must tell before i die forthe thought of a doctor frightened him</s>  if that is all ill give youan emetic and you will soon get over it said miss crane</s>  so lewis hada good dose and by morning was quite comfortable</s>  oh dont tell theboys they will laugh at me so begged the invalid</s>  kind miss cranepromised not to but sally the girl told the story and poor lewis hadno peace for a long time</s>  his mates called him old gooseberry and werenever tired of asking him the price of tarts</s> served him right said emil</s> badness always gets found out added demi morally</s> no it dont muttered jack who was tending the apples with greatdevotion so that he might keep his back to the rest and account for hisred face</s> is that all</s>  asked dan</s> no that is only the first part the second part is more interesting</s> some time after this a peddler came by one day and stopped to show histhings to the boys several of whom bought pocketcombs jewsharpsand various trifles of that sort</s>  among the knives was a littlewhitehandled penknife that lewis wanted very much but he had spent allhis pocketmoney and no one had any to lend him</s>  he held the knife inhis hand admiring and longing for it till the man packed up his goodsto go then he reluctantly laid it down and the man went on his way</s> the next day however the peddler returned to say that he could notfind that very knife and thought he must have left it at miss cranes</s> it was a very nice one with a pearl handle and he could not affordto lose it</s>  every one looked and every one declared they knew nothingabout it</s>  this young gentleman had it last and seemed to want it verymuch</s>  are you quite sure you put it back</s>  said the man to lewis whowas much troubled at the loss and vowed over and over again that he didreturn it</s>  his denials seemed to do no good however for every one wassure he had taken it and after a stormy scene miss crane paid for itand the man went grumbling away</s> did lewis have it</s>  cried nat much excited</s> you will see</s>  now poor lewis had another trial to bear for the boyswere constantly saying lend me your pearlhandled knife gooseberryand things of that sort till lewis was so unhappy he begged to be senthome</s>  miss crane did her best to keep the boys quiet but it was hardwork for they would tease and she could not be with them all thetime</s>  that is one of the hardest things to teach boys they wont hita fellow when he is down as they say but they will torment him inlittle ways till he would thank them to fight it out all round</s> i know that said dan</s> so do i added nat softly</s> jack said nothing but he quite agreed for he knew that the elder boysdespised him and let him alone for that very reason</s> do go on about poor lewis aunt jo</s>  i dont believe he took the knifebut i want to be sure said daisy in great anxiety</s> well week after week went on and the matter was not cleared up</s> the boys avoided lewis and he poor fellow was almost sick with thetrouble he had brought upon himself</s>  he resolved never to tell anotherlie and tried so hard that miss crane pitied and helped him and reallycame at last to believe that he did not take the knife</s>  two months afterthe peddlers first visit he came again and the first thing he saidwaswell maam i found that knife after all</s>  it had slipped behind thelining of my valise and fell out the other day when i was putting in anew stock of goods</s>  i thought id call and let you know as you paid forit and maybe would like it so here it is</s> the boys had all gathered round and at these words they felt muchashamed and begged lewis pardon so heartily that he could not refuseto give it</s>  miss crane presented the knife to him and he kept it manyyears to remind him of the fault that had brought him so much trouble</s> i wonder why it is that things you eat on the sly hurt you and dontwhen you eat them at table observed stuffy thoughtfully</s> perhaps your conscience affects your stomach said mrs</s>  jo smiling athis speech</s> he is thinking of the cucumbers said ned and a gale of merrimentfollowed the words for stuffys last mishap had been a funny one</s> he ate two large cucumbers in private felt very ill and confidedhis anguish to ned imploring him to do something</s>  ned goodnaturedlyrecommended a mustard plaster and a hot flat iron to the feet only inapplying these remedies he reversed the order of

you have eaten these twelve popcorns said hismother expecting to see them vanish at one mouthful</s> but rob was a shrewd little man and got the better of her by eatingthem one by one very slowly and enjoying every minute with all hismight</s> hadnt you better tell the other story while you wait for him</s>  saiddemi anxious that no time should be lost</s> i really have nothing but a little tale about a woodbox said mrs</s> jo seeing that rob had still seven corns to eat</s> is there a boy in it</s> it is all boy</s> is it true</s>  asked demi</s> every bit of it</s> goody</s>  tell on please</s> james snow and his mother lived in a little house up in new hampshire</s> they were poor and james had to work to help his mother but he lovedbooks so well he hated work and just wanted to sit and study all daylong</s> how could he</s>  i hate books and like work said dan objecting tojames at the very outset</s> it takes all sorts of people to make a world workers and students bothare needed and there is room for all</s>  but i think the workers shouldstudy some and the students should know how to work if necessaryanswered mrs</s>  jo looking from dan to demi with a significantexpression</s> im sure i do work and demi showed three small hard spots in hislittle palm with pride</s> and im sure i study added dan nodding with a groan toward theblackboard full of neat figures</s> see what james did</s>  he did not mean to be selfish but his mother wasproud of him and let him do as he liked working by herself that hemight have books and time to read them</s>  one autumn james wanted to goto school and went to the minister to see if he would help him aboutdecent clothes and books</s>  now the minister had heard the gossip aboutjamess idleness and was not inclined to do much for him thinkingthat a boy who neglected his mother and let her slave for him wasnot likely to do very well even at school</s>  but the good man felt moreinterested when he found how earnest james was and being rather an oddman he made this proposal to the boy to try now sincere he was</s> i will give you clothes and books on one condition james</s> what is that sir</s>  and the boy brightened up at once</s> you are to keep your mothers woodbox full all winter long and doit yourself</s>  if you fail school stops</s>  james laughed at the queercondition and readily agreed to it thinking it a very easy one</s> he began school and for a time got on capitally with the woodboxfor it was autumn and chips and brushwood were plentiful</s>  he ran outmorning and evening and got a basket full or chopped up the cat sticksfor the little cooking stove and as his mother was careful and savingthe task was not hard</s>  but in november the frost came the days weredull and cold and wood went fast</s>  his mother bought a load with her ownearnings but it seemed to melt away and was nearly gone before jamesremembered that he was to get the next</s>  mrs</s>  snow was feeble and lamewith rheumatism and unable to work as she had done so james had to putdown the books and see what he could do</s> it was hard for he was going on well and so interested in hislessons that he hated to stop except for food and sleep</s>  but he knew theminister would keep his word and much against his will james set aboutearning money in his spare hours lest the woodbox should get empty</s> he did all sorts of things ran errands took care of a neighbors cowhelped the old sexton dust and warm the church on sundays and in theseways got enough to buy fuel in small quantities</s>  but it was hard workthe days were short the winter was bitterly cold and precious timewent fast and the dear books were so fascinating that it was sad toleave them for dull duties that never seemed done</s> the minister watched him quietly and seeing that he was in earnesthelped him without his knowledge</s>  he met him often driving the woodsleds from the forest where the men were chopping and as james ploddedbeside the slow oxen he read or studied anxious to use every minute</s> the boy is worth helping this lesson will do him good and when hehas learned it i will give him an easier one said the ministerto himself and on christmas eve a splendid load of wood was quietlydropped at the door of the little house with a new saw and a bit ofpaper saying onlythe lord helps those who help themselves</s> poor james expected nothing but when he woke on that cold christmasmorning he found a pair of warm mittens knit by his mother with herstiff painful fingers</s>  this gift pleased him very much but her kissand tender look as she called him her good son was better still</s>  intrying to keep her warm he had warmed his own heart you see andin filling the woodbox he had also filled those months with dutiesfaithfully done</s>  he began to see this to feel that there was somethingbetter than books and to try to learn the lessons god set him as wellas those his schoolmaster gave</s> when he saw the great pile of oak and pine logs at his door and readthe little paper he knew who sent it and understood the ministersplan thanked him for it and fell to work with all his might</s>  otherboys frolicked that day but james sawed wood and i think of allthe lads in the town the happiest was the one in the new mittens whowhistled like a blackbird as he filled his mothers

in a chaise to another town he came to a lonely bit ofroad late in the afternoon and was just thinking what a good place itwas for robbers when he saw a badlooking man come out of the woodsin front of
