embarrassmentsby henry james1896contentsthe figure in the carpetglassesthe next timethe way it camethe figure in the carpetii had done a few things and earned a few pencei had perhaps evenhad time to begin to think i was finer than was perceived by thepatronising but when i take the little measure of my course a fidgetyhabit for its none of the longest yet i count my real start fromthe evening george corvick breathless and worried came in to ask me aservice</s>  he had done more things than i and earned more pence thoughthere were chances for cleverness i thought he sometimes missed</s>  i couldonly however that evening declare to him that he never missed one forkindness</s>  there was almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me toprepare for the middle the organ of our lucubrations so calledfrom the position in the week of its day of appearance an article forwhich he had made himself responsible and of which tied up with astout string he laid on my table the subject</s>
 what explanation could be moreto the point than my obvious fitness for the task</s>  i had written on hughvereker but never a word in the middle where my dealings were mainlywith the ladies and the minor poets</s>  this was his new novel an advancecopy and whatever much or little it should do for his reputation iwas clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine</s>  moreover if ialways read him as soon as i could get hold of him i had a particularreason for wishing to read him now i had accepted an invitation tobridges for the following sunday and it had been mentioned in ladyjanes note that mr</s>  vereker was to be there</s>  i was young enough to havean emotion about meeting a man of his renown and innocent enough tobelieve the occasion would demand the display of an acquaintance withhis last</s> corvick who had promised a review of it had not even had time toread it he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiringas onprecipitate reflection he judgedthat he should catch the nightmail toparis</s>  he had had a telegram from gwendolen erme in answer to his letteroffering to fly to her aid</s>  i knew already about gwendolen erme i hadnever seen her but i had my ideas which were mainly to the effect thatcorvick would marry her if her mother would only die</s>  that lady seemednow in a fair way to oblige him after some dreadful mistake about someclimate or some waters she had suddenly collapsed on the return fromabroad</s>  her daughter unsupported and alarmed desiring to make arush for home but hesitating at the risk had accepted our friendsassistance and it was my secret belief that at the sight of him mrs</s> erme would pull round</s>  his own belief was scarcely to be calledsecret it discernibly at any rate differed from mine</s>

suffer by ourarrangement</s>  speak of him you know if you can as should have spokenof him</s> i wondered an instant</s>  you mean as far and away the biggest of thelotthat sort of thing</s> corvick almost groaned</s>  oh you know i dont put them back to backthat way its the infancy of art</s>  but he gives me a pleasure so rarethe sense of he mused a littlesomething or other</s> i wondered again</s>  the sense pray of what</s> my dear man thats just what i want you to say</s> even before corvick had banged the door i had begun book in hand toprepare myself to say it</s>  i sat up with vereker half the night corvickcouldnt have done more than that</s>  he was awfully cleveri stuck tothat but he wasnt a bit the biggest of the lot</s>  i didnt allude to thelot however i flattered myself that i emerged on this occasion fromthe infancy of art</s>  its all right they declared vividly at theoffice and when the number appeared i felt there was a basis on whichi could meet the great man it gave me confidence for a day or two andthen that confidence dropped</s>  i had fancied him reading it with relishbut if corvick was not satisfied how could vereker himself be</s>  ireflected indeed that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser eventhan the appetite of the scribe</s>  corvick at all events wrote me fromparis a little illhumouredly</s>  mrs</s>  erme was pulling round and i hadntat all said what vereker gave him the sense of</s> iithe effect of my visit to bridges was to turn me out for moreprofundity</s>  hugh vereker as i saw him there was of a contact so voidof angles that i blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in mysmall precautions</s>  if he was in spirits it was not because he had readmy review in fact on the sunday morning i felt sure he hadnt readit though the middle had been out three days and bloomed i assuredmyself in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolutables the air of a stand at a station</s>  the impression he made on mepersonally was such that i wished him to read it and i corrected tothis end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the carelessconspicuity of the sheet</s>  i am afraid i even watched the result of mymanouvre but up to luncheon i watched in vain</s> when afterwards in the course of our gregarious walk i found myselffor half an hour not perhaps without another manoeuvre at the greatmans side the result of his affability was a still livelier desirethat he should not remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice i haddone him</s>  it was not that he seemed to thirst for justice on thecontrary i had not yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of agrudgea note for which my young experience had already given me anear</s>  of late he had had more recognition and it was pleasant as weused to say in the middle to see that it drew him out</s>  he wasnt ofcourse popular but i judged one of the sources of his good humour to beprecisely that his success was independent of that</s>  he had none the lessbecome in a manner the fashion the critics at least had put on a spurtand caught up with him</s>  we had found out at last how clever he was andhe had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery</s>  i was stronglytempted as i walked beside him to let him know how much of thatunveiling was my act and there was a moment when i probably should havedone so had not one of the ladies of our party snatching a place athis other elbow just then appealed to him in a spirit comparativelyselfish</s>  it was very discouraging i almost felt the liberty had beentaken with myself</s> i had had on my tongues end for my own part a phrase or two aboutthe right word at the right time but later on i was glad not to havespoken for when on our return we clustered at tea i perceived ladyjane who had not been out with us brandishing the middle with herlongest arm</s>  she had taken it up at her leisure she was delighted withwhat she had found and i saw that as a mistake in a man may often be afelicity in a woman she would practically do for me what i hadntbeen able to do for myself</s>  some sweet little truths that needed to bespoken i heard her declare thrusting the paper at rather a bewilderedcouple by the fireplace</s>  she grabbed it away from them again on thereappearance of hugh vereker who after our walk had been upstairs tochange something</s>  i know you dont in general look at this kind ofthing but its an occasion really for doing so</s>  you havent seen it</s> then you must</s>  the man has actually got at you at what i alwaysfeel you know</s>  lady jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intendedto give an idea of what she always felt but she added that she couldnthave expressed it</s>  the man in the paper expressed it in a strikingmanner</s>  just see there and there where ive dashed it how he bringsit out</s>  she had literally marked for him the brightest patches of myprose and if i was a little amused vereker himself may well have been</s> he showed how much he was when before us all lady jane wanted to readsomething aloud</s>  i liked at any rate the way he defeated her purposeby jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch</s>  he would take itupstairs with him would look at it on going to dress</s>  he did this halfan hour lateri saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room</s>  thatwas the moment at which thinking to give her pleasure i mentioned tolady jane that i was the author of the review</s>  i did give her pleasurei judged but perhaps not quite so much as i had expected</s>  if the authorwas only me the thing didnt seem quite so remarkable</s>  hadnt i hadthe effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than ofadding to my own</s>  her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinarydrops</s>  it didnt matter the only effect i cared about was the one itwould have on vereker up there by his bedroom fire</s> at dinner i watched for the signs of this impression tried to fancythere was some happier light in his eyes but to my disappointmentlady jane gave me no chance to make sure</s>  i had hoped she would calltriumphantly down the table publicly demand if she hadnt been right</s> the party was largethere were people from outside as well but i hadnever seen a table long enough to deprive lady jane of a triumph</s>  i wasjust reflecting in truth that this interminable board would depriveme of one when the guest next me dear womanshe was miss poyle thevicars sister a robust unmodulated personhad the happy inspirationand the unusual courage to address herself across it to vereker whowas opposite but not directly so that when he replied they were bothleaning forward</s>  she inquired artless body what he thought of ladyjanes panegyric which she had readnot connecting it however withher righthand neighbour and while i strained my ear for his reply iheard him to my stupefaction call back gaily with his mouth full ofbread oh its all rightits the usual twaddle</s> i had caught verekers glance as he spoke but miss poyles surprise wasa fortunate cover for my own</s>
 saidthe excellent woman</s> vereker laughed out and i was happy to be able to do the same</s>  its acharming article he tossed us</s> miss poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth</s> oh youre so deep</s>  she drove home</s> as deep as the ocean</s>  all i pretend is the author doesnt seea dish was at this point passed over his shoulder and we had to waitwhile he helped himself</s> doesnt see what</s>  my neighbour continued</s> doesnt see anything</s> dear mehow very stupid</s> not a bit vereker laughed again</s>  nobody does</s> the lady on his further side appealed to him and miss poyle sank backto me</s>  nobody sees anything</s>  she cheerfully announced to which ireplied that i had often thought so too but had somehow taken thethought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye</s>  i didnt tellher the article was mine and i observed that lady jane occupied at theend of the table had not caught verekers words</s> i rather avoided him after dinner for i confess he struck me as cruellyconceited and the revelation was a pain</s>  the usual twaddlemy acutelittle study</s>  that ones admiration should have had a reserve or twocould gall him to that point</s>  i had thought him placid and he wasplacid enough such a surface was the hard polished glass that encasedthe bauble of his vanity</s>  i was really ruffled the only comfort wasthat if nobody saw anything george corvick was quite as much out ofit as i</s>  this comfort however was not sufficient after the ladies haddispersed to carry me in the proper manneri mean in a spottedjacket and humming an airinto the smokingroom</s>  i took my way in somedejection to bed but in the passage i encountered mr</s>  vereker who hadbeen up once more to change coming out of his room</s>  he was hummingan air and had on a spotted jacket and as soon as he saw me his gaietygave a start</s> my dear young man he exclaimed im so glad to lay hands on you</s>  imafraid i most unwittingly wounded you by those words of mine at dinnerto miss poyle</s>  i learned but half an hour ago from lady jane that youwrote the little notice in the middle</s> i protested that no bones were broken but he moved with me to my owndoor his hand on my shoulder kindly feeling for a fracture and onhearing that i had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my thresholdand just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks hadrepresented</s>  it was plain he really feared i was hurt and the sense ofhis solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me</s>  my cheap reviewfluttered off into space and the best things i had said in it becameflat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there</s>  i can see himthere still on my rug in the firelight and his spotted jacket hisfine clear face all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth</s>  idont know what he had at first meant to say but i think the sight ofmy relief touched him excited him brought up words to his lips fromfar within</s>  it was so these words presently conveyed to me somethingthat as i afterwards knew he had never uttered to any one</s>  i havealways done justice to the generous impulse that made him speak it wassimply compunction for a snub unconsciously administered to a man ofletters in a position inferior to his own a man of letters moreover inthe very act of praising him</s>  to make the thing right he talked to meexactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved best</s>  thehour the place the unexpectedness deepened the impression he couldnthave done anything more exquisitely successful</s>

waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speakto her</s>  in this way i saw that if one of floras attendants was theinevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regularcourt always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of acigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small paleyouth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the

stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of theshadowpatches on the sea</s>  she showed for the passing instant the faceof some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence ofit what mrs</s>  meldrum had said about her sight</s>  i had derived from thislady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didnt seem exactlykind so i substituted another question inquired who the

 i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yetwhat should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty andsuch joy</s>  i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietorand though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldntlike his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer thatthe girl mightnt miss her possible fortune</s> ivone day in the course of the following june there was ushered into mystudio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been verybriefly in correspondence</s>  a letter from him had expressed to me somedays before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of titrasflora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in thecatalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a

for her asthat</s>  i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me tobe sorrier still for other victims of this compassion</s>  with dawling aswith me the compassion was at first in

studio miss saunt quite gave it up andi finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to putpressure on her to marry him</s>  she didnt know i would take it that wayelse she wouldnt have brought him to see me</s>  it was in her view a partof the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last tosit to me</s>  i daresay moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had endedby

morethan a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff</s>  ithad been associated in that scene with showy knickerbockers atpresent it overflowed more splendidly into a furtrimmed overcoat</s>  lordiffields presence made me waver an instant before crossing over andduring that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she toowere after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me</s>  iwas on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her facegave no sign</s>  i was exactly in the line of her vision but she eitherdidnt see me or didnt recognise me or else had a reason to pretendshe didnt</s>  was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wishedto punish me</s>  i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasntvindictive</s>  she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment oneof the shopgirls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustledup to her with a small mechanical toy</s>  it so happened that i followedclosely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been ledto do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose byan impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious</s> flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion thenseeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she movedaway with the shopgirl who had evidently offered to conduct her intothe presence of more objects of the same sort</s>  when she reached theindicated spot i was in a position still to observe her</s>  she had askedsome question about the working of the toy and the girl taking itherself began to explain the little secret</s>  flora bent her head overit but she clearly didnt understand</s>  i saw her in a manner thatquickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from whichshe had come</s>  lord iffield was talking with another young person shesatisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her ownattendant</s>  she then drew closer to the table near which she stood andturning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toysand more particularly over the small object the girl had attemptedto explain</s>  she took it back and after a moment with her face wellaverted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck ofher head</s>  these slight signs singular as it may appear produced inmy bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffieldswhereabouts</s>  he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew itor before she knew it herself</s>  i felt at that instant the strangestof all impulses if it could have operated more rapidly it would havecaused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora awarning</s>  in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time hadi not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse</s>  therewere three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him comeon</s>  didnt i make the quick calculation that if he didnt catch whatflora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it</s>  she at any rateherself took the alarm</s>  on perceiving her companions nearness she madestill averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands soprecipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escapedfrom them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear atthis hour</s>  lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerkhe brought her round toward him</s>  then it was that there met my eyes aquite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaringexposed with a pair of big blackrimmed eyeglasses defacing her bytheir position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose</s>  she made a grabat

mystifiednever</s>  then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom howeverdisguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moments thought heexclaimed disguised</s>  as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened atrain</s>  shes not a bit myopic he said she doesnt blink or contracther lids</s>  i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogetherdenied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the groundof my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken placebefore me at the shop</s>  he knew all about lord iffield that noblemanhad figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injuriousrival</s>  poor dawlings contention was that if there had been a definiteengagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thingthat was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirementwould be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain forany such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not reallyclosed or were at any rate not cruelly locked</s>  he was naturally muchstruck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it</s> there is something there is somethingpossibly somethingvery grave certainly something that requires she should make use ofartificial aids</s>  she wont admit it publicly because with her idolatryof her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she

i heard this mystery hinted at and where sheindignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognisepeople</s>  at present she couldnt really make out anything the shopgirlshowed her</s>  she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her withthat she resorts in private to a pincenez and that she does so not onlyunder the strictest orders from an oculist but because literally

watch</s>  i happened tohave a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught herin the act</s> i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawlingturned pale as he listened to me</s> was he rough with her</s>  he anxiously asked</s> how can i tell what passed between them</s>  i fled from the place</s> my companion stared at me a moment</s>  do you mean to say her eyesightsgoing</s> heaven forbid</s>  in that case how could she take life as she does</s> how does she take life</s>  thats the question</s>  he sat therebewilderedly brooding the tears had come into his eyes they remindedme of those i had seen in floras the day i risked my inquiry</s>  thequestion he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready toanswer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflectionshad suggested</s>  i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity</s> for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing aparticular game at which he went on as if he hadnt heard me suddenlyhaunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility i had opened up doyou mean theres a danger of anything very bad</s>  my dear fellow youmust ask her oculist</s>  who in the world is her oculist</s>  i havent aconception</s>  but we mustnt get too excited</s>  my impression would bethat she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a littlecommon sense</s> dawling jumped at this</s>  i seeto stick to the pincenez</s> to follow to the letter her oculists prescription whatever it isand at whatever cost to her prettiness</s>  its not a thing to be trifledwith</s> upon my honour it shant be trifled with</s>  he roundly declared andhe adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settledthe business</s>  after a

continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry</s> it must have been horrible</s>  my companion murmured</s> it was horrible</s>  but its still more horrible to defy all warningsits still more horrible to be landed in without saying in what idisgustedly shrugged my shoulders</s> after a glance at me dawling jerked round</s>  then you do believe that shemay be</s> i hesitated</s>  the thing would be to make her believe it</s>  she onlyneeds a good scare</s> but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take</s> oh who knows</s>  i rejoined with small sincerity</s>  i dont supposeiffield is absolutely a brute</s> i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare</s>  criedgeoffrey dawling</s> i had an impression that iffield wouldnt but i didnt communicate itfor i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much forthe purposes of my sitting</s>  i recollect that i did some good work thatmorning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he hadpractically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself inhis mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious andunregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy</s>  hehad had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt tosubterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed thissecret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didnt andof cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw</s>  whenone patched things together it was astonishing what ground they covered</s>
just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestonethe horrid tale had proceeded</s>  when i had given him as i saw no reasonnot to do the name of mrs</s>
 meldrum he exclaimed oh i know allabout her shes a friend of some friends of mine</s>  at this i rememberedwilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probablyprove more wilful still</s> viiia few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before hepassed my threshold i knew he had something to tell me</s> ive been down to folkestoneit was necessary i should see her</s>  iforget whether he had come straight from the station he was at anyrate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute tointerpret</s>
you mean that youve been with mrs</s>  meldrum</s> yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it</s>  it workedupon me awfullyi mean what you told me</s>
 he made a visible effort toseem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he hadnot been reassured</s>  i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture afriendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them aninstant a strange distended look which might have expressed the coldclearness of all that was to come</s>  i knownow</s>  he said with anemphasis he rarely used</s> what then did mrs</s>  meldrum tell you</s> only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge</s>  but thatone thing was everything</s> what is it then</s> why that she cant bear the sight of her</s>  his pronouns required somearranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied thati knew perfectly miss saunt had a trick of turning her back on the goodlady of folkestone</s>  but what did that prove</s>  have you never guessed</s> i guessed as soon as she spoke</s>  dawling towered over me in dismaltriumph</s>  it was the first time in our acquaintance that intellectuallyspeaking this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident stillleft me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effectof those spectacles</s> i seemed to catch the tail of his idea</s>  mrs</s>  meldrums</s> theyre so awfully ugly and they increase so the dear womansugliness</s>  this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly addedshe sees herself she sees her own fate</s>  my response was so immediatethat i had almost taken the words out of his mouth</s>  while i tried tofix this sudden image of floras face glazed in and crossbarred even asmrs</s>  meldrums was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only thehorror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of heravoiding such a monitress</s>  the fact he had encountered made everythinghideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such anotherpair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora</s> i seei see i presently rejoined</s>  what would become of lord iffieldif she were suddenly to come out in them</s>  what indeed would become ofevery one what would become of everything</s>  this was an inquiry thatdawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by sayingat last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you</s> once more he turned on me his good green eyes</s>  oh i shouldnt mind</s> the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i feltthat there dated from this moment in my heart a confirmed affection forhim</s>  none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i becameaware of a certain drollery in our discussion of such alternatives</s>  itmade me laugh out and say to him while i laughed youd take her evenwith those things of mrs</s>  meldrums</s> he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at myrude mirth</s>  but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone andconscientiously replied even with those things of mrs</s>  meldrums</s> i begged him not to think my laughter in bad taste it was only apractical recognition of the fact that we had built a monstrous castlein the air</s>  didnt he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested</s> the evidence was preposterously small</s>  he believed the worst but wewere utterly ignorant</s> i shall find out the truth he promptly replied</s> how can you</s>  if you question her youll simply drive her to perjureherself</s>  wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth</s>  itsthe girls own affair</s> then why did you tell me your story</s> i was a trifle embarrassed</s>  to warn you off i returned smiling</s>  hetook no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lordiffield had no serious intentions</s>  very possibly i said</s>  but youmustnt speak as if

her what you suspect</s> i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this</s>  all righti promise he said gloomily enough</s>  he was a lover who could tacitlygrant the proposition that there

imputation of having failed to make it clear that shewould always be glad to regard him as a friend</s>  what were most of herfriendswhat were all of thembut repudiated idiots</s>  i was perfectlyaware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instancehad a niche in the gallery</s>  as regards poor dawling i knew how often hestill called on the hammond synges</s>  it was not there but under thewing of the floydtaylors that her intimacy with lord iffield mostflourished</s>  at all events when a week after the visit i have justsummarised floras name was one morning brought up to me i jumped atthe conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear brieflyentertained the thought that he had broken his word</s> ixshe left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about herpresent motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlightenme but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiablypanted our young man was not accountable</s>  she had but one thought inthe world and that thought was for lord iffield</s>  i had the strangestsaddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least mademe at last

pain</s>  she brought i confesstears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helplesspoverty</s>  her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as insome of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i wentthat afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days roomsin welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough towarrant the supposition that he might have come in</s>  he had not comein but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for hima lady i was informed was already in his sittingroom</s>  i hesitated alittle at a loss

did embrace dawling whosefirst emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been aconsciousness of guilt</s>  i had caught him somehow in the act though thatwas as yet all i knew but by the

 i asseverated with an energy adetermination that it should be so which comes back to me now almost asgrotesque</s>  but the sound of the word as it rang out filled me suddenlywith horror and all the

clung to his interpretation because he liked itbetter</s>  he liked it better i held because it had more to say to hisvanity</s>  that in a similar position would not have been its effecton me though

thought more ofmyself for being so distinguished</s>  it was public that he had alreadythat he had long been distinguished and what was this in itself butalmost a proof</s>  each of the strange
