wasat simlasemideserted simlaonce more and was deep in lovers talksand walks with kitty</s>  it was decided that we should be married at theend of june</s>  you will understand therefore that loving kitty as idid i am not saying too much when i pronounce myself to have been atthat time the happiest man in india</s> fourteen delightful days passed almost before i noticed theirflight</s>  then aroused to the sense of what was proper among mortalscircumstanced as we were i pointed out to kitty that an engagement ringwas the outward and visible sign of her dignity as an engaged girl andthat

april 1885</s> remember thatwhatever my doctor may say to the contraryi was then inperfect health enjoying a wellbalanced mind and an absolute tranquilspirit</s>  kitty and i entered hamiltons shop

slope that leads to the combermerebridge and pelitis shop</s> while my waler was cautiously feeling his way over the loose shale andkitty was laughing and chattering at my sidewhile all simla that

first plank of thecombermere bridge i had thought over half a dozen people who might havecommitted such a solecism and had eventually decided that it must havebeen singing in my ears</s>  immediately opposite pelitis shop my eye wasarrested by the sight of four jhampanies in magpie livery pulling ayellowpaneled cheap bazar rickshaw</s>  in a moment my mind flew back tothe previous season and mrs</s>  wessington with a sense of irritationand disgust</s>  was it not enough that the woman was dead and done withwithout her black and white servitors reappearing to spoil the dayshappiness</s>  whoever employed them now i thought i would call upon andask as a personal favor to change her jhampanies livery</s>  i would hirethe men myself and if necessary buy their coats from off their

them now</s> kitty had known mrs</s>  wessington slightly last season and had alwaysbeen interested in the sickly woman</s> what</s>  where</s>  she asked</s>  i cant see them anywhere</s> even as she

her breast</s> how long i stared motionless i do not know</s>  finally i was aroused bymy syce taking the walers bridle and asking whether i was ill</s>  from thehorrible to the commonplace is but a step</s>  i tumbled off my horse anddashed half fainting into pelitis for a glass of cherrybrandy</s>  theretwo or three couples were gathered round the coffeetables discussingthe gossip of the day</s>  their trivialities were more comforting to mejust then than the consolations of religion could have been</s>  i plungedinto the midst of the conversation at once chatted laughed and jestedwith a face when i caught a glimpse of it in a mirror as white anddrawn as that of a corpse</s>  three or four men noticed my condition andevidently setting it down to the results of overmany

despair</s>  the voice was as inexplicable as the apparition</s>  i hadoriginally some wild notion of confiding it all to kitty of begging herto marry me at once and in her arms defying the ghostly

resentment</s>  an hour later i was eatingone of the crows and as gunga dass had said thanking my god that ihad a crow to eat</s>  never as long as i live shall i forget that eveningmeal</s>  the whole population were squatting on the hard sand platformopposite their dens huddled over tiny fires of refuse and dried rushes</s> death having once laid his hand upon these men and forborne to

access of that suddenfury which had possessed me in the morning would lay hold on a man orwoman and with yells and imprecations the sufferer would attack thesteep slope until baffled and bleeding he

considerationvidelicet my bootshe would bewilling to allow me to occupy the den next to his own and would supplyme with as much dried grass for bedding as he could spare</s> very well gunga dass i replied to the first terms i cheerfullyagree but as there is nothing on earth to prevent my killing you asyou sit here and taking everything that you have i thought of the twoinvaluable crows at the

certain then as i am now of my ownexistence that in the accursed settlement there was no law save thatof the strongest that the living dead men had thrown behind them everycanon of the world which had

looked up and saw a head peering down intothe amphitheatrethe head of dunnoo my dogboy who attended to mycollies</s>  as soon as he had attracted my attention he held up his handand showed a rope</s>  i motioned staggering to and fro for the while thathe should throw it down</s>  it was a couple of leather punkahropes knottedtogether with a loop at one end</s>  i slipped the loop over my head

about</s>  we turned offbefore jagdallak because we heard the roads was good</s>  but they wasntgood enough for our two camelsmine and dravots</s>  when we left thecaravan dravot took off all his clothes and mine too and said we wouldbe heathen because the kafirs didnt allow mohammedans to talk to them</s> so we dressed betwixt and between and such a sight as daniel dravoti never saw yet nor expect to see again</s>  he burned half his beard andslung a sheepskin over his shoulder and shaved his head into patterns</s> he shaved mine too and made me wear outrageous things to look likea heathen</s>  that was in a most mountaineous country and our camelscouldnt go along any more because of the mountains</s>  they were tall andblack and coming home i saw them fight like wild goatsthere are lotsof goats in kafiristan</s>  and these mountains they never keep still nomore than the goats</s>  always fighting they are and dont let you sleepat night</s> take some more whisky i said very slowly</s>  what did you and danieldravot do when the camels could go no farther because of the rough roadsthat led into kafiristan</s>
what did which do</s>  there was a party called peachey taliaferro carnehanthat was with dravot</s>  shall i tell you about him</s>  he died out there inthe cold</s>  slap from the bridge fell old peachey turning and twisting inthe air like a penny whirligig that you can sell to the amir</s>  no theywas two for three hapence those whirligigs or i am much mistaken andwoeful sore</s> </s> </s> </s>  and then these camels were no use and peachey said todravot for the lords sake lets get out of this before our headsare chopped off and with that they killed the camels all among themountains not having anything in particular to eat but first they tookoff the boxes with the guns and the ammunition till two men came alongdriving four mules</s>  dravot up and dances in front of them singingsell me four mules</s>  says the first man if you are rich enough tobuy you are rich enough to rob but before ever he could put his handto his knife dravot breaks his neck over his knee and the other partyruns away</s>  so carnehan loaded the mules with the rifles that was takenoff the camels and together we starts forward into those bittercoldmountaineous parts and never a road broader than the back of yourhand</s> he paused for a moment while i asked him if he could remember thenature of the country through which he had journeyed</s> i am telling you as straight as i can but my head isnt as good as itmight be</s>  they drove nails through it to make me hear better how dravotdied</s>  the country was mountaineous and the mules were most contraryand the inhabitants was dispersed and solitary</s>  they went up and up anddown and down and that other party carnehan was imploring of dravotnot to sing and whistle so loud for fear of bringing down the tremenjusavalanches</s>  but dravot says that if a king couldnt sing it wasnt worthbeing king and whacked the mules over the rump and never took noheed for ten cold days</s>  we came to a big level valley all among themountains and the mules were near dead so we killed them not havinganything in special for them or us to eat</s>  we sat upon the boxes andplayed odd and even with the cartridges that was jolted out</s> then ten men with bows and arrows ran down that valley chasing twentymen with bows and arrows and the row was tremenjus</s>  they was fairmenfairer than you or mewith yellow hair and remarkable well built</s> says dravot unpacking the guns this is the beginning of the business</s> well fight for the ten men and with that he fires two rifles at thetwenty men and drops one of them at two hundred yards from the rockwhere he was sitting</s>  the other men began to run but carnehan anddravot sits on the boxes picking them off at all ranges up and down thevalley</s>  then we goes up to the ten men that had run across the snow tooand they fires a footy little arrow at us</s>  dravot he shoots above theirheads and they all falls down flat</s>  then he walks over them and kicksthem and then he lifts them up and shakes hands all round to make themfriendly like</s>  he calls them and gives them the boxes to carry andwaves his hand for all the world as though he was king already</s>  theytakes the boxes and him across the valley and up the hill into a pinewood on the top where there was half a dozen big stone idols</s>  dravothe goes to the biggesta fellow they call imbraand lays a rifle and acartridge at his feet rubbing his nose respectfully with his own nosepatting him on the head and nods his head and says thats all right</s> im in the know too and these old jimjams are my friends</s>  then heopens his mouth and points down it and when the first man brings himfood he says no and when the second man brings him food he saysno but when one of the old priests and the boss of the village bringshim food he says yes very haughty and eats it slow</s>  that was howwe came to our first village without any trouble just as though wehad tumbled from the skies</s>  but we tumbled from one of those damnedropebridges you see andyou couldnt expect a man to laugh muchafter that</s> take some more whisky and go on i said</s>  that was the first villageyou came into</s>  how did you get to be king</s> i wasnt king said carnehan</s>  dravot he was the king and a handsomeman he looked with the gold crown on his head and all</s>  him and the otherparty stayed in that village and every morning dravot sat by the sideof old imbra and the people came and worshipped</s>  that was dravotsorder</s>  then a lot of men came into the valley and carnehan dravot picksthem off with the rifles before they knew where they was and runs downinto the valley and up again the other side and finds another villagesame as the first one and the people all falls down flat on theirfaces and dravot says now what is the trouble between you twovillages</s>  and the people points to a woman as fair as you or me thatwas carried off and dravot takes her back to the first village andcounts up the deadeight there was</s>  for each dead man dravot poursa little milk on the ground and waves his arms like a whirligig andthats all right says he</s>  then he and carnehan takes the big boss ofeach village by the arm and walks them down the valley and shows themhow to scratch a line with a spear right down the valley and gives eacha sod of turf from both sides of the line</s>  then all the people comesdown and shouts like the devil and all and dravot says go and dig theland and be fruitful and multiply which they did though they didntunderstand</s>  then we asks the names of things in their lingobread andwater and fire and idols and such and dravot leads the priest of eachvillage up to the idol and says he must sit there and judge the peopleand if anything goes wrong he is to be shot</s> next week they was all turning up the land in the valley as quiet asbees and much prettier and the priests heard all the complaints andtold dravot in dumbshow what it was about</s>  thats just the beginningsays dravot</s>  they think were gods</s>  he and carnehan picks out twentygood men and shows them how to click off a rifle and form fours andadvance in line and they was very pleased to do so and clever to seethe hang of it</s>  then he takes out his pipe and his baccypouch andleaves one at one village and one at the other and off we two goes tosee what was to be done in the next valley</s>  that was all rock and therewas a little village there and carnehan says send em to the oldvalley to plant and takes em there and gives em some land thatwasnt took before</s>  they were a poor lot and we blooded em with a kidbefore letting em into the new kingdom</s>  that was to impress the peopleand then they settled down quiet and carnehan went back to dravot whohad got into another valley all snow and ice and most mountaineous</s> there was no people there and the army got afraid so dravot shootsone of them and goes on till he finds some people in a village and thearmy explains that unless the people wants to be killed they had betternot shoot their little matchlocks for they had matchlocks</s>  we makesfriends with the priest and i stays there alone with two of the armyteaching the men how to drill and a thundering big chief comes acrossthe snow with kettledrums and horns twanging because he heard there wasa new god kicking about</s>  carnehan sights for the brown of the men halfa mile across the snow and wings one of them</s>  then he sends a messageto the chief that unless he wished to be killed he must come and shakehands with me and leave his arms behind</s>  the chief comes alone firstand carnehan shakes hands with him and whirls his arms about same asdravot used and very much surprised that chief was and strokesmy eyebrows</s>  then carnehan goes alone to the chief and asks him indumbshow if he had an enemy he hated</s>  i have says the chief</s>  socarnehan weeds out the pick of his men and sets the two of the army toshow them drill and at the end of two weeks the men can manoeuvre aboutas well as volunteers</s>  so he marches with the chief to a great big plainon the top of a mountain and the chiefs men rushes into a village andtakes it we three martinis firing into the brown of the enemy</s>  so wetook that village too and i gives the chief a rag from my coat andsays occupy till i come which was scriptural</s>  by way of a reminderwhen me and the army was eighteen hundred yards away i drops a bulletnear him standing on the snow and all the people falls flat on theirfaces</s>  then i sends a letter to dravot wherever he be by land or bysea</s> at the risk of throwing the creature out of train i interrupted howcould you write a letter up yonder</s> the letter</s> oh</s> the letter</s>  keep looking at me between the eyesplease</s>  it was a stringtalk letter that wed learned the way of itfrom a blind beggar in the punjab</s> i remember that there had once come to the office a blind man witha knotted twig and a piece of string which he wound round the twigaccording to some cipher of his own</s>  he could after the lapse of daysor hours repeat the sentence which he had reeled up</s>  he had reduced thealphabet to eleven primitive sounds and tried to teach me his methodbut i could not understand</s> i sent that letter to dravot said carnehan and told him to comeback because this kingdom was growing too big for me to handle and theni struck for the first valley to see how the priests were working</s>  theycalled the village we took along with the chief bashkai and the firstvillage we took erheb</s>  the priests at erheb was doing all right butthey had a lot of pending cases about land to show me and some men fromanother village had been firing arrows at night</s>  i went out and lookedfor that village and fired four rounds at it from a thousand yards</s> that used all the cartridges i cared to spend and i waited for dravotwho had been away two or three months and i kept my people quiet</s> one morning i heard the devils own noise of drums and horns and dandravot marches down the hill with his army and a tail of hundreds ofmen and which was the most amazing a great gold crown on his head</s> my gord carnehan says daniel this is a tremenjus business andweve got the whole country as far as its worth having</s>  i am the sonof alexander by queen semiramis and youre my younger brother and agod too</s>  its the biggest thing weve ever seen</s>  ive been marching andfighting for six weeks with the army and every footy little village forfifty miles has come in

in mutton</s>  gold ive seen and turquoise ive kicked outof the cliffs and theres garnets in the sands of the river and heresa chunk of amber that a man brought me</s>  call up all the priests andhere take your crown</s> one of the men opens a black hair bag and i slips the crown on</s>  it wastoo small and too heavy but i wore it for the glory</s>  hammered gold itwasfive pounds weight like a hoop of a barrel</s> peachey says dravot we dont want to fight no more</s>  the craftsthe trick so help me</s>  and he brings forward that same chief that ileft at bashkaibilly fish we called him afterward

cant stopto inquire now or theyll turn against us</s>  ive forty chiefs at myheel and passed and raised according to their merit they shall be</s> billet these men on the villages and see that we run

my legs but i wasnt such a fool as not to see whata pull this craft business gave us</s>  i showed the priests families howto make aprons of the degrees but for dravots apron the blue borderand marks was made of turquoise lumps on white hide not cloth</s>  we tooka great square stone in the temple for the masters chair and littlestones for the officers chairs and painted the black pavement withwhite squares and did what we could to make things regular</s> at the levee which was held that night on the hillside with bigbonfires dravot gives out that him and me were gods and sons ofalexander and passed grand masters in the craft and was come to makekafiristan a country where every man should eat in peace and drink inquiet and specially obey us</s>  then the chiefs come round to shake handsand they were so hairy and white and fair it was just shaking hands withold friends</s>  we gave them names according as they was like men we hadknown in indiabilly fish holly dilworth

charley explained a little nervously that he had only come to theplace to look on and since looking on at games of skill is not a cheapamusement for the young i suggested that charlie should go back to hismother</s> that was our first step toward better acquaintance</s>  he would call onme sometimes in the evenings instead of running about london with hisfellowclerks and before long speaking of

death to the dropapennyintheslotjournals</s>  it was my fate to sit still while charlie read me poems ofmany hundred lines and bulky fragments of plays that would surelyshake the world</s>  my reward was his unreserved confidence and theselfrevelations and troubles of a young man are almost as holy as thoseof a maiden</s>  charlie had never fallen in love but was anxious to do soon the first

ofapology and description and swept on seeing all that he intended todo so clearly that he esteemed it already done and turned to me forapplause</s> i fancy that his mother did not encourage his aspirations and i knowthat his writingtable at home was the edge of his washstand</s>  this hetold me almost at the outset of our acquaintance when he was ravagingmy bookshelves and a little before i was implored to speak the truthas to his chances of writing something really great you know</s>  maybei encouraged him too much for one night he called on me his eyesflaming with excitement and said

could it be any other way</s>  now you listen to me</s>  the long oars onthe upper deck are managed by four men to each bench the lower onesby three and the lowest of all by two</s>  remember its

 i had my reasons for asking</s>  a man of my acquaintance hadonce gone down with a leaking ship in a still sea and had seen thewaterlevel pause for an instant ere it fell on the deck</s> it looked
