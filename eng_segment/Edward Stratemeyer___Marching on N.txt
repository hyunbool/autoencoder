 this was just previous to the breakingout of war between france and england and when the french and englishsettlers in america especially in those localities where trading withthe indians was profitable were bitter foes</s>  david becomes wellacquainted with washington while the latter is a surveyor and whenbraddock arrives in america and marches against fort duquesne the youngpioneer shoulders a musket and joins the virginia rangers under majorwashington to march forth and take part in braddocks bitter defeatand washingtons masterly effort to save the remnant of the army fromtotal annihilation</s> the defeat of the british forces left this section of the englishcolonies at the mercy of both the french and their savage indian alliesand for two years despite all that washington and other colonialleaders could do every isolated cabin and every small settlement westof winchester was in constant danger and numerous raids were madesavage and brutal in the extreme and these were

risley was telling me that he had heard the indians overat plum valley were as impudent as they could be</s>  he said half a dozenof em made a settler named hochstein give em all they wanted to eatand drink and when the german found fault they flourished theirtomahawks and told him all the settlers but the french were squaws andthat he had better shut up or theyd scalp him and burn down his

everything and that makesthem bold</s>  if i had my way id get colonel washington to raise an armyof three or four thousand menthe best frontiersmen to be foundandid chase every impudent frenchman out of the country</s>  we wont havepeace till that is done mark my words on it concluded henry morrisemphatically</s> david and henry morris were cousins living with their folks on aclearing not far from what was then known as wills creek now the townof cumberland virginia</s>  the two families consisted of dave and hisfather mr</s>  james morris who was a widower and mr</s>  joseph morris hiswife lucy and three children rodney the oldest who was something ofa cripple henry who has just been introduced and little nell thesunshine of the whole home</s> in a former volume of this series entitled with washington in thewest i related the particulars of how the two morris families settledat wills creek and how james morris after the loss of his wifewandered westward and established a tradingpost on the kinotah one ofthe numerous branches of the ohio river</s>  in the meantime dave his sonfell in with george washington when the future president was asurveyor and the youth helped to survey many tracts of land in thebeautiful shenandoah valley</s> at this time the colonies of england and of france in america werehaving a great deal of trouble between themselves and with the indians</s> briefly stated both england and france claimed all the territorydrained by the ohio and other nearby rivers and the french sought inevery possible way to drive out english traders who pushed westward</s> the driving out of the english traders soon brought trouble to jamesmorris and after being attacked by a band of indians he was servedwith a notice from the french to quit his tradingpost in three monthstime or less</s>  unwilling to give up a profitable business and halfsuspecting that the notice was the concoction of a rascally frenchtrader named jean bevoir and not an official document mr</s>  morris sentdave back to winchester that they might get the advice of colonelwashington and other officials as to what was best to do</s> when dave arrived home he found that there was practically a state ofwar between the french and english</s>  washington was preparing to marchagainst the enemy and to get back to the trading post unaided was forthe youth out of the question</s>  such being the case dave joined thevirginia rangers under washington and with him went his cousin henryand both fought bravely at the defense of fort necessity where henrywas badly wounded</s> the defeat of the english at fort necessity was followed by bitter newsfor the morrises</s>  sam barringford a wellknown old trapper of thatlocality and a great friend to the boys came in one day badly used upand with the information that the tradingpost had fallen under thecombined attack of some french led by jean bevoir and some indians ledby a rascal named fox head who was bevoirs tool</s>  james morris hadbeen taken prisoner and what had become of the trader barringford couldnot tell</s> poor dave cut to the heart was for looking for his father at once andhis relatives and sam barringford were equally eager</s>  but thetradingpost was miles awaythrough the dense forest and over the wildmountainsand the territory was now in the hands of the enemy</s>  undersuch circumstances all had to wait throughout the severe winter andfollowing spring a time that to the boy seemed an age</s> general braddock had been sent over from england to take charge ofaffairs against the french and soon an expedition was organized havingfor its object the reduction of fort duquesne which was built where thecity of pittsburg now stands</s>  the expedition was composed of englishgrenadiers brought over by braddock and several hundred virginiarangers under washington</s>  with the rangers were dave and barringford</s> henry wished to go but was still too weak and it was felt that josephmorris could not be spared from the homestead</s> braddocks bitter defeat in the vicinity of fort duquesne came as agreat shock to all of the english colonies and it was only by colonelwashingtons tact and gallantry and the bravery of the rangers underhim that the retreating army was saved from total annihilation orcapture</s>  during this battle dave was shot and captured but his enemiessoon after abandoned him in the woods and while wandering around moredead than alive he fell in with white buffalo a friendly indian chiefand later on with barringford and with his father who had been aprisoner of the french since the fall of the trading post</s> the homecoming of dave and his father was viewed with greatsatisfaction by joseph morris and his family who did all in their powerto make the two sufferers comfortable</s>  from mr</s>  morris it was learnedthat the pelts stored at the trading post had been saved through thekindness of another english trader so that the frenchman jean bevoirand his indian tool fox head had not gained much by the raid</s> i am certain that the raid was not the work of the french authoritiessaid james morris</s>  but now the war is on they will of course stand upfor everything jean bevoir and his followers have done</s>  nevertheless ihold to it that the trading post and the land staked out around it ismine and some day i shall lay claim to it</s> right you are brother came from joseph morris</s>  and so far as i amable i will stand by you in the claim</s>  but i am fearful that matterswill be much worse before they are better</s> oh theres no doubt of that</s>  this victory will make the french thinkthey can walk right over us</s> yes and it will do more put in rodney who was now a young man inyears</s>  many indians have been wavering between taking sides with us orthe enemy</s>  now many of these will stake fortunes with thevictorsthats the usual way</s>  he stretched himself on his chair andgave a sigh</s>  i wish i was a little stronger id join the army andfight em</s> we havent any army to speak of now resumed james morris</s>  when i waslast down at winchester colonel washington had but a handful ofsoldiersall the rest having gone home to attend to their farms andplantationsand over at wills creek fort it was no better</s>  the payoffered to the soldiers is so poor nobody cares to stay in the ranks</s>
its not such a lack of patriotism said joseph morris</s>  none of ourhome soldiers liked the ways of the troops from england and it madethem mad to have their officers pushed down and braddocks underlingspushed up</s>  even washington had to remonstrate although they tell me hewas willing to fight no matter what position they gave him</s>  and mattersare going no better in the north</s>  either england and our colonies mustwake up or ere we know it all will be lost to the french and theirindian allies</s> what of the indians</s>  put in mrs</s>  morris</s>  have those under whitebuffalo gone over to the french</s> white buffalos braves have not answered her husband</s>  but the tribeis badly split up and white buffalo himself is nearly crazy over thematter</s>  he says some of the old chiefs swear by the french while theyounger warriors all cling to washington</s>  white buffalo says that hehimself will never lift a tomahawk against the englishand i feelcertain he means it</s> white buffalo is a real nice indian came from little nell who sat onthe doorstep playing</s>  didnt he make me this doll</s>  if they were all asgood as he is i wouldnt be afraid a bit</s>  and she hugged to her breastthe crude wooden figure the heap big pappoose with which whitebuffalo had gained her childish confidence</s> nor would i be afraid came from mrs</s>  morris</s>  but all indians are notas kind and true as white buffalo and if they should ever go on thewarpath and move this way she did not finish but shook her headsadly</s> if they should come this way we will do our best to fight them offsaid james morris</s>  but let us hope it will never come to that</s>  thebutchery at the trading post was enough i should not wish to see suchdoings around our homestead</s> chapter iideer and indiansdave and henry had left home an hour before hoping to bring back withthem at least one deer if not two</s>  henry was a great hunter havingbrought down many a bird on the wing and squirrel on the run and heknew that if he could only get a fair sight at a deer the game would behis</s>  as old readers know dave was likewise a good shot so it waslikely that the youths would bring back something if any game showeditself</s> it was a cool clear day with just a touch of snow on the ground idealweather for hunting and as the boys pushed on each felt in excellentspirits despite the talk about the indians</s>  so far as they knew therewas no indian settlement within miles of them nor were there anywandering redskins within half a days journey</s> hullo there go half a dozen rabbits</s>  cried dave presently andpointed through a little clearing to their left</s> dont shoot</s>  cried his cousin although dave had not raised hisflintlock musket</s>  if you do youll scare the deer sureif they arewithin hearing</s> i wasnt going to shoot henry</s>  but just look at the beggars sittingup and looking at us</s>  i reckon they know they are safe</s> since the fighting with the french there hasnt been much huntingthrough here and so the game is quite tame</s>  but they wont sitlongthere they go now</s>  come</s> the pair resumed their journey through the forest henry leading theway for he had been over this trail several times before</s>  birds werenumerous and they could have filled their canvas bag with ease hadthey felt inclined</s>  but the minds of both were on the deer and to henryat least it was such game or nothing although dave might have contentedhimself with something smaller</s>  yet both knew that mrs</s>  morris wouldlook forward with pleasure to getting some fresh venison for her table</s> at length the pair reached the lower creek which henry had mentioned</s> here the stream which flowed past the morris homestead split intoseveral arms one flowing through a wide clearing and the othersentering the forest and passing around a series of rough rocks and acliff nearly fifty feet high</s>  at this point the forest had never yetfelt the weight of the white mans axe and trees had stood there untilbrought low by storm or the weight of years</s> go slow now whispered henry as he caught his cousin by the arm</s>  ifthey hear us the game is up</s> the wind is with us returned dave</s>  nevertheless he slowed up asdesired and then the pair moved forward with extreme caution eachhaving seen to it that his firearm was ready for immediate use</s> suddenly henry came to a halt and dropped almost flat behind a rock anddave instantly followed</s>  coming around a short turn they had caughtsight of four deer standing hoofdeep in the water drinking</s>  all theheads were down but as the youths looked in the direction that of anold buck came up with a jerk and he sniffed the air suspiciously</s> take the nearest whispered henry softly and quickly</s>  ready</s>
there was a second of silence and then the two guns spoke as one piecethe reports echoing and reechoing throughout the mighty forest andalong the cliff</s>  the deer henry had aimed at fell down in the waterplunging wildly in its dying agonies while that struck by dave hobbledpainfully up the bank</s>  the others including the old buck turned andsped off with the swiftness of the wind</s> huzza</s>  we have em</s>  shouted henry</s>  come on</s>  and he leaped to hisfeet with dave beside him</s>  not far off a dead tree lay across the streamand they quickly climbed this so as not to get their feet wet</s>  whenthey gained the spot where the deer had been drinking they found henrysquarry quite dead</s>  the deer dave had hit was thrashing around in somebrushwood</s> i reckon hell want another shot said dave and reloaded his firearmwith all speed</s>  then he primed up and approached the deer but before hecould pull trigger henry stopped him</s> he dont need it came from the older youth</s>  save your powder andball</s>  ill fix him</s> giving his gun to dave henry rushed up behind the deer at the sametime drawing the long hunting knife he had lately gotten into the habitof carrying</s>  watching his chance he plunged the knife into the deersthroat</s>  the stroke went true and soon the beast had breathed its last</s> good for you cried dave enthusiastically</s>  no use in talking henryyou were cut out for a hunter</s>  youll be as good as sam barringford ifyou keep on</s> oh you did about as well as i did dave was the modest rejoinder</s> but this is a prime haul no use of talking</s>  mother will be tickled todeath</s> i reckon well all be pleasedwe havent had deer meat for some time</s> but were going to have some work getting these two carcasses home</s>  nouse of trying to get those other deer is there</s> use</s>  not much</s>  why that old buck must be about two or three miles awayby this time</s>  say he was a big fellow wasnt he</s>  i should like to havehad those horns but i knew there was no use in fetching him downhismeat would be too tough and strong</s> i fancy the best we can do is to make a drag for each deer and eachpull his own load home went on dave</s>  if we leave one here the wolvesand foxes will soon finish the meat</s> yes thats the only way</s>  and we might as well hurry for it is gettinglate and it will take us a good three hours to get back with suchloads</s> they were soon at work henry with his hunting knife and dave with hispocket blade cutting down some long pliable brushwood which would makeexcellent drags for both loads</s>  their good luck put each in good humorand as he worked dave could not refrain from whistling his favoriteairs being as of old lucy locket lost her pocket and the pirateslady o</s> the brushwood cut they lost no time in binding their loads fast andthen henry led the way along the watercourse without crossing to thetrail they had previously pursued</s> its almost as near this way as the other he said</s>  and i reckon itwill be a bit easier pulling</s> well make it as easy as you can henry</s>  its no light load i can tellyou that</s>  sam barringford was once telling me how he dragged three deerfrom plum valley to risleys new place over the snow</s>  i dont see howhe did it</s> oh its easy when the crust of the snow is hard enoughthe drag goeslike a sled</s>  but i admit sam is a wonderfully powerful man</s> indeed he is</s>  why it was a sight to seethe way he fought when redfox and his followers attacked the trading post</s>  he was a whole host inhimself</s> inside of quarter of an hour they had reached a bend in the stream andnow henry left the watercourse and pushed on over a low hill backed upby a series of rocks</s> it will be a slight pull up hill he said</s>  but it will save us nearlyhalf a mile</s>  we can rest a few minutes when we get to the top</s>  when weget up there ill show you the spot where i saw those four bears threeyears ago</s> dont know as i want to meet four bears just now</s> oh the spot isnt on this hillits on the hill to the left</s>  powwowhill sam barringford called it</s>  he said it used to be a great indianresort when the miamies were in this neighborhood</s>  but the redskins fromshunrum came and drove em out</s> the top of the rise gained dave was glad enough to rest and both satdown on the trunk of a fallen monarch of the forest the home now ofsome chipmunks that fled quickly at their approach</s> there is the spot where i saw the bears said henry pointing with hishand to a clump of trees on the next hill quite a distance away</s>  theywere in a bunch under thathullo</s>
 he broke offshort</s>  down behind the tree dave</s>  quick</s> the sudden note of alarm was not lost on dave and in a twinkle both theyoung hunters were crouched behind the fallen tree</s>  dave caught his gunand placed his hand on the trigger but henry shoved the barrel of thepiece downward</s> what did you see</s>  came from the younger of the youths</s> indians</s>  was the short reply</s>  henry peeped carefully forth</s>  yes sirindians just as sure as you are born</s>  look for yourself</s> by the king but youre right</s>  exclaimed dave in excitement</s>  twothreei see four of them</s> i think i saw a fifthbehind that rock to the right</s>  yes there heis</s> can you make out what they are</s> no excepting that they are none of white buffalos tribe</s> if they dont belong in this neighborhood they are here for no goodsaid dave decidedly</s> i agree with you there dave</s>  possibly they are on a hunt</s>  but whyshould they come here when there is better game further west</s> if they are on a hunt its not for wild animals came from davesignificantly</s>  have they got their war paint on</s> i cant see them clearly enough for that</s> for several minutes both youths remained silent watching the distantindians as they moved around</s>  they had evidently killed some wildanimal although what it was the watchers could not make out</s> if they shot anything it must have been before we reached thisneighborhood said henry presently</s>  i heard no reports</s> nor i</s>  but never mind that</s>  what shall we do</s> i dont know excepting to go home with our game and report them</s>  idont care to let them see us do you</s> not if they are enemies and i reckon they are</s> do you suppose they spotted us</s> i think notalthough you can never tell they are that cute</s>  they mayhave a spy working his way over here at this very minute</s> then let us go on without delay</s> it was easy to say this but how to proceed without being noticed was aproblem</s>  henrys deer lay behind the fallen tree but daves was infront and the younger hunter did not wish to leave his game behind him</s> im going to risk it said dave and crawling cautiously around thestumpend of the fallen tree he reached forth and caught one of the endsof the drag</s>  but the task was a difficult one and as he pulled the deerslipped to the ground and the end of the tree branch was suddenly raisedhigh in the air</s> drop it cried henry and dave did so</s>  they must have seen thatdave</s>  see two of them are looking this way</s>  we had better clear out andbe quick about it</s> im going to have that deer returned the younger hunter and catchingthe game by the hind legs he dragged it behind the tree</s>  then both boyshurried down the opposite side of the hill with all speed</s>  here theyplaced both deer on the single drag and continued on their way homewardwith all possible speed</s> chapter iiidiscovery and pursuitit must be confessed that both youths were thoroughly alarmed and withgood reason</s>  since braddocks defeat they had heard of the uprising ofthe indians at nancoke lushers run willowbury and several othersmall settlements and had heard of the murder of several germanfamilies twentyfive miles to the north of wills creek fort and themurder of lee cass and his wife and four children thirty miles downthe valley</s>  the outbreaks had not resulted from any united efforts onthe indians part but there was no telling how soon the different tribeswould dig up the war hatchet and descend upon all the frontiersettlements in force and simultaneously</s> from the top of the hill henry had expected to go straight home butthis course would necessitate the crossing of a clearing quarter of amile in extent and such a path he now deemed unwise to take</s> if they are following us it will be dead easy for them to spot us inthe open he said</s>  we had better stick to the forest</s>  of course theycan follow the trail of the drag easily enough but i hate to think ofgiving up so much meatafter we had such a journey to bring it down</s> dont lets give it up yet pleaded dave</s>  the deer was the largest hehad yet laid low and he was correspondingly proud of the showing</s> perhaps they arent after us at all</s> on they went traveling as fast as their somewhat tired limbs permitted</s> there was another rise to cross beyond which was a watercourse leadingdown to the rear of their homestead</s> i think i know where there is a rough raft to be found said henry</s> and if i can find it we can place the deer on that and tow them home</s> we may get wet but it will be easy work and we can make quicker timethan over the ground</s> right you are henry and remember water leaves no trail respondeddave</s> they were soon at the side of the stream which at this point wasseveral feet deep and five to ten yards wide</s>  the banks were thicklyoverhung with bushes now however bare of leaves</s>  at one spot was aninlet and here henry pointed out the raft he had mentioned a crudeaffair of four short logs lashed together with willow withes</s> we can pull that with ease said dave as he surveyed the affair</s> come let us dump the deer aboard at once</s>  we can wade along the bankand</s> he broke off short and clutched his cousins arm</s>  his glance had strayedup the stream to a bend several rods away and there he had seen the prowof an indian canoe and the headgear of several painted warriors</s> by ginger</s>  more indians</s>  ejaculated henry and both dropped flat ontop of their dead game</s>  how many did you see dave</s> three or fourand there are several more</s> yes and they are in their warpaint</s>  dave do you know what i think</s> that they are on the warpath</s>  oh henry if that is so</s>  dave didnot finish but looked anxiously at his cousin</s> if that is so it means that every homestead for miles around is indanger</s>  and we havent a single soldier within fifty miles</s>  added theolder youth with almost a groan</s> all the while they were talking they kept their eyes on the indians andthey now saw the redmen come out on the stream and cross to the sidethey occupied</s>  then of a sudden the warriors sent up a shout calculatedto strike terror to their hearts</s> they have discovered us</s>  they are after us</s>  burst from daves lips</s> what shall we do</s> weve got to run for it was henrys answer</s>  hurry up before itstoo late</s> but the deer</s> well have to let them go</s>  come</s> side by side they darted into the forest back of the watercourse andmade their way with all possible speed between bushes trees and rocks</s> there was no trail and neither knew exactly where he was going</s>  oncedave tripped on some roots and pitched headlong but he picked himselfup in a hurry and panting for breath kept on as before</s> the retreat of the two young hunters came none too quick for scarcelyhad they reached the shelter of the wood when several of the indians letfly with their arrows one of which almost clipped henrys shoulder</s> this fixed the situation beyond all dispute</s> they are on the warpath or they wouldnt fire on us said dave</s>  areyou winged</s> no but it was a pretty close aim</s>  who can they be</s> i believe they are some of fox heads dirty band</s>  if they catch us ibelieve theyll kill us</s> or keep us to torture answered the older youth</s>  but they are notgoing to catch us if i can help itand i think i can</s> while the two were talking they sped on and on deeper and deeper intothe forest</s>  both wished to turn in the direction of home but did notdare do so fearing the indians would be waiting to head them off</s> at the start the shouts of their pursuers had sounded unpleasantly closebut now they died out utterly</s>  but whether the redskins had given up thechase or were coming on in silence they could not tell</s> i dont think theyll give up so quick was henrys comment as theypaused a few seconds to get their breath</s>  i reckon theyve found itdoesnt pay to yell</s>  we may get another volley of arrows before we knowit</s> once more they went on</s>  their course was now in a wide semicirclecalculated to bring them up in the clearing on the east side of theirhomestead</s> well pass uriah risleys new cabin said dave</s>  it is our duty towarn him of this danger</s>  he isnt much of an indian hunter and if theredskins come here he and his wife will be at their mercy</s> uriah risley was an englishman who had settled in the vicinity with hiswife several years before</s>  when dave was once on a trip to annapoliswith his uncle the two had stopped at risleys home and been agreeablyentertained</s>  since that time the englishman having grown moreaccustomed to pioneer life had moved further westward and built himselfa cabin twice as large as that previously occupied</s>  but though the manwas a good farmer and wood cutter he was a poor marksman and hunterand both he and his wife lived in dread of large wild animals andunfriendly indians</s> as said before night was coming on and under the lofty trees it wasdark</s>  they had now to pick their way with care for fear of falling intosome dangerous hole</s>  half a mile more was covered when henry called ahalt</s>  dave was glad of this for he had stepped on a loose stone but amoment before and given his ankle a nasty twist</s> im wondering which is the most direct road to risleys said theolder youth</s> i believe that is the direction answered dave pointing with hishand</s> i reckon you are right dave</s>  and how far do you calculate we are fromhis cabin</s> the best part of a mile</s> i agree again</s>  let us take a direct course</s>  the indians must be far tothe rearif they havent given up the chase altogether</s> a few minutes later they were again tearing their way through theforest the growth being here so thick they could scarcely pass</s> overhead a slight breeze was blowing but they felt little of this</s>  farto the westward the sun was slowly sinking behind the mountains castinglong shadows across the treetops</s>  here and there the night birds weretuning up but otherwise all was as quiet as a graveyard</s> the coming of night and the gravity of their situation made the boysthoughtful and for a long while not a word was spoken</s>  henry wasthinking of his parents and his sister and brother and wondering ifthey were yet in peril while daves thoughts turned to his father whohad said that morning that he intended to go to wills creek fort onbusiness</s>  was his parent at the fort and would the soldiers there getnews of the coming indian raid</s> both of the young hunters were thus deep in thought when henry espied alight directly in front of them</s>  they had just come over a rise ofground and found the light in a hollow between several rocks</s>  it was anindian encampment and around the blaze were seated fully a score ofwarriors smoking their long pipes and listening to the speech beingmade by a tall chief who stood in their midst</s> more indians</s>  muttered henry and threw himself flat</s>  theneighborhood seems to be full of them</s>  dave this means an awfuluprising</s>  we must get back as fast as we can and warn everybody</s> i have seen some of those indians before whispered the younger youth</s> they were in the band that attacked the trading post while father cameon here</s>  they belong to fox heads band and i believe that is fox headhimself addressing them for he had a foxs head trailing over hisshoulder and a fox brush among his head feathers</s>  id like to shoot himwhere he stands</s>  he deserves itfor all he has done to injure us</s>  anddave gave his gun a sudden tight clutch which was very suggestive</s> no</s>  no</s>  interposed his cousin</s>  if you dropped him the whole packwould be on us like so many wolves</s>  the only thing we can do is to getaway and give warning</s>  let us crawl back to the other side of the riseand go around</s> without delay they started to do as henry had advised</s>  it was no easymatter for the brushwood was thick and the rocks sharp and uneven</s>  theyhad not gone a distance of fifty feet when henry struck a loose stoneand sent it bumping down over a dozen others</s> instantly half a dozen indians leaped to their feet and the speech ofthe leading indian came to a sudden end</s> the game is up</s>  cried dave</s>  let us run</s>  and run they did as fast asthe darkness and the nature of the ground would permit</s>  the indians cameafter them calling on them to halt and then sending forth severalarrows and a gunshot none of which however took effect</s> we are in for it now</s>  panted dave as they came to a halt in a smallclearing hedged in on all sides by rocks and dense thickets</s>  im surei dont know how to turn do you</s> if it comes to the worst we can take a stand against these rocksanswered his cousin grimly</s>  but come i think i see an opening</s> he moved over to the rocks and stepped cautiously into the darkness</s> there was an opening they had not noticed before a crevice several feetwide and both deep and long</s>  into this he squeezed and dave came afterhim</s>  they pushed forward among the dead vines leaves and rubbish for adistance of thirty feet and then halted in what would have been a smallcave had it not been for the slit of an opening at the top</s>  with batedbreath they waited while their pursuers gradually grew closer</s> chapter ivburning of the cabinit was not long before the two young hunters heard the indians quiteplainly</s>  evidently the redmen did not deem it necessary to advance withmore than ordinary caution for they conversed with each other in a lowtone to which dave and henry listened with interest although theycould understand little of what was said</s> presently one warrior took up a position in front of the crevice and notover five yards from where the youths lay concealed</s>  evidently he waslistening for some sound from them and they hardly dared to breathe</s>  asmight be expected dave at that instant felt a strong inclination tosneeze but he suppressed the desire although almost bursting a bloodvessel in consequence</s> soon another indian came up and then a third</s>  a talk lasting severalminutes followed and one warrior started to light a torch</s>  but theothers stopped this fearing it might draw the fire of the whites</s>  thenone redman shifted to the right another to the left while a thirdcrawled up over the rocks and through the bushes growing

telling whenthey will be back</s>  still i reckon we had better get out of here</s> i agree</s>  but we cant take the course we were following</s>  i think thebest we can do is to turn further to the left and strike risleys fromthe west added henry</s> dave was willing and as cautiously as possible they climbed back out ofthe crevice the way they had come</s>  just as dave was about to step intothe clearing a sudden whirr of noise caused him to jerk back</s> whats that</s>  came quickly from his cousin</s> some wild animal was the answer after a pause</s> did it attack you</s> no but it came pretty close</s>  i thought first it was an indian leapingup out of the grass</s> they moved off side by side and each with his gun ready for use</s>  ashenry was the hunter of the morris family and knew the forest betterthan anyone dave allowed him to do such guiding as seemed necessary</s> they pursued their course over one rise and then another and after thatfollowed the windings of a tiny brook which henry said ran to withingunshot of the risley homestead</s> they were just making a bend of the watercourse when another wild animalstarted up directly under henrys feet</s>  it was a fox resting in a hollowlog and in its anxiety to get away the animal struck against daveslegs upsetting him</s> oh</s>  cried dave as he went down</s>  help</s>  shoot him</s> its a fox</s>  ejaculated henry and as the animal shot past him he madea dive and caught the beast by the brush</s>  the fox gave a snarl and triedto bite him but ere the head came around the young hunter swung the foxin a circle and brought him down with a dull thud on the log</s>  the firstblow was followed by another which crushed the beasts skull as thoughit were an eggshell</s> there</s>  hell never bother anybody again said henry as he threw thebeast down</s>  wish i had time to skin him</s>  but we had better not lose aminute</s> henry youre a wonder of a hunter</s>  burst out dave</s>  i dont believe icould have done that</s>  it was much better than shooting him for it savedpowder and saved making a noise too</s> sam barringford taught me that trickalthough not on a fox</s>  i once sawhim hammer the life out of a limping wolf that way and he often catchesup snakes by the tail and snaps their heads off whip fashion</s> leaving the fox where it had fallen they continued on their way alongthe stream

blaze apparently and in the directionwhere stood risleys cabin</s> can that be an indian campfire</s>  went on the younger hunter</s> i dont think so dave</s>  its worse than that</s> worse</s>  oh henry do you think it is risleys cabin that is burning</s> just what i do think</s>  see the flame is growing brighter</s>  either itsthe cabin or that cattle shed he has been building</s>  come on well soonknow</s> henry now set off on a run through the timber picking the way with allthe skill of an old frontiersman</s>  dave kept close behind his cousin</s>  asthey advanced they saw the fire more plainly and beheld it spread outand mount further skyward</s>  it was uriah risleys cabin beyond a doubtand now the new cattle shed had caught and was also being consumed bythe devouring

warpath</s> while he was speaking a gunshot sounded out coming from a greatdistance</s>  another report followed and then all became as silent asbefore</s> that must be risley or somebody else fighting the indians off saiddave</s>  well have to be careful or well run into a trap</s> keep in the timber answered henry</s>  for all we know there may be ahundred redskins in this vicinity</s>  hark</s>  they are around the cabin sureenough</s> they listened and amid the crackling of the flames they now heard thewhooping and yelling of a score of indians while the flickering glareshowed to them the dusky forms moving in one direction and another</s>  someof the indians had found a demijohn of liquor belonging to theenglishman and were gulping this down in great glee while othersparaded

indianscome for us we had better run without stopping to fireunless ofcourse they get too close added henry</s> once again he led the way slowly and cautiously flitting from one treeto another in absolute silence</s>  the fire was now at its height lightingup the sky for a long distance around</s>  the sparks were blowing in theirdirection but the light fall of snow had wet the trees and brushwoodso no harm was done</s> presently they found themselves again close to the brook which at thispoint crossed a garden patch that uriah risley had gotten into shape theseason before</s>  at the side of the brook was a roughly constructedmilkhouse made of large stones for walls and untrimmed timbers for aroof</s>  behind this the boys crouched to take another view of what wasgoing on in the

furniture had been hauled forth a chest ofdrawers and a bureau and now some of the redmen set to work to breakopen both articles to see what they contained</s> they are after everything of value they can lay hands on muttereddave</s>  what a shame</s>  do you see anything of</s> the young hunter broke off short for at that instant came a low moan ofpain from the interior of the milkhouse</s> are

i pretended to go into the house andhide and when they came in i leaped through a back window and ran forthis place</s>  i got into the water up to my shoulders and pulled a bit ofa board over my head

wentinside</s>  the board was quickly raised and they helped mrs</s>  risley fromthe watery hole in which she had been squatting with her chin resting onher knees</s>  she was so chilled and stiff and

 i am sorry i cant give you something toput over your dress but i havent anything</s>  before you put on thejacket let me bind up that arrow wound</s> there was now no time to stand upon ceremony and she allowed him todress the wound with all the skill he could muster dave in the meantimekeeping watch that the indians might not surprise them</s>  fortunatelyhenry having suffered similarly himself

east was besetwith sharp stakes while its companion was being used for cookingpurposes</s> around both campfires were fully thirty indians all more thanordinarily hideous in their daubs of red blue and yellow war paintand their crowns of colored feathers and strings of animals teeth andhuman scalps</s>  the redmen had been marching around the campfires but nowthey halted and all sank crosslegged upon the soil</s> suddenly after a second of silence one indian tall and straightleaped to his feet and holding his arms out at full length before himbegan to rock his body from side to side</s>  then he ran for one of thefires and pulling a sharp stick from its place in the ground smote theburning end on his breast</s> this is the fear spotted wolf has for the english he cried in hisnative

with care and once back into thetimber commenced to run with his gun slung over his shoulder and hishands held out before him to keep from running afoul of anyobstruction</s>  more than once he bumped into a tree or fell sprawling oversome exposed roots knocking the wind out of him</s>  but he always pickedhimself up and went on again with undiminished speed</s>  indeed the nearerhe got to home the

 dave ran to meet the englishman</s>  tell me quickly is everythingall right over to our house</s> it was all right when i left an hour or so ago lad</s>  but your unclehad been talking to hans lomann

from the cabin and a moment laterthey heard him ride away at the best speed his steed could attain</s> there was now a great confusion in the cabin</s>  knowing that she mustreally leave mrs</s>  morris set to work to gather her most precious thingsinto several bundles which might be carried on horseback</s>  as well as hewas able rodney helped her and little nell also took a hand bound tosave

son</s>  we must trust to luck and our skill toevade them</s> it was not long before a red glare appeared in the sky in the directionwhere the cabin was located</s>  all knew what that meant but nobody said aword for fear of breaking down</s>  but joseph morris gritted his teeth ina fashion which showed only too plainly what was passing in his mind</s> given the chance and he would make the indians pay dearly for thedestruction of his property</s> suddenly dave drew rein and up went his gun aimed at a figure standingunder a tree ahead</s>  but the figure put up an arm and waved it

through the forest was resumedsome of the indians going ahead and others including white buffalobringing up the rear to keep back the advance of any who might befollowing from the burning cabin</s> they were still two miles from the fort when some of the indians in thefront sounded a note of warning</s>  but this was not needed for a minutelater they fell in with a neighbor also bound for the fort</s>  thisneighbor had with him his two sons two daughters and his sick wifewhom they were carrying on a litter</s> no injuns around here as yet said the neighbor whose name waslarkwell</s>  but they are coming jest as fast as they can</s>  we cant git tothe fort none too soon</s> chapter ixgathering at fort lawrencefort lawrence was little more than a fort in name only</s>  it was a spotselected by the morrises and others living within a radius of one totwentytwo miles where they might congregate for safety at any timewhen the way to wills creek or winchester should be cut off</s> the fort was located at a point where two small streams joined</s>  here thebrushwood and trees had been cleared off for a distance of little overan acre</s>  some trees running in a semicircle from one brook to theother had been left standing and between these a rude stockade hadbeen planted of logs ten to twelve feet high and sharppointed at thetop</s>  along the two watercourses were a series of rough rocks and on topof these other rocks had been placed making a barrier almost as high asthe wooden one opposite</s>  in the wooden stockade and among the rocksport holes were placed so that those inside could command every avenueof approach with their firearms</s>  to the whole there was a rude gatewaybut as yet no gate further than some heavy brushwood piled convenientlynearthornbrush which all indians despised</s> so far there had assembled at the fort six families consisting of eightmen and seven women with fifteen children of all ages from boys andgirls of daves growth to an infant in arms</s>  these pioneers had broughtwith them all the earthly possessions which they or their beasts ofburden could carry and these goods were now piled high in the center ofthe stockade where there was something of a hollow among the rocks</s> back of this pile was a second hollow rudely thatched with treebranches and here the women and the smaller children assembled thelittle ones either sleeping soundly or crying shrilly for the comfortsto which they were accustomed</s> among the men was captain john smith tanner a virginian of mixedenglish and german blood</s>  captain tanner had fought under washington atbraddocks defeat and also done good work during several indianuprisings and this had won for him the military title which howeverwas not of the kings troops but of the local militia</s>  the captain wasan outandout backwoodsman a bachelor and a man wellliked by nearlyall who knew him</s> as we know it was captain tanner who had sent the note to josephmorriss house by white buffalo and now he and several others of thesettlers waited anxiously for the appearance of not alone these friendsbut of five other pioneers including uriah risley</s>  eight men to defendboth the stockade and the rocks were not many and the captain felt thatshould the enemy appear in force matters would speedily reach a crisiswith the whites</s> somebuddy comin</s>  shouted one of the watchers presently</s>  an injun</s> can you make him out</s>  questioned the captain but before the questionwas fairly finished the watcher continuedits white buffalo and some white folks with him</s> in a moment more the morrises and larkwells came into view and thethornbrush was pulled aside to allow them to enter the enclosure</s>  theparty rode in one at a time joseph morris being the last to enter</s> rodney was so tired and exhausted he could not stand and dave led him toa seat on a tree stump and then assisted his aunt and little nell toalight</s> oh dear</s>  where are we</s>  cried the little girl who had just awakened</s> i thought i was home in bed</s> you are safe with mamma dear answered mrs</s>  morris hugging hertightly</s>  we have come to the fort to get away from the wicked indians</s> and i was asleep all the time</s>  how funny</s>  little nell stared aroundher</s>  oh there is mary lee and martha brownley</s>  she ejaculated</s>  illhave company wont i</s> yes answered her mother and they joined their neighborsif thoseliving miles away could be called such</s> the woman on the litter cared for all the men folks which includedseveral who were little more than boys assembled to map out a plan ofaction and decide what should be done with white buffalo and hiswarriors</s>  the indian chief was willing to aid them as much as was in hispower but did not wish to enter the stockade preferring to fight fromthe shelter of the forest beyond</s> it is the redmans way said white buffalo even as it is the way ofthe wildcat to fight in the darkness</s>  white buffalo can do more from theoutside than from the inside of the fort</s> i reckon youre right injun answered captain tanner</s>  but now youvecarried one message for us i rather wish youd carry another</s> white buffalo will do what is best for his white brethren</s> id like to send word to winchester to colonel washington letting himknow just how were fixed here</s>  the captain turned to those around him</s> isnt that a good plan</s> it is said one but these indians may give us lots of helpif theenemy come on us in heavy numbers</s>  they oughtnt all to go</s> the matter was talked over and at last it was decided to let whitebuffalo start for winchester with two of his braves leaving the otherredmen to scatter through the woods and give the alarm on the approachof the enemy</s>  a letter was hastily written to washington and whitebuffalo started off just as the first streaks of dawn were beginning toappear in the east</s> fortunately for those present some of the pioneers had brought withthem large stocks of provision so there was no need for anybody to gohungry for a long while to come should the indians lay siege to them</s> water could also be had in plenty which was desirable both for drinkingpurposes and in case of fire</s> with the coming of day those in the fort breathed more freely for theyknew that even if the enemy came up it was not likely they would beginan attack until darkness once again settled down</s>  in the meantime thework of strengthening the defense went on steadily a laborer onlyquitting when he found it necessary to lie down for a few hours sleep</s> the indians had gone out the thornbrush had been piled high in thegateway and for the time being there seemed nothing for the pioneers todo but to sit down and await developments</s>  several campfires wereburning and over these a morning meal was cooked to which all but oneor two invalids did ample justice</s>  the assemblage divided itself intohalf a dozen groups each talking in a low tone of the prospects</s> the morrises were chiefly concerned over the fate of henry</s>  when shethought of her boy perhaps murdered and scalped the bitter tears ofanguish rolled down mrs</s>  morriss cheeks and the little the otherscould do to cheer her up was of no avail</s> from what dave says there must have been a fierce fight she moaned</s> and more than likely our poor dear henry got the worst of it</s>  wellnever see the brave boy again</s>  and her tears burst forth afresh</s> i would go on a hunt for him only i know it would be next to uselessreturned her husband</s>  besides at such a time as this i feel my placeis at your side and with nell rodney and dave</s>  and she had to admitthat this was true</s> slowly the morning wore along</s>  it had stopped snowing and not a soundbroke the stillness outside of the gentle murmur of the brooks as theymet between the rocks and the songs of the birds in the forest</s>  not abreath of air was stirring and as dave climbed into one of the stockadetrees to survey the situation it looked as if no indians were withinmiles of them</s>  but this he knew to be untrue since white buffaloswarriors could not be far off and the enemy was surely working their wayin that direction</s> i fancy its the calm before the storm he said to rodney who havinghad several hours of rest felt much stronger</s>  well catch it all theworse when it does come</s> if only i wasnt crippled sighed rodney</s>  id fight just as hard asany of em</s> ive no doubt of that rodney</s>  well when the time comes perhaps youllhave your share of the shooting same as any of us</s>  you can watch from aporthole even if you have to sit down to it</s> yes ive already told captain tanner i wanted one of those places atthe north brook tonight</s>  i dont intend to let you fellows do the workwhile i go and sleep</s>  the women folks and the children are the only onesto take it easy</s> even the women folks will have their hands fullloading for uswhenthe real attack begins</s>  the first ten minutes are what counts</s>  it wasthat way when the indians attacked fathers trading post</s>  if we hadntput it to em hotlike from the first minute we would never have beatenem back</s> by the middle of the afternoon all that could be done was finished andthen captain tanner insisted upon it that the majority of the men andboys lie down to rest</s> you wont get any sleep tonight so make the most of your time nowwere his words</s>  then he climbed the tallest tree in that vicinity totake a long and careful look around</s>  but this survey brought nothing newto light</s> it was just sundown when the first alarm came in</s>  an indian carrying awhite feather was seen sneaking up to the stockade</s>  seeing it was one ofwhite buffalos followers the captain sent joseph morris out tointerview him</s> the indians who side with the french are coming announced thewarrior</s>  they come by the trail we traveled and by the trail in yonderpathway pointing with his hand</s>  they are in four bands and gray tailheard that they will strike tonight when darkness covers the land</s> this was all that the indian could tell but it was enough and josephmorris ran back to inform captain tanner and the others</s>  those who weresleeping were aroused and each man and boy was assigned to his place ofduty</s> as he had desired rodney was placed near one of the brooks</s>  the youngmans father was stationed some distance above him and dave an equaldistance below</s>  next to dave came a pioneer named ike lee and theothers followed completing the circle of the fort</s>  then all waitedanxiously for a first sign of the advancing enemy each with his eyesstrained to their utmost and with his finger on the trigger of hisfirearm</s> chapter xhow henry faredlet us now go back to henry morris and find out what occurred to theyoung hunter and mrs</s>  risley immediately after dave departed from theresting place in the forest</s> as we know the tired woman had fainted from exhaustion and for fullyten minutes henry had all he could do to restore her to consciousness</s> he rubbed her hands and wrists vigorously and fanned her face with hiscap and at last had the satisfaction of seeing her open her eyes</s> oh</s>  she murmured</s>  iiwhat happened</s>  did ii fall</s> you fainted

it may pay us to go slowwith so many redskins lurking about</s>  they maybehenry broke off short and thinking his companion was about to speakclapped his hand over her mouth</s>  through the stillness of the forest hehad caught sounds that could mean but one thingthe approach of severalmen</s>  in a moment more he caught glimpses of a flickering lightapproaching</s> we must hide</s>  he whispered in mrs</s>  risleys ear</s>  come there isnt asecond to lose</s> but where shall we go</s>  she panted her heart leaping into her throat</s> i cannot run a stepit will kill me</s> the young hunter looked around in perplexity</s>  there was some brushwoodto their right growing among some sharppointed rocks</s>  he caught hiscompanions hand and almost dragged her in that direction</s>  on the rocksmrs</s>  risleys foot slipped and she gave a cry of pain</s> my anklei have twisted it badly</s> hush</s>  they will hear</s>  he answered and seeing she could go no furtherhe caught her in his youthful arms and carried her forward</s>  in the midstof a clump of bushes he laid her down and threw himself flat beside herat the same time holding some brushwood down over them</s> by this time the glimmer of light had come closer</s>  it was a torch heldin the hands of a tall indian who was following up the trail of thewhites with great care</s>  the indian had with him six companions allarmed with either guns or bows and arrows and each hideous in hiswarpaint</s> hardly daring to breathe henry awaited their close approach his lefthand holding down the bushes and his right on his gun</s>  soon the warriorswere at the spot where mrs</s>  risley had fainted</s>  here they came to a haltand began to talk in low tones</s> it was a moment of intense anxiety and it must be confessed thathenrys heart almost stopped beating</s>  the warrior with the torch heldthe light aloft and all in the party gazed around with eyes as piercingas those of some wild beasts</s> illustration the warrior with the torch held the light aloft</s> in a moment more something happened which changed the tables of fortune</s> unable to bear the pain of her twisted ankle mrs</s>  risley drew in asharp rasping breath which sound reached the ears of one of theindians</s>  instantly he stepped in that direction and spoke to the warriorwith the torch</s>  three of the band came forward with swift steps andarrows pointed</s>  a yell rent the air telling that those in hiding werediscovered</s> seeing it was useless to remain prostrate henry leaped up</s>  an arrowwhizzed past his shoulder and would have struck him fairly in the breasthad he not leaped to one side</s> he too blazed away and saw the leading indian go down shot throughthe breast a serious if not a mortal wound</s>  then he pulled mrs</s>  risleyto her feet</s> run</s>  he cried</s>  run</s>  it is your only chance</s>  hide in the woods</s> she limped off but ere she had gotten a dozen steps two of the warriorswere after her and she was made a prisoner</s>  in the meantime henryretreated to a clump of birch trees and there made a stand against theremaining indians</s> the struggle which lasted but a few minutes was an unequal one</s> another arrow was fired and it grazed his left hand causing the bloodto flow freely and making the stains afterward discovered by dave</s>  thenone of the red men came up behind the trees and reaching out struck himwith the flat side of a tomahawk</s>  henry tried to turn and grapple withhis assailant but suddenly his senses left him and he knew no more</s> tis one of the morris family said the indian with the torch in hisnative tongue</s>  he made an examination</s>  he is not dead</s> a good capture said another</s>  we must take him along</s>  gonawak youmust help to carry him</s> and what of the woman</s>  asked the warrior addressed as gonawak wellknown throughout that territory for his extreme cruelty</s> talking deer will take care of her was the answer</s>  he is to takecare of all of them until this raid is over</s> but little more was said and in a few minutes the unconscious form ofthe young hunter was picked up and borne through the forest in thedirection of the nearest stream</s>  as has been said water leaves notrail and for this reason the redmen instinctively used the shallowstream for a roadway</s> when henry regained his senses he found himself strapped to the back ofa horse and moving slowly westward through the forest</s>  the wound on hishand had been allowed to bleed itself out</s>  he felt both weak and stiffand had a dull ache in his head where the tomahawk had landed andraised a goodsized lump</s> by a blaze on the animals neck henry recognized the horse he rode asone belonging to a pioneer living in that vicinity</s>  he was in thecompany of nine redmen four of whom were mounted on stolen horses</s>  fromthis he inferred that the risley cabin was not the only one which hadbeen attacked on that fatal night</s> he looked around but could see nothing of mrs</s>  risley nor of any othercaptives</s>  he was alone with the savage warriors and what they intendedto do with him there was no telling</s>  but he had good reasons forbelieving that a horrible fate was in store for him</s> i must get away if i can he thought</s>  they cant do any more thanshoot me if i try to escape and even that will be better than to beburnt at the stake</s> the indians now noticed that he had recovered consciousness and one ofthem rode closer and said sharplywhite hunter boy must keep still</s>  if yell will strike him</s>  and heflourished his tomahawk threateningly</s> where are you taking me</s>  questioned henry</s>  but the indian would notanswer and only told him to keep quiet</s> it was growing morning when the small band came to a halt at the bankof a wide stream where there was a series of rapids among the rocks</s> henry was cut loose and ordered to dismount</s>  then he was led to a nearbytree and tied up once more</s> will you give me a drink</s>  he asked of one of the indians but foranswer the redman slapped him sharply over the mouth and told him tohold his tongue</s> suffering much from thirst and from the wound on his left hand whichhad now begun to swell henry watched the indians as they prepared anearly morning meal for the light of dawn was now showing in the east</s>  afire of very dry wood which would give little smoke was lighted andover this two of the redmen prepared some deer meat they had beencarrying</s>  the smell of the cooking venison was tantalizing to henry buthe knew better than to ask for a portion of the repast</s>  once or twicethe indians came up to him but only to jibe at him and poke him withtheir guns or their bows while one made a move with his hunting knifeas if to cut out the young hunters heart</s> while the indians were busy eating henry tugged at his bonds with allthe strength he could muster</s>  but he was too weak and the warriors hadbound the rawhides too firmly for the youth to budge them</s>  he only madehis wound break out afresh and then had to stop wellnigh exhaustedwith his effort</s> getting away is out of the question he thought and a heavy sighescaped his lips</s>  they will keep a sharp watch on me until they getback to their village and then they will take great delight in torturingme in every way they can think of</s>  oh what savages they are every oneof them</s> thus musing henry watched the indians eat their meal</s>  when they hadfinished one warrior came to him with some of the scraps and with a cupfull of dirty water</s> white hunter boy can eat said the indian and untied one of hishands</s>  it was far from an appetizing meal and was decidedly scant</s>  butit was better than nothing and not wishing to starve to death henry ateall that was offered him and drank the water to the last drop</s>  then hisloose hand was once again fastened behind him</s> the indians were now holding a consultation

would rouse up in an effort to drive themback from whence they had come</s>  more than this there were among theindians such rascally traders as jean bevoir and these men in order tofurther their own

word came in through the friendlyindians under white buffalo that the french indians as they werecalled were preparing for some new move</s>  instantly every available manin the fort leaped for his gun and even some of the women armedthemselves determined to fight to the last rather than risk the horrorsof becoming captives of the enemy</s> but the alarm proved a false one for the indians although they shiftedtheir camp to the opposite side of the fort did nothing but exchange afew shots with several of the rangers</s>  yet this move kept the pioneerson the alert all night so that little or no sleep was had by anyone</s> i must say im so tired i can scarcely keep my eyes open said henryto dave</s>  if we elect to retreat i dont see how im going to eitherride or walk</s> take a nap said dave</s>  if another alarm comes ill call you</s>  andhenry dropped down and was in the land of dreams almost on the instant</s> on the following morning a council of war was held by captain

and the lieutenanthad been ordered not to hold fort lawrence but do his best to bring inthe settlers and families in safety</s> the indians are gathering steadily said lieutenant baldwick</s>  everyhour makes them stronger</s>  i think the sooner we strike out the better itwill be for us</s>  and in this captain tanner and the majority of thesettlers agreed</s> the main difficulty which presented itself was how to care for thewounded</s>  it would be running a grave risk to move joseph morris andseveral others but there was no help for it and the family were toldto prepare for leaving in an hour</s> we will make a litter between two horses said james morris</s>  rodneycan ride on one of the animals and lead them along the smoothest part ofthe trail he can find</s>  we will

rodney guided the horses with thegreatest of care yet there were many jolts to the litter which morethan once caused joseph morris to utter a groan he could not suppress</s> it was calculated that if nothing out of the ordinary occurred the partywould be able to reach winchester in three days but if the indiansfollowed them up and attacked them the journey would take much longerfor they would have to make a stand behind whatever breastworks theycould manage to erect and there remain until the coast was clear or theenemy drove them forth</s>  there was also the everpresent possibility thatthe indians would wipe out the expedition entirely a possibility thatmade many of the married men shudder as they thought of their wives anddefenseless children</s> we can consider ourselves lucky if we reach winchester without any morehairraising observed henry as they trudged along</s> right you are replied dave</s>  the indians seem worked up to the lastdegree</s>  theyll trap us if they possibly

whileone half of the ablebodied pioneers and soldiers remained on guard theother half had their first full meal since leaving the fort</s>  then theguard was changed and the other half satisfied the

it looks as if the indians had really given it up said dave as heand his father met on their walks up and down the two posts</s> dont be too sure answered james morris</s>  at this very minute theymay

onward march to winchester wasnow slower than ever and when night came only half the distance to thatfrontier town had been covered</s>  but a messenger had been sent ahead andnow several wagons came

news of the massacre as it was called had spread in alldirections and when the pioneers reached winchester they found the postalive with many others who had come in from all points of the compasssome

morrisesobtained shelter at the cabin of an intimate friend named mauricegibson</s>  gibson himself was a trader like james morris and his wifeabigail and mrs</s>  lucy morris had been old

yourcourage</s>  father and barringford and white buffalo will do all in theirpower to bring her back to us</s> two days of anxiety passed in the town and then it was reported that themajority of the

found traces of them but that is all he said</s>  they areundoubtedly in the hands of the indians who are taking them either tofort duquesne or else northward to lake erie</s>  i left mr</s>

both startled and alarmed when the wildcat came down almost ontop of his bare head and even more frightened when the beast made aleap for his naked shoulder</s>  he had had several experiences withwildcats and knew them to be both powerful and bloodthirsty</s> by instinct more than reason he dived and went down as far as possible</s> as soon as the water closed over the wildcats head it let go its holdand began to swim for the shore</s> henry was directly in the path of the beast and in a second more erethe young soldier had time to think of diving the wildcat was on hisback sinking its

weight</s>  the stream closed over him and he wentdirectly to the bottom</s> this time the wildcat did not let go its hold</s>  it clung desperately andwhen henry tried to shake it off it only sunk its nails deeper into hisflesh</s>  mechanically he started to scream when the water rushed into hismouth almost strangling him on the spot</s> by this time dave had reached the surface and the rings

hisgun</s>  dont see anything of the critter</s> just as he finished speaking there was a splash in the water and thehead of the wildcat appeared</s>  then up came henry and they saw that thebeast

quickly by another</s>  the aims of both rangers had beentrue and the wildcat was struck in the forequarter and in the head</s> with a snarl and a sputter it let go its hold of henry and splashedmadly

muttered dave</s>  save him</s>  and without waiting heplunged in the river once more</s> he felt deathly weak himself but the thought that his cousin might belost forever nerved him on</s>  with set

one of the rangers leaped into the river</s>  anothershot rang out a finishing one for the wildcat and the carcass of thebeast floated down the river and out of sight among the bushes liningthe opposite bank</s> by the time the ranger came up dave was nearly as far gone as henry</s> the old soldier was a powerful fellow and easily brought both to thebank which was only a short distance off</s>  here dave sank down in aheap while the other soldiers did what they could to revive henry</s> the report that a wildcat had attacked some bathers quickly spreadthroughout the camp and many flocked in that direction to learn theparticulars</s>  both dave and henry were given the best of attention andby the following morning each said he was able to resume his duties</s>  butboth were stiff from the treatment received from the wild beast and onhenrys neck were deep scratches which he was destined to carry with himto the grave</s> after this im going to be mighty particular where i bathe he said todave when on the march</s> yes and particular where you dive from returned dave</s>  if you seeanother wildcat on your springboard better let him finish his napwithout disturbing him</s> the march to cumberland was more difficult than had been anticipatedand the young soldiers were glad when it came to an end and they foundthemselves encamped just outside of the fort which both had visitedmore than once when on a trip to wills creek</s>  soldiers were coming infrom all directions and soon the camp was full to overflowing</s> wonder how long well stay here said henry after they had been atcumberland over a week</s>  i had an idea we were to march straight on tofort duquesne</s> there is some trouble over that new road to the fort answered dave</s> i understand colonel washington is awfully cut up over it</s>  he thinksthey ought to use the old braddock road and polish up the frenchmen inshort order</s> it was the delay that brought on defeat before thats certain dave</s> its a pity the british generals wont take washingtons advice</s> what dave said about trouble over the road was true</s>  the braddock roadoriginally selected by the indians was as good as any to be had ormade yet despite all arguments against it it was decided to cut a newroad through to fort duquesne from raytown</s>  it was true such a roadwould be a little shorter than the old road but to cut it would takeall summer and to keep up the campaign during the winter would bewellnigh out of the question</s> when a part of the colonial troops including the company to which daveand henry were attached reached raytown they found the new road alreadystarted with two hundred men engaged in cutting down trees removingbig stones and burning brushwood</s>  this was kept up week after weekand in the meantime the troops suffered greatly through sickness andlack of proper food</s>  many of the colonials grew disgusted at the slowprogress of the campaign and would have gone home had not the militaryregulations forbidden it</s> it was in the midst of this that sam barringford came in and hunted uphenry and dave</s>  thought youd like to set eyes on me he said onshaking hands</s>  jes got in with daves father</s>  we did some tall huntingi kin tell ye</s> and nell</s>  asked henry quickly</s> shes a prisoner up to fort duquesne</s>  we got thet putty straight</s> not of the french</s> no of the injuns hangin around tharthe jean bevoir crowd as davesfather calls ema bad lot too</s>
barringford had decided to take part in the campaign now in progress andit can well be imagined that the two young soldiers were right glad tohave their trusty old friend with them once more</s> it will seem like old times said dave</s>  if only we could move aheadtomorrow</s> it was late in october when dave brought in news</s>  he rushed up to wherehenry and barringford were industriously sewing up some holes in theirjackets</s> hurrah we are to move at last</s>  he cried</s>  major grant is orderedahead with eight hundred men and our company is to go with the body</s> only eight hundred returned barringford</s>  thet aint many</s>  kind o ascoutin party i reckon</s> yet he too was glad to make a movement of any kind and prepared atonce for the departure</s>  two days later the command was on the roadthose left behind wishing them the best of success</s> the english were still many miles from fort duquesne when the frenchscouts brought word to their commander that the enemy were approaching</s> without waiting to be attacked the french marched forth to do theapproaching english battle</s> the fight is on</s>  cried dave as several shots rang out from in front</s> we are in for it now</s> well we came to fight answered henry</s>  and the sooner the battle isover the better</s> the real battle however did not take place until the next day</s>  thenthe french did their best to surround the english and in a short whilethe contest waxed hot on all sides</s>  part of the battleground was a smallopening and the rest of the fighting took place in the forest</s>  soon thesmoke became so thick that but little could be seen on either side</s> tell ye wot them frenchers mean business</s>  ejaculated barringfordwhile reloading his firearm which was so hot he could scarcely hold it</s> weve lost a sight o men already</s> what he said was true</s>  the loss had been frightful and the dead anddying lay on every side</s>  moans and shrieks rent the air in a fashion toturn the stoutest heart sick</s>  major grant rushed around heedless ofdanger giving directions and doing all he could to encourage thoseunder him</s> dont retreat</s>  the battle is ours</s>  he called out</s>  stand where youare</s>  and then his voice was lost in the rattle of musketry and the madyelling of the indians who had come up to aid the french and steal whatthey could from the english</s> dave henry and barringford were behind a fallen tree blazing away asrapidly as possible</s>  the french were before them and the indians ontheir left and for some time it was as if pandemonium had broken loose</s> suddenly barringford gave a yell</s> duck boys duck</s> they fell flat and not a second too soon for half a dozen arrowswhizzed over their heads</s>  then the old frontiersman leaped to his feet</s> ill pay ye back</s>  he roared</s>  that fer ye ye sarpints o the evilone</s> illustration he took a quick but careful aim at the leader</s> he took a quick but

dave felt something hithim on the bottom of his left cheek and putting up his hand withdrew itcovered with blood</s>  henry too was hit by a flying fragment of the gunbarrel which clipped off a lock of his hair</s>  poor barringford lay likeone dead</s> before dave could recover the indians were on them whooping as if theirvery lives depended upon it</s>  one threw a tomahawk at dave but the aimwas poor and the weapon buried itself in the log which had sheltered ourfriends</s> but just at this moment when all seemed lost the battleground shiftedand instantly thirty or forty english

but dave henry and barringford were nottouched</s> attacked so unexpectedly from a new quarter the indians appeared dazed</s> they attempted to turn upon the english soldiers but when two more werelaid low they fled to one side where there was a dense growth ofwalnuts</s>  the soldiers at once made after them and another skirmish tookplace in the forest</s> are you hurt much sam</s>  asked henry when he had recoveredsufficiently to speak</s> ii reckon not was the gaspedout answer after a long silence</s> barringford opened his eyes and gazed ruefully at the gun stock whichlay at his feet</s>  busted</s>  well by gum</s>  didnt think old trusty would doit nohow</s>  aint ye ashamed</s>  and he shook his head dolefully</s>  he hadcarried the firearm for many years as our old readers know and to haveit go back on him like this hurt him more than had the explosion</s> it singed your beard pretty well said dave</s>  you can be thankful itdidnt blow your face to pieces</s> we must get out of here</s>  cried henry</s>  see the french are coming</s> henry was right the french column had suddenly appeared on the brow ofa neighboring hill</s>  those of the english who were in view received agalling fire and then the enemy came forward with a rush</s>  our friendswere glad enough to retreat and join the main body of rangers oncemore</s> unfortunately for the english major grant had divided his force and nowas the french commander came on he ordered that the smaller of theenglish commands be surrounded</s>  this was done and though major grantdid his best to bring his command together again it was impossible todo so</s>  the english became hopelessly separated and by the time thefighting came to an end the major and a large number of his officers andmen were made prisoners</s> we are catching it and no mistake panted dave after another standhad been made during which barringford had provided himself withanother gunone taken from the hands of a dead grenadier</s>  the frenchmean business</s> here they come again</s>  exclaimed henry</s>  look</s>  look</s>  they seem to havereenforcements</s> henry was right and it must be admitted that the attack of the frenchwith the indians on the left flank was a superb one</s>  the shock of thetwo armies coming together was terrific and soon handtohandencounters were taking place in hundreds of places at once</s>  guns andpistols rattled constantly and the keen frosty air of late fall wasfilled with smoke</s>  the grass being wet with dew many slipped and felland not a few soldiers were trampled to death by frightened horses</s>  itwas a scene not easily forgotten and reminded dave strongly of thatother battle when general braddock had suffered bitter defeat and death</s> and bitter defeat was again to be the portion of the english</s>  majorgrants force was not strong enough to resist the combined onslaught offrench and indians and at last word came to retreat and in thegathering darkness the english fell back taking with them a number oftheir wounded</s>  how many of the wounded were left on that coldbattlefield to die from exposure will never be known</s>  snow was nowfalling and a wind came up that chilled every soldier to the bone</s> its another braddock victory said barringford sarcastically as helimped painfully along a horse having stepped on the toes of his leftfoot</s>  them reglars dont understand fightin in the woods nohow</s>  yehev got to fight injuns injun fashion an french likewise</s>  twont dono good to set yerself up like a target to be shot at</s> we have lost about three hundred men killed wounded and capturedsaid dave</s>  i wonder what general forbes will say to that</s> i fancy hes too sick to say much said henry</s>  he spoke thus forgeneral forbes had been on a sick bed for several weeks and had had tobe carried forward on a litter whenever his command moved</s> the news that major grants command had been whipped and driven backand the major and many of his officers taken prisoners was quickly sentto general forbes and at once a council of war was held</s>  it was decidedthat the entire army should be sent forward without delay and thesoldiers moved onward as rapidly as the state of the road permitted</s>  bythe time the reenforcements arrived the french and indians hadretreated to fort duquesne for additional ammunition and generalsupplies and to take care of their wounded and prisoners</s> once again washington urged that a swift march be made on the fort</s>  itis our only chance of success he said</s>  in a few weeks winter will beon us and then the campaign in this wilderness must come to an end</s> there was no disputing his words for the snow continued to fall andwhen it did not snow it rained and the wind kept growing colder andcolder every day until even the most hardy of the soldiers began togrumble over the discomforts of camp life</s>  forward went the whole armytoiling painfully through the forest where only an imperfect indiantrail led the way</s>  general forbes was now weaker than ever and othersurged him to go back</s>  but full of determination he refused andcontinued to direct the movements of his army from his sick bed</s>  hisdevotion to duty was wonderful and something well worthy of beingremembered</s> dave and henry suffered with the other soldiers</s>  frequently when nightcame they had to rest in clothing that was soaked through and throughand the one grain of comfort they extracted from their situation was thethought that each days march brought them so much nearer to the spotwhere they supposed little nell was being kept a prisoner</s> i wont complain if only we get her back said henry</s>  and dave agreedheartily</s> it was now the middle of november and winter had begun to set in inearnest</s>  ice was forming on every pool and slowrunning brook and snowstorms were frequent although none of them amounted to much</s>  the nightswere the worst and many a large campfire did the soldiers build to keepthemselves warm</s>  an advance guard was out constantly to guard against asurprise but no french or hostile indians appeared</s> late one afternoon there were a number of shots fired in the distanceand half an hour later a small vanguard came in bringing with them anumber of french and indian prisoners</s>  these prisoners were closelyquestioned and from them it was learned that the french and indians atthe fort were suffering greatly from sickness and from a lack ofsuppliesthe latter having failed to reach fort duquesne on account ofthe english victories in the north</s> if you hurry you may take the fort with ease said one of theprisoners who wished to curry favor with his captors</s> this news was most encouraging and it was ordered that the main body ofsoldiers should push on again leaving the artillery and supply wagonsto come up later</s>  the news placed dave and henry in the best of spiritsand they pushed on as quickly as anybody with barringford beside them</s> but progress was slow for there were many hills to cross and onretreating the french had left many fallen trees in the pathway and inone spot was a dangerous pitfall into which the enemy had thrownseveral wolves</s>  a couple of grenadiers fell into this pitfall and weresadly bitten by the halfstarved beasts before being rescued</s> at last those in advance reckoned that they were now but one daysjourney from fort duquesne</s>  the ground looked familiar to dave andpresently barringford pointed out the spot where the young soldier andhis father had been reunited after the battle under braddock</s> soon from a distance came a hurrahing which every instant increased involume</s>  the fort is deserted</s>  the french and indians are retreating</s> can that be possible</s>  burst from henrys lips</s>  come let us findout</s> he rushed forward and dave and barringford quickly followed</s>  soon theywere in the vanguard which was scrambling over fallen trees andbrushwood and climbing the last hill which separated the englishsoldiers from the fort</s>  there was a thick smoke ahead and presently theysaw a column of flame shoot up followed by a dull explosion</s> they have fired the fort said barringford</s>  reckon as how theyllburn everything they cant carry</s> by the time the soldiers reached the vicinity of the stronghold the firewas burning low</s>  only a small portion of the stockade was gone with oneor two small buildings and what had been left of the stores</s>  an indianwas found nearby suffering from a broken leg and he gave theintelligence that the french command had retreated down the ohio</s>  somehad gone only a few hours before and others had left three daysprevious</s> and what of the prisoners they had</s>  asked henry as soon as he couldget the chance</s> the prisoners were taken away three days ago</s> were there any little girls among them</s> yes four little maidens</s>  one from the south and three from the eastwith two women and fortyone men was the reply</s> three girls</s>  murmured henry</s>  one of them must have been nell</s>  andthey took them off three days ago</s>  oh dave im afraid we have lost herforever</s> chapter xxat fort pittreturn homedave could do but little to comfort his cousin and if the truth be toldhe felt almost as sad as henry for little

follow down the ohio but if theyhave three days start there is small hope of our catching up</s>  theyllthink the english soldiers are after them and theyll push ahead just ashard as possible</s> do you think general forbes or colonel washington will go after them</s> dave shook his head</s> no general forbes is too sick and winter is now at hand</s>  he is certainto rest on his laurels</s> so it proved</s>  a small detachment was sent down the ohio and with thiswent our young soldiers and sam barringford</s>  but this detachmentreturned to the fort three days later having captured but threeindians and one french trader all of whom were found in a canoe toointoxicated to make good their escape</s> the trader thus taken was named varlette</s>  he had once been attached tojean bevoirs

than this with an empty gun he could do butlittle to defend himself</s> the big buck had now come to a halt and turned around</s>  he stood as ifuncertain whether to renew the attack or take to his

could not see and in amoment more hit the rocks of the cave with a crash that could be heardfor a considerable distance</s> good for you sam</s>  cried henry who was now reloading</s>  i reckon wevegot him</s> dont be too sure returned the old hunter</s>  hes got lots of fight inhim yet</s> barringford was right for again the buck turned and now catching aglimpse of barringford through the

yards wide and in many places thebranches of the trees on the opposite banks intertwined forming a longlow bower beneath which the sunlight was hardly able to penetrate</s> outside it was hot and dry but on this stream it was deliciously cooland under other circumstances henry would have enjoyed the canoe tripgreatly</s>  game was plentiful and frequently popped up within easyshooting distance</s>  the indians did not use their guns however althougha number of birds and a deer were brought down by the aid of a bow andarrows in the hands of an indian in the front canoe</s> before the trip on the river came to an end henry calculated that theyhad covered at least sixteen miles</s>  they went ashore just above a smallwaterfall and now the indians took their canoes with them</s>  the partyturned westward and henry guessed that they were bound for the easternshore of lake ontario</s> if they once get me on the lake ill be booked for canada thatscertain he mused dismally</s>  if only i had half a chance id run forit even though id risk being shot</s> chapter xxva storm on lake ontariowhen the soldiers under general prideaux reached oswego they found thefort in ruins</s>  three years before the french and indians under montcalmhad won a victory there and before leaving had burnt up and otherwisedestroyed every building large and small and also every ship in theharbor and had taken away all the guns and ammunition and a large partof the possessions of the settlers in that vicinity</s>  on every side wereheaps of ashes and charred logs some overgrown with weeds and in themidst of these stood a huge wooden cross erected by piquet the frenchpriest and on a tall pole hung the tattered arms of france</s>  the scenewas one of unutterable loneliness and desolation and it must beconfessed that something like a shiver went over dave as he gazed uponit</s> this shows what war will do he said to a comrade standing near</s> think of how prosperous a trading post oswego was three years ago andnow look at this</s>  why even a wild animal would shun the spotafterthose skeletons were picked clean</s> true for you lad was the answer</s>  but i dont think it will be thatway again</s>  general prideaux means business and so does general johnsonand the french will have to do some tall fighting to win out now</s> the first of the soldiers arrived on the site of oswego about the middleof june and it was only a few days later the remainder of the army cameup from lake oneida bringing the stores and baggage including a greatmany barrels of pork which in those days formed a staple article ofsoldiers diet</s> dave was anxious to see henry and barringford again and when the lastof the soldiers came up and went into camp not far from the lake and theriver he hurried in that direction as soon as he was off duty</s> oh sam</s>  he cried when he caught sight of the old frontiersman andsaw the serious look on his face</s>  wheres henry</s> i cant tell you dave</s> cant tell</s> no lad</s>  after we went ashore at lake oneida he disappeared like as ifthe earth had opened and swallowed him up</s> butbut didnt you look for him</s> dave you oughter know better nor to ask sech a question</s>  look</s>  why itramped miles an miles alooking fer himan fer them injuns</s>  but theredskins got away and we couldnt find henry alive or dead</s> then they must have taken him prisoner</s> thets it unlessunless what sam</s> wall i dont like to say lad</s>  let us hope fer the best</s> you mean they might have killed him and thrown his body into the lake</s> yes</s> dave drew a long breath</s>  the thought was a horrible one</s>  he shook hishead dismally</s> you didnt hear any shots or any struggling</s> nary a sound dave</s>  we went along as silently as ghosts and with ourears wide open</s>  i know henry was along when we moved up the lake but imissed him jest as soon as we turned to come back</s>  he had been next tothe lake front and i walked over to find out if he had seen anything ofthe injuns</s>  but he was goneand that was the end of italthough i andthe others hunted around until we simply had to give it up and come backto report</s> it was dismal news and all barringford could do did not cheer dave up</s> first it was little nell and now its henry he said soberly</s>  ifneither of them return what will aunt lucy say</s> as soon as the army was settled at oswego general prideaux had all ofthe batteaux and other boats made ready for the trip along the lakeshore to fort niagara a distance of about a hundred and thirty miles</s> in the meantime colonel haldimand was placed in charge of the garrisonto be left at oswego with orders to rebuild the fort and otherwisestrengthen the place as speedily as possible</s>  haldimand who during therevolution became governor of canada was an able and energetic officerand went about the work assigned to him without delay</s>  soon the ring ofthe axe was heard in the forest and the big timbers for the new fortwere being brought out as fast as the pioneersoldiers could handlethem</s> prideaux had expected to embark for niagara within a few days afterreaching oswego where he was joined by johnson with his seven hundredindians but numerous delays occurred and it was not until the first ofjuly that his novel flotilla of boats batteaux and canoes set sailwestward over the mighty waters of lake ontario</s>  all the time that thearmy was at oswego a sharp lookout was kept for the possible appearanceof french ships of war or of transports carrying french troops butnone came in sight</s> not a sail in sight anywhere said dave to schnitzer one day when thetwo were at the beach</s>  if the french are near they are keepingthemselves well hidden</s> maybe da vos vaiting for a chanct to

doing no doubt of that</s>  i wouldnt besurprised if they attacked colonel haldimand after we go away</s>
 and hans schnitzernodded his shaggy head vigorously</s> dave had been wondering if he would be ordered to remain behind withthose left at oswego or if he was to go forward to fort niagara</s>  he halfwished he would be told to remain behind that he might have a chance togo in search of henry</s> but this was not to be and a few days later came word that the companyto which he belonged would go forward under general prideaux</s> but im agoing to be left behind said sam barringford</s>  ive gotorders to take charge o the sharpshooters as is going to watch out herewhile colonel haldimand rebuilds the old fort</s> oh sam if you stay behind wont you keep an eye open for henry</s> to be sure i will ladthought o thet myself</s> do you think those indians are still sneaking around</s> moren likely not dave</s>  not if they war french spies</s>  theyve goneacross the lake to give warning of our coming</s> if they had henry a prisoner they would take him along</s> yesor worse</s> dave shook his head sadly and went about his work which was to see tothe loading of two batteaux that were piled high with utensilsbelonging to the culinary department of the armyfor soldiers likeordinary mortals must eat and if they are not served properly there isapt to be a good deal of grumbling</s> one day later the army was off in a long string of batteaux and othercraft stretching out a distance of over a mile</s>  it was truly an imposingsight for the leading batteau was flying the flag of england and otherbanners were by no means lacking</s>  there was music too to lighten upthe hearts of the soldiers and ringing cheers for good luck to theenterprise</s> it was general prideauxs plan to hug the shore of the lakeconsequently the trip would be a little longer than if they sailed in adirect line from oswego to what is now the coast town of carlton</s>  thereason for hugging the shore was that the french might swoop down uponthe flotilla at any moment when out of sight of land whereas if theenglish kept close to shore they could at any moment turn into one ofthe numerous bays or creeks and there hide or throw up a temporarydefense</s> the southern shore of lake ontario is today dotted with villages andtowns but when general prideauxs army sailed along this coast itshowed an almost unbroken front of gigantic timber rough rocks andstretches of sandy waste</s>  here and there was an indian village but thewarriors were away either with the french or the english</s> much to daves disgust lieutenant naster was placed in charge of thebatteau which contained besides dave several soldiers who were hardlyknown to our young soldier</s>  when naster saw dave he scowled but saidnothing</s> he has it in for me thats certain thought dave</s>  ill have to keepmy eyes wide open</s> i want none of your laziness said the lieutenant to dave an hourlater and when all hands were resting on the oars</s>  i see you are notpulling as well as the others and it wont do</s> i thought i was doing my full share answered dave</s> hi dont answer back boy</s>  do as i tell you</s> in a few minutes the rowing was resumed</s>  one of the soldiers unnoticedby the lieutenant winked at dave</s> hes a regular bear he whispered</s>  look out or hell make troublefor you</s> hes tried to make trouble for me before answered dave in an equallylow tone</s>  he doesnt like me because i stood up for old campwell whenhe was browbeating the man</s> oh so you were the soldier who interfered eh</s>  i heard of that case</s> they saysilence over here and attend to your rowing</s>  shouted the lieutenantfrom his comfortable seat in the stern</s>  dont you see how we arelagging behind</s>  pull up there all of you or somebody will get the lashtonight instead of his supper</s> after that but little was said and the rowing continued steadily untilnoon when a brief halt was made for dinner</s>  the lake was almost likeglass so that while some of the batteaux drifted together no damagewas done</s> if i know anything about it this weather wont last said one of thesoldiers after a careful survey of the sky</s> it looks like a storm to me too said dave</s>  but it may blow aroundbefore it reaches here</s> yet the day passed without the storm coming and that night theoccupants of the batteaux slept soundly on the shore of a tiny bayopening up from the lake</s>  at sunrise the army was again in motion andonce again the flotilla continued its journey westward</s> several soldiers who had been taken sick on the march to oswego had beenleft behind but now others were overcome by the heat and the glare ofthe sun on the water and one batteau had to be turned into a floatinghospital</s>  at one time dave himself felt dizzy but he said nothing forhe well knew that lieutenant naster would have no mercy on him sick orwell</s> the sun had come up over the water like a great ball of fire and by nineoclock the day promised to prove more than usually hot</s>  but an hourlater the clouds began to show up in the west and it became rapidlycooler</s> were in for that storm now said a soldier to dave</s>  see how the windis rising</s> yes and we are pretty far out from land now too added dave</s>  ireckon we ought to turn in</s> one of the soldiers appealed to the lieutenant but he would not listento advice</s>  straight ahead he roared</s>  you only want to go in that youmay rest</s>  we have no time to fool away</s>  a little rain wont hurtanybody</s> the wind rapidly increased in violence and soon the black cloudsovershadowed the sun making the surface of the lake dark and ominouslooking</s>  then came a gust that whirled the batteau around in spite ofall the rowers could do to keep the craft up to the wind</s>  the wavesdashed up drenching everybody</s> oh</s>  cried lieutenant naster for he had received some of the waterfull in the face</s>  steady there you fools</s>  dont let her swing around</s> if we dont pull to shore well be swamped</s>  cried one of the soldiers</s> i was a sailor for six years and i know this is going to be a big blow</s> give the order lieutenant unless ye want to see bottom putty quick</s> at these words lieutenant naster turned pale</s>  very well turn about andpull for the shore he said</s>  and dont lose time he added as he sawthe white caps chasing madly toward them</s> with much difficulty the clumsy batteau was swung around and the journeyshoreward began</s>  but valuable time had been lost and now the rain camedown in a deluge shutting out the view on every side</s>  the wind whistleda gale and in the midst of the downpour came a vivid flash of lightningand a crack of thunder that was deafening</s> as much for his own safety as for the others dave bent to his oar witha will pulling with might and main</s>  the sight of land was now shut outand the task was therefore a blind one</s>  on they went the wind blowingthe waves into the batteau until the craft was speedily in danger ofbecoming waterlogged</s> bail her out</s>  roared the lieutenant who was now as much alarmed asanyone</s>  bail her out or well go to the bottom</s> illustration bail her out roared the lieutenant</s> bail her out yourself came a voice from the front of the craft</s>  noneof us can leave the oars</s>  pull away boysits our only chance</s> it was the man who had been a sailor who spoke and all the othersoldiers obeyed him leaving the lieutenant to take up an iron dipperand begin the bailing as best he could</s> a moment later came a wild cry from beyond the batteau</s>  look out youare running into us</s>  back water</s>  the cry was followed by a thump and acrash and half a dozen yells of pain and then ensued a wild scramblefor safety for two of the batteaux had come together with such forcethat the bottom of each was broken away on one side letting in thelake water with a rush</s> when the collision came dave was thrown over backward into the lap ofthe soldier who had once been a sailor</s>  each clutched the other andboth struggled to their feet wondering what would happen next</s>  then thebatteau began to settle and in a moment more dave found himselfstruggling in the waters of lake ontario</s> chapter xxvithe attack at oswegoi wonder when this will end</s> such was the question which henry asked himself after he had been aprisoner of the indians for a week and more</s> the warriors had marched him to the eastern shore of the lake and herehe had been left in charge of two young warriors while the balance ofthe party had taken canoes and disappeared in the direction offrontenac</s> the days had passed slowly</s>  the warriors had found something of a cavefronting the lake shore and henry had been placed in this</s>  his handswere bound behind him almost constantly they being released only whenhe was eating or when both of his captors were at hand with their gunsto watch him</s> the young soldier often wondered what had become of sam barringford andthe others who had been in the party that had landed on the shore oflake oneida</s>  had they too been captured and carried off or had theybeen killed</s> sam ought to have been able to follow their trail he reasoned</s>  he didnot know that the trail had been followed as far as the stream where theindians had first brought forth their hidden canoes</s>
 the french commander at once gatheredtogether twelve hundred men consisting of canadian pioneers andindians and set out to do the english battle</s>  he felt that a forcewould be left behind at oswego and this he determined to annihilate assoon as general prideaux had gone on with the main portion of theenglish army</s> the coming of over a hundred indians to the camp on the lake frontsurprised henry and he wondered what was in the wind</s>  but he soon foundout for several of the newcomers could talk english and they did nothesitate to speak of the contemplated attack on colonel haldimandscommand and of their high hopes of again laying fort oswego in ashesand scalping all who should remain to defend it</s> after hearing this talk henry burnt with a desire to obtain his freedomand warn haldimand of what was coming</s>  for this purpose he resorted to aruse which worked better than he anticipated</s>  he pretended to be verysick and whenever the indians came near groaned dismally and put hishand to his head and then to his breast as if in intense pain</s> at first the warriors paid no attention for they did not care how muchhe suffered</s>  but after releasing him during meal time they grewcareless about tying him up again and left him to roll upon the groundas he pleased</s>  he now pretended to be sicker than ever and crawled overto a nearby pool of water where he bathed his head and then lay down asif utterly exhausted</s> behind the pool was a clump of bushes and back of this a stretch ofdense timber</s>  once in the timber he felt that he could hide untilnightfall and then make his way down the lake shore in the direction offort oswego</s>  perhaps he might even find a canoe for the indians had alarge number of these craft hidden in various coves and creeks</s> henry had to move with extreme caution for he realized that one mistakemight cost him his life</s>  once or twice he saw the warriors gaze towardhim and each time he led them to believe that he was in as great a painas ever</s> presently there was a shouting at the lake front announcing the arrivalof more indians and all of the warriors on land looked in thatdirection</s>  now was his chance and with the swiftness of a deer releasedfrom a trap he leaped across the pool and dove into the clump ofbushes</s>  he did not stop but at the risk of scratching himself in adozen places tore his way along into the timber and went on and onpellmell fetching up against more than one tree and tripping over onebig root after another</s>  once he went into a hole up to his knee and cameclose to breaking his leg which in the end would undoubtedly havecost him his life</s>  but he freed himself and did not stop but continuedhis course limping deeper and deeper into the forest</s> a yell of rage told him that his escape was discovered and soon heheard several indians thrashing around through the brushwood whileothers spread out for a search through the forest</s>  there was no doubtbut that they meant to retake him were such a thing possible</s> but they shant do it he muttered through his set teeth</s>  i must getaway somehow</s> when half a mile had been covered he was surprised to find himselfwithin sight of the lake</s>  at first he imagined that he had gone aroundin a circle and brought up at the point from which he had started butsoon he saw that the spot was a strange one some distance south of theindian camp</s> his injured shin hurt him not a little and he was glad enough to plungeinto the water up to his knees</s>  he had come out on a little bay and hereseveral overhanging trees and bushes afforded him good shelter</s>  hesecreted himself as best he could and awaited developments</s> the indians came within a hundred yards of the spot but no closer andbefore nightfall he was left entirely alone</s>  by this time the scrapedshin felt better and he waded out to the lake proper the water beingscarcely up to his knees</s> as night drew on he could see a faint light up the shore which toldhim where the indian camp lay</s>  all around him was silent and desertedonly the occasional cry of a bird breaking the stillness</s> henry felt that he must get some sleep or he would be unable toundertake the journey toward oswego in the morning and with this inview sought out a comfortable spot where he might lie down</s>  nothing cameto disturb him during the night and by sunrise he arose feelingdecidedly refreshed</s> a storm was approachingthe same which was to prove so disastrous tothe batteaux on the lake and henry had not covered many miles along thelake front when it burst on him in all of its fury causing him to seekshelter under a cliff of rocks some distance away from the water</s>  thelightning was sharp and he heard more than one tree in the forest godown with a crash</s>  but the storm did not last in that vicinity and intwo hours it was over although the drifting clouds still hid the sunfrom view</s> the storm proved a great blessing to henry for after it was over hecame across two squirrels that had been killed by it and also a numberof birds</s>  he had not had a mouthful to eat for twentyfour hours and henow set about making himself a fire and cooking the game</s>  he had a flintand steel which the indians had not taken from him and soon he had ablaze in a hollow where it would not be noticed</s> having satisfied the cravings of his stomach he renewed his journeyalong the lake front</s>  the storm had washed a number of things ashore andpresently he came upon an upturned indian canoe one of the roughersort made of a hollowedout log</s> hullo thats better than nothing he told himself and righted thecanoe although not without difficulty</s>  there was also a paddle on thebeach and soon he was on board the craft and paddling southward withall the skill he could command</s> as he moved over the waters of the lake he kept his eyes behind as wellas in front of him wondering if the indians would discover what he wasdoing</s>  but they were out of sight nor did a single warrior show himselfanywhere</s> it was growing dark again when henry brought his canoe to a sudden stopand then turned hastily shoreward</s>  far ahead he had seen another craftholding two men</s>  that they were whites he was sure but whether frenchor english was still to be determined</s>  he moved his canoe into a coveand secreting himself in the bushes awaited the approach of thestrangers</s> soon the boat came close enough for him to make out the voices of thenewcomers</s>  one voice sounded strangely familiar and peering through thebushes henry was overjoyed to recognize sam barringford who was sittingin the bow of the boat rifle in hand while his companion was rowing</s> sam</s>  sam</s>  he cried as he rushed forward</s>  oh sam how glad i am tosee you</s> well by the eternal ef it aint henry</s>  shouted the frontiersman inalmost equal joy</s>  this is dumb luck an no mistake</s>  why me and gangleycame out on purpose to see ef we couldnt find out what had become ofye</s>  are ye alone</s> yes</s> any injuns about here</s> there are a number up the shoreabout ten or fifteen miles from here</s> the boat was turned into the cove and soon henry and his old friend wereshaking hands and then the young soldier shook hands with gangley whowas an old hunter from pennsylvania</s>  the youth told his story in fullto which the others listened closely</s> i reckon the best thing we can do is to git back and tell colonelhaldimand how matters stand said barringford</s>  if the french areacoming this way hell want to know it</s> the craft barringford and gangley occupied was large enough for threepersons and soon henry was on board</s>  then the boat was turned about andthe trip to oswego began</s> on the way barringford told about daves departure with the force undergeneral prideaux</s>  he also asked if henry had learned anything concerninglittle nell</s> not a word although i questioned the indians all i could answeredthe youth</s> gangley was an expert at handling a small boat and the craft fairly flewthrough the water under his command and by the united efforts of thoseon board</s> they were just coming in sight of the fort at oswego when the sounds ofdistant firing reached their ears</s>  at first there were a few scatteringshots followed some minutes later by a regular volley</s> the french have arrived</s>  cried henry</s>  thats a regular battle</s> right you are lad returned the frontiersman</s>  see there are theirboatsa goodly number of em too</s> what shall we do</s> better land up the shore a bit and take to the woods</s>  it wont do forus to show ourselves in the open down theretheyd pick us off in notime</s> gangley also agreed that this was best and the boat was immediatelyturned toward shore</s>  they leaped out without delay and hiding thecraft proceeded without loss of time in the direction from whence theshots had come</s> chapter xxviinews of importancewhen general prideaux left oswego for fort niagara he was well awarethat the french would more than likely make an attack on the new fortcolonel haldimand was building consequently he cautioned that officerto be on his guard at all hours of the day and night</s> but haldimand needed no word of warning</s>  his military training was of ahigh order and the very first thing he did before setting his men towork to cut logs for the new fort was to have them arrange the porkbarrels containing a large portion of their food in a circle andoutside of this lay a dense mass of brushwood in such a fashion that toclimb over or through it would be no easy task</s> this pork fort as it was called later on caused many a laugh yet itproved no mean defense as we shall soon see</s>  behind the barrelshaldimand planted such cannon as prideaux had left him and then went towork to build the fort proper without loss of time</s> the french came over the lake with as much secrecy as possible</s>  in thedarkness they landed behind some brushwood and tall timber and took upwhat they thought was a position of advantage</s> the battle began the next day while the english were hard at workchopping down trees and cutting them up into proper sizes for the newfort</s>  a scout gave the alarm and this was immediately followed byseveral shots from the french and the bloodcurdling warcry of thehostile indians</s> realizing at once that the enemy had tried to steal a march on himhaldimand ordered his command to stop work and make for the pork fort</s> dropping their axes the soldiers and pioneers seized their guns and ranfor the shelter of barrels and brushwood</s>  several were wounded oneseriously and seeing this the command was given to fire in return andsomething of a pitched battle occurred</s>  but the frenchmen between theenglish and the improvised fort were easily scattered and thenhaldimand brought up his troops inside the barrel barricade and mannedhis guns with such vigor that all of the enemy lost no time in seekingthe shelter of the forest so close at hand</s> it was this first encounter which reached the ears of henry and hisfriends</s>  by the time they were on shore the firing had ceased and uttersilence prevailed as they crept slowly forward in the direction ofhaldimands command</s> do you think it possible that the french have withdrawn</s>  asked henrypresently as barringford put up his hand as a signal to halt</s> i think they are up to some trick was the low answer</s>  hist</s>  downwith ye</s> barringford had seen a tall french soldier moving toward them</s>  thefellow was a sharpshooter and carried his rifle ready for immediate use</s> the soldier was coming directly toward them and in a moment more henryfelt they would be discovered</s>  then without warning barringford leapedforward like a lightning flash caught the soldier by the throat andbore him to the ground</s> before henry could recover from his bewilderment it was all over andthe soldier lay flat on his back for in going over his head had struckon a sharp rock rendering him unconscious</s>  barringford took the mansgun and his ammunition box and handed them to the youth</s>  now yourearmed as good as any o us he whispered</s>  its lucky i cotched himjest right otherwise we might have had to do some powerful rasselineh</s>  come</s> once again they moved forward until they felt the barricade of porkbarrels could not be more than a hundred yards distant</s>  then a freshfiring broke out on their left and soon fifty or more french soldiershove into sight as they were making a detour from one side ofhaldimands defense to the other</s> come we must get out of here</s>  shouted barringford and as the enemycame closer he fired at the leading soldier</s>  henry and gangley alsoemptied their pieces and three of the enemy went down all badlywounded</s> running with all possible swiftness our friends soon reached a pointwhere they could see some of the pork barrels</s>  barringford held up hishands and was recognized</s> come in</s>  was the cry</s>  dont stay out there</s>  and then the three wentforward again</s>  but the french had also noticed them and half a score ofrifles were turned in that direction</s>  henry felt a bullet singunpleasantly close to his head and then saw barringford who was closebeside him stagger and go down in a heap</s> oh sam</s>  he cried in deep horror are you hit</s> there was no reply to this and henry saw the blood beginning to showitself around the old hunters neck</s>  in desperation he caught upbarringfords body and commenced to drag it to the entrance between thepork barrels</s>  gangley assisted him and soon they were behind thetemporary shelter with their burden</s> i hope he isnt dead</s>  said henry as he surveyed the motionless form</s> isnt there a surgeon handy</s> a medical officer soon appeared and barringford was carried to animprovised hospital but a short distance away and here the medical manmade a hasty examination</s> he isnt dead but hes pretty hard hit was the surgeons conclusion</s> ill do what i can for him</s>  no you cant help me</s>  better go to thefront and do your duty</s>  there is no telling how strong the french areand if they defeat us you know what we can all expecta dreary life ina canadian prisonor worse</s> there was no time to say more for the shooting had now started up oncemore</s>  it came from three sides</s>  the enemy remained hidden behind thetrees and it was only occasionally that the english could get a shot inreturn</s> will they make a general attack do you think</s>  asked henry ofgangley</s> that depends on how strong they are was the reply</s> it was a fearfully hot day and those behind the improvisedfortification suffered much both from heat and thirst</s>  it was onlyoccasionally that a french soldier or an indian showed himself and oftenhe was picked off before he could again find shelter</s> presently about two in the afternoon came a fierce yelling of indiansto the west of the fort and the redskins could be seen moving throughthe forest although they took care not to expose themselves too much toan attack</s> they are coming</s>  was the cry</s> but haldimand was not to be caught by any trick and he divided hisforce one half to meet the expected attack of the redmen and the othersto guard the side upon which the french were still located</s> but the attack did not come off</s>  not over a score of redmen ran out intothe open and when three of these were stretched lifeless by therangers or the royal americans as they were officially designated theremainder ran back with all possible speed</s> after this came another lull and henry ran to where barringford hadbeen placed</s>  he found the old frontiersman propped up against somebrushwood over which a pair of blankets had been spread</s>  he tried tosmile at the youth</s> got it putty bad said barringford in a low voice</s> intheneckcant talk</s> then dont say another word sam returned henry tenderly</s>  i am gladto learn its no worse</s>  you keep quiet</s>  i reckon we are safe so farand that was all that was said between them</s> hell be all right in a few days said the surgeon</s>  but he had anarrow escape</s>  had the bullet cut in half an inch deeper it would havegone through his windpipe</s> slowly the hours dragged by after this with only an occasional shot</s> but now haldimand was laying his plans for moving on the enemy</s>  someguns were brought into play on a certain bit of forest before the porkbarrel fort and when these were discharged the cries that followed toldthat the french had been taken by surprise</s> they are running for their boats</s>  was the announcement a little whilelater</s>  they are on the retreat</s> a cheer went up at this announcement and regardless of orders some ofthe rangers leaped out over the barrels and brushwood and made after thefrench who seemed to have suddenly become panicstricken</s>
it was seen that la corne was indeed retreating</s>  the french soldiers andthe indians were running in all directions and in the excitement adozen or more were sent sprawling on the shore</s> after em</s>  after em</s>  was the cry</s>  dont let em escape</s>  and thencame the rapid crackcracking of guns and rifles and long pistols andthirty of the enemy were killed and wounded</s>  la corne was struck amongthe number but not seriously wounded</s>
with the rangers who left the fort was henry and soon he and gangleyand four other pioneers were hurrying after a number of indians who werefleeing up the lake shore</s>  these were the redmen who had made henry aprisoner and he was anxious to square accounts with them</s> the indians had three canoes secreted in the bushes and they wereanxious to gain possession of the craft</s>  after a swift run of tenminutes they came in sight of the spot where the canoes were located</s> but now the rangers opened fire on them and two of the indians wentdown both wounded</s>  the indians returned the fire with a rifle shot andseveral arrows but nobody was struck</s> they shant git away so easy</s>  cried gangley and as the redmen leapedinto their canoes he opened fire again</s>  the others reloaded with allspeed and a volley was delivered as the light craft shot out into thelake</s>  one more redman was brought low and fell into the water with aloud splash and then the canoes drew out of range with all possiblespeed</s> the indian who had fallen into the water was a stranger to henry</s>  he wasnot seriously wounded and not wishing to drown came ashore althoughevidently in terror of the whites</s> dont shoot him</s>  cried henry as two of the others leveled their guns</s> why not</s>  drawled one of the rangers</s>  reckon as how he desarves itdont he</s> i want to question him</s> in a few minutes more the indian was a prisoner and then the rangersturned their attention to the pair that lay wounded some distance back</s> one was dying but the other suffered only from a slight wound in theleg</s>  the dying redman was left where he had fallen and the others weretaken back to the fort</s> it was not until some time later that henry got a chance to question thecaptured indians</s>  one could speak fairly good english but it was onlywith difficulty that the young soldier could make him tell anythingconcerning the indians in general and the prisoners they were holding</s> but after henry had taken the trouble to dress the wounded ones hurtand had supplied him with water and food the redmans tongue becameloosened and he listened to what henry had to say with increasedinterest</s> yes missapaw has seen the little girls he said</s>  two are of the samebirth and the other is called nell</s> and where are they now</s>  demanded henry eagerly</s> they are with some indians and some french traders in the westat themighty fall of waters</s>

tospeak</s>  do you reckon anybody will come to shore for us</s> moren likely some of the boats have been driven ashore answeredlapp</s>  let us be thankful that our lives have been spared</s> dave was thankful and as they crouched there in the darkness he uttereda prayer to god for his mercies and prayed that this adventure mightspeedily be brought to a safe conclusion</s> as we know the storm was not of long duration and by nightfall daveand lapp were walking along the shore searching for friends or forsome signs of the other batteaux</s> but strange as it may seem no boats showed themselves nor did asingle human being come into sight</s> might as well give it up said the sailorsoldier at last</s>  im tootired to stick on my pins a minit longer</s>  lets make a fire and dryoff</s> dave was agreeable and the fire was started although not without greatdifficulty</s>  in moving along the shore they had come across a few smallfish thrown up by the fury of the wind and these they cooked and ate</s> the next day found dave and lapp still in the woods</s>  in some manner theyhad strayed from the lake front and before nightfall they had coveredmany miles in an endeavor to set themselves right once again</s>  they hadfound no more game and being without means of shooting anything oreven of going fishing were almost starved for the want of food</s> weve got to do something said dave on the following morning</s>  if wedont well starve</s>  im going to try to bring down some birds withsticks and stones</s> he tried his best but though he followed his plan up for fully an hournot a bird did he hit and by that time his arm was so tired thatfurther throwing was out of the question</s>  in the meantime his coursehad brought him out on the lake front once more and now while herested simon lapp tried his hand at fishing with a hook made out of athorn and some line manufactured from threads from his shirt</s> but the fish would not bite and in an hour lapp gave up the attempt indisgust</s>  each looked at the other inquiringly</s> the lake is full o fish and the woods full o gamean yet it lookslike we were meant to starve morris said lapp slowly</s> oh dont say that</s>  cried dave</s>  something may turn upit must turnup</s> he had scarcely spoken when lapp leaped to his feet and pointed down thelake shore</s>  a boat</s>  he cried</s> there was a speck on the water and as it grew larger dave saw that itwas indeed a boat quite a large affair carrying a small sail and inaddition several men at oars</s> were those in the craft friends or enemies</s>  that was the interestingquestion and dave felt his heart beat rapidly</s>  if they were friends allwould be well but if enemies</s>  they would not wish to exposethemselves and yet to starve to death was out of the question</s> as the boat came closer they crawled behind some bushes and croucheddown out of sight</s>  slowly the craft glided up until it was less than ahundred yards away</s>  then simon lapp leaped up and swung his arms wildly</s> boat ahoy</s>  he cried</s>  boat ahoy</s> those in the craft heard the call and the rowers stopped rowing whileall looked with interest toward the shore</s>  then dave uttered a yell</s> henry</s>  henry</s> hullo dave is that you</s>  was the answer</s> yes</s>  come in and take us on board</s>  we are almost starved</s> how many of you there</s>  questioned the officer in charge of the boat</s> only two answered simon lapp</s>  and unarmed at that</s> its all right sir said henry to the officer in command</s>  that ismy cousin who left oswego with general prideauxs command</s>  i dont knowwhat he is doing here though</s> the boat came ashore and soon henry was shaking dave by the hand</s>  thehungry ones were provided with food and although this consisted ofnothing better than some boiled pork with beans and crackers which wereanything but fresh never had a meal tasted sweeter to both</s> the officer and the others listened with interest to what lapp and davehad to tell</s>  they had come across the waterlogged remains of the wreckedbatteaux and had been watching sharply for any signs of floating bodies</s> they had come across that of lieutenant naster and had buried it but afew hours before</s>  the news that the lieutenant was dead caused dave toshudder</s> the rangers were bound for the niagara river having been sent out bycolonel haldimand with a message to general prideaux telling the latterof the defeat and retreat of la corne</s>  it was possible that la cornewould now move onward to assist in the defense of fort niagara in whichcase measures would have to be taken to cut him off</s>  but la corne hadbeen too thoroughly whipped to move westward and besides he was soonafter needed in other directions</s> of course the news which henry had to tell about little nell and jeanbevoir was of great interest to dave</s> did the indian tell you just where she was being kept</s>  he asked</s> he said so far as he knew the captives and the traders were at anindian village called shumetta not over two miles away from niagarafalls</s>  he said jean bevoir spent part of his time at shumetta and therest at venango where he has charge of a company of traders who intendto fight in the french army if the war is carried into that territory</s> i hope bevoir does fight and that we get a chance at him</s>  cried dave</s> i really think id take pleasure in laying him lowsuch a rascal as heis</s> after the privations of the past two days dave was well content to takeit easy as the boat sped on

constant watch was kept for a possible french sail butnone appeared</s> it took general prideauxs flotilla between six and seven days to makethe journey westward and it was not until the troops were landing thatthe boat containing dave and henry reached the main army</s>  generalprideaux was at once acquainted with what had occurred at oswego andseemed well pleased to think that la cornes strategy had not availedhim</s>  he already knew of the loss of lieutenant naster and of fourothers who were swept away by the storm</s> dave and lapp had been given up for lost by their friends who hadescaped from the wrecking of the batteau and their reappearance washailed with delight</s> it was general prideauxs plan to land some distance from fort niagaraand then lay siege to the place</s>  the soldiers disembarked as silently aspossible the trees rocks and bushes keeping them well hidden fromthose in the fort</s>  then while several companies were left behind toguard the boats and

the fort was captain pouchot an able french officerwho had seen service for many campaigns</s>  he had under him a force ofabout six hundred soldierstrained veterans who could boast of morethan one victory</s>  up to a short while before there had been othersoldiers in this vicinity but not dreaming of an attackfor his indianspies had this time failed himthe french officer had allowed these todepartto venango and other trading posts and to several of the nearbyindian villages</s>  it was midsummer and traders and indians hated to domilitary duty when they could bring down game and make trades</s> chapter xxixthe battle near the fallswe are certainly in for a fight now henry</s> it was dave who spoke as he examined the priming of his new gun tomake sure that the weapon was ready for use</s>  that little brush daybefore yesterday woke the french up and they will sail into usheavilyif they can he added</s> well we came to fight returned henry as he too looked his weaponover</s>

behind a breastworks which had beenthrown up early that morning</s>  the first works thrown up by the englishengineering corps had proved untenable and the french had fired on themwith disastrous effect</s>  but now they were comparatively safe and theenglish gunners were serving their various cannon steadily andeffectively knocking the logs of the fort into bits with almost everydischarge</s> the fort had been under bombardment for several days and the youngsoldiers had been out on the firing line three times</s>  but only one ofthese times had been of any consequence and that was when a frenchcannon ball hitting some loose stones had sent the latter in theirfaces scratching them both on each cheek and blinding a soldierstanding between them</s> the bombardment had been opened at rather long range for generalprideaux had not known the exact strength of the french garrison</s>  nowthe worthy english general was dead having been killed on the secondday by the unexpected explosion of a shell as it was being fired by someenglish gunners from a small bronze mortar generally called a coehorn</s> the killing of general prideaux placed the command of the expedition inthe hands of sir william johnson who up to this time had been givingall of his attention to the indians who had volunteered to aid theirenglish brothers</s>  johnson was as quick to act as he was brave andhaving stationed his indians where he could call upon them at a momentsnotice had the english make another advance on the next day whichbrought the cannon to bear directly on the most vital parts of the fort</s> captain pouchot was now thoroughly alarmed and under cover of darknesssent out messengers in various directions to bring up the soldierstraders and friendly indians from venango presqule detroit andother points</s>  these different forces were to join together at some pointnear lake erie and then sail down the niagara river to the vicinity ofthe falls where they were to disembark and then march forward with theidea of attacking the english from the rear</s> having sent forth his messengers the french commander now undertook todo his best until the reinforcements should arrive</s>  the english attackwas answered with spirit so that day after day the air was filled withshot and shell hurled either into the fort or from it</s> the attack dave had mentioned came late that afternoon and was followedby another on the next day and still another two days later</s> it was hot work for the july sun blazed down with unmitigating vigorand had the young soldiers not been toughened to a life in the open theywould have done as many of the english grenadiers did fallen down inthe entrenchments exhausted</s>  there was a continual demand for water andit was fortunate for all that a good supply was close at hand</s>  this samesupply more than once saved the fort from burning down</s> both dave and henry had hoped to gain permission from general johnson togo off in

stay with me andif we win outas we musti will do all possible to rescue thechildren</s> the general was sure of a victory and his spirit proved contagious toall under him</s>  as the days went by the bombardment of the fortcontinued until captain pouchot had lost fully half a hundred of hisgarrison</s>  impatiently he awaited the reinforcements from up the river</s> but if he had expected to catch sir william johnson napping he was sadlymistaken</s>  the commander of the english forces was thoroughly wideawakeand had his scouts out in all directions and these included a dozen oldbackwoodsmen

oswegoto fort niagara not alone to aid sir william johnson but also to assistthe morrises to find little nell</s> the attack on the fort had begun on the seventh of july</s>  on thetwentyfourth word came in through the spies that a force of french andindians were coming down the river from lake erie</s>  this body ofsoldiers traders and indians was twelve hundred strong and wascommanded by several french officers of note</s>  the traders were of themost savage and lawless kind and many of them were in the habit ofdressing like the indians and smearing their faces with the samewarpaint</s> the word concerning this body came in late in the day and that nightgeneral johnson ordered forward a large part of his force includingsome grenadiers some rangers and his indians</s>  the troops were cautionedto move forward without making unnecessary noise and to be certain ofwhat was taking place before opening fire</s> now for some real fighting</s>  cried dave</s>  this wont be any such playas besieging the fort</s> well that hasnt been play to my notion answered henry</s>  at least itwasnt play when that cannon ball came and blinded poor campbell</s> well im with ye

trudged forward along the indian trail which led along thebluff on the east side of the niagara river the youths related theirvarious adventures</s>  barringford was astonished to learn how dave

when we cant help ourselves it doesseem jest like an arm reached down out o the clouds to give us a lift</s> on and still on went the soldiers some keeping to the trail and othersskirting the river

down to rest and despite theundertone of excitement observable on every hand fell into a lightslumber from which barringford did not arouse them until it wasabsolutely necessary</s> when they awoke there was a fierce yelling in the distance followed bya number of scattering shots</s>  the fight had opened between the mohawkson one side and the iroquois on the other</s>  soon the french tradersleaped into the fray and then the soldiers on both sides followed</s> the french and their allies had come around the falls by the portagetrail and the battle began at some little distance

cry</s>  forward</s>  we must drive them back</s>  they mustnever reach the fort</s>  and forward went our friends and in a momentmore dave henry and barringford found themselves in the very thickestof the fray</s> dirty looking traders confronted them several dave had seen before onthe kinotah and some of these tried their best to bring down the son ofthe english trader they so hated</s>  but dave was untouched although onebullet did pierce his jacket</s>  the rush of the english rangers wassuccessful and soon the frenchmen scattered to the right and the left</s> but now a body of french soldiery was coming forward on thedoublequick</s>  the rangers had no time to reload their weapons and soleaped forward for a handtohand contest such as soldiers of todayknow little or nothing about where bayonet met clubbed musket and swordthe long and equally dangerous hunting knife of the pioneer and wheremany a contest was settled in short order with the naked fist if nobetter weapon

bayonets</s>  he struck one of theenemy on the head sending him reeling but the force of the blow madehim lose his balance and he too fell but only upon his knees</s> ha</s>  now we have you</s>  cried another french soldier close by as he sawhenry slip and lowering his bayonet he charged on the youth intendingto run him through on the spot</s> chapter xxxinto the niagara rapidsfor the moment

wild leap forwardhe swung his clubbed musket at the french soldiers head</s>  the blowhowever merely grazed the enemys cap which fell upon the forestsward</s>  then the frenchman drew back and made another desperate lungeforward</s> illustration he swung his clubbed musket at the french soldiershead</s> at that instant a rifle report rang out</s>  sam barringford who had justreloaded his weapon

heavy with gun smoke so that inspots but little could be seen and more than once it happened that oneside or the other fired into the ranks of its friends</s> inside of quarter of an hour our friends found themselves in somethingof an open spot bordering the river at a point where the rapids rushedfuriously along the rocks on their way to the lake</s>  here as they weremoving forward to join a body of english soldiers fifty yards awaythey were suddenly confronted by a body of iroquois who came upon themuttering the most horrible warcries the youths had ever heard andbrandishing their tomahawks and scalping knives</s> on yer guard thar</s>  came from barringford</s>  they air after ushotfooted now</s> he swung around and as the nearest iroquois came within a dozen stepsof him he

attacked</s>  a tall iroquoisstraight as an arrow leaped upon him and tried to stab him with ahunting knife</s>  the young soldier warded off the blow with his gun andin a trice the pair were locked

attacked so they could do nothing fortheir companion</s>  the iroquois were ten strong and soon it looked as ifall our friends would undoubtedly be killed and scalped</s> the indian who had attacked dave had made a desperate clutch at theyoung soldiers throat</s>  but dave had caught the wrist so quickly thrustforth and now the two were fighting with one arm of each thrust out andup and the other wound tightly about the enemys neck</s>  thus they swayedback and forth each doing his best to force an advantage and eachfailing</s>  both looked about thinking that possible assistance might beat hand but all the others engaged in the combat were too busy tonotice them</s> slowly but surely the pair drew closer to the edge of the river whichat this point was some fifteen or twenty feet below the ledge of rockupon which the combat was occurring</s>  in the stream the rapids swirledand boiled in every direction occasionally sending a shower of spray upto their very feet</s>  the dampness made the rocks slippery and both hadall they could do to retain their footing</s> at last dave seemed to obtain a slight advantage</s>  the indian relaxed hisvigor for just a moment and in that fraction of time the young soldiercaught him by the throat and gave him such a squeeze that the redmanswindpipe was wellnigh dislocated</s> at this the indian uttered a grunt and began to back away

southward not a french soldier or an unfriendly indianremained in sight</s> for the day had been irretrievably lost to the enemy and with onehundred and fifty of the french and indians killed and over one hundredfrench taken prisoners the remainder of the attacking force had fled inwild confusion past the falls and upper rapids to where lay the boatswhich had brought them down from lake erie</s>

rangers were resting several of the numberwent off in search of game for provisions were now running low</s>  themost of the birds and wild animals had been scared away by the noise ofbattle and the hunters had to beat about for several miles before theyfound what they wanted</s> on the return to the camp beside the river they heard a man callingfeebly in french and moving toward the sound discovered a frenchtrader lying in some brushwood covered with blood and dirt the pictureof weakness and despair</s>  the trader had been shot in the leg and couldnot walk and was suffering for the want of food and water as well asattention to his wound</s> for ze love of heaven do not leave me here he begged piteously</s> help me kind sirs and i vill revard you vell</s> the trader was evidently a rough sort of a man yet the rangers tookpity on him even though he did belong to the ranks of the enemy</s>  foodand drink were furnished and the wound washed and bound up and thenthe rangers carried the prisoner with them to the camp</s>
dave and barringford saw the rangers returning and at the sight of theprisoner barringford leaped to his feet in high excitement</s> jean bevoir</s>  he exclaimed</s>  jean bevoir jest as sure as fate</s> bevoir</s>  ejaculated dave</s> bevoir</s>  repeated henry who stood near</s>  do you mean to say thatfellow is bevoir</s>

 and remember if you are tellinga lie it will go hard with you</s> chapter xxxiilittle nellconclusionjean bevoir was now thoroughly cowed and once having exposed himself hedid all in his power to curry favor with those he had so deeply wrongedin the hope that they would relent in their treatment of him and perhapsgrant him his ultimate liberty</s>  but neither henry nor the others wouldmake him any promises for nobody had any intention of letting him gofree</s> he deserves to become a prisoner said dave</s>  and he ought to be putin solitary confinement and on bread and water</s> right ye are lad said barringford</s>  hes wuss nor a snake in thegrass</s>  i dont wonder henry felt like pepperin him on the spot</s> it was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who hadbeen out on the hunt were thoroughly tired yet it was arranged thatthose who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the fallswithout delay after getting minute directions from jean bevoir so thatthere should be no chance of making a mistake in the route</s>  a strictguard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that ifanything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little nelland the others the blame would fall upon him</s> it must be said that the hearts of both henry and dave beat rapidly asthey pushed along the trail leading towards the falls</s>  henry as weknow loved his little sister dearly and daves affection for hislittle cousin was scarcely less strong</s>  throughout the whole campaignthere had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of whatshe must be suffering</s> barringford led the advance having questioned bevoir so closely that hesaid he felt he could find the cave in the dark</s>  as the party moved onall kept their eyes and ears wide open for a possible surprise by theenemy</s> but as we already know french and indians had fled in the direction oftheir boats beyond the upper rapids and the only persons met with werehalf a dozen braves under white buffalo who were out doing spy duty forgeneral johnson</s> heap glad to see dave well said white buffalo when they met</s>  heardave go into rushing waters</s>  glad dave get out</s> so am i glad white buffalo</s>  and how did you make out in the battle</s> for answer the chief pointed to his girdle at which hung two freshlytaken indian scalps</s>  then he pointed to the girdles of his followersall similarly adorned</s>  dave nodded to show that he understood</s> in these days such a showing would make one shiver but in colonialtimes the taking of scalps by the indians was such a common occurrencethat it occasioned little or no comment especially when practiced on anenemy of the same color</s>  a few of the french soldiers had been scalpedbut not many since general johnson had given strict orders that nomutilation of the whites would be allowed</s>  on the other hand the frenchindians engaged in the battle had committed all the atrocities possiblebefore retreating to the upper river and the woods</s> learning what was taking place white buffalo asked the privilege ofjoining the party with one of his braves and this was readily granted</s> on they went again through the thick undergrowth and around the roughrocks for in those days where the town of niagara falls now stands waslittle short of a complete wilderness</s> at length white buffalo called a halt and pointed to the ground</s> barringford had been watching the trail intently</s> fresh footprints eh white buffalo</s>  queried the frontiersman</s> indians close by answered the chief gravely</s>  no friends to theenglish</s> then well go slow</s> the indian grunted and the word was passed for every soldier to be onhis guard</s>  barringford now calculated that they were less than quarterof a mile away from where jean bevoir had said the cave was situated</s> suddenly a shot rang out and this was followed by the whizzing of anarrow over barringfords head</s>  one of the rangers had been struck in theshoulder although the wound was but a trifle</s> this way shouted barringford who had been chosen as the leader andall followed him to a thicket</s>  in another moment they had caught sightof several indians and two french traders hurrying along a trail leadingto the river bank above the falls</s> look</s>  look</s>  cried dave suddenly</s>  there is little nell now</s>  an indianhas her in his arms</s> he was right and soon they saw two other indians who were carrying therose twins</s>  the dusky trio appeared but for a moment then slipped outof sight in the timber</s> with a yell to the others to follow dave darted after the redman whoheld little nell and henry barringford and white buffalo came closebehind him</s>  on they went through thickets which almost tore the clothingfrom their bodies and over rough rocks</s>  the indians seemed to know theway and kept a good distance ahead despite their burdens</s> but now those in front had to cross a little opening and while doingthis barringford and white buffalo fired on them bringing two of thenumber down</s>  they were the indians holding the rose twins and in a fewminutes more the twins who were sobbing in fright were safe in therangers care</s> the indian holding little nell now bounded on with increased speedmaking directly for the bluff overlooking the mighty falls</s>  he knew ofthe opening under the falls and hoped by some chance to throw hispursuers off the scent and gain this hidingplace</s> but those in pursuit were too clever for him and in perplexity heturned like a hunted hare and started out on the bluff</s>  then as hecame again into the open he swung little nell to his back and held herthere</s> he is making for the falls</s>  screamed henry</s> what</s>  do you think he means to jump over</s>  questioned dave in freshhorror</s> it looks like it</s>  i reckon hes afraid if hes captured that welltorture him</s> this was probably the truth and having glanced back once to see ifthey were still pursuing him the indian kept on until he was less thanfifty feet away from the brink of the cataract</s> oh daveshall wewe shoot</s>  faltered henry</s> we must</s>  was the quick answer</s>  its our one chance to save nell</s> up came his gun and up also came the weapons of henry and severalothers of the party</s>  four reports rang out almost as one</s>  the indianstaggered a dozen steps and pitched headlong carrying little nell downwith him</s>  both lay perfectly still close to the brink of the cataract</s> for the moment neither henry nor dave dared to go forward</s>  supposing oneof those four bullets had found little nells body instead of that ofthe indian</s> it was barringford who advanced with several of the rangers</s>  a glanceshowed him that the indian was dead with two bullets through the lowerportion of his back</s>  little nell lay beside the fallen indianunconscious and with the blood flowing from a scratch on her right lowerlimb</s>  she was only stunned by the shock and as barringford picked her upshe opened her eyes wildly</s> let me go</s>  please let me go</s>  she screamed and then on catching sightof her preserver stared in astonishment</s>  oh mr</s>  barringford is itreally you</s>  oh im so glad</s>  save me from the naughty indian</s> the injun is dead nell he answered and then as henry and daverushed up he added you are safe enough now</s> henry caught his little sister in his arms and both hugged each othertightly</s>  the young soldier was too overcome to say a word nor coulddave speak as he embraced his cousin</s>  it was truly a happy moment</s> in a little while the other rangers came up with the rose twins whowere as delighted as little nell to find themselves among friends oncemore</s>  in the mean time the other unfriendly indians and the frenchtraders disappeared and although white buffalo and some of the rangerswent after them they could not be captured</s> that evening seated around a generous campfire and after the bestsupper they had enjoyed for many a day little nell and her companionstold the tale of their captivityhow the indians had at first carriedthem off how they had been moved from one spot to another and of howjean bevoir had finally taken charge of them</s>  the little girls were tooyoung to understand how the rascally trader had hoped to make money byhaving them ransomed but the boys and the other soldiers understoodand they made up their minds that bevoir should not escape them and thatthe whole matter should be laid before the proper authorities at theearliest possible date</s> but i am so glad to be with you again</s>  murmured little nell as shenestled down between henry and dave</s>  i hope the bad indians never carryme off again</s> they shall never do it if i can help it answered henry and daveechoed the sentiment</s>           let me add a few words more and then bring to a close this story of twoyoung soldiers adventures while marching on niagara</s> on the day following the rescue of little nell and the rose twins allour friends took themselves to fort niagara which was now occupied byfrench and english combined</s>  with the party went jean bevoir athoroughly miserable prisoner of war</s>  the trader begged hard to be givenhis freedom and offered all sorts of inducements to those having him incharge but nobody would listen to him and one ranger threatened tothrash him if he ever mentioned a bribe again</s>  at the fort the matterwas laid before sir william johnson and bevoir was placed under guardin the military hospital and that was the last seen or heard from himfor some time to come</s> little nell was very anxious to get back home to see her father andmother as well as rodney and her uncle james and it was finallydecided that she should be sent back along with the rose twins and anumber of other captives who had turned up</s>  the party was placed incharge of a company of rangers including hans schnitzer who in thesiege of the fort had lost an ear and of barringford who had given hisword to joseph morris that if he found little nell he would not leaveher out of his sight until the miss was once again with her parents</s> but what will you boys do</s>  questioned the backwoodsman of dave andhenry</s> we have decided to remain in the army and see this war to a finishsaid dave</s>  weve got the french and their indian allies on the run asthey call it and both of us feel that its our duty to remain at thefront</s> that feelin does ye both credit was barringfords answer</s>  well ireckon youll git fighting enough before youre done</s>  if it keeps onvery much longer i allow as how ill be back with ye sooner or later</s> what barringford said about getting fighting enough was true and thefurther adventures of our young friends will be related in anothervolume to be entitled at the fall of montreal or a soldier boysfinal victory</s>  in this volume we shall meet all our old friends againand learn what they did toward establishing a lasting victory overfrance in canada</s> it was not long after the taking of fort niagara that the boys receivedgood news from home</s>  matters were going well with all those left behindand they were delighted to learn that little nell was safe and wouldsoon be with them</s>  daves father was likewise delighted to learn thatjean bevoir was a prisoner and that the french hold on the ohio riverand its tributaries was broken</s>  he felt certain that the french tradersand the indians under them would never regain that which had been lostand that in another season at the latest he would be perfectly safe inreestablishing his trading post on the kinotah and that by that timematters would be in proper shape for doing more trading than everbefore</s> i hope what he says proves true said dave as he and henry read theletter on the subject</s>  i think we deserve whatever we can get out ofthat tradingpost seeing how hard we have worked to gain possession ofour own</s> i am glad matters are going on so well at home returned henry</s>  mybut wont mother be glad to see nell again</s>  theyll hug each other todeath</s>  and he wiped something like a tear from his eye as he picturedthe scene in his mind</s> in the darkness of the evening daves hand stole into that of hiscousin</s>  i am just as glad over it all as you henry he said softly</s> and then after a short silence he added there is no disputing it</s>  godhas been very good to us dont you think so</s> for answer henry gave his hand a tight squeeze</s>  we can be thankfulwere alive considering what weve gone through with</s>  war is no holidaymaking</s> youre right its not</s>  but im glad im a soldier
