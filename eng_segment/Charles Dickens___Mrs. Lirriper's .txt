moretremenjous noises when bad sailors</s> but my dear the blueness and the lightness and the coloured look ofeverything and the very sentryboxes striped and the shining rattlingdrums and the little soldiers with their waists and tidy gaiters when wegot across to the continentit made me feel as if i dont know whatasif the atmosphere had been lifted off me</s>  and as to lunch why bless youif i kept a mancook and two kitchenmaids i couldnt got it done fortwice the money and no injured young woman a glaring at you and grudgingyou and acknowledging your patronage by wishing that your food mightchoke you but so civil and so hot and attentive and every waycomfortable except jemmy pouring wine down his throat by tumblersfulland me expecting to see him drop under the table</s> and the way in which jemmy spoke his french was a real charm</s>  it wasoften wanted of him for whenever anybody spoke a syllable to me i saysnoncomprenny youre very kind but its no usenow jemmy</s>  and thenjemmy he fires away at em lovely the only thing wanting in jemmysfrench being as it appeared to me that he hardly ever understood a wordof what they said to him which made it scarcely of the use it might havebeen though in other respects a perfect native and regarding the majorsfluency i should have been of the opinion judging french by english thatthere might have been a greater choice of words in the language thoughstill i must admit that if i hadnt known him when he asked a militarygentleman in a gray cloak what oclock it was i should have took him fora frenchman born</s> before going on to look after my legacy we were to make one regular dayin paris and i leave you to judge my dear what a day that was withjemmy and the major and the telescope and me and the prowling young manat the inn door but very civil too that went along with us to show thesights</s>  all along the railway to paris jemmy and the major had beenfrightening me to death by stooping down on the platforms at stations toinspect the engines underneath their mechanical stomachs and by creepingin and out i dont know where all to find improvements for the unitedgrand junction parlour but when we got out into the brilliant streets ona bright morning they gave up all their london improvements as a bad joband gave their minds to paris</s>  says the prowling young man to me will ispeak inglis no</s>  so i says if you can young man i shall take it as afavour but after halfanhour of it when i fully believed the man hadgone mad and me too i says be so good as fall back on your french sirknowing that then i shouldnt have the agonies of trying to understandhim which was a happy release</s>  not that i lost much more than the resteither for i generally noticed that when he had described something verylong indeed and i says to jemmy what does he say jemmy</s>  jemmy sayslooking with vengeance in his eye he is so jolly indistinct</s>  and thatwhen he had described it longer all over again and i says to jemmy welljemmy whats it all about</s>  jemmy says he says the building was repairedin seventeen hundred and four gran</s>
wherever that prowling young man formed his prowling habits i cannot beexpected to know but the way in which he went round the corner while wehad our breakfasts and was there again when we swallowed the last crumbwas most marvellous and just the same at dinner and at night prowlingequally at the theatre and the inn gateway and the shop doors when webought a trifle or two and everywhere else but troubled with a tendencyto spit</s>  and of paris i can tell you no more my dear than that its townand country both in one and carved stone and long streets of high housesand gardens and fountains and statues and trees and gold and immenselybig soldiers and immensely little soldiers and the pleasantest nurseswith the whitest caps a playing at skippingrope with the bunchiestbabies in the flattest caps and clean tablecloths spread everywhere fordinner and people sitting out of doors smoking and sipping all day longand little plays being acted in the open air for little people and everyshop a complete and elegant room and everybody seeming to play ateverything in this world</s>
 and pretty well the only thing thatgrated on me was that whether you pay your fare at the railway or whetheryou change your money at a moneydealers or whether you take your ticketat the theatre the lady or gentleman is caged up i suppose bygovernment behind the strongest iron bars having more of a zoologicalappearance than a free country</s> well to be sure when i did after all get my precious bones to bed thatnight and my young rogue came in to kiss me and asks what do you thinkof this lovely lovely paris gran</s>  i says jemmy i feel as if it wasbeautiful fireworks being let off in my head</s>  and very cool andrefreshing the pleasant country was next day when we went on to lookafter my legacy and rested me much and did me a deal of good</s> so at length and at last my dear we come to sens a pretty little townwith a great twotowered cathedral and the rooks flying in and out of theloopholes and another tower atop of one of the towers like a sort of astone pulpit</s>  in which pulpit with the birds skimming below him ifyoull believe me i saw a speck while i was resting at the inn beforedinner which they made signs to me was jemmy and which really was</s>  i hadbeen a fancying as i sat in the balcony of the hotel that an angel mightlight there and call down to the people to be good but i little thoughtwhat jemmy all unknown to himself was a calling down from that high placeto some one in the town</s> the pleasantestsituated inn my dear</s>  right under the two towers withtheir shadows a changing upon it all day like a kind of a sundial andcountry people driving in and out of the courtyard in carts and hoodedcabriolets and such like and a market outside in front of the cathedraland all so quaint and like a picter</s>  the major and me agreed thatwhatever came of my legacy this was the place to stay in for our holidayand we also agreed that our dear boy had best not be checked in his joythat night by the sight of the englishman if he was still alive but thatwe would go together and alone</s>  for you are to understand that the majornot feeling himself quite equal in his wind to the height to which jemmyhad climbed had come back to me and left him with the guide</s> so after dinner when jemmy had set off to see the river the major wentdown to the mairie and presently came back with a military character ina sword and spurs and a cocked hat and a yellow shoulderbelt and longtags about him that he must have found inconvenient</s>  and the major saysthe englishman still lies in the same state dearest madam</s>  thisgentleman will conduct us to his lodging</s>  upon which the militarycharacter pulled off his cocked hat to me and i took notice that he hadshaved his forehead in imitation of napoleon bonaparte but not like</s>
we wont out at the courtyard gate and past the great doors of thecathedral and down a narrow high street where the people were sittingchatting at their shop doors and the children were at play</s>  the militarycharacter went in front and he stopped at a porkshop with a littlestatue of a pig sitting up in the window and a private door that adonkey was looking out of</s> when the donkey saw the military character he came slipping out on thepavement to turn round and then clattered along the passage into a backyard</s>  so the coast being clear the major and me were conducted up thecommon stair and into the front room on the second a bare room with ared tiled floor and the outside lattice blinds pulled close to darken it</s>
it was some kind of brain fever he had had and his hair was all goneand some wetted folded linen lay upon his head</s>  i looked at him veryattentive as he lay there all wasted away with his eyes closed and isays to the majori never saw this face before</s> the major looked at him very attentive too and he says i never saw thisface before</s> when the major explained our words to the military character thatgentleman shrugged his shoulders and showed the major the card on whichit was written about the legacy for me</s>  it had been written with a weakand trembling hand in bed and i knew no more of the writing than of theface</s>  neither did the major</s> though lying there alone the poor creetur was as well taken care of ascould be hoped and would have been quite unconscious of any onessitting by him then</s>  i got the major to say that we were not going awayat present and that i would come back tomorrow and watch a bit by thebedside</s>  but i got him to addand i shook my head hard to make itstrongerwe agree that we never saw this face before</s> our boy was greatly surprised when we told him sitting out in the balconyin the starlight and he ran over some of those stories of formerlodgers of the majors putting down and asked wasnt it possible thatit might be this lodger or that lodger</s>  it was not possible and we wentto bed</s>
 so i says to the major andjemmy you two boys go and enjoy yourselves and ill take my prayerbook and go sit by the bed</s>  so i went and i sat there some hoursreading a prayer for him poor soul now and then and it was quite on inthe day when he moved his hand</s> he had been so still that the moment he moved i knew of it and i pulledoff my spectacles and laid down my book and rose and looked at him</s>  frommoving one hand he began to move both and then his action was the actionof a person groping in the dark</s>  long after his eyes had opened therewas a film over them and he still felt for his way out into light</s>  butby slow degrees his sight cleared and his hands stopped</s>  he saw theceiling he saw the wall he saw me</s>  as his sight cleared mine clearedtoo and when at last we looked in one anothers faces i started backand i cries passionatelyo you wicked wicked man</s>  your sin has found you out</s> for i knew him the moment life looked out of his eyes to be mr</s>  edsonjemmys father who had so cruelly deserted jemmys young unmarried motherwho had died in my arms poor tender creetur and left jemmy to me</s> you cruel wicked man</s>  you bad black traitor</s> with the little strength he had he made an attempt to turn over on hiswretched face to hide it</s>  his arm dropped out of the bed and his headwith it and there he lay before me crushed in body and in mind</s>
o blessed heaven i says a crying teach me what to say to this brokenmortal</s>  i am a poor sinful creetur and the judgment is not mine</s> as i lifted my eyes up to the clear bright sky i saw the high towerwhere jemmy had stood above the birds seeing that very window and thelast look of that poor pretty young mother when her soul brightened andgot free seemed to shine down from it</s> o man man man</s>  i says and i went on my knees beside the bed ifyour heart is rent asunder and you are truly penitent for what you didour saviour will have mercy on you yet</s> as i leaned my face against the bed his feeble hand could just moveitself enough to touch me</s>  i hope the touch was penitent</s>  it tried tohold my dress and keep hold but the fingers were too weak to close</s> i lifted him back upon the pillows and i says to himcan you hear me</s>
he looked yes</s> do you know me</s> he looked yes even yet more plainly</s> i am not here alone</s>  the major is with me</s>  you recollect the major</s> yes</s>  that is to say he made out yes in the same way as before</s>

 and every soul about the hotel down to the pigeons in thecourtyard made friends with jemmy and the major and went lumbering awaywith them on all sorts of expeditions in all sorts of vehicles drawn byrampagious carthorseswith heads and withoutmud for paint and ropesfor harnessand every new friend dressed in blue like a butcher andevery new horse standing on his hind legs wanting to devour and consumeevery other horse and every man that had a whip to crack crackcrackcrackcrackcracking it as if it was a schoolboy with his first</s>  as tothe major my dear that man lived the greater part of his time with alittle tumbler in one hand and a bottle of small wine in the other andwhenever he saw anybody else with a little tumbler no matter who itwasthe military character with the tags or the innservants at theirsupper in the courtyard or townspeople a chatting on a bench or countrypeople a starting home after marketdown rushes the major to clink hisglass against their glasses and cryhola</s>  vive somebody</s>  or vivesomething</s>  as if he was beside himself</s>  and though i could not quiteapprove of the majors doing it still the ways of the world are the waysof the world varying according to the different parts of it and dancingat all in the open square with a lady that kept a barbers shop myopinion is that the major was right to dance his best and to lead offwith a power that i did not think was in him though i was a littleuneasy at the barricading sound of the cries that were set up by theother dancers and the rest of the company until when i says what arethey ever calling out jemmy</s>
