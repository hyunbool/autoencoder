pretty chambers were in the rococo taste of the fine oldrococo time with successive scenes of the same history painted over thefireplaces throughout the suite the drawingroom was elegant with silkhangings and carved mirrors and the noble staircase whose landing washonored with the bust of the french king of the chteaus period lookedas if that prince had just mounted it</s>  all these splendors with themodern comfort of hot and cold water wherever needed you may have ifyou like for 500 a year and none of the castles i saw compared withthis chteau in richness of finish or furnishing</s>  i am rather particularto advertise it because a question painfully debating itself in my mindthroughout my visit as to the sum i ought to offer the woman wasawkwardly settled by her refusing to take anything and i feel alingering obligation</s>  but really i do not see how the reader if helikes solitary state or has daughters to educate or baddish boys tokeep out of mischief or is wearing out a heavy disappointment or issuffering under one of those little stains or uneasy consciences such aspeople can manage so much better in europei say i do not see how hecould suit himself more perfectly or more cheaply than in that pensivelysuperb old chteau with its aristocratic seclusion and possiblymalarious lovely old garden</s> illustration tour up the lakeviiearly in october before the vintage began we seized the first fineday which the dentdumidi lifted its cap of mists the night before topromise and made an early start for the tour of the lake</s>  mademoiselleand her cousins came with us and we all stood together at the steamersprow to watch the morning sunshine break through the silvery haze thathung over villeneuve dimly pierced by the ghostly poplars wandering upthe road beside the rhone</s>  as we started the clouds drifted inineffable beauty over the mountainsides one slowly dropped upon thelake and when we had sailed through it we had come in sight of thefirst town on the french border which the gendarmes of the two nationsseemed to share equally between them</s>
 all these lakeside villages arewonderfully picturesque but this first one had a fancy in chimneytopswhich i think none of the rest equalledsome were twisted some shapedlike little chalets and there were groups of old woodcolored roofs andgables which were luxuries of color</s>  a halfbuilt railroad wasstruggling along the shore at times it seemed to stop hopelessly thenit began again and then left off to reappear beyond some point of hillwhich had not yet been bored through or blown quite away</s>  i have neverseen a railroad laboring under so many difficulties</s>  the landscape wasnow grand and beautiful like new england now pretty and soft like oldengland till we came to evainslesbains which looked like nothing butthe french wateringplace it was</s>  it looked like a wateringplace thatwould be very gay in the season there were lots of pretty boats therewas a most officiallooking gendarme in a cocked hat and two jollyyoung priests joking together and there were green frivolous frenchfishes swimming about in the water and apparently left behind when therest of the brilliant world had flown</s> here the little english artist who had been so sociable all the way fromvilleneuve was reinforced by other englishmen whom we found on the muchmore crowded boat to which we had to change</s>  our company began todiversify itself there were french and german parties as well asenglish</s>  we changed boats four times in the tour of the lake and eachboat brought us a fresh accession of passengers</s>  byandby there cameaboard a brave italian with birds in cages and goldfish in vases witha gay southern face a coral neck button a brown mustache and imperialand a blacktasselled red fez that consoled</s>  he was the vividest bit ofcolor in our composition though we were not wanting in life withouthim</s>  there began to be some americans besides ourselves and a prettygirl of our nation who occupied a public station at the boats prowseemed to know that she was pretty but probably did not</s>  she willrecognize herself in this sketch but who was that other pretty maidenwith brown eyes wide apart and upper lip projecting a little as ifpulled out by the piquantnose</s>  i must have taken her portrait socarefully because i thought she would work somewhere into fiction butthe reader is welcome to her as she is</s>  he may also have thespirituelle english girl who ordered tea and added i want somektzchens with my tea</s>  ktzchens</s>  ktzchen is a little cat</s>  yesits a word of my own invention</s>  these are the brilliant littlepassages of foreign travel that make a voyage to europe worth while</s>  iadd to this international gallery the german girl in blue calico whohad so strong a belief that she was elegantly dressed that she came upon deck with her coffee and drank it where we might all admire her</s>  iintersperse also the comment that it is the germans who seem to prevailnow in any given international group and that they have the air ofcoming forward to take the front seats as by right while the englishonce so confident of their superiority seem to yield the places tothem</s>  but i dare say this is all my fancy</s> i am sure however of the evervarying grandeur and beauty of the alpsall round us</s>  those of the savoyard shore had a softer loveliness thanthe swiss as if the south had touched and mellowed them as it had thelightcolored trousers which in geneva recalled the joyous pantaloons ofitaly</s>  these mountains moulded themselves one upon another and deepenedbehind their transparent shadows with a thousand dimmer and tendererdyes in the autumnal foliage</s>  from time to time a village graywalledbrownroofed broke the low helving shore of the lake where the poplarsrose and the vineyards spread with a monotony that somehow pleased andat nyon a twelfthcentury castle as noble as chillon offered thedelight of its changing lines as the boat approached and passed</s> at geneva we had barely time to think rousseau to think calvin tothink voltaire to drive swiftly through the town and back again to theboat fuming and fretting to be off</s>  there is an old town gravelypicturesque and austerely fine in its fine old burgherly calvinisticexclusive way and outside the walls there is a new town very cleanvery cold very quiet with horsecars like boston and a newrenaissance theatre like paris</s>  the impression remains that geneva isoutwardly a small moralized bostonian paris and i suppose the readerknows that it has had its political rings and bosses like new york</s>  italso has an exact reproduction of the veronese tombs of the scaligeriwhich the eccentric duke of brunswick who died in geneva willed it themoney to build like most facsimiles they are easily distinguishablefrom the original and you must still go to verona to see the tombs ofthe scaligeri</s>  but they have the real mont blanc at geneva bleak to theeye with enduring snow and the blue rhone rushing smooth and swiftunder the overhanging balconies of quaint old houses</s>  with its neatquays azure lake symmetrical hotel fronts and white steamboatsgeneva was like an admirable illustration printed in colors for aholiday number to imitate a watercolor sketch</s> when we started we were detained a moment by conjugal affection</s>  a ladywho had already kept the boat waiting stopped midway up the gangplankto kiss her husband in parting in spite of the captains loud cries ofallez</s>  allez</s>  and the angry derision of the passengers</s>  we were infact all furious and it was as much as a mule team with bells drawinga wagon loaded with bags of flower and a tree growing out of a towerbeside the lake could do to put me in goodhumor</s>  yet i was not reallyin a hurry to have the voyage end i was enjoying every moment of itonly when your boat starts you do not want to stop for a woman to kissher husband</s> again we were passing the wild savoyard shore where the yellow tops ofthe poplars jutted up like spires from the roadsides and on thehillsides tracts of dark evergreens blotted their space out of thevaster expanses of autumn foliage back of all rose gray cliffs andcrags</s>  now and then we met a boat of our line otherwise the bluestretch of the water was broken only by the lateensails of theblackhulked lake craft</s>  at that season the delicate flame of thevirginiacreeper was a prominent tint on the walls all round the lake</s> lausanne which made us think gibbon of course was a stately stretchof architecture along her terraces vevay showed us her quaint marketsquare and her old church on its heights then came montreux with itsmanyhotelled slopes and levels and chalets peeping from the brows ofthe mountains that crowd it upon the lake</s>  all these places keepmultitudes of swans whose snow reddened in the sunset that stained thewater more and more darkly crimson till we landed at villeneuve</s> viiiwhen december came and the vintage and elections were over and thewinter had come down into the valley to stay italy called to us moreand more appealingly</s> yet it was not so easy to pull up and go</s>  i liked the rowboat on thelake though it was getting too cold and rough for that i liked the waythe railway guards called out verneymontreux</s>  and territeychillon</s> as they ran alongside the carriages at these stations i liked thepastel portraits of mademoiselles grandmothers on the gray walls of ourpretty chamber that overlooked the lake and overheard the lightest lispof that sometimes bellowing body of water i liked the notion of thewildducks among the reeds by the rhone though i had no wish to killthem i liked our little corner fireplace where i covered a log of thegrand bois every night in the coals and found it a perfect line ofbristling embers in the morning i liked poppi and the three generationsof boulettes and yes i liked mademoiselle and all her boarders and ihated to leave these friends</s>  mademoiselle made a grand thanksgivingsupper in honor of the american nation for which we did our best tofigure both at the table where smoked a turkey driven over the alpsfrom his italian home for that fte there are no swiss turkeys and inthe dance for which he had wellnigh disabled us</s>  poppi was in uncommontune that night and the voice of this pensive rheumatic lent a uniqueinterest to every change of the virginia reel</s> but these pleasures had to end it grew colder and colder we had longsince consumed all the old graperoots which constituted our petitbois and we were ravaging our way through an expensive pile of grandbois without much effect upon the climate</s>  one morning the mostenterprising spirit of our party kindled such a mighty blaze on ourchamber hearth that she set the chimney on fire thus threatening theswiss republic with the loss of the insurance and involvingmademoiselle in i know not what penalties for having a chimney thatcould be set on fire</s>  by the blessing of heaven the vigor ofmademoiselle and the activity of louis and alexis the farmer theflames were subdued and the house saved</s>  mademoiselle forgave us but weknew it was time to go and the next sunday we were in florence</s> the end</s>
